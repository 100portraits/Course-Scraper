A Divided House: An Analysis of Parliamentary Voting Divisions in the Dutch Parliament,"Vorsteveld, Luc Frederik","['Otjes, S.P.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study is an effort to extrapolate the patterns that exist in parliamentary voting in the Dutch Parliament. It investigates what party- and vote characteristics influence the divisions between coalition and opposition and between left and right that exist in parliamentary voting. Using a triadic model on all recorded votes in the 2017-2021 parliamentary term, this study finds that the proposing actor, proposal type, and proposal subject are relevant predictors of the division that will come about in a parliamentary vote. Specifically, this study provides evidence for three points. Firstly, amendments, bills, and budgets are found to have a stronger left-right division than motions, which have a more dominant coalition-opposition split. Secondly, proposals from opposition parties are found to have a stronger coalition- opposition division than proposals from the government or coalition. Thirdly, contrary to theoretical expectations, this study only finds very limited effect of topical ideological distance on votes pertaining to said topic. The effect is only significant for proposals on economics and environment. This study contributes to the literature by using an extensive dataset and an innovative triadic method. In doing so, this study has attempted to further understanding of parliamentary behaviour based on coalition- and opposition membership and ideology in the Dutch Parliament.","['Parliamentary behaviour', 'coalition-opposition dynamics', 'ideology', 'parliament', 'the Netherlands']"
Mechanisms of Acknowledging Colonial Crimes: The German-Namibian Case,"Keppler, Marvin","['Kinacioğlu, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Placed in the broader literature of states’ foreign policy behavior this research addresses a so far understudied question, namely what explains Germany’s acknowledgment of its colonial crimes committed in today’s Namibia during the Ovaherero and Nama rebellion between 1904 and 1908. Observing a general reluctance of European states to reconcile with the colonial past and looking at the therefore somewhat surprising German-Namibian case, I propose two possible causal mechanisms based on liberal theory and rhetorical entrapment to account for this rare policy outcome. According to the liberal theory mechanism, I expect former colonial powers to acknowledge colonial crimes if domestic interests change state preferences towards reconciliation with the colonial past. According to the rhetorical entrapment approach, I expect former colonial powers to acknowledge colonial crimes if political costs increase due to the strategic use of rhetorical entrapment by domestic and international actors. This is an explanatory single case study employing process tracing and using data from party publications, government and interest groups’ public statements, and parliamentary debate. I find support for both hypotheses and show that the mechanisms interacted with each other illustrating important implications for other cases of German colonial violence and reconciliation processes of other European states.","['foreign policy behavior', 'acknowledgment of colonial crimes', 'Ovaherero and Nama genocide', 'liberal theory', 'rhetorical entrapment']"
How does the EU justify the tradeoff between freedom and security? The Digital Services Act as a case study.,"Fadi, Sara",['Gjovalin Macaj'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Framing a societal issue as a matter of national security is a powerful motivator that, when used strategically, can elicit unprecedented outcomes. Recently, the EU adopted a novel regulation aimed at establishing rules upon one of the most unrestrained areas: online platforms. The adoption of the Digital Services Act, marked a shift within two of the most regarded values in democratic societies: freedom and security, leaning heavily towards the latter due to the restrictive notions that are now being promoted upon a previously unregulated realm. This situation leads to wonder, how does the EU justify the tradeoff between freedom and security? Through a discourse analysis methodology, that studied the preeminence of a securitizing discourse, versus two other rival frames: Novelty, understood as seeking to hold a first mover advantage at regulating a sector and Equity, as a yearning to promote EU values through regulation, it was found that the negotiation process of the DSA showed strong indications of a securitizing discourse, which frames the adverse effects of online platforms as a matter of national security. This leads to conclude that EU policymakers securitized the discourse around online platforms to succeed where others failed at regulating the internet.","['Digital Services Act', 'Tradeoff', 'Freedom', 'Security', 'EU Decision-making', 'Securitization', 'Proportionality']"
Towards a Green Climate Policy World: a Bumpy Ride of Perceptions?,"Bouweriks, Mees","['Kinacioglu, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Ever since various IPCC reports have shown the impact and consequences of human action on the climate, an increasing number of policymakers start to realize the urgency of altering the way humans deal with it. Consequently, climate policies have emerged in the European political realm aimed at mitigating climate change. However, Europe has seen a recent rise of farmer protest movements that oppose these climate policies. Often labelled as being ‘anti-climate’, these protest movements seem to have deeper underlying causes. Policy perception impacts the way citizens react, which should be considered during the implementation of policy. This thesis analyses the cases of Germany and the Netherlands with interview data of various protest groups elites and experts. It argues that when citizens feel that climate policies are unfair, exclusive, untrustworthy and their financial costs are perceived as high, protest movements will arise and intensify. In addition, results show that perceived sociocultural costs are most important for protest movement emergence and intensification. Policymakers should deal with these perceptions adequately if they want to implement climate policies effectively.","['climate policy, farmer protests, protest movements, policy perception, the Netherlands, Germany']"
The Impact of the European Union Election Observation Missions on Strengthening Election Quality,"Accame, Ginevra","['Kinacioglu, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This research explores the potential impact of EU election observation missions on the quality of elections, through the diffusion of democratic standards. The analysis is based on a single-case study of the Kenyan elections building on diverse data including reports and interviews, applied in the process tracing method. Building on socialization theory and norm diffusion, I hypothesize that election observation has an impact on election quality, through the diffusion of democratic values. The Kenyan legal framework meets international obligations requiring elections to be “accountable and transparent”. But the tumultuous history of election violence highlighted fundamental issues and systematic problems that must be addressed. The findings show that there is a relevant added value to the presence of EU EOM, within different phases of the election cycle. The implementation of the EU EOM recommendations plays a key role in understanding the contribution of election observation to improve election quality. EU EOMs are found to be effective in deterring fraud and corruption, as election observation contributes to pressuring government officials to respect the electoral law. In the Kenyan case, the implementation of recommendations contributed to the mitigation of election-related violence, and the promotion of the stakeholders' confidence in the electoral process.","['Election observation', 'Election monitoring', 'Kenya', 'Election quality', 'European Union']"
The influence of one-sided violence on conflict onset across the border,"Flokstra, Sean","['Haer, R. van der']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"How are external factors able to cause conflict in a country? Scholars have examined the spatial component of conflict largely through the lens of conflict diffusion, where conflict spread from one country to another. They have failed however, to examine the influence of one-sided violence on conflict in other countries. This is a major gap as one-sided violence does not necessarily mean conflict is occurring, meaning studies on the direct spread of conflict between countries fail to cover these cases. I fill this gap by asking: does the use of one-sided violence raise the likelihood of conflict onset in neighbouring countries? I argue that one-sided violence influences conflict onset in three ways, each via incoming refugee flows. First, refugees might have grievances that they are unable to express via traditional ways, increasing the likelihood that they may turn to violence. Second, refugees may change the ethnic composition of the host country, with the new ethnic balance causing or worsening ethnic tensions. Third, refugees may worsen the economic situation in the host country by competing with the local population, increasing local political tensions. I will study this by analyzing UCDP data on armed conflict and one-sided violence in neighboring countries. The results show that one-sided violence in neighbouring countries has a positive, significant effect on conflict onset. Countries that border countries experiencing one-sided violence have a higher likelihood of conflict occurring. The effect of refugees on conflict onset is shown to be positive and significant as well.","['one-sided violence', 'conflict onset']"
"A Democratic Retrograde Experience of a Developing Country, Turkey's Journey to Competitive Authoritarianism and the Public Consent","Güngör, Ömer Faruk","['Macaj, G.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to contribute to understanding how a competitive authoritarian leader manages to increase popular support in a situation where an electoral democracy experiences democratic backsliding. After the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016 in Turkey, Erdogan put the constitution aside and launched a new model for governing the state with decree laws under the state of emergency. However, Erdogan won the elections held in the following years by increasing his vote share, although he had explicitly turned into a repressive, authoritarian leader. In this study, I investigated how Erdogan strengthened his popular support in the elections held after 2016, despite his authoritarian turn and the deterioration of the socio-economic structure of the state. I focused on the manipulations carried out by the incumbents in the elections held after 2016 and tested whether these manipulations affected the election results in favour of Erdogan. I conducted a content analysis using the qualitative research method to explore this. Ultimately, I argue that the analysis of the data collected for this study provides strong evidence that election manipulations may have significant effects on the election results in favour of Erdogan.",

Volunteering for Outgroup Charities: A Cross-Sectional Survey Study on how Affinity and Openness to Diversity Affect Willingness to Volunteer among the American Population,"Walpurgius, Anna-Katharina","['Boezeman, E.J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study concerns willingness to volunteer for non-profit organisations (NPOs), and assesses aspects suspected to account for why people decide to volunteer for a charity. Our study was a cross-sectional survey study among members of the American public (N = 143) and tested whether affinity with an NPO as well as openness to diversity affect willingness to volunteer for an NPO of which one is not a member (an outgroup NPO). We detected, based on a multiple regression analysis, that affinity with an outgroup NPO directly and positively predicts likeability of the NPO while openness to diversity is controlled for. Subsequently, a mediation regression analysis displayed that affinity with an outgroup NPO affects willingness to volunteer indirectly via likeability of the NPO. Moreover, a separate multiple regression analysis showed openness to diversity to directly and positively relate to perspective-taking if controlling for affinity. Yet, as also displayed by a mediation regression analysis, openness to diversity does not indirectly relate to willingness to volunteer through perspective-taking. Thus, as a last multiple regression analysis yielded, likeability of an outgroup NPO, but not perspective-taking, directly and positively predicts willingness to volunteer for the NPO. Additionally, a moderation regression analysis indicated that affinity with an outgroup NPO and openness to diversity do not interact to influence likability of the NPO. Theoretical and practical implications, limitations as well as suggestions for future research are discussed.","['volunteering, affinity, openness to diversity, likeability, perspective-taking']"
Are a child’s fear beliefs influenced by their parents’ expression of threat vs safety? Does having child social anxiety increase fear beliefs?,"Boekaar, Dewy","['Aktar, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"To look at how a parent’s verbal communication can influence a child’s development of fear beliefs, a study called STARs Leiden was conducted using different social interaction tasks. During this research 72 participants between the ages 10 and 14 years were examined to see how parental verbal transmission of threat vs safety about strangers influenced fear beliefs. This was examined by offering the children the following three tasks: a speech about shyness and confidence, that was being recorded, watching the recording of their speech with a stranger and lastly a speech about their overall performance. Before any engagement took place the parent of each child pointed to an image of two strangers and declared that one is “nice”, and one is “tough”. After this the child had to fill in a questionnaire about fear beliefs about both judges. The child also had to fill in the child anxiety SCARED questionnaire before completing any of the tasks. An ANOVA was used to see if parental expression of threat vs safety had an influence on a child’s reported fear beliefs, these results were significant. Secondly, an ANOVA was also used to see if a child that scored high on social anxiety (when looking at the results on the child anxiety SCARED) also had more fear beliefs, however, these results did not yield a significant effect.",
Wat is het effect van communicatiemedia en sociale motieven op groepsonderhandelingen?,"Verhagen, Sara",['Wolfgang Steinel'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"What is the effect of communication media and social motives on group negotiations? It was predicted that the trust in others and joint outcomes would be dependent on social motives and communication media. It was expected that within pro-social groups the trust in others would be larger and the joint outcomes would be higher, compared to the pro-self groups. Additionally, it was expected that in face-to-face group negotiations the trust in others would be larger and the joint outcomes higher, compared to the use of communication medium. Through the use of the ‘Aloha Beach Club’ roleplay, where face-to-face or online group negotiations within groups of three took place, these predictions were researched. To test the predictions a 2 (social motive: pro-social vs pro-self) by 2 (communication channel: face-toface vs online) (M)ANOVA was executed. The results of the pro-social group were significantly higher in terms of joint outcomes and significantly larger in terms of the trust in others, compared to the pro-self groups. The use of a communication medium did not influence the trust in others, nor did it influence the joint outcomes.","['sociale motieven', 'communicatiemedia', 'groepsonderhandelingen']"

Am I paralyzed by stress? The impact of stress and attention on exploration behaviour as measured by roaming entropy,"Huizer, Sterre","['Schomaker, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The effect of stress on the exploration of new environments has shown to be impacted by individual preferences in novelty seeking in rodents, in which high stressed rodents explore novel stimuli more compared to low stressed rodents. Whereas studies to examine the way this behaviour is expressed in humans have been conducted, the effect of stress and attention on this behaviour has not. In this study, we tested for a relationship between stress, attention, and the combination of these two on the degree of exploration in humans. Participants were divided up among the low and high stress condition in the Sing-a-Song Stress Test (SSST) before roaming a virtual environment after which they were tested on their ability to recollect landmarks from that environment and having to complete a questionnaire to establish attention control. The SSST affected participants in the high stress condition more than in the low stress condition, showing the SSST to be effective as conditioning tool. However, participants’ virtual distance travelled and attention as measured by the Attention Control Scale Test did not reveal any relationship between stress, attention, and exploration behaviour. This suggests that, contrary to rodents, subjective stress and attention do not factor in exploration behaviour in humans. If such a link does however exist, further research on stress, attention, and exploration behaviour could help construct stress coping mechanisms for high-pressure situations and to assist people with stress- and attention deficit disorders.","['stress, attention, exploration behaviour, roaming entropy, virtual environment, spatial memory, Sing-a-Song Stress Test, Attention Control Scale']"
Intolerance of uncertainty and attachment style do not seem to predict the updating of self-related feelings.,"Valkhof, Kimberly","['van der Molen, M.J.W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Concepts such as self-esteem and the perception of self are significant for a multitude of reasons, one of them being one’s satisfaction in life. This makes research into affective updating important. One form of affective updating can be described as updating feelings about yourself based on feedback that has been received from others. To gain a better understanding of affective updating, the main focus of this study was to investigate the influence of intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and attachment style on the updating of self-relating feelings. Intolerance of uncertainty can be defined as a bias that demonstrates how people see vague situations as threats. While attachment style is characterized as a framework of behaviours, emotions and expectations we exhibit in close relationships. Three hypotheses were tested using data collected from a larger study. To test the hypotheses, a speech task, in which three judges would be watching, and two questionnaires (ECR-R and IUS) were used. The speech task was used to measure how social feedback changes one’s self-perception. The total sample size contained 144 participants with ages ranging from 18 to 29. Results of this study indicate that there is no significant association between IU and affective updating, nor that attachment style predicts affective updating in this context. However, adults with more anxiety regarding attachment were found to have a higher amount of IU. This finding should be taken into account for future treatment regarding people with high attachment anxiety, as it could prevent further development of high IU and SAD.","['Intolerance of uncertainty', 'Affective updating', 'Attachment']"
The Relation Between Depressed Mood and Life Quality in Patients with Chronic Itch: Do Higher Depression Scores on the DASS-21 Affect Quality of Life in Patients with Chronic Itch?,"Albrecht, Emma","['Becker, J.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The more the daily functioning of an individual is disturbed, the lower their life satisfaction is expected to be. This paper focused on the question whether higher depression scores predict lower Quality-of-Life (QoL) for patients with chronic itch. Previous research has found a connection between depression and intensity of itch, thus decreasing quality of life. It was expected to find supporting evidence that a higher score on the depression scale would indicate lower quality of life for participants with chronic itch. This online study was conducted remotely, and consisted of five questionnaires and two reaction time tasks. Afterwards, the data for depression (DASS-21) and quality of life (QoL) for the chronic itch group was analyzed. Contrary to expectations, the hypothesis of higher depression predicting lower quality of life, was rejected. Coping strategies, stigma and level of etiology could have impacted the result. This study had several limitations, including lack of participants due to time-frame of data collection, and strict eligibility criteria. Due to limited research on chronic itch, it is still an unsolved mystery where it originates, and what causes and influences its symptoms. Future research should focus on the importance between psychosocial well-being and chronic itch, within more general populations and thus different levels of etiology. Lastly, it is necessary to conduct further investigation in order to find reasons behind the symptoms, solutions for them, and increase overall life quality for patients with chronic itch, despite being clinically or sub clinically depressed.","['Chronic itch, Pruritus, Psoriasis, Atopic Dermatitis, Depression, Quality of Life']"
The effect of neuroticism and stress on exploratory behavior in virtual environments,"Hamwijk, Nina","['Schomaker, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Neuroticism is a personality trait that has been associated with higher stress intensity and a poor ability to cope with stress. Research has also linked neuroticism with daily spatial behavior and roaming entropy, affirming that higher neuroticism negatively influences these factors. In the current research we examined whether highly neurotic individuals showed lower distance traveled, and whether this effect was different after stress induction. The sing-a-song stress test (SSST) was used to induce stress in half of the participants, their distance traveled was then measured based on their exploration behavior in a virtual environment. The participants filled out the big five personality questionnaire and their neuroticism score was calculated. The results showed no effects of neuroticism on distance traveled, regardless of stress induction or lack thereof. We also found no link between neuroticism and stress, or between stress and distance traveled. The results did show that the SSST increased stress level, in line with the expectations. In conclusion, the outcomes of this research did not find a link between neuroticism, stress and roaming entropy, this is not in line with earlier done research and further testing is necessary.","['Neuroticism, stress, exploratory behavior, virtual environments']"

De prevalentie van mentale ziektes zoals post-traumatische stressstoornis (PTSS), depressie en angst is hoger bij vluchtelingen dan bij mensen die niet op de vlucht zijn. Er zijn verschillende behandelmethoden ontwikkelt die proberen de mate van PTSS, depressie en angst te verminderen, zoals cognitieve gedragstherapie (CGT), narrative exposure therapie (NET) of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). Door culturele overtuigingen kunnen symptomen van mentale ziektes en denkbeelden over behandelmethoden verschillen tussen culturen. Het doel van deze systematische review is om door middel van een meta-analyse te achterhalen of er verschil is in de effectiviteit van psychosociale behandelmethoden voor PTSS, depressie en angst bij westerse versus niet westerse vluchtelingen. Resultaten Psychosociale behandelmethoden hebben een significant verlagend effect op de mate van PTSS, depressie en angst bij vluchtelingen. Voor PTSS is dit effect z = -13.883, p < .001, voor depressie is dit effect z = -9.062, p < .001 en voor angst is dit effect z = -9.375, p < .001.

Bestaat er een relatie tussen stress en de kwaliteit van leven bij patiënten met chronische jeuk?,"Braam, Benthe",['J. Becker'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Chronische jeuk is in vergelijking met pijn tot op heden weinig onderzocht. In dit onderzoek wordt het duidelijk dat stress jeuk verergert en dat jeuk de kwaliteit van leven vermindert. Maar er is weinig bekend over welk effect stress kan hebben op de kwaliteit van leven bij patiënten met chronische jeuk. Binnen dit onderzoek is er daarom gekeken in hoeverre stress een invloed heeft op de kwaliteit van leven bij patiënten met chronische jeuk. Om een antwoord te geven op de onderzoeksvraag is een experiment uitgevoerd waarbij participanten online vragenlijsten moesten afleggen en taken moesten doen. Uiteindelijk is er een steekproef overgebleven van 10 participanten. De hypothese dat hogere stress zorgt voor een lagere kwaliteit van leven werd niet ondersteunt. Het regressiemodel was niet significant en daarbij bleek dat de variabele stress de kwaliteit van leven ook niet significant voorspelt. Stress voorspelt voor 18,4% de score op kwaliteit van leven. De regressielijn loopt in de richting zoals verwacht was. Toch zitten er wat kanttekeningen aan dit onderzoek en zijn er adviezen voor toekomstig onderzoek opgesteld. Er zijn in totaal weinig participanten gebruikt en de man/vrouw- en leeftijdsverhoudingen klopten ook niet. Voor volgend onderzoek is het van belang dat hier beter naar gekeken wordt. Daarnaast wordt er aanbevolen om meer rekening te houden met de concepten stigma en coping. Al met al is het belangrijk dat er meer onderzoek naar jeuk gedaan wordt, zodat er betere behandelingsplannen gemaakt kunnen worden.",
Cross-validation: evaluating the claims in psychological research,"Ruwe, Olga","['Weeda, W.D.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Psychological research has mostly been focused on finding an explanation for behavior, rather than on finding a model that accurately predicts behavior. This approach often results in the use of models that fit very well to the sample used for testing but are difficult to generalize to new samples. Similarly, models are often too complex and take into consideration too many variables. Classically, replications would be performed to account for these issues. This is however an expensive, time-consuming, and laborious process, leading to the perpetuation of nonreplicated studies in psychology. This thesis presents a possible solution stemming from the field of machine learning, namely using cross-validation. With cross-validation, the predictive performance of a model can be assessed using only one dataset. This thesis examined the use of cross-validation by applying it over an existing dataset and comparing its output to the output of conventional null-hypothesis testing. The results show that using cross-validation reduces the likelihood of making overly optimistic claims, by reducing the chances of using excessively complex models unable to generalize to new samples. Furthermore, cross-validation gives the opportunity to examine the predictability of models while preserving the explanatory power. It therefore proves to be a useful tool in the field of psychological research.","['cross-validation', 'model complexity', 'prediction versus explanation', 'replication', 'generalization']"
The Impact of Oxytocin and Psychopathic Traits on Prosocial Reinforcement Learning,"Medenica, Barbara",['Marc Molendijk'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Humans are social beings who live their daily lives through mainly social interaction and behaviours. The reinforcement learning theory states/predicts that consequences of behaviours are learned through an action-outcome association of stimuli. In order to help someone, one must understand what the context-specific action would lead to. In the current study, it was tested whether reinforcement learning is influenced by the administration of oxytocin and whether its hypothesized effect is moderated by psychopathic traits. The sample size consisted of thirty male participants, in the range of 19 and 34 years old. The participants were given a probabilistic reinforcement learning task, in form of a monetary-reward game to play for three different agents: either themselves, others, or no one. The repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of time, indicating that reinforcement learning improves through repeated trials. On the other hand, the administration of oxytocin and the presence of psychopathic traits had no statistically significant effect on one’s ability to learn through reinforcement. Interactions between reinforcement learning, the agent played for, oxytocin administration, and psychopathic traits were not evident in the data. Thus the current investigation indicates the presence of psychopathic traits or the administration of oxytocin does not correlate with reinforcement learning in our sample. However, our study’s broad age range poses a limitation due to a likely variety in cognition within participants, which may be an important consideration for future researchers.","['psychopathic traits, reinforcement learning, oxytocin']"

Chronotype and Suicidal Ideation: Estimating the risk factors that contribute to suicidal ideation,"Kalampouka, Christina",['Oana Georgiana Rus Oswald'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Individual chronotype, i.e., being a morning or a night person, can influence psychological health in many ways, especially in people with an evening chronotype. Studies have shown a link between late chronotype and suicidal ideation, and have indicated depression as a potential mediator in this relationship. However, not many studies sufficiently controlled for (non) clinical confounding factors that could affect this association nor considered the potential mediative role of anxiety. This study aims to examine, first the association between chronotype and suicidal ideation after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and clinical risk factors related to suicidal ideation (insomnia, loneliness, negative life events, alcohol consumption). As a second aim, this study evaluates the potential mediative role of depression and anxiety symptomatology in this relationship. Methods: Data from a large longitudinal study, the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, were used (N=2,596), from two different follow-up points (FU2, FU3), which included 1,372 participants with at least one anxiety and/or depressive disorder, and healthy controls (N=1,224). Chronotype was assessed using the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) and suicidal ideation using Beck’s Scale of Suicidal Ideation (BSSI). To calculate the proposed aims, we conducted two logistic regression analyses using SPSS, and two mediation analyses using the PROCESS tool in SPSS. Results: Chronotype was associated with suicidal ideation (β=-0.29, p=0.006, OR=0.75), only after adjusting both for sociodemographic and clinical covariates. A considerable effect was attributed to employment (β=1.88, p<0.001, OR=6.61) and marital status (β=2.61, p<0.001, OR=13.51). The mediation analyses showed no indirect effects, neither for depression nor for anxiety, but further exploratory mediation analyses indicated that negative life events significantly mediated the relation between chronotype and suicidal ideation. Conclusion: Our study did not illustrate a strong association between chronotype and suicidal ideation, but showed a strong predicting value of employment and marital status and the need to assess negative life events when evaluating suicidal ideation.","['chronotype, suicidal ideation, risk factors, suicidality, depression, anxiety, night person, morning person, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder']"
Effectiveness of Sleep Interventions for Treating Suicidality Over the Lifespan: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"MacLellan, Anna","['Kivela, L.M.M']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Sleep disturbances and disorders have been linked with increased suicidality. Research is just beginning to explore using sleep interventions to reduce suicidality, but until now has not considered how sleep and suicidality change across the lifespan, and how that may impact the effectiveness of interventions. This study is the first meta-analysis examining whether sleep interventions are effective for reducing suicidality, and whether age has an impact on outcomes. A search was conducted on February 8th, 2022, using PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Article selection and data extraction was performed using the Covidence Systematic Review software. Twenty-one articles were included in this study. Sleep interventions were categorized as cognitive behavioural therapies (CBTs), circadian rhythm therapies (CRTs) and pharmacological therapies (PTs). Age groups were defined as adolescents (15-18), young adult college students (18-24), and adults (18-64). Sleep interventions overall had a small, significant effect size in reducing suicidality. CBTs and CRTs significantly reduced suicidality with small and medium effect sizes, but PTs did not. When stratified by age group, results found that sleep interventions overall significantly reduced suicidality in adolescents and adults with medium effect sizes, but there was no significant reduction in young adults. The results of this study suggest that sleep interventions may reduce suicidality and serve as a versatile and transdiagnostic treatment approach that deserves more focus. It also provides preliminary evidence that age may be a possible moderator for treatment effectiveness, and that future studies should include age as a moderator.","['suicide', 'sleep interventions', 'sleep problems', 'insomnia', 'life-span', 'treatment', 'age']"

Zelfverwondend gedrag bij mensen met een verstandelijke beperking: Een onderzoek naar de samenhang van zelfverwondend gedrag bij mensen met een verstandelijke beperking en kwaliteit van bestaan,"Commandeur, Sanne",['Yvette Dijkxhoorn'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Zelfverwondend gedrag is voor ouders, naasten en professionals een van de meest indringende vormen van probleemgedrag waar zij mee worden geconfronteerd. Het beperkt het individu in het dagelijks functioneren en mensen met een verstandelijke beperking ervaren vaak een lager kwaliteit van bestaan. In deze studie is onderzocht of er een samenhang is tussen kwaliteit van bestaan en zelfverwondend gedrag bij mensen met een verstandelijke beperking. Hierbij zijn risicofactoren, geslacht, intellectueel niveau, kwaliteit van bestaan en de handelingsverlegenheid van hulpverleners in kaart gebracht in relatie tot zelfverwondend gedrag. Dit onderzoek bestaat uit twee fasen: literatuuronderzoek en empirisch onderzoek. Uit het literatuuronderzoek is naar voren gekomen dat risicofactoren die van invloed zijn op zelfverwondend gedrag bij mensen met een verstandelijke beperking kunnen worden onderverdeeld in categorieën, namelijk: comorbiditeit, psychische-, somatische-, gedrags- en omgevingsfactoren. Mensen met een ernstige tot zeer ernstige verstandelijke beperking laten vaker zelfverwondend gedrag zien dan mensen met een lichte tot matige verstandelijke beperking. Binnen de literatuur werd geen duidelijk antwoord gevonden op de vraag of geslacht een bepalende factor is voor zelfverwondend gedrag bij mensen met een verstandelijke beperking. Uit de analyses kwamen geen significante resultaten naar voren, op één significant resultaat na namelijk: mensen met een verstandelijke beperking die zelfverwondend gedrag laten zien ervaren een lager kwaliteit van bestaan op het gebied van sociale inclusie. Een opvallende bevinding uit de analyses is dat hulpverleners aangeven dat de ondersteuning onvoldoende wordt afgestemd op de behoeften van de cliënt. Deze bevinding laat zien dat er binnen het onderzoeksveld meer gekeken moet worden naar wat hulpverleners nodig hebben om goede ondersteuning te kunnen bieden.",

Aantrekkelijkheid van zorgzame mannen: Onderzoek naar het effect van zorgcontext op beoordelingen van aantrekkelijkheid van mannen door vrouwen,"Panne, Eva van der","['Peter Bos', 'Shelley van der Veek']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Gebaseerd op de evolutionaire psychologie (Farrington, 1996; Barkow et al., 1995) en de Sexual Strategy Theory van Buss (1993) kiezen vrouwen hun partner uit op basis van het fysieke uiterlijk om zo de kans op een gezond nageslacht te verhogen. Deze theorieën focussen puur op aantrekkelijkheid als overlevingsmiddel, maar er bestaat natuurlijk meer dan alleen fysieke aantrekkelijkheid. Volgens het concept ‘cooperative breeding’ van Hrdy (2005) zijn er meerdere opvoeders nodig om nakomelingen succesvol groot te brengen. Vanuit deze benadering zou een zorgzame man voor vrouwen ook van belang kunnen zijn. Er bestaat echter nog weinig onderzoek naar of vrouwen deze eigenschap daadwerkelijk aantrekkelijk vinden in een man. Dit onderzoek draait dan ook om de vraag of vrouwen mannen binnen een zorgcontext aantrekkelijker vinden vergeleken met mannen binnen een neutrale context. Dit wordt onderzocht met een online vragenlijst waarin foto’s van mannen mét en zonder zorgcontext worden beoordeeld. Deze vragenlijst bestaat uit twee taken: een vignettaak en een fototaak. Er zijn dus twee stimuli gebruikt: foto’s van mannen mét of zonder kind, en neutrale foto’s van mannen in combinatie met een zorgvignet of een neutraal vignet. Voor de fototaak is een duidelijk hoofdeffect gevonden voor zorgcontext: vrouwen vonden mannen die positief interacteerden met een kind aantrekkelijker. Hiernaast bleken vrouwen met een kinderwens én jongere vrouwen gevoeliger te zijn voor deze zorgcontext. Zij vonden de mannen die positief interacteerden met kind aantrekkelijker dan vrouwen zonder kinderwens of relatief oudere participanten. Voor de vignettaak zijn geen effecten gevonden. Deze taak lijkt dus minder goed te werken om de relatie tussen zorgzaamheid en aantrekkelijkheid te meten. Een aanbeveling is dan ook om deze taak te verbeteren voor toekomstig onderzoek.",

Vascular reactivity as a possible independent marker of cognitive decline,"Grin, Esther","['Ruitenberg, M.F.L.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Vascular reactivity is defined as the ability of arteries to dilate or constrict as a reaction to changes in metabolite concentrations and is nowadays measured by the BOLD-response rather than with transcranial doppler ultrasound. Previous studies have shown that vascular reactivity is related to small vessel disease and cognition. However, it is unclear whether cognition remains associated with vascular reactivity when measured by the BOLD-response and whether these associations are (in)dependent of classic small vessel disease markers. Therefore, in this cross-sectional observational study we examined the associations between the BOLD-response and cognition and the (in)dependence of the significant associations from five classic small vessel disease markers. Our first hypothesis was that vascular reactivity is also associated with cognition when measured by the BOLD-response. Secondly, we hypothesized that the significant associations between vascular reactivity and cognition were dependent on microbleeds and perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale. The latter hypothesis was based on studies into cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a specific small vessel disease, that is associated with lower vascular reactivity, cognitive deterioration, and the presence of microbleeds and perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale. We determined vascular reactivity by measuring the peak time, baseline time, and amplitude of the BOLD-response in the occipital cortex after a visual stimulus. Composite z-scores for global cognitive functioning, memory, executive functioning, psychomotor speed, and language were calculated from cognitive tests obtained during a neuropsychological assessment. The five small vessel disease markers were assessed via MRI-scans. Results of bootstrapping analyses showed that only the BOLD-amplitude was associated with global cognitive functioning, memory, executive functioning, and language. These associations were mostly independent of small vessel diseases markers. Based on these findings, we suggest that vascular reactivity measured by the BOLD-amplitude might be an early relatively independent predictor of cognition decline, what might enable early detection and as a consequence early intervention. All in all, our findings underline the role of vascular aspects in cognition, although the causality of the associations is yet unclear and future research into the underlying processes of vascular reactivity and the BOLD-response is of great importance to further clarify our findings.","['Vascular reactivity', 'BOLD-response', 'cognition', 'small vessel disease']"

Specific attention was paid to LGBTQ students, a vulnerable minority group that has shown to be more susceptible to stress (Meyer, 2003). The study had a mixed methods design. A survey including standardized and self-composed questions was administered among a convenience sample of 974 university students (85% Caucasian; 79% identifying as woman), 214 of whom identified as LGBTQ. Quantitative analysis was done in SPSS, and open questions were assessed using thematic analysis in ATLAS.ti. According to the burnout measure short (BMS), 56% of the sample met the diagnostic criteria of burnout. Social support and stress were significant predictors of burnout; however, a mediating effect of social support was not found. Many students attributed the high levels of stress and burnout to a high workload. Students want universities to reduce workload, teach coping skills, and pay more personal attention to students’ mental health. LGBTQ students showed significantly higher levels of burnout and stress and lower levels of social support. Students indicated that their LGBTQ identity had them navigate additional stressors, and they asked for LGBTQ-specific support from within their universities. The current study shows that burnout is a serious problem among students. Social support may play a small role in burnout; burnout prevention should mainly focus on reducing stress while considering the needs of students. Using firsthand input from the survey, this study presents two frameworks linking student needs to existing and new interventions.","['student', 'burnout', 'student burnout', 'social support', 'LGBTQ', 'LGBTQ students', 'LGBTQ community', 'LGBT', 'minority', 'minority group', 'mixed methods', 'stress']"
Verbal transmission of social fear beliefs from parents to children: a moderation by parental social anxiety?,"Verdoes, Lara","['Aktar, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social anxiety runs in families. A pathway that plays a significant role in the transmission of social anxiety from parent-to-child, is the verbal information pathway. Studies that investigated this pathway mainly focused on the fear of novel animals instead of social fears. The current study investigated how parental verbal threat versus safety information affects the fear beliefs of children about strangers in social situations. Additionally, in the light of earlier research suggesting an influence of parental social anxiety on the effect of verbal information, parental social anxiety has been explored as a moderator. Primary caregivers provided their child (N = 69, M = 11.67 years, 59.4% girls) with either verbal threat or safety information regarding two strangers. After receiving the verbal information, the child had to perform three social tasks, twice, in front of each stranger. After the social tasks, the child had to report his level of fear (fear beliefs) regarding the strangers. Parents reported their own levels of social anxiety through a questionnaire. The findings showed that children reported more fear for the stranger paired with parental verbal threat information compared to the stranger paired with parental verbal safety information. However, no moderation of parental social anxiety on the effect of verbal information was found. Conclusively, the study reveals a causal effect of parental verbal threat on children’s fear beliefs. Possible explanations for the lack of a moderating effect of parental social anxiety and the need for future research are discussed.","['Child social anxiety', 'Parents', 'Verbal information pathway', 'Strangers', 'Fear beliefs']"
"Parental Psychological Control as Predictor for Child Trait Anxiety, Moderated by Child Emotional Maltreatment and Gender","Nijp, Channah",['Wilma Wentholt'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous research suggests that higher levels of trait anxiety in adolescents, especially for girls, are a risk of developing one or more anxiety disorders in the future. Furthermore, multiple studies show that certain dysfunctional behaviors of parents such as parental psychological control (PC) and child emotional maltreatment (CEM) seem to be related to anxiety symptoms in adolescents. Therefore, this study aimed to examine risk factors related to trait anxiety, more specifically we examined the role of parental PC, and the potential moderating role of child gender and CEM. A multi-method (i.e., questionnaires, observations), cross-sectional design is used with a sample of 78 adolescents aged between 11 and 17 years, and their parent(s). Two different adolescent-report questionnaires were used to measure trait anxiety and CEM. Parental PC is measured during observations. The hierarchical regression model showed that there is no significant relation between parental PC and adolescent trait anxiety. Furthermore, there was no moderation effect found for both adolescent gender and CEM. In conclusion, this study is one of the first studies that used observational methods to measure parental PC, and which also included fathers as participants. In contrast, the results of this study are not consistent with findings in previous research. A possible explanation for this could be the difference in sample size, method, and the use of a healthy control group. Future research could focus on a combination of observational methods and self-report questionnaires to get a whole view of parental PC.","['trait anxiety, parental psychological control (PC), gender, adolescence, child emotional maltreatment (CEM)']"
"The Parent-to-Child Transmission of Social Fear Beliefs via Verbal Information, Considering the Moderating Role of Child Social Anxiety","Rethmeier, Lucia",['Evin Aktar'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Research has shown that exposure to verbal threat (versus verbal safety) information induced children’s fear beliefs regarding novel animals. The parent-to-child transmission of verbal information pathways to social fear acquisitions have not been studied before. A limited number of studies that focused on the verbal transmission of anxiety explored individual differences explained by child characteristics, such as child social anxiety. The current study examined the influence of verbal threat versus safety information on children’s fear beliefs and explored the moderating role of child social anxiety on this relationship. Parents and children reported children’s trait social anxiety. Children were exposed to standardized verbal threat and verbal safety information, given by their parents, regarding two strangers in the laboratory. After meeting the two strangers in three social tasks, children reported their fear beliefs regarding the two strangers. Children reported higher fear beliefs when they were exposed to verbal threat information versus when they were exposed to verbal safety information. Child social anxiety did not significantly influence this effect. Based on the findings of the current study, we conclude that the influence of verbal threat information on fear beliefs is not limited to specific animal phobias, but extends to social fears. Further research is needed to further elucidate the causal role of verbal threat information in the acquisition of social fear.",
"The interplay between negative expectancies, nocebo hyperalgesia, avoidance behavior, and pain","Harteveld, Tirza","['Nadinda, P. G.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Nocebo hyperalgesia can be defined as an increased sensitivity to pain caused by a nocebo effect. Expectancies are fundamental to nocebo effects. How pain is experienced can be modified by expectancies and avoidance behavior. This is the basis of the fear-avoidance model. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the relationship between pain, expectancies and avoidance behavior. More specifically, we wanted to assess whether negative expectancies induce nocebo hyperalgesia, and whether nocebo hyperalgesia predicts avoidance. A total of 116 participants were included in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to either the control (n = 58) or nocebo group (n = 58). The pain stimuli were administered electrically. In the nocebo group, expectancies about pain stimuli were induced by verbal suggestions and conditioning. The verbal suggestions included telling participants that a specific color cue would increase the intensity. The conditioning consisted of consistently pairing a specific color cue with a higher stimulus. In the control group, no expectancies were induced and stimuli were administered randomly. Avoidance was measured through a pain avoidance task for which the Tower of Hanoi was used. Results indicated a significant interaction between type of color cue and group (F(1,114) = 34.08, p < .001, ηp2 = .230), indicating a significant difference between the pain ratings of the color cues of both groups. Participants in the nocebo group gave higher pain ratings than the control group, indicating that nocebo hyperalgesia increased when negative expectancies were induced. However, nocebo hyperalgesia did not predict avoidance behavior (χ² (1) = .51, p = .477). The results are in line with studies on nocebo effects on pain and add to the importance of verbal suggestions. As pain can be hugely modified by expectancies, it is recommended for clinicians to be mindful of their communication with patients. By effectively managing patients’ expectancies, nocebo effects can be minimized. Results do not completely corroborate the fear-avoidance model. Therefore, future research should focus on developing objective measurement instruments of avoidance. This could provide more insight into the development of pain and improve pain treatments.","['nocebo hyperalgesia', 'pain', 'expectancies', 'avoidance']"

Furthermore, this study also aimed to examine whether moral identity had a direct effect on purchase intention. A survey was conducted, with a total of 114 participants. There was no significant relationship found between perceived misfit between homosexuality and job and purchase intention, and moral identity did not moderate this relationship. However, moral identity was positively related to purchase intention. These initial findings suggest that there is a no stereotype of a perceived misfit affecting purchase intention.

Metaplasticity in (Ex-)Musicians: The Relation Between Degree of Musical Training and Rate of Motoric Learning,"Graaff, Vivian de","['Schaefer, R.S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Musical training has been shown to be beneficial for advanced motor skill development, inducing plasticity in the brain. Yet, little research has been done on metaplasticity in musicians, referring to synaptic stimulation allowing for faster and more stable learning later in life in the same domain. Intense exposure, training for a prolonged period, and training onset at younger age induces more plasticity. This study addressed whether these effects extend to metaplasticity by investigating the influence of three musical parameters – years of musical training, practice intensity and onset age of musical training – for varying levels of musical experience on motoric learning later in life (age 50 and up). This is done with an observational study in which 16 participants from non-musicians to professional musicians were examined. During the session, they completed a computerized pursuit-rotor task with a 180 degrees inverted mouse four times spread out over the session. In between we surveyed training intensity, duration and age of onset, among other things. Multiple regression data analysis showed no significant effects of the musical parameters on the rate of motoric learning taken over the whole learning course. Based on the obtained data, training effects on plasticity do not extend to metaplasticity. Conclusions should be made with caution, because of a small sample size and unequal distribution of participants along the scope of musical experience. Advancing our understanding of metaplastic processes can guide decision making in rehabilitation when estimating learning potential, considering motivation, and forming a treatment plan. More research could be done with different motoric tasks and on metaplasticity in other movement practices (e.g. dancing, athletics, gaming).",
Thesis,"Giannou, Maria-Anna","['Chen, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background and objectives: It has long been stated that a prominent feature of social anxiety is gaze avoidance, and while a large body of literature has studied face gaze behavior in individuals with social anxiety traits, eye gaze has not gained enough attention. Eye gaze has also been shown to be suggestible to conversational phases and more specifically, it is decreased while speaking. Furthermore, research to date is lacking in naturalistic experiments with live interactions. The present study investigated the effects of social anxiety on eye gaze behavior while also taking into consideration the conversational role as a modulating factor during a face-to-face, dyadic interaction. Methods: Fifty-five female participants (M = 20.60 years, SD = 2.24) were recruited for this study. Their level of anxiety was measured using the Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and according to their scores, they were assigned to two groups (high /low socially anxious). Participants engaged in a turn-taking, getting acquainted conversation with a female confederate, while their eye movements were being tracked using Tobii eye-tracking glasses. Three eye gaze measures were extracted and studied: proportion of fixations, total fixation duration and mean fixation duration. Results: The results showed a significant relation between reduced eye gaze and high levels of social anxiety on the proportion of fixations and total fixation duration. Decreased eye gaze was also observed during the speaking phase, regardless of social anxiety levels on all three measures of eye gaze. Contrary to our last hypothesis, no significant interaction effects were found when taking both social anxiety and conversational role into account. Conclusion: The current findings stress the importance of tackling safety-seeking behaviors when treating individuals that are at risk of Social Anxiety Disorder for more successful social interactions. More research that will study eye gaze in particular during real-life social interactions is needed, as the relevant literature is scarce. Limitations of the current study as well as suggestions for future work are discussed.","['Eye gaze, social anxiety, conversational role, face-to-face interaction, safety-seeking behavior, eye-tracking']"
Selectief mutisme bij adolescenten en de toepassing van copingstrategieën,"Roos, Isa","['Bondt, M. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Selective Mutism (SM) is a rare anxiety disorder characterized by consistently not speaking in (social) situations, in which speaking is required. Little research has been done on SM. Literature suggests that adolescents with social anxiety disorder (SA), which SM has many similarities with, apply more maladaptive coping strategies and less adaptive coping strategies, than adolescents without SA. In addition, boys seem to apply more maladaptive coping strategies than girls. However, there are no studies yet that confirm this for SM. The current study therefore aimed to investigate whether different coping strategies are used between adolescents with and without SM and what the role of gender is in this. In the study 79 adolescents participated with their parents, including 34 adolescents with SM and 45 adolescents without SM. The self-report questionnaire FEEL-KJ (Fragebogen zur Erhebung der Emotionsregulation bei Kindern und Jugendlichen) was used to identify the coping strategies used by adolescents. The study revealed that adolescents with SM used significantly more maladaptive coping strategies and less adaptive coping strategies than adolescents with SA. No significant difference was found in the use of external regulation strategies between adolescents with and without SM. There was no significant difference found in the use of coping strategies between boys and girls either. Also, no interaction was found between gender and SM in relation to coping strategies. The results provide a first indication of the coping strategies used in adolescents with SM, however, follow-up research should be conducted to confirm or disconfirm these results. Subsequently, this knowledge can be used in the treatment of SM.","['Selectief mutisme', 'copingstratgieën', 'adaptief', 'maladaptief', 'externe regulatie', 'geslacht', 'interactie']"
Association Between Early Life Adversity and Punishment Sensitivity in a Healthy Sample,"Hu, Qiaochu","['Topel, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Individuals who have a history of early life adversity in their childhood often show impairments in a broad range of cognitive functioning and behavioral adaptation. This deficit could potentially be due to the impairment in associative learning. To explore this possibility, this paper examined whether early life adversity affects people’s punishment sensitivity, an essential part of associative learning, using a healthy sample. In total, 188 participants completed a volatile probabilistic learning task online that required them to learn from the feedback, update the association as well as adjust their behaviors in different social conditions (social vs. non-social) and block types (stable vs. volatile). This paper that early life adversity is related to a more total game loss, but not related to the percentages of choosing the stimulus with a lower probability of loss. Participants show a positive bias in general while addressing the effect of early life adversity. Furthermore, this paper found that participants with higher early life adversity may show reduced punishment sensitivity, but only when they think they are interacting and learning about other people. No such interaction association was observed between early life adversity, feedback shown, and block types. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that early life adversity might influence people’s punishment sensitivity in the social context. It provides insight for further research regarding basic learning mechanisms.","['Early life adversity', 'childhood maltreatment', 'punishment sensitivity', 'associative learning', 'decision making']"

It is often accompanied by fear of negative evaluation and instable self-esteem. This study used a SELF- speech task and looked at the discrepancy trait of perfectionism specifically to examine how individuals with this trait update their feelings about the self, with the expectation that they would show a negativity bias. Additionally, it was hypothesized that these individuals would show differences in brain activity (mid-frontal theta oscillations) caused by negative feedback. Ninety-five participants, out of which fifty-two were in the high discrepancy group, gave a speech about themselves and received positive and negative feedback about their performance. Results of this study show that individuals learn differently from negative and positive feedback. More specifically, both groups showed a positivity bias indicating that they update their feelings about the self more after receiving positive than negative feedback. Differently than expected, the high discrepancy group did not show negativity bias and had learning rates similar to the low discrepancy group. This study also found that theta power activity was not correlated to the mismatch or valence of the feedback received after the task. Furthermore, no group differences in theta power activity were found. These findings indicate that the discrepancy between one’s expectations and self-perception is not related to a negativity bias or increased mid-frontal theta power oscillations. Future research should focus on other classifications of perfectionism to confirm these findings.","['Discrepancy, learning bias, negative feedback, perfectionism, theta power']"

The Effect of the X Chromosome Imbalance on Sex Differences in Brain Variability and Autism Risk,"Rijn, Lotte van",['L. Wierenga'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable disorder that is more prevalent in males than females. Genetic mechanisms of the sexual differentiation could therefore contribute to the sex differences in ASD. An unexplored pathway lies in the potential contribution of the direct effect of the X chromosome imbalance. Due to the X chromosome’s implications in brain structure, the imbalance in X chromosomes could contribute to recently discovered sex differences in brain structure variance. As males showed larger brain structure variance, they have generally larger brain structure deviations compared to females. If increasing brain structure deviations relate to increased ASD risk, this mechanism could explain why males show higher ASD prevalence compared to females. To assess an influence of the X chromosome imbalance on sex differences in brain structure variance, we assessed the sex difference in brain structure variance in brain regions with a high and low expression of the X chromosome. We then assessed whether larger brain structure deviations related to increased ASD symptoms. This was examined in a population of typically developing individuals aged 7 to 14. The X chromosome expression did not affect sex differences in brain structure variance. Therefore, our results did not support an effect of the X chromosome imbalance on sex differences in brain structure variance. Additionally, brain deviation showed no relationship with ASD symptoms. Our results do not support a contribution of sex differences in brain structure variance to sex differences in ASD. Our findings could suggest potential influences of other downstream effects of the chromosomal imbalance and the high heterogeneity of ASD.",

Using a cross-sectional design, this study drew from a representative sample of the Dutch population (the reference sample, N = 1137) and a clinical sample (N = 378) of outpatients with a primary diagnosis of a personality disorder. The reference sample filled out the questionnaire online, and the clinical sample as part of their routine outcome monitoring. Gender and age were investigated as influential factors on raw scores, and clinical patients were expected to score higher than the reference sample. Results showed a main effect on raw scores for gender, a non-linear effect for age, and an interaction effect for gender and age. The clinical sample showed more structural impairment than the reference sample. Norming was done with a semi-parametric continuous norming method using Taylor polynomials. The method was a slightly altered version of the approach presented in cNORM to provide functions determining exact T scores for individual patients. The altered norming method generated slightly less fitting models than the original method. Next to the functions, T-scaled norm scores based on gender and age are provided in crosswalk tables. Future research must investigate age effects in structural impairment in longitudinal studies and whether, in practice, there is a meaningful difference in generated T scores between the altered and original norming methods.","['standardization, Inventory of Personality Organization, personality disorder, continuous norming, cNORM']"

This can make social participation for children with ASD unpleasant and stressful, even though social participation is vital for their development (Eisenberg et al., 1998; Kawachi & Berkman, 2001). To date, only a few studies have examined the impact of limited access to school participation on the psychosocial development of school-aged children with ASD. Furthermore, one may wonder whether certain factors, e.g., individual, family, or school factors, could influence the relation between social participation and psychosocial functioning in children with ASD. To address this gap of knowledge, this study examined the relation between social participation and psychosocial functioning of Dutch children with ASD aged between 4 and 16 years. Furthermore, this study explored whether and to what extent children’s individual characteristics such as IQ, their family characteristics such as parent self-efficacy, and the school characteristics, such as the social environment of the school, could moderate this relation. Two hundred parents of children with ASD from different areas of the Netherlands filled in questionnaires to report about their children’s socioemotional development through the online platform NAR (Dutch Autism Register). The results showed that the more children with ASD participated in social interactions, the fewer psychosocial problems they had. Higher parent self-efficacy predicted fewer psychosocial problems in children with ASD. However, no moderating effects were found. The current study highlights the importance of promoting social participation at school for children with ASD. It also highlights the importance of providing support to the parents of children with ASD and increasing these parents’ self-confidence in supporting their child with ASD.","['Social participation', 'ASD', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'children', 'psychosocial functioning', 'IQ', 'parent self-efficacy', 'school social environment']"
The Role of Empathy and Alexithymia in Moral Reasoning of Psychopaths,"Hoek, Mellan","['Rijnders, R.', 'Cuperus, A. A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by affective, interpersonal, and behavioural problems. The current study aims to examine the role of psychopaths’ emotional deficiencies in their moral reasoning. We hypothesized that psychopathy severity predicts utilitarian decisions (1), empathy (2), and alexithymia (3) and that the relationship between psychopathy severity and utilitarian decision-making is mediated by empathy (4) and alexithymia (5). A total of 20 PCL-R confirmed psychopaths psychiatric inpatients were recruited from five different psychiatric hospitals in the Netherlands. Empathy and alexithymia were measured using the IRI and TAS-20 questionnaires. Each participant was shown 12 fictional moral dilemmas to which a utilitarian (greater good-sacrificial) or deontological (harm-avoiding) action had to be chosen. Contrary to expectations (1), results showed that psychopathy severity was negatively related to utilitarian decision-making (β = -.49, p = .030), with higher PCL-R scores reflecting lower percentages of utilitarian decisions on moral dilemmas. All other hypotheses were not supported, as psychopathy severity was not related to any empathy subscale (2) β ranging from <∣.01∣ to ∣.35∣, p > .05) or alexithymia subscale (3) (β ranging from ∣.16∣ to ∣.30∣, p > .05), and no mediation effects were found for either empathy (4) (β ranging from <∣.01∣ to ∣.23∣, BCIs contain 0) or alexithymia (5) (β ranging from ∣.01∣ to ∣.04∣, BCIs contain 0). A possible explanation for the contradictory finding that higher scoring psychopaths make fewer utilitarian decisions is the study setting. Despite the study data being used solely for academic purposes, participants might feel a need to ‘’fake good’’ to nonetheless avoid any negative evaluations that might affect their sentence. Furthermore, the inability to detect any mediative effects might be due to the current studies limited sample size. This made it unfeasible for analyses to differentiate the variables psychopathy and moral reasoning into potentially meaningful subcategories. Future studies should examine how these subcategories relate to moral decision-making. Additionally, it is recommended to make further efforts to minimize the perceived need to fake good, to further investigate the counterintuitive finding that higher scoring psychopaths display more harm-avoiding moral reasoning than lower scoring psychopaths.","['Empathy', 'Psychopathy', 'Alexithymia', 'Moral']"
Hoeveel kinderen ken jij? Onderzoek naar de betrouwbaarheid van netwerk vragenlijsten,"Ruitenbeek, Iris","['Berkel, S. R. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"In 2017 heeft de derde editie van de Nationale Prevalentiestudie Mishandeling van kinderen en jeugdigen (NPM-2017) plaatsgevonden om een schatting te kunnen maken van het aantal kinderen dat per jaar slachtoffer is van kindermishandeling. Binnen de NPM-2017 is een pilot uitgevoerd waarbij ook niet-professionals werden gevraagd om hun vermoedens van kindermishandeling te rapporteren, zodat een betere schatting zou kunnen worden gemaakt van de prevalentie van de kindermishandeling in Nederland. Het totaal aantal kinderen dat iemand professioneel kent is vrij eenvoudig te bepalen, maar hoeveel kinderen iemand informeel kent is een stuk lastiger. In dit onderzoek wordt gekeken of een netwerk-vragenlijst een betrouwbare methode is om te bepalen hoeveel kinderen iemand kent. Dit is nog niet eerder gedaan, terwijl dit voor onderzoeken zoals de NPM wel van meerwaarde kan zijn. In totaal hebben 54 participanten een van de twee versies van de netwerk-vragenlijst van 23 vragen (8 naam-vragen, 11 kenmerk-vragen, 3 leeftijd-vragen en de algemene vraag ‘Hoeveel kinderen ken jij in totaal?’) ingevuld. Om antwoord te krijgen op de onderzoeksvragen zijn meerdere gepaarde en ongepaarde t-toetsen en een multipele regressie uitgevoerd. Bij beide versies van de vragenlijst was te zien dat de participanten op basis van de vragenlijst meer kinderen lijken te kennen dan dat zij zelf inschatten op basis van de algemene vraag. Er was te zien dat de gemiddelden per items van elkaar verschillen en dat bij sommige items de antwoorden van de participanten verder uit elkaar liggen dan bij andere vragen. Opvallend bij de resultaten is dat mensen eerder geneigd lijken zijn te onderschatten dan te overschatten. Geconcludeerd kan worden dat deze netwerk nog onvoldoende betrouwbaar en valide is om te bepalen hoeveel kinderen iemand kent. Er is meer onderzoek nodig om een dergelijke vragenlijst in te kunnen zetten bij een studie als de Nationale Prevalentiestudie Mishandeling van kinderen en jeugdigen (NPM). Wel zijn er een aantal aanknopingspunten uitgekomen die nuttig zijn voor een vervolgonderzoek.",

In this study participated 175 first time mothers who were followed over the period from around week 27 of the pregnancy until the child was 42 months old. There were five moments of measurement which included house visits and research days at the university. In this research there were found several significant outcomes. There were three independent t-tests executed. They showed a significant effect for externalizing behavior of the child when the mother had smoked prenatally and for externalizing behavior of the child when the mother experiences parenting stress. There was no significant effect found for parenting stress when the mother had smoked prenatally. The outcomes of the executed two-way ANOVA also supported these results. The results of the two-way ANOVA showed that there is no interaction-effect which means there is no significant difference in the effect of parentings tress on externalizing behavior for smoking prenatally. Finally, a Pearson r correlation was executed to examine the relation between the quantity of prenatal smoked cigarettes and parenting stress and between externalizing behavior of the child.

Het verschil in effectiviteit tussen leren middels directe instructie en voorspellen bij kinderen en volwassenen,"Pel, Maartje","['Jolles, D. D.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Passive and active learning strategies are well-known strategies which effectiveness has been analyzed for many years. The main purpose of this study is to examine age-related differences in the effectiveness of a passive learning strategy (direct instruction) and an active learning strategy (generating predictions). Participants in this study were 66 children aged 10-13 and 45 young adults aged 18-26 who performed a numerical facts learning task. This study used a between-subjects design containing a prediction condition where participants had to generate a prediction before seeing the correct answer and a repetition condition where participants had to repeat the correct answer in order to learn the numerical facts. This study has found a significant age x learning strategy interaction effect, with children remembering more facts after generating predictions rather than repeating, whereas the strategies were similarly effective for young adults. Another significant learning effect was found for the distance from the prediction to the correct answer. Both children and young adults remembered more facts that were predicted correctly or facts that were predicted poorly (with a distance of three to eight), compared to facts that were predicted almost correctly (with a distance of one or two). This provides evidence for the surprise-effect as an underlying working mechanism in learning based on generating predictions because the distance of a prediction to the correct answer is an indicator for the degree of experienced surprise. Furthermore, this study has found wrong predictions more likely to be corrected instead of repeated for both children and young adults. This provides evidence for the effectiveness of learning based on generating predictions. These findings suggest that there are differences in effectiveness among learning strategies for different ages, with generating predictions as an effective strategy for children of 10-13 years.","['generatieve leerstrategieën', 'leerstrategie', 'directe instructie', 'voorspellen', 'herhalen', 'numerieke feitjes', 'kinderen', 'jongvolwassenen']"
The Cost of Hedonism: The interaction of Trait Hedonic Capacity and financial stress on enjoyment at different price points.,"Kraan, Steven van der","['Vliek, Michael']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"We aimed to build an understanding of how people’s capacity to enjoy themselves (Trait Hedonic Capacity), financial stress, and the price of a hedonic event interact, and how they impact the amount of enjoyment people gain from the hedonic activity. Our hypotheses stated that we expected financially stressed people to enjoy expensive hedonic activities less, unless they were inherently more able to enjoy themselves. Our data was collected by way of a convenience sample who filled in an online questionnaire (N = 129). The main analysis of this data was done by way of a mixed model repeated measures ANOVA with two groups (high- vs. low-cost condition) and two continuous between subject factors (Trait Hedonic Capacity and Financial Stress). Our analysis found no direct relation between financial stress and difference between enjoyment in more or less expensive hedonic events. We did find a significant effect for Trait Hedonic Capacity on enjoyment. Participants that scored higher on Trait Hedonic Capacity were far less affected by the increase in price of the hedonic activity, and enjoyed the high-cost hedonic event more than participants that scored lower on Trait Hedonic Capacity. We further explore how intrusive thoughts and rumination link the constructs of Trait Hedonic Capacity and financial stress, and argue that people higher in Trait Hedonic Capacity are especially better at pursuing hedonic goals when there are obstacles to hedonic success. That is when individual differences in Trait Hedonic Capacity shine through.","['Financial stress', 'Trait Hedonic Capacity', 'Hedonism', 'Price']"

An investigation into the differences in exposure time to watching eye-cues on prosocial behaviour.","Schutzbach, Beatrice","['Olvido Perea-García, Juan']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Watching eye cues has been argued to enhance altruistic behavior in humans through reputational mechanisms. However, subsequent replication attempts have failed at reproducing the results on increasing prosocial behavior. Procedural differences (namely exposure time) in previous studies could hold the answer of the contradicting findings. Some authors suggest that the longer participants have to process eye-like stimuli, the less prosocial behavior they exhibit. In this online between-subject design, we exposed participants to either short (16ms) or long exposure time (60s) to eye-cues or no exposure to eye-cues. We measured the amount donated by participants from their monetary compensation to an environmental NGO, to measure the effect on prosocial behavior through donations. Our hypothesis was in two-fold: first, we wanted to replicate the findings of prosocial behavior when exposed to eye-like stimuli. Second, that subliminal exposure to eye-like stimuli would enhance donation behavior more than a longer exposure time to the stimuli would. Through binary logistic regressions, we found that exposing participants to eye-cues did not increase donations, nor did subliminal exposure compared to longer exposure. These results has both practical implications for using eye-cues online and theoretical implications for the reputational mechanisms’ theory. Future research should consider using eye-tracking for validation of the short exposure.","['Watching eye-cues', 'reputational management theory', 'exposure time', 'prosocial behaviour', 'unconscious processing']"

Impulsivity in eating disorders: the role of the two subtypes of eating disorders and the possible link with vitamin D,"Leeuwen, Bowie van",['Anne Cuperus'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"There is growing evidence that impulsivity plays an important role in Eating Disorders (EDs), as it can negatively affect the illness’ development and the treatment success. The aim of this study is to examine whether there are differences in impulsivity between restricting subtype EDs, binge-eating/purging subtype EDs, and healthy controls using a neuropsychological assessment tool. It has been hypothesized that patients with a restricting ED had the lowest degree of impulsivity and patients with a binge-eating/purging ED the highest. Additionally, it was investigated if there is a correlation between the degree of impulsivity and the level of vitamin D in patients with an ED, whereby a negative correlation was expected. This study has a cross-sectional design with an observational nature. A total of 183 patients with an ED has participated in this study: 54 were patients with a restricting ED and 129 patients with a binge-eating/purging ED. The control group consisted of 45 participants. The sample size for the vitamin D analysis consisted out of 144 participants. The degree of impulsivity was determined by the Go/No-Go Task and the vitamin D level was determined by an analysis of a blood sample. To investigate the first hypothesis a MANOVA was performed. The second hypothesis was tested with the Pearson correlation coefficient. The MANOVA showed there was no significant effect of the group type on the degree of impulsivity, Λ = 0.967, p = 0.108. The Pearson correlations revealed a non-significant relation between a person's vitamin D level and the number of commission errors, r = 0.72, p = 0.172 or the vitamin D level and total reaction time, r = -0.05, p = 0.531. In conclusion, it would appear that there is no difference in the degree of impulsivity between the binge-eating/purging subtype, the restricting subtype, and the control group, and there is no relationship between a person's vitamin D level and impulsivity. It is critical that future studies using a combination of self-reports and neuropsychological assessment tasks examine the impact of ED subtypes on impulsivity. By investigating the possible function of vitamin D supplementation, novel treatment interventions that can target impulsivity from a clinical and physiological approach may be developed.","['Eating Disorders', 'subtypes of eating disorders', 'impulsivity', 'vitamin d', 'Go/No-Go Task']"
Whose Big Brother is watching? The influence of horizontal and vertical data breaches on the willingness to disclose identifying information online,"Smulders, Romano","['Steinel, W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Privacy is a hotly debated topic. Many claim that their privacy is of great importance to them, yet at the same time people are prone to self-disclose a lot of information online. This privacy paradox is at the centre of a lot of scholarly debate. By expanding on the horizontal/vertical privacy model by Quinn and Epstein (2018, July), this thesis aims to better understand the privacy paradox. Horizontal privacy pertains to sharing information in the peer domain. Vertical privacy pertains to sharing information in the government/corporation domain. Using a fictious social networking site, self-report measures were taken that predict behaviour. 165 (71 male; 94 female) Participants were led to believe that their data was breached and leaked either in the horizontal or vertical domain or not at all. It was hypothesized that data breaches, and the horizontal data breach in particular, would create negative experiences that would lead to discontinuing the fictitious SNS. The results of this thesis remain inconclusive. No significant differences between the horizontal, vertical data breaches and control condition were found. Although the data do not support the research hypotheses, the present study does give some insights in how to improve future research. What is more, it makes a case for the horizontal/vertical privacy model, since it nevertheless can be of use to both scholars and society.","['horizontal, vertical, privacy, paradox, data']"

Socioeconomic competition and horizontal inequalities (HIs) play a fundamental role in fomenting grievances between ethnic groups (Cederman et al., 2011). Through the use of theory-testing process tracing, this thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of the role socioeconomic HIs play in the emergence, progression and outcome of SoS conflict. This paper will show how in the case of Myanmar, the politicisation of HIs, precipitants, ethnic riots, rumours, state involvement and pogroms underpin the evolution of the June and October 2012 communal conflict between the Muslim Rohingya and Rakhine Buddhists culminating in the pogroms of August 2017. The paper will perform a qualitative assessment of state policies, human rights reports and media publications to map the politicisation of HIs and the subsequent onset of communal conflict. It concludes that longstanding socioeconomic competition between ethnic groups in the background, amplified by the politicisation of socioeconomic and demographic HIs in the foreground is fundamental to the onset of SoS conflict.","['SoS conflict', 'socioeconomic competition', 'horizontal inequalities', 'politicisation', 'Myanmar']"
"When you try Your Best, but you Don’t Succeed: Choice Architect Influence in Retirement Saving Decisions","Kurtenbach, Nicolas",['Wilco van Dijk'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Saving for retirement is a difficult task and individuals need to overcome many hurdles to succeed in it. When governments and companies try to help individuals, they will need to engage in choice architecture, which means that they will exert some influence on the individuals’ decisions. Therefore, they might be held responsible for the outcomes of the individuals’ savings decisions. Evidence from two online experiments on Prolific (N = 1142) indicates that choice architecture which does not reach the desired outcome can result in a loss of trustworthiness. Further, this loss of trustworthiness depended on the exact choice architecture used. When the choice architecture did not reach the desired outcome, an individual who was presented with a suggestion perceived the trustworthiness of the CA as lower than an individual who was presented a simple free choice. Interestingly, using defaults seems to have no adverse impacts on perceived trustworthiness when the desired outcome was not reached. Finally, we discuss implications for policy and research.","['retirment saving', 'behavioral economics', 'decision making psychology']"

Is Loss Aversion a Drive for Intergroup Conflict? An Experimental Study,"Konidi, Christina","['Plisnkin, R.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Loss aversion has been widely investigated as a factor influencing decision-making and conflict. I proposed that conflicts in groups are most likely to occur when maximizing ingroup benefit involves harming the outgroup and both parties believe they would suffer losses if they did not compete, losses that loom larger than equivalent gains due to loss aversion. This study examined whether high levels of loss aversion are indeed a potential drive for intergroup conflict. Participants consisted of 126 individuals. The study operationalized the Intergroup Prisoner’s Dilemma—Maximizing Difference (IPD-MD) game, which investigates the motivational processes that lead to intergroup conflict. There were two main hypotheses in the present study: first, even though people avoid benefiting the ingroup while deliberately harming the outgroup, I hypothesized that they will do so when it is more efficient for their group, and, second, that high scores in loss aversion will be associated with more investments in the between-group pool (intergroup conflict). The findings strongly supported my first hypothesis, as, indeed, participants decided to invest more in the between-group pool compared to the within-group pool when the former was more efficient. The results for the second hypothesis did not reach significance in our sample. Nonetheless, future research is encouraged with a larger sample size and with added moderators to the model, such as age.","['intergroup conflict', 'loss aversion', 'economic games', 'IPD-MD']"

In the Shadow of a Cyberattack: The Impact of Digital Attacks on Interstate Tensions,"Costello, Katharine","['Haer, R. van der', 'Masullo, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Although scholars have studied the aftermath of interstate cyberattacks, there has been little research on how states use non-violent measures to react to these digital attacks. Instead, research has focussed on how cyberattacks are unlikely to trigger a physically violent, interstate response, missing how these new weapons can worsen interstate relations in non-violent ways. To address this gap, I pose the question, do cyberattacks lead to a decline in interstate relations, while still avoiding physical conflict? States are incentivised to deter future attacks by responding to the incursion while avoiding costly, physical confrontation. However, the intensity of this response is likely to be influenced by their relationship with their attacker. Attacks launched by rivals can appear more threatening due to their history of conflict and therefore warrant more aggressive, non-violent responses. I therefore investigate whether cyberattacks lead to an increase in an attacked state’s defence budget and a reduction in diplomatic relations. While some support is found for states using these non-violent measures as a response to cyberattacks, the presence of a rivalry did not lead to the expected outcomes, due to weaknesses with the operationalisation of my variables. Nevertheless, my thesis indicates non-violent, negative measures are used in response to a cyberattack and therefore the impact of cyberweapons in damaging interstate relations should not be underestimated.","['cyberattacks', 'interstate war', 'cyberwar', 'interstate relations']"

Peer group supervision can be a transparent alternative to personal therapy to support the development of therapeutic competencies.

The data from these participants was used in mixed model analyses to investigate the relations of time, between the first and final sessions, professional self-doubt, as scored on the Professional Self-Doubt scale (PSD), and therapeutic competencies scored on the ‘voormeting therapeutfactoren’ from the VGCt, with ratings of the peer group supervision sessions on the GSRS. Age and time as a member were included as covariates, gender was not, because all participants were female. Analyses were also run to look into a possible increase in PSD due to the sessions. The results did not support the hypotheses that PSD or therapeutic competencies pretest scores predicted higher ratings on the GSRS (b = -2.30(2.24); b = -.29(1.86)). PSD did make a significant difference in the deviance explained (F(4, 5) = 4.43, p < .05). The analysis showed a positive effect of time on the ratings (b = 2.76(4.30)). PSD scores appeared to decrease over the course of the sessions (b = -0.39 (0,16)). Unfortunately, there was a lack of data, and no significant results were found.

Extending Clusterwise ICA (C-ICA to distinguish between common and distinctive components,"Scholte, Roy","['Wilderjans, T.F.', 'Durieux, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"A challenge in clinical neuroscience is to identify systematic differences between patients’ resting state networks (RSNs) that may relate to phenotypes and/or disease subtypes. Recently, Durieux et al. (2022) proposed a novel unsupervised learning method for multi-subject rs-fMRI data, called Clusterwise Independent Component Analysis (C-ICA), which enables automatic clustering of subjects based on differences and similarities in subjects’ RSNs. A drawback of C-ICA, however, is that the method assumes that subject clusters show large difference in the RSNs that characterizes them. This, however, is a quite restrictive assumption as it can be expected that there exists important RSNs that are common to all subjects (across clusters). Not accounting for these common RSNs may negatively affect C-ICA’s ability to identify the subject clustering and the RSNs for each cluster. Therefore, in order to tackle this problem, two extensions of C-ICA (CCD1 and CCD2) are presented and compared to each other that allow to distinguish between (and extract from the data) both common and distinctive components. Both extensions differ in the procedure to identify the common components, with CCD2 selecting the common components out of a wider pool of possible components than CCD1. In a simulation study, the two C-ICA extensions are compared to C-ICA while manipulating the following factors: number of clusters, number of common and distinctive components, degree of overlap among clusters and amount of noise. Performance was determined by computing cluster recovery and component recovery, where component recovery was studied separately for the common components, the distinctive components and all components. Both extensions clearly outperformed C-ICA, with CCD2 performing the best. A mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that, the degree of overlap and the amount of noise in the data were the most influential factors, with large amounts of overlap and noise decreasing cluster and component recovery. Moreover, both extensions showed a slower deterioration of cluster and component recovery -with increasing overlap and noise- than C-ICA. Specifically for intermediate amounts of noise and overlap the differences between both extensions and C-ICA were the largest.","['ICA', 'clustering', 'resting-state fMRI', 'patient clusters', 'heterogeneity', 'component recovery']"

The material selected was coded through ATLAS.ti into themes informed by the literature review and the theoretical framework. The findings indeed confirm a shift in emerging discourse, whereby solidarity towards and welcoming of Ukrainian refugees is grounded on the pretense of the traditional Christian spirit of providing asylum as well as their cultural and geographic proximity. Simultaneously, the limits of the Christian spirit towards non-European asylum seekers, refugees and immigrants was justified through discourse relying on neo-racist rhetoric based on ‘cultural differentialism’. These arguments often encompass non-European refugees fleeing from Ukraine.","['far-right', 'discourse']"
"The association between social integration and support, medication adherence and gender among transplant recipients","Vliet, Julia van","['Massey, E.K', 'van Zanten, R', 'Peersmann, S.H.M']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Organ transplantation recipients have been shown to struggle with medication adherence, which has severe consequences on their health. Research on medication non-adherence has demonstrated an inconsistent relationship between social integration and support (SIS) and adherence. Two theories can be used to explain a positive association between SIS and adherence. Firstly, according to the Self-Determination Theory, SIS can influence intrinsic motivation, further influencing adherence. Secondly, the Buffer Hypothesis states that high SIS can buffer the impact of negative life experiences that increase non-adherence. Additionally, some studies have suggested that the relationship between SIS and adherence is different for men and women. Aims: The current study studied the effect of SIS on adherence, hypothesizing that higher SIS would be related to adherence. The second hypothesis was that this effect would be stronger among men compared to women. Methods: To investigate the hypotheses in a cross-sectional study, transplant recipients completed questionnaires about their SIS (Health Education Impact Questionnaire) and medication adherence (Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medication Scale). Recipients were recruited from seven transplant departments of five University Medical Centres. Analyses of the following associations were conducted using logistic regression: (1) SIS and medication adherence, (2) SIS and medication adherence with gender as a covariate. Results: Overall, 168 transplant recipients completed the questionnaires. The mean age was 53.87 (SD: 13.8), most participants were male (62.5%) and 17% of the patients were considered medication non-adherent. There was no significant association between SIS and adherence, (OR = 0.955, 95% CI [0.472 – 1.933). This effect was not significantly influenced by gender, (OR = 0.83, 95% CI [0.149 – 4.624]. Conclusion: No significant associations between SIS, gender and medication adherence were reported. A possible explanation for these findings is that other moderating and mediating factors exist and that the relationship between SIS and medication adherence is more complicated than this study was able to examine.

"The relationship between BMI, eating habits and executive functioning in female adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa","Hoogeterp, Lotte",['Karin van der Hiele'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Background: Previous studies found that patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) perform worse on executive functioning (EF) compared to healthy controls (HC’s). EF plays an important role in the regulation of behaviour in daily life. EF impairment can therefore lead to problems with functioning in daily life. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a difference between AN patients and HC’s in EF. In addition, it was investigated whether there is a correlation between EF, eating habits and BMI-SDS. The final aim of this study was to investigate whether EF improves in patients with AN after a one-year follow-up. In each case, the total EF scores and the scores on the 12 subscales of EF were examined. Methods: The study population consisted of 126 girls aged 12-22 years (M= 18.42; SD=2.35), 57 girls belonged to the AN group and 69 to the HC group (M age AN=17.98; M age HC= 18.84). The participants completed the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) and the Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated for the baseline measurements and for the follow-up one year later. Several independentsamples t-tests, linear regression analyses and a linear mixed model analysis were performed as analyses for the results. Results: No differences were found between the AN group and the HC’s with regard to total score of EF, but the AN group did show significantly lower flexibility (p< .001), emotion regulation (p< .001) and taking initiative (p= .001) compared to the HC. However, the AN group did report significantly more orderliness and neatness (p< .001) than the HC. BMISDS and eating habits were not associated with the total score of EF, even after adjusting for the confounders depression and age of onset. The subscales taking initiative (p= .029, inhibition (p= .006) and working memory (p= .010) turned out to be negatively associated with BMI-SDS and eating habits. Finally, there appeared to be no significant change in the total score of EF between the baseline measurement and the follow-up after one year for patients with AN. No significant change was found for the subscales either. Conclusion: AN patients showed impairment on certain subscales of EF, but the overall EF score was not different from the HC’s. The impairment found in subscales of EF did not change from baseline measurement after one year of follow-up. However, the participants in this study were all diagnosed with AN less than a year ago. Further research with a longer follow-up time is needed to find out whether this conclusion is the same for patients with chronic AN or patients who have recovered.","['Anorexia Nervosa', 'BMI', 'Eating Habits', 'Executive functioning']"
Exploring the role of parental suppression of emotion as moderator in the relationship between parent Covid-19 fears and child Covid-19 fears,"André, Berdine","['Nimphy, C.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Scientific background. In 2019, the first cases of the coronavirus (Covid-19) were reported. As a consequence of the new reality, the virus induced a plethora of fears. Fear is an adaptive response in the presence of danger, however, if presented in a continuous and uncertain fashion, it may become chronic and maladaptive. Parents can influence children’s emotional responses via direct and subtle, verbal and non – verbal behaviours. Particularly, parental suppression of emotion can dampen the development of effective coping responses in children. Hypotheses. We expected parental fear to be positively correlated with child fear, and parental suppression of emotion to increase the strength of the relationship between parental Covid-19 fears and child Covid-19 fears. Methods. This study is a cross-sectional design set out to measure fears of Covid-19 and parental suppression of emotion. Parents (N = 219; 24.2% male) and their 8- to 18-year-old children (N = 195; 42.1% male) were recruited. Statistical analyses. A multiple regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between parental Covid-19 fears and child covid-19 fears, and the moderating effect of parental suppression of emotion. Results. Parental Covid-19 fears is significantly associated with child Covid-19 fears, however parental suppression of emotion has no significant effect on the strength of this relationship. Conclusion. Parents’ abilities to efficiently manage their fears are especially crucial during crisis periods such as the Covid-19 pandemic, as this can have a correlating effect on their children’s Covid-19 fears.","['Pandemic', 'parent – child interaction', 'Covid-19 fears', 'parental suppression of emotion', 'fear transmission']"

Furthermore, possible grade-level differences in this relationship were examined. The 26 included studies, which measured print exposure with an author- or title-recognition checklist and reading comprehension and/or reading attitude with various instruments, showed positive, large correlations between print exposure and reading comprehension. Positive, moderate correlations were found between print exposure and reading attitude. The heterogeneity was high in all analyses but could not be explained by the age-groups of the participants. The relationships appeared to be comparable between primary and secondary school students aged 7-16 years. It should be noted that conclusions about the direction of the relationships cannot be indicated. Further research about this direction would be recommended along with more research including different variables that could explain the heterogeneity. Besides the need for more extensive research about the relationship between print exposure and reading comprehension as well as reading attitude it is clear that stimulating children to read more is helpful.","['meta-analyse', 'leeservaring', 'leesattitude', 'leesbegrip', 'print-exposure']"

Sensitiviteit van ouders en de sociale ontwikkeling van peuters en kleuters met SCT,"Dijkhuizen, Lobke","['Krupljanin, N., MSc.', 'Prof. dr. J. T. Swaab']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Objective: About 1:650-1,000 children are born with an extra X or Y chromosome (XXX; XXY; XYY), which results in a sex chromosome trisomy (SCT). Most research in this field focuses on physical aspects, while a small part focuses on executive functioning and social-emotional development. No earlier research was done on parental factors in the social development of this specific group. This study aims to investigate the relationship between parental sensitivity and early social cognitive skills in children with SCT. Method: 74 Children with SCT (range: 3-7 years old, ‘preschoolers’) were included in this study, as well as 71 age-matched nonclinical controls. Scores on two questionnaires (Social Responsiveness Scales, second version: SRS-2, and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, ASQ) were used to measure social skills in preschoolers with SCT and the Freeplay Experiment was used to measure parental sensitivity. Recruitment and assessment took place within a larger project by the Trixy Expertise Centre located at Leiden University, which focuses on early neurological risk factors in young children with SCT. Data collected in this larger project was used in the current study. Results: Results on the SRS-2 and ASQ showed more social difficulties in children with SCT compared to their age-matched nonclinical peers. Parents of children with SCT that showed higher sensitivity during the Freeplay experiment did not have children with stronger social skills. Children with SCT that had parents with higher sensitivity scores did not develop stronger social skills. Conclusions: No impact of parental sensitivity on social cognitive abilities of children with SCT was found. This does not correspond with hypothesized results based on previous research with comparable groups of children. Possible explanations are a small sample leading to smaller generalizability and other factors than parental sensitivity explaining social deficits in children with SCT, which were not accounted for in this study.",['SCT social development sensitivity preschoolers']
Beats That Ring a Bell: An Investigation on the Effects of Alpha & Delta Binaural Beats on Episodic Memory Consolidation,"Dyrvold, Therese","['Varma, S. + Vogelsang, D. A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Neural oscillations are known to underlie the dynamic neural processes related to episodic memory. On the one hand, low-frequency delta waves have been seen to facilitate memory consolidation, while higher frequency alpha waves are associated with more engagement in autobiographical thinking (ABT) which interrupts consolidation. Neural oscillations can be modulated via rhythmic auditory stimulation, also known as binaural beats (BB). Several studies have found that BBs have potential for enhancing cognitive functioning, such as attention and working memory. However, little is known about the efficacy of BB entrainment with regard to episodic memory. In this study, we investigated the effects of listening to alpha (9Hz) and delta (0.5 Hz) BB on episodic memory performance in an old/new recognition task in a within-subjects design. Thirty-six participants underwent three rounds of encoding, each followed by an 8-minute delay during which they listened to either alpha, delta or control BB soundtrack, ending with a recognition test. During BB stimulation, participants also reported the frequency and intensity of ABT. Results showed that listening to alpha and delta BBs did not significantly alter subsequent memory performance, nor did it affect ABT. Additionally, no correlations were found between ABT and memory scores. We discuss limitations to our methods and offer ideas for future research.","['episodic memory', 'neural oscillations', 'entrainment', 'binaural beats', 'autobiographical thinking', 'mind wandering']"

Those Wandering in Darkness Drop From Sight: Examining the Association Between Different Forms of Childhood Maltreatment and Dissociative Symptoms and the Role of Borderline Personality Disorder,"Diedrich, Clara","['Krause-Utz, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Childhood maltreatment is associated with dissociative symptoms in adulthood. However, there are only few empirical studies that differentiate between the different forms of childhood maltreatment which is why it continues to be unclear in what way they may have differing consequences. Moreover, the role of borderline personality disorder (BPD) symptoms in this context is not yet fully understood. In this study, the relationship between the severity of different forms of childhood maltreatment and dissociative symptoms was investigated. Further, it was investigated whether symptoms of BPD account for a significant part of these associations. Deepening this understanding may be helpful in improving prevention and intervention of dissociative disorders. Two datasets were used in this study. The first dataset was collected in The Netherlands and comprised n = 761 individuals. The second dataset was collected in Germany and comprised n = 426 individuals. Linear regression analysis was used to predict the severity of dissociation symptoms based on the severity of childhood maltreatment when accounting for BPD symptoms. Childhood maltreatment predicted dissociation in both datasets. In the first sample, emotional and physical abuse significantly predicted dissociation, with emotional abuse positively predicting dissociation and physical abuse negatively predicting dissociation. In the second dataset, emotional and sexual abuse positively predicted dissociation. In both samples, adding BPD scores accounted for up to 30% of explained variance in the dissociation scores. This study underlines the importance of childhood maltreatment and BPD in the understanding and exploration of dissociation.","['Childhood Maltreatment', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Dissociation', 'Dissociative Symptoms']"
Effects of Dance on Memory Functioning in Multiple Sclerosis: Stable Functional Connectivity of the Hippocampus Within the Default-Mode Network,"Ramsaransing, Brigitta",['Dr. Hanneke E. Hulst'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Background: Memory decline and altered functional connectivity in the default-mode network (DMN) have been widely reported in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Dance has been suggested to induce neuroplasticity and memory improvement, yet it remains unclear whether dance can serve as a tool to improve brain functioning and memory performance in PwMS. Objectives: (a) To examine differences in resting-state functional connectivity between PwMS and healthy controls (HC) at baseline, and (b) to investigate the short-term effects of an 8-week dance intervention on functional connectivity of the hippocampus within the DMN and its association with changes in memory functioning in PwMS. Methods: In total 19 PwMS and 38 matching HC took part in this study. Regarding PwMS (44.53 ± 8.52 years, 15:4 ratio of relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS, with 8.9 ± 8.8 disease duration in years), neuropsychological (Brief Repeatable Battery memory tests), psychological (Multiple Sclerosis Neuropsychological Questionnaire; MSNQ among other questionnaires), and functional MRI data were collected pre-/post-intervention. Data of matching HC (44.68 ± 8.47 years) was adopted from the Amsterdam MS cohort. All PwMS completed an 8-week dance intervention with sessions being held twice a week for one hour each. Repeated measures tests of variances (ANOVAs) and one-tailed Pearson correlations were conducted. Results: Baseline hippocampal connectivity within the DMN was reduced in PwMS compared to HC (p= .036). Following the dance intervention, hippocampus-DMN connectivity remained stable (p= .252). While verbal learning memory improved (65.05 ± 8.38 total score, p= .001), visuospatial memory did not (p= .517). Additional analyses showed improved subjective cognitive functioning indicated by the MSNQ (24.84 ± 9.38 score, p= .035), but this was not associated with changes in objective cognitive functioning (r= -.331, p= .083) nor with changes in functional connectivity (r= -.355, p= .068). Conclusion: Participation in dance can improve verbal learning memory and self-perceived cognitive abilities in PwMS. Either the duration of the intervention was too short to induce a change in hippocampus-DMN connectivity or stable functional connectivity may be regarded as a sign of neuroprotection. Future studies with longer intervention duration and follow-up are needed to further elucidate the benefits of dancing on cognition and brain functioning in PwMS.","['Multiple Sclerosis, Functional Connectivity, Memory Function, Dance Intervention']"
"The Cost of Hedonism: How Price Of Hedonic Activity, Financial Stress and Trait Hedonic Capacity can affect the Enjoyment of an Hedonic Experience","Lisdonk, Laurien van de",['Michael Vliek'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Recent research has highlighted the importance of the ability to enjoy oneself and successfully pursue hedonic goals for subjective well-being. Research identified that individual differences in the ability to enjoy hedonic experiences are explained by the experience of intrusive thoughts. Hypothesizing that individuals with financial stress have more reason to ruminate, it is relevant to investigate financially stressed individuals are being disadvantaged or whether a high ability to enjoy oneself can help to disregard intrusive thoughts about their financial situation. Therefore, current study investigated individual differences in the experience of enjoyable activities and how price, one’s ability to enjoy and financial scarcity can predict hedonic consumer choices. An scenario-study describing a restaurant visit (€25 vs. €60) was performed on a section of the Dutch population (n = 129). Results of the study show that individuals prefer a cheaper restaurant visit when the goal is to maximize pleasure, but prefer a more expensive restaurant when the goal is to maximize quality. Furthermore, having a good ability to enjoy oneself can predict the amount of experienced enjoyment in a expensive restaurant visit. The study did not find a relationship between subjective financial stress and experienced enjoyment. Lastly, contradicting expectations, Trait Hedonic Capacity predicts enjoyment for people without financial stress, but not for individuals with financial stress. Results of current research should be interpreted with care since the used sample did not contain enough participants with financial stress.","['Trait Hedonic Capacity, Subjective Financial Stress, Hedonic Activity, Hedonism, Price, Enjoyment, Subjective Well-Being']"
The Volunteer’s Dilemma: The Influence of Changing Cost/Benefits and Social Value Orientation,"Tonen, Liza","['de Kwaadsteniet, E.W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The volunteer dilemma (VOD) is an example of a social dilemma in which self-interest and collective interest collide (Dawes, 1980; Messick & Brewer, 1983; Kollock, 1998; van Lange et al., 2013; Przepiorka, 2021). Research on VOD is conducted using a game, with n number of players, where the players can volunteer to realize the collective good/interest, at a cost that is less than the benefits it provides (Weesie & Franzen, 1998). In short, within this game, only one actor is required to volunteer to produce benefits for the group (Przepiorka, 2021). The personality variable social value orientation (SVO), that distinguishes between prosocials and proselfs, and time pressure due to increasing costs or decreasing benefits are included in the current study to gain more information about their effect on VOD. The objective of the present study is to test the influence of changing costs/benefits and SVO on the rapidity of people's choice to volunteer. More specifically, we want to examine whether the increasing cost to the volunteer and the decreasing benefits for the collective causes individuals to volunteer more quickly and frequently than in the control condition. The study was conducted through an online experiment on the platform oTree. Participants (n = 150) were randomly assigned to the different conditions. The results of the study show that more people volunteered when the cost remained the same compared to when the cost to the volunteer increased. In addition, the results suggest that people volunteered quicker when the cost to the volunteer increased and the group benefits decreased. Finally, the results show that prosocials volunteered more than proselfs. In future research, higher amounts of money should be used, perceived time pressure should be measured, and motives should be included. In addition, it is also interesting to investigate whether proselfs decide quicker not to volunteer than prosocials decide to volunteer.","['Volunteers Dilemma, social value orientation, changing costs/benefits, time pressure, prosocial, prosily']"

Prediction of Depressive Symptoms from Academic Stress and Sleep Quality in University students,"Gkrozoudi, Ioanna",['Umay Aksungur'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Academic stress is a well-known factor affecting sleep quality and sleep quality has been previously linked with depressive symptoms. Moreover, high academic stress levels are also associated with depressive symptoms in university students. The purpose of the study was to investigate if high levels of academic stress combined with low sleep quality predict depressive symptoms in university students. In addition, the gender difference regarding academic stress and sleep quality was investigated. The study had analytical- observational cohort design, while the same participants were followed on a longitudinal basis during the same academic semester during an exam and an exam-free week. However, this survey used only information from the exam week. The quantitative data were gathered via self-report questionnaires including The Perception of Academic Stress Scale, The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. A total of 32 (30 females and 2 males) students at Leiden University participated in the study. A multiple linear regression was conducted to predict whether academic stress together with sleep quality predicts depression. To investigate gender differences in academic stress and sleep quality an independent samples t-test was used. The findings revealed that sleep quality significantly predicts depressive symptoms, while academic stress does not. Furthermore, contrary to our expectations, results indicated that there is no significant difference between male and female students regarding neither academic stress nor sleep quality. To conclude, there is a profound association between sleep quality and depressive symptoms, but the role of academic stress regarding these symptoms needs to be further investigated. Gender differences should be examined thoroughly while taking into consideration the interplay of the different psycho-social factors affecting men and women. These results suggest that academic stress, low sleep quality and consequently depressive symptoms in university students can significantly impact their everyday function and mental health. With the propensity for mental health issues to hinder the life quality of university students, it is vital that policy makers and health practitioners tailor treatment programs and stress-copying strategies to specifically target their needs.","['academic stress, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, university students']"
The Influence of Mindfulness on Brain Activity and Exploratory Behaviour,"Gray, Olivia","['Judith Schomaker', 'Jan Berend Deijen']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The two most common types of mindfulness are open monitoring (OM) meditation, describing the awareness of internal and external states, and focused attention (FA) meditation, when one fixates on a single stimulus while avoiding distractions. The effects of mindfulness have been well explored and show many beneficial effects. Theta oscillations, associated with learning and memory, increase during OM meditation. Mindfulness is also positively correlated with the trait novelty seeking, as well as openness to experience (OTE). In previous studies, these three variables have been found to interact. The influence of mindfulness on exploratory behaviour has not yet been explored, and research suggests that mindfulness may increase such behaviour. A sample of 39 participants took part in the current study, which was conducted over two consecutive days. Participants received a brief mindfulness intervention on day one or two, after which they explored either a familiar or novel virtual environment. Electroencephalogram (EEG) measures were recorded throughout. Theta power was found to be higher during the OM meditation compared to the control condition, eyes open at rest, suggesting that the current mindfulness intervention was successful in eliciting a mindfulness state by altering the levels of theta power in the brain. Regarding exploratory behaviour, no significant difference was found between those who experienced the meditation and those who did not. Additionally, no difference was found in terms of exploratory behaviour between those in the novel or familiar environment, after receiving the mindfulness intervention. Some reasons for this may be the nature of the mindfulness intervention being brief or not targeted enough at novelty. Further research avenues include exploring additional brain rhythm fluctuations during OM meditation, the influence of different experience levels with mindfulness on different behaviours, as well as whether age affects the influence mindfulness has on exploration behaviour and novelty.","['Mindfulness', 'open monitoring meditation', 'openness to experience', 'exploratory behaviour', 'theta power', 'EEG', 'novelty']"

We hypothesized that parental empathic accuracy (EA) is positively related to adolescents’ perceived parental understanding, that secure attachment moderates this relationship, and that observed parental autonomy support mediates the relationship. Method: This study has a multi-informant, multi-method correlational design. The Problem Solving Interaction Task (PSI) was completed by a control group consisting of 77 adolescents and their parents (n = 132). The question, “How well did your parent understand you?” was used to measure adolescents’ perceived understanding. Using the High Affect Moment task, EA was measured using a correlational method. Attachment was assessed using the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, and parental autonomy support was observed and scored during the PSI task. Results: We found a significant, positive relationship between attachment and adolescents’ perceived understanding. Further, we only found a positive, significant relationship between paternal, but not maternal, EA on negative emotions and adolescents’ perceived paternal understanding, with attachment being a significant moderator. Implications: The relationships between parental EA, adolescents’ perceived understanding, and the moderating effect of attachment seem to depend on context, the parent’s gender, elicited emotions, and our measurements. Future research in different contexts and with additional measures is necessary to see if our results are generalizable. This is relevant because perceived understanding is important for effective communication, relationship satisfaction, well-being, and possibly even for the clinical field. Our study is a great start into the research of adolescents’ perceived understanding.","['Adolescents’ perceived parental understanding, parental empathic accuracy, secure attachment, parental autonomy support, Problem Solving Interaction Task']"

These threats have the ability to influence group behaviour and can have an effect on individual or collective welfare. While evidence suggests that threat exposure can increase cooperation and collective action, there is also evidence that suggests that threats actually break down cooperation. Furthermore, peer punishment is generally seen as a method to maintain cooperation, though usually at the cost of wasted resources. The effects of a shared threat on social decision-making in groups and the impact of peer punishment will be examined in order to test whether the presence of a common threat renders the use of peer punishment obsolete. Individuals (N = 180) in groups of three were exposed to the threat of electric shocks. Heart rate and skin conductance were continuously measured while participants decided how much to contribute to a public good.

Visuo-respiratory Synchronisation in Automated Vehicles. A novel Technique to increase Take-over Speed?,"Radbruch, Merlin",['Francesco Walker'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: To date, automated vehicles (AVs) still require human drivers to take back control upon request. When a take-over request (TOR) is issued, efficient and safe interaction between the AV and the driver needs to be ensured. Visuo-respiratory synchronisation has been proposed as a novel technique to reduce reaction time (RT) to TORs. Objective: In this study, we manipulated visuo-respiratory synchronisation in an automated driving simulation study. We hypothesize that exposing drivers to synchronised ambient light reduces RT and crash rate. In an exploratory fashion, we investigate trust in automation and heart-rate variability (HRV) development. Methods: During a 15-min automated driving phase, drivers were exposed to different types of ambient light. 57 participants were assigned to one of three conditions of pulsing ambient light: synchronised with their breathing (synchronised), in a set frequency (repetitive), or absence of ambient light (no-light). The automation phase ended with the AV issuing a TOR. Drivers had to react as quickly as possible to avoid an obstacle. Results: No significant differences in RT or crash rate between groups were found. An exploratory analysis yielded a significant increase of trust in automation after the simulation compared to before. HRV analysis showed no clearly interpretable results. Conclusion: Our results are conflicting with the results of prior research on visuo-respiratory synchronisation. More research is needed to determine whether visuo-respiratory synchronisation is an effective technique to increase take-over speed in automated driving.","['Automated Driving, Visuo-respiratory Synchronisation, Take-over Requests, Trust, Heart Rate Variability']"

Prof. Dr.,"Admiraal, Sten","['Janmaat, K.R.L']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Aim: This study aimed to find evidence for the theory of Epley et al. (2007), by testing whether people’s likelihood of anthropomorphizing animals is related to the following three self-reported psychological factors: 1) the availability and richness of knowledge structures about animals (elicited agent knowledge), 2) the need to control the environment (effectance motivation), and 3) the need and desire for social contact (sociality motivation). It was hypothesised that people are more likely to anthropomorphize when self-reported elicited agent knowledge is low and self-reported effectance and sociality motivation are high. Methods: A questionnaire was used to obtain the psychological factors. Next, Participants (N = 158; 42 males, 116 females) were instructed to record themselves watching zoo animals or videos of them at home. During these recordings, they had to express their thoughts, feelings, and observations about the animal. The recordings were then used to conduct a speech analysis to measure the participants' anthropomorphic speech. Finally, it was analysed whether anthropomorphic speech correlated with the self-reported psychological factors. Results: The results showed that none of the self-reported psychological factors had an effect on their own. To investigate whether this lack of effect was caused by cross-over interactions, a post-hoc analysis was performed using the interactions of the main predictors added to the model. Results of this analysis showed one significant cross-over interaction between selfreported elicited agent knowledge and effectance motivation. Discussion: Contrary to expectations, anthropomorphic speech was not correlated with any of the self-reported psychological factors separately and therefore all three hypotheses were rejected. However, the cross-over effect found indicates that anthropomorphic speech is more complexly related to self-reported elicited agent knowledge and effectiveness motivation than the theory of Epley et al. (2007) suggests.","['Anthropomorphism', 'Social Cognition', 'Speech', 'Animals']"
De Feuerstein methode: een methode met potentie: Een onderzoek naar de waargenomen effectiviteit van de methode en adviezen over het bevorderen van transfer,"Korthals Altes, Sophie","['Veerbeek, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het Feuerstein Centrum Nederland houdt zich bezig met de behandeling en begeleiding van mensen met leerproblemen en/of ontwikkelingsstoornissen. De methode is gericht op het ontwikkelen van leer- en denkstrategieën vanuit de theorie van Reuven Feuerstein. Bij aanvang van de behandeling met deze methode wordt er een dynamische toets afgenomen, waarbij er een analyse wordt gemaakt van de verschillende cognitieve functies van de cliënt. Tijdens de behandeling wordt er getracht de onderontwikkelde cognitieve functies te ontwikkelen door middel van interactie met een tussenpersoon. Deze rol wordt bij de behandeling vervuld door een zogeheten mediator, die als bemiddelaar tussen de wereld en het kind staat en helpt om betekenis te geven aan alle indrukken en prikkels vanuit de omgeving van de cliënt. Deze mediator doet verschillende soorten oefeningen met de cliënt en focust hierbij voornamelijk op het denkproces in plaats van op de uitkomsten van de oefening. De mediatoren werken vanuit de gedachte dat elk kind effectief kan 'leren leren' door middel van de juiste begeleiding. Het centrum wil met de Feuerstein methode zo veel mogelijk kinderen en jongvolwassenen helpen met achterstanden en leerproblematiek. Om dit te realiseren zou het gunstig zijn als scholen en ouders op de hoogte zijn van de methode en de effectiviteit hiervan, zodat de methode meer bekendheid krijgt. In huidig onderzoek is getracht om de door leerkrachten waargenomen effectiviteit van de methode te onderzoeken. Daarnaast is er onderzocht hoe de methode beter overgedragen kan worden naar de leersituatie in de klas (transfer). Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: “In hoeverre zien leerkrachten effecten op het leergedrag van de kinderen die met de Feuerstein methode behandeld worden in de klas en hoe kunnen volgens de leerkrachten de mediatoren transfer - van wat geleerd is tijdens de behandeling - naar de klas bevorderen?” Om tot beantwoording van de onderzoeksvraag te komen is er een kwalitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd. Deze bestond uit een literatuuronderzoek en semigestructureerde interviews. In totaal zijn er vier participanten geïnterviewd; twee leerkrachten en twee mediatoren. Uit het literatuuronderzoek is gebleken dat voor een goede transfer er zo veel mogelijk overeenkomsten gecreëerd moeten worden tussen de leersituatie en de situatie waarin het geleerde toegepast moet worden. Daarnaast is het hebben van een growth mindset bij zowel leerkrachten als leerlingen bevorderlijk voor de leerprestaties van leerlingen. Uit de interviews is gebleken dat alle participanten een goed contact tussen het Feuerstein centrum en de leerkracht belangrijk achten, maar sommigen hierin tekorten hebben ervaren. Aan de hand van de literatuur en de interviews zijn de volgende adviezen opgesteld voor het Feuerstein centrum: (1) verbeteren van het contact tussen het centrum en de leerkracht (2) de leerkracht informeren over de behandeling met de Feuerstein methode en (3) concrete tips aanreiken aan de leerkrachten. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat goede communicatie tussen het centrum en de leeromgeving belangrijk is. Wanneer zowel de mediatoren als de leerkrachten voldoende op de hoogte zijn van de doelen van de cliënt, kunnen zij efficiënter aan dit gezamenlijke doel werken. Door het informeren van de leerkracht en het aanbieden van praktische tips kan het centrum de leerkracht ondersteunen om de contexten beter op elkaar te laten aansluiten, wat de transfer bevorderd. Een limitatie aan dit onderzoek is dat er slechts vier participanten hebben deelgenomen aan het onderzoek. Een advies voor vervolgonderzoek zou zijn om dit onderzoek op een grotere schaal uit te voeren. Met een grotere steekproef kan er meer duidelijkheid ontstaan over de visie van leerkrachten en mediatoren omtrent de methode.",

Het Feuerstein Centrum Nederland wil de discrepantie tussen deze methode en de hedendaagse pedagogische wetenschap overbruggen. In dit onderzoek wordt de vraag gesteld wat de kern is van de Feuersteinmethode en welke koppeling er is met de hedendaagse pedagogische wetenschap. Er is een literatuuronderzoek uitgevoerd en een paneldiscussie gevoerd met de begeleiders van het Feuerstein Centrum om deze vraag te beantwoorden. Het literatuuronderzoek heeft uitgewezen dat er koppelingen zijn tussen mediatiecriteria en pedagogische theorieën. De paneldiscussie heeft aangetoond welke mediatiecriteria van de Feuersteinmethode de kern vormen volgens de begeleiders. Vervolgens zijn de resultaten van het literatuuronderzoek en de paneldiscussie met elkaar vergeleken. Hieruit kan geconcludeerd worden dat drie pedagogische theorieën de kern vormen van de Feuersteinmethode: zelfdeterminatietheorie, executieve functies en zone van naaste ontwikkeling. Op basis hiervan worden drie adviezen gegeven. Ten eerste wordt een aanbeveling gedaan over de huidige handelswijze van de mediatoren. Ten tweede wordt een aanbeveling gedaan hoe de Feuersteinmethode aangevuld kan worden. Als laatste wordt een aanbeveling gedaan hoe met externen gecommuniceerd kan worden over de inhoud van de Feuersteinmethode op basis van de gevonden pedagogische theorieën.",

"Do Parenting Skills and Family Functioning Differently Influence The Developmental Rate of Early Social Cognitive Skills of Children With Sex Chromosome Trisomy (XXX, XXY, XYY)?","Zwaan, Berk van der",['Dr. Sophie van Rijn'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Developmental Psychopathology in Education and Child Studies (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"One in 650-1000 individuals has sex chromosome trisomy (SCT), being born with an extra X or Y chromosome (XXX; XXY; XYY). SCT comes with various developmental risks. The present study was designed to evaluate the relation between parental factors (parenting skills (parental reflective functioning, sensitivity, and intrusiveness) and family functioning) and the social cognitive skills and its rate of development of children with SCT. Literature suggests that parenting skills and family functioning influence social cognitive development in typical children, but this has not been researched in children with SCT. Included in this study were 106 children with SCT and 102 controls (age M = 3.65, SD = 1.78 range = .98-7.66). A free play task, the parental developmental interview, and a questionnaire were used for evaluating parental factors, and the social cognitive skills of the child were measured using the ASIEP-3. Children with SCT showed significant impairments in social cognitive skills while the rate of development of social cognitive skills proved identical to controls. Parental sensitivity, intrusiveness, and reflective functioning were similar across groups and were found to not significantly influence social cognitive development. Family functioning was found to be positively related to the social cognitive skills of SCT children. However, family functioning did not influence the rate of social cognitive development of either SCT or control groups. The findings imply other factors to be of more importance in the social cognitive development of children with SCT at the average ages of 1-2 years and 3-6 years. It is recommended to research other factors, namely brain maturation and timing of diagnosis. Further knowledge about which factors stimulate the development of the social cognitive abilities of children with SCT, to what extent and at what age, is of importance as this may help to develop and personalize prevention and intervention programs.","['SCT', 'Sex Chromosome Trisomy', 'Parenting Skills', 'Social Cognition', 'XXX', 'XXY', 'XYY', 'Development']"

This research aims to close the knowledge gap on the effect of mindfulness meditation on spatial exploration behavior. The present study uses a 2 (novel/familiar environment) between-subjects factor x 2 (mindfulness/control condition) within-subjects factor mixed design. Out of the total sample of 38 participants a final sample of 28 healthy participants was included in the data analysis. On two separate days participants were to follow either a mindfulness meditation session or a control condition after which they were to explore an either familiar (already encountered on day 1) or novel virtual environment. Spatial exploration behavior was assessed via a roaming entropy, whilst brain activity was measured by means of an electroencephalogram. No difference between the spatial exploration behavior of participants who explored the novel environment after a mindfulness meditation was found. However, participants showed significantly greater theta activity during the mindfulness meditation compared to an eyes-closed-resting state. Likewise, significantly larger theta activity was also observed during the exploration of a novel environment after participants followed a mindfulness meditation session compared to a baseline. Lastly, a positive correlation was discovered between theta activity and spatial exploration behavior in a novel environment after mindfulness meditation.","['EEG, mindfulness meditation, novelty, spatial exploration, theta brain waves']"

The effectiveness of activity mapping on finding a fitting activity for nursing home residents with dementia,"Brontsema, Robert",['Anne Cuperus'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Worldwide, 55 million people live with dementia, and this number is expected to double in the coming decades. The main care goal for people with dementia involves the improvement of Quality of Life (QoL). Several studies have outlined the importance of activities in increasing QoL. Therefore, the present research explored activities in nursing homes that contributed to the QoL of residents with dementia. Additionally, the study investigated if actively mapping activity preferences of residents lead to better-fitting activities, which mapping methods best predict this, and whether informal caregivers score lower than healthcare professionals on how well they perceive activities to fit residents. In total, 103 healthcare professionals and 95 informal caregivers filled in an online survey. Results indicate that most activities provided in a nursing home tend to contribute strongly to the QoL of a resident with dementia. Additionally, residents who had their activities mapped were believed to engage in better fitting activities than those whose activities were not mapped. Specifically, mapping by means of direct conversation as well as by means of a book shows to positively predict activities to better fit to the residents. Furthermore, examining a possible disconnect between informal caregivers and healthcare professionals showed no difference in the extent to which they perceive activities to fit the residents. While this study outlines the importance of mapping activities to ensure activities fit the residents, it also reveals that—when it comes to contributing to QoL—the nature of the activity may not be as important as the participation in the activity.","['nursing home residents, activity mapping, quality of life, perceived activity fit, meaningful activities']"

Volgens de oud-Griekse Pyrronistische filosofie zorgt het afwegen van argumenten over non-evidente zaken voor het opschorten van de mening. Uiteindelijk zal dit leven vrij van oordeel angsten wegnemen en een staat van kalmte bereiken. Deze toestand wordt door de Pyrronisten ataraxia genoemd en staat gelijk aan geluk. In dit onderzoek is onderzocht of het Pyrronisme werkelijk verband houdt met geluk. Om de onafhankelijke variabele te meten is een vragenlijst opgesteld, de Suspension of Judgementrevised (SOJ-revised). Samen met de GAD-7 en de Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) is hier een testbatterij van gemaakt die online is afgenomen in een steekproef van ongeveer 200 mensen. De eerste hypothese was dat de Pyrronistische houding een positieve relatie heeft met geluk. De tweede hypothese was dat een conservatieve politieke voorkeur deze relatie verzwakt. Een progressieve politieke voorkeur zou deze relatie versterken. De hoofdanalyse was alleen significant met de GAD-7 als afhankelijke variabele. Met zowel de GAD-7 als de SWLS was de moderatieanalyse niet significant. Dit onderzoek dient als bewijs dat de eeuwenoude Pyrronistische filosofie nog steeds relevant kan zijn in de huidige maatschappij als het gaat om angst. Ook kan geconcludeerd worden dat de politieke voorkeur deze relatie niet beïnvloedt.",

Social support and life events: Influence on relapses in bipolar disorder in older patients,"Cusell, Hanna",['Rob Kok and Jan Dirk Blom'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Introduction: Few studies have focused on factors that determine the course of bipolar disorder in older patients. I therefore investigated the role of life events and social support, in a polarity-specific model that allowed for a distinction between depressive and manic relapses. Furthermore, I investigated the influence of social support on the relation between life events and type op relapse. Methods: To investigate the influence of life events and the possible buffering effects of social support on the course of bipolar disorder, I recruited 52 patients. To investigate the role of social support, I recruited 100 patients, which included the 52 patients mentioned above. All participants were ≥55 years of age, had a diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder and received treatment in a mental health institute. Life charts were formed by searching the electronic patient files, from which information on life events and relapses was collected. After searching the electronic patient files for clues on social support, I divided these in seven social-support variables. Results: No significant associations were found between type of life event and type of relapse. However, I did find significant associations between two social support variables, namely ‘quality of social support’ and ‘children’, and type of relapse. However, these did not support the polarity-specific model. The results further suggested that a higher quality of social support was related to a lower number of relapses in general (depressive and (hypo)manic). No significant interaction-effects were found. Conclusion: I found two social-support variables that are significantly associated with the type of relapse in elderly patients with bipolar disorder. Furthermore, I found indications that improving social support may help prevent relapses.","['social support, life events, relapses, bipolar disorder, older patients']"
De Prijs van het Hedonisme: De invloed van financiële stress op de subjectieve ervaring van hedonistische activiteiten,"Shirzad, Arzo","['Vliek, M.L.W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"The present study looked at whether a person's financial situation influences one's ability to enjoy cheap and expensive hedonic activities. This research was conducted by means of an online questionnaire that was completed by 137 Dutch respondents. This consisted of three questionnaires, namely the Psychological Inventory of Financial Scarcity (PIFS), the Trait Hedonic Capacity (THC) and the self-developed Cost of Hedonism (COH). The PIFS assesses the subjective state of financial stress. The THC measures the extent to which people enjoy hedonic activities and to what extent they suffer from intrusive thoughts. The Cost of Hedonism asks about the extent to which people can enjoy eight activities, offering four types of activities that differ in price (expensive or cheap). The results show that the amount of pleasure people experience during hedonic activities is not dependent on the successful pursuit of hedonic goals and the extent to which people suffer from intrusive thoughts. A significant negative relationship was found between financial stress and the ability to enjoy hedonic activities. The influence of financial stress is greater for the expensive activities than for the cheap activities. It can be concluded from the current research that people with more financial stress are less likely to enjoy more expensive hedonic activities than people with little financial stress. Follow-up research could look at ways to reduce financial stress through different coping strategies.",
"The association between social integration and support, medication adherence and gender among transplant recipients","Vliet, Julia van","['Massey, E.K + van Zanten, R. + Peersmann, S.H.M']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Organ transplantation recipients have been shown to struggle with medication adherence, which has severe consequences on their health. Research on medication non-adherence has demonstrated an inconsistent relationship between social integration and support (SIS) and adherence. Two theories can be used to explain a positive association between SIS and adherence. Firstly, according to the Self-Determination Theory, SIS can influence intrinsic motivation, further influencing adherence. Secondly, the Buffer Hypothesis states that high SIS can buffer the impact of negative life experiences that increase non-adherence. Additionally, some studies have suggested that the relationship between SIS and adherence is different for men and women. Aims: The current study studied the effect of SIS on adherence, hypothesizing that higher SIS would be related to adherence. The second hypothesis was that this effect would be stronger among men compared to women. Methods: To investigate the hypotheses in a cross-sectional study, transplant recipients completed questionnaires about their SIS (Health Education Impact Questionnaire) and medication adherence (Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medication Scale). Recipients were recruited from seven transplant departments of five University Medical Centres. Analyses of the following associations were conducted using logistic regression: (1) SIS and medication adherence, (2) SIS and medication adherence with gender as a covariate. Results: Overall, 168 transplant recipients completed the questionnaires. The mean age was 53.87 (SD: 13.8), most participants were male (62.5%) and 17% of the patients were considered medication non-adherent. There was no significant association between SIS and adherence, (OR = 0.955, 95% CI [0.472 – 1.933). This effect was not significantly influenced by gender, (OR = 0.83, 95% CI [0.149 – 4.624]. Conclusion: No significant associations between SIS, gender and medication adherence were reported. A possible explanation for these findings is that other moderating and mediating factors exist and that the relationship between SIS and medication adherence is more complicated than this study was able to examine. Alternatively, the type of SIS studied was not specific enough to be associated with adherence. Future studies should investigate the factors that influence medication adherence and specify the type of SIS that is crucial for increasing medication adherence.","['organ transplantation', 'psychology', 'social integration and support', 'social support', 'medication adherence', 'adherence', 'gender']"

The aim of this study was to examine if there is a difference in how observers judge both the help provider and the help itself, depending on whether a motive to appear moral (morality) or a motive to appear social (sociability) was used. An experiment was conducted in which participants (N = 209) read a scenario about a group offering help based on the strategic motive to appear moral or social. Within this scenario it was manipulated whether the underlying motive for the help was in line with the actual traits of the help provider. The scenario was followed by a questionnaire. Results of this study showed that participants had a more positive attitude towards the help providers when they acted in line with their actual traits (reality congruence) compared to when they acted inconsistently with who they truly are (reality incongruence). Unexpectedly, no significant results were found that showed a difference in attitude towards the help provider depending on morality and sociability. Other results showed that help providers induced more negative attitudes when they behaved inconsistently with who they truly are, compared to when they behaved in line with their actual traits, because they were perceived as more hypocritical. Considering we were unable to find any significant results of the strategic use of warmth dimensions, more research on this topic is necessary.

A study about the extent of observed upper body movement, smiling and frowning and experienced social anxiety.","Zwaard, Lisanne","['Bos, E.J. van den']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Socially anxious individuals often worry about social outcomes. Social situations are experienced as threatening and are endured with a lot of stress and anxiety. The human's physiological and behavioral response to threat is coordinated by the stress response system. Previous research provided support that spontaneous body sway and autonomic responses to, purely social threat cues, involve a complex freeze-like pattern of behavior. Socially anxious individuals can also show different facial expressions. Research provided evidence for more blank facial expressions by people who score higher on social anxiety during a socially anxious situation. This study investigated the relation between social anxiety and upper body movement, smiling and frowning. It is hypothesized that individuals who show less upper body movement, less smiling and less frowning score higher on socially anxiety. Healthy participants (N = 68; 14 male and 54 female), aged 18 to 39 years old (M = 22.40; SD = 3.90), reporting normal vision, participated in an interaction with an avatar that showed interactive nonverbal behavior. Social anxiety was measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. The frequency and duration of body movements, smiles and frowns were coded based on the videos of the participants. Data were analysed using regression analysis. Upper body movement, smiling and frowning were separately treated as independent variables and social anxiety as a dependent variable. The results show no relation with social anxiety. Neither did the results of a multiple regression analysis show that one type of behavior was more characteristic of individuals with social anxiety. This is in contrast with the literature. Limitations of the present study are discussed and suggestions for further research are offered. Identifying behaviors at an early stage could be helpful for early interventions or prevention of social anxiety.","['Social anxiety', 'freeze response', 'stress response system', 'facial expression', 'body movement']"
Is the association between child and parent fear of Covid-19 mediated by parental verbal threat information or moderated by parent gender?,"Frank, Sydney",['Cosima Nimphy'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Rachman’s three-pathway theory of fear acquisition specifies that there are three distinct methods through which fear can be acquired. One of these pathways is verbal threat information transmission. The first aim of this study was to determine whether parental verbal transmission mediates the association between parental fear of Covid-19 and child fear of Covid-19. The secondary aim was to determine whether parent gender moderates the association between parent and child fear of Covid-19. The sample consisted of 215 children (59.3% girls, M(age) = 14.25) and 215 parents (74.1% mothers, M(mother age) = 47.33, M(father age) = 49.05). Participants living in South Holland filled out an online survey about fear of Covid-19, verbal threat transmission in relation to their children and temperamental anxiety. Against expectations, we found that parental verbal threat transmission did not mediate the association between parent and child fear of Covid-19. Parent gender was not found to moderate the association between parent and child fear of Covid-19. Both covariates included in the moderation model were found to be non-significant. Results are discussed with reference to current fear learning literature, both in the context of Covid-19 and beyond.

It is imperative to examine what the relationship is between having a chronically ill family member and adolescent drug use, since substance abuse may result in negative long-term consequences like physical disease, crime, or interpersonal violence. This study utilized a cross-sectional design with a sample of 14,729 Dutch students (50.0% female, mean age = 14.2) attending high-school classes two (n = 7396) or four (n = 7333) and compared three chronic family illnesses. Adolescents with somatic family illness (n = 2446, 51.7% female, mean age = 14.2), mental family illness (n = 1287, 60.1% female, mean age = 14.4), and familial addiction (n = 860, 48.6% female, mean age = 14.5), were compared to controls (n = 10136, 50.3% female, mean age = 14.2). Familial addiction was linked to more soft drug use compared to a somatic or mental family illness or controls. Mental family illness was not associated with more soft drug use compared to somatic family illness or controls. Lastly, the relation between familial addiction and soft drug use was partially mediated by adolescent stress, so adolescents with elevated stress displayed more soft drug use. The findings of this study suggest a need for interventions for adolescents with a chronically ill family member to enhance their knowledge concerning how to deal with the burden of having a chronically ill family member.","['Chronically ill family member', 'adolescent substance abuse']"

The same goes for the influence of dysfunctional beliefs about sleep (DBS), a perpetuating factor of insomnia. The aim of this study was to investigate whether older psychiatric inpatients report fewer insomnia symptoms and fewer DBS after a brief CBT-i intervention than before the intervention, and whether a possible decrease in DBS is associated with a decrease in insomnia severity. This is a quasi-experimental investigation with a one-group pretest-posttest design. A total of 27 participants (18 women, 9 men, mean age 71.4 (±7.8) years) completed a brief CBT-i intervention (N=27) and completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at baseline (T1), after the intervention (T2) and after 7 weeks (T3). The Dysfunctional beliefs about sleep scale (DBAS) was completed at T1 and T2. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that mean ISI scores differed significantly between time points (F(2,34)=13.4, p < .001). Post hoc analyses with a Bonferroni adjustment revealed that ISI scores were significantly decreased from T1 to T2 (5.4 (95% CI, 2.1 to 8.7), p =.001), and from T1 to T3 (8.0 (95% CI, 2.9 to 13.1), p =.002), but not from T2 to T3 (2.6 (95% CI, -1.3 to 6.5), p =.283). A paired samples t-test showed no significant difference in DBS before and after the intervention (T(13)=0.7, p=.522). No association was found between the pretest-posttest differences in DBS and the pretest-posttest differences in insomnia severity scores (B(13)= - 1.2, p=.644). This brief CBT-i intervention seems feasible to implement in this population and the decrease of ISI scores after the intervention is promising. The insignificant results considering the DBAS scores can perhaps be a motive to further develop this line of research.",
"Sexual minorities at risk? Investigating the relationship between religiosity, parental acceptance and psychological wellbeing of SMI.","Noel, Lucille","['Reinken, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Research shows that sexual minorities (SMI) are at higher risks of developing mental health problems. However, there is little knowledge about what helps SMI to thrive, which is why it crucial to find new factors that could protect their mental wellbeing. Previous studies showed that parental acceptance is one protective factor while religiosity represents a risk factor for the psychological wellbeing of SMI. This study investigates whether parental acceptance mediates the relationship between religiosity and psychological wellbeing of SMI. 186 participants who identify as sexual minorities filled out an online survey which was analyzed. A mediation analysis showed that contrarily to the hypothesis, parental acceptance was not found to act as a mediator (however, it was found that higher parental acceptance does predict higher psychological wellbeing of sexual minorities). Religiosity was found neither to be corelated to Parental acceptance (r(184) = -0.1, p= .18), nor to Psychological Wellbeing (r(184) =-0,06, p=.42). The effect of religiosity on wellbeing correcting for parental acceptance (indirect effect number) was found to be insignificant, (t = -0.66, p = 0.5). Moreover, the effect of religiosity on wellbeing (direct effect number) was also found to be insignificant (t = -1.04 p = .297). Limitations of the study included the fact that only few of the participants identified as religious and hence further studies should focus on religious communities.","['sexual minorities, risk, psychological-wellbeing, religiosity']"
Hoe de rekenmethode en instructie van de leerkracht effect hebben op het strategiegebruik van leerlingen bij het uitrekenen van deelsommen,"Mackenzie, Laurine","['Maas, J.', 'Hickendorff, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"The performances of primary school students are equal when comparing students using a traditional mathematics textbook and students using a realistic mathematics textbook. However, little is known about the strategy use of these students. In this study the relationships are examined between the textbooks (traditional or realistic) and strategy use, between instruction of the teacher and strategy use and between the textbooks and instruction. Besides, it is examined how the instruction of the teacher effects the relationship between textbooks and strategy use. Students of the sixth grade (N = 2133) of randomly drawn Dutch primary schools made two or three division problems according to an incomplete research design. Their notes were analysed and categorised in three kinds of strategies: the traditional algorithm for long division, the column-based division and other strategies. A coding system was used. Three direct relationships were found for the two examined division problems: between textbooks and strategy use, between instruction and strategy use and between textbooks and instruction. Students using a traditional textbook or receiving instruction in the traditional algorithm used the traditional algorithm more often than students using a realistic textbook or students who did not receive the instruction. Column-based division was only used by students using a realistic textbook. Instruction in the traditional algorithm was more often given when using a traditional textbook in comparison to using a realistic textbook. The correlation between textbooks and strategy use could be partially explained by the instruction of the teacher. So, textbooks as well as instruction correlate with the strategy use in division problems. This is the reason it is important that schools are critical when selecting a new mathematics textbook and look for ways to optimize the instruction of the teachers.","['strategiegebruik', 'kolomsgewijs delen', 'staartdeling', 'rekeninstructie', 'rekenmethode', 'deelsommen']"

Longitudinal Associations between Responses to Social Stress and Social Anxiety in Adolescents: Gender Differences,"Antonova, Yoana","['Blöte, A.W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The association between responses to stress and psychopathology seems to be well established, yet there is only one study so far which has investigated the longitudinal relationships between social anxiety and responses to social stress in adolescents. The aims of the present study were to replicate findings from previous research and to explore the moderating effect of gender on the bidirectional prospective associations between responses to social stress and social anxiety. It was hypothesized that the current study would replicate the findings that primary control engagement coping (i.e., problem solving, emotional regulation, emotional expression) predicts social anxiety symptoms over time. In congruence with previous studies, it was also expected for girls to score higher on both variables. Moreover, it was hypothesized that the above-mentioned prospective association would be moderated by gender and would be stronger in girls. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess social anxiety symptoms and responses to social stress in a community sample of 153 adolescents (77 boys and 76 girls) between the ages of 12 and 17 at T1 (i.e., Time 1) and 14 and 19 at T2 (i.e., Time 2). The present study did not reproduce some of the findings stemming from previous research, the possible reasons for which have been explored and reviewed in the discussion. Furthermore, it was found that gender moderated the relationship between social anxiety at T1 and involuntary disengagement (e.g., inaction, emotional numbing) at T2, which association was significant and positive in girls and non-significant in boys. In contrast to the initial hypothesis, the association between primary control coping at T1 and social anxiety at T2 was not moderated by gender. The relevance of these findings, as well as the limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are presented in the discussion.","['social anxiety, responses to social stress, adolescence, gender, longitudinal design']"
Life After ICU Admission: Differences in Depressive Symptoms Between COVID and non-COVID Patients,"Vlug, Alida Elisa","['Veldhuijzen, D.S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Yearly, many patients get admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) worldwide, with even more admissions since the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. With the rising survival number, investigating the long-term Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) outcomes, which can be negatively influenced by depressive symptoms, became important. This study investigates whether there is a difference in depressive symptoms between COVID-19 and non-COVID patients that got admitted to the ICU; how depressive symptoms influence the HRQoL, and if there is a difference in HRQoL between COVID-19 patients and non-COVID patients; and if there is a relationship between the self-reported health, happiness, and satisfaction about the ICU stay and depressive symptoms. It was expected that COVID-19 patients would have a higher mean score on depressive symptoms than non-COVID patients, COVID-19 patients with depressive symptoms have lower HRQoL scores than non-COVID patients, and lastly, that there would be a negative relation between the self-reported health, happiness and satisfaction about the ICU stay and depressive symptoms. In this study, 278 patients participated. Approximately one year after ICU discharge, patients filled out a survey. For this study, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Euroqol Quality of Life (EQ6D), and general questions about the health, happiness, and satisfaction of the ICU stay were taken into account. An independent t-test demonstrated significant higher mean scores on depressive symptoms in COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID patients (p < .05). Regression analysis showed that depressive symptoms predicted HRQoL (p < .05), but HRQoL was not different between COVID versus non-COVID (p = .225). Regression analysis showed both health and happiness predicted depressive symptoms(p < .05), but not between satisfaction and depressive symptoms (p = .318). The results confirmed our hypothesis that there would be higher mean scores on depressive symptoms in COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID patients. Our findings are clinically relevant and can be used to provide better mental health care after ICU discharge. Follow-up studies should among other things focus on the length of ICU stay, the time during the pandemic that someone got admitted to the ICU, and the depressive symptoms two years after ICU discharge.","['COVID-19', 'Depressive symptoms', 'HRQoL', 'Pandemic', 'prospective cohort study']"

The current study investigates whether descriptive norms and gender have an effect on entrepreneurs’ work-life balance crafting behaviour. It was hypothesized that descriptive norms would positively predict work-life balance crafting behaviour and that women would have a harder time crafting their work-life balance than men. It was also hypothesized that gender would moderate descriptive norms' effect on entrepreneurs' work-life balance management. This correlational research was conducted with a questionnaire. The results showed that descriptive norms indeed had a positive effect on work-life balance management.

How Internalised Homonegativity and Self- Respect effect Psychological Well-Being: Decreasing Internalised Homonegativity relates to increasing Self-respect and Psychological Well- being,"Aken, Noor van",['Aischa Reinken'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Introduction Mental health problems are a lot more prevalent in Sexual Minority Individuals (SMI; non-heterosexuals individuals) than in the general population. Therefore, this study will investigate how psychological well-being can be increased by looking at how Internalised Homonegativity (IH; negative feelings towards someone’s own non- heterosexuality) effects psychological well-being directly and indirectly with self- respect as mediator. Methods 345 respondents completed 12 questionnaires, 3 of which are focused on in the current study (the Internalised Homonegativity subscale of the LGBIS, the OHQ-SF (measuring psychological well-being), and The Self-respect measure). A multiple regression analysis and a mediation analysis were conducted. Results Internalised homonegativity was found to significantly predict psychological well- being. Other findings consisted of a significantly negative effect from internalised homonegativity on self-respect and a significantly positive effect from self-respect on psychological well-being. Discussion We found that IH negatively predicted psychological well-being. Additionally, we found that IH negatively effects self-respect and in turn, self-respect positively effects psychological well-being. Conclusion Reducing mental health problems in SMI can be achieved by decreasing IH to increases self-respect which in turn increases psychological well-being. Increased psychological well-being means decreased mental health problems in SMI.",

Therefore this study aims to describe what is known about their lifetime prevalence and phenomenological presentation, based on a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. Of the 2131 identified articles in which the abstract included the terms BPD and hallucination and/or delusion, 20 met my inclusion criteria (regarding 1747 patients in total). Based on these articles I calculated a lifetime prevalence of 27% for hallucinations and of 15% for delusions in people with BPD. Most common were auditory verbal hallucinations (lifetime prevalence = 29%) and persecutory delusions (lifetime prevalence = 10%). Due to the use of slightly different diagnostic criteria for BPD in some of the included studies, which were in turn due to changes made in subsequent versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), not all studies were equally well comparable. An implication for future research is the advice to conduct another literature review and meta-analysis five years from now with new studies using DSM-5 criteria. Another implication is the advice to assess the prevalence of hallucinations and delusions in a subgroup of people with BPD and an intellectual disability, since we found them to be most common in this group.","['Meta-analysis', 'borderline', 'hallucinations', 'delusions', 'prevalence']"
Is het effect van afgeleid eten op BMI afhankelijk van slaapkwaliteit?

Recent werk suggereert dat afleiding tijdens het eten gerelateerd is aan een toenemende voedselinname en mogelijke gewichtstoename. Bovendien suggereert recent werk dat de hoeveelheid slaap invloed kan hebben op deze relatie. Om inzicht te krijgen tussen consumptiepatronen, BMI en slaap werd er een correlatieanalyse en een moderatie-analyse uitgevoerd op basis van verzamelde data van 135 respondenten tussen de 16 en 60 jaar oud (N = 135, M = 26, SD = 9,81). Er was geen sprake van een hoofdeffect van afleiding op BMI en er was geen sprake van een hoofdeffect van de totale score op PSQI op BMI. Tevens was er geen interactie-effect van zowel afleiding als de totale PSQI-score op BMI. Uit exploratieve analyses bleek dat de slaapkwantiteit in tegenstelling tot slaapkwaliteit wel correleert met de totale score op afleiding (r = ,34, p = ,039). De hoeveelheid geslapen uren had effect op verschillende soorten afleiding tijdens het ontbijt, de lunch en het diner (niet op het eten van een snack) waarbij een korte slaapduur resulteerde in een mindere mate van afleiding. Deze bevindingen benadrukken de invloed van het aantal uren slaap dat een individu heeft op de mate afleiding tijdens het eten.","['Slaap', 'Slaapkwaliteit', 'Body Mass Index', 'Lichaamsgewicht', 'Consumptie', 'Voedingsgedrag', 'Afgeleid eten', 'Afleiding']"

Eén van deze problemen is een laag zelfvertrouwen, dit heeft negatieve gevolgen voor de rest van het leven. Doel Deze studie deed onderzoek naar de relatie tussen verschillende typen kindermishandeling en zelfvertrouwen in de adolescentie en de rol die sekse hierbij speelt. Methoden De data zijn verkregen uit een multi-method two-generation onderzoek genaamd RE-PAIR (Janssen et al., 2021). De Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (Short-Form) (Bernstein & Fink, 1997) en de Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Avison & Rosenberg, 1981) zijn ingevuld door 115 respondenten (78 meiden en 37 jongens), waarvan 80 niet-klinische adolescenten en 35 adolescenten met depressie. Door middel van regressieanalysen zijn de relaties en moderatie onderzocht. Resultaten Kindermishandeling verklaart een significant deel van de variantie in zelfvertrouwen (R2 = .130; p < .05). Emotionele mishandeling is de sterkste negatieve voorspeller van het zelfvertrouwen (β = -.293; t(86) = -2,287; p < .05). Daarnaast bleek er een interactie-effect te zijn van sekse (t(88) = - 2,554; p < .05). Bij meiden hangt emotionele mishandeling significant negatief samen met het zelfvertrouwen (β = -.443; t(61) = -3.856; p = < .001), maar niet bij jongens (β = .048; t(27) = .249; p = .805). Discussie Kindermishandeling heeft een negatief verband met zelfvertrouwen, waarbij met name emotionele mishandeling een grote rol speelt. Bij meiden daalt het zelfvertrouwen bij het meemaken van mishandeling. Nu we kennis hebben van deze relatie, kunnen we proberen weinig zelfvertrouwen te beperken of voorkomen bij mishandelde populaties.","['kindermishandeling', 'zelfvertrouwen', 'emotionele mishandeling']"

Exploring The Relationship Between Multiple Risk Factors and Depression: A Network Analysis,"Diehl, Elisabetta",['Ricarda Proppert'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Depression is one of the most common health problems among the student population and as such, it is crucial to understand and identify the factors that contribute to its onset and persistence. The network approach to psychopathology conceptualizes mental health disorders as complex systems of interrelated factors. This approach facilitates the identification of key risk factors associated with the onset and maintenance of depression. The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between multiple risk factors for depression and their interrelations using a network approach. A sample of 444 Dutch higher education students were assessed with multiple scales measuring several risk factors previously associated with depression. The associations between these risk factors and depression were then estimated in a regularized Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM). A total of eleven nodes were included in the network, and centrality measures and the stability and accuracy of the network were studied. Specific nodes that occupied critical positions in the network were identified, with current stress, depression, repetitive negative thinking and pessimism being the most central nodes. Depression showed the highest positive associations with current stress and sleep problems. These explorative findings offer guidance on the relative importance of certain risk factors, such as current stress, repetitive negative thinking, and pessimism over other risk factors in the network. These results could possibly have important implications for the future study and prevention of depression in higher education students. Longitudinal studies are needed to expand on these preliminary findings.","['Network analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Depression', 'Network approach']"

COVID-19 fears in parents and children: the impact of experiences with the virus and the role of emotional regulation.,"Baptiste, Shontel",['Nimphy C.A.'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Rachman's (1977) three pathways theory of fear acquisition posits that fear is acquired through modelling, conditioning, and information. Understanding fear acquisition by exploring these pathways in the context of the pandemic can assist in identifying predictors for fear of the virus and understand the impact pandemics can have on parents and their children. Objective: The purpose of the current study was to explore whether maladaptive emotion regulation strategies play a moderating role in the relationship between COVID-19 experiences and fear of the virus in parents and children and the relationship between threat information from the parent and their child's fear of COVID-19. Method: Two hundred parent-child dyads were recruited in the Netherlands. They completed an online questionnaire measuring their fear of the virus, experience with the virus, emotion regulation strategies and verbal threat information from the parent to their child. Results: Parents who did not have experience with the virus had more fear of the virus than parents who did have experience. Children's experience with the virus was unrelated to their fear of it. Increased threat communication by the parent was related to increased fear of the COVID-19 virus in their child. The increased use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies did not moderate these relationships. Conclusion: These findings suggest that increased threat information from parents to their children about the virus can increase fears about it. Furthermore, our findings suggest that experiences with the virus do not positively relate to increased fear of the COVID-19 virus.","['COVID-19, fear learning, emotion-regulation, parent, children, parental threat communication']"

Are we more prosocial if someone is watching? Effects of animal vs. human eyes stimuli on generosity levels,"Karanusic, Ana Jelena",['Juan Olvido Perea-García'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The idea that people change their behavior when feeling observed is also known as the ‘watching eyes effect’ (Ernest-Jones, Nettle, & Bateson, 2011). This effect has made an impact on the social environment, having influenced both self-awareness, memory, appraisal of others and prosocial behavior (Conty, George, & Hietanen, 2016). Humans depend on social interaction, and since early age seek eyes as potential guide for their behavior (Vaish et al., 2017). The aim of the current study was to answer the question ‘are the prosocial effects of cues of being watched dependent on the type of eyes (stimuli) presented?’ in an online experiment. The total sample consisted of 150 participants, age range 18-67; recruited through both SONA system and snowball sampling. Data was gathered through the Qualtrics survey, assessing the participants’ nature relatedness (NR-21), with additional socio-demographics info. Although randomly assigned to one of the three conditions (animal eyes, human eyes, no eyes), each participant read the promotional description of a selected NGO Eco Systems Restoration Camps – while being exposed to eyes or no eyes – and was asked to donate out of their compensation. It was expected that exposure to both human and animal eyes, would generate significantly higher donation amounts. The analysis of variance, with NR-21 as a covariate, showed that regardless of the condition, the generosity levels did not differ. As NR-21 had a significant main effect on donations, F(1, 146) = .10.703, p = .001, it was further factored into low and high score. The second analysis found no significant interaction between the condition and the nature relatedness, F(2, 144) = 2.376, p = .097. The results shed light on the possibility of the watching eyes effect not being unique to humans, and its reference to reputational concerns. Future research could use eye-tracking devices to further explore why the subtle cues of eyes have such an impact on behavior, both human and animal.","['watching eyes effect, prosocial behavior, NR-21, reputational concern']"
The Effect of Vibro-tactile Sensations on Presence in Virtual Reality,"Schoofs, Kristin","['de Kleijn, R.', 'Toet, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Presence is the psychological state of perceiving oneself as being in the VR. Studying factors that increase presence is crucial as it increases the benefits of virtual reality training. The higher the degree of presence, the more people behave as in real life, which leads to improved skill learning. The present study examined the research question if there is an effect of vibro-tactile feedback on presence in virtual reality (VR). The hypotheses were that vibro-tactile feedback has an effect on presence and on its subscales, namely: being there, spatial presence, involvement and realness. In comparison to previous studies, this study uses vibro-tactile feedback delivered by a haptic vest, instead of force feedback. The experiment was one hour long and took place at TNO. Thirty-eight participants took part in the study. The participants were split into two conditions: the first condition received haptic feedback and the second did not receive haptic feedback. Both groups watched six 360VR videos and filled in one presence questionnaire after each video. Afterwards, the data was analysed with 5 ANCOVAs and 5 Bayesian ANCOVAs. The results showed no significant effect of vibro-tactile feedback on presence and its subscales in VR. The results highlight the importance of differentiating between vibro-tactile and haptic force feedback when studying the effect of haptic feedback on presence. Another implication is to include videos in which the participants associate sensational memory with. This indicates that the participants should have prior experience with the scenario in order to increase presence. Concluding, further studies must be conducted to clearly state that vibrotactile effect has no effect on presence.","['Presence', 'Vibro-tactile', 'Haptic-vest', 'Virtual reality']"
Stability Versus Flexibility: The Adjustment of Neural Gain in Response to Task Preparation Time.,"Smit, Juliëtte Annebel","['Steenbergen, H.', 'Jongkees, B.J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study aimed to expand on previous research regarding the stability-flexibility dilemma and the adjustment of neural gain. Specifically, it was investigated if people lower their neural gain in response to a short CSI. Previous research showed that people can adjust their neural gain based on the demand for flexibility. Specifically, lower neural gain would facilitate flexibility, but at the cost of stability. In addition, the relation between ADHD and neural gain was studied. Participants were asked to take part in a task-switching experiment in which they had to classify digits either based on parity or magnitude. Herein, the CSI duration was manipulated. Afterwards, a computational model estimated the neural gain values per condition. Participants were also asked to fill out an ADHD questionnaire. The final number of participants was 60 aged between 18 and 30. The results showed that the participants had higher switch costs and higher incongruency costs when the time to prepare was short. In addition, it was found that the participants lowered their neural gain in response to a short preparation time. Contradictory to our expectations, no relation was found between ADHD and neural gain adjustment. Together, the behavioral results and the neural gain analysis show that while lowering gain facilitates switching and thus flexibility, it also reduces focus and thus stability. For future research, it is suggested to replicate the study in a controlled environment and specifically regarding ADHD to either use a clinical sample or additional assessment tools, such as eye-tracking.","['Stability', 'flexibility', 'neural gain adjustment', 'preparation interval', 'ADHD']"
"De Inzet van Effectieve Leeractiviteiten, Groeperingsvormen en Didactische Werkvormen in het Technisch Leesonderwijs","Dam, Lillian van","['Bosch, L.J. van den']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het technisch leesonderwijs van een kwart van de Nederlandse basisscholen voldoet niet aan het basisniveau. Technisch lezen is een cruciale basisvaardigheid voor begrijpend lezen en voor het functioneren in de maatschappij. Het is daarom van belang dat wordt onderzocht hoe het technisch leesonderwijs optimaal kan worden vormgegeven. In dit onderzoek is ingegaan op de vragen: In hoeverre zijn leerkrachten bekend met de uit literatuur al dan niet effectief gebleken leeractiviteiten, groeperingsvormen en didactische werkvormen op het gebied van technisch lezen, in hoeverre passen zij deze toe in hun lessen technisch lezen en met welke van deze drie didactische aspecten valt het meeste winst te behalen ter optimalisering van het technisch leesonderwijs? Aan de hand van de literatuur zijn al dan niet effectieve didactische principes geïdentificeerd. Om te onderzoeken of de leerkrachten kennis hebben over evidence-based technisch lezen en hun lessen evidence-based vormgeven is een vragenlijst afgenomen bij 19 leerkrachten uit de midden- en bovenbouw van het basisonderwijs. Om de tijds- en kosteninvestering van het optimaliseren van het onderwijs te beperken, is middels gepaarde t-toetsen een vergelijking gemaakt tussen de inzet van effectieve leeractiviteiten, groeperingsvormen en didactische werkvormen. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat leerkrachten bekend zijn met vrijwel alle geïdentificeerde effectieve principes en deze gemiddeld genomen soms tot heel vaak inzetten in hun technisch leesonderwijs. Effectieve groeperingsvormen worden echter significant minder ingezet dan leeractiviteiten en didactische werkvormen. Door de effectieve groeperingsvormen individueel begeleid hardop lezen en tutorlezen meer in te zetten, kan het technisch leesonderwijs van de deelnemende scholen worden geoptimaliseerd.","['technisch lezen', 'basisonderwijs', 'didactiek', 'evidence-based']"

Effortful control is an important underpinning of self-regulation and plays influences developmental outcomes such as conscious development and externalizing behavior. We investigated if internalized conduct mediated the relation between parental sensitivity and effortful control in children aged 5-8. To do so, questionnaires were used to measure internalized conduct and effortful control and a parent-child drawing task was used to measure sensitive parenting. In the questionnaire for effortful, questions about the levels of effortful control of the child were answered by the primary parent. In the questionnaire for internalized conduct, questions about the levels of internalized conduct of the child were answered by the other parent. The drawing task for parental sensitivity was done by the child and the primary parent. Significant effects were found in parental sensitivity as a predictor of both internalized conduct and effortful control. In addition a significant effect was found in internalized conduct as a predictor of effortful control. However, internalized conduct was not found to be a mediator in the relation between parental sensitivity and effortful control in this study.","['developmental psychology', 'parental sensitivity', 'effortful control', 'internalized conduct', 'children', 'parents', 'psychology']"
Learning about Others: The Influence of Motivation and Gender on Behaviour Prediction in Adolescents,"Plaisier, Lotte",['Ili Ma'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"When getting to know someone, we often quickly know how this person will behave in different situations. Yet unknown is how these expectations emerge in adolescents and across gender. It is well-established that the motivation behind someone’s behaviour plays a big role in predicting that person’s behaviour. It is hypothesised that adolescents expect more greedy than risk averse behaviour, that females have a better expectation accuracy than males, that males have more accurate expectations about greedy compared to risk averse behaviour and that females have more accurate expectations about risk averse compared to greedy behaviour. To test the hypotheses, participants between 10 and 20 years old were asked to do a social prediction task. In this task they have predicted the choices of computer players whose behaviour represents a motivation in different behavioural economic paradigms. The results have not showed evidence of an effect of motivation, gender or interaction on the expectation accuracy of adolescents. However, males seem to have made slightly better predictions than females. These results suggest that neither motivation nor gender play a role in how adolescents expect others to behave. Further research is needed to identify gender differences in social skills, such as predictions about social behaviour of others.",

Since the beginning of its development, digital technology has been utilized by Indigenous people to connect, share and learn but also to advocate. Historically indigenous people have been demanding recognition and indigenous rights, and in the current digital age, this fight has partly moved to the digital sphere, on social media. Here, Indigenous people are less dependent on mainstream media and their prejudices and can spread their perspectives on their struggles and what it means to be Indigenous. I look at the political effects of this new form of activism by analyzing three different case studies. Two of the cases are located in Canada, Idle No More and MMIWG (Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls), and the third is situated in America the NoDAPL movement. These cases show that the use of social media can shift power relations between governments and Indigenous movements and that Indigenous people have more control over how they are portrayed. Though, this thesis also shows the weaknesses of using social media as a activism strategy.","['Indigenous movements', 'politics', 'social movements', 'social media activism', 'colonialism', 'indigeneity', 'power', 'settler states']"
A Comparative Approach to the Influence of the Covid-19 Pandemic on the Development of Empathy and Prosocial Giving in Adolescents Aged 15-18 Years old,"Kühner, Christin",['Kiki Zanolie'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"The Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic strongly influenced adolescents’ opportunities for real-life interactions, especially with their peers. These interactions are crucial for the development of prosocial behavior, and its predictors, such as empathic concern, perspective-taking, and opportunities for prosocial actions. We investigated the development of prosocial behavior, empathic concern, perspective-taking, and opportunities for prosocial actions in adolescents aged 15-18 years old before the pandemic (T1/T2 for the pre-pandemic group) and in those aged 15-18 years old during the pandemic (T2/T3 for the peri-pandemic group). Both groups participated in a charity dictator game a during two measurement instances. Adolescents in the pre-pandemic group showed more empathic concern, and prosocial behavior over time (T1/T2), while their perspective-taking skills remained stable, and their opportunities for prosocial behavior decreased. Adolescents in the peri-pandemic group showed more perspective-taking skills and opportunities for prosocial actions over time (T2/T3), while their empathic concern and prosocial behavior remained stable. These different developmental trajectories may point toward the importance of real-life interactions for empathic concern and prosocial behavior and the role of crisis situations in fostering perspective-taking skills. Adolescents may have sought out more opportunities for prosocial actions during the pandemic to fulfill their need to contribute to society and to belong. Moreover, gender affected the results, with girls showing more empathic concern across groups, and more prosocial behavior in the pre-pandemic group. This may be due to gender intensification and reinforcement for gender-conforming behavior. Future research should investigate the extent to which empathic concern, perspective-taking, and prosocial behavior are malleable by different circumstances and whether gender roles explicitly influence adolescents’ prosocial behavior.","['Adolescence, Covid-19, Empathy, Prosocial Giving, Dictator Game']"

Does Rumination Mediate the Relationship Between Attentional Control and Depression in University Students?,"Ozuslu, Selin Rahme","['Aksungur, S.U.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Deficits in attentional control, which is characterized as the impaired ability to engage on relevant and disengage from irrelevant stimuli, can potentially lead to clinical symptomology, such as experiencing symptoms of depression. Rumination refers to repetitive thinking about negative thoughts and feelings, and it was found to be one of the mediating factors for the empirically supported relationship between low attentional control and higher depressive symptomatology. In the current study, this relationship was investigated in an emerging adulthood population considering most mental disorders having their onset during late adolescence and the developmental changes faced by adolescents during this time period. 49 university students completed a set of questionnaires through the online participant recruitment platform SONA of Leiden University. The results demonstrated that the respondents who had low levels of self-reported attentional control reported higher depressive symptoms and this relationship was mediated via rumination. However, when the indirect effect was bootstrapped, this relationship was found to be insignificant. These findings underline the importance of the potential role of attentional control and rumination play in depressive symptomatology. Thus, further replication and examination of the relationship between attentional control and depression via rumination in an emerging adulthood perspective could strengthen our understanding of the transdiagnostic mechanism in depressive disorders.","['Attentional control, Rumination, Depression, Mediation, Emerging Adulthood']"
Challenging lockdown or not? The mediated effects of anti-lockdown attitudes on the voting behaviour of voters of populist radical right parties,"Bakker, Lieke","['Otjes, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"What happens when populist radical right parties (PRRPs) adopt an anti-lockdown stance? PRRPs in Western Europe, which in ideology are mostly comparable, have been divided on the issue of COVID-19. The answer does not follow automatically from their economic, cultural or anti-elitist positions, which all seem to advocate for a different strategy. In some countries, such as the Netherlands, two PRRPs have each taken a different approach: one became an anti-lockdown party, the other did not. In this study the effects of becoming an anti-lockdown party on their voter base, who either vote for economic, cultural or anti-elitist reasons, have been examined using a mediation analysis on existing panel data. This study concludes that voters, who mostly vote because they agree with the PRRPs cultural right-wing positions, might be dissuaded to vote for a PRRP that has become an anti-lockdown party. However, anti-lockdown attitudes most strongly positively affect voting for an anti-lockdown party on their own and appear to tap into a new voter base. Future research is needed in order to corroborate this finding.","['PRRP', 'populist radical right parties', 'anti-lockdown party', 'anti-lockdown attitudes', 'economic rightwing attitudes', 'cultural rightwing attitudes', 'COVID-19', 'FvD', 'PVV', 'mediation analysis']"
Thematic Analysis of Autobiographical Dissociation Scripts in Borderline Personality Disorder,"Hughes, Natasha","['Krause, A.D.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Dissociation is a complex trans-diagnostic phenomenon, which ranges from normative to pathological. There are multiple ways of measuring and categorising dissociation, and different theories as to the aetiology and function of dissociation in psychological disorders. People with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) experience more dissociation than healthy controls and other personality disorders, and dissociation is associated with other key features of BPD. Despite this, dissociation in BPD is poorly understood. It is unclear which types of dissociation manifest in BPD, in which situations, and the function that dissociation achieves. The aim of this study was to investigate the form and function of dissociation in BPD, by identifying themes across personal narratives. A thematic analysis was performed on narratives of dissociative experiences assessed within a script-driven imagery approach. The predominant forms of dissociation were depersonalisation and derealisation. Dissociation occurred in interpersonal and threatening situations, tended to follow negative affect, and was accompanied by physical reactions consistent with sympathetic nervous system activation. Dissociation functioned as psychological escape from internal experiences or external situations. These themes are discussed within the context of prominent theories of BPD and dissociation. These findings are in line with the idea that dissociation in BPD acts as a protective mechanism against high sensitivity and reactivity to affective and interpersonal experiences in the place of normative regulation skills. This paper concludes that dissociation in BPD offers psychological escape from intolerable experiences, and is related to a low threshold for threat perception and threat response mobilisation.","['Borderline Personality Disorder', 'BPD', 'dissociation', 'thematic analysis']"
Socio-emotional factors associated with peer preference in preschool-aged children,"Basdeki, Athanasia-Maria","['Rieffe, C.J.', 'De Sousa da Silva, B.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"A majority of research in social sciences has been focused on peer preference throughout childhood and adolescence. Different factors have been found to be related to peer preference such as emotion recognition, empathy, and prosocial behavior. In addition, prior research has shown possible sex differences regarding peer preference and the mechanisms and factors that influence how girls and boys choose which peers they prefer. In the present study participated 135 normally developing preschoolers, aged three to five, from different areas of Portugal, with the aim to investigate the socio-emotional factors that are related to peer preference. In detail, data for peer preference were gathered through the use of peer nomination techniques. Data on emotion recognition, empathy, and prosocial behavior- the social-emotional factors in this research- were gathered with parent questionnaires. The results were not as expected, as there were no correlations found between peer preference with empathy and prosocial behavior in the sample. However, a small negative correlation was found between peer preference and emotion recognition. Furthermore, none of the three factors could predict peer preference. Lastly, there were no significant differences between boys and girls regarding the relationship of preference with emotion recognition, empathy, and prosocial behavior. There is a possibility that the results were unexpected as the measuring techniques that were used were inappropriate for the variables that needed to be measured. Additionally, the cognitive and emotional level of preschoolers might not be yet advanced to the degree that is required to demonstrate empathy and prosocial behavior at a level that will influence the formation of peer preference. Still, peer preference during preschool years is of the utmost importance as it influences not only the present developmental level but also the future socio-emotional development of children.","['Peer preference', 'preschool', 'empathy', 'emotion recognition', 'prosocial behavior', 'sex differences']"

In order to have a better understanding of these dynamics, this study analyses the relationship between Sense of Presence and interaction with VR environments in relation to certain personal characteristics such as personality type and mental rotation ability. For this purpose, 22 participants are recruited to experience the presented virtual environment. They are able to interact with certain objects within it, for example by lifting them up and throwing them around. Each interaction is counted and their answers on the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI), Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) and a Mental Rotation task are measured. A correlational design is used and scores are analysed by means of multiple linear regression models. Results show no significant effects for any of the factors after correcting for multiple testing, however Neuroticism shows a positive pattern for Spatial Presence (p<.05) and Mental Rotation demonstrates a possible positive relation with Realism (p<.05). In conclusion, it is postulated that personal characteristics might play a role in feelings of presence in virtual spaces, however due to limited power and other methodological factors, significance was not reached. In alignment with our aim, this study aids in enriching the scarce literature that is currently available by presenting its own results and by further offering interesting clues for future research into the relationship (neuro)-psychological factors might have with our experiences of VR.","['VR', 'personality', 'mental rotation', 'sense of presence', 'interaction', 'immersion', 'virtual reality']"

Understanding which job demands influence burnout complaints and which job resources moderate these negative effects can help reduce burnout in physicians. This study also compares the three largest occupational groups in the sample (municipal health care doctors, psychiatry, hospital physicians) on the experienced job demands and resources. All participants filled out several validated questionnaires (including the Burnout Assessment Tool) about their job demands, job resources and burnout symptoms. Regression analyses revealed time pressure and work-family conflict as significant predictors. There was a negative effect of the job resources developmental opportunities, role clarity, and internal communication on burnout. A moderation analysis revealed a moderating relationship between staff availability and work-family conflicts: when there was less staff, and high work-family conflict, burnout complaints were highest. Surprisingly, the analysis also revealed that high appreciation and high time pressure led to higher burnout complaints. The occupational subgroups were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of variance. They did not differ in burnout levels, but out of the three groups, hospital physicians experienced the most demands and fewest resources. Job demands and resources differ per subgroup, but have the same effect on burnout. Future research should investigate the role of resources in regard to work engagement and the role of high appreciation on burnout complaints. Interventions increasing job resources and decreasing job demands should be developed to improve physician wellbeing.","['physician burnout, medicine burnout, burnout, Burnout Assessment Tool, Job-Demands Resources Model, occupational stress, job demands']"

The Parliamentary Personnel Puzzle: Disentangling the Drivers of Parliamentary Staff Size Across the World,"Hofland, Daan","['Otjes, S.P.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Recent advisory reports on the Dutch parliamentary system, public scrutiny, and parliamentary upheaval following transgressive behaviour by the old speaker of parliament have drawn attention to the functioning of parliamentary administrations. The support staff of parliaments is a scarcely covered topic in political science. In a new body of literature, this article is only the second to examine parliamentary staff size quantitatively. It fundamentally extends the scope of previous research from western democracies to a much broader population of parliaments. Drawing on both a functionalist and an institutionalist framework, it hypothesises that population size, population non-linearity, clientelism, parliamentary competition, an interaction between clientelism and parliamentary competition, parliamentary culture, and institutional isomorphism influence the number of institutional and committee staff in parliaments. This research uses house-level data from 161 countries over ten years and employs multilevel analysis to test these hypotheses. It finds strong support that population size, population size non-linearity, and institutional isomorphism influence staff size, while it finds mixed support for parliamentary competition as a predictor of staff size. There was no support for parliamentary culture, clientelism, and the clientelism-competition interaction hypotheses. Additionally, previously thought insignificant predictors of staff size, such as assembly size and parliamentary powers, were, in fact, significant. This article is the first to look at parliamentary administrations, which are vital to the functioning of primary democratic institutions, from a global perspective. Due to the mixed results, it calls for more extensive research on different types of staff, further disentangling of the mechanisms posited, and further data collection to progress understanding of this veiled political and administrative institution.","['parliamentary administration', 'parliamentary staff', 'clientelism', 'functionalism', 'institutionalism', 'parliament', 'party competition', 'parliamentary culture']"

I wanted to achieve predictive invariant prediction and recognize variables where predictive invariance (PI) of linear regression across groups held. Method: Simulation study: I applied LASSO and MCP penalization methods to penalize intercepts, slopes, and their group differences towards zero. Simulation factors included sample size, PI-status of intercept, and number of PI-slopes. The goal was to correctly recognize the PI-status of intercepts and slopes. Outcomes such as proportion of correctly identified PI-status of parameters as well as sensitivity and specificity were inspected. Empirical study: Life Satisfaction was predicted from 11 separate predictors. Sex was used as a grouping variable. LASSO and MCP were used to penalize slopes as well as their difference between groups. Results: PI intercepts are more often recognized compared to Not PI intercepts. The most influential factors are 1) number of coefficients in the model with the same PI-status and 2) sample size. MCP is found to be more accurate than LASSO in recognizing PI slopes and intercepts. The opposite is true for the recognition of Not PI coefficients. Conclusion: The methods can be used improve the fairness of predictions with respect to groups.","['Predictive Invariance, Multi-Group Multiple Regression, Penalizing group differences.']"
Simulating Anticipatory Centering Behavior in a Robotic Sequential Reaching Task using Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Sinttruije, Deborah van","['de Kleijn, R.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Humans use inferred statistical properties of sequential events to smoothen subsequent actions by anticipatory movements. These anticipatory movements have been studied in the serial reaction time (SRT) task, in which participants anticipate the target stimuli in learned sequences, however, under uncertainty, the participants seem to adhere to a centering strategy. It remains unclear whether this centering behavior is a statistically inferred way to compensate for the absence of sequence knowledge, using the center as an optimal anticipatory position. In this study, two state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) algorithms (Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) & Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)) are compared and employed to train artificial agents to investigate the scope of centering behavior, by manipulating the frequency distributions of target stimuli. While SAC evidently outperformed PPO in terms of performance and stability, both algorithms displayed an effect of frequency distribution on centering position. Specifically, a proportional shift toward more probable target stimuli, suggesting that centering behavior is indeed anticipatory behavior as a way to compensate for the absence of explicit sequence knowledge.","['Sequential actions', 'sequential decision making', 'statistical learning', 'anticipatory behavior', 'Reinforcement learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'PPO', 'SAC']"

Using multiple regression test, a between-subject experiment (N = 290) was conducted by comparing participants’ financial avoidance of financial information that was structured or not in two different tasks, general and specific mail. Result showed that financial scarcity positively associated with financial avoidance, but the structure manipulation we designed had no impact on lowering financial avoidance among those with financial scarcity.

Fifteen DHH children aged 8 – 13 years and 249 hearing peers aged 8 – 14 years participated in the study. 9 out of 13 participating classes included a DHH child. Social inclusion was measured by 4 measures: through self-reports of loneliness (total scores and two subdimensions: group integration and peer intimacy), peer nominations, teacher reports for social participation and parent reports for peer problems. Attitudes towards children with disabilities, self-compassion and sense of coherence were measured through self-reports. The results indicated that DHH and hearing children were similar in their peer acceptance and group integration, but differences occurred in loneliness and levels of intimacy in particular. No significant associations were found for class mean scores of attitudes towards children withdisabilities, self-compassion or sense of coherence and social inclusion measures. When peer nominations were examined, self-attitudes towards children with disabilities, self-compassion and sense of coherence showed no difference between peers who did and did not nominate DHH children as their friend. Regression analyses showed that girls had better self-attitudes than boys and higher levels of self-compassion predicted better self-attitudes. Furthermore, younger children expected more positive attitudes of classmates toward children with disabilities. Higher levels of sense of coherence were also a predictor of more positive attitudes of classmates.","['Social inclusion', 'social participation', 'deaf and hard-of-hearing', 'DHH', 'attitudes towards children with disabilities', 'Self-compassion, sense of coherence']"

Eyes don't lie: Does Perceived Attractiveness Mediate the Relationship between Pupil Size and Lying?,"Wahl, Jasmin Deborah Eva","['Diana, F.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Dilated compared to constricted pupils have been found to increase several prosocial behaviors and impressions in interaction partners, including trust decisions, as well as ratings of friendliness and attractiveness. Dilated pupils have also been found to decrease lying in a coin-toss game where lying harmed the other person. It has been suggested that this decrease in lying might be caused by enhanced social bonding. Since increased attractiveness has also been linked to enhanced social bonding, this study investigated, whether perceived attractiveness mediates the relationship between pupil size and lying. To investigate this, a coin-toss game has been used where the participants were asked to make private predictions about the outcome of a coin-toss. They were then asked whether or not their predictions were correct. For each correct prediction, they earned some money, and their interaction partner lost some money. For each incorrect prediction, only their partner earned some money. The passive interaction partner was a confederate wearing contact lenses with either dilated or constricted pupils. After this coin-toss game, they were asked to rate their interaction partner’s attractiveness. The relationship between pupil size and lying, as well as the mediation of attractiveness, were found to be non-significant. Therefore, attractiveness does not seem to mediate the relationship between pupil size and lying. These results do not fit earlier findings. A number of possible explanations are suggested for the unexpected results. However, more research is needed to investigate these suggestions and to fully understand the effect of pupil size on lying.","['pupil size', 'lying', 'attractiveness', 'coin-toss game', 'prosocial behavior', 'nonverbal communication']"

Stability of Exact Tree,"Uysal, Samil",['Elise Dusseldorp'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The stability of statistical methods is closely tied to the reliability of scientific research, and guarantees consistent and reproducible interpretation of results from statistical analyses. A statistical method is stable when it produces identical or similar results, when the method is used for different samples of the same population, or different datasets from the same data generating process. Stability measures can be divided into semantic stability and structural stability. Semantic stability describes the similarity in predicted outcome of two analyses, while structural stability is the similarity in the structural elements of two analyses. A widely used statistical learning method known for poor stability is decision tree algorithms, of which many have so called “greedy” forward searching algorithms that are locally optimizing. In the past decade however, globally optimizing decision trees have been developed, like Evolutionary Tree and Exact Tree. To our knowledge, no study has been conducted assessing the stability of globally optimizing decision trees, and comparing them to that of locally optimizing trees. A benchmark study was conducted to compare the stabilities of three decision tree algorithms. These were the globally optimizing Exact Tree and Evolutionary Tree, and the locally optimizing Classification and Regression Tree (CART). The differences between the methods were evaluated with four different semantic stability measures, and one structural stability measure. Four different benchmark datasets (Abalone, Boston Housing, Breastcancer, Ionosphere) were used for the benchmark study. The continuous predictor variables in these datasets with more than 30 unique values had to be discretized before the Exact Tree approach could be applied in order for it to run. The results showed that CART was overall the more stable method among the three, with Exact Tree and Evolutionary Tree showing marginal to small differences. There were no significant differences in stability between the methods found for the Breastcancer, for which no predictors were discretized. A considerable interaction effect was found however between type of dataset and method for structural stability. The greatest differences between methods were found for the Ionosphere data, which was also the dataset for which Exact Tree discretized the most predictor variables. It was also found that compared to CART, the globally optimizing decision tree methods created larger trees, which suggests that overfitting is a larger problem for these methods than for CART. This might be due to a difference in implementations of the algorithms, since CART produced trees that did not seem to adhere to the stopping criteria set by the hyperparameters, and possibly pruned the trees it created. A worthwhile direction for future research could be comparing the methods based on pruned trees.","['Decision Tree', 'Exact Tree', 'Stability', 'Benchmark Study']"

Participants were 423 native Spanish speakers divided into 3 conditions where they answered a survey that included a section with plural nouns in one of the grammatical forms and participants provided names of people who they could be referring to, the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), and a political ideology scale. Results show a statistically significant difference in male bias between conditions and between genders. Men had a higher male bias than women across all conditions. Male participants presented a higher male bias in the masculine generic form than in the neutral and dual forms, and in the neutral form compared to the dual form. Female participants showed a higher male bias in the masculine generic form than in the neutral and dual forms, but there was no difference between the neutral and dual forms. These results suggest that the dual form is the only generic plural form in which there’s a lower gender bias for men, while the neutral form also shows a lower gender bias for women. This highlights the importance of inclusive language, which is often deemed unnecessary by the government and institutions of the Spanish language.","['gender bias, grammatical gender, Spanish, ambivalent sexism, political ideology']"

Executive Functioning and the Effect of Distracted Consumption on Body Weight,"Walrave, Renske","['van Meer, A.F.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"During recent decades obesity and overweight developed into a worldwide health problem. This has heightened the need for insight into dietary habits related to obesity. Recent research shows that distracted consumption is associated with an increased Body Mass Index (BMI), stressing the need for a better understanding of the relationship between body weight and distracted consumption and the prevalence of distracted consumption. Thereby, this study investigates the role of executive functioning (EF) on the relationship between distracted consumption and BMI. Data from 135 individuals (>16 years, 103F, BMI 14.4 – 49.2) was gathered through an online questionnaire including the Adult Executive Functions Inventory (ADEXI). The most reported distractions during consumption are talking to others (28%) and smartphone use (27%). Only 11.8% of the respondents reported no distraction during mealtime. To examine the relationship between distracted consumption and BMI, a linear regression analysis was performed which showed no significant relationship. To investigate the effect of EF on the relationship between BMI and distracted consumption, a multiple linear regression analysis was performed which showed no significant effect of EF. Exploratory results did show a negative trend between working memory (WM) and distracted consumption: distracted eating increased when WM ability decreased. In conclusion, this study does not confirm a relationship between distracted consumption and BMI or provide evidence for the effect of EF on this relationship. However, exploratory analyses indicate a negative trend between WM and distracted consumption. These findings provide a basis for further research on distracted consumption and the role of WM.",

Therapist Facilitative Interpersonal Skills as a Predictor of Treatment Outcome: Understanding Potential Moderators,"Gajic, Milica","['Jong, K. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"It is well established that therapists show different levels of effectiveness irrespective of the treatment provided, but less is known about the therapists’ characteristics that contribute to better treatment outcomes. Therapists’ facilitative interpersonal skills (FIS) were found to predict therapeutic alliance and treatment outcomes. However, no research up to date has examined any moderating factors of the relationship between therapists’ FIS and therapy outcomes. The present study aims to investigate whether therapists’ FIS predict clinical outcomes in a sample of 93 CBT therapists from two Dutch mental healthcare institutions. Moreover, it seeks to examine whether the relationship between therapists’ FIS and clinical outcomes is moderated by 1) the difficulty of therapy situation; 2) the severity of clients’ symptoms; and 3) organizational context. This cross-sectional study uses a randomized, within-subjects, counterbalanced design. Therapists’ FIS were measured using FIS performance task during which participants responded to the client in simulated therapy sessions consisting of either challenging or benign therapy fragments. Their responses were rated on eight domains of FIS task. Clinical outcomes were measured using 48-item Symptom Questionnaire. Multilevel analysis was used to analyze the data. Results indicated that therapists’ FIS did not predict clinical outcomes in the present sample. There were no significant associations between FIS and clinical outcomes in either challenging or benign therapy situations. The severity of clients’ symptoms did not moderate the association between FIS and clinical outcomes. These findings might more accurately represent the role of FIS in clinical practice and have important implications for therapist training.","['facilitative interpersonal skills (FIS)', 'therapist effects', 'clinical outcomes', 'CBT therapists']"

We zien in het dagelijks leven echter ook dat de mate waarin mensen exploreren verschilt en dat het exploreren van nieuwe omgevingen stress kan oproepen. Wat we niet weten is of het ontdekkingsgedrag in een nieuwe omgeving wordt beïnvloed door een staat van hoge stress, of dit stresseffect gedurende een langere tijd aanwezig blijft en of daarbij man-vrouw verschillen een rol spelen. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat de sing-a-song stresstest een significant effect heeft op de subjectieve stress. Daarnaast laten we zien dat sekse wel invloed heeft op het ontdekken van nieuwe omgevingen. We hebben gevonden dat mannen gemiddeld meer afstand afleggen tijdens het ontdekken van nieuwe omgevingen dan de gemiddelde afstand die vrouwen afleggen tijdens het ontdekken. Er is geen bewijs gevonden dat stress hier invloed op heeft. Onze resultaten laten zien dat mannen en vrouwen op verschillende manieren omgaan met nieuwe omgevingen. Verwacht wordt dat dit onderzoek van invloed kan zijn op het diagnosticeren van depressie en het behandelen van de manische symptomen van de bipolaire stoornis. In toekomstig onderzoek kan gekeken worden naar hoe de ontdekking van nieuwe omgevingen onder continue stress plaatsvindt.

The Influence of Stress and Personality Type - Extroversion and Introversion - on Exploration Behavior,"Sekerci, Ceyda","['Schomaker, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Exploration behaviour is essential in becoming familiar with one’s environment and is necessary to survive in life-threatening situations. Previous studies found that stress negatively affects exploration behaviour and introverts are more stress-prone than extroverts. Moreover, high levels of extroversion are positively related to explorative behaviour. However, no study focused on whether the effects of stress on explorative behaviour differ between introverts and extroverts. The current study hypothesised that extroversion and stress correlate since previous studies found this correlation. It is also hypothesised that introverts will explore less than extroverts in low- and high-stress conditions. To test this, 51 participants were recruited and assigned to the high- or low-stress condition through the counterbalance method. Participants in the high-stress condition were asked to sing a song (known as the Sing-a-Song Stress Test (SSST)), and participants in the low-stress condition were asked to listen to a song. During the SSST, an eye tracker was used to measure arousal. Hereafter, participants explored a VR environment, carried out the Landmark test and filled in questionnaires. Results indicated that the SSST caused stress among our participants in both conditions. No correlation was found between the stress groups and personality type extroversion and introversion, nor exist significant effects of personality and stress on exploration behaviour. It is advised that future research includes a larger number of subgroups and considers all the individual variables underlying exploration behaviour to get insights into the relationship between stress and personality type on exploration behaviour.","['exploration behaviour, distance travelled, roaming entropy, step length, stress, Sing-a-Song Stress Test, extroversion, introversion']"

Two of the most common skin diseases are atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, which are both illnesses affected by itch. Itch is often seen as the most bothersome characteristic since there is no oral anti-itch medication. Itch is also negatively affected by psychological characteristics such as anxiety and catastrophizing. As itch is similar to pain, it was hypothesised that anxiety would increase catastrophizing about itch in patients with chronic itch, the same as it does in patients with chronic pain. To test this hypothesis, 11 patients with a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis or psoriasis were recruited. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale were completed. Data was analysed using simple linear regression. There was no effect of anxiety on catastrophizing within the participants, which means that catastrophizing was not predicted by anxiety. This could be due to an unwillingness to participate from patients with more itch, or the need for another moderator influencing anxiety and/or catastrophizing.",

Participants were presented with one of four sponsorship disclosure symbols on a mock-up website, on which they chose a hotel. Further, recognition of sponsorship disclosures, as well as fairness perceptions and purchase intention, were assessed. Results showed that more prominent and clearer symbols led to increased recognition of sponsorship disclosure. Significant decreases in purchase intention and fairness perceptions were found for disclosing sponsorship to participants after choosing a hotel.

Emotional maltreatment in childhood has been found to be associated with the development of depressive disorder later in life. Mental health problems often originate during adolescence, which is a period when important perceptions of the self are developing, including a person's various self-aspects. The purpose of this study was to examine whether emotional child maltreatment is related to the degree of adolescent self-expression toward others. We also examined a possible mediation effect of the degree of expression between emotional maltreatment and the degree of depressive symptoms. Adolescents (n = 115) were required to complete self-report questionnaires related to the extent of depressive symptoms (PHQ) and emotional childhood maltreatment (JTV). Current study looked at the relation between the questionnaires and the number of characters used to describe themselves towards others (Profieltaak). The study found that emotional childhood maltreatment was positively associated with the degree of depressive symptoms. However, it also showed that there was no association between self-descriptions and the degree of depressive symptoms or self-descriptions and emotional child maltreatment and hence no mediation effect of a person's self-aspect. The current research partly shows results that are inconsistent with previous studies, this can be possibly explained by the fact that the concept of self-aspects has not been examined this way before. The current study only looked at the correlation crossectionally, future research could focus on the causal relationship between depressive symptoms and self-aspects, which may be useful developing treatments.","['Adolescence, Depression, self-aspect, Emotional childhood maltreatment, self-concept']"

The minority stress model identified possible variables that lead to mental distress in the sexual minority population. Various positive aspects on the contrary like resilience and mental flexibility might support SM’s psychological wellbeing. Within the framework of relational cultural theory, which states that striving for beneficial interpersonal connection is essential for growth and wellbeing, these variables might have a potential influence in reshaping SM’s relationships to others and thus, amending overall wellbeing. The aim of this study was to observe the effects and its interaction of resilience and psychological flexibility on wellbeing in order to potentially substantiate the consequences it might have on social aspects of SMI. It was hypothesized that resilience would exert a significant positive effect on wellbeing and further, a positive partial or full mediation through mental flexibility would be observed in this study. A secondary data analysis from 345 participants and three questionnaires was conducted: the Brief Resilience Scale, the Multidimensional Psychological Flexibility Inventory and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire Short- Form . A regression- and mediation analysis was conducted. The results demonstrated a significant total effect of resilience on wellbeing. Resilience significantly predicted wellbeing (β= .31, p< .001). An indirect effect and a partial mediation effect of psychological flexibility between resilience and wellbeing was furthermore observed. All results were in line with the hypotheses. The combined effects of resilience and mental flexibility on wellbeing in SMI were evident in this study which is in line with previous literature. Thus, they might be important mental components in dealing with adversity in SM as (consciously) ameliorating views into a constructive direction on relational situations and thus strengthening resilience through incremental social support might finally yield the desired benefits that SMI often still lack despite growing awareness of the general state of wellbeing.","['sexual minorities', 'resilience', 'psychological flexibility', 'mental flexibility', 'wellbeing', 'lgbtqia']"

The Effect of Environmental Novelty on Verbal and Landmark Memory in Human Development,"Pihlaja, Rea","['Schomaker, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The ability to perceive novelty in the surrounding environment and memorize the changes has been crucial for all species throughout evolution. Exploring novel environments induces memory consolidation mechanisms and may facilitate consolidating even weakly encoded, unrelated events into long-term memory. Based on animal studies, exposure to novelty activates dopaminergic neuronal networks and, thus, the memory consolidation mechanisms. These networks mature and deteriorate throughout human development, but the consequences to environmental novelty-related responses in memory are still unknown. This study examined the effects of environmental novelty on verbal and landmark memory in different ages throughout human development. In the present study, participants (n = 439) in different age groups explored novel or familiar VR environments in two exploration rounds, with landmarks presented on the second round. Simultaneously, their paths in the VR environment were constantly tracked. Afterwards, words were introduced during a deep or shallow encoding task, and the level of the memory performance for recalling words and recognizing words and landmarks was measured. As expected, adolescents and young adults benefited more from environmental novelty on word recall and recognition than children or older adults. The words were recalled better after an exposure to a novel rather than to a familiar environment and in deep rather than in shallow learning conditions. In general, novelty did not interact with age or learning condition, except slightly in recognition task. In deep learning, younger adults benefited significantly more from novelty than children. In shallow learning, adolescents benefited significantly more from novelty than older adults or children. Landmarks were recognized better in a familiar rather than novel environment, and adolescents and younger adults recognized more landmarks than other age groups. The tendency to explore novel paths instead of familiar ones predicted the level of word and landmark recognition, but not for word recall. Older age was not associated with a reduced tendency to explore novel paths. As a conclusion, younger individuals benefit more from environmental novelty than older adults, who generally show novelty detriment – this is in line with the developmental changes in the dopaminergic system.","['environmental novelty, age, word recall, word recognition, landmark memory']"

Our aim was to investigate the relation of COVID-19 with cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, fentanyl, heroin and methamphetamine use. Method: Systematic review and meta-analyses. Databases were searched until April 2nd 2021 Results: For cannabis use, two analyses were performed based on the type of data. An increase in the number of cannabis users was found during COVID-19 (k = 8, N = 4814, Z = 2.12, p = 0.034). No difference was found in the amount of cannabis used at the two different time points (k = 5, N = 1165, p = 0.110). There were no significant changes found in hard drug use during the COVID-19 pandemic relative to before its restrictions; cocaine (k = 10, N = 1193293‬, p = 0.121), amphetamine (k = 3, N = 387973, p = 0.982), fentanyl (k = 3, N = 1189864, p = 0.065), heroin (k = 4, N = 1138243, p = 0.438) and methamphetamine (k = 5, N = 387973, p = 0.134). Conclusion: There is evidence that COVID-19 is associated with a small increase in the number of cannabis users. We found no evidence for an increase in the amount of cannabis used or the number of hard drug users before and during COVID-19. Consequently, in the clinical field of psychology, it might be better to invest more (of the limited) resources in alleviating mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, feelings of isolation and stress as opposed to problems with substance (ab)use, which showed to be less reactive than initially imagined.",

The effect of a sensorimotor intervention on frailty and brain correlates,"Drotos, Svenya Christina","['Root, N. B.', 'Beier, F.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Frailty, an age-related decline in multiple physiological systems, increases risks to adverse health outcomes and mortality and is characterized by accelerated processes also seen in non-pathological ageing. According to neuroscientific models, a loss of sensorimotor stimulation due to degraded sensory input, and central processing deficits result in the development of maladaptive plasticity. To stop or reverse the underlying correlates of maladaptive plasticity, a tablet-based at-home sensorimotor training was administered to 48 frail German older adults. Pre-intervention, severity of frailty was assessed using the frailty phenotype framework as well as the Deficit Accumulation model. A reduced number of participants also had an MRI (n = 22) and fMRI (n = 18) scan done to assess regional gray matter volume and intra-network functional connectivity, respectively. Following randomization, the experimental group (n = 24) trained on unimodal and bimodal sensory discrimination tasks in the visual, auditory, and tactile domain. The control group (n = 24) engaged in an app-based relaxation training. After 60 days of training, both groups were reassessed on the above parameters. Results indicated that the sensorimotor intervention had a tendency towards an effect on frailty as assessed using the frailty phenotype model (p = .058). Furthermore, in the experimental group, gray matter volume decline in the precentral gyrus halted compared to the control condition (p = .007). As such, this result provides preliminary evidence that a neuroplasticity-oriented approach to targeting frailty could be of merit. This thesis underlines the importance of using longitudinal data to establish causality in the research on frailty and signposts the need to assess relationships between brain and frailty as an entity in its whole, beyond its subcomponents.","['Frailty', 'Neuroplasticity', 'Training', 'Sensorimotor functioning', 'Aging']"
Effect van de werkgeheugencapaciteit op eetgedrag en BMI: Resultaten van een moderatie analyse,"Kempenaar, Ilse",['A. F. van Meer'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In de afgelopen decennia is de prevalentie van overgewicht en obesitas toegenomen tot een wereldwijd gezondheidsprobleem. Om die reden is het belangrijk om onderzoek te doen naar de achterliggende redenen. Door de recente ontwikkelingen kunnen mensen altijd en overal eten en drinken terwijl ze zichzelf actief of passief bezighouden met andere activiteiten. Recent onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat regelmatig afgeleid eten kan leiden tot herhaaldelijke overconsumptie, wat kan leiden tot een verhoogd BMI. Een mogelijke oorzaak hiervoor is een beperkte ruimte in de werkgeheugencapaciteit. Een verminderde werkgeheugencapaciteit kan leiden tot het meer consumeren van voedsel, waardoor het werkgeheugencapaciteit effect zou kunnen hebben op BMI. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om het effect van werkgeheugencapaciteit op de relatie afgeleid eten en BMI te onderzoeken. Hiervoor is een moderatie regressieanalyse uitgevoerd. Een online vragenlijst is beantwoord door 135 deelnemers (16-59 jaar, gemiddelde leeftijd =25,61, 103 vrouwen, BMI 14,4-49,2). Er is gebruikt gemaakt van de Stroop taak als maat voor werkgeheugencapaciteit. De meeste gemelde afleidingen waren praten met anderen en smartphone gebruik. Er kon geen significante relatie tussen afgeleid eten en BMI worden aangetoond. Ook is er geen significant verband van de werkgeheugencapaciteit op de relatie afgeleid eten en BMI gevonden. Een reden voor het niet vinden van deze effecten kan het gevolg zijn van te weinig spreiding in de leeftijd van de deelnemers. Aangezien geraadpleegde literatuur het tegenovergestelde vond, is een vervolgonderzoek met een aangepaste methode belangrijk om de effecten van de werkgeheugencapaciteit op afgeleid eten te bepalen.",
Why Granny's Estate Is Not Yours: Justifying An Inheritance Tax From A Libertarian Perspective.,"Le Goff, Corentine, Léa","['Daemen, J.A.M']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Many of us, in liberal societies, hold the practice of inheritance to be sacrosanct, and attempts to tax wealth transfers from one generation to the next are, therefore, are often viewed negatively. In fact, it is often quickly assumed that the right to bequeath is entailed by the possession of a property title. Rather unsurprisingly, then, many on the right fringes of the libertarian school —i.e. the philosophical tradition dedicated to justifying strong property rights par excellence— have argued that an inheritance tax cannot be justified. Nonetheless, others working within a left-libertarian framework have also made great strides in challenging the assumption that a right to bequeath is an integral part of private property rights. Working from these insights on the impermissibility of bequest, and emphasizing the autonomy-conferring purpose of property rights, this thesis argues in favor of the justifiability of inheritance taxation. Indeed, the crux of this essay revolves around the contention that libertarian authors fail to acknowledge autonomy as the rationale that grounds the bundle of rights which they defend, which makes them more easily oblivious to the fundamentally objectionable nature of a supposed “right” to bequeath. Furthermore, it is this right to autonomous living which ultimately predicates the justifiability of an inheritance tax as representing enforceable claims to the practice of private property.","['libertarianism', 'inheritance tax', 'bequest', 'property rights']"
The Discrepancy Between High Expectations and Self-perception in Perfectionism: Its Effect on Social Learning and Theta Power Oscillations,"Narbutaitė, Rugilė","['Molen, M. van der']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Maladaptive perfectionism is characterized by high standards and the perception that own performance does not meet these expectations, the discrepancy in perfectionism. It is often accompanied by fear of negative evaluation and instable self-esteem. This study used a SELF- speech task and looked at the discrepancy trait of perfectionism specifically to examine how individuals with this trait update their feelings about the self, with the expectation that they would show a negativity bias. Additionally, it was hypothesized that these individuals would show differences in brain activity (mid-frontal theta oscillations) caused by negative feedback. Ninety-five participants, out of which fifty-two were in the high discrepancy group, gave a speech about themselves and received positive and negative feedback about their performance. Results of this study show that individuals learn differently from negative and positive feedback. More specifically, both groups showed a positivity bias indicating that they update their feelings about the self more after receiving positive than negative feedback. Differently than expected, the high discrepancy group did not show negativity bias and had learning rates similar to the low discrepancy group. This study also found that theta power activity was not correlated to the mismatch or valence of the feedback received after the task. Furthermore, no group differences in theta power activity were found. These findings indicate that the discrepancy between one’s expectations and self-perception is not related to a negativity bias or increased mid-frontal theta power oscillations. Future research should focus on other classifications of perfectionism to confirm these findings.","['discrepancy', 'learning bias', 'negative feedback', 'perfectionism', 'theta power']"
Radical Right Populist Parties and Ukrainian Refugees – Unitary discourses or a fragmentation of positions?,"Loos, Chanel de",['Dr. Katharina Natter'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines the reaction of 16 European radical-right populist (RRP) parties toward Ukrainian refugees. Since the war in Ukraine only started in February 2022, a systematic overview of the reaction of these RRP parties, normally known for their anti-immigration stance, has not yet been conducted. The thesis asks: To what extent and how did Radical Right Populist parties change their discourses in their anti-immigration position when the war started in Ukraine? The thesis analyses party discourses on refugees, comparing the discourses on Ukrainian refugees, found in press releases on the parties’ websites or social media, with the parties’ position before, gained from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey dataset. The analysis reveals that European RRP parties can be divided into four categories depending on whether they kept their position on refugees, totally changed their position when it comes to Ukrainian refugees, or adopted an intermediate position. The extent of this shift is related to the groups’ view of a multicultural society, their Eurosceptic position, and their relationship with Russia. Geographical and cultural proximity are shown to be an important factor as well. Ultimately, even though RRP parties can be considered as one political family that shares many characteristics, their reaction toward Ukrainian refugees varies more than would be expected given one of their core features: anti-immigration.",

De Relatie tussen Intelligentie en Psychopathie: Moderatie door Antisociale Gedragsstoornis,"Bruin, Elize de","['Linting, M.', 'Maas, J.N.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Recent research focuses on understanding the relationship between intelligence and psychopathy. However, many inconsistent results are found. On top of that, the information on how individuals with psychopathy could be helped optimally, is still limited. The current study investigated the relationship between intelligence and the three domains of psychopathy: the affective, interpersonal, and behavioral dimension. A second topic of interest was the possible moderation effect of conduct disorder on the relationship between intelligence and the three dimensions of psychopathy. A sample of adolescents with and without conduct disorder was used to answer the question whether there is a relationship between intelligence and the three domains of psychopathy and whether conduct disorder moderates these three relationships (N = 89, Mage = 17.1, SDage = 1.33). The participants were asked to fill in the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory, the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia to decide if the participants were meeting the criteria for the classification of conduct disorder or not, and to complete some tasks of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (third edition) or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (third edition) to estimate the general intelligence. To answer the research question six regression analyses were performed. Socioeconomic status was considered as a control variable within every regression analysis. After performing the regression analyses only one result was found to be significant: the moderation effect of intelligence X conduct disorder on the relationship between intelligence and the affective dimension of psychopathy. There appeared to be a crossover interaction in which the relationship between intelligence and the affective dimension of psychopathy is positive when someone has the classification of conduct disorder and in which the relationship between intelligence and the affective dimension of psychopathy is negative when someone doesn’t have conduct disorder.","['Intelligence', 'antisociale gedragsstoornis', 'psychopathie']"
Risk factors and prevalence of suicidal ideations for women with psychiatric disorders in the perinatal period,"Draijer, Sterre",['Niki Antypa'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objectives: Suicidal behavior amongst new mothers seems to be a big problem, with suicide being the cause of 20% of postpartum deaths (Lindahl et al., 2005). Even more common are suicidal ideations, which are experienced by 24.5% of pregnant women in a clinical setting (Taylor et al., 2016). This study aims to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for perinatal suicidality amongst a Dutch clinical setting. Methods: In this retrospective cohort design, data of N = 103 women was collected on psychiatric diagnosis, psychopharmacological medication use, psychiatric and somatic comorbidity, physical health, pregnancy related information, information on intoxications and socioeconomic information. Suicidal ideation and behavior were questioned by the treating physician during the intake interview and follow-up and measured by means of two questionnaires, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Results: Data on suicidal ideation was available for 62 women, of which 52 experienced suicidal ideations (83.87%). Univariate logistic regression analysis found total EPDS score at intake (OR 1.17 = 95% CI: 1.03-1.39) and total BSI score at intake (OR = 5.34, 95% CI: 1.40-20.83) to be significant predictors for suicidal ideation. Limitations: The power of the study can be seen as a limitation. Also, there was limited information available on suicidal ideation during follow-up and suicidal behavior in general. Conclusions: This study found an increased prevalence of suicidal ideation in women during the perinatal period. In order to prevent maternal suicidal behavior, it is important to do more extensive research with a large sample size, focusing on social factors, life events, self-harm behaviors and maternal psychopathology. This will lead to a better understanding of all the risk factors involved in maternal suicidal ideations and reduce maternal suicidality.",
Het classificeren van de ziekte van Alzheimer met behulp van subcorticale volumes,"Gelder, Catharina van","['Vos, F., de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Verschillende subcorticale volumes nemen af in volume bij Alzheimerpatiënten. Het is niet duidelijk of het gebruik van alleen de volumes van de hippocampus en de thalamus voldoende zijn om een juiste diagnose te stellen of dat het toevoegen van de overige subcorticale volumes leidt tot een hogere accuratesse. Daarom wordt in dit onderzoek de ziekte van Alzheimer geclassificeerd met behulp van een model met alleen de volumes van de hippocampus en thalamus, een model waar de volumes van de putamen en de amygdala worden toegevoegd en een model waaraan de overige subcorticale volumes (caudate nucleus, pallidum en accumbens) worden toegevoegd. Voor het testen van de hypotheses is gebruik gemaakt van MRI-scans van 173 gezonde ouderen en 76 Alzheimerpatiënten. Met behulp van logistische regressie met LASSO-penalty en kruisvalidatie zijn drie modellen getest. Het model met de hippocampus, thalamus, putamen en amygdala blijkt de hoogste accuratesse (0,807), specificiteit (0,919) en sensitiviteit (0,553) te hebben. Het model met alleen de hippocampus en thalamus heeft echter de hoogste AUC (0,838). De verschillen tussen de drie modellen zijn klein. Geconcludeerd kan worden dat een model met alleen de hippocampus en thalamus Alzheimer met dezelfde (of zelfs een hogere) accuratesse classificeert in vergelijking met uitgebreidere modellen met meerdere of alle subcorticale volumes. Dit komt waarschijnlijk doordat de hippocampus essentieel is voor de classificatie en de overige subcorticale volumes hier weinig aan kunnen toevoegen.","['ziekte van Alzheimer', 'sMRI', 'subcorticale volumes', 'hippocampus']"

Adviseur of assistent? De rol van PA’s in de Nederlandse politiek (2003-2022),"Dijkstra, Haije","['Otjes, S.P.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"PA’s hebben een unieke positie in het Nederlandse staatsbestel: ze worden persoonlijk door hun bewindspersoon benoemd, zijn actief in de ambtelijke top van hun ministerie en hebben veel contact met politici, partijgenoten, media en belangenbehartigers. Tegelijkertijd is er weinig inzicht in hoeverre hun werk eerder ondersteunend of strategisch is en of dit de afgelopen twintig jaar veranderd is. Op basis van dertien interviews met PA’s kan gesteld worden dat de rol sterk afhankelijk is van de positie van de bewindspersoon in het kabinet en de taken die een PA van de bewindspersoon mag uitvoeren. Binnen kabinetten zitten hierdoor grote verschillen in de mate waarin PA’s strategisch opereren. Er zijn ook overeenkomsten: vrijwel alle PA’s besteden de meeste tijd op het ministerie, gevolgd door het parlement, het contact met de minister en contact met journalisten en belangenbehartigers. Het werk van de PA lijkt de afgelopen twee decennia, door toegenomen versplintering en minderheden voor kabinetten in de Eerste en Tweede Kamer, strategischer geworden. Ook zijn PA’s meer tijd aan het parlement gaan besteden. De instelling van een parlementair contactpersoon zorgt er daarnaast voor dat een gedeelte van de ondersteunende werkzaamheden uit handen wordt genomen. De maatschappelijke discussie over dualisme raakt direct aan het werk van de PA, die als verbinder en vertaler voor menselijk contact tussen twee werelden kan zorgen. Door de beperkte functieomschrijving kan het takenpakket erg verschillen: van het halen van koffie tot aan meedenken bij vacatures voor topambtenaren aan toe. Inzichten uit dit onderzoek zijn relevant voor de discussie over kabinetisering in Nederland, maar kunnen ook gebruikt worden in het aangekondigde onderzoek naar regelgeving voor PA’s door het ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties.","['PA’s', 'politiek adviseurs', 'politiek-bestuurlijke verhoudingen', 'dualisme', 'kabinetisering', 'coalities', 'minderheidskabinetten', 'politiek personeel', 'politieke benoemingen']"
A Mediating Role of Rumination in the Association Between Parental Trait Anxiety and Verbal Threat Transmission of Covid-19 in the Family,"Zejmo, Olga O","['Nimphy, C.A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background In Rachman’s three-pathway theory of fear acquisition, negative information transmission as provided by parents plays a crucial role in the intrafamilial transfer of fear in children. To date, little research has been devoted to specific mechanisms underpinning this process within the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Objective The aim of the present study was to explore the mediating role of rumination emotion regulation strategy in the link between parental trait anxiety and the frequency with which parents communicate threatening information about Covid-19 to their children. Methods The sample consisted of 332 parents(75.9% mothers and 24.1% fathers) living in the Netherlands who completed online questionnaires measuring their trait anxiety (the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders Adult version; SCARED-A), cognitive emotion regulation (the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire; CERQ), and their perspective on the transmission of negative information regarding Covid-19 (adapted version of the Fears of Swine Flu Questionnaire; FSFQ). Results Against expectations, rumination did not mediate the link between parental trait anxiety and verbal fear transmission. It was found that parental trait anxiety was positively associated with rumination. Verbal fear transmission was not related to parental trait anxiety nor rumination. Discussion The findings underscore the importance of mental well-being of parents in the pandemic situation, which should be addressed in family interventions. Furthermore, the obtained results suggest that there might be other indirect pathways involved in the parental fear transmission mechanism.","['parental trait anxiety', 'rumination', 'parental threat information transmission', 'Covid-19']"

De verwachting van dit onderzoek is dat de partij tot de rechts-populistische partijfamilie behoort, of tot de agraristische partijfamilie. Aan de hand van bestaande literatuur zijn er per partijfamilie drie indicatoren ontwikkeld die de ideologische kernkenmerken van de partijfamilie meten. Bij radicaal rechts-populisme zijn dit nativisme, autoritarisme en populisme (Mudde, 2007). Bij agrarisme zijn dit het contrast tussen stad en platteland, decentralisatie en de relatie tussen mens en natuur. Aan de hand van de genoemde aspecten, en in vergelijking met een bestaande rechts-populistische partij (PVV), is de BBB gescoord op zowel radicaal rechts-populisme als agrarisme. Ik maak hiervoor gebruik van content analysis. Het materiaal dat gebruikt is, zijn parlementaire instrumenten, speeches en het verkiezingsprogramma. De onderzochte instrumenten splitsen zich toe op de periode van maart 2021 tot september 2022. Dit onderzoek wijst uit dat BBB op één aspect van recht- populisme een hogere score haalt dan de PVV, zijnde populisme. Bij agrarisme behaalt de BBB op alle drie de aspecten een hogere score dan de rechts-populistische PVV en de hoogste scores bij het aspect contrast stad-platteland. Er wordt daarom geconcludeerd dat de BBB tot de agraristische partijfamilie behoort, ondanks het wel (agrarisch) populistische karakteristieken bevat.","['BBB', 'Partijfamilies', 'Agrarisme', 'Rechts-populisme']"

Does a higher level of education for women decrease the performance of FGM in developing countries? The research is about FGM in Burkina Faso which eventually allows us to say more about the influence of educational levels on the performance of FGM in general. In Burkina Faso, we have seen a decrease in the prevalence of FGM over the last 10 years. Even though FGM has been banned since 1996 the practice is still very common. Even now more than 70% of girls and women underwent this operation (Equality Now, 2021). We will do a statistical analysis to show the relationship between education and the prevalence of FGM. We also highlight the social norms and convention theory that lay behind this causation. The findings indicate that a higher level of education increases the chance that a woman is uncircumcised, controlling for Type of Place of Residence, Religion, Worked in the Last 12 Months, Ever Heard of Female Cutting, Wealth, and Husbands/Partner’s Education. We also found that the odds of being uncircumcised rise when women have educated partners. When educated men become more willing to marry an uncircumcised woman it suggests a break, caused by education, from the social norms and beliefs that form the traditional practice of FGM within Burkina Faso.","['FGM', 'Female Genital Mutilation', 'Burkina Faso', 'Health', 'Africa', 'Education', 'Social Norms', 'Convention Theory']"

In dit onderzoek is het volume van de hippocampus en de FC van de hippocampus met de rest van het brein vergeleken aan de hand van de sMRI en de RS- fMRI. Er is onderzocht welke van deze twee scans de hoogste accuratesse levert bij het diagnosticeren van Alzheimer. Omdat RS-fMRI veelbelovend is bij een vroegtijdige classificatie is de verwachting van het onderzoek dat de RS-fMRI een betere voorspeller is van AD. Om dit te onderzoeken is er gebruik gemaakt van een logistische regressieanalyse met LASSO penalty in combinatie met kruisvalidatie. De gebruikte dataset in dit onderzoek betreft informatie van in totaal 249 participanten, waaronder 76 Alzheimerpatiënten en een controlegroep van 173 gezonde ouderen. Er zijn drie modellen geanalyseerd: volume van de linker en rechter hippocampus (1), het model van de functionele connectiviteit van de linker en rechter hippocampus met de rest van het brein (2) en het model dat deze beide type predictoren combineert (3). Deze modellen hebben respectievelijk een accuratesse van 0.80, 0.46 en 0,79. Uit de resultaten van het onderzoek blijkt dat het volume van de hippocampus de hoogste accuratesse oplevert, wat in tegenspraak is met de hypothese die stelt dat de RS- fMRI de hoogste accuratesse zou opleveren. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat het volume van de hippocampus beter kan worden gebruikt voor AD classificatie dan RS-fMRI.","['Alzheimer classification, MRI, fMRI, Hippocampus']"

Verder laat onderzoek zien dat slaapduur een rol kan spelen in zowel stress als exploratiegedrag. Er is nog niet eerder gekeken naar de invloed van stress en slaapduur op exploratiegedrag, gemeten door roaming entropy, in een virtuele omgeving bij mensen.

Daarna dienden de participanten in te vullen wat hun gewoonlijke slaapduur was. De resultaten van de huidige studie lieten geen effect van stress en slaapduur op exploratiegedrag zien. Dit kan mogelijk verklaard worden doordat de stressmanipulatie afwijkt van de stressmanipulatie in dierenstudies, er geen nieuwigheid werd getest, individuele verschillen (e.g. persoonlijke factoren) een rol kunnen spelen, slaapduur niet werd gemanipuleerd en geen andere slaapfactoren werden geïncludeerd (e.g. slaapefficiëntie en slaapkwaliteit).

The Volunteers Dilemma: The influence of changing costs and social value orientation,"Engel, Frederik Job",['Dr. E.W. de Kwaadsteniet'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,The volunteers dilemma is an often occurring social situation in which an individual has to choose whether to sacrifice some self-interest to benefit the group. In this study we investigate changing costs and social value orientation (SVO). Rising volunteering costs and decreasing group benefits are conditions in which the subjective value decreases fast over time in comparison to the starting position. The comparison between the starting point and the deteriorated position could be a reason to volunteer while it stops the position from worsening or even prevent it from happening. In an incentivized online experiment it was tested whether increasing volunteering costs and decreasing group benefits leads to more and faster volunteering. Furthermore the role of SVO with regard to volunteering frequency was investigated. Results indicated a faster but less frequent volunteering pattern as a result of the changing costs and furthermore showed a positive relation between SVO score and volunteering frequency. The possible explanations are discussed as well as future research and limitations.,"['Volunteer', 'costs', 'increasing', 'SVO']"
Social learning about the self depends on environmental cues and top-down expectations: A neurocomputational study of adolescents and young adults,"Zanasca, Tommaso","['Van der Molen, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Low self-esteem is a risk factor for several mental health issues, and it can be formed because of negative social feedback. Adolescents are particularly at risk, since they may be more influenced by such feedback than adults and have been shown to adjust their self-feelings more in reaction to negative compared to positive feedback. However, both the age bias and the negative learning bias have not been fully supported by previous research as evidence is contradictory. This study aimed to fill this gap by measuring the degree of change in feelings about the self in response to social performance feedback. In this research, a sample of 75 adolescents (12 to 17 years old) and 145 young adults (18 to 25 years old) underwent a task in which they spoke in front of judges. They then had to evaluate statements regarding their performance and subsequently saw the evaluations of judges on the same statements. A reinforcement learning model was adapted to create affective learning rates (ALRs), which were compared between adolescents and adults and between positive and negative feedback. Additionally, EEG data was gathered and frontal-midline theta (FMT) activity following feedback was compared between groups. This allowed us to assess to what extent such feedback is processed and integrated as a cue for future behavioral performance. This study found no differences in ALR between age groups, but a significantly higher ALR in response to positive feedback for both age groups. This is inconsistent with previous results, and we suggest that might depend on task structure. No significant difference was found in FMT, and we suggest that may be because FMT is more related to expectancy of feedback rather than to its valence. Together, this study indicates that adjustments in self-esteem following social performance feedback may depend more on environmental demands than developmental differences, and that the way such feedback is processed may rely on top-down expectations.","['Adolescents', 'EEG', 'Reinforcement learning', 'Self-concept', 'Social performance feedback']"

The Effectiveness of Culturally Adapted vs. Non-Adapted Psychological Treatments for Refugees: A Meta-Analysis,"Slijk, Rosalie","['Molendijk, M.L.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Refugees form a population with a high prevalence of psychological disorders relative to non-refugee populations (WHO, 2021). It has been suggested that cultural adaptation of psychological treatments can help to optimise the effectiveness of treatments for refugees, but there is a lack of clear research on this topic. The current work addresses this by investigating the following research question: Are culturally adapted psychological treatments more effective than non-adapted treatments in reducing symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety in refugees? It is hypothesized that culturally adapted treatments are more effective than non-adapted treatments. The research question is explored by performing a meta-analysis of treatment effects from a selection of studies. Results from the meta-analysis show significant treatment effects of culturally adapted treatments and non-adapted treatments for PTSD, depression and anxiety. However, no significant differences in treatment effects were found between culturally adapted treatments and non-adapted treatments. Therefore, the conclusion is that culturally adapted treatments for PTSD, depression and anxiety are not more effective for refugees than non-adapted treatments. The main implication of this is that it might not be necessary for clinicians and researchers to invest in cultural adaptation of psychological treatments.","['psychotherapy', 'psychological treatment', 'refugees', 'meta-analysis', 'PTSD', 'depression', 'anxiety']"
Classificatie van de ziekte van Alzheimer aan de hand van corticale en subcorticale MRI-biomarkers: Welke breinregio’s zijn het meest geschikt voor het classificeren van de ziekte van Alzheimer.,"Bouter, Jordy","['de Vos, F']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek wordt er aan de hand van corticale en subcorticale biomarkers een classificatie-analyse van de ziekte van Alzheimer uitgevoerd door middel van het analyseren van structurele MRI-scans. Vervolgens wordt er een vergelijking uitgevoerd van de twee soorten biomarkers om te onderzoeken welke van de twee een hogere classificatie accuratesse oplevert. Deze biomarkers zijn de dikte van de hersenschors en het volume van de subcorticale gebieden in de hersenen. Vermoedelijk zal het meten van de subcorticale volumes een hogere accuratesse opleveren aangezien de hippocampus, een subcorticaal gebied, over het algemeen als eerste en het meest atrofieert. De steekproefgrootte is 249 waarvan 173 gezonde ouderen zijn en 76 proefpersonen gediagnosticeerd zijn met een vorm van de ziekte van Alzheimer. Zowel de corticale dikte als de subcorticale volumes zijn gemeten aan de hand van structurele MRI-scans. De classificatieanalyse zal gedaan worden met een logistische regressieanalyse met LASSO penalty. Er is een dubbele kruisvalidatie uitgevoerd waarin de buitenste kruisvalidatie is gebruikt om de modellen te trainen en te evalueren op twee onafhankelijke datasets en de binnenste kruisvalidatie is gebruikt om de grootte van de LASSO penalty te optimaliseren. De resultaten van het onderzoek zijn niet zoals verwacht. De AUC-waardes van de twee metingen zijn zeer gelijkwaardig. (Corticale dikte =0.903, subcorticale volumes =0.883). De literatuur spreekt dit resultaat echter tegen waarbij de accuratesse van de classificatie aan de hand van de subcorticale volumes een hogere accuratesse zou moeten opleveren. Ook is de gemiddelde MMSE-score van de groep met de ziekte van Alzheimer 20,4 wat een cognitieve aandoening kan aanduiden. Deze resultaten zouden verklaard kunnen worden doordat de proefpersonen met een vorm van de ziekte van Alzheimer in een wat gevorderder stadium van de ziekte zitten. Door wijdverbreide atrofie is het daarom ook mogelijk geworden om aan de hand van corticale atrofie een hoge accuratesse van Alzheimerclassificatie te behalen.","['Alzheimer, classificatie, cortex, subcorticaal, hippocampus']"

The Causal Beliefs of Adolescents and Parents about the Adolescent’s Depression: Is there a relationship between the extent to which parents and adolescents agree on these causal beliefs and the parental bond?,"Verhagen, Madelief","['Elzinga, B.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Different studies have investigated the adolescents’ causal beliefs about their major depressive disorder. However, the beliefs of the parents about the causes of their adolescent’s depression and the extent to which the parents agree with their adolescent on these causes has not been studied yet. In addition, the relation between this agreement and the parental bond has also not been studied yet. The aim of the current study was thus to investigate the possible relationship between the extent to which the parents of adolescents with depression and their adolescent share the same ideas on the causes of the adolescent’s depression and the parental bond. This was tested with a multivariate analysis of variance using data of the qualitative interview and the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) from the RE-PAIR study. The agreement score was dichotomized into a low agreement group, reflecting the group of parents that agreed with 49% or below of the causes their adolescent mentioned, and a high agreement group, reflecting the group of parents that agreed with 50% or above of the causes their adolescent mentioned. The main finding of this study was that the two most frequently mentioned causes, ‘problematic social contacts’ and ‘heredity/genes’, overlapped between adolescents, mothers and fathers. Other causes that were frequently mentioned by adolescents did differ from the causes most frequently mentioned by their parents. For example, both mothers and fathers frequently mentioned causes that were related to the category ‘characteristics of the child’, while adolescents did not mention this frequently. The second main finding of this study was that there was not a significant difference between the low and high agreement group on the parental bond scores for both mothers and fathers. A limitation was that the current sample was not normally distributed on the categories of gender. Further research should examine a different population.","['Adolescent depression', 'causal beliefs', 'parental bond']"

"Comparing All Possible Combinations of Structural, Diffusion, and Resting State Functional MRI to Classify Alzheimer’s Disease","Twuijver, Vincent van","['Vos, F. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Introduction: Structural MRI has been widely used for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis, but resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) and diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) can also be used for AD classification. Various studies compared several combinations of MRI types to assess whether combinations would increase classification accuracy, yet no study that researched these 3 MRI types compared all possible combinations for AD classification within one dataset. Methods: This thesis compares 7 models of MRI combinations from 1 dataset to classify AD patients (N = 76) and controls (N = 173). From the sMRI scans, 14 subcortical volumes, 68 regional cortical thickness values, and 48 regional grey matter density values were calculated, the RS-fMRI scans were used to calculate pairwise functional connectivity (FC) between 70 brain regions, and from the DTI scans fractional anisotropy (FA) values were calculated for 20 white matter regions. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) was used to set a penalty, with the goal to reduce overfitting by reducing the number of variables. With cross-validation, the models were trained and tested to estimate the classification accuracy of AD. Results: sMRI had an AUC of .931, sMRI + DTI resulted in an AUC of .929. The sMRI + RS-fMRI + DTI model had an AUC of .902. Conclusion: sMRI is the best single MRI type for classifying AD, and is better than any combination of MRI types. RS-fMRI and DTI were not helpful for increasing classification accuracy.","[""Alzheimer's Disease"", 'Classification', 'Structural MRI', 'Resting state fMRI', 'Diffusion tensor imaging']"

The dog’s ‘fake pupil’: The influence of humans on a dog’s appearance,"Tjioe, Michelle",['Prof. dr. M.E. Kret'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The human-canine bond exists for over 15,00 years ago, when humans began to socialize the European wolf-dogs. The influence of humans on the appearance of dogs created the extraordinary variety of phenotypic diversity among the modern dog. Humans seem to be particularly interested in certain paedomorphic features in animals, such as a round face and large pupils, which is related to the Kindchenschema. Remarkably, one of the characteristics in dogs is an extra dark colouring around the pupil which seems to create an enlarging effect of the existing pupil. This so-called ring might be part of the human influence within the domestication of the modern dog. As well as a higher contrast between the iris and the ring, which creates a more visible ring and therefore strengthens the influence of the ring. The current study hypothesized and expected that 1) the ring is a predictor of the level of perceived cuteness in humans, 2) contrast is a moderator of this relationship and 3) attitude is correlated with the level of perceived cuteness. The 1100 participants were asked to rate 36 pictures of dogs on cuteness via an online questionnaire. The results showed that the larger the ring, the higher the level of perceived cuteness, as well as a positive correlation between attitude and the level of perceived cuteness. However, the contrast between the ring and the iris did not influence the relationship between the ratio ring/iris and the level of perceived cuteness. These results carefully confirm the influence of humans on a dog’s appearance. Future research could focus on gazing as a predictor of perceived cuteness, including isolating the eyes as presented stimuli.","['human-canine bond', 'Kindchenschema', 'pupils', 'perceived cuteness']"
Kinderen met een geslachtschromosoomtrisomie: impact timing van diagnose op type en mate van probleemgedrag? Het verschil in type en mate van probleemgedrag tussen kinderen met een prenatale en postnatale diagnose van geslachtschromosoomtrisomie,"Hoog, Amber de","['Rijn, S. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Children with sex chromosome trisomy’s (SCT) are more vulnerable to developing behavioral, neurocognitive and social-emotional functioning problems and have an increased risk of psychopathology. This study investigates through group comparisons to what extent the timing of diagnosis (prenatal/postnatal) influences the type and degree of problem behavior of children aged 1-7 years. In total, 93 children (71 prenatal and 22 postnatal) with an extra X or Y chromosome and 102 non-clinical controls and their parents participated in the study. Types of problem behavior were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and a medical history questionnaire. The results indicate that children with SCT generally show more total and internalizing problem behavior than typically developing children, but not significantly more externalizing problem behavior. When it comes to specific problem behaviors, SCT children generally have a shorter attention span, are more easily distracted, tend to be more withdrawn and isolated, worry and experience anxieties and are more sensitive to stimuli and moodiness. The results show that no differences are found in total, internalizing and externalizing problem behavior between children with a prenatal and postnatal diagnosis. However, children with a postnatal diagnosis generally worry more excessively, experience anxiety and are often more irritable compared to children with a prenatal diagnosis of SCT. Finally, the results show that temper tantrums/oppositional behavior, short span of attention/distractibility and excessive worry and fear within the clinical group increases with age. In conclusion, this suggests that it is important to bring the possible consequences of SCT to the attention of medical care providers and parents, so that these children do not worry excessively, experience anxiety and are more irritable (anymore). This proves that there is a need for early interventions in children with SCT, to ensure the quality of life and to reduce the risk of mental health problems.","['geslachtschromosoomtrisomie', 'SCT', 'probleemgedrag', 'timing van diagnose', 'prenataal', 'postnataal']"
Social support: bandage for invisible wounds? A prospective study on gender differences in the predictive value of perceived lack of social support on post traumatic stress disorder symptom trajectories one year after injury,"Huissen, Hanna",['M. van Zuiden and J. Mouthaan'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction. The course of PTSD is heterogenous and four common symptom trajectories have been established: resilience, recovery, chronic and delayed-onset. Social support is a predictor of PTSD following traumatic events, however little is known about the predictive value of perceived lack social support on PTSD symptom trajectory membership. There are significant differences between men and women in the emergence of PTSD symptoms, but the potential effect of gender in the predictive value of social support on PTSD trajectories has never been investigated. Aims. We aimed to examine (1) to what extent perceived lack of social support measured shortly after acute traumatic injury predicts PTSD symptom trajectory classification, and (2) to investigate whether gender moderates this association. Method. The sample consisted of N = 377 individuals with suspected serious injury subsequent to a potential traumatic event. Perceived lack of social support (SSL-d) was measured at baseline and PTSD symptoms (CAPS-IV clinical interview) were assessed at baseline, 1, 3 6 and 12 months post-trauma. Participants were previously classified into trajectories based on their initial PTSD symptom severity and change in symptoms over time by utilizing Bayesian latent growth mixture modeling. The predictive value of perceived lack of social support was tested by logistic regression analyses on three sets of contrasting trajectories with gender as a moderator: resilience vs. recovery, resilience vs. chronic, and recovery vs. chronic. Results. – Perceived lack of social support significantly predicted trajectory classification in the following sets of contrasting trajectories: chronicity vs. resilience and recovery vs. resilience, but after adjustment for multiple testing the effect was no longer significant. No significant effect of social support was found for the analysis predicting recovery vs. chronicity. Further, gender did not moderate the relation between social support and PTSD trajectories. Discussion. There may be a non-significant trend predicting membership of trajectories with initial PTSD symptoms (recovery and chronic) instead of a non-symptomatic trajectory (resilience) for individuals with a high-level perceived lack of support. A high perceived lack of support did not predict the maintenance of symptoms in individuals with elevated PTSD symptom levels. The predictive value of social support on PTSD symptom trajectories may be stronger for negative interactions and in high-betrayal trauma populations.","['Post traumatic stress disorder, social support, gender, trajectory, traumatic event']"
Een simpeler MRI-model voor Alzheimer classificatie: Onderzoek naar een classificatiemodel met een kleiner aantal voorspellers,"Kravchenko, Nina","['de Vos, F.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze bachelor scriptie onderzocht of het mogelijk was om een model met een kleiner aantal voorspellers te maken voor het classificeren van Alzheimer aan de hand van atrofiematen berekend met behulp van MRI-scans. Er is gebruikgemaakt van voorspellers uit drie datasets en er werd gekeken naar welke voorspellers daarvan in het model zouden komen. De gestelde hypothesen waren als volgt: 1) het is mogelijk om een simpeler model te maken met dezelfde of zelfs hogere accuratesse en 2) de hippocampus is een van de voorspellers in beide modellen. Er werd gewerkt met een LASSO logistische regressie met een strengere en een minder strenge penalty. Door de penalty’s werden minder relevante voorspellers buiten het model gehouden. Uit de resultaten bleek dat het model met 21 voorspellers een accuratesse had van AUC=0.92. Het simpelere model met slechts 8 voorspellers had een accuratesse van AUC=0.91. Hiermee kon de eerste hypothese niet bevestigd worden. De tweede hypothese werd wel bevestigd, aangezien bij beide modellen de hippocampus deel uitmaakte van de voorspellers. Ondanks dat het simpelere model minder accuraat bleek te zijn dan het complexere model, was het verschil tussen beide accuratessewaardes erg klein. Daarbij telde het simpelere model slechts 8 voorspellers in tegenstelling tot 21. Dit simpelere model zou voordelig kunnen zijn voor verder onderzoek naar classificatie van Alzheimer, omdat er hiermee minder atrofiematen berekend hoeven worden. Dit is gunstig omdat de diagnose van Alzheimer sneller kan worden gesteld, de benodigde hulp sneller kan worden verleend en overbodige kosten zo worden vermeden.","['Alzheimer', 'classificatiemodel', 'MRI-model', 'classificatie']"

Prediction Model for Irritable Bowel Syndrome Using Routine Primary Care Data,"Graaf, Maud van de","['Kitselaar, W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Despite being a common disease with a complexity of symptoms, irritable bowel syndrome is often under-recognized and under-treated by GPs. Improving the early identification of symptoms is in order to be provide an early, adequate IBS diagnosis and maybe even treatment. The aim was to create a model to predict IBS-diagnosis two years before onset with the use of routine primary healthcare data. Methods: A cohort study was caried out based on the available routine primary healthcare data from GPs in Leiden and the Hague. From this data patients have been extracted with first onset IBS between January 2017 to December 2018, the IBS-cohort. Patients were also randomly selected (1:10) without the IBS-diagnosis, the non-IBS cohort. The data included demographic, enrolment information, clinical coding of symptoms and diagnosis according to the International Classification of Primary Cara (ICPC), and medical administrative data. Stepwise backward selection was used to select certain potential predictors out of the 104 available variables. With the use of logistic regression, these selected predictors were used to generate an effective prediction model. Model performance was assessed with the use of stepwise backward selection and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Findings: Data from approximately 300,000 patients were available. The study population included 3586 patients, in which the IBS diagnosis was recorded in 326 patients (9.1%). The baseline model, the full model with all available non-selected predictors and the selected prediction model all showed a good performance, of 0.63, 0.73 and 0.71. Conclusions: To improve the under-recognition and under-treatment of IBS this study has demonstrated the potential of prediction models in identifying IBS-diagnosis in patients. Further research is needed to externally validate the generalizability of this study. Also, improvement can be found in implementing the social, psychological and emotional symptoms in the model.","['Prediction model', 'Irritable bowel syndrome', 'routine care data', 'Leiden', 'primary care']"

The data from 150 participants were analyzed and results showed main effects of intervention of bystanders, the need to belong, the need for meaningful existence, and self-blame. Here, passive bystanders affected these needs more negatively than active bystanders. Additional analyses also showed main effects for the need to belong, bystander blame, and positive emotions. However, no main effects were found of the need for control and self-esteem, perpetrator blame, and negative emotions.

Peer Victimization and Learning about The Self: How Frontal Theta Oscillations and Peer Victimization are associated with adjusting Self-View in response to Social Feedback,"Franco, Gloria",['Melle J.W. van der Molen'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Peer victimization is defined as physically, verbally, or psychologically abusing the victim with the purpose of causing them harm. Research suggests that peer victimization is linked to a variety of different cognitive outcomes, such as fear of negative evaluation, rumination, low self-esteem, and self-blaming. However, not much research has been done on whether peer victimization impacts how people learn from feedback. The goal of this study was to reveal whether participants’ level of peer victimization influenced their affective updating (i.g. changes in feelings of the self over time) in response to negative versus positive feedback. For this, a social evaluative paradigm using an impromptu speech task was employed on 97 participants with a mean age of 20.27 years. Participants had to evaluate themselves, receive feedback from judges, and then rate how they felt about themselves. Results indicated that the level of peer victimization did not predict positivity or negativity biases in adapting self-views in response to feedback mismatch. With the aim of unraveling the neurophysiological correlates of learning from feedback, the role of midfrontal theta power was investigated, since theta activity has been found to be stronger during social rejection, and it has been linked to learning and prediction errors. More specifically, theta activity was expected to strengthen the relationship between peer victimization and negative learning rates. Results revealed that theta activity did not moderate this relationship. This thesis offers a first attempt to unravel the connection between social feedback, peer victimization, and high-frequency parietal delta power.","['electroencephalography, frontal theta oscillation, learning, peer victimization, self-evaluation, social feedback']"

Research identified that individual differences in the ability to enjoy hedonic experiences are explained by the experience of intrusive thoughts. Hypothesizing that individuals with financial stress have more reason to ruminate, it is relevant to investigate financially stressed individuals are being disadvantaged or whether a high ability to enjoy oneself can help to disregard intrusive thoughts about their financial situation. Therefore, current study investigated individual differences in the experience of enjoyable activities and how price, one’s ability to enjoy and financial scarcity can predict hedonic consumer choices. An scenario-study describing a restaurant visit (€25 vs. €60) was performed on a section of the Dutch population (n = 129). Results of the study show that individuals prefer a cheaper restaurant visit when the goal is to maximize pleasure, but prefer a more expensive restaurant when the goal is to maximize quality. Furthermore, having a good ability to enjoy oneself can predict the amount of experienced enjoyment in a expensive restaurant visit. The study did not find a relationship between subjective financial stress and experienced enjoyment. Lastly, contradicting expectations, Trait Hedonic Capacity predicts enjoyment for people without financial stress, but not for individuals with financial stress. Results of current research should be interpreted with care since the used sample did not contain enough participants with financial stress.","['Trait Hedonic Capacity', 'Subjective Financial Stress', 'Hedonic Activity', 'Hedonism', 'Price', 'Enjoyment', 'Subjective Well-Being']"
Evaluation of the Implicit Memory Method for Criminal Investigation (IMMCI) The Effect of Focused Attention and Induced Remembering on Source Memory and Recognition Memory within the IMMCI,"Bie, Elin de",['Fenna Poletiek'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The Implicit Memory Method for Criminal Investigation (IMMCI) is a method that exploits the implicit knowledge guilty suspects have about a crime scene. When this method can be implemented in practice, it may support crime investigation. The method is mainly based on using source confusion to elicit implicit memory about the crime scene. At the police station, suspects are shown pictures of manipulated objects from the crime scene (a green chair replaces a red chair, e.g.). Sometime later, suspects carry out a recognition memory test with pictures featuring both actual objects from the crime scene and manipulated ones. Individuals having seen the original objects are expected to be confused about when and where the original and the manipulated ones were presented, revealing their memory for the crime scene. The aim of this study is to evaluate the validity of the IMMCI method in a lab experiment simulating guilty and innocent suspects: individuals who did and individuals who did not see the crime scene. Moreover, we test the influence of attention and remember instruction, in this process. The main hypothesis is that the ‘guilty’ participants have lower scores on source memory than the ‘innocent’ participants. Additionally, attention is expected to improve source memory accuracy. The results show that source memory for innocent participants improves with attention, while the opposite effect is visible for guilty participants. Overall, the IMMCI is able to discriminate between guilty and innocent suspects based on their source memory on score to a certain extent. With some improvements, the IMMCI could contribute to cybercrime investigation. Further research on improving the ecological validity of the method is needed.","['Cybercrime, source memory, recognition memory, IMMCI, focused attention, reminding']"

The current research investigated what type of help participants prefer to offer to a person in debt, focusing on two types of help: budget coaching, where debtors are being coached to keep their autonomy, and is often offered to people in early debt stages. We defined this as autonomy-oriented help. With budget management, the finances are taken off hands to relieve the debtor from stress, which is often offered to people in late debt stages. We defined this as dependency-oriented help. Previous research showed that people need dependency-oriented help when their financial stress causes cognitive impairments, we think this is also needed in an intermediate debt stage, than only in a late debt stage. We investigated if participants empathized with the help- seeker, would acknowledge the amount of stress, and would offer dependency-oriented help in an intermediate stage. Therefore, we manipulated the three debt stages; early, intermediate, and late, and manipulated perspective-taking. In this experiment, participants (N = 374) were randomly assigned to the manipulation conditions, read a scenario about a debtor in need, and filled out a questionnaire. We found that participants indicated acknowledging the stress of the help-seeker, but by taking perspective, participants indicated offering more autonomy- oriented help than dependency-oriented help. With this research, we suggest the debt counseling of the Netherlands to provide debt counselors the knowledge about debts, stress, and cognitive functioning.","['debt', 'stress', 'cognitive functioning', 'perspective-taking', 'autonomy-oriented help', 'dependency-oriented help']"

British participants completed a survey consisting of the Picture Story Exercise, a help acceptance questionnaire and the Brief-Cope. The study showed that neither need for autonomy, nor problem-focused coping is predictive for help acceptance. Furthermore, problem-focused coping did not moderate the association between need for autonomy and help acceptance. Exploratory analyses indicated that emotion-focused or avoidant coping did not moderate this association.

The impact of educational level and food literacy on the effectiveness of defaults in stimulating healthy food choices,"VAN HINSBERG, Vera MISS",['L. C. Van Gestel'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Increasing attention is being paid to health inequalities in the Netherlands. Policymakers and government agencies are looking for methods to reduce the health gap, especially in order to increase the health of people in risk groups. People with a lower level of education and low food literacy appear to be an important risk group for food-related health issues. Nudging has been shown to be an easy and effective way to promote healthy behavior. For this reason, this study investigated whether the level of education and food literacy influence the effectiveness of default nudges in encouraging healthy food choices. An online supermarket experiment was used with a default and control condition. In the default condition, a healthy food product was displayed larger and preselected to investigate whether this option was chosen more often. A total number of 229 participants took part in the online supermarket experiment and completed the Self-Perceived food Literacy scale beforehand. Default nudges were found to have a positive effect on stimulating the proportion of nudged healthy products, but no interaction effect was found for different levels of education and food literacy. In conclusion, nudges can be used effectively, but no difference in effectiveness was found for different levels of education and food literacy. However, one nudge is not going to make the difference in reducing health inequalities. Yet, nudges do have promising effects and can contribute to stimulating healthy food choices one step at a time.","['Health gap', 'nudging', 'defaults', 'education', 'food literacy']"
The Cost of Hedonism,"Dirven, Gijs",['Dr. M.L.W. Vliek'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present research aims to examine the effect that different levels of perceived financial stress (PIFS) and trait hedonic capacity (THC) have on one's ability to enjoy a hedonic activity. We examined (1) whether people with more perceived financial stress will prefer and enjoy hedonic activities, which are less expensive, and (2) we examined whether this effect is moderated by one's trait hedonic capacity. This moderation was thought to be present because THC explains our ability to block out intrusive thoughts (like financial stress) and successfully pursue a hedonic goal. In an exploratory analysis, we examined (3) people higher in trait hedonic capacity are less likely to have intrusive thoughts (cognitive conflict) and therefore enjoy a hedonic activity more than people low in trait hedonic capacity. The Participants (N = 129) were presented with The Trait Hedonic Capacity Scale (THC) and The Psychological Inventory of Financial Scarcity (PIFS) followed by two dinner situations, one being a cheap condition and a second being an expensive condition followed by 5 questions about their enjoyment of the activity and 2 questions about their intrusive thoughts. The results indicate no main effect of perceived financial stress on enjoyment. There was however a main effect of PIFS on the amount of intrusive thoughts, where higher PIFS resulted in more intrusive thoughts. THC was a strong predictor of enjoyment for those in the low PIFS group but not in the high PIFS group. There also was a significant main effect of THC on the amount of intrusive thoughts of a participant where higher THC resulted in people having less intrusive thoughts.","['Perceived financial stress, Hedonism, Trait Hedonic Capacity, Well-being, enjoyment']"
"Kleuterpraat met prentenboeken: Het effect van klassikaal, digitaal en interactief voorlezen via e-Prent&ABC+ op het leergedrag en de leesprestaties van kleuters met probleemgedrag","Stienstra, Anne Lotte","['Dijken, M.J. van', 'Espin, C.A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Teachers in kindergarten are confronted with many differences between emergent literacy skills children have developed before going to primary school. Since these skills are the foundation of the development of reading skills, it is important to promote emergent literacy in kindergarten. E- Prent&ABC is a method to improve emergent literacy that combines animated e-books with print referencing and the 4-cycle-model for word development during classroom book reading. A previous study has demonstrated that e-Prent&ABC enhances vocabulary and phonological awareness of kindergartners. However, kindergartners with problematic learning behavior do not benefit from these positive effects. Therefore, the current study adds behavior regulating elements to e-Prent&ABC to improve the learning behavior of kindergartners with problematic learning behavior and to help them benefit more from classroom book reading. This quasi-experimental study explores how whole-class reading with the expanded method e-Prent&ABC+ can enhance learning behavior, vocabulary, and phonological awareness of kindergartners with problematic learning behavior. 60 kindergartners (30 with and 30 without problematic learning behavior) from nine kindergarten groups participated in three conditions (control condition, e-Prent&ABC, and e-Prent&ABC+). Ultimately, the results demonstrate that both kindergartners with and without problematic learning behavior showed the most positive learning behavior during the control condition instead of during reading with e-Prent&ABC+ or e-Prent&ABC . Furthermore, the results confirm previous findings by showing that e-Prent&ABC effectively promotes both vocabulary and phonological awareness of kindergartners. The added elements in e-Prent&ABC+ did not better improve learning behavior and emergent literacy than e- Prent&ABC does. Compared to e-Prent&ABC, the vocabulary of the kindergartners was even smaller after reading with e-Prent&ABC+ . In spite of several limitations, this research has shown that animated e-books can be used in combination with the 4-cycle-model during whole-class book reading to create a rich literacy environment in which emergent literacy skills can be promoted simultaneously.","['beginnende geletterdheid', 'woordenschat', 'fonologisch bewustzijn', 'digitaal voorlezen', 'interactief voorlezen', 'e-books', 'leergedrag', 'e-Prent&ABC']"

Give and Take: Prosocial Giving and Perspective Taking in Gifted and Nongifted Young Adolescents,"Vos, Eveline",['Kiki Zanolie'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"This study examined differences in prosocial giving behavior of gifted and nongifted young adolescents towards five targets (a friend, disliked person, a stranger, and the participant’s father and mother), and the effects of perspective taking. 93 Dutch students between the ages of 9 and 12 were assessed using the Perspective Taking scale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, and the Prosocial Donation task, a donation game in which participants divided ten coins between themselves and various targets. Findings showed that gifted young adolescents showed less prosocial giving towards their mother than nongifted young adolescents. No difference in prosocial giving behavior was found between gifted and nongifted young adolescents towards the other targets (a friend, a disliked person, a stranger, and the participant’s father). Gifted young adolescents overall donated an equal number of coins as their nongifted peers, despite differentiating differently across targets. Furthermore, participants showed more prosocial giving behavior towards friends than strangers, which supports previous findings involving prosocial giving behavior and ingroup-outgroup differentiation. Contrary to expectations, perspective taking did not have an effect on the level of prosocial giving in young adolescents – neither gifted nor nongifted, and no difference in perspective taking was found between gifted and nongifted young adolescents. These findings show that gifted young adolescents are not so dissimilar from their nongifted peers. Our results challenge false stereotypes of gifted youth as possessing characteristic social and emotional problems. This study expanded on previous research by including giftedness and examining prosocial giving behavior to parents. Future research into prosocial giving behavior of early adolescents could include even more detailed assessments of interpersonal relationships between participants and their parents.","['Prosocial giving', 'perspective taking', 'giftedness', 'early adolescence']"

The role of facial expressions of embarrassment and positive affect in cooperation between children,"Ozor, Queen Miriam","['Dr. Anne Cuperus', 'Christopher Riddell']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Cooperation is an important part of living in a society and much research has been done to investigate the factors that promote cooperation between individuals. These studies report that cooperation could be influenced by factors like emotional facial expressions of happiness, and embarrassment, however, these are more for the adult population, and not enough for children. This study aimed to investigate the role of gender (boys and girls) as well as facial expressions of positive affect and embarrassment in the cooperative choices of children. To achieve these three hypotheses were drawn. Hypothesis one was cooperation would be higher among females than males. With the gender of the dyads randomized. Hypothesis two was, cooperation will be more when there are higher levels of positive affect. Hypothesis three was, cooperation will be more when there are higher levels of embarrassment. The participants were dyads of N = 80 children with ages ranging from 8 to 12 years old. They all performed an introduction task where half of them were asked to introduce themselves face-to-face and the other half with a black screen between them, thereby creating two visibility conditions: invisible and visible. Afterward, they played the modified version one-shot prisoner’s dilemma game. A chi-square test of independence was used to analyze hypothesis one. The results showed that there was no significant difference in cooperation between boys and girls, χ2 (1, N = 80) = .189, p = .664. A binomial logistic regression was used to analyze hypotheses two and three. The result showed that increased positive affect and embarrassment had no significant influence on the cooperative choices of children, with positive affect B=.05 SE=.18 OR = 1.06, p = .772 95% CI = [.74, 1.15] and embarrassment B=.05 SE=.07 OR = 1.05, p = .494, 95% CI = [0.91, 1.20] Therefore, it was concluded that although the results did not support the hypotheses, there may be several factors that could contribute to this, such as this study being done in real-life face-to-face settings versus the previous studies done with computer simulations or manipulations.

The influence of giftedness and pubertal phase on prosocial giving in young adolescents.,"Donkers, Mirthe","['Zanolie, C.K.K.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The current study focuses on the influence of giftedness and pubertal phase on prosocial giving. Specifically, it was examined whether young adolescents differentiate between different targets in prosocial giving, whether gifted young adolescents show more prosocial giving than non-gifted young adolescents and whether young adolescents in pubertal phase show more prosocial giving than young adolescents in pre-pubertal phase. The participants were 145 young adolescents (9-12 years old) who performed the Prosocial Donation Task (PDT) and filled out the Pubertal Development Scale (PDS). In the PDT participants divided ten coins between themselves and a specific target (friend, disliked peer, anonymous peer, father and mother). We measured their pubertal development with the PDS, after which we compared it to the Tanner Stages. This study found that young adolescents differentiate in prosocial giving towards the different targets, and that disliked peers and anonymous peers receive fewer coins than friends or parents. However, we did not find that gifted adolescents engage in more prosocial giving than non-gifted adolescents. The results of puberty showed that the pubertal phase itself does not affect prosocial giving, but that young adolescent girls do differentiate differently towards the targets than young adolescent girls in pre-pubertal phase do. For boys we found that young adolescent boys in pre-pubertal phase give fewer coins towards anonymous peers than young adolescent boys in pubertal phase. These findings suggest that targets influence young adolescents’ prosocial giving, which is insightful for social development in young adolescents. Young adolescents can act upon the person facing them and indicate that they show more prosocial giving towards their in-group than an out-group, which is in line with earlier research.","['giftedness', 'intelligence', 'regular education', 'gifted education', 'puberty', 'pubertal phase', 'prosocial giving', 'giving behaviour', 'young adolescents', 'adolescents', 'altruism', 'influence']"

The Rational Trade-Off between Cognitive Stability and Flexibility through Neural Gain Modulation,"Boomgaard, Rick van den","['Jongkees, B.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Neural gain is the mechanism underlying the stability/flexibility trade-off, which is fundamental for goal-directed yet adaptive behavior. Inspired by the development of a computational model that estimates gain, we assessed whether people rationally modulate gain to demands for stability and flexibility. We designed two task-switch digit-classification experiments with 60 participants each, in which we manipulated the proportion incongruency (PI) in experiment one and cue-to-stimulus interval (CSI) in experiment two. Our results indicated that PI manipulation did not significantly affect gain, yet incongruency costs and switch costs demonstrated an increase in stability in response to high PI. CSI manipulation significantly affected both gain and incongruency costs, demonstrating increased flexibility in response to a short preparation time. Furthermore, we used questionnaires to assess participants' ASD and ADHD trait scores and tested whether these predicted biases in gain and/or impairments in gain modulation. Despite the lack of conclusive findings, this study offers insight in the relation between ASD and ADHD and neural gain. More studies that overcome our limitations may discover the impairments in neurocognitive mechanisms underlying psychological disorders and inform treatment. Altogether, our results indicate that people rationally adapt to demands for stability and flexibility following an antagonistic trade-off. Therefore, this study contributes to the research on neuromodulation and adds to the general understanding of attention. Our findings may also help to inform applied research on the benefits and drawbacks of stability and flexibility in the workplace. Thereby, managers could be made aware of the number of tasks assigned to their employees and whether the demand to switch between them is proportional to their difficulty.","['stability/flexibility trade-off, incongruency cost, switch cost, neural gain, attractor, ADHD, ASD.']"

The first used neutral wording, whereas the second included language that aimed to reduce feelings of financial shame and financial stigma. Although results showed that the willingness to contact the organization was not significant between conditions, we found that participants visiting the modified website were more willing to recommend the organization to relatives and friends experiencing financial hardship than those on the neutral condition. Additionally, we found that participants visiting the modified website perceived the organization as more supportive and trustworthy and showed more adaptive coping mechanisms regarding their own financial situation. Lastly, results revealed that participants experiencing higher feelings of financial stigma perceived the organization as less competent.","['Financial shame, financial stigma, financial advice, organization attractiveness, competence, warmth, morality, behavioral intention, contact, recommendation, active coping.']"
Get Your Facts Straight: Prediction-Based Fact Learning Explained by Metacognitive Surprise about Facts,"Nielsen, Vibeke","['van Steenbergen, H.', 'Jolles, D.D.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Prediction-based learning is an effective teaching method for building factual knowledge, i.e., semantic learning. Its effectiveness likely depends on its potential to elicit surprise in learners. Only a few studies tested this hypothesis using a prediction-based learning framework comparable to semantic learning in the classroom. Most of these studies used physiological measures of surprise. However, the link between prediction-based semantic learning and learners' metacognitive surprise remains to be investigated. Using mixed models, we tested and explored to what degree participants' (N = 41; Mage = 21.9 years, SD = 1.5, 73% female) metacognitive surprise about the learning material (numerical trivia facts) explained how well participants learned (continuous metric) and recalled (binary metric) this material during a numerical-fact learning task designed to resemble classroomlike prediction-based learning. In line with our hypothesis, preregistered analyses showed that the more surprising participants found a fact, the more they learned from it. Extending previous work, we found that this link remained when controlling for a) between-fact differences in learning potential and b) facts already known to the participants and when c) participants failed to recall a fact correctly. Further extending previous work, our exploratory analyses suggested that learning also improved when participants perceived the facts as nonsurprising. So, the link between metacognitive surprise and learning may be u-shaped rather than linear. Altogether, these findings hint that learners'surprise about the learning material is one of the factors explaining to what degree learners learn from their prediction mistakes to update their factual knowledge. We forgo conclusions about the link between metacognitive surprise and recall accuracy since the confirmatory and exploratory results were ambiguous and negligibly small.","['metacognitive surprise', 'semantic learning', 'recall accuracy', 'prediction-based learning', 'declarative memory']"
Perception of others: How our perceptions influence psychological safety,"Loo, Tim van","['Groeneweg, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"One of the current challenges to increase patient safety is to improve the patient safety culture (Verbakel et al., 2014). An important factor in a good patient safety culture is psychological safety (Edmondson & Lei, 2014). It is important that personnel feels free to speal up about mistakes or possible improvement to enhance patient safety. However, speaking up about mistakes may harm the perception towards your competence as an individual. Therefore, the perception of others is important when speaking up about mistakes, and may harm the psychological safety someone experiences. To increase the psychological safety it is therefore important to understand the influence of the perception of others on psychological safety. In this study two goals are formulated: 1) map the perception of others in the three departments in Hospital A. 2) Investigate the relation between the perception of others and psychological safety. The second goal is investigated with use of the following hypotheses: 1) Physician Assistants have a high perceived competence score, compared to Nurses, 2) Nurses have a high warmth score and low competence score, compared to Physician Assistants, 3) Specialists gave a high competence score, as perceived by Physician Assistants and Nurses, 4) The psychological safety level is lower in Nurses, compared to Physician Assistants. To answer these hypotheses mixed-methods design is used, gathering data from online questionnaires (N = 39), which were the SCM questionnaire (Fiske et al., 2002) and the Psychological safety questionnaire (Garvin et al., 2008), observations of quality meetings (N = 13) and semi-structured interviews (N = 3). The questionnaires were first tested on a M-Turk sample of healthcare personnel, to identify the internal consistency of the questionnaires in a healthcare setting. Results showed a significant difference in perception of the competence score of Physician Assistants, with Nurses perceiving the competence level lower than the Physician Assistants. Moreover, the perceived warmth score of Nurses were found to be significantly higher within Physician Assistants, compared to Nurses. This result was not found in the perceived competence score of the Nurses. Furthermore, the perceived competence score of Specialists was found to be non-significant when comparing the perception of Nurses and Physician Assistants. At last, the psychological safety level of Nurses and Physician Assistants did not differ significantly. These results indicate that the experienced hierarchy in Hospital A is less present than originally thought. Furthermore, no correlation was found between the perception of others and psychological safety within Hospital A. However, due to the small sample size we must be cautious with drawing conclusion of the results and more research is needed to gain more insight in the current situation at Hospital A.","['Psychological safety, Perception of others, patient safety, healthcare']"
Remote and digital assessment of concept shifting: A comparison between the Trail Making Test and Concept Shifting Test,"Riswick, Anne","['Montagne, B.', 'Houdt, C.A. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the accessibility of mental healthcare was severely disrupted. One specific part of psychological diagnostics that proved to be challenging without an in- person visit, was the conductance of a neuropsychological assessment (NPA). NPAs are often performed using paper-and-pencil tasks, which leaves room for innovation in using digital tools, increasing accuracy of test scores. Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate a small part of the remote and digital assessment of cognitive functioning, in specific: concept shifting. Usually, the Trail Making Task (TMT) is used to assess concept shifting, however, previous studies pointed out problems regarding the structural non-equivalence of the two trials in the TMT, resulting in inequal motor skills needed to complete the subtests. The current study aims to investigate whether an alternative task, the Concept Shifting Task (CST), might be a superior alternative for the TMT to measure concept shifting. The CST claims to be able to control for motor speed, and this claim was tested. To do so, a Finger Tapping Task (FFT) was included in the study as a measure of motor speed. Methods: A cross-sectional study, using a within-subject design was performed: all participants were asked to complete the FTT, the TMT and the CST. Thirty-two healthy adult participants completed these three tasks using software that allowed for digital and remote assessment. Linear regression models and correlation analyses were used to answer the research questions. Results: Motor speed did not explain a significant amount of variance in the TMT outcome measure (p = .821). Additionally, there was no significant correlation between the TMT and CST outcome measures (p = .68). A strong correlation between a CST motor variable and motor speed as measured through the FTT was found (r = -.70; p = <.001). Conclusions: There were no issues regarding the remote and digital testing set-up. The results revealed that, contrary to expectation, motor speed was not associated with TMT performance. Also, TMT performance and CST performance were not correlated, indicating that the tests are not interchangeable. The CST has, however, proven to be able to control for speed.","['Digital Trail Making Test, Digital Concept Shifting Task, Remote Neuropsychological Assessment, TMT motor speed, Teleneuropsychology']"

The Relationship Between Living Situation and Well-Being in Students with Autism,"Stokkel, Emile",['Prof. dr. Willem van der Does'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Students with autism report higher rates of depression and anxiety and are more likely to drop out of higher education compared to their neurotypical peers. Students with autism can benefit from support provided by the university, but effective support requires an understanding of their specific needs. Little is known about how the living situation of students with autism affects their well-being. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between living situation and mental well-being of students with autism. Data were gathered using an online survey. Participants were 221 university students, 58 of whom reported a diagnosis of autism. They completed questionnaires regarding their living situation, and feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. A relationship was found between living situation and loneliness. Students with autism reported feeling less lonely when living alone compared to living with flatmates, but not compared to living with parents. students without an autism diagnosis reported feeling less lonely when living alone, compared to both living with flatmates and living with their parents. The self-report nature of the questionnaire limits the validity of the gathered data. Selection bias as a result of the snowball sampling method make for limited generalisability: the members of the target population that are the most isolated may be more difficult to reach with this method. Another limitation is that the data only shows a correlation, not a causal effect between the studied variables. The study found that students with autism who live alone report less feelings of loneliness compared to living with flatmates. A future study that follows a cohort of autistic students before they enrol at a university and throughout their first years of university could provide insight into a possible causal relationship. If it is found that living alone improves the well-being of students with autism, accommodations could be provided.",

In this thesis, a meta-analysis was performed to examine the relationship between reading behaviour and receptive vocabulary, expressive vocabulary, combined vocabulary and reading comprehension in primary and secondary school students. A total number of 30 studies (4.769 students) were included. As expected, a medium to large effect was found for all four outcome measures. This is in line with results from previous research. Since girls happen to read more and more often than boys, it was expected that gender would be a significant predictor of the effects. This hypothesis was not confirmed in this meta-analysis. This may be explained by the fact that the reported gender percentages in the respective studies were not similar to the actual gender distribution in the final analyses. Researchers sometimes reported that participants were excluded in the analysis of our variables of interest, without stating the exact number of boys and girls. Overall, this study confirms that reading plays a positive role in acquiring vocabulary and reading comprehension.","['meta-analysis', 'print exposure checklist', 'vocabulary', 'reading comprehension', 'primary and secondary school students']"

As immigration is at the forefront of the world’s agenda, a burgeoning literature is interested in exploring the drivers of public attitudes toward immigrants. The scholarly literature mainly focusses on two sources of immigration attitudes: economic and cultural threat perceptions. However, these studies generally focus on developed countries, even though there are similar levels of migration in developing countries. This study addresses this sample bias by conducting a large-N observational analysis of the effect of economic and cultural threat perceptions on public attitudes toward immigrants in developing countries. Furthermore, this study conducts a second analysis to explore how countries’ development status affects the relationship between economic or cultural threat and immigration attitudes. The findings suggest that perceptions of economic and cultural threat are important explanatory factors for citizens’ immigration attitudes in developing countries. Moreover, the second analysis indicates that both economic and cultural threat have a stronger effect on immigration attitudes in developed countries than in developing countries. Taken together, these findings reinforce the relevance of the existing economic and cultural threat theories and shed light on the formation of public attitudes toward immigrants in developing countries.","['immigration attitudes, economic threat, cultural threat, politics of immigration']"

The dog’s ‘fake pupil’: The influence of humans on a dog’s appearance,"Tjioe, Michelle","['Kret, M.E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The human-canine bond exists for over 15,00 years ago, when humans began to socialize the European wolf-dogs. The influence of humans on the appearance of dogs created the extraordinary variety of phenotypic diversity among the modern dog. Humans seem to be particularly interested in certain paedomorphic features in animals, such as a round face and large pupils, which is related to the Kindchenschema. Remarkably, one of the characteristics in dogs is an extra dark colouring around the pupil which seems to create an enlarging effect of the existing pupil. This so-called ring might be part of the human influence within the domestication of the modern dog. As well as a higher contrast between the iris and the ring, which creates a more visible ring and therefore strengthens the influence of the ring. The current study hypothesized and expected that 1) the ring is a predictor of the level of perceived cuteness in humans, 2) contrast is a moderator of this relationship and 3) attitude is correlated with the level of perceived cuteness. The 1100 participants were asked to rate 36 pictures of dogs on cuteness via an online questionnaire. The results showed that the larger the ring, the higher the level of perceived cuteness, as well as a positive correlation between attitude and the level of perceived cuteness. However, the contrast between the ring and the iris did not influence the relationship between the ratio ring/iris and the level of perceived cuteness. These results carefully confirm the influence of humans on a dog’s appearance. Future research could focus on gazing as a predictor of perceived cuteness, including isolating the eyes as presented stimuli.","['human-canine bond', 'Kindchenschema', 'pupils', 'perceived cuteness']"
"Women’s Variations in Mood Symptoms and their Interaction with Menstrual Cycle Phase, Oral Contraceptive Use and Personality Traits","Scalpello, Lisa Ms",['Ellen De Bruijn'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. This study was undertaken to determine whether symptoms of depression, stress and anxiety vary between naturally cycling (NC) women and women who use oral contraceptives (OCs), as well as the potential influence of personality traits, particularly emotional stability, on these variations. Methods. Standard psychological instruments assessing mood symptoms and personality traits, as well as a questionnaire regarding menstrual cycle and OC use were completed online by 266 women (133 OC, 133 NC) between the ages of 18 and 35. Correlation analyses and multivariate analyses of variance were used to determine the associations between these variables. Results. No statistically significant difference was found in scores of depression (D), stress (S) and anxiety (A) between OC and NC women (D; p=0.47, S; p=0.55, A; p=0.93). All three measures of mood showed a significant negative correlation with emotional stability (all p values <.001, D; r= -.32, S; r=-.44, S; r= -.46). However, no statistically significant difference was found between OC and NC women on the combined measures of depression, stress and anxiety when controlling for low emotional stability (p=.201). Conclusion. Low emotional stability is associated with heightened mood symptoms, however, there is no difference in these associations or mood symptom severity between NC women and OC women. This is in contrast with widespread beliefs and perceptions about OC use, as well as some scientific literature, although there still remains inconsistent evidence within the literature regarding which women experience negative side effects due to OC and why.","['Oral Contraceptives', 'Menstrual Cycle', 'Mood', 'Personality']"

The effect of three exposure-based treatments on comorbid disorders amongst individuals with childhood abuse-related PTSD,"Inglis, Tessa",['Marie-Louise Kullberg'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Variants of exposure-based therapy have been found to be effective in ameliorating childhood abuse-related post-traumatic stress disorder (CA-PTSD). This study aims to investigate whether three variants of Prolonged Exposure (PE) improve comorbid depressive symptoms, suicidality and personality disorders amongst patients with CA-PTSD. Data from the IMPACT study was used, which included 149 participants who were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: PE, intensified PE (iPE) or Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation followed by PE (STAIR+PE). Participants were assessed at multiple time points ranging from baseline to 12-month follow-up. Linear mixed effect models were utilized to test the effect of treatment on depressive symptoms, suicide risk, personality disorder symptom severity and the prevalence of diagnosed personality disorders. Such models were then extended to test whether the three variants of PE differed in their treatment effects. The findings demonstrated that treatment led to large improvements in depressive symptoms and suicide risk from baseline assessment to 12-month follow-up. Moreover, personality disorder symptom severity and the prevalence of diagnosed personality disorders significantly declined between baseline and 6-month follow-up. It was found that PE, iPE and STAIR+PE did not differ in their treatment effects, implying that deviations from the original PE protocol do not lead to superior treatment outcomes. In conclusion, variants of exposure- based therapy lead to sustained improvements in comorbid psychopathologies amongst patients with CA-PTSD.","['PTSD', 'childhood abuse', 'comorbid psychopathology', 'exposure-based therapy', 'prolonged exposure']"
"Intra- and Interpersonal Consequences of Social Anxiety Disorder on the Physiological, Behavioral, and Psychological Level","Zavaro Dalva, Rayka","['Folz, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a disorder characterized by impairments in interpersonal functioning such as experiencing difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships. These impairments have negative intrapersonal consequences for individuals with SAD on different levels such as the physiological, behavioral, and psychological level. A newer perspective on SAD has suggested that it also negatively impacts the interaction partner (i.e. interpersonal consequences of the disorder). According to this perspective, certain verbal and nonverbal behaviors and thought or feeling content of the healthy interaction partner are affected while interacting with an individual who have SAD. The current study investigated the intra- and interpersonal consequences of SAD on the physiological, behavioral, and psychological level during initial interactions. Participants played a dyadic trust game (23 same-gender dyads) while their electrodermal activity (EDA) was continuously measured and filled in self-report measures during and after the game. The dyads consisted either of one participant scoring high on social anxiety (SA) and one low on SA (i.e. SA dyads) or two participants scoring low on SA (i.e. control dyads). EDA was used as the measure on the physiological level, participants’ trust ratings were the measure on the behavioral level, and the discrepancy between self and partner reports on positive/negative personal attributes to explore cognitive biases was the measure on the psychological level. We expected to observe higher EDA synchrony, lower trust ratings, and higher discrepancy between self and partner reports in SA dyads compared to control dyads. Results showed no difference between dyads on all levels indicating that we were not able to observe the predicted effect of finding intra- and interpersonal consequences of SAD in SA dyads. The most important implication of the current study is that, it included three different levels of SAD, in contrast to earlier studies that mainly focused on one level. This provides a useful example for how future studies might be designed and conducted.","['social anxiety disorder', 'emotional contagion', 'trust', 'physiological synchrony', 'electrodermal activity', 'cognitive biases']"

Human recognition of deepfake videos: Can we still believe what we see?,"Nas, Ewout","['Kleijn, R.E. de']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Deepfake videos are highly realistic manipulated videos, blurring the line between what is real and fake. Deepfakes are generated with neural networks. The technology rapidly evolves, making deepfake videos increasingly realistic. This makes it more difficult for humans to distinguish deepfake videos from real videos. Studies show that a large proportion of people are not familiar with deepfakes. Next, studies show that familiarity with a person portrayed on a deepfake video plays a role in detection performance. One of the threats deepfake technology brings is generating realistic fake news. The technology can be used go generate highly realistic fake news, which brings significant threats to society. This raises questions about the human recognition of deepfake videos. Most research on deepfake videos is focused on the algorithmic detection of deepfakes. Less is known about the human recognition of deepfake videos. The aim of the current study is to investigate the human performance at recognizing deepfake videos, and its possible predictors. It is hypothesized that social media use, conspiracy mentality, age and familiarity with a person portrayed on a deepfake are correlated to the human performance at recognizing deepfake videos. Our findings suggest that humans perform better at recognizing deepfake videos of familiar persons compared to deepfakes of unfamiliar persons. Next, our findings suggest a positive relationship between time spent on social media and performance at recognizing deepfake videos. No significant correlations were found between age, conspiracy mentality and deepfake detection performance.","['deepfake videos', 'deepfakes', 'human-computer interaction', 'fake news']"
The Effect of Outcome Expectancies on Pain Tolerance,"Maanders, Ludovic","['Veldhuijzen, D.S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Chronic pain occurs in 23% of the Dutch adult population. Psychological factors like expectancies of pain play a big role in pain and methods that can make these expectancies more positive could greatly improve a patient his quality of life. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between manipulated outcome expectancies and pain. It was hypothesised that a positive outcome expectancy would result in a higher tolerance of pain. 61 healthy students were randomly divided into two groups, where one group received the positive outcome expectancy manipulation and the other group the control manipulation. This was done by presenting information via a computer screen of which the participants believed was about their psychological factors based on a pain test and a questionnaire, but was only based on the group to which the participant was allocated. Pain tolerance was measured using the Cold Pressor Test, where the participant had to hold his/her hand in the water bath for as long as possible and the duration was the measurement for pain tolerance. Both groups showed equal outcome expectancies, p = .193, which means the manipulation was unsuccessful and both groups had the same belief on how well they could tolerate pain. Unsurprisingly, the total amount of time spent in the CPT between the conditions was also the same, p = .988. The research question remains unanswered as the outcome expectancy manipulation was ineffective. A successful manipulation is needed which could be achieved by telling participants face-to-face by a researcher that they are expected to handle pain well, as this might be more convincing and more effective to increase outcome expectancy. Future research could focus on this aspect. This study has gained insight into the possibility that a manipulation via a computer presentation might not be effective enough to induce a positive outcome expectancy.","['Outcome Expectancy', 'Pain Tolerance', 'Cold Pressor Test', 'Computer Manipulation.']"

The Need for Affiliation as a Motivation to Inititate Conflict,"Schröder, Ana-Rosa","['Pliskin, R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"While initiating a conflict can sometimes lead to maximizing ingroup gains, it comes at high costs for the individual. Nevertheless, certain individuals are motivated to do so. The individual’s need for affiliation might influence this because people high in the need for affiliation find good interpersonal relations important and want to benefit the ingroup (McClelland, 1961). This study hypothesizes that a high need for affiliation compared to a low need for affiliation increases the likelihood of investing in outgroup harm and thus initiating conflict. Participants (N = 126) engaged in the Intergroup Prisoner’s Dilemma-Maximizing Difference (IPD-MD) game with modifications of efficiency (Halevy et al., 2008). They responded to the six-item Unified Motive Scale (UMS-6) measure of the need for affiliation (Schönbrodt & Gerstenberg, 2012). Opposite to the hypothesis, the findings showed that a low need for affiliation predicted inclinations for initiating conflict if initiating conflict maximized the gains for the ingroup. Surprisingly, thriving for maximum gains for the ingroup motivated people with a low need for affiliation to initiate conflict but not people with a high need for affiliation. Possibly, the increased need to be cooperative amongst people high in the need for affiliation also comprises the outgroup (Halevy et al., 2008), inhibiting people high in the need for affiliation to initiate conflict. This work suggests that alternative individual differences, like ingroup identification, should be studied to enhance understanding of why, when and by whom conflict gets initiated.","['need for affiliation, affiliation motivation, conflict initiation, efficiency']"

In addition, other studies have found that these traumatic experiences of parents can lead to poor parenting skills and subsequently to parenting stress, making the parent less emotionally available to the child. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of parents’ childhood trauma and parenting stress on externalizing problem behavior, consisting of delinquent behavior and reduced school performance, in children aged 8-18 years. Besides the direct relations between childhood trauma of parents on externalizing problem behavior in children, this study aims to investigate whether there is a mediating or moderating role of parenting stress in the relationship between childhood trauma of parents and externalizing problem behavior in children. The sample of this study consists of families (N = 481) who are supervised by Veilig Thuis because of child abuse or partner violence. Two types of multiple regression analyses were performed, namely mediation and moderation analyses. Direct connections have been found between parenting stress and externalizing problem behavior in children. The analyses found no mediating or moderating role of parenting stress and no direct connections between childhood trauma of parents and externalizing problem behavior in adolescents. Based on this study, it can be concluded that parenting stress is a predictor of externalizing problem behavior in children. Results of this study can contribute to the development or adaptation of interventions aimed at parenting stress in order to prevent or reduce delinquent behavior and reduced school performance in children.","['Externaliserend probleemgedrag bij jongeren', 'Jeugdtrauma van ouders', 'Opvoedstress van ouders']"

The current study assesses whether a multi-component CBT-based sleep mood intervention, the SMILE intervention, is effective in reducing insomnia severity among university students compared to a waitlist control group and whether this effect is mediated by cognitive processes. This is to further understand the underlying mechanisms of the intervention and clarify if these cognitive processes need to be targeted in treatment. The study design was a randomized controlled trial. The efficacy of the SMILE intervention was analysed in an intervention (n = 23) and control group (n = 12) at pre-and post-test. Participants received four weeks of group therapy, combined with CBT, lifestyle guidance and mindfulness. Secondly, a mediation analysis was performed with cognitive processes, specifically dysfunctional beliefs and pre-sleep arousal as mediators, to study the mechanism between the SMILE intervention and insomnia severity. The results indicate that the SMILE intervention group is significant and effective compared to the control group with F (1, 33) = 5.91, p < .05 in treating insomnia severity. Also, dysfunctional beliefs mediate this effect with b = 1.12, [-2.58; -.06]. However, pre- sleep arousal did not with b = -.68, [-2.13; .05]. Overall, these results show that a multi- component intervention for students is efficacious in reducing insomnia severity and that dysfunctional beliefs is a mediator in this effect. It is implicated to further research on cognitive processes and their underlying mechanisms in a larger sample.","['Insomnia', 'University students', 'Randomized controlled trial', 'Dysfunctional beliefs', 'Pre-sleep arousal']"

These behavioral problems in childhood are a predictor for several problems in later adolescence and adulthood. Studies that examine the underlying mechanisms that play a role in the development of problem behavior can contribute to the development of adequate and effective (preventive) interventions, so that early intervention can be applied. The current study examined the role of physical discipline, ethnicity and attachment in the development of problem behavior in children aged 0-7 years in family residential clinics. The sample consisted of 50 parent-child dyads (Mage children = 3,28 years) recruited in four Dutch family residential clinics. The families had been referred to these clinics for an evaluation of their parenting capacities in the context of a decision regarding out-of-home placement or reunification with their child(ren). The pre-test consisted of a two-hour appointment in a lab setting at the clinic. During this appointment a number of questionnaires and tasks were administered to parent and child. In addition, the family’s therapist filled out a short questionnaire about the family. Physical discipline was observed during a “don’t touch” and “clean up” task and then scored on a 5-point Likert-scale. The preschool Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to assess child’s behavioral problems. Child’s attachment was measured using the Infant Coding System (ICS) and the MacArthur Preschool Attachment Classification System (PACS). The results showed that physical discipline is not related to child’s problem behavior and that ethnicity does not moderate this association. In addition, the results showed that child’s attachment does not play a mediating role in the association between physical discipline and child’s problem behavior. Future research will benefit from the use of multi-informant measures and should include more ethnicities.","['Gezinspsychiatrische kliniek', 'Fysiek disciplineren', 'Etniciteit', 'Gehechtheid kind', 'Probleemgedrag']"
Feit of fabel? Ook kinderen geloven in neuromythes,"Dijkstra, Tess",['Jolles D.'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Neuromyths can be described as a misreading, misunderstanding, or a misquoting of scientific facts by brain research though which a misconception is generated. These misconceptions are used in education and other contexts. The believe in neuromyths by teachers has been extensively researched and concluded that many misconceptions about the brain still exist amongst educators. Yet, there is still a lack of research on the believe in neuromyths by students. The present study examined if Dutch students between 10 and 15 years old believe in neuromyths and if this depended on curiosity and selfestimated knowledge about the brain. 339 participants filled out an online survey in which data on background knowledge was collected as well as answers on the different statements that were either a brain fact or a neuromyth. Results show that on average, students believed about 48% of neuromyhts and about 77% of the brain facts were answered correctly. The neuromyths that were most believed were related to learning styles, brain dominance, the existence of a math or language gyrus (“wiskundeknobbel” or “taalknobbel” in Dutch), brain training games and multitasking. This study also found that when more general knowledge (brain facts) statements were answered correctly, less neuromyth statements were answered correctly. When students scored higher on curiosity, less statements on neuromyths were answered correctly. This suggests that students who are in general more curious find it more difficult to distinguish neuromyths from brain facts. Self-estimated brain knowledge did not predict the score on the neuromyths and brainfacts. Further research must be done on the believe in neuromyths for this target group as well as research on practical implications of believing in neuromyths.",['neuromyths children']

Furthermore, we examined if this relationship is moderated by the temperament of the infant. The caregiving attitude of the professional caregivers was measured with the Parenting attitude Questionnaire (PAQ; Hembacher & Frank, 2016). The infant’s well-being was assessed with the Leiden Inventory for the Child’s Well-being in Day Care (WOL; De Schipper, et al., 2004). Stability was measured by a questionnaire designed by Leiden University to reflect on the stability of the caregiver. Temperament was measured by the Infant Behavior Questionnaire- Revised (IBQ-R; Garnstein & Rothbart, 2003). There was no significant association between sensitive caregiving attitude of a professional caregiver, caregiver stability and the wellbeing of an infant in day care. Also, we did not find evidence that temperament served as a moderator. Interestingly we did find that stability of a trusted caregiver mattered more than the sensitive attitude of the caregiver in explaining individual differences in infants’ wellbeing, although this association was not significant. Further research may explore the difference between caregiver stability and a sensitive caregiver attitude in predicting the well-being of an infant and as well as the moderation by temperament by using a larger sample than in the current study.","['opvoedattitude van de pedagogisch medewerker', 'stabiliteit van de zorg voor baby’s', 'welbevinden', 'temperament']"

The current study examines the psychological consequences for victims of undesired behavior at work when passive bystanders are present. In our retrospective study, we assessed cognitions, fulfillment of needs, and emotions (PANAS) after participants’ previous experiences of undesired behavior at work. We expected victims who were in presence of passive bystanders to blame their selves more, and to blame the perpetrator less, comparing to victims in presence of active bystanders. Also, we expected them to experience more negative emotions, and their needs to be less fulfilled. As expected, victims who were in presence of active bystanders felt a higher need to belong, and for meaningful existence. However, other expectations were not supported. Our results support the idea that passive behavior of bystanders in a situation of undesired behavior raises a feeling of social exclusion, which suggests a parallel to ostracism.",

Children who exhibit externalizing problem behaviour are at high risk of becoming involved in the criminal justice system. Insights into factors that may influence the development of externalizing problem behaviour in children can prevent negative consequences of this behaviour later in life. Significantly better performance intelligence than verbal intelligence (PIQ > VIQ discrepancies) and impairments in social cognition are hypothesized to underlie excessive externalizing problem behaviour. Methods. Participants were 5- to 16-year-old children at high risk of developing criminal behaviour (N = 97, 12.4% with a PIQ > VIQ discrepancy). Children were recruited through an early identification project and selected based on borderline and clinical scores on the Teacher’s Report Form (TRF). Data was collected using the TRF, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and ‘Sociaal Cognitieve Vaardigheden Test’. Results. The results on the Independent Samples T-tests showed that children with a PIQ > VIQ discrepancy do not differ from children with a VIQ > PIQ discrepancy in the amount of externalizing problem behaviour and social cognition. Additionally, the regression analysis found that social cognition was not a significant predictor of externalizing problem behaviour, regardless of the type of discrepancy. Conclusion. In general, children with externalizing problem behaviour have a below average intelligence, regardless of their intelligence profile. Furthermore, VIQ-PIQ discrepancies are unrelated to externalizing problem behaviour and social cognition and therefore psychologists should be hesitant in assuming such a relationship in diagnostic practices. Moreover, no relationship was found between social cognition and externalizing problem behaviour in these children. It is recommended to leave the influence of discrepancies out of consideration in young children and to investigate whether or not specific aspects of both verbal comprehension abilities and visual-spatial information processing skills are associated with externalizing problem behaviour and social cognition in children at risk of developing criminal behaviour.",

At the same time, raising children to successfully participate in society can be quite a challenge for future mothers. This is why the main focus of the current research was to examine the relationship of two parental factors: parental self-efficacy and social support, and the child factor: the degree of aggression in children. The participants of this study were 204 future mothers (M age= 22.54 years, SD= 2.25) and their children (M age= 20.25 months, SD= 1.67). The future mothers filled in two questionnaires about their perceived social support and their parental self-efficacy. Once their child was aged 20 months, the mother filled in a questionnaire about the degree of aggression observed in their children. The results show that parental self-efficacy, in contrary to social support, is an important predictor for aggression in children aged 20 months. The perceived social support is not, separate or combined with parental self-efficacy, a predictor for aggression. This concludes the importance of supporting future mothers in their route to parenthood. It will be of great importance to increase the parental self-efficacy and through that contribute to the well-being of mothers, children and society. Future research could help this goal by examining the effectiveness of a variety of intervention on the parental self-efficacy.","['Parental self-efficacy', 'social support', 'agressive behavior']"
Framing a pandemic: How the political affiliation of British newspapers influenced their news coverage of the Covid-19 crisis,"Leuker, Melina","['Rrustemi, A.R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This paper examines online newspaper articles related to the Covid-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, in order to analyse how the political affiliation of said newspapers influence which frames they choose to employ. Drawing on framing theory, this thesis analyses 50 articles that were published by a conservative newspaper and 50 articles that were published by a liberal newspaper. The data consists of 100 articles that were published by The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph between 1 January 2020 and 1 March 2022. Content analysis is used to identify the different frames, such as economic or health-related frames, in order to establish a connection between certain frames and the political affiliation of the paper. Furthermore does this paper aim to assess the media’s role in the policy cycle. The main findings of this paper were that 44% of the analysed articles use the Health Risk Frame while 24% used the Economic Frame and 32% used neither. The Health Risk Frame was used more often by the liberal Guardian (29 times) and The Economic Frame was used more often by the conservative Telegraph (13 times). Additionally, these findings suggest that media framing can play a crucial role in the agenda-setting and evaluation part of the policy cycle","['Framing, COVID-19, Newspapers']"

The effect of palliative care training on the level of self-efficacy of health care professionals treating patients with COPD,"Kwant, Sonja",['J. Veldhuijzen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Health care professionals are crucial in providing palliative care for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. These patients are referred less often to palliative care services than patients with other terminal diseases. Health care professionals are often reluctant to initiate palliative care as they are unsure whether they can implement it adequately. Few studies have looked at the effect of a palliative care training on the level of self-efficacy of the health care professionals. This study investigated whether an intervention with the use of simulations can increase the level of self-efficacy regarding the palliative care they provide. Additionally, the effect of self-efficacy on palliative care measures, such as the amount and duration of advanced care planning conversations with patients, and the amount of collaboration and consultation with other health care professionals was investigated. This study was a randomised cluster-controlled trial that applied a hybrid design type 2 which took part in eight hospital regions around The Netherlands. Four of the hospital regions were in the control group and four were in the intervention group. In total, 93 doctors, nurses, and palliative care consultants participated. The intervention consisted of two evening courses with information about palliative care and simulations with actors so that conversations with patients could be practiced. Additionally, a tool for recognising when palliative care needs to be initiated was offered, and extra meetings with their project managers to see if palliative care was implemented as intended. Self-efficacy was measured with the End-of-Life Professional Caregiver Survey at three time points, before intervention, five months after the interventions, and fifteen months after the intervention. An unstructured multilevel mixed model showed an increase of self-efficacy over Time for both the intervention and control group (p < .001) and an interaction between Group and Time (p < .001) indicating that the intervention group had a greater increase of self-efficacy over time compared to the control group. A Spearman Rho test showed that self-efficacy is correlated with the amount of advanced care planning conversations that are held with the patient (ρ(80) = .31, p = .004). Additionally, a Pearson correlation showed that self-efficacy is correlated with the amount of collaboration with other health care professionals (r(81) = .32, p = .003). No significant correlation was found between the level of self-efficacy and the duration of the advanced care planning conversations and the number of consultations with other health care professionals. Thus, this intervention was successful in increasing self-efficacy of health care professionals over time and that self-efficacy is correlated with some of the identified palliative care measures. A palliative care intervention can help health care professionals to feel more confident about their skills and offer better care to patients with COPD.","['Palliative care', 'palliative care training', 'COPD', 'self-efficacy', 'health care professionals', 'HCP']"

The Impact of Dysfunctional Parenting on Pro-Social Behaviour and the Role of Parent and Child Gender,"Schwering, Hannah","['Wierenga, L.M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present study examined the relationship between dysfunctional parenting and pro-social behaviour in children and analysed the role of parent and child gender in this. A total of 238 children participated in the Pro-social Cyberball Game, which is an experimental task to measure pro-social behaviour. Their primary parents completed the Parenting Scale, a questionnaire to assess use of dysfunctional parenting practices. A general linear model was performed. Differences in pro-social behaviour between boys and girls were examined and no significant difference was found. Contrary to our hypothesis which stated that more dysfunctional parenting would be related to less pro-social children, results were not significant. We examined this effect in several groups: comparing primary parents who are male to those who are female, and comparing families where primary parent and child belong to the same gender (same-gender dyads) to families where primary parent and child were of opposite gender (mixed-gender dyads). In our sample there was no difference in the way a parent influences his/her child’s pro-social behaviour, between mothers and fathers. Also, there was no difference in the effect of dysfunctional parenting on child’s pro-social behaviour, between same-gender and mixed-gender dyads. The present study contributes to clarifying alleged boy-girl and father-mother differences in pro-social behaviour and the effect of dysfunctional parenting on pro-sociality. The discussion reviewed the influence of gender norms in parenting and child behaviour and implications of these results.","['pro-social behaviour', 'dysfunctional parenting', 'gender', 'primary parent', 'maternal and paternal', 'gender norms']"

The verbal transmission of stranger anxiety from parents to children,"Jagbandhan, Biyanka","['Aktar, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Verbal parental transmission of threat information about strangers may influence fear beliefs and avoidance responses in children. Earlier studies showed that sharing threat information with children caused higher levels in fear beliefs and higher avoidance responses compared to when safe information was shared. There is proof that fearful temperament/behavioral inhibition (BI), moderate the relation between children receiving threat information and scoring higher on fear beliefs and avoidance responses. In this study, parents provided threat and safe information about two strangers to their children (N = 72, Mage = 11.67). Following the manipulation, children went through three social tasks twice with each of the strangers and reported fear beliefs in a questionnaire for each stranger. Avoidance behavior was observed in the social tasks. Fearful temperament was used as an individual difference predictor and was measured by the Early Adult Temperament Questionnaire. Verbal transmission of threat information was linked to higher fear belief scores compared to safe information. Verbal transmission of threat information was not linked to higher avoidance behavior responses. The fear beliefs outcomes and the behavioral responses were not affected by fearful temperament. This study only found proof that verbal parental transmission of threat information about strangers increased children’s’ fear beliefs and may increase the risks of developing SAD. This study has his strengths and limitations regarding the procedure and chosen measurements, but hopefully gives new inspiration to new or follow-up research about verbal parental transmission of threat information about strangers and the effects on children.","['Parental verbal transmission', 'SAD', 'stranger anxiety', 'children', 'fear beliefs', 'avoidance behavior', 'fearful temperament']"
"De invloeden van sociaal-demografische, prenatale en perinatale factoren op de taalontwikkeling van adolescenten met het Coffin Siris Syndroom","Kreijsig, Noëlle","['Huijbregts, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"The aim of this study was to investigate which socio-demographic, prenatal and perinatal factors predict the language development of adolescents with Coffin Siris Syndrome, which has been associated with a language delay. Various specific factors were examined in relation to verbal ability (language), including gender, maternal substance use, parental educational level, birth complications and gestational age. A total of 34 participants took part in this study. 50% female and 50% male, with a mean age of 18.26 (SD = 11.80). The participants were part of a patient database at the Leiden University Medical Center. To measure the language level of the adolescents with the parents filled in a questionnaire with 7 questions about the developmental domain of language. In this questionnaire the gender, the mother's substance use, the education level of the parents, the birth complications and the gestational age were also assessed based on 16 questions. Independent t-tests were performed to find out the differences in language level between boys and girls, substance use and no substance use, highly and poorly educated parents and whether birth complications are involved. A single regression was performed to find out whether gestational age affected language level. Finally, a multiple regression was performed to determine which factor was the strongest predictor for language level. The independent t-tests show that there is no significant difference between the language level of the boys and the language level of the girls. Second, there is no significant difference between the language level of the adolescents of the mothers with substance use and adolescents of the mothers without substance use. There is also no significant difference between the language level of adolescents of low and highly educated parents. Furthermore, there is no significant difference between the language level of adolescents with birth complications and without birth complications. Finally, simple regression showed that gestational age is not a significant predictor for language level. Due to the absence of significant differences, the multiple regression was not performed. Overall, gender, maternal substance uses during pregnancy, parental education, birth complications, and gestational age do not affect language development in adolescents with CSS. The factors do not predict the language level of the adolescents with CSS. For follow-up research, the inclusion of a well-matched control group would improve the study. It is then examined whether the adolescents with CSS deviate in linguistic development. Furthermore, the addition of a standardized instrument, such as the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, could provide predictive factors. Finally, the application of continuous variables or another classification in low-high can also make a positive contribution to the predictive value of the various factors.",
Mobile Phone-Based Alcohol Interventions for Adult Problem Drinking: A Meta-Analysis,"Priestley, Kira","['Henrich, J.F.', 'Riper, H.', 'Schulte, M.H.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background Worldwide, problem drinking is a leading risk factor for disease burden and mortality. To reduce this burden, effective interventions are required. Mobile phone-based alcohol interventions show promise due to their ease of use and scalability. However, there is limited knowledge regarding their overall effectiveness. As it is a rapidly developing field, this meta-analysis captures the current state of evidence. Mobile phone-based alcohol interventions are expected to be more effective than control groups with minimal or no intervention. Methods A systematic literature search and meta-analysis were conducted following PRISMA guidelines. In April 2022 the databases PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched to identify eligible studies. The search focused on publications between 2010 and 2022, without language restrictions. Randomised controlled trials comparing mobile phone-based interventions with minimal or no intervention control conditions were included. Studies with interventions tailored to students and pregnant women were excluded. Outcome data were extracted and the pooled effect size was calculated with a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and quality of evidence with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Results Five studies with 1672 participants were included and revealed a combined small effect size (Hedges’ g = -0.28, 95% CI [-0.76, 0.21]), which was insignificant (p = .19). Intervention duration and mode of delivery did not have a significant moderating effect on the outcome. Between-study heterogeneity was high and influence analyses revealed one study potentially overly contributing to the heterogeneity. There was no evidence of publication bias. Risk of bias was considered to be high for each study and the overall quality of evidence was judged to be low. Conclusion The current study found no support for the efficacy of mobile phone-based alcohol intervention compared to minimal or no intervention control groups to reduce adult problem drinking. These results should be interpreted cautiously due to the small number of studies and concerns regarding the quality of evidence. Future researchers should consider using a standard set of outcome measures to make findings in this area more comparable.","['problem drinking', 'alcohol consumption', 'mobile interventions', 'text messaging', 'smartphone applications', 'mHealth']"
A Novel Design to Reduce Reaction Times to Take-Over Requests During Automated Driving,"Jónsson, Pétur Örn","['Walker, F.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In level 3 automated vehicles, drivers are not required to pay attention to the road but are still expected to respond quickly to a Take Over Request (TOR) in unexpected conditions. As this presents a danger to road safety, exploring design solutions for the TOR is imperative. Research has shown that reaction times can be made faster by manipulating the perceived ownership of an avatar by making it glow in synchrony with a participant’s physiology. Interestingly, this effect was increased for those with high empathy. We investigated whether this manipulation could be used to reduce reaction times to a TOR. Furthermore, we investigated whether reaction times would decrease more in those with high empathy and whether the manipulation would increase perceived ownership of the vehicle, as measured by a self-identification questionnaire. Participants were in a driving simulation in virtual reality, where ambient lighting pulsed around them in synchrony with their breathing. Unfortunately, the results found did not support our hypothesis. There was not enough evidence to conclude that visuo-respiratory synchronization facilitates faster responses to a TOR in a Level 3 automated vehicle. In line with these results, we did not find evidence of self-identification with the vehicle after visuo-respiratory synchronization. However, we found promising results about the relationship between empathy and reaction times during visuo-respiratory synchronization. A post hoc analysis revealed a clear negative relationship. As empathy increased, reaction times to the TOR decreased, indicating that the effect of our manipulation increased as empathy got higher.","['Automated Driving', 'take over request (TOR)', 'peripersonal space', 'ambient lighting', 'manual take over', 'empathy', 'interoception', 'Level 3']"
The Effect of Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation on The Locus Coreulus – Noradrenaline System,"Cook, Paul",['Dr. Franz Wurm'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Recent research by Sharon et al. (2020) indicated an activating effect of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on the locus coreleus noradrenergic (LC-NA) system. Given the mixed findings of previous research, we replicated this study to validate and extend their results. Twenty-one subjects participated in a repeated measures design using the same no-task paradigm as Sharon et al. (2020). Additionally, we extended the analysis to explore indicators of LC-NA activity in the EEG time domain. We compared EEG activity between sham (earlobe) and stimulation (cymba conchae) conditions. Our analysis found significantly less alpha activity during taVNS compared to sham stimulation. This confirms the finding of Sharon et al. (2020) - taVNS attenuates alpha oscillations. However, we found no differences in ERPs between conditions. This was likely due to methodological limitations that make the design inappropriate for ERP research. Our results support an effect of taVNS on phasic LC-NA activity, but the effect on tonic LC-NA remains unknown. This is discussed from the perspective of using taVNS as an intervention for disorders such as ADHD. Based on our exploratory analysis and literature findings, recommendations are made for future research.","['Locus Coreulus', 'Noradrenaline', 'Norepinephrine', 'LC-NA', 'LC-NE', 'ADHD', 'vagus nerve', 'VNS', 'tVNS', 'taVNS', 'active gain theory', 'EEG', 'alpha desynchronization']"

A randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of training with NeuroTrackerX on (cognitive) performance. Participants were tested on their performance on a complex flying task with subtasks and cognitive tasks before and after training with either NeuroTrackerX or a control training. It was concluded that the performance of all participants improved on some tasks, but there was no difference between the two experimental groups. There was also no difference present between the groups on both subjective and physical stress levels during execution of the tasks. Post hoc analyses showed that participants that trained with NeuroTrackerX who showed more improvement on the training also showed more improvement on a subtask. Future research with more participants, and in a more controlled training setting should investigate this result further. Furthermore, future studies using (aspirant) military pilots might be better able to detect the effects of NeuroTrackerX training on more stressful tasks. Nevertheless, according to the findings of this study it is concluded that the NeuroTrackerX training does not lead to cognitive enhancement.",
Eye gaze during a phrase: A paper about eye gaze frequency toward different virtual audience sizes and attitudes via a screen display to develop a training program for non-diagnosed public speaking anxiety.,"Dolk, Isa","['Fasya, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper provides new insight in the influence of the audience size and audience attitudes on the eye gaze frequency toward the audience via a screen display to develop a training program for non-diagnosed public speaking anxiety. Previous studies mostly used virtual reality head-mounted displays and focused on a clinical sample, where this paper focuses on a non-clinical sample. Forty-four adults that participated met the requirement of speaking English as a second language. They filled in a Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety (PRPSA) questionnaire and gave a public speech about movies. The speech was given in front of a small audience of two people or a big audience of six people where they received encouraging or critical feedback depending on the condition they got randomly assigned to. During the speech, the eye gaze of the participant was measured to find out if they made more or less eye contact in the different conditions. The results indicated that participants had more frequent eye gaze toward the audience in the big audience condition compared to the small audience condition, independent of the audience’s appearance and the participant’s PRPSA scores. The eye gaze frequency toward the audience plus looking at the background of the screen (nowhere) resulted in the total screen time (100%). The results of this paper lead to the conclusion that a non-clinical form of virtual exposure training could be helpful to decrease fear of public speaking in the general population when audience size is controlled.","['Eye Gaze, Virtual Audience Sizes, Attitudes, Screen Display, Non-Diagnostic Public Speaking Anxiet, Treatmenty']"
"The influence of sex, puberty and giftedness on fear extinction in early adolescents","Vonk, Roosmarijn","['Bos, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction. Adolescence represents a period of high risk for the development anxiety problems and disorders. This is due to an impaired extinction of fear. Adolescents seem to show a less successful fear extinction, but unclear remains if sex and puberty are of influence. Additionally, it remains unclear whether gifted or typical developing adolescents are more vulnerable to an impaired fear extinction. Therefore, this study examines the question “Do sex and puberty affect fear extinction learning in gifted versus typically developing early-adolescents?”. Method. The role of sex, puberty and being a gifted or typical developing adolescent on the fundamental process of fear extinction were measured with the ‘Fear Conditioning Task: The Screaming Lady’ and the Self-Rating Scale for Pubertal Development (N = 130). The obtained data was analyzed by looking at several main- and interaction-effects with a Repeated Mixed Measures ANOVA. Results. Girls seem to better learn fear than boys. Prepubertal adolescents seem to be better at extinguishing fear than pubertal participants. Gifted and typical developing adolescents showed an equal process of fear extinction. Prepubertal adolescents that follow regular education seem to better learn fear than pubertal and/or gifted adolescents. Discussion. Findings in this study contradict with findings in literature. Only the given that prepubertal adolescents seem to be better at extinguishing fear than pubertal participants can be confirmed. Further research on the complex interactions of this study should be done to make conclusions on processes of fear extinction in adolescents.","['fear', 'anxiety', 'extinction', 'adolescents', 'puberty', 'giftedness']"

Smartphone-Based Keystroke Dynamics Predict Cognitive Status in Multiple Sclerosis,"Pieperhoff, Leonard","['Meijer, K.', 'Hulst, H.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder presenting with a variety of symptoms. Next to motor deficits, cognitive deficits such as memory impairment and decreased information processing speed occur in approximately 50% of people with MS (PwMS). Cognitive deficits are often missed by the clinicians, however, and not routinely assessed. Keystroke dynamics (KD), a digital metric based on users’ typing behaviours, differ between PwMS and healthy controls, and could potentially be a valuable monitoring tool for cognitive impairment in MS. Objectives: To assess whether smartphone-based KD are able to differentiate between cognitive status (Impaired/Preserved) in PwMS and predict cognitive functioning. Methods: A total of 95 PwMS with an average age of 46 years (SD = 9.9) and of which 74% were female, participated in the observational cohort study. They had a median disease duration of 5.7 years (IQR = 3.0 - 13.1) with a median EDSS score of 3.5 (IQR = 2.5 - 4.0). Cognition was measured using the BICAMS, and the NeuroKeys application was used for 18 consecutive days to measure KD features. Fifteen KD features were included based on correlations to cognitive measures. PwMS were classified as cognitively impaired (CI) or cognitively preserved (CP) via 1.5 SD cut-off scores based on normative BICAMS data. Independent-samples t-tests were used to investigate differences between CP and CI; logistic regression was used to predict cognitive status. A p-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Compared to CP (N = 65), CI (N = 30) had slower typing speed e.g. as measured by flight time between keystrokes (t(37.49) = -3.76, p < .001, d = 1.01) as well as slowed correction times e.g. a longer post-correction slowing (t(40.53) = -3.63, p < .001, d = 0.92). They also made longer pauses between sentences (U = 605, p < .01, r = 0.26). Cognitive functioning could be predicted by post-correction slowing, the frequency of long pauses and the educational level of PwMS (AUC = .78) with acceptable to excellent accuracy. Conclusion: CI PwMS exhibit distinctly different typing behaviour than CP, and a combination of KD features and educational level can accurately predict cognitive status. Consequently, KD could potentially be a valuable tool for identifying cognitive impairment in MS.","['Multiple Sclerosis', 'Cognitive Impairment', 'Keystroke Dynamics']"
The effect of a cognitive behavioral intervention on the eye gaze behavior of socially anxious adolescents: Do cognitions play a mediating role?,"Kros, Sarah","['van den Bos, E.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The cognitive models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) reason that SAD is caused and maintained by self-focused attention and safety behaviors. The avoidance of eye contact is viewed as a safety-seeking behavior employed to reduce the risk of negative evaluation and is reported by both adults and children with SAD. In the light of growing evidence for the cognitive models of SAD, it seems likely that changing socially anxious individuals’ negative beliefs about themselves, and their performance could lead to more eye gaze behavior, which in turn could break the vicious cycle maintaining SAD. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of a cognitive behavioral intervention on the the relation between socially anxious adolescents’ cognitions and their eye gaze behavior. Cognitions were assessed by a questionnaire and eye gaze behavior was assessed using a wearable eye tracker during a public speaking task. The participants’ total fixation time, total fixation counts and average fixation time on the faces of nine virtual audience members were measured. As expected, the results showed a significant increase in positive cognitions and a significant decrease in negative cognitions from pre-test to post-test. The group as a whole did not show a significant increase in eye gaze behavior, however participants who showed more substantial improvements in terms of positive self-statements on average fixated longer on the audience members’ faces. These findings offer support for the cognitive models of SAD and suggest that promoting more positive self-statements in socially anxious adolescents would be clinically beneficial.","['Social anxiety', 'Gaze behavior', 'Safety behaviors', 'Avoidance', 'Public speaking', 'Eye contact']"
CBM-Maze taak in het leesonderwijs,"Moussa, Amira",['Jochanan Veerbeek'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"The Curriculum Based Measurement is a tracking system from the United States that can track student progress, allowing teachers to evaluate the effects of their instruction on this progress. The Maze task is part of CBM that can map the progress of students in reading. The CBM tracking system is not yet in use in the Netherlands, which is why it is important that research is carried out within Dutch education. It is therefore important that the scores of the CBM measurements are reliable and valid. The current study contributes to a large number of studies on the reliability and validity of the CBM-Maze scores. The aim of this study is to investigate to what extent the CBM-Maze can reflect children's reading comprehension at text level. The children in this study are examined using two digital Maze formats. These two Maze sizes are; the Standard-Maze and the Scrambled-Maze. The difference between boys and girls on the Standard-Maze scores is also examined. For this purpose, 68 pupils between 10 and 12 years old (M = 10.6, SD = 0.57) from group 7 of regular education participated in this study. The results of the study show that the Standard-Maze scores are higher than the Scrambled-Maze scores, meaning that text-level reading comprehension is an important element in completing a CBM-Maze task. In line with expectations, it also emerged that the Standard format of the Maze task can map both reading comprehension and technical reading. In addition, the results showed that gender has no effect on the Standard-Maze scores. The limitations and implications of the research are also discussed. Before the Maze task can be used as an indicator for reading comprehension in Dutch education, a follow-up study with a larger sample is urgently needed.","['Curriculum Based Measurement (CBM), CBM-Maze, reading comprehension, Cito- begrijpend lezen, Cito-technisch lezen, sex, grade 7, Dutch primary education.']"
