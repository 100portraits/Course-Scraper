The Changing Perception and Presentation of China: Viewed through Displays of Porcelain in Dutch Interiors and Museums,"Kokke, Michelle","['Lin, F.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines displays of Chinese porcelain in Dutch museums and how they construct an image of China. Chinese commodities, especially porcelain, ended up in the Netherlands due to increasing trade relations between Europe and China during the seventeenth century. Chinese porcelain was collected and put on display in Dutch interiors. This was mainly done to express the identity of the collector, thus reframing Chinese porcelain in a Dutch context. These porcelain collections eventually ended up in museum displays that framed Chinese porcelain within Western-centered and Orientalist frameworks. From the twenty-first century onwards, museum professionals have attempted to move beyond this Orientalist framework. This thesis aims to evaluate the narratives about Chinese porcelain and China that are being presented by twenty-first century displays of Chinese porcelain in Dutch museums. The analysis is performed through the observation of contemporary museum displays and focusses on the concept of framing. Attention is paid to aspects such as visual design, layout, and textual framing through object labels and wall panels. The analysis is used to evaluate the extent to which Dutch museums present Chinese porcelain as part of Western-centered and Orientalist narratives. The outcomes show that many museums still present a Western-centered narrative and use Orientalist modes of display which highlight the otherness of Chinese porcelain.","['Display, Representation, Porcelain, China, Dutch Museums']"

“Āfӯsed on forðweġe”: How the Dreamer in The Dream of the Rood is Transformed and Becomes an Inspiration for the Reader,"Mout, Anna van der","['Porck, M.H.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Gold, jewels and a cross that is able to speak: these elements are nowhere to be found in the Biblical story about the crucifixion of Christ, but they do appear in the Old English poem The Dream of the Rood. This poem is a retelling of the Biblical story of Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection and there are three characters in this poem: the Dreamer, the Cross and Christ. These characters are linked, because they all experience one or multiple physical or mental transformations. The poet intended for these transformations to be an inspiration for the reader of the poem. Especially the transformation of the Dreamer is supposed to be inspirational, because the Dreamer is the most relatable character for the reader through the focus on their human nature. The question that is discussed in this thesis is: what does the transformation of the Dreamer look like and why can it be inspirational for the reader? The suggested answer to this question is that the poet of The Dream of the Rood used the character of the Dreamer to illustrate the life-changing effect that knowledge of the Bible and following the example of Christ can have on a human being. The reader of the poem is encouraged to follow in the footsteps of the Dreamer, the first step being reading The Dream of the Rood.","['Old English', 'Philology', 'The Dream of the Rood', 'Transformation', 'Old and new self', 'Bible', 'Christ', 'Medieval', 'Ruthwell Cross', 'Brussels Cross', 'Human and divine nature of Christ', 'Vercelli Book']"
The use of Latin-Greek terminology and Popularization Strategies in English PILs and Their Dutch Translations,"Riley, Loïs","['Valdez, S.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The patient information leaflet contains a lot of Latin-Greek medical terminology which laypeople often do not understand. Many studies have been performed that focus on how Latin-Greek medical terminology is translated into different languages, looking at different language pairs. However, little research has been done on the translation of Latin-Greek terminology in English-Dutch patient information leaflets. In order to fill this gap, this thesis analyzes the use of Latin-Greek terminology in the English PILs and the popularization strategies that were used to translate the terms for Dutch laypeople. This study poses two questions. Firstly, whether more Latin-Greek terms are used in the English PILs, as many English lay terms are Latin or Greek-based terms. Secondly, whether there is a significant difference in the number of occurrences of popularization strategies containing Latin-Greek terminology, lay terminology and explication in the English and Dutch PIL sections. The results show that more Latin-Greek terms that are used in the English PILs are indeed Latin or Greek-based terms. The second question, however, could not be answered, as the results of the analysis showed similar number of occurrences of popularization strategies. Further and more extensive research has to be done on the use of Latin-Greek terms and popularization strategies in PILs in order for the second research question posed in this study to be answered.","['Medical translation', 'Latin-Greek terminology', 'patient information leaflets']"

By implementing Roland Barthes’ theory of the linguistic, denoted, and connoted message in the examination of images and how they are framed it becomes clear that even though both news outlets worry about the future of Afghan women, Time magazine continues to justify the US occupation and blames the Taliban for the current situation whereas Al Jazeera takes a more critical stance. Therewith, framing how the current chaos in Afghanistan and the uncertain future of Afghan women is the direct result of the occupation. The frames that constrained the reading of the connoted message of the images are that of the protection scenario, Orientalism, the clash of civilizations, and the white man’s burden which exist within the overarching themes of the unveiling of Afghan women and their access to the public sphere.","['Roland Barthes, connoted message, media framing analysis, constructed realities, Afghan women, US occupation of Afghanistan.']"

Via means of Ubisoft’s action-adventure videogame Assassin’s Creed II (2009) this thesis aims to determine the extent in which the player is free and able to experience freedom in both Assassin’s Creed II individually, as well as compared to three videogames to provide a contextualised framework specifically for Assassin’s Creed II as is used in the methodological framework of this thesis. The three compared videogames being Minecraft (2011), The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011), and Halo Wars (2009) have worked towards providing a contextualised answer in discussed modes of freedom as depicted and present in Assassin’s Creed II. Via both surface layer narrative and underlying structural algorithmic build of videogames, Assassin’s Creed II has been analysed using a philosophical approach via theories and debates on freedom, as well as via the use of algorithmic models and the potential dangers algorithms pose in regards to the player-experience of freedom in videogames. Ultimately, this thesis uncovered the potential dangers of algorithms within Assassin’s Creed II, and thereupon via the compared videogames the potential controlling-tendencies of the use of algorithms in the digital environment.","['Freedom', 'Determinism', 'Ludology', 'Video-Games', 'Assassin’s Creed II.']"
Soul Searching: Moral Psychology and Psychological Morality in Second-Century AD Middle Platonism,"Rheenen, Wendi van","['Berg, R.M. van den']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"What does it mean to be a good person? How should one behave? What is our soul like? How is it structured? And how does our soul affect our behaviour? These are questions that have occupied us since the dawn of time. This thesis explores the ways in which Middle Platonist thinkers of the second century AD in particular approach such questions of good moral behaviour. As it turns out, these thinkers tend to focus on the human soul and its constitution in order to tackle moral conundrums. Therefore, the research question this thesis aims to answer is as follows: how do the Middle Platonists of the second century AD use the structure of the human soul in order to enforce practical ethics? By examining the works of Maximus of Tyre, Alcinous, and Galen – authors active in different genres within the Middle Platonic philosophical movement – through the lenses of both ancient psychology as well as ancient moral psychology, this thesis aims to advocate for the presence of a methodology of psychological morality in Middle Platonism: the structure of the human soul is noticeably being used in order to enforce ideal behaviour.","['ancient philosophy', 'Middle Platonism', 'moral psychology', 'ancient psychology', 'ethics', 'Maximus of Tyre', 'Alcinous', 'Galen']"

Of Black Ships and Catfish: The West in Japanese Auspicious Motifs After the Arrival of Perry,"Ortmann, Adrian Alexander","['Müller, D.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Japanese woodblock prints' dual nature as both an artistic product and an information tool offers ample opportunity for anthropological research. The spread of pieces and motifs offers insight into what topics may have been of interest to common folk and, to a lesser extent, may be used to get an impression of the common perception of political events. The arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry in 1853, which ushered in the end of Japan's national seclusion policies, is commonly said to have been the source of much uncertainty and upheaval within Japan. Though this proved akin to a cataclysm for Japan's existing governing structures, it appears shortsighted to assume that anxiety towards the future was the only reaction this event had caused. A print which featured a whale with catfish-like features swimming in the Bay of Edo, released after the arrival of Perry and the earthquake, appears to directly comment on this contact with the West, and its tone spells hopes for an economic boon more so than fears. This brought about questions about the possibility of a positive attitude towards the opening of Japan, perhaps from within commoner demographics who stood to gain from the period of rapid change this event promised, and presented the catfish as a stand-in for American gunboats. Therefore, this paper seeks to discuss in what ways the folklore motifs were present in the black boat prints and Perry portraits and how they reflected attitudes towards foreign powers in Japan.","['Namazu', 'Catfish', 'Perry', 'Sakoku', 'Nishiki-e', 'Yokohama-e', 'Foreigners in Japan', 'Tengu', 'Kirishitan']"

Inscribed Into Skin: The Influence of Trauma on Narration in Spellslinger and Way of the Argosi,"Termeer, Anouschka","['Cameron-Gardos, P.S.S.N.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Young adults are continually confronted with instability and crises, as well as traumatic events at large. Considering that literature, and Young Adult literature specifically, can be seen as a reflection of the lived experience, it is expected that the existence of such trauma influences the novels written. The ability of Young Adult literature to reflect the lived experience, and the necessity for it to do so, is also discussed by columnist and author Michael Cart in 2016, literature researcher Bruce Carrick in 2017 and literature studies researcher Amy Elliot in 2015. However, they do not specifically note on the place of trauma in this reflection. This thesis considers how trauma affects the narrator’s voice. To do so, Canadian author Sebastien de Castell’s fantasy Young Adult novels Way of the Argosi and Spellslinger were taken as a case study. Ferius and Kellen, the respective protagonists of the aforementioned novels, are confronted with traumatic experiences, such as torture and genocide. Due to perceived commonalities in the situations of the protagonists, and their communities, to that of Indigenous communities, knowledge of the latter is used to make sense of the former. Similarly, knowledge of the Holocaust was used to contemplate the fictional narrative. Knowledge on trauma in these real world communities was gained from articles by, among others, psychologists Sarah Panofsky et al. (2021) and social worker Elizabeth Fast and psychologist Delphine Collin-Vézina (2010). Due to the influence trauma can have on the lived experience, there was a need for discussing the reliability of the narrator of each novel. As a result, this thesis looked to the articles on unreliable and fallible narrators by religious studies professor Catherine Caufield, published in 2021, and cultural studies researcher Greta Olson, published in 2003. A close reading of the novels found trauma to affect not only the narratorial style, such as through narrative fragmentation, but also the narrator’s reliability and tone of voice. Though the narrators of Way of the Argosi and Spellslinger were not affected similarly in narratorial style, with the former’s narration being more fragmented as opposed to the linear narration of the latter, the tone of voice is comparable. In both cases, there is a clear influence of fear and resentment on the narrator’s voice. The reliability of the respective novels narrators is also similarly fallible, though due to different reasons. The insight provided by the novels to the readers allow for a fostering of understanding between different real-life cultures, histories and life-journeys.","['Trauma', 'YA literature', 'narration', 'fallible narrator', 'resilience models', 'Sebastien de Castell', 'Way of the Argosi', 'Spellslinger']"

This thesis highlights the importance of language within totalitarian regimes. Linguistic totalitarian language features were defined and analysed. The linguistic totalitarian features used in this research were compiled based on previously conducted research. The analysed features included loaded language, compound nouns, euphemisms, neologisms, abbreviations, acronyms, and slogans. The novels were read and afterwards analysed through corpus and discourse analysis. The software AntConc was used for the corpus analysis. The instances of totalitarian language use within the novels were highlighted and processed into tables. The novels possessed unique tables and each table reflected one analysed feature. The results were compared and revealed that the novels indeed incorporated totalitarian language features within their texts. The novel 1984 made use of all the seven analysed features. Brave New World made use of six analysed features, leaving out the linguistic feature concerning abbreviations. In addition, the research concluded that the two novels are linguistically comparable as they included frequent instances of the analysed features. However, the novel 1984 included moderately more instances of totalitarian language use.","['Totalitarianism, Totalitarian Language, 1984, Brave New World, Linguistics, Discourse analysis, Corpus Analysis']"

The study delves into the historical context of land ownership, the formulation and implementation of land reform programs, and the challenges faced in achieving equitable land distribution. The thesis explores the historical evolution of land ownership, the emergence of land reform legislation, and the implementation of land redistribution policies. It reveals that post-apartheid land reform policies have inadvertently revived colonial perceptions of land use, reintroduced the historical role of chiefs, and resulted in constitutional discrepancies. The dominance of colonial agricultural structures within the land reform program has hindered its objectives and posed significant challenges. The resurgence of chiefs has also emerged as a substantial obstacle, particularly for women, in enhancing rural livelihoods. These consequences have contributed to adverse effects on women and rural communities, perpetuating inequalities and marginalizing vulnerable groups.","['Land Reform Policies', 'South Africa', 'Apartheid', 'Women', 'Rural Livelihoods']"

This deterministic way of interpreting the relationship between the Middle Eastern environment and its inhabitants has been subject to critique from a growing body of literature on political ecology. Although some political ecology research has challenged environmental deterministic assumptions by exploring the role of natural resources in environmental challenges in the Gulf, previous works have not yet provided a comprehensive analysis of various environmental dimensions in a single case study context. This thesis aims to fill this gap in the literature by asking: What is the role of natural resources in engaging with environmental challenges in relation to water, food, and energy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)? This thesis examines the political-ecological metabolisms of three strategies employed to address environmental challenges in relation to water, energy, and food in the UAE: desalination, solar energy, and land grabs.

The research delves into how the political discourse of the largest and most influential right-wing to far-right political parties in France and Hungary affected and shaped public opinion, social hostility, and Islamophobia between the first considerable influx of immigrants in 2015 and the first nationwide elections held after the crisis, in 2017 in France and 2018 in Hungary. By comparing similar social and political phenomena in the two countries, the current thesis also scrutinizes crucial differences between France and Hungary’s respective historical, political, social, and demographic contexts to reveal why certain political and rhetorical strategies proved successful in one country and not in the other.",

“Atomic Wonderland?” The Significance of American Nuclear Diplomacy and Cold War Culture on the Making of a Japanese Nuclear Powerhouse- A Constructivist View of the Atom as a White Hope in Postwar Japan,"Staudt, Eileen","['Yang, Shiming']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"“How did American Nuclear Diplomacy and Cold War Culture Facilitate the Making of a Japanese Nuclear Powerhouse in Postwar Japan?” This thesis examines the introductory phase of nuclear power to Japan from 1945 to 1960 with a focus on political and cultural enabling factors towards the country`s decision to “go nuclear”. The central argument of this thesis constitutes that understanding nuclear developments in Japan requires acknowledging American nuclear diplomacy efforts, Cold War dynamics and strong cultural beliefs in Science and Technology developments at that time, mainstream economic or ecological reasoning is insufficient. This thesis concludes that Japanese nuclear developments were fueled by American nuclear diplomacy efforts, an existing Cold War culture and ideological beliefs in the superiority of pioneering science and technology developments in the postwar era, which made the Japanese government and society euphoric for nuclear power, enthusiastic for nuclear adoptions. This paper enhanced understanding of the introductory phase of nuclear power from a global to a national level, exemplified and explained through Japan as an Asian regional case study deconstructed via a historically situated political and cultural contextualization.","['Science and Technology', 'US-Japan Relations', 'Atomic Energy', 'Cold War', 'Atomic Age', 'Constructivism']"

Kashmir Smast is a religious cave and settlement site in the Mardan District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This site is currently dated from at least the 2nd century CE and may be one of the earliest dated sites associated with Hinduism in Pakistan, with occupation continuing until at least the 11th century. Researchers have identified Kashmir Smast as the earliest Śaivite site in the northwest based on material culture including a wide range of religious motifs found on unique seals (Nasim Khan, 2003). However, there is also evidence of Vaiṣṇava, Buddhist, Zoroastrian, and Islamic connections through the archaeological and textual evidence associated with the site. Based on a range of material connected to Kashmir Smast the principal deity is believed to be the goddess Bhīmā, associated with fortune and prosperity. To date very few studies have explored Bhīmā in detail with most studies offering her a cursory mention within the iconography found on the seals and coinage. This thesis takes this opportunity to contribute a new perspective to the understanding of this site and develop wider research around this goddess, through exploring an interdisciplinary approach to analysing religious change.","['Pakistan', 'Archaeology', 'Hinduism', 'Gandhara', 'Goddesses']"
Realities of postwar education: Japanese teachers’ views on the state of education during the American Occupation,"Olthof, Alie","['Mark, Ethan']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I aim to answer the question “how did Japanese teachers themselves view the state of postwar education during the American Occupation?”. In chapter 1, a brief overview will be given of the state of education and the educational reforms during the American Occupation. In chapter 2, the scholarly debate on the issues surrounding Japanese education in the Occupation period (1945-1952) will be described and analysed, as well as the scholarly debate on the views of the Japanese people on defeat and war responsibility in the direct postwar period. In chapter 3, three examples of the realities faced by teachers in Japan during the American Occupation are explored on the basis of two published diaries and one published memoir:“ How did teachers deal with defeat? Days of anguish and fumbling around - Two-year education diary (Kyōshi wa haisen dō mukaeta no ka: Kunō to mosaku no hibi― 2-Nenkan no kyōiku nisshi)” by Nagai Kenji and “War and love: a female teacher’s war and postwar diary (Ikusa to ai to: Josei kyōshi no senchū sengo nikki)” by Kobayashi Hana and Reminiscences of an Elementary School Principal (Aru shōgakkō-chō no kaisō) by Kanazawa Kaichi. The experiences of these teachers will be analysed in the broader context of the postwar education in order to get a better understanding of the “bottom-up” processes they participated in. I argue that viewing postwar education from a “bottom-up” perspective brings to light new insights on the educational reforms and their implementation, and the on experiences of teachers as under the American Occupation","['Japan, Education, American Occupation']"

The neural architecture underlying syntactic word-meaning integration: A literature review of fMRI studies,"Vis, Lennart","['Pablos Robles, L.', 'Witteman, J.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This literature review investigates the neural architectures more strongly involved in sentence processing compared to the processing of unstructured word-lists, focusing on syntactic word-meaning integration. The inferior frontal gyrus, anterior temporal cortex, and posterior temporal cortex emerged as prominent regions associated with sentence processing. Additional regions, such as the angular gyrus and selective right hemispheric architecture, also exhibited enhanced activation during sentence processing. These findings support the concept of a distributed network of syntactically functional neural architecture. The results align with Hagoort's Memory, Unification, and Control model, suggesting that different components of neural architecture correlate with the model's functionality. However, persisting debates regarding the precise involvement of the IFG and its subdivisions as well as other featured regions in sentence processing warrant further investigation. Overall, this review emphasises the diffuse nature of the neural architecture underlying syntactic word-meaning integration, calling for further exploratory and explanatory investigations.","['sentence processing, word-lists, syntactic word-meaning integration, neural architecture, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior temporal cortex, posterior temporal cortex, angular gyrus, distributed network, MUC model']"

On Quantum Realism: Tracing the Physicalist Thesis in Quantum IR,"Molina Obedman, Yuval","['Smith, K.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In recent years, especially since Alexander Wendt’s 2015 'Quantum mind and social science,' a timid yet promising body of literature, building from a range of post-structuralist and new materialist theory, has sought out to disentangle the ubiquity of the “Newtonian imagery” (Murphy, 2019) and its effects in social theorizing in IR. However, sustained attention to 'Quantum Mind' has led many to associate this bourgeoning field with Wendt’s own philosophical claims, despite a great number of rich and varied contributions. Despite Wendt’s attempts to the contrary, his adoption of “quantum realism” (Murphy, 2021) poses substantial risks to the kind of anti-positivism quantum social science claims to spearhead. In this thesis, I explore the reasons why Wendt’s take on human subjectivity entails a transcendentalist position unwarranted by his attempt at a ‘flat’ ontology. As I argue, his reliance on analytical philosophy of mind leads him to effectively adopt a physicalist position which he now rebrands as naturalism. This inherent contradiction allows to trace Wendt’s metaphysical allegiances to the unsuspected legacy of logical empiricism in their insistence on the language of physicalism and the Unity of Science thesis.","['quantum IR', 'physicalism', 'quantum realism', 'ontology', 'unity of science', 'philosophy of social science', 'Newtonian IR']"

How Clear is the PIL to my Pill? An Investigation Into Explicitation and Implicitation in the Translation of PILs,"Gaans, Annemeike van","['Valdez, S.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Ever since the introduction of Translation Universals, their existence has been widely debated. Explicitation and implicitation are no exception to this. These Translation Universals, both separately and together, have been studied in a variety of genres and text types. This thesis examined explicitation and implicitation in Dutch Patient Information Leaflets (PILs). It looked at how explicit the Dutch PILs were, what the rate of explicitation to implicitation was, and which explicitation and implicitation strategies were used. To study this, a bilingual parallel corpus of English and Dutch PILs of orally taken contraceptives was analysed. The source and target texts were compared side by side and occurrences of explicitation and implicitation were identified, the rate of explicitation to implicitation was calculated and the different implicitation strategies used were determined. The results show a rate of 60% explicitation and 40% implicitation, with 234 explicitation shifts and 156 implicitation shifts identified. Additionally, a wide range of explicitation and implicitation strategies was found, with the most common explicitation strategies being the addition of a connective element, the filling of an elliptical structure and the use of lexical repetition. The most commonly used implicitation strategy, by far, was the use of a hypernym. Overall, Dutch PILs were more explicit than English ones, especially concerning connectives, though English PILs were more explicit in regard to hyponyms. With this research into explicitation and implicitation, we are one step closer to either confirming or disputing these Translation Universals, using the method proposed by Chesterman (2010). Additionally, by researching the explicitness of PILs, we contribute to the existing research on their lay-friendliness.","['Explicitation', 'implicitation', 'explicitation strategies', 'implicitation strategies', 'patient information leaflets', 'package leaflets', 'PILs', 'corpus study']"
Parasocial Relationships and Sasaeng Fans: A Case Study of Obsessive Fans,"Knibbeler, Merel","['Green, C.K.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Koreastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores the relations between parasocial relationships and sasaeng behaviour in the Korean entertainment industry. As K-pop has become more popular than ever through the Korean Wave, companies have started to introduce more and more ways for fans to create strong attachments to idols through the form of parasocial relationships. However, because of these strong parasocial relationships, some fans have started to show obsessive behaviour towards idols. These so-called sasaeng fans will engage in all kinds of socially unacceptable behaviour to get close to their idol. Through three separate case studies, this thesis illustrates a connection between parasocial relationships and sasaeng fans. All the sasaeng fans that have been observed have some kind of parasocial relationship with the person of their affection. It can therefore be concluded that while not every fan will fall into sasaeng behaviour because they show a parasocial connection to the idol, a sasaeng fan will usually have formed a parasocial bond with someone prior to showcasing sasaeng behaviour. Thus, there is a correlation between sasaeng fans and parasocial relationships.","['parasocial relationships', 'Korean idols', 'sasaeng fans', 'K-pop', 'fandom studies']"
Individual Differences in Musical Experience and L2 Vowel Perception: Insights from EEG and Behavioral Measures,"Vos, Renate","['Witteman, J.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"There are large individual differences among late second language learners. The present study investigated whether individual differences in late L2 acquisition could be explained by individual differences in musical experience, because a large number of prior studies showed that musicians have enhanced auditory processing abilities. Dutch late-learners of English performed an AXB identification task, a 4I2AFC discrimination task and a passive oddball task with the English vowel contrast DRESS-TRAP. Data was analyzed with a multilevel single-trial approach to focus on the explanation of individual differences. The results showed large individual differences in all three tasks, good behavioral discrimination of the vowel contrast, and a large mismatch negativity (MMN) effect. A relation between discrimination performance and the variables musical experience and MMN amplitude was found, indicating that better behavioral discrimination of small acoustic differences was related to more musical experience and larger MMN differences. The absence of a similar relation with identification performance was attributed to a ceiling effect and restricted range of results on this task. The fact that no significant relation was found between musical experience and MMN amplitude, was explained by the required discrimination difficulty to measure a positive effect of musical experience, which was not met by the stimuli in the oddball task.","['MMN', 'identification', 'discrimination', 'musical experience', 'multilevel models']"

Copy or Original Creation? Unravelling the Enigma of a Series of Seventeenth-Century Old Testament Drawings by an Anonymous Netherlandish Master in the Leiden Special Collections,"Han, Jina","['Bleyerveld, Yvonne']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Album of Drawings (object number: PK-T-AW-xxx) housed in the University of Leiden's Special Collections presents a compelling enigma within art history. Comprising 80 intricately executed pen and brown ink drawings embellished with grey wash, these depictions meticulously portray episodes from the Old Testament. The illustration spans Genesis through Judges, highlighting the relationship between God and His people and the latter’s struggles, faith and challenges as they define their identity and purpose, guided by divine intervention and historical context. Measuring around 4.2 × 5.6 cm, each drawing showcases remarkable detail and skill. The elusive identity of the artist adds an intriguing dimension to the collection. This research aims to uncover the album's history, the artist's pictorial references, the drawings' purpose, their likely creation date, and their status as copies or original works. Employing an object-oriented methodology, the study combines visual and iconographical analyses with examination of relevant literature and technical resources, including watermark and transfer techniques. The album consists of two sections: eight drawings of fruits and nuts, believed to be created by the album's owner, and 80 Old Testament drawings attributed to an anonymous Netherlandish artist, potentially originating after 1659. Visual scrutiny suggests that most drawings are adaptations of widely disseminated contemporary prints, drawing inspiration from prominent artists like Antonio Tempesta, Jost Amman, and Pieter Hendricksz. Schut. These drawings display thematic and compositional correlations with identified sources, hinting at the artist's access to a diverse array of visual materials. The sequential arrangement of scenes echoes a picture Bible, possibly intended for broader distribution through printing. The inquiry into whether these biblical drawings are copies or original creations is pivotal. Despite drawing from existing compositions—a prevalent practice—evidence suggests deliberate alterations, infusing them with a distinct style, emotional depth, and focus on human actions. These modifications, coupled with the amalgamation of diverse sources, elevate the drawings beyond mere reproductions. The artist's conscientious choices underscore the intricate interplay between artistic value and intended purpose. In conclusion, this research provides an in-depth exploration of the Album of Drawings, shedding light on its historical context, artistic origins, and potential functions. Through meticulous analysis, the study enhances our understanding of Netherlandish biblical illustration in the seventeenth century and fosters a deeper appreciation for these captivating pen drawings.","['Old Testament', 'drawing', '17th century', 'Leiden Special Collection', 'anonymous master', 'biblical prints', 'picture bible', 'Antonio Tempesta', 'Jost Amman', 'Pieter Hendricksz.

Acoustic correlates and diagnostics of ATR in Boa-Leboale,"Ahmed, Samuel","['de Wit, G.', 'Botma, E.D.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates a recurring issue found in fieldwork on Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan languages: how can a linguist tell if a given language has the vowels [ɪ ʊ], or [e o], or both? These two pairs of vowels – which differ in their height and ATR (‘advanced tongue root’) value – are notoriously difficult to tell apart acoustically, and their pronunciation varies considerably between languages and even speakers. Moreover, previous studies have only focused on how to distinguish these vowels in languages with both pairs; in languages with just one pair, how do we know if that pair is [ɪ ʊ] or [e o]? To address this gap, the main acoustic study of this thesis looks at data from Boa-Leboale, a Bantu language spoken in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that has historically been described as only having [ɪ ʊ], not [e o]. Using the results and acoustic methodology of Starwalt’s (2008) landmark study, I construct a number of hypotheses to test two research questions; research question (I) investigates whether Boa-Leboale has one or two pairs of vowels and research question (II) attempts to identify whether a given set of vowels is more likely to be [ɪ ʊ] or [e o]. The results of this study indicate that Boa-Leboale does indeed have only one pair of vowels, and those vowels are most likely [ɪ ʊ], as suggested by previous descriptions. Given this promising result, I hope that further studies will be able to improve on the study presented here and solve the issue of identifying these vowels acoustically not just for Boa-Leboale, but for any language.","['phonetics', 'acoustics', 'bantu']"

This is the thesis I will put forth over the course of this investigation, based on a discussion of three major perspectives on the relation between death and meaning. The thesis is centered around the verb revealing, interpreted in three different ways, allowing me to synthesize the different perspectives into one central claim whilst respecting their differences. The claim that death reveals the meaning of existence comes down to the attempt to think the paradox of death. As such, my main objective is to show that death must be thought in its ambiguity. Death’s ambiguity will turn out to be the common ground underlying all perspectives I will discuss; it is the space where death is revealed in its relation to the meaning of existence. As such, the claim that death reveals the meaning of existence will itself prove to be an equivocal statement.","['Death', 'Finitude', 'Meaning', 'Significance', 'Revelation', 'Being-towards-death', 'Event', ""The Other's death"", 'Wholly other', 'the beyond', 'Il y a', 'Heidegger', 'Romano', 'Levinas', 'Derrida', 'Blanchot']"

The study expands upon existing literature by integrating feedback effects into the framework, alongside normative, domestic political, and geopolitical factors, as well as diffusion effects. The findings underscore the significant influence of normative and geopolitical considerations, while also highlighting the constraints imposed by humanitarian and economic concerns. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a dynamic sanctions regime shaped by feedback mechanisms and evolving geopolitical dynamics.

A comparative analysis on the evolution of framing in Dutch media with regards to Albania’s European Union (EU) enlargement process.,"Gruda, Flamur","['Dr. Maxine David', 'Dr. Marije Cornelissen']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to explore the evolution of Dutch media framing concerning Albania's European Union (EU) integration process. To better understand the complex dynamics impacting perceptions of Albania's EU integration, examining the media mood, framing tendencies, and the general thematic focus in Dutch news coverage is imperative. This will be guided by the theoretical framework of Liberal Intergovernmentalism Theory (LIT). The research focuses on one central question: How does the media framing of Albania in Dutch media correlate with the Dutch government's decision-making on Albania's accession process between 2018 and 2022? The findings highlight how the media can influence public opinion and policy dialogue through links between media framing and Albania's integration milestones. The findings indicate that there is a strong correlation between the portrayal of Albania in the Dutch media and the decision- making of the Dutch government on Albania's accession to the EU. The fluctuating emphasis of media framing, which reflects external influences and geopolitical dynamics, is consistent with the fundamental ideas of LIT, which hold that domestic actors must adjust to global conditions. This study emphasizes the connections among media narratives, public opinion, and policy concerns. It stresses the significance of acknowledging the media's role in promoting an informed and positive public debate on EU integration.","['Albania', 'European Union', 'Enlargement', 'Framing', 'Media', 'Netherlands']"

These expectations were largely grounded in Khatami’s rhetoric of social justice and the promises of more socio-political and cultural freedoms that he voiced during his electoral campaign. In practice, however, these promises did not materialise and disappointed workers and students alike. Khatami continued the economic neoliberalisation that his predecessor Rafsanjani (r. 1989-1997) had begun and the supreme leader, Khamenei (r. 1989-), heavily resisted his attempts to create more relaxed academic settings. Although the existing literature explains why Khatami and Khamenei, which respectively represented the reformist and conservative sides of the political spectrum, embraced different labour policy-paths, it does not seek to understand how both officials constructed their social reality such that it made sense for them to do so. Presuming that the meaning of political factions is objectively defined, the literature therefore foregoes enquiring after the discursive context in which they constructed their ideologies and how these related to their policy-paths. However, as policies do not originate in an intellectual and institutional vacuum but are made possible in a political context where competing discourses interact, examining them from a discursive perspective clarifies how rather than why these officials perceived them as meaningful paths to pursue. This focus on ideology construction then leads to enquiring how both constructed Iran’s identity and, by implication, that of workers and students. Taking a poststructuralist approach, this thesis therefore enquires how Khatami’s and Khamenei’s evolving discursive negotiation on Iranian identity was co-constitutionally related to the approved labour policies that concerned workers and students during Khatami’s presidency (r. 1997-2005).","['labour', 'modern Iran', 'Khatami', 'Khamenei', 'national identity']"
An Alternative Neo-Confucianism: Zhang Shi Learning and the Intellectual Transitions Between Northern and Southern Song China,"Fan, Zijian",['Dr. Jiyan Qiao'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Contrary to the stereotype that Zhang Shi 張栻 (1133-1181) always followed Zhu Xi’s 朱熹 (1130-1200) ideas, this thesis, by examining Zhang’s social origins, socio-political thoughts, and disciples, argues that Zhang represents a transitional Neo-Confucianism, which is based on exiled bureaucrat and emphasizes military-fiscal skills and state activism. Zhang Shi learning provides an alternative to statism Wang Anshi 王安石 (1021-1086) learning in the Northern Song (960-1127) and typical Neo-Confucianism represented by Zhu Xi and Lu Jiuxuan 陸九淵 (1139-1191) in Southern Song (1127-1279) , which is based on local spontaneous elites and emphasizes the role of society and local volunteerism. The social origin and foundation of this transitional Neo-Confucianism was the former (potential) capital bureaucratic family who were exiled due to the fall of the Northern Song. They took the northern expedition to return to the capital as their goal and gave up the run of their hometowns and the local communities in which they lived. They were skeptical of Zhu Xi’s social program, such as the community compacts (xiangyang 鄉約), the community granaries (shecang 社倉) and private commercial publishing, which later became the typical behavior of Neo-Confucian. Based on the ideas of Mencius (Mengzi 孟子), Zhang Shi developed the theory of “spontaneous disinterestedness” (wu suowei er ran 無所為而然), which underpinned his ideas on the distinction between righteousness/public/king and profit/selfish/hegemon. Though Zhang learning relied on the state, it cut sharply with Wang learning in the aspect of “motivation”. For Zhang, the power of the state was not an end in itself, but rather the state should be consistent with the spontaneous disinterestedness from the heavenly principle. With a particular emphasis on military-fiscal skills, Zhang and his disciples sought to take over the state apparatus left behind by Wang Anshi’s reforms and to make this state act out of righteousness in the hands of Neo-Confucianism gentlemen. Zhang and his disciples proposed and participated in all the northern expeditions during the Southern Song period. However, the northern capital could never be returned, and the number of exiled bureaucrats who were the social base of Zhang learning (and of the Huxiang 湖湘 school in general) dwindled over time. Zhu Xi, who came from a family of low-ranking exiled bureaucrats, found a new world in the local community in the south, and endeavored to transform himself into a member of the local elite, stepping out from behind Zhang Shi. After Zhang’s death, the local students he left behind in Hunan 湖南 and Sichuan 四川 were eventually aborted by the emerging typical Neo-Confucianism (Zhu Xi and Lu Jiuyuan school) that spoke for the local elites. Zhang as a kind of transitional Neo-Confucianism eventually faded from history, completing the transition from the Northern Song learning to the later typical Neo-Confucianism. By reframing this transitional and alternative Neo-Confucianism, this thesis refines the Hymes-Bol’s localism paradigm about the explanation of why and how Neo-Confucianism raised.","['Zhang Shi', 'Huxiang school', 'Neo-Confucianism', 'Intellectual Transition', 'Southern Song', 'Spontaneous Disinterestedness', 'Localism']"
Radical Convergence: Tracing the Dynamics of Mutual Radicalization Interactive Model in Britain’s Extremist Spectrum,"Latránová, Suzanne",['Dr. I.G.B.M. Duyvesteyn'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research investigates the radicalization trajectories within the British extremist spectrum, with a specific focus on two groups characterized by their heightened antagonistic ideologies: the British Muslim community and the British far-right groups. The analyzed period spans from 2005 to 2013, a time marked by an upsurge in extremist hate crimes, escalating further until a significant number of British Muslims decided to abandon their lives in the United Kingdom to join the ranks of the Islamic State’s caliphate. Drawing on Moghaddam’s (2018) mutual radicalization model, this research analyzes three stages considered as the cornerstones in the construction of the radicalization model: the group mobilization, heightened cohesion within the respective groups, and the transformative shifts in antagonistic identity. Critical discourse analysis is applied as a method for assessment of the collected evidence, in order to evaluate the model’s efficacy. Ultimately, this study underscores the model’s value in comprehending group actions and processes, particularly in response to trigger events such as hate crimes or acts of terrorism. However, limitations arise when accounting for external variables that transcend the mutual radicalization’s binary framework. By shedding light on the added value as well as the limitations of this model, this study provides valuable insights for future research on group radicalization, while informing the policymakers about the angles to consider when formulating counter-extremist strategies.","['Group radicalization', 'Mutual radicalization', 'Far-right extremism', 'Islamic extremism', 'Britain']"
On Resonance and Relationships: Social Ontology as the Site of Ethico-Political Critique within Post-Foundational Thought,"Krieger, Adrian Hans Albrecht","['Krogh, M.L.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"Post-foundational political thought, based on the recognition of necessary contingency of all political arrangements has been widely employed as both an analytical tool as well as a vehicle for critique in light of several diagnoses of the abysmal future of contemporary democracies. Nonetheless, there is reason to belief that the efficacy of post-foundationalism is compromised through a deficit in the articulation of normative critique, and in the actualisation and operationalisation of critique revealing the contingency of the political, i.e., ethico-political critique. This thesis sets out to fulfil two endeavours: first, identify the possibility of articulating ethico-political critique within a paradigm of post-foundationalism through relational practices in social ontology, and second, apply this paradigm as an analytical tool onto one of the most prominent diagnoses of contemporary democracy’s decline, Wendy Brown’s account of neoliberal de-democratisation. Through this, this thesis argues that the site of ethico-political critique in post-foundationalism may be found in relational resistance practices within the ontic dimension of the social which reveal the contingency of both ontic and ontological arrangements in both the social and the political. Thus, such practices could serve as a first step in articulating a scheme of critique against neoliberal de-democratisation which, according to Brown, currently fails due to the absence of alternative world-views.","['post-foundational political thought', 'democracy', 'democratic theory', 'de-democratisation', 'critique', 'social ontology', 'resonance', 'Brown', 'Rosa']"

Additionally, the strategies of ""reading against the grain"" and ""reading with the grain"" are carried out to highlight the interplay between dominant and alternative discourses. This provides a deeper understanding of the conflicting meanings, ideas, and arguments between Islamic modernists and traditionalists. Despite being excluded from the academic field, this research showed that al-Kawtharī was a very prolific scholar who played a significant role in shaping Islamic thought in Egypt.

This study also articulates how Korean literature’s emergence worldwide has not yet gained the desired recognition due to a series of transnational factors. Consequently, it will reveal the different stances in the discussion surrounding the limits and issues within the Korean literary circle (mundan) and finally, it points out how Korean literature in translation can accomplish both domestic and international prestige and leave its footprint on the global literary market.","['Scale shifting', 'Korean literature', 'mundan', 'literary translation', 'field of outbound literary translation']"
Your man’s literary representation of Dublin: A study of Dialectal features represented in the plays of Dublin Authors,"Nyberg, Ebba","['Gordon, M.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Dialects have been studied in different ways for centuries, from the dialectal maps that pioneered the field to the contemporary analysis between urban speech and rural speech. Through the medium of drama scripts produced by Dublin playwrights, this thesis studies how Dublin speech has shifted in its representation and, by extension, how the variety has shifted. With the aim of giving insight into the accuracy of representation, the sociolinguistic aspects of how language varieties are represented by characters of different backgrounds and how this intersects with the aspect of time. By analyzing nine separate plays written by three authors, across about 80 years, the study concluded that drama encapsulates a high degree of non-standard variety-specific features. These are especially apparent in the use of grammatical features, phrasal constructions, and vocabulary. The incorporation of the Irish language and the use of minor respellings to portray non-standard speech was, however, concluded to be mainly stylistic. Yet, a lot of items corresponding to documented Dublin features were found in the texts. Out of these it was the grammatical items that stood out the most. Several grammatical forms were found across all authors, specific forms that also corresponded to Irish and Dublin features. Lastly, this study could not add much to the sociolinguistic aspects of literary non-standard representation.

Speaking for the 'right' women: radical-right populism and women's representation in the European Parliament,"Giovannoni, Beatrice","['Palacio Ludeña, M.G.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,European Politics and Society: Vaclav Havel Joint Master Programme,Master thesis,en,"This research investigates the convergence between feminism and radical-right populism in the field of women’s representation in the European Union. Although previous research has explored how populist radical- right actors exploit feminist narratives to advance Islamophobic anti-immigration stances, little has been said about how feminist arguments contribute to radical-right populist attempts to represent women substantively. This is relevant because, through the representative process, populist radical-right parties construct specific views of women’s identities, interests, and gender equality that are increasingly becoming part of the European political discourse. As the popularity of radical-right populist parties rises across Europe, so does their ability to use seemingly liberal narratives to leave the political fringes and enter the mainstream. Therefore, analysing the nature and the objectives of a potential convergence between feminism and radical-right populism is crucial to understanding which identities and interests would be advanced, marginalised, or erased if a populist radical- right form of feminism became dominant. This research aims to uncover 1) whether a populist radical-right form of feminism exists and what it may look like; 2) which goals populist radical-right parties pursue when they use feminist arguments to represent women; 3) which women are represented or excluded when populist radical-right parties adopt feminist arguments in their claims. To achieve this, the method of reflexive thematic analysis is applied to a sample of 82 representative claims for women advanced by populist radical-right members of the European Parliament during 26 plenary debates held between 2019 and 2023. This study concludes that populist radical-right feminism contributes to reinforcing an ‘us’ versus ‘them’ narrative, which depicts populist radical-right parties as the true champions of women's interests and ‘real’ gender equality. In doing so, populist radical-right feminism promotes an exclusionary understanding of women’s identities and interests that contradicts the inclusive and intersectional efforts undertaken by the most recent waves of feminist activism. Therefore, future research on the relationship between feminism and radical-right populism may build on the present work to explore how we can challenge the spreading of such an exclusionary narrative and promote a more inclusive and intersectional approach to representation.",

Media Discourse in the European Union on Sustainable Food Systems,"Keenleyside, Vivien","['David, Maxine']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,European Politics and Society: Vaclav Havel Joint Master Programme,Master thesis,en,"The necessity of a transition to a more sustainable food system is widely recognised, but the path that should be taken to achieve this is strongly contested. In 2020 the European Commission published the Farm to Fork Strategy, a policy framework which has the aim of facilitating the transition to a more sustainable food system in the European Union. Since its publication, it has however faced mounting opposition and consequently there are growing concerns that the original promise of the Strategy will be watered down. In light of the need to build and maintain support for the Farm to Fork Strategy throughout the EU, a deeper understanding of the media discourse on this issue can provide important insights for policymakers and campaigners. There is, however, little research on the media discourse on sustainability, and even less on sustainable food systems. Using Austria and Czechia as case studies, this thesis investigates the media discourse on sustainable food systems in the European Union. My findings demonstrate that while there are many similarities in the reporting, there are also important differences in the content of the media coverage between the two countries. Furthermore, I find that frames which emphasise the role of the market in addressing sustainability issues are dominant in the coverage across both countries. Other key frames identified include the role of regulation in transitioning to sustainable food systems, as well as the potential of technological solutions. Furthermore, a new frame is identified that emphasises how the negative impacts of imported food such as food insecurity and carbon emissions can be avoided through prioritisation of nationally produced food.","['sustainable food systems', 'media discourse', 'qualitative analysis', 'framing', 'Austria', 'Czechia']"
Publishing with a Purpose: The Writings of Seventeenth-Century English Authors Katherine Sutton and Mary Hampson at Goddaeus Publishing House in Rotterdam,"Johnson, Maretta","['Polak, S.', 'Rolfe, K.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Browsing through the archives of the Rotterdam Public Library, I discovered that the historic book collection contains a single publication by an English woman at the seventeenth-century Rotterdam publishing house of Goddaeus, that of Katherine Sutton. Asking myself why this was the only book by a woman to be published at Goddaeus’ publishing house, my curiosity was aroused to find out why this English woman chose to publish a book in the Netherlands. It challenged me to discover if more women found their way to Rotterdam to publish their work and what their motives were. I found out that in the second half of the seventeenth century, more English women travelled to the Netherlands to seek refuge and two of them had their work published by Goddaeus: Katherine Sutton (1630-63) and Mary Hampson (1639-1698). Although they migrated in different time periods and for different reasons, they both seized the opportunity to publish their life experiences at a Dutch publishing house. Although the historical archives offer little to no information on the reason for their connection to Goddaeus, the fact that both women took their chance to publish their works while in exile, in their native language at a Dutch publishing house, triggered me to find out more. What follows here, is an overview of the cultural-historical context of the seventeenth century; an overview of connections and differences between English and Dutch society; the social impact of the seventeenth century printing industry; the position of women and their position to write; and ultimately how this culminates in the aim of these two women in particular, to pursue truth by making their life experiences public by means of print.","['Print Culture, Printing and the Public Sphere, Conversion Narratives, Early-Modern Literature, Life-writing, Anglo-Dutch connection, Women’s writing in the 17th century']"

EU Sanctioning Behavior in the Post-Lisbon Era: The European Parliament’s role in EU external relations in the Magnitsky case,"Wood, Catherine","['Gawthorpe, A.J.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,European Politics and Society: Vaclav Havel Joint Master Programme,Master thesis,en,"Despite a long history of scholarship about economic sanctions, research about European Union sanctions, specifically EU sanction threats, is more nascent. The institutional changes in the EU changes since the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009, which gave the European Parliament some increased powers whilst maintaining an intergovernmental Common Foreign and Security Policy, add to this research gap. This thesis thus attempts to answer the question, “What are the effects of the Treaty of Lisbon on the European Parliament’s role in sanctions decision-making?” Due to the EP’s significant role in the Magnitsky case and its high salience and implications for EU relations with third countries, this study uses the Magnitsky case in the EU to answer this question. It uses an explaining-outcome process-tracing method and finds that some legal changes did not make the EP more assertive in sanctions policy in the Magnitsky case. It does find that the EP ‘tested the waters’ by forging a greater connection between human rights and external relations. It also finds that the augmentation of the HRVP role led to a more difficult relationship between the EP and the Council in the Magnitsky case.","['sanctions, Magnitsky, European Parliament, EU external relations, Treaty of Lisbon, EU decision-making, High Representative']"
Counter-Memory Agents of Thatcherism. How British Filmmakers Challenge the Dominant Perceptions of the 1980s.,"Troost, Barbara","['Clemens, R.A.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In my thesis, I explore and compare three films issued in the decades after the 1980s for their representation of neglected regional working-class memory – for which I use the term counter-memory throughout my thesis – of Thatcher’s politics. Counter-memory presents the narratives of the people who struggle in the dominant culture. All three of the films in this corpus are directed by British filmmakers. The Commitments (1991), directed by Alan Parker, is set in Dublin, Ireland. Trainspotting (1996), directed by Danny Boyle, is set in Edinburgh, Scotland. Stephen Daldry’s Billy Elliot (2000) is set in County Durham, England. I critically examine how these films challenge or reinforce the capitalist hegemony of the 1980s and how their critique of society influences the memory of that era. Overall, I argue that the abovementioned films represent different sides of working-class counter-memory in a kaleidoscopic view of the same: counter-memory of the socio-economic effects of the political strategies in Britain and Ireland of the 1980s.","['Memory Studies', 'Counter-Memory', 'Thatcherism', 'British Film']"

The Chilean Constitution-Making Process(es): A Critical Discourse Analysis of Chilean Newspapers,"Lehmkuhl, Clara",['Rebeca Fernández Rodríguez'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Chile currently finds itself in the middle of a constitution-making process. This is the second attempt to replace the current constitution, since in 2015, the president at that time tried to launch a constitution-making process, which eventually failed. A large majority of the public sees the current constitution as responsible for the social and political problems in the country. One way to investigate how the public made this association between the constitution and social misery is to look at the media, especially newspapers. With the help of Critical Discourse Analysis, this thesis compares how newspapers reported on the different constitution-making processes in Chile (2015-2017 and 2019-2021), in order to detect underlying ideologies that could influence the public opinion. This paper argues that the discourse changed over the years, because in the first attempt, the newspapers mainly focused on the process itself. On the other hand, during the second constitution-making process, newspapers took a closer look into the potential content and form of a new constitution.","['Chile, Constitution, 2019, Pinochet']"

Security Realignment in Central Asia: The SCO RATS’ Unused Potential. To what degree has the SCO RATS provided opportunities for security realignment in Central Asia over the last decade?,"Schramm, Saskia",['I.M. Scarborough'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In light of the absence of Russian and Chinese responses to security related events in Central Asia, the security question of the region has gotten new attention. During mass unrests in 2022 in autonomous regions in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the two big, self-proclaimed security actors of the region presented a deafening silence and did not intervene. This bared the question about Central Asian security and a potential realignment in security. This paper investigates the extent to which the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (SCO RATS) has facilitated security realignment in Central Asia over the past decade. Employing a combination of the Regional Security Complex Theory with institutional liberalism, the study utilizes comparative historical analysis and content analysis to examine the evolving Central Asian security situation in 2013 and 2022. It specifically evaluates the degree to which the SCO RATS, designed for military exercise and intelligence on terrorism sharing, has influenced the security realignment. The findings have confirmed a clear security alignment and furthermore suggested a shift in focus and actors. In comparison to 2013, Russia’s and its organisations position as a security guarantor has significantly weakened in 2022. However, Russia’s weakening did not lead to a clear shift of Central Asian states security politics towards China or its security organisations. Instead, Central Asia has embraced a more multilateral security strategy, emphasizing collaborative efforts through joint bilateral exercises and interregional links, instead of relying on a singular outside actor like it did in 2013. Despite its objectives, the SCO RATS has not provided China or SCO itself with a definitive mechanism to reorient the region towards China’s security orbit. This research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the security dynamics in Central Asia of the last decade and the role played by the SCO RATS. By highlighting the region’s interconnectedness in various aspects of security and the security issues the region is facing, it underscores the need for exploration of the factors influencing security realignment and the region’s security politics to gain an understanding about the past and more important – the future of Central Asian security.","['SCO RATS, Central Asia, Security Realignment, Russia, China, SCO']"

Ownership of Heritage: A Critical Discourse Analysis of the Repatriation of Indonesian Artifacts in the Netherlands: The Case of the Java Man,"Sleebos, Tawny","['Engelenhoven, A.T.P.G. van']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Debates about the ownership of cultural heritage have been ongoing between colonizer and colonized countries. It has only been recently that the Netherlands has been reflective of its colonial history and has returned 472 looted art objects back to Indonesia that came into Dutch hands during the colonial period. However, Indonesia has been requesting the return of cultural heritage objects since the 1960s, with its aim to support a new national narrative of the Indonesian state. The Netherlands has been unwilling to return objects due to a loss of power in the colonies and a loss of cultural control. This thesis explores the colonial thought and power structures that underlie the discourse on the restitution of colonial artifacts, such as in the case study of the Java Man remains. By performing an adaptation of a Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and employing concepts such as heritage, universal value, looted, and restitution, this thesis argues that the Dutch state and institutions, such as Naturalis, claiming ownership of the looted artifacts proves to reflect the presence of a lingering colonial way of thinking, where the West is thought of as superior in terms of scientific research and architecture. The exhibition Early Humans where the Java Man remains are stored and presented, lacks information regarding the excavation of the artifacts and the colonial context they were found in. The lack of information regarding the colonial history reaffirms the power structures of the museum, linked to their colonial past of collecting. By analyzing the discourse surrounding the remains, this thesis aims to add how such colonial thinking and power structures have been reinforced through the debate of cultural heritage ownership.","['Indonesia', 'Dutch East Indies', 'Repatriation', 'Heritage Studies', 'Colonial History', 'Defining Artifacts', '(Universal) Museums']"

The influence of orthography on bilingual spoken word production using blocked cyclic picture naming,"Lambalgen, Leanne van",['Niels O. Schiller'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Previous psycholinguistic studies have established that orthography is involved in spoken word production when it is highly relevant to the task. Follow-up research by Wang et al. (2023) used blocked cyclic picture naming in Mandarin Chinese to show that orthographic information is activated even when it is not relevant to the task. The study found shorter naming reaction times when pictures were presented in an orthographically homogeneous condition than when they were presented in an orthographically heterogeneous condition, suggesting automatic activation of orthography in spoken word production. The present study replicated the paradigm used by Wang et al. (2023) on English-Dutch bilinguals and a monolingual English control group to investigate whether automatic activation of orthography occurs cross-linguistically and to what extent an effect still occurs when two orthographies are present in the mental lexicon. Current studies on bilingualism have found interference effects in semantics, syntax, and phonology, but no study on orthographic information in the bilingual mental lexicon has been carried out so far. A similar facilitative effect was found in both the English and Dutch groups, confirming the cross-linguistic existence of automatic orthographic activation in spoken word production. Furthermore, the Dutch group had significantly slower reaction times than the English group. These findings suggest that the orthographic information of the native language is automatically activated alongside the orthographic information of the second language, resulting in an interference effect","[': spoken word production, bilingualism, orthography, blocked cyclic picture naming']"
The acquisition of coda consonants in English: markedness or frequency?,"Lin, Jiayi","['Levelt, C.C']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the early coda production of an English-speaking child A. The study compares two influential frameworks in child language acquisition: Universal Grammar (UG) and the Specific Language Hypothesis (SLGH). While Universal Grammar predicts developmental patterns based on innate knowledge in language acquisition, the Specific Language Grammar Hypothesis proposes that the frequency patterns in specific languages mainly guide language acquisition. The two theoretical accounts make different predictions for the development of coda consonants, creating an exciting topic of study. Data analysis in this thesis reveals that while child A's productions align with projections posited by Universal Grammar, it also suggests an influence from the distribution of coda consonants in English. By combining Universal Grammar and the Specific Language Grammar Hypothesis, this research found that Frequency-Based Hypothesis contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of child language acquisition. It provides valuable insights into the intricate processes involved.",['Language Acquisition']

"Sojourners, Sailors, and Sex Workers: The Development of Yantai’s Leisure Industries in the context of Semicolonialism, 1919-1941","Fennema, Marijn",['Dr. Limin Teh'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis is a study on how leisure industries operated under semicolonial circumstances in Republican China (specifically between 1919 and 1941). Taking place in Yantai, a medium-sized treaty port in China’s Shandong province, this study analyzes how leisure, in the form of sex work, was both “sought” and “provided” by different actors. This study specifically zooms in on two of these actors. Firstly, sailors of the United States Asiatic Fleet are analyzed, as this research explores how their intertwining pursuits of drinking alcohol and visiting sex workers impacted Yantai and its inhabitants. Secondly, this study delves into the lives of Yantai’s sex workers, and how their role within Yantai’s sex work industry operated during an era of semicolonial presence. This study reveals that Yantai provided sailors the opportunity to indulge themselves in vices without being judged by their surroundings in a way that they would back home. Furthermore, although their behavior was certainly not appreciated by both locals and nonlocals in Yantai, their pursuits were also tolerated by some, as they contributed to both the economic and military interests of those that interacted with them. Sex workers, on the other hand, were a demographic that underwent significant changes throughout Yantai’s Republican period, which can largely be attributed to the increasing demands for sex work by foreign sailors. Yantai’s sex work industry became notably more internationally-oriented, as shown by both international sex workers flocking to the city and the general services offered by sex workers gradually revolving more around sexual intercourse. Overall, this study reveals how demands for new forms of sex work reshaped the hierarchies of Yantai’s overall sex work industry. As a result, the industry became more asymmetrically skewed towards a foreign clientele under semicoloniality. Furthermore, Yantai’s smaller size and the relatively large number of visiting sailors made these developments more contrasting than in other cities, resulting in heavier contention, discourse and conflicts arising from these developments.",

Urban water security, a concept that concerns adequate water provisioning to urban areas, is therefore becoming a more eminent topic. This concept sets forth the importance of taking into account the provisioning of water as an interrelated concept. Urban water security is intersected with other issues such as equality and justice in water access, accommodating the principle of access to water as a right. Guaranteeing urban water security and the implementation of such policies is notably influenced by different water governance perspectives and the other way around as well. The concept of water governance entails different dimensions of political, organisational and administrative processes via which public concerns are incorporated, decisions are implemented and governments are held responsible for the management and improvement of water resources and services regarding water delivery. This thesis will analyse the water management situation in Amsterdam in the 1930’s and 1940’s through examination of changing urban water security and water governance problems and solutions. Furthermore, lessons learned from the water management in Amsterdam in the 1930’s and 1940’s will be used to think about solving current water management problems in regard to climate change.","['Water Governance, Urban Water Security, Sewage, City Cleaning, Drinking Water']"

The UN WPS Agenda is being criticised for its Western centric and liberal character, its facilitation of militarisation and the inefficiency of the related National Action Plans. The case study analysis of Indonesia explores the impact of the agenda on gender equality in Indonesia, specifically in counterterrorism. It will be concluded that the WPS agenda operates within a system of underlying patriarchal and neo-colonialist structures that result in asymmetrical power relations between the UN and countries of the Global South. These structures impair the agenda’s ability to create justice for non-white women, as it is based on methods of exclusion and the status quo of domination at their expense. The WPS Agenda therefore lacks transformative potential. Instead, it serves to perpetuate patriarchal and neo-colonial power imbalances.","['Women Peace and Security Agenda, counterterrorism, gender, Indonesia']"

The thesis draws upon a mix of primary and secondary sources to emphasise the active role of the Moroccan government in maximising the developmental potential of migration through a comprehensive Diaspora engagement policy. Continuing, it discusses the role of economic remittances on the development of housing, which has triggered economic growth and the emergence of new urban centres in historically isolated regions of Morocco, thus, raising living standards and expanding educational opportunities in rural areas of Morocco. Finally, this thesis demonstrates that Morocco is taking serious steps towards reducing the negative effects of the “brain drain” through programmes specifically aimed at increasing cooperation with and incentivizing the return of highly skilled Moroccan migrants. By exploring the implications of Moroccan migration beyond economic remittances, this thesis provides an overall picture of the various migration-related factors at play in the development of Morocco. It aims to highlight the significance of other factors often overshadowed by an overwhelmingly large focus on economic remittances alone in academia.","['Migration', 'Diaspora', 'Development', 'Remittances', 'Brain drain', 'Morocco', 'Africa.']"

Covid-19 and Organized Crime: A Comparative Study of Criminal Governance in Mexico and Brazil During the Pandemic,"Berthet, Emile","['Dr. Solheim, H.A.S.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Governance constitutes an important feature of organized crime. Across the world, millions of people live under criminal governance. In such cases, criminal organizations are involved in enforcing rules and collecting taxes, providing security, as well as offering basic goods and services. This phenomenon primarily takes place in areas of weak state presence, where the government fails to satisfy the population's basic needs such as physical and social security. As of today, criminal governance remains particularly widespread throughout Latin America. Indeed, the region suffers from high levels of violence and public insecurity, which bear significant impacts on social, economic, and political life. The states of Mexico and Brazil, in particular, are home to some of the largest criminal organizations in the world. The latter include cartels and gang networks of various sizes and organizational structures. In turn, the same organizations have been involved in establishing localized governance practices in their respective countries. Despite being a well-researched concept in academia, criminal governance remains understudied in contexts of crisis. The states of Brazil and Mexico have been greatly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and its negative socioeconomic impacts. In addition, the said crisis profoundly altered the environment in which criminal organizations operate. Using a comparative case study methodology, this thesis, therefore, investigates the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on criminal governance practices from criminal groups in Mexico and Brazil. In doing so, it aims to form a better understanding of how criminal organizations adapted their governance activities to the health crisis.","['Criminal Governance', 'Organized Crime', 'Crisis', 'Covid-19', 'Coronavirus', 'Pandemic', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Cartels', 'Gangs']"

Integration policy in Dutch municipalities: A policy discourse analysis of public policy briefs,"Nijland, Lianne",['S. Kersbergen'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis uses a policy discourse analysis to examine the dominant discourses and values embedded in integration policy briefs from six Dutch municipalities: Breda, Den Haag, Dronten, Midden-Groningen, Oude Ijsselstreek, and Tilburg. In 2022, the responsibility for immigrant integration in the Netherlands partly shifted from a national to a municipal responsibility (Rijksoverheid n.d.). The analysis reveals key insights about the integration policies of these municipalities. While the dominant overlapping theme in the briefs is a focus on inclusivity and language proficiency, there are remarkable differences found between the municipalities, reflecting a diversity of values and priorities that occurs when shifting part of the responsibility for immigrant integration from a national level to a local level. This thesis also considers the concept of path dependency, as discussed by Kay, which illuminates the influence of historical policy shifts, from non-acceptance to tolerance, multiculturalism, and assimilation, on current policy briefs. The compatibility and adoption of multiculturalism and assimilation strategies are examined within the context of each municipality.",

Chapter 1 discusses relevant scholarly literature which explains the concepts of populism, Euroscepticism, Dutch right-wing political parties, Muslim immigration and integration in the Netherlands and illustrates the suitable cultural, political, and economic dimensions. Furthermore, Chapter 2 presents the methodology; a qualitative framing analysis applied to the PVV and FvD party manifestos. This thesis examines three levels demonstrating how Muslim immigrants and the EU are framed as a threat to Dutch society. These dimensions are separated into three chapters: the cultural, political, and economic dimensions. Chapter 3 presents the cultural dimension and analyzes the themes of national identity preservation, cultural clashes, stereotyping, and scapegoating. Moreover, Chapter 4 composes the political dimension with subchapters on the anti-establishment stance of the parties, national sovereignty threat, and policy proposals. The last chapter, Chapter 5, constructs the economic dimension and comprises the perceived financial burden, welfare state threat, and exclusive economic cooperation. Lastly, a discussion of the framing analysis of the manifestos and concluding remarks are presented.","['Muslim immigration', 'European Union', 'framing']"

Breaking Sectarianism: Lebanon's 17 October Uprising,"Rieser, Spencer","['Valadbaygi, K.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Lebanon’s 17 October Uprising marked a watershed moment in the country’s history as it challenged the very foundation of the political system: sectarian power-sharing. It was the largest and most diverse protest movement in decades and its anti-sectarian stature was entirely unprecedented. For the first time, many Lebanese called on their confessional leaders to resign. This thesis examines firstly why the uprising directed its focus toward political sectarianism as a primary cause of Lebanon’s political and economic plight. The inability or unwillingness of sectarian leaders to deliver basic services to their constituents created a situation in which Lebanese across all sects were more united than ever before in their collective plight. Second, it explores the timing of the uprising in the fall of 2019. It argues that the uprising was the culmination of simmering resentments that finally erupted as a result of deteriorating economic conditions, political corruption, and a series of disasters that the government failed to prevent or address. Lastly, the thesis investigates how the uprising helped propel anti-sectarian ideas that were previously taboo into mainstream political discourse. While the 17 October Uprising ultimately failed to achieve its objective of establishing a secular rather than sectarian political order, it stands as the most significant challenge to political sectarianism in the country’s history and could pave the way for future mobilizations in the same vein. This thesis will contribute to the nascent body of literature on the 17 October Uprising and the broader scholarship on sectarian power-sharing as a system of governance.","['Lebanon', '17 October Uprising', 'Sectarianism', 'Consociationalism', 'Power-sharing', 'Neoliberalism']"

A Fear of Missing Out amongst university students; less urban vs more urban living,"Niewold, Pheebe","['Broeke, P. ten', 'Krakowska Rodrigues, K.K.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines the association between living in an urban environment and perceived feelings of missing out (FoMO) among university students. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, my study explores a potential relationship between urban living and FoMO levels and reasons for students' experience of FoMO. The central research question focuses on how living in an urban environment as a student relates to the experience of FoMO. My study conducts a statistical analysis, specifically Kendall's correlation coefficient, to examine the association between living urban and levels of FoMO. Surprisingly, the results show no significant association, which may be attributed to the small sample size used in the study. Therefore, future research with larger and more diverse samples is needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between urban living and FoMO among university students. Additionally, my study conducts thematic analysis, revealing differences in the reasons behind FoMO experiences among students living in more urban and less urban environments. Students in urban settings often mention roommates as a source of FoMO, while students in less urban environments report different reasons. These findings highlight the influence of social dynamics and environmental factors specific to different urban settings on FoMO experiences. The research underscores the importance of investigating both online and offline factors contributing to FoMO. While existing literature primarily focuses on online factors, such as social media use, my study emphasises the need to explore offline factors, including living with many opportunities for social connection and physical proximity to social events. Understanding the multifaceted nature of FoMO can help in developing more effective strategies to reduce people’s experienced levels and address the associated negative mental health effects among university students. In conclusion, this study finds no significant association between living in an urban environment and FoMO levels among university students. It highlights the necessity for future research with larger and more diverse samples, while also emphasising the importance of investigating both online and offline factors contributing to FoMO experiences. This can in the future help to develop better strategies and interventions to reduce FoMO and the added negative mental health effects among university students.","['FoMO', 'Fear of Missing Out', 'Students', 'Urban Living', 'College', 'Social']"

The Influence of International Organizations on National Social Protection Systems: The Case of the International Labour Organization and Mexico,"Ciu, Mara-Cătălina","['Amann, Edmund']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"By seeking to explore the development of social protection national policy, this thesis has sought to contribute to the field of global social policy, by delving into the role and influence of international organizations with regards to national social protection systems. This research has scrutinised the way Mexico applied conventions related to social protection devised by the International Labour Organisation and developed its national social protection system since 1931 (when it joined the organisation) until present. Through a historical approach, it has been demonstrated how Mexico's changing economic systems have conditioned the applicability of the internationally-devised norms of the ILO to its national context. This finding aligns with the scholarly view on international norm compliance according to which states do not always defy internationally-imposed directives willingly, but are rather conditioned by national events or circumstances of a socio-economic or political order. It has thus been concluded that the Lost Decade of the 1980s represented a moment of upheaval and economic change (from state-led industrialization to market-led economy) that influenced the effectiveness of the ILO's norms on Mexico's social protection system.","['social protection', 'social security', 'international organizations', 'international norms', 'norm compliance', 'Latin America', 'Mexico', 'International Labour Organisation']"

Specifically, the the construction, preservation, dissemination, of the official narrative is examined against the background of socio-political dynamics. The function and characteristics of the official narrative are considered. The official state narrative and constructed memory of an absolute Egyptian victory serve as a tool of legitimization for the Sadat and Mubarak regimes. Conversely, the counter-narrative of Shazly, which does not claim absolute victory and highlights crucial failures, exemplifies hermeneutical dissidence. This research examines the initial suppression of Shazly's counter-narrative and its eventual salience. It argues that changes in the socio-political landscape, specifically during the last years of the Mubarak regime and during the 2011 uprisings, facilitated the outbreak and public embrace of Shazly's counter-narrative of the war. This outbreak inflicted a hermeneutical fissure in the official war narrative and memory.","['War Memory, Official Memory, Discourse, Narrative, October War 1973, Egypt']"

However, domestic challenges in Venezuela make a sustainable transition to democracy challenging. Venezuela has seen massive levels of democratic backsliding under the presidency of both Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro. Particularly, Maduro’s presidency has been riddled with severe economic crisis and human rights abuses. While the international community has been involved for several years, their use of negotiations and sanctions have not been successful in causing a regime change. By analyzing the literature on Venezuela and policy papers I identify the obstacles to a democratic transition.

An Argument Based on the Three Pillars of Economic, Social, and Ecological Framework of Sustainability","Nix, Lisa S",['Hanno Jentzch'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis addressed the question of whether Japanese coastal fishing is economically, socially, and ecologically sustainable or not. To answer the research question; “Based on the three pillars of economic, social, and ecological sustainability, is Japan the last developed country to have resource co-management in coastal fishery?”, although in the past coastal fishing was self-sufficient, had a higher role in the economy, and had a strong management system, recent changes in demographics, economic decline, and marine resource loss brought a negative change to this. Additionally, reforms to reduce production costs led to more imports, which further damaged the coastal fishery. Moreover, the decline in the economy affected the society in coastal areas in a way that the low and unstable income of coastal fishery made it less desirable for people, leading to fewer successors. Urbanization and the ageing population in rural areas also led to a shortage in coastal fishing successors and an overall decline in coastal areas. Economic and social sustainability negatively affect each other in a way that as the economy in coastal fishery goes down, young people leave these communities and leading to a shortage of successors, which further leads to economic decline. Finally, the change in the fishery from small-scale family-owned fishery to industrialised fishery is causing exploitation that is damaging the environment.","['sustainability, Japanese coastal fishery']"

Easing the pain of life together: Menhera as an online community,"Gondar Romero, Cristina",['Angelika Koch-Low'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The term menhera, originally an Internet term, has taken on various meanings. To date, the academic literature has focused primarily on the meaning of the word in popular culture. There has been little research on the meaning of menhera as an Internet language and the perspective of those who identify with it. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis was to find the meaning of menhera for those who identify with it in an online community. A content analysis was conducted on a Discord server called Sick Miss. The analysis revealed that for the members of Sick Miss, the term menhera does not mean a set of particular characteristics or a specific disorder. Instead, menhera encompasses all mental disorders and the members specify their illness by using terms from the DSM-V. Furthermore, Sick Miss members express their illness through pain; expressing it primarily as the pain of living. The reason for members to join the server is to join a community of people for mutual support. The analysis has shown that in the context of an online community, the meaning of menhera is to ease the pain of life together.","['Menhera, Mental Health, Japan, Online Community']"

Consumer awareness and participation in the Circular Economy: A case study of the second-hand clothing fashion in the city of Amsterdam,"Brunetti, Sara S B",['Glenn Aguilar Hernandez + S.Kersbergen'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The fashion industry is a major contributor to the negative environmental impacts on the planet. Therefore, the need to diminish the consumption of clothing and adopt a more sustainable manner of doing fashion has become imperative. The upcoming approach of Circular Economy (CE) proposes a framework for achieving sustainability by reducing, reusing, recycling, and recovering materials. Within this context, second-hand clothing represents a practice of the CE which emphasizes the concept of reusing and maximizing the lifespan of textile materials. The enhancement of this practice can have positive environmental impacts on the planet. For the actual implementation and success of this practice, the role of consumers and their engagement is relevant. Several worldwide studies have already explored consumers’ awareness and participation in the second-hand clothing market but none, to the knowledge of the researcher, concerning Amsterdam, the capital city of the Netherlands. Therefore, this thesis will focus on Amsterdam and tries to gain insights by posing the following research question: To what extent are consumers in Amsterdam aware of and participating in the circular economy practice of second-hand clothing? Specifically, to investigate this matter, the research was conducted through the distribution of an online survey with the participation of 77 consumers. Results showed a generally high level of awareness but a lower level of active participation in the CE practice of second-hand clothing. This study may provide valuable insights, not only, to the municipality of Amsterdam but also to a wide range of other stakeholders involved in the second-hand clothing market, with the overall aim of enhancing the adoption of CE and the second-hand clothing practice.","['circular economy, consumers, second-hand clothing, Amsterdam, Fashion, sustainability']"

Its producer contrasts her theory predominantly with the International Relations concept of realism. This paper tests the validity of NMT through a primary source based analysis of US foreign policy decisions resolving around the1972 Shanghai Communiqué. Specifically, it answers whether NMT can be used to explain the development of US-PRC-ROC relations shortly prior, during, and shortly after the signing of the Communiqué, with the caveat that it only interacts with part of the theory. It furthermore adds to a more general debate on the validity of NMT in IR. The former question it answers slightly supportively. On the overarching question it remains neutral, due to ambiguous nature of part of the theory. The author believes that, though currently incomplete, NMT carries the potential to bring IR further as a field, and hence urges others to adjust, finetune and especially narrow-down the theory based on further case studies.","['National Mythmaking Theory, US-PRC Relations, US-ROC Relations, PRC-ROC Relations, Shanghai Communique, Taiwan Dispute, US Foreign Policy']"
"Exploring the potential impact of gamification on water consumption data collection in The Hague, The Netherlands.","Debenedet, Agustin","['Flohr, M.', 'Aguilar Hernandez, G.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Cities and their populations are constantly growing, and this is putting a great strain on the planet’s resources. Cities consume 75% of all the global natural resources, one of which is water. The city’s density and economic activity affect the distribution of these resources and it is one of the reasons why cities are turning to the Smart City concept. This allows cities to use technology to gather large amounts of real time data and adjust the existing and future plans. However, more data is needed to help these adjustments become more effective. Some researchers have turned towards the citizens as the prime generators of data, calling it citizen science. As a result, methods which motivate citizens to adopt the smart city technology are essential to enable data generation. This research focused on the following question: How can gamification theory facilitate the data collection for urban water management models in the city of The Hague? Through literature research and a questionnaire, the research showed how gamification can help generate more data by motivating the citizens of The Hague. By using the existing water management system as a basis, implementing gamification characteristics which influence the user’s utilitarian perspective like badges, overview tables, notifications and rewards, a user can become more motivated to use the water consumption system, generate data which can be used by urban water management models and ultimately make cities a more sustainable environment.","['Smart City', 'Urban Water Management', 'Motivation', 'Citizen Science', 'Gamification']"

Through a critical constructivist approach, the study explores how South Korea’s collective memory of historical experiences with Japan has influenced South Korea's foreign policy decisions and bilateral relations with Japan from 2012 to 2023. The findings show that the increasing need for security cooperation reconstructs South Korea’s national identity. South Korea’s colonial memories have impeded an approach toward future-oriented policies regarding the GSOMIA. However, under the current Yoon administration, South Korea appears to prioritize bilateral security cooperation with Japan instead of reproducing the historical disputes, resulting in the improvement of South Korea-Japan relations. This study contributes to the current scholarship on identity and IR by showing how state identity shapes international relations, with a focus on how state identity articulations in foreign policy manifest and transform amidst increasing security threats, and its impact on bilateral ties.","['South Korea', 'regional security', 'GSOMIA', 'ROK-Japan bilateral relations', 'foreign policy', 'postcolonial state identity', 'critical constructivism']"

The Implementation of Green Roofs: Stakeholder Challenges in Rotterdam,"Schmit, Noam",['Dr. Mingming Hu'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper examines the roles and perspectives of various stakeholders regarding green roof adoption in Rotterdam. The research aims to understand what actions can be undertaken by different stakeholders in order for green roof adoption to be accelerated and its many benefits to be yielded. A literature review was undertaken to examine barriers to green roof adoption as well as to explore the best practices in cities leading in green roofs: Chicago and Basel. Over the course of three structured interviews, the applicability of the best practices to Rotterdam was determined. The findings show that Rotterdam is limited financially and in terms of power over building demands. However, the municipality of Rotterdam, together with other important stakeholders involved with green roofs - such as installation companies or maintenance workers - can collaborate efficiently to raise awareness and reach a common goal: to increase the presence of (multifunctional) green roofs. This collaboration could exist in the form of quantitative research to publish facts and data about the positive impacts of green roofs in Rotterdam, or through qualitative interviews that aim to learn about the generally positive experiences of green roof owners.","['Green roofs', 'Stakeholders', 'Urban greening', 'Rotterdam']"
Feminization of migration: The impact of Moroccan Women’s migration to Italy on Morocco,"Accame, Beatrice",['Walter Knwi Gam'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The present study investigates on Moroccan women’s migration to Italy and its effects on the social, political, and economic conditions of Morocco. Through interviews with specialized professionals, as well as an in-depth analysis of scholarly literature, NGOs and government documentation, this research highlights the consequences of this migration flow that connects Morocco and Italy. The thesis provides a comprehensive overview of the causes of migration for Moroccan women, considering social ties, cultural and religious implications, political attitudes, and economic opportunities. The analysis includes the obstacle faced by Moroccan women during their migration journey, from the pre-departure stage to the settlement in Italy. These difficulties may derive from social integration, cultural adaptation, and access to the labor market. Moreover, the study delves into the social, cultural, and religious repercussions of this migration flows. Particularly on family dynamics, gender norms, and women empowerment. It also explores the changes in political attitudes that are consequences of living in a democratic regime and adjusting to different living standards. Additionally, the study focuses on the role of remittances in the economic status of Morocco, mentioning financial fulfillment, and the Moroccan case of mismatching highly qualified nationals in the job market. Overall, this thesis will contribute to the current academic literature by filling the gap on the role that gender has in migration flows, especially in countries of origin, such as Morocco. By using a qualitative method of research, comprising of interviews and official documentations, it provides a valuable insight into the experiences of Moroccan women migrating to Italy. Furthermore, it wants to encourage future research on the feminization of migration and gender studies.",

Linguistic Humor Strategies in Greek and American Observational Stand-up Comedy: A Contrastive Analysis,"Koulopoulos, Nikolaos","['Terkourafi, M.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis presents a contrastive analysis between the observational stand-up comedies of the Greek Lambros Fisfis and the American Jim Gaffigan. The analysis criterion was the different linguistic devices used on the grounds of the first Knowledge Resource, the Language, offered by the General Theory of Verbal Humor (Attardo & Raskin 1991), the four Humor Identification Forms (Shade 1996), and the five levels of linguistic analysis (morphology, syntax, phonetics-phonology, semantics, and pragmatics). To what extent does each comedian rely on the different linguistic devices corresponding to the five levels of linguistic analysis to elicit laughter from the audience? Subsequently, how different or similar is each comedian’s approach regarding the different levels of analysis from which they draw their devices and the different types of the devices themselves? To answer these questions, I present a comparative analysis of the linguistic devices used in 15 clips from Fisfis’ playlist on YouTube, “Να ένας Σοφός” (Here is a Wise Man) and Gaffigan’s playlist on YouTube, “Laugh Society” respectively. The results suggest that both comedians relied mainly on the Verbal Humor Identification Form, and Fisfis used more devices than Gaffigan on the morphological, phonetic-phonological, and pragmatic levels. Gaffigan, on the other hand, used more devices than Fisfis on the syntactic and semantic levels.","['Observational Stand-up Comedy, General Theory of Verbal Humor, Contrastive analysis, Humor identification forms']"

Through a constructivist and critical lens it explores how Indigenous, brown and black identities were repressed by and resisted the construction of ‘White Argentina’, and how Identidad Marrón as an embodiment of these identities is challenging the white national archetype. After identifying a knowledge gap regarding brown identities, it is argued that since its foundation and despite its hegemony the white nation and its whitening policies have been in continuous negotiation with non-white identities, whose resistance through violent means, such as malones – raids primarily carried out by Mapuche people, and art, writing and poetry were constructed as a threat. At present, Identidad Marrón and its antiracist discourses (re)emerged as a challenge to ‘White Argentina’ through two modes of resistance: writing disseminated through protest and art. The interrelation between the antiracist movement and Argentina's nation-building process is analyzed through Primary Source Analysis and Critical Discourse Analysis. Finally, studying social movements akin to Identidad Marrón and their link to nation-building endavours in Latin America and beyond and thereby creating a body of research and societal narratives that counter racialized representations of people of colour can inspire change by giving recognition to marginalized identities, such as marrones, questioning exclusionary foundational myths and dismantling structural and systemic racism to lead the way into an increasingly inclusive future.","['identity formation', 'nation-building', 'structural racism', 'antiracism', 'social movements']"

Existing literature lacks consistency and a clear overview of what fields should be part of SSC frameworks, as demonstrated by the variety of proposed frameworks, dimensions, indicators, and fields. For this reason, this thesis researched one possible path to an improved framework – through lessons on Circular Economy (CE). CE practices are being applied to cities at an increasing rate and the insights from their frameworks could advance SSC. Through asystematic literature review of the implementations of both concepts – CE and SSC, an overview of the most common fields has been offered, and lessons from CE applied to SSC. This thesis answered the research question: How can Circular Economy contribute to the Smart Sustainable City framework? The results are summarized in an improved comprehensive framework for Smart Sustainable City,divided into four dimensions with 23 strategic fields. Innovation, business, tourism, local resources, building sector, and food were among fields strongly supported byCE literature, while SSC models seemed not to realize all of their potentials. This review provides a thorough overview of the state of the affairs on the topic, offering a starting point for future research. This framework can be used for multiple purposes, from developing indicators for assessing a city’s progress towards becoming an SSC to offering guidance on where to implement smart sustainable solutions.",['Smart Sustainable City - Circular Economy - City - Sustainable Development – Amsterdam']

‘CRT’ in Schools as Moral Panic: Examining the Narrative of Its Most Prominent Crusader,"Noel, Anne","['Baarssen, G.H.J.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Over the past three years, ‘Critical Race Theory’ in schools has evoked considerable backlash from conservatives fearing progressive indoctrination. This has been referred to as an instance of moral panic by liberal journalists, yet their claims are not informed by sociological theory. Thus far, moral panic scholars have not studied the phenomenon. This thesis bridges the gap between media allegations and scholarly inquiry and examines the personal narrative of the most prominent ‘CRT’ opponent: Christopher Rufo. A qualitative content analysis uncovered Rufo’s narrative. Subsequently, the results were interpreted within the moral panic framework and complemented by the existing literature on ‘CRT’ in schools. The research concludes that Rufo’s personal narrative supports moral panic allegations by containing evidence for all five elements of moral panic. While this effort is largely exploratory, the results indicate the utility of further research considering ‘CRT’ in schools as a moral panic.","['moral panic', 'CRT laws', 'Project 1619', 'critical race theory', 'CRT', 'Christopher Rufo', 'US', 'Goode and Ben-Yehuda', 'Stanley Cohen']"

Barmentlo'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Around the world, urban governors are confronted with the task to protect their inhabitants against the effects of climate change. To take such measures, developers nowadays turn more towards nature-based solutions. For instance, the Henriëttewaard in ‘s-Hertogenbosch has been chosen for nature development to contribute to the city’s resilience as part of the Green Delta Program. By gaining insight and incorporating the demands of stakeholders into area plans, a more inclusive nature-based solution can be developed which increases support for these types of projects. This study aims to investigate how stakeholder objectives can be aligned with the potential ecosystem services and nature-based solutions elements in the Henriëttewaard. A literature survey and a survey with qualitative and quantitative questions were used to get insights into stakeholder demands for ecosystem services, as stakeholder participation can significantly improve the quality of spatial development projects. Results reveal that through potential ecosystem services mapping and engaging stakeholders in setting objectives for the Henriëttewaard, bottlenecks surface, and connections form, which allows the alignment of objectives and NbS elements. The main bottleneck is the disagreement among stakeholders about allowing agricultural activities in the Henriëttewaard. Fostering deliberation, cooperation, and knowledge-sharing among stakeholders, will support aligning objectives like recreation, sustainable agriculture, and climate resilience with potential ecosystem services. This research contributes to the integration of nature-based solutions in the Henriëttewaard, supporting the overall importance of facilitating inclusivity and quality. It expands existing knowledge by identifying what challenges can be expected in similar projects. Notwithstanding the limited sample, this research offers clarification into the complexities of stakeholder engagement in nature-based solution projects that are key to creating a livable city.","['natural resources, engagement, green engineering, adaptive cities.']"

Minimal Pair Contexts Indicate a Specified Underlying Representation of Onset Consonant Clusters in 2-year-old Children,"Galindo Jong, Saskia","['Levelt, C']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The rapid development of language that occurs in childhood is unparalleled. In their second year, children start learning how to produce onset consonant clusters. It has been proposed that children’s deviant cluster productions may be due to an incomplete underlying representation. The present study investigates this proposition by adapting the study done by Baese-Berk and Goldrick (2009) and employing a picture-naming paradigm with two conditions: a Minimal Pair condition wherein the critical difference between the two labels is the onset consonant cluster versus a singleton identical onset consonant and a Random Pair condition in which the target cluster word is paired with a completely different label. It was expected that if children possessed a specified underlying representation of onset clusters, there would be a notable difference in their attempts to produce the onset cluster between experimental conditions. Results from the 8 participants show that the Minimal Pair condition triggered a small increase in complete cluster production, thereby revealing that the representation of minimal pair cluster and non-cluster words are underlyingly different. This supports the claim that 2-year-old Dutch children possess an underlying representation of onset consonant clusters. Hence, children’s deviant production of clusters must be due to problems later in the speech production mechanism.","['Form-encoding mechanism', 'speech production', 'child language acquisition', 'onset consonant clusters', 'minimal pairs']"

The manifestation of religion in Moroccan foreign policy,"Soussi, Saloua",['Jelle Bruning'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Every year, Morocco sends hundreds of imams to different countries in Europe during Ramadan to support the local Moroccan community. They are sent by the Foundation Hassan II, a foundation safeguarding the cultural and religious identity of the diaspora. This research focuses on this institution and examines the ways in which religion is manifested in foreign policy in relation to the diaspora in the Netherlands. This is done by analyzing a national policy called the Stratégie Nationale en faveur des Marocains du Monde by the Ministère chargé des Marocains Résidant à l’Etranger et des Affaires de la Migration. In the case of the Netherlands, religion is mainly manifested by sending religious personnel and materials. In general, Morocco emphasizes a return transnationalism within its policy by motivating contributing to the country’s development, but also return to Morocco. This return transnationalism was first visible in the terminology that Morocco used to refer to the migrants which were underlinging the economic purposes of the migration. This later evolved into a term that also emphasized cultural and religious elements. Furthermore, various institutions were found to represent the interests of the diaspora, including the Fondation, but this system is not flawless because their cooperation can be ineffective. The study also covers the invention of “Moroccan Islam” as a colonial construct and the Moroccan interpretation of Islam that consist of four pillars. These pillars are also visible in the Strategy for example by emphasizing the Maliki Madhhab or moderate nature of the Moroccan interpretation of Islam.","['Religious policy', 'Moroccan diaspora', 'Islam']"

"“Clear as the Spotless Sun”: Honour, Reputation, and Self-Fashioning in the Career and Memoirs of Amir Khan of Tonk","Beentjes, John",['Jos J. L. Gommans'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Historians of the late pre-colonial Indian political and military landscape have often pointed to the prevalence of self-interested pragmatism, intrigue and shifting allegiances within it. Against this backdrop, this thesis examines a prominent, yet understudied, military and political player within late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century India, Amir Khan of Tonk, through the lens of martial honour. This is done through analysis of both his career and memoirs, the Amirnama, in which he is represented as one “whose conduct and character within and without were clear as the spotless sun”. Following the Amirnama’s account of the four main stages of his career, whilst also cross-referencing with other relevant contemporary sources, reveals the complex and manifold relation of theoretical ideals of martial honour with the realities of political and military action within his world. During the early stages of his career, cultivating a reputation for bravery and clemency on the battlefield facilitated his social climbing, enhancing “his fame and rank” and forging valuable alliances. Yet increasingly, a gulf appeared between the rhetoric and reality. Whilst honour could legitimise political action, it also contrasted sharply with the flexibility of allegiance, use of deception and even murder increasingly deployed by Amir Khan to achieve his ambitions and strategic aims. Ultimately, securing his political survival in the face of encroaching British power would necessitate jettisoning a plethora of social obligations to those with whom he was theoretically “honour-bound”. Examining Amir Khan’s self-fashioning in the Amirnama in light of these controversial acts reveals how the gap between the theoreticals of martial honour and the murkier realities of realpolitik pragmatism could be, at least rhetorically, reconciled.","['Indian History', 'Honour', 'Mercenaries', 'Afghan Diaspora', 'Anglo-Maratha Wars', 'Pindaris']"

The Desert is Neutral: An Analysis of British Policymaking in Oman during the Reign of Said bin Taimur (1934–1970),"O'Donovan, Cian","['Kefford, Alistair']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Oman has played an essential but peripheral role in the British Empire. Colonial endeavours in Oman were mixed, both fruitful and limited. These efforts exemplify how British colonialism in the area developed and how policymaking evolved based on context, ideology, or conflict. Many of these ideological differences came from the British need for oil, to secure it and to compete with the other powers involved in the Middle East. This thesis will analyse British documentation under the reign of Said bin Taimur to understand how these facets of British policymaking in Oman developed and how the development of this state was to the benefit of the British. Existing studies have examined the British in Oman, but from the perspective of military history and occupation or in a wider survey work context. This project focuses on the diplomatic, bureaucratic, and institutional nexus that guided the creation of the Omani state and its infrastructure to the benefit of the British establishment and oil companies. This thesis will examine this nexus in detail to examine how its expression influenced the development of the relationship between the Omani Sultanate and the British.","['Oman, Colonialism, Oil, British Empire, Decolonialism, Arab Nationalism, Democracy, Gulf Area, Pan-Arabism, Ibadhism, Communism,']"

Hippie Trail Collectors and Shifting Imaginations: An Analysis of (Post)Colonial Knowledge Production about Indonesian Textiles,"Veen, Renée van","['Bloembergen, M.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study examines the colonial dynamics of knowledge production about Indonesian textiles in the collecting practices of hippie trail collectors Rudolf Smend and Mary Hunt Kahlenberg. Its focus is on the private collections of these individuals, which are documented in multiple catalogues, and their engagement with these objects as textile experts. The study demonstrates the scholarly relevance of the ‘hippie trail collector’ as an analytical category and asserts its implication in the ongoing epistemological, ontological, and territorial colonialism foundational to and perpetuated by the hippie trail. To analyse the case studies, it first establishes the enmeshment of these collectors with the hippie trail network, it then examines their contributions to knowledge production about Indonesian textiles, and lastly it explores their engagement with the epistemological hierarchies regarding these objects. It argues that both Smend and Kahlenberg have aided the incorporation of Indonesian textiles into a Western art system, a venture which has a colonial genealogy but also fits with the countercultural period’s renewed international interest in textile arts. Through said revaluation as well as the co-option and capitalization on Indonesian expertise, these collectors promote the erasure of other meanings and reproduce the colonial underpinnings of knowledge production about these textiles.","['Indonesia, colonialism, textiles, hippie trail, collectors, knowledge production, Rudolf Smend, Mary Hunt Kahlenberg, agency, art, dress, craft, spirituality']"
