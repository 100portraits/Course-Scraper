Re-embodying Cognition in Colonial Discourses through Findings in Ethnography and Material Culture Studies,"Borm, Jip","['Eze, M.O.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"With the grounding of Cartesian mind-body dualism in modern European philosophy the mind has been granted a pivotal place in the field of epistemology. As a result, knowledge production is predominantly considered a disembodied enterprise. Over the last century critiques have been formulated against placing knowledge within the perimeters of the mind. For one, the phenomenological tradition offered an influential critique against the separability of mind, body as well as the external world in which the cognisant being finds oneself. Despite providing a powerful argument against disembodied theories of knowledge it appears the applicability of such a phenomenological theory falls short when transcending knowledge on the level of individual experience. This research takes a different approach in critiquing a disembodied understanding of knowledge. Through findings in ethnography and material culture studies it becomes clear knowledge cannot be confined to the internal mental processes of individual subjects. These two research fields bring special attention to firstly, the distributive nature of knowledge amongst collectivities and secondly, the shared epistemological and ontological aspects of knowledge amongst groups of people/cultures required to produce knowledge. Knowledge is considered something that is constructed intersubjectively and in direct relation to the physical world and power discourse in which it is used. Through case studies in material culture currently housed at the Pitt Rivers Museum, an ethnographic and anthropology institute in Oxford, UK, it is argued that mind, body and external world properties play inseparable roles in the way knowledge is produced. In addition it becomes clear that a traditional Cartesian understanding of knowledge has consistently been used in interpreting the knowledge systems of other cultures. Such projection of a traditional Cartesian understanding of knowledge on the knowledge systems of other cultures has left an often distorted view of other modes of knowing, being and understanding, and attests to the colonial conditions under which the objects examined here were acquired. Study of material objects expose the fallacy in mind-body dualism and ought to be considered the missing links regarding knowledge systems obscured as result of the universalisation of the traditional Cartesian understanding of knowledge.","['Embodied knowledge', 'Cartesian mind-body dualism', 'material culture', 'cognitive ethnography', 'mechanisms of coloniality']"

Material culture in early modern Amsterdam coffeehouses. The sociability and aesthetics of porcelain coffee ware,"Preußinger, Anna","['Gerritsen, A.T. + Berghuis, T.J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the early modern coffeehouse and its bourgeois clientele in Europe in the form of a case study on Dutch coffeehouses in Amsterdam in the 17th and 18th centuries. The chosen inquiry seeks to elucidate how a new social category – the bourgeoisie – developed over altered drinking habits, materials and the corresponding aesthetical codes within the social institution of the coffeehouse. Rather newly, the coffeehouse as an institution of publicness and consumption in the Enlightenment is researched from the angle of visual and material history. On the whole, this thesis contributes to the cultural historical field of early modern consumption. One result is that the consumer goods coffee and porcelain created a balance between rational forms of conduct and individual attitudes within the public sphere of coffeehouses. A multifarious historical approach by the means of visual and textual sources towards the early modern consumption of both coffee and porcelain considers the correspondent material qualities and suggests that porcelain from China has been remarkably suitable for the coffee ritual which entered Europe from the Middle and Near East. The thereby evolved tastes were groundbreaking for the rise of the bourgeoisie. This is demonstrated by the analysis of the design and arrangement of the vessels required for the individual and collective display of the tastes around coffee-drinking, on the basis of inventories and images. From a postcolonial perspective, the present thesis outlines which associations around the historical concept of luxury accompanied the adoption of Asian coffee and porcelain coffee ware into European consumption habits, while the world of coffee has always been represented as an oriental theme in travelogues, recipe books, medicinal treatises and fashion plates. Furthermore, the thesis describes how these ideas and values associated with coffee-drinking enabled the consolidation of the social construct of a specific regional group of the urban middleclass bourgeoisie, while locating the coffeehouse in the unique historical environment of early modern Amsterdam.","['coffee', 'coffeehouse', 'porcelain', 'public sphere', 'bourgeoisie', 'Orient', 'chinoiserie', 'turquerie', 'consumption', 'aesthetics', 'taste', 'global exchange', 'early modern', 'Enlightenment', 'luxury debate', 'food studies', 'Amsterdam', 'Netherlands']"

"Cities, culture, and change. Provincial diversity within the Roman Empire","Midde, Daan van","['Flohr, M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Roman urbanism and spectacles have been important themes within scholarship on ancient history for decades. Traditionally, research has been focused on Rome, but in recent years research into the rest of the Roman Empire has become more prominent. One central issue within modern historiography has to do with the supposed uniformity of urbanism and spectacle in the Roman world. Were these parts of ancient life similar throughout the empire, or is diversity the norm? This thesis contributes to the historiographical debate in two ways. First, it will investigate urbanism and spectacles in three Roman provinces instead of in Rome. Second, this thesis will focus on venationes, or animal hunts, because this spectacle type has not gotten much attention in existing scholarship on spectacles. By comparing different Roman provinces to one another, it will become clear that while some consistencies can be found in the urbanism, spectacle culture and venationes, they underwent profound changes due to the specific provincial contexts in which they manifested themselves. This adaptation resulted in significant urban and cultural diversity within the Roman world.","['Roman Empire, Spectacle, Venationes, Urbanization, Roman Provinces']"

This makes the period attractive to the far-right, whose members view the Middle Ages as an alternative to our modern, multicultural times. In the past, Medieval imagery and rhetoric have consequently been appropriated by groups and individuals ranging from the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazis to Anders Breivik, the Charlottesville protesters and Vladimir Putin. In this thesis, Guus van der Peet examines how the appropriation of history has taken place in the Dutch Language Area. He analyses four case studies: 1) an antisemitic sequel to the Middle Dutch classic Vanden Vos Reinarde; 2) the academic publications of Jan de Vries, a national-socialist professor in Leiden; 3) two Youtube videos from the Flemish far-right student association Schild & Vrienden; 4) two speeches by alt-right politician Thierry Baudet. In the end, Van der Peet concludes that there is a significant difference between the Flemish and Dutch appropriation of the past. Whereas the Flemish far-right repeatedly references the Middle Ages, the Dutch far-right deviates from the international tradition by instead appropriating the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.","['Far-right', 'Middle Ages', 'Reynaert', 'Baudet', 'De Vries', 'Schild & Vrienden', 'Literature', 'Populism', 'Fascism', 'Renaissance', 'Medievalism', 'Van Genechten', 'Medieval', 'Appropriation']"
In Which Pooh Hums a Good Hum: A Case Study on the Effect of Translation on Children's Verse,"Reuselaars, Esmee","['Reus, T.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The translation of children’s literature is a relatively new and upcoming field within translation studies. Within this genre, readers can find everything ranging from prose to poetry, and sometimes even the two combined. Children’s books often make use of verse, short poetic songs embedded within prose to add more colour to the oral performances of these books, which are often read aloud by adults to children. However, creating a text that is well-suited for reading aloud is quite difficult and not always translated successfully. This thesis is a case study that aims to assess the effect a translation can have on the oral performance of children’s verse in A.A. Milne’s The House at Pooh Corner by conducting interviews with adults participants performing an immediate and repeated reading of the first three verses of the books. The results showed that a translation can assuredly have a negative effect on the oral performance of a text and that there is a specific need for a consistent rhyme scheme and rhythm in children’s verse","['Children’s literature', 'Children’s verse', 'Poetry', 'Oral reading', 'Read-alouds', 'Multidimensional Fluency Scale', 'Pentathlon Principle', 'Rhyme', 'Rhythm']"
When a Warrior Meets a Knight: The Political Alliance between Al Smith and John Raskob and How It Affected the 1928 Presidential Elections,"Vis, Jesse","['Fazzi, D.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"After Al Smith became the Democratic standard-bearer at the Democratic National Convention of 1928, Raskob was entrusted with the important position of chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Having a Catholic presidential nominee was unprecedented in the white, Protestant politics of the 1920s United States, and Smith doubled down on this by granting the Catholic capitalist Raskob an influential position in the Democratic Party. This led to a storm of anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant bigotry that began raging in the Southern and Western states, once Democratic strongholds. But their Catholicism was not the only unprecedented aspect of this political team, as Smith and Raskob were both also adamantly opposed to Prohibition. Raskob even was a board member of the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment (AAPA) in 1928 and played a crucial role in affecting Smith’s views on this issue, as this thesis argues and proves. Smith and Raskob shared the belief that it was anti-Catholic bigotry and opposition to immigrant communities that had been heavily influential in creating the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the one that banned the manufacture, sale, and transportation of intoxicating liquors within the country. Their ideas proved to be correct. In fact, when the Eighteenth Amendment was enforced through the famous Volstead Act of 1920, Catholic, immigrant, African-American, and lower-class communities in urban areas were disproportionately targeted. These ethnic and religious aspects of American Prohibition helped shape and cement the alliance of Smith and Raskob and impacted both Republican and Democratic voting blocs greatly when Smith ran for president in 1928.","['United States', 'Prohibition', 'Political History', 'Alfred E.

Although research indicates possible positive consequences of the BRI, criticists believe the development initiative shows characteristics of economic and political dependence through power politics. Some even argue the BRI shows neo-colonial characteristics. However, as China is not a former European colonial power, nor a developed nation, the assumption of classical neo-colonialism is inconvenient. This research argues that China is using the BRI as a new form of neo-colonialism in the 21st century. By holding the classical interpretations of neo-colonialism in the light of the 21st century, this research developed a broader conceptualisation of modern-day neo-colonialism. By means of an operationalisation framework using four neo-colonial characteristics (import and export dominance, dominance in crucial industries, fields and companies, backwardness and debt-obligations), this research found that China in some cases used neo-colonialism as an instrument to obtain economic and political dependence over Hungary, Serbia and Poland.","['BRI', 'CEEC', 'Neo-colonialism']"
US Democracy Promotion During the Age of Trump: The Case of Latin America,"Jones, Benjamin",['Dr André Gerrits'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research looks at how the United States promotes democracy in its foreign policy, and investigates whether Trump made a difference to this policy during his presidency. It looks at the case of Latin America, how the US has promoted democracy there in the past few decades, and the foreign policy Trump adopted towards the region. This thesis argues that US foreign policy contributed to the current fragility of democracy in Latin America, by working against its governments during the previous decades and regimes to protect its interests as opposed to strengthening democracy and democratic governance in the region. Furthermore, Trump damaged the reputation of the US’ democracy promotion efforts especially by his often ani-democratic narrative and his focus on im- migration and the US border as opposed to protecting US interests in Latin America. However, the current situation in Latin America highlights a contrast between weak democratic governance and strong civil society, challenging the justification of US foreign policy of democracy promotion as its focus on stability in Latin America resulted in weak democratic governance, yet independent civil societies emerged in several states.",

Paradoxical Politics: First-Wave Feminism in The Netherlands and Dutch Colonialism in the East Indies: A qualitative analysis of the perspective of Dutch colonial women in the East Indies on colonialism and their Indonesian babu following the period of first-wave feminism,"Galjaard, Amarins",['Dr. Irene Hadiprayitno'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research aims to reconstruct the perspective of Dutch colonial women in the East Indies on their babu, the Indonesian household maid. Reconstructing this perspective sheds a light on the paradox of these women’s support for Dutch colonialism in the Indies whilst the first wave of feminism gained popularity in their home country. By using a Multi-Modal Critical Discourse Analysis this research exposes how in contexts where the babu, or any other person of Indonesian descent came in close proximity to the Dutch colonists, distance would be safeguarded in an alternative manner. As distance would be maintained at all times, the perspective of the Dutch on the Indonesian people corresponded all the more to a discourse of “Orientalism” leading to clear separations in thinking about ‘us’ and ‘them’. The feeling of superiority that served as the basis for this distancing from Indonesians was encouraged and reinforced by the governance of the Ethical Politics. Throughout the materials analysed it seems apparent that the Dutch colonial women did not escape from taking over this discourse of hierarchy. Thus, this research concludes that a feeling of superiority formed the basis of the initial distance kept from the Indonesian people. Then, out of fear of being threatened by the close proximity of Indonesians, such as the babu, a distance would be kept in alternative ways by stressing the superior position of the Dutch. This led to a vicious circle in which hierarchy was used as a tool to maintain distance. Following, this distance only strengthened the feelings of hierarchy and superiority in return, leading to even more distance and more feelings of superiority and so on. Consequentially, the treatment of the babu did not correspond to the modern definition of feminism. However, as first-wave feminism in The Netherlands was aimed at Western women only, first-wave feminists did not fail their feminist theory. Nevertheless, if the perspective of Dutch colonial women on their babu changed in the period of first-wave feminism in The Netherlands, it would have likely been for the worse.","['Feminism, Colonialism, Indonesia, Dutch East Indies']"

It tests the theoretical application of Afro-pessimism and the Westphalian filter on western (UK and US) media coverage of the Sierra Leonean and Angolan civil wars in the year 2000. Afro-pessimism refers to a frame of African representation in western media that is said to have been prevalent in the 1980s until the early 2000s. It is characterised by overwhelmingly negative reporting on the continent, where violent events throughout the continent are discussed as one “African mess,” and their causes are seen as indicative to an inherent “Africanness.” The Westphalian filter refers to a frame of African resource war reporting that focuses merely on state-level actors and ignores non-state actors who have economic stake in the conflict, rather than a political one. Both civil wars were (re-)ignited in early 1990s and diamond mining and trading played an instrumental role in financing and sustaining both wars. In the year 2000, media coverage on the wars was often more reflective and sought to explain the causes and developments of the wars. By conducting a critical discourse analysis of these reflective sources, this thesis concludes that neither frame is as dominant in western reporting on the African resource wars as their proponents claim. While features of both frames are visible in the analysis, neither can be seen as the prominent frame through which African resource wars were communicated in the year 2000. The thesis conducts exploratory research that provides a strong base for further research.",

Residential and Socio-Spatial Segregation in Global Metropolises :Lessons on Multiculturalism from Vienna and New York,"Antic, Maksim",['Dr. G.

With the rise of the European right-wing, the effects of urban segregation and multiculturalism have become more profound, making the study of multiculturalism more important than ever. Particularly, the approach of global metropolitan cities to these issues has increasingly become critical to analyze. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the benefits and limitations of diverging approaches in tackling multiculturalism, by conducting a transatlantic study comparing Vienna and New York City (NYC). Through secondary desk-based research, relevant scholarly articles, databases, governmental reports, and past interviews were analyzed, in order to understand what the two cities could draw from each other with regards to urban segregation policies. The findings show that although both New York and Vienna can be regarded as exemplary in their respective countries, Vienna’s social housing policies, alongside a lesser degree of ethnic and racial segregation, provides a positive example for New York and many more cities around the world",
“Victims” in a World of Fog: Analyzing China’s Climate Cooperation from Copenhagen to Glasgow,"Verweij, Jasmijn","['Wei, N.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Recently, more attention has been given to the important role of identity on shaping the international political behavior of states. However, within this shift of perspectives in IR, due to the ambiguity and vagueness that is associated with the concept, the influence of historical memory on state identity has been routinely ignored. The complexity of memory is acknowledged as memories are constantly reshaped and “rewritten”; the way in which memory constitutes state behavior is dynamic and non-linear, heavily depending on time-specific contexts and environments. A conceptualization of the connection between historical memory and state identity therefore requires a theory that can take account of both the internal and external. Most scholarship has agreed that the study of ontological security” can provide a thorough explanation of how memory can influence political behavior. The theory provides one with the tools to connect international and domestic contexts with a changing and dynamic usage of history, taking into account the uniqueness and multi-disciplinary nature of the concept of memory. To deconstruct irregular and complex state behavior using this model, it has been applied on a case study of Chinese political behavior within an environment of multilateralism. Thereby, an emphasis has been lain on its participation within the UNCCCs from 1992 to 2015, in which China has been seen to experience a shift in narrative in which history was used differently. Explaining the complexity of China’s behavior, this research has unveiled that China’s domestic and international contexts, has caused the CCP to be reside in a situation of ontological insecurity, which has influenced the CCP’s use of memory in formulating or contributing to formulating international climate policies. Thereby, this research has proven that a perceived weakened position of China’s resource security, thus as a high-performing economic giant , has driven them to use historical perceptions that foster cooperation rather than conflict, corresponding to a rational-choice model of avoiding conflict when resources are scarce.","['Ontological Security, Memory, political behavior, international climate conferences (UNCCCs), China']"
"The Role of Women in Socio-Economic Development in the Democratic Republic of Congo After the Second Congo War, 1998- 2003: Change and Continuity.","Wolters, Roos","['Gam, W.N']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The purpose of this study is to examine how the role of women in the socio-economic sphere has changed and/or remained the same in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) before and after the Second Congo War, which lasted from 1998 to 2003. The expansion of globalization, as well as the end of wars, has changed social structures within society and in particular created different opportunities for women in political, social and economic processes compared to before. Through the use of qualitative research, the study explores the role of women and the challenges that continue to hinder their socio-economic participation to this day. The study contends that social norms continue to hinder the role women are able to have in the DRC as the idealized femininity continues to be defined by mothering, caring and providing for the children and being subordinate. Women continue to be largely the backbone of the agricultural sector, present in the informal sector as well as the primary caregivers. But, due to the war, as well as globalization and technological development, their roles have expanded to sectors and industries such as the artisanal mining industry, the information and communications technology (ICTs) and telecommunications. Furthermore, due to there being stigmatization surrounding rape, legal barriers, education gender inequalities and lack of access to land, the role of women remains hindered and restricted. Further research is needed to understand these gender norms, relations and the role of women in the DRC as gender roles remain fluid and can change over time.","['Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)', 'gender', 'socio-economic development', 'change and continuity', '1998-2003.']"
De geschiedenis van een bloedbad: Zutphen en 1572,"Visser, Johan","['Pollmann, J.S.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,nl,"In 1572 is Zutphen het toneel van een burgeroorlog. In juni vindt de stad aansluiting bij de Opstand van Willem van Oranje en Willem van den Bergh, dankzij hulp van binnenuit. In november wordt de stad door het regeringsleger van Alva en don Fadrique heroverd en gestraft voor de opstandigheid. Volgens verhalen uit de latere herinneringscultuur vindt er dan een bloedbad onder de burgerbevolking plaats. Deze scriptie laat zien dat dit verhaal het product is van eigentijdse geruchten en propaganda, en gepolitiseerde herinneringspraktijken in de zeventiende eeuw. De lokale herinneringscultuur is een modern verschijnsel. Het aanvankelijke uitblijven van een lokale herinneringstraditie wordt verklaard door het ontbreken van belanghebbenden en de werking van vergetelheidclausules in amnestieregelingen als het Generaal Pardon (1574) en de Pacificatie van Gent (1576). Wat is er dan wel gebeurd? In werkelijkheid wordt het garnizoen Waalse huurlingen ter dood veroordeeld. Voor de Zutphenaren is 1572 (in hun woorden) vooral een 'ellendig jaar', waarbij de nadruk niet vanzelfsprekend op de gebeurtenissen in november ligt.","['Herinneringscultuur', 'Zutphen', 'propaganda', 'Willem van Oranje', 'Willem van den Bergh', 'Alva', 'don Fadrique', 'Willem Baudartius', 'burgeroorlog', 'Nederlandse Opstand', 'Tachtigjarige Oorlog', 'amnestie', 'vergetelheid', 'memory']"

De grote Europese mogendheden breidden hun overzeese imperia uit en wisten koloniale systemen op te zetten in Afrika en Azië. De kolonisatoren namen de macht in handen en drongen hun cultuur op aan de lokale bevolking, iets wat niet zelden leidde tot verzet. Ook Nederland en Duitsland, twee van de koloniale machthebbers, kregen hier op verschillende momenten mee te maken. Duitsland werd in 1904 opgeschud door een opstand van de inheemse bevolking in zijn kolonie Duits Zuidwest-Afrika (Deutsch-Südwestafrika). Nederland begon in 1873 een oorlog in Atjeh om de regio te ‘pacificeren’ en onder Nederlandse controle te brengen, wat leidde tot sterk lokaal verzet. Hoewel deze conflicten op het eerste oog misschien weinig overeenkomsten vertonen, is er toch zeker één significante gemene deler: in beide koloniale oorlogen is het geweld volledig geëscaleerd. Dit onderzoek staat in het teken van een vergelijking tussen beide. Eén type bron neemt een centrale plaats in, namelijk het militaire egodocument. Enkele militairen die vochten in een van deze conflicten hebben geschreven over hun ervaringen aldaar. Wat hadden zij te melden over de aard van het toegepaste geweld?

It argues that Nordic cooperation has played an important role in the policy areas of security and defence, and regional development. Regarding security and defence, NORDEFCO has complemented the limits of NATO in providing the Nordics with security guarantees and involving partners in the North Cap region, in order to respond to the growing Russian threat. Regarding regional development, the NCM and other Nordic venues have established an elaborate policy framework for addressing transnational issues, coordinating intra-Nordic cooperation and cooperation with other Arctic actors, and managing and implementing EU funding programmes. Through this, Nordic cooperation has fulfilled an important role in complementing and supplementing various shortcomings of EU and NATO Arctic policies. Nordic cooperation is analysed as a form of sub-regionalism, which has allowed for a nuanced, realistic understanding of the functioning of Nordic cooperation in the Arctic, in relation to the national and regional level. Through this, this thesis has contributed to strengthening the nexus between the scholarship on Nordic cooperation and sub-regionalism. The analysis consists primarily of a document analysis of the Nordic Arctic strategies and policy documents of the Nordic institutions, combined with elements of (comparative) institutional analysis and a semi-structured interview.","['Arctic, Nordic Cooperation, Sub-regionalism']"

This thesis argues that the motivation of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) to support expansion of the EU was formed by various push factors, such as Thatcher’s neoliberalism and deregulation of labour, and pull factors, like European Commission President Jacques Delors’ vision of a socially embedded capitalism to accompany economic integration. Furthermore, it argues that because of the structural dependencies between the EU’s cores and peripheries, economic integration has not favoured all workers. Disparities in social standards, national systems of industrial relations, and labour costs have been hurdles in establishing a harmonised European organisation of labour. Finally, this thesis argues that the EU’s framework of minimum labour regulations through the TFEU and Commission directives does not help to bridge the gap between the vastly divergent social standards among member states.","['Labour Studies, Enlargement, European Union, Labour market,']"

Seeing Differently: Extinction Rebellion’s Aesthetic Interventions in Global Environmental Politics,"Foster, Nina","['Smith, K.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"When Extinction Rebellion (XR) burst onto the scene of global environmental politics with a ‘Declaration of Rebellion’ in October 2018, the network’s now notorious use of nonviolent civil disobedience was not its only novel tactic: its global protests shared a distinctive approach to aesthetics and activism. The ‘hyper-aesthetic’ nature of XR’s protests, coupled with the network’s broad challenge to environmental politics, invites close consideration of what it means to engage aesthetics in an attempt to recalibrate the political response to climate change. However, International Relations has thus far paid limited attention to what aesthetic tactics of persuasion might mean for the understanding of global environmental politics or the nature of political responses to existential threats more broadly. This thesis therefore explores the aesthetic dimension of global environmental politics and XR’s place within it. Guided by aesthetic theory, self-conducted interviews with the founders of XR, and visual analysis, I argue that XR has utilised the exceptional capacity of ‘aesthetic protest’ - comprising performance, graphic design, language, installation art and more - to affect new and imaginative environmental sensibilities. This challenge - to see climate change as a unique and unprecedented threat that demands a more imaginative, urgent and emotional global political response - amounts to a challenge to the representational paradigms of contemporary global environmental politics.",

Sc., 400). This idea also appears in Athenaeus’ Deipnosophistae (book II), a work where the recitation of various texts is presented as an account of the conversation occurred during and about the symposion. The ambiguity of wine is introduced by a medical excerpt by Mnesitheus, where both positive and negative effects of wine consumption are defined, with ascending severity; relevant citations of different genres follow. The purpose of this Master thesis is to facilitate a better understanding of the ancient Greek thought on the ambivalence of wine. Hence, the citations analyzed give prominence to this ambiguity, either directly or more allusively, organized according to their place in the book and their genre (comedy, elegy and lyric poetry, tragedy). Furthermore, it aims to re-introduce Mnesitheus, a 4th-century physician and writer of medical texts, frequently neglected by research, but above all, to cast light on the way Athenaeus is organizing knowledge while composing his work, what I call his “poetics of citation”. Beyond the net of texts weaved by word-based links, connections in terms of idea and structure are also showcased. It is argued that Athenaeus’ poetics of citation consist of the introduction of an idea and its subsequent extension while steadily diverging from its original form; while Mnesitheus’ excerpt clearly defines the ambiguous nature of wine building a crescendo of the effects of its consumption, both structure and idea get progressively lost as the work progresses.","['Athenaeus', 'Deipnosophistae', 'Mnesitheus', 'symposium', 'symposion', 'wine', 'poetics of citation']"
A Feature-based Interpretation of the Behavior of /a/ in Vowel Harmony Languages,"Planting, Manon","['Botma, E. D.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"In vowel harmony, all vowels in (roughly) a word agree with one another regarding one of their features. Vowels in such languages can harmonize with regard to backness, rounding, height, and tongue root position. Vowels can be described in terms of phonological features. Some feature combinations are ‘preferable’ to others, as Archangeli and Pulleyblank (1994) argue in Grounding Theory. Based on these feature relationships, the low vowel /a/ in particular may show interesting behavior in vowel harmony. This thesis therefor examined the following research question: How can a feature-based interpretation account for the behavior of /a/ in vowel harmony languages? In order to research this, data from Tuvan (backness), Kirghiz (rounding), C’lela (height), and Maasai (tongue root position) have been used. Findings show that a feature-based interpretation can account for the behavior of /a/ in vowel harmony languages. /a/ alternates in some languages, and fails to harmonize in others. When /a/ participates in vowel harmony, it has to seek its counterpart slightly higher in the vowel triangle, as predicted by Grounding Theory. Feature relationships show that some combinations of features are preferable, and thus result in successful harmony, while others are avoided. These ‘poor’ combinations of features often result in failure to harmonize. All in all, a feature-based interpretation can account for the behavior of /a/ in vowel harmony languages. These findings suggest that the behavior of /a/ is predictable by a feature-based interpretation.","['feature relationships', '/a/', 'vowel harmony', 'Grounding Theory']"
Non Videbis Quid Videre Non Vis: On Sexual Elements in Anglo-Saxon Riddles,"Meijer, Tatum","['Porck, M.H.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"It is a widely known fact that monks practice abstinence. Yet, the monastic scribes of the Old English riddles had to copy lines about a man raising up clothing and thrusting with something stiff, about a girl gripping a swollen and boneless thing, and about something by a man’s thigh that often fully fills the same hole. Unlike these lines might suggest, these riddles do not concern any unholy acts, but merely butter churning, a girl kneading dough, and a key unlocking a door. The power of riddles lies in their ability to change a mundane act or object in something so vastly different it is hardly recognisable, which makes them both a fun and mentally stimulating challenge. In Anglo-Saxon times, riddles circulated in Old English as well as in Anglo-Latin; the two Anglo-Saxon riddling traditions. The majority of current research on riddles claims that the two traditions are very similar in every aspect, except for the presence of sexual riddles. That particular subtype of riddles is said to only occur in the Old English tradition. Although the classroom, where the Anglo-Latin riddles are generally believed to be used, does not strike as a fitting place for crude jokes, some evidence of traces of possible sexual riddling have been found by Andy Orchard and Mercedes Salvador-Bello. Exploratory studies such as theirs leave room for future research, which inspired this thesis.","['Old English', 'Anglo-Latin', 'Early Medieval Literature', 'Riddles', 'Sexuality']"

Why Could You Not Just Stay Silent?: Feminist Revisionist Mythmaking in Margaret Atwood’s The Penelopiad and Madeline Miller’s Circe,"Eikelenboom, Suzette Hannah",['Prof.dr. P.T.M.G. Liebregts'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since the twenty-first century, feminist retellings of myths have become increasingly popular. As an epic, Homer’s The Odyssey brims with female characters. However, mythology is often considered to consist of archetypal and universally applicable stories about the nature of the universe and human life, which often leads to the notion that myth is stagnant and unchangeable. As a rising genre, feminist revisionist mythmaking aims to focus on the role of women in myth. By using Hélène Cixous’ essay The Laugh of Medusa and Alicia Ostriker’s definition of feminist revisionist mythmaking, this thesis aims to illustrate how Margaret Atwood’s The Penelopiad (2005) and Madeline Miller’s Circe (2018) revise and adapt previously marginalised female characters. This thesis will give an analysis of the women in Atwood’s The Penelopiad, focussing on Penelope’s voice and reputation, female rivalry, and the unjust hanging of the maids, followed by an analysis of Miller’s Circe that focusses on Circe’s voice and personal growth, sisterhood, and female sexuality. Both The Penelopiad and Circe confront issues such as gender and justice that are present in The Odyssey as well as present-day society. By focussing on women’s presence in a literary canon that historically seen has been dominated by the male gaze, Atwood and Miller emphasize that these women have survived despite the male-focused dominance and that it is never too late for them to speak up.","['feminist revisionist mythmaking', 'classical reception studies', 'feminist studies', 'mythology', 'adaptation theory', 'the Odyssey', 'Circe', 'The Penelopiad', 'Madeline Miller', 'Margaret Atwood']"

However, as implied by the title of this thesis, not every significant character is capable of doing so for a variety of reasons. This thesis will largely concentrate on The Helper, The Villain, and The Hero; namely, Remus Lupin, Voldemort, and Harry Potter. This thesis will examine these characters’ journeys towards wholeness and will explore to what extent they are successful in completing their “quests.” By dividing this thesis into four parts, one for each character, and one for an in-depth literary examination of Jung’s theory of Individuation, this thesis will shed a light on Lupin, Voldemort, and Harry’s Shadow selves. After a comprehensive study of the seven books and an in-depth examination of these three characters, this thesis will conclude that not every character is capable of confronting their Shadow for a number of internal and external reasons. Using the characters of Remus Lupin, Tom Riddle, and Harry Potter, this study asserts that although Remus is incapable of embracing his Shadow Self and Tom is opposed to it, Harry eventually does so. Additionally, this thesis will illustrate that, much as Lily Potter’s love for Harry saved his life, it is love that enables him to embrace his whole Self; his dark and light Persona.","['harry potter', 'carl jung', 'individuation', 'process of individuation', 'remus lupin', 'voldemort', 'psychology', 'the shadow', 'shadow', ""jung's shadow"", 'archetypes', 'jungian psychology', 'fantasy', 'vladimir propp', ""the hero's journey"", 'joseph campbell', 'the hero', 'the helper', 'the villain']"

Morgan-Owens Ph.D.'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"After the 9/11 attacks, the world reacted in shock. Never before had the U.S. been attacked so close to the heart of the nation. As the dust settled, a dominant narrative took hold of the country. This narrative cast America as a victim on the geopolitical stage, and through this narrative America’s leadership committed itself to overcoming its victimhood and becoming the hero by waging a war on terror. One of the earliest symbols used in this narrative was the FDNY - these brave firemen, who had rushed into danger to help civilians as the tower collapsed, came to symbolize both the national trauma and the heroism of the U.S. Many works have been written which analyze this narrative from many different angles, with the main takeaway being that this narrative succeeded in mobilizing the population of the U.S. towards war. Due to this heavy focus on this dominant narrative and the road it paved to war, some elements have not received their due attention in academic literature. This thesis will focus on two of these elements. This thesis focuses not on the impact of this dominant narrative on geopolitics, but on the impact of these narratives on its protagonists: the “heroes” of the FDNY. This thesis traces the changes in narratives surrounding these firemen with particular attention to the presentation of masculinity and trauma in these narratives. To discuss these narratives, this paper focuses on three publications: the documentary 9/11 by the Naudet brothers, the book American Ground by William Langewiesche, and the FX TV show Rescue Me. In these cultural objects, the masculinity of the FDNY firemen is presented very similarly, but the authors situate that masculinity completely differently in a gendered power order. All three narratives also address the impact of that “situating” on the trauma suffered by firemen after 9/11. This thesis finds that each of these narratives objectifies firemen in different ways and that this objectification causes further difficulties in providing firemen with mental health support.","['trauma', 'masculinity', '9/11', 'melodrama', 'firefighters']"

"A phonological description of Yamalero, the language of ethnic Yaruro in the Colombian Eastern Plains","Ginebra, David","['Bert Botma', 'Rik van Gijn']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis consists of a phonological description of the Yamalero language, based on primary data. Yamalero is a Guahiban language spoken by some 300 people in the Colombian Eastern Plains. Some of these speakers are ethnic Yaruro, who had been reported to speak Yaruro (Pumé), but this thesis shows that none of them is able to use this language any more. Yamalero is a virtually undocumented language, since the only materials available before the publication of this phonological description were a 31 terms wordlist. This enabled the classification of Yamalero within the Cuiba-Sikuani language continuum. This thesis shows some features of the Yamalero phonology that are closer to Sikuani, such as the process of lenition of aspirated plosives, and others that are closer to Cuiba, such as the presence of consonantic codas. When appropriate, it also shows its resemblances to other genetically unrelated languages in the area, such as Saliba, Piapoco, Achagua or Puinave. This phonological description contributes to the study of Guahiban languages, on which very little research has been published in the last 20 years, as well as to the study of the languages between the Amazonia and the Andean foothills.","['Guahiban languages', 'Yamalero', 'phonology', 'language documentation', 'Amazonian languages', 'Yaruro people', 'functional linguistics']"

The expression is qí le guài le, which I tentatively translate as ‘how strange’. Double le is well-described for verb–object (VO) compounds, as in nà le mèr le ‘have been perplexed’. However, qíguài is listed in dictionaries as an adjective meaning ‘strange’ and as a verb meaning ‘to find strange’. It is not documented as a VO, raising questions about its syntactic status. In this study, I investigate what qí le guài le means, what each instance of le contributes to its meaning, and whether qí and guài should be analysed as two different syntactic elements. The second paragraph contains an overview of the methodology. Here, it is explained that I understand syntax primarily as the study of relations between meanings. This contravenes a popular view of syntax as primarily concerning relations between forms. I also make a fundamental distinction between meaning and interpretation. In the following paragraphs, the analyses are presented step by step, and any linguistic jargon is explained and illustrated with examples. The reader is not expected to have prior knowledge of either Mandarin or linguistics.","['Mandarin', 'syntax', 'semantics', 'aspect', 'valences']"

These events are part of a larger history of similar incidents like these. Over the years, social media has become more popular and with it the role it plays in social and political activism, which is what makes these recent events deviating from previous situations. Previous studies have used quantitative research methods to examine the role of social media during activism and mobilization. Alternatively, this research uses a qualitative discourse analysis to explore how social media shape spaces and opportunities for the Palestinian struggle. Based on the analysed data, retrieved from five Instagram accounts, four categories were created: information, the Palestinian identity, violence and mobilization. The content of the analysis was interpreted using knowledge gained on the history, as well as on the aftermath of social media and activism in Palestine. The categories show how social media shape spaces and opportunities for Palestinians to: share their own narrative and experiences, seek support and mobilize.","['Palestine, online activism, social media, Instagram.']"
A wildfire or a path: The influence of metaphors on perceived COVID-19 control,"Minderaa, Laura BA","['Naerssen, M.J. van']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Metaphors effectively explain a complex (scientific) topic in terms familiar to the non-expert audience. However, metaphors also affect attitude. This thesis investigated the effects that the path metaphor and the wildfire metaphor have on the personal control people experience over the further course of the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, participants received a text about the ongoing yet hidden threat of COVID-19, in which a new outbreak was either described as a wrongly taken path, as a wildfire flaring up, or without a metaphor. To measure the experienced amount of personal control, the participants were asked about their feelings of fear and control of the virus and the measures, and how they would bring these feelings into practice by reacting to multiple scenarios involving the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Statistical testing revealed no significant effect of the metaphors on the participants’ responses, potentially due to (amongst others) the time frame of the research. It is necessary to research in which circumstances a metaphor does and does not affect attitude. Then, it can be determined how and when a metaphor can best be employed in daily life to influence the hearer’s perception of a message, for example in the contexts of climate change, disease, and politics.","['Metaphor', 'Attitude', 'COVID-19', 'Personal control', 'Wildfire', 'Path']"

The Troubled Relationship Between the PLO and the Syrian Government: An analysis of how the PLO’s soft power impacted the legitimacy of the Syrian government under Hafez al-Assad,"Hussein, Tamara","['Nalbantian, T']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research attempts to shed light on the relationship between the Syrian government and the PLO during the period from 1967 until 1985. Key events between the war of 1967 and the Palestinian refugee camp wars of 1985 in Lebanon are taken as focal points of analysis for this research. The hypothesis investigated in this research is the following: The soft power of the PLO contributed to the delegitimization of the power of the Syrian government under Hafez al-Assad. To test the hypothesis a collection of primary and secondary sources is used. The primary sources include archives from the Lebanese newspaper al-Nahar and the Foreign Broadcast Information Service. For secondary sources, the research relies on authoritative literature to understand the interaction between the PLO and the Syrian government under Hafez al-Assad. The significance of this research derives partially from moving away from the dominant realist and rationalist models to explain the politics of the Arab world. Taking Joseph Nye’s notion of soft power, alternatively, enables this research to look into how other forms of power influence the behavior of these actors, and vice-versa. This research concludes that the PLO’s soft power did have a significant effect on the Syrian government’s legitimacy under Hafez al-Assad. However, this soft power has been only one factor among other factors that can be used to account for the legitimacy deficit suffered by the Syrian government. These other factors, as well as limitations of this research, are discussed towards the end of the paper.","['Syria, PLO, hard power, soft power, legitimacy']"

Strategic maneuvering in the argumentative activity type of family mealtime discussion,"Shi, Ruoyu",['H. (Henrike) Jansen'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Pragma-dialectical argumentation theory has been extensively applied to the study of institutionalized domains. Only very little scholarly attention has been paid to the informal contexts such as family mealtime discussions. Family mealtime discussions have long been an object of research in a wide range of fields because they play an important role in children’s development and socialization. So far, a systematic understanding of family mealtime argumentation within the pragma-dialectical framework is still lacking. By characterizing family mealtime discussions as a pragmadialectical argumentative activity type, this paper investigates the constraints imposed by this activity type on family members’ argumentative moves in mealtime discussion. The analysis suggests that the activity of family mealtime discussion is largely informal and not institutionalized. Therefore, it is impossible to find concrete and explicit constraints imposed by this activity type. Nevertheless, some general characteristics of this activity are identified: (1) the overarching goal of socialization of children, (2) the cultural variation in norms and values, and (3) the discrepancy in cognitive and language competency between parents and children. These characteristics of family mealtime discussions constrain family members’ argumentative moves in terms of making a choice from the topical potential, adapting to the audience demand, and exploiting the presentational devices. This study provides a systematic description and analysis of family mealtime argumentative discussions, adding to the extant literature on this topic and serving as a basis for the evaluation of argumentation in family contexts.","['Pragma-dialects, argumentative activity type, strategic maneuvering, family mealtime discussion, socialization']"

By adopting a qualitative comparative analysis between the three candidates from the highly competitive Western European and Others Group election of 2020 - Canada, Ireland and Norway – this thesis aims to increase our knowledge of the determinant factors for successful campaigns. The results suggests that proven consistency and positive political engagement and results related to the communicated priorities in the campaign message – at least in relation to those of its competitors – can play a decisive role in the outcome of contested elections. However, the thesis cannot exclude any other possible determinants nor point out any single factor that is more decisive than the others.

A 'Matter' of Difference: An Agential Realist Approach to the Problem of Difference in IR,"Alberts, Maud Ms.","['Smith, K. + Thakur, V.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Dealing with or incorporating difference continues to be an important challenge in the study of International Relations (IR). Issues of difference have often times been relegated to positivism as it relies on particular scientific assumptions, such as dualism, which make it difficult to think of difference as anything but problematic. However, paradoxically, non-core theories that propose alternative strategies towards difference run into similar problems of difference as core theories do. This study aims to demonstrate how this can be explained by a latent reliance on a Cartesian understanding of physical reality in which mind and matter are separated. Currently, non-core approaches tend to privilege mind over matter as sources from which they reflexively draw their knowledge claims. As such, they reinstate dualism rather than dismantling it so that difference remains a ‘problem’. This thesis proposes a non-positivist re-engagement with physical matter by turning to quantum physics and its possible implications for studying IR. More specifically, Karen Barad’s agential realism (2007) is introduced as both an ethico-onto- epistem-ology and as a method to create a better commonplace to discuss and learn from difference. This exploratory study will demonstrate how a return to the ‘matter’ of difference makes us attentive to how different differences get made, which might increase both the accuracy and responsibility in our theorizing practices.","['Quantum, Difference, Science']"

The implicit scholarly consensus is that Arendt had only one conception of conscience. However, I will argue that Arendt developed two distinct conceptions of conscience and that the later conception should be favoured over her earlier conception. Arendt’s first conception of conscience portrays conscience as the result of taking over societal values, which then make demands on us. However, according to her second conception conscience is not automatically active in everyone, instead conscience needs to be brought about by thinking. To make my argument in favour of Arendt’s second conception, I follow a dynamical, historical approach, according to which thinkers can change their minds. If later texts about the same subject (conscience) strongly contradict earlier texts, then we should look at which text fits better in the thinker’s overall framework. In the case of Arendt and her conception of conscience, it is her second conception of conscience which can support her banality of evil thesis and her conception of thinking. Therefore, I am concluding that Arendt’s conception of conscience as a by-product of thinking should be viewed as her most authoritative position on conscience. As a result, not everyone has a conscience, whereas everyone could have one.","['Conscience', 'Arendt']"

However, the role of non-state actors in theories of justice has remained largely unexplored. In this thesis, I focus on the role of one of those non-state actors: the multinational corporation. Since multinationals act in multiple countries, I ask what role multinationals should play within a cosmopolitan theory of justice, in which all human beings are considered to be moral equals. More specifically, I argue, that multinationals should not be allowed to determine how justice is realized, because competition forces them to be partial towards their own interest, and second, because they lack formal mechanisms of accountability. I argue that this prevents them from respecting the moral equality of individuals that is required by cosmopolitan justice. Instead, I argue that a lack of global regulation of multinationals will cause injustices in the organization of the multinational as well as in the countries in which the multinational operates. To prevent these injustices from happening, I argue that multinationals should be regulated by impartial, supranational institutions. As a policy recommendation, I suggest that regulatory attempts should focus on global fiscal reform, since current corporate tax evasion aggravates several of the corporate injustices discussed, and because tax evasion undermines the realization of cosmopolitan justice.","['Theories of justice, Cosmopolitanism, Global justice, Business Ethics.']"
The Crisis of Social Reproduction Under Capitalism: And Two Distributive Justice Theories as Possible Solutions,"Roelfsema, Mare",['B.J.E. Verbeek'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"Social reproduction involves all the work that people do to (re)make people on a daily and generational basis. It involves processes by which a social system - individually and generational – reproduces itself. Socially reproductive labor is essential for the functioning of societies, including capitalistic ones: social reproduction maintains and (re)produces the workers that are the engine of the (formal) labor market. In many analyses on globalized capitalism and the current economy, social reproduction is a completely neglected aspect. This negligence prevents us from recognizing the (structural) crisis in which social reproduction finds itself: socially reproductive labor is not acknowledged as ‘real work’ and there is no reciprocity between, on the one hand, the formal and waged labor sector and, on the other hand, the informal realm. My first aim in this research is to find a (working) definition of social reproduction and, from there, research the crisis. Moreover, I will try to answer the question on how we can solve the crisis in social reproduction by studying two different distributive justice theories: justice as fairness – a theory by John Rawls – and a Unconditional Basic Income, defended by Philippe van Parijs. I will argue that a basic income is the most promising theory of the two to (partly) solve the crisis, but that it is still insufficient as a policy tool to structurally solve the profound crisis of social reproduction under capitalism. I will conclude that social reproduction will always be undervalued - both in forms of monetary reward and social status - under both the welfare state and a radical reform to the welfare state in the form of a basic income.","['social reproduction, capitalism, crisis, distributive justice, basic income']"

Tijdens manifestaties en andere uitingen van het LHBT+ activisme uit deze periode werden zij fysiek buitengesloten of genegeerd, waardoor de kloof tussen hen en de rest van de LHBT+ gemeenschap groter werd. Dit werd ook duidelijk in de manier waarop transgender mensen ten opzichte van de rest van de LHBT+ gemeenschap door overheidsinstanties en media-outlets werden behandeld.

De bodhisattva Kannon vervult een belangrijke symboolfunctie voor deze stroming. Om bovengenoemde vraag te beantwoorden is onderzoek gedaan naar de beeldtraditie van Kannon met behulp van de Lotussoetra in combinatie met secundaire literatuur en interviews met Leiko Ikemura. De Lotussoetra is het belangrijkste geschrift van het Mahayana boeddhisme met betrekking tot Kannon. Het onderzoek heeft uitgewezen dat de Usagi Kannon in hoge mate een autonoom kunstwerk is waarin Leiko Ikemura universele principes heeft willen uitdrukken. Ze heeft dit gedaan met gebruikmaking van elementen uit de boeddhistische beeldtraditie die ze op een nieuwe manier met elkaar heeft gecombineerd. In hoeverre ze zich hierin onderscheidt van andere moderne kunstenaars die teruggrijpen op boeddhistische kunst zou nader onderzoek moeten uitwijzen.,"['Kannon, Bodhisattva, geëngageerd boeddhisme, hedendaagse kunst, Japanse beeldtraditie']"

The European Union’s involvement in cross-border cooperation: the case of the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation,"Paulissen, Ninon",['Dr. Vera Šćepanović'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"From a marginal issue to one of the main objectives of the European Union (EU) cohesion policy, cross-border cooperation (CBC) has not experienced a linear path. CBC – which raises important questions of territorial sovereignty – still struggles to find its proper expression in the European legal and institutional order, even though it has become a crucial element in the process of European integration. This is precisely why it is interesting to study a major step in its evolution, namely its institutionalization in 2006 with the creation of the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC). By granting increased authority and independence to border regions, this institutionalization has overthrown traditional territorial governance, thereby giving a renewed impetus to a ‘Europe of the Regions’. This paper delves into this sudden involvement of the EU in CBC with this new legal institutional construct – a field that until then did not seem to be within its remit – in order to understand its rationale. The analysis carried out in this document will make it possible to specify the character of this institutionalization by wondering why the European Union created the EGTC in 2006. This paper will undertake this research using process tracing and the Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) as an analytical framework. Based on official documents and semi-structured interviews, this article argues that the process of putting the EGTC on the EU agenda is primarily the result of intense struggle and lobbying by subnational actors, eager to create an appropriate and secure legal framework for the long-term development of CBC.","['European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation, cross-border cooperation, multi-level governance, European integration, policy entrepreneurs']"
The EU and Poland: discursive and legislative approaches towards LGBT rights (2007 – 2020),"Bijman, Maurits","['De Coninck, J.M.M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyzes legislative and discursive approaches of the Civic platform-led (2007 – 2015) and the PiS-led (2015 – 2020) governments while also linking those approaches to the European level. It shows that LGBT rights have become politicized at both the European and the national level in Poland. The EU both discursively and legislatively supports LGBT rights while alleging its (pro-LGBT) values that are both universal and European apparently leading it to be an example around the world. Therefore, the pro-EU governments in Poland were clearly more pro-EU. The Civic Platform-led government, as a generally pro-EU government, was hesitant to politicize LGBT rights because of its sensitiveness. However, through the years its discourse and policy towards LGBT rights became more explicit in supporting LGBT rights. On the other hand, the PiS-led government was highly critical of LGBT rights while using its opposition to LGBT rights as a tool to campaign. Its stance on LGBT rights exemplifies its ambiguous position vis-à-vis Europe; while asserting a European identity and favoring EU membership, the government rejects some the EU’s core values. Overall, this thesis argues that the politicization of LGBT rights can be both beneficial and harmful for LGBT people. The danger of politicization though, is that LGBT rights could be used to further political ends rather than being primarily concerned with the well-being of those people.","['LGBT rights', 'pro and anti-LGBT discourses', 'Poland', 'European Union', 'discourse analysis', 'sexual nationalism', 'PiS and Civic Platform']"

This is one of many literary celebrations of the Holy League victory over an Ottoman fleet in the 1571 naval battle of Lepanto. This thesis deals with the work's depiction of the Ottomans: both its more generalised depiction of the Ottomans as a people, and its depiction of a specific Ottoman character, the admiral Ali Pasha. While at first glance, the work appears to paint the Ottomans in a hostile light, some scholars have argued that it also contains scenes that are more empathetic, even sympathetic to the Ottoman 'enemy'. By considering the epic's depiction of the Ottomans in light of its classical intertexts and other contemporaneous Western European responses to the Ottoman Empire, this thesis seeks to nuance this claim. I argue that the work uses many of the tropes of contemporary anti-Ottoman rhetoric, while having less in common with more 'positive' contemporaneous Western European evaluations of the Ottoman Empire. Moreover, I aim to demonstrate that the epic's 'sympathetic' passages on the Ottomans tend to have a strong European, and particularly Spanish imperial, bias: any sympathy hinges on Ottoman characters' acceptance of, or submission to, a Spanish imperialist worldview. Finally, I will connect the epic's depiction of the Ottomans to its depiction of the Spanish 'Moriscos' - the part of the Spanish Islamic population that had been forcibly converted to Christianity. The epic links them to the Ottomans, and the recent suppressed revolt of 'Moriscos' in Granada to the battle of Lepanto, thereby presenting these people as an internal enemy of Spain. Here, the epic may show the influence of Latino's patron Deza, who played an important role in the violent repression of the revolt.","['Neo-Latin', 'epic', 'Juan Latino', 'battle of Lepanto', 'Renaissance Spain', 'Ottoman Empire']"

The methodology used is comparative philology, through a close reading analysis a comparison is made between different texts to study whether one makes use of the other as a source. Only a preliminary answer can be given to the research question. On the one hand, since the work is not purely written by Danckaert, but makes use of information given by both Herberstein and Massa without mentioning these sources, it is not reliable as a source of how a Dutchman perceived Muscovy at the beginning of the seventeenth century. On the other hand, if you purely look at the ratio between chapters that are demonstrably copied and those that seem to be purely written by Danckaert, one could conclude that this work written by Danckaert is fairly reliable to see how the Dutch perceived the Russian people at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The negative image of the Russians that is conveyed in this work influences the way the Dutch perceive them, who at that time did not have many different sources on which they could base their opinion.","['Russia', 'the Netherlands', 'Muscovy', 'Linguistics', 'Comparative Philology', 'Jan Danckaert', 'Sigismund von Herberstein', 'Isaac Massa', 'Conrad Bussow', 'Petrus Petrejus']"

In the colony, they had a distinct place in society, although the community was widely diverse in economic and social status as well as the way in which they ethnically defined themselves. After the Second World War and subsequent Indonesian independence, many Indo-Dutch people relocated to the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, other countries. In this postcolonial society, Indo-Dutch people were forced to renegotiate their social identity. This happened not only in correspondence with their receiving societies but also within the context of the diaspora and Indo-Dutch community life. It is precisely the implications of the latter that this thesis aims to explore through an intersectional lens, focusing mainly on notions of gender, race, and class. It draws on interviews with eleven Indo-Dutch people, as well as newspaper articles from the magazine Tong Tong and other primary source materials. It was found that there is a wide array of self-identifications and perceived identities of Indo-Dutch people, further enhanced by the in-group power dynamics brought about by gender, class, and (perceived) racial differences. Because of this, certain individuals were not only forced to renegotiate their social identities in the context of the receiving societies but were further marginalized within the context of the diaspora. Further, it was found that it was this variety of identities as well as these (internal) power dynamics that made it difficult to create and cultivate a unified Indo-Dutch (diasporic) identity.","['diaspora', 'Indo-Dutch', 'intersectionality', 'social identity', 'identity']"

The Implementation of Solar and Wind Energy in Denmark and the Netherlands on the Path Towards the EU's 2050 Climate Neutrality Goal,"Gesemann, Jannis","['Dr. Aad Correljé', 'Dr. Vera Scepanovic']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"As a political, economic, and social power in the world, the European Union (EU) plays a decisive role in the global transition to an energy system fully based on renewable energies. However, despite the EU's commitments and current ambitions on the path towards its overarching and long-term goal of climate neutrality by 2050, its efforts in renewable energy deployment, in particular solar and wind energy, remain insufficient. Moreover, its member states continue to show largely diverging progress in this process, even rather similar states such as Denmark and the Netherlands. More specifically, while the former is widely considered as a forerunner in the energy transition, the latter continues to lag far behind compared to most other EU member states. Against this background, this study analyzed which barriers and drivers impede or facilitate the implementation of solar and wind energy in the two countries, determined the decisive factors for their differences in progress, as well as examined how existing challenges can be overcome in order to accelerate this process in the future. To this end, relevant stakeholders of both countries were questioned by the use of a qualitative questionnaire, whose responses were then analyzed in a qualitative content analysis. The results demonstrate that although similar barriers and drivers currently influence the deployment of solar and wind energy in Denmark and the Netherlands, three factors account for their differences, including the different extent of the political focus, the diverging degree and quality of coordination, as well as the different scale of public resistance. Nevertheless, as greater efforts are required by both countries, for the purpose of overcoming existing challenges in order to accelerate the deployment of solar and wind energy in the future, each of them is generally recommended to increase the political focus, to improve coordination, and to strengthen public support. Moreover, they are advised to especially tackle the identified four main barriers, including the slow and complex procedures, in particular with regard to the permitting of solar and wind energy projects, public opposition, the lack of skilled workforce, and current system constraints due to insufficient grid capacity. In the face of climate change, rising energy demand, and increasing geopolitical conflicts, including war on the continent of Europe, this would not only enable the two countries to achieve and even exceed current ambitions, but would also allow the EU to take the path towards a more sustainable, secure, and peaceful future.",

It does so by building a broad theoretical framework based on different perspectives within IR, applied to the EU-Africa relationship. The framework consists of neorealism, neoliberal, constructivist perspectives, as well as the literature on Market Power Europe. Joint policy documents by the European Union and the African Union, as well as statements and speeches by top-level EU officials constitute the means by which these policymaking changes can be captured. Any captured change or shift in the perspective and motivation of policymakers could then be situated within the theoretical framework provided. It was found that there had indeed been a shift in policymaking perspective over the stated period, from a more basic neoliberal understanding of international relations and particularly cooperation and development, to a more robust normative and assertive geopolitical and cooperative stance. It is likely that these policy shifts were informed at least in part by the changes global and geopolitical landscape. This paper affirms the continued importance of the EU-Africa relationship, not just to the EU or Africa, but to the world as a whole.","['EU', 'Africa', 'Europe as a power', 'Policymaking', 'International Relations']"

U.S. Human Rights Discourses on North Korea: The Liberal Subjects of Western Human Rights and the Post-humanitarian Distance,"Kim, Hosoo",['Christopher Green'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"What are different ideas, perceptions, or historical processes that are involved in North Korean human rights discourses produced by U.S. organizations? Is there a certain reason why American organizations express particular interest in the ‘human rights’ of North Korea? Based on a historical analysis of Western human rights and its recent development towards a form of post-humanitarianism, this thesis analyzes how the ideas of both conservative evangelicals and liberal democrats coincide to frame North Korean human rights discourses in ways that are agreeable to Western audiences. Although the organizations come from opposite stances in domestic politics, the commonalities underlying both stances are expected to reflect deep-rooted national identities that developed throughout the history of the American human rights regime. The thesis claims that a historical entanglement between decolonization, Cold War tensions, foreign policy strategies, and deeply ingrained national identities create an ‘American’ version of human rights. Moreover, although the evangelicals and the democrats differ on the extent or way of identifying the distance between ‘us the observers’ and ‘them the sufferers’, both sectors presume a selective and self-serving post-humanitarian distance that does not contemplate the structural circumstances of the sufferers. Instead, the organizations reflect on the observer’s own sense of morality, either religious duties or international security concerns, at the expense of morally essentializing or victimizing the sufferers based on Western liberal assumptions about human nature. Without trying to discount the importance of religion or security issues in U.S. international relations, this thesis aims to raise the awareness of deeply embedded power relations, both historically inherent and currently reenacted by human rights discourses, that can be easily mystified in the name of ‘universal human rights’.","['human rights', 'human rights discourses', 'decolonization', 'North Korea', 'U.S. human rights', 'post-humanitarianism']"

Reparatory Justice in the 21st Century: A Critique Examination of the Germany-Namibia Case,"Frangetto, Jessica","['Black, L. O.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Discussions about reparatory justice are important in world politics and have gained traction in the last years. The case of Germany and Namibia reverberated in the media in 2021 after the German government decided to create a compensation fund to make amends for colonialism. The ensuing agreement commits approximately one billion euros in development aid to Namibia over a 30-year period for a set of projects and a national reconciliation initiative. Henning Melber, one prominent scholar in this field, disputes this agreement. He criticizes both governments since representatives of the victims’ descendants did not participate in meetings and had no part in the decision whatsoever. However, Melber does not explain why the German government acted in the way it did, and when it did. There are many arguments that might explain it, but what this research shows is that the turning point was the rising interest of South West African People’s Organization (SWAPO) in a quick deal. When Namibia’s ruling party realized it was losing popularity and control over a national economic crisis, it decided to put an end to the discussion by signing the compensation agreement.","['reparatory justice, Germany, Namibia, development aid, colonialism, SWAPO']"

Malta and its Southern Neighbours: Small State Europeanisation in the context of the ENP,"Faber, Patrik","['Broad, M.', 'David, M.E.L.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Few policy areas are as closely guarded by the member states of the European Union as their foreign policy. This is visible on the EU-level, in the Common Foreign and Security Policy and its individual policies, as the CFSP is considered to be a salient example of intergovernmentalism’s hold on aspects of EU policy-making. However, there have been some examples of small states influencing EU foreign policy. Malta is a relevant object for this study, as it is undoubtedly a small state. This makes it an interesting case study, as it, nonetheless, has clearly defined interests in the Southern neighbourhood. The Southern neighbourhood aspect of the ENP has itself been an under researched area in recent years, as it is widely considered a failed policy, and the interest of EU-scholars has largely shifted away from the Southern neighbourhood to the Eastern neighbourhood, where the threats to the EU, and its influence on the ‘ring of friends’ it aims to create, seem more pressing. Has Malta, despite its status as a small state, and the current general disinterest in the Southern neighbourhood, managed to capture EU policy-makers’ attention and successfully Europeanised its domestic foreign policy preferences? Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis, which traces frames and discursive constructions across the domestic level, to the European level, before concluding with a comparative analysis of two EU foreign policy documents, this study demonstrates that Maltese policy preferences were uploaded to the level of EU foreign policy, more specifically, the ENP's Southern Neighbourhood component.","['Europeanisation', 'Small State', 'Discourse Analysis', 'ENP', 'Malta', 'Mixed Method', 'Content Analysis']"
Foreign Aid as a Tool for Sustainable Development? An Assessment of UK's Foreign Aid for the Promotion of Sustainable Development in Ethiopia,"Foaden, Eilis","['Regilme, S.S.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines United Kingdom foreign aid to Ethiopia between 2015 and 2020 and the extent to which it promotes environmentally sustainable development. Ethiopia is a country sensitive to environmental degradation. Climate change, biodiversity loss, and land degradation are amongst the top three environmental threats to Ethiopia. The Ethiopian Government has been able to achieve substantial economic growth, making Ethiopia the fastest growing economy in Africa. Nonetheless, the country remains economically poor and lacks the financial resources to achieve sustainable growth. Over the last decades, Ethiopia has been amongst the top-three recipient countries of UK foreign aid. Aid towards the climate is done through three departments – FCDO, BEIS, and DEFRA – who together fund the International Climate Finance (ICF). This research is qualitative and analyses projects financed through UK official development assistance (ODA) that concern climate change, biodiversity loss and land degradation. It finds that UK ODA has made significant contributions towards climate change adaptation measures in Ethiopia, such as cooperating with smallholder farmers to increase crop productivity and building resilience to climate change. Moreover, UK ODA has been successful in addressing underlying, indirect causes of biodiversity loss and land degradation (deforestation). In this sense, UK ODA has been partially successful in promoting environmentally sustainable development in Ethiopia, but more can be done to increase its impact – on a more systemic level as well as more long-term impact.",

In dit kunstwerk heeft Tam het Amerikaanse concept van de cowboy gebruikt, maar kijkt tegelijkertijd ook naar de Chinese arbeidersstaking uit 1867 in Amerika, waarbij Chinese spoorwegarbeiders betere werkomstandigheden eisten. Naast een video, heeft Tam ook dans en performance art gebruikt. Om de representatie van masculiniteit te onderzoeken, is gekeken naar de representatie van cowboys in westerns, en naar het belang van gender performativity. Hieruit is gebleken dat de cowboys in Silent Spikes juist het tegenovergestelde gedrag vertonen van de oorspronkelijke cowboys, en dat gender performativity een grote rol speelt in het interpreteren van hun gedrag. Vervolgens is het gebruik van videokunst en performance geanalyseerd om te onderzoeken hoe Tam de spoorwegarbeider zichtbaar heeft gemaakt en juist de masculiene eigenschappen aan de spoorwegarbeider toeschrijft in plaats van aan de cowboy.","['Cowboy', 'identiteit', 'masculiniteit', 'performance', 'videokunst.']"

Development Within the Chaosmos: a Deleuzian Approach to Pedagogy,"Winkelhorst, Sharron",['Dr. Frank Chouraqui'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This thesis critiques the notion of development based on a philosophy of Being. Development, and learning, can only occur within Becoming. Inspired by Nietzsche and Deleuze’s project of overthrowing Platonism, it is shown that transcendental principles explain the conditioning of reason, not its generation. To explain the process of genesis (of reason) we have to understand the principles that make order out of the chaos of life. My main hypothesis is that development is a process of the embodiment of differences, as a process of becoming. And learning is the process of encountering and internalising differences through involuntary memory and pure thought. Conditioning, on the contrary, is a process that reduces development and thought to functions in service of a final state, an Ideal, and therefore obstructs development. The process of development is a process of individuation where essences of becoming, grounded on an eternal return of difference, become internalised and increase someone’s power to resonate with the World. The production of a subject, however, is problematic because it is the result of conditioning, the internalisation of general identities (the symbolic order) in reaction to overpowering negative tensions. Development has its spiritual equivalent in learning and pure thought. Conditioning stops thought, it allows access to a desired feeling against the condition that someone accepts a certain state, or fact, without question. Because of this, conditioning always produces the unfortunate side-effect of anxiety, since the assumed truths lack any grounding in univocity.","['Gilles Deleuze', 'Friedrich Nietzsche', 'Difference', 'Embodiment', 'Simulacra', 'Will to Power', 'Eternal return', 'affective resonance', 'Chaosmos', 'Eschatology', 'Development', 'Conditioning', 'Apprenticeship', 'Signs', 'Becoming']"

Justified by being at war against internal subversives, thousands of people were abducted, tortured, and killed. They became known as the desaparecidos, the disappeared. What motivated the violence? This research identified two possible explanations. Firstly, the violence can be the consequence of an ideologically motivated counterinsurgency strategy with the aim to eradicate all individuals linked to communism. Secondly, the violence can be a tool for the dictator to increase his personal power and undermine rivals within the inner circle. It is found here that the Argentinian military was conducting an ideological counterinsurgency. In contrast, the violence in Chile can to a large degree be connected to the personal ambitions of its dictator Augusto Pinochet. By controlling the violent institution executing the violence, he was able to undermine rivals in the military junta and remain in power.","['military dictatorships, state violence, disappearances, ideology']"

Liberal democracies ought to introduce automatic citizenship for long-term resident immigrants instead. I advance a two-fold argument for this claim. My first argument states that democratic principles require incorporating resident immigrants within a democratic demos. The second argument is an argument for status equality, stating that all members of a demos must have equal status as citizens. It follows that resident immigrants must be citizens. As justice requires that all long-term residents are indeed citizens, naturalization should be mandatory for them. Finally, I criticize exclusive understandings of political community as a social or national community and suggest conceptualizing political community as a “community of place” (Bell 2020) instead.",

Atheist Christianity: Žižek and The Grand Inquisitor,"Ruinard, Floris","['Jonge, J.E. de']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Filosofie (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Legend of The Grand Inquisitor, as featured in Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s novel The Brothers Karamazov, certainly requires little introduction. As a universally acclaimed piece of literature it has served as a source of inspiration for a wide array of different fields including philosophy, politics, literature, theology and art. Amongst the peculiarities that this Legend holds, we find that the head of the Spanish Inquisition, ‘The Grand Inquisitor’, is himself accused of being an atheist. In this ironic accusation, however, may just lie the expression of a defining feature of Christianity itself, as Slavoj Žižek would argue. With his unorthodox thesis that true atheist freedom is reached only through the process of Christianity, Žižek makes a point that seems to relate to Dostoyevsky’s legendary passage. Through a close analysis of several key points in The Grand Inquisitor, the manner in which the passage implies an intertwinement between Christianity and atheism is explored. In connecting this inquiry with Žižek’s theory of ‘Atheist Christianity’, a case is made for the idea that atheism and Christianity are interdependent and in the most radical sense even equivalent. This cross-analysis leads towards the issue of defining a secular form of faith, while at the same time opening up the way for questions regarding the aptness of Žižek’s Atheist-Christian framework in understanding the social issues brought to light in Dostoyevsky’s intriguing passage.","['Christianity', 'Atheism', 'Atheist Christianity', 'The Grand Inquisitor', 'Dostoevsky', 'Zizek', 'Hegel', 'Lacan']"

The role of the press in the Ancien Régime can reveal developing political, social, and diplomatic cultures. The rigid censorship policy of the French monarchy places the newspapers in a middle ground between the government and the literate portion of the population. There were competing notions amongst the most popular European publications as to what constituted news and how it should be communicated, thus the coverage of the American Revolutionary War varied across geographical and temporal boundaries. This thesis seeks to assess the social and political upheaval that was the American Revolution in 1775, and its impact on France, through the lens of governmental control of newspapers. France’s role in the American Revolution has been well documented, as the monarchy utilised this opportunity to gain prestige and damage Britain’s standing as a global power. France officially sent military and financial aid to the rebels from 1778, and many French soldiers such as the Marquis de Lafayette became heroes who fought alongside their American counterparts to overthrow the control of King George III in the colonies. However, getting France to agree to this was difficult. It was therefore necessary for the Americans to send diplomats to Versailles to vouch for their cause and elicit support. Thus ensued a major propaganda campaign which would entangle both state and non-state actors, and would have significant implications for the development of press culture in France. France heavily censored newspapers and imposed strict regulations on the influx of foreign information from countries with a freer press environment, such as the Netherlands. In Britain, the licensing act lapsed in 1695, and provincial and national newspapers consequently multiplied in number and prospered. After the British government allowed the publication of parliamentary reports in 1772, French-language newspapers were able to reprint them, leading to increased scrutiny on their response to events in the colonies. This meant that readers of foreign French-language newspapers illegally circulating in France at the time were being exposed to alternative sources of news. The national newspapers largely reflected and upheld elite values that were ingrained into French society at the time, and left little room for debate or opposition. However, this was radically altered by the presence of the American diplomats in Paris. Leading figures, such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, were greatly admired by the French public, and they utilised this wave of popularity to bolster their political agenda. This agenda had undoubtedly been influenced by French Enlightenment thought - particularly regarding the individual rights of man, political representation, and freedom of speech and the press. This thesis explores how this philosophical and political transfer influenced the French government’s approach to the medium of the press. It identifies four main newspapers as indicators of how the war was impacting the way in which the government wanted to portray itself on the diplomatic stage. The American Revolution showed the world how it was possible to uproot a system of political injustice and to justify it using fundamental ideas of democracy. The use of the French-language press by the Americans and the French government to further their interests, therefore, exposed a reading audience to political ideas that might have otherwise been suppressed. It is in this context that the newspapers take on significance. The attempted control of the content of these papers through the manipulation of texts, propaganda and the production of war narrative that favoured French and American interests shaped how French readers came to view the conduct of their government in a way not previously seen. Furthermore, the personal relationships formed between government figures, American political leaders and philosophers, and the editors of highly influential and widely-read papers sheds light on the deep entanglement of the press with politics. While the limitations of readership in Ancien Régime France are taken into account, this thesis argues that the French involvement in the American Revolutionary War shaped French government relations with the press, and contributed to a shaping of its diplomatic engagements with America both during and after the war.","['American Revolution', 'Diplomacy', 'France', 'Propaganda', 'Newspapers', 'Censorship']"

An Unexceptional Presidency: A critical analysis of Trump's foreign policy discourse,"Snijders, Pascal","['Scott-Smith, G.P.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Donald Trump has frequently been labelled an idiosyncratic aberration and has equally been accused of breaking with American foreign policy tradition. However, by applying the foreign policy traditions uncovered by Mead (Wilsonianism, Hamiltonianism, Jeffersonianism and Jacksonianism), scholars began arguing that Trump was perfectly traditional because he adhered to one or more of these historic traditions. Simultaneously, scholars argued that Trump rejected the myth of American exceptionalism that informs said traditions. This begs the question of how one can be traditional, yet also reject their foundational myth. Scholars had failed to consider these two facets in tandem, and had only focussed on Trump’s campaign and early presidency therefore failing to provide a prudent analysis of Trump’s entire foreign policy. This thesis aimed to rectified both by asking the following question: how has Trump’s re-interpretation of American exceptionalism influenced the utilisation of the dominant traditions in American foreign policy in his foreign policy discourse? Through the use of a critical geopolitical analysis, it was uncovered that Trump redefined American exceptionalism to an conditional state of objective greatness that only he could achieve and maintain, rather than an inherent trait. This allowed him to argue that his predecessors had made America unexceptional, stirring feelings of betrayal that he could then mobilise for his own political gain. This demagogic ‘exceptional me 2.0’ strategy shaped his application of all the four traditions wherein he blames Wilsonianism for American decline and aims to rally disappointed Hamiltonians, Jeffersonians and Jacksonians against them in order to effectuate a great reset of American foreign policy and domestic politics.","['Trump', 'Donald Trump', 'United States', 'America', 'American Exceptionalism', 'Wilsonianism', 'Wilsonian', 'Hamiltonianism', 'Hamiltonian', 'Jeffersonianism', 'Jeffersonian', 'Jacksonianism', 'Jacksonian', 'Foreign Policy', 'Foreign Policy Traditions', 'Identity', 'Discourse', 'Critical Discourse Analysis', 'Critical Geopolitics', 'Walter Russel Mead']"

In de westerse wereld wordt muziek vandaag de dag voor veel mensen gebruikt als een goed dat geconsumeerd wordt. Het wordt gebruikt ter ontspanning, om op te dansen of als sfeermaker in velerlei situaties. Hiernaast is er ook een grote groep die als hobby zelf een instrument bespeeld, zingt of tegenwoordig produceert met een computer. De groep die daadwerkelijk zijn brood verdient met het maken van muziek is relatief klein. Dat laatste, geld verdienen, staat tegenwoordig in onze kapitalistische maatschappij centraal. De economie speelt een bijzondere rol in in onze maatschappij, waarin het enerzijds de fundering is die het mogelijk maakt de samenleving te laten functioneren zoals die doet en anderzijds het zorgenkind is dat constant gemonitord en ondersteund wordt om zo goed mogelijk verzekerd te zijn van de levensvatbaarheid ervan. De Nederlandse economie draait voor een belangrijk deel op onze sterke kenniseconomie. Nederland is hier wereldwijd gezien goed in en daar zijn we trots op. Om die economie te kunnen blijven voorzien van voldoende grondstoffen investeert Nederland vooral in de productiefactor kennis om het aanbod op peil te houden. De overheid ziet het als hun taak om de Nederlandse jeugd te voorzien van goed en passend onderwijs dat bijdraagt aan de ontwikkeling en groei van die kenniseconomie. Beleidsmakers en onderwijskundigen houden zich bezig met de vraag hoe het onderwijs kan voorzien in hetgeen waar vraag naar is in de samenleving. Omdat Nederland de afgelopen decennia die toppositie op de wereldwijde kenniseconomie heeft genesteld is de vraag naar kennis enorm gegroeid. De samenleving moet daarom zo veel en zo hoog mogelijk opgeleid worden. Het zwaartepunt van het basisonderwijs ligt daarom op de vakken die direct bijdragen aan het ontwikkelen de academische vaardigheden; lezen, schrijven, talen en rekenen. In dit licht gezien is het opmerkelijk dat muziek in Nederland een verplicht onderdeel is het onderwijscurriculum. Waarom zou een school kostbare tijd aan muziekles moeten verspillen wanneer het landelijke taal- en rekenniveau achteruitgaat?","['Muziekonderwijs, Willem Gehrels,']"

This revival has manifested itself no more so than in music, where numerous Ukrainian artists have used traditional instruments and ethnic motifs in combination with broader, “western” styles of popular music. In this thesis I will argue that the motivation behind this music revival - and by extension the wider cultural revival in general - is a restorative nostalgia for a free, flourishing, democratic, western-oriented, independent Ukraine that is entirely separate from Russia. After noting the stark similarities between music revivalism and restorative nostalgia, I will answer how more deeply held restorative nostalgic sentiments manifest themselves in Ukrainian revivalist music, and investigate why these sentiments manifest themselves in the way that they do. I will argue that contemporary Ukrainian revivalist popular music is instrumentalising the past in present-day culture in order to “create a future”. I term this process “signposting” insofar that signposts create a future for those who follow them, promising where they will eventually end up should they choose that path. Given Russia’s renewed, full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24th February 2022, this topic is particularly current, and will demonstrate Ukrainian culture’s tenacity, ingenuity, adaptability and resilience in the face of Russian military and cultural aggression. While the discussions in this thesis predominantly focus on cultural artefacts from between 2014 and 2021, all evidence is pointing to another Ukrainian cultural revival borne out of the events of 2022 that will make the revival of the past decade seem fairly timid by comparison. To this end, I include an afterword looking at Ukrainian music during the latest chapter of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.","['Ukraine', 'restorative nostalgia', 'music revivalism', 'culture', 'popular music', 'Eurovision']"

Dit onderwerp zal in drie hoofdstukken behandeld worden. In hoofdstuk 1 ligt de focus op wat politieke corruptie precies inhoudt, wat overheden kunnen doen om hun transparantie te verhogen en welke rol de civiele maatschappij en internationale organisaties hierin spelen. In hoofdstuk 2 wordt aandacht besteed aan de geschiedenis van Mexico, met als focuspunt politieke corruptie. Er worden drie tijdsperiodes behandeld: de Mexicaanse revolutie (1910-1917) en de PRI-heerschappij (1929-2000) die hierop volgde, het neoliberalisme en privatisering in Mexico (1982-2006) en de war on drugs van president Felipe Calderón (2006-2012). Het laatste hoofdstuk gaat in op twee initiatieven uit de civiele maatschappij. Het eerste initiatief is van de organisatie Mexicanos Contra la Corrupción y la Impunidad. Er wordt geanalyseerd op welke manieren zij zich inzetten om politieke corruptie te bestrijden en welke successen zij behaald hebben. De tweede casus behandelt de journaliste Carmen Aristegui. Er wordt uiteengezet hoe zij al jarenlang de strijd aangaat tegen politieke corruptie, en met welke obstakels zij te maken heeft. Als laatste wordt besproken hoe de huidige president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) zich inzet om politieke corruptie te bestrijden, en wat hij vindt van organisaties en journalisten uit de civiele maatschappij die dit probleem ook proberen aan te pakken.","['Mexico', 'Politieke corruptie', 'Civiele maatschappij', 'Mexicanos Contra la Corrupción y la Impunidad', 'Carmen Aristegui', 'AMLO']"

Sterker nog, met de opkomst van de sociale media is er altijd wel de gelegenheid een spottende noot toe te voegen. Dit heeft een rol die groter is dan enkel stemmingmakerij: spot kan een sterk regulerende functie hebben en is bij uitstek een uitingsvorm van sociale controle. Als een bepaalde visie of eigenschap belachelijk wordt gemaakt, draagt men die visie of eigenschap niet graag uit in de publieke sfeer en worden er sociaal-culturele grenzen gecreëerd. Dit geldt ook voor de wereld van het oude Israël. Deze scriptie schept duidelijkheid over de rol van spot bij een centraal thema in de Hebreeuwse Bijbel, namelijk de strijd tussen Ba‘al en YHWH. Grote delen van het Oude Testament hebben te maken met de verhoudingen tussen de God van Israël en deze Ba‘al, die een belangrijke concurrent blijft tot het einde van de monarchie. Waar veel onderzoek is gedaan naar de toedracht, ontwikkeling en historiciteit van deze religieuze strijd, is er relatief minder aandacht besteed aan de rol van spot in de afwijzing van Ba‘al door de Yahwistische elite. Deze scriptie benadert literaire elementen uit de Hebreeuwse Bijbel niet enkel als historiografische documenten, maar vooral als literaire composities die gebruikt worden als een wapen in deze culturele strijd. Zo wordt de volgende vraag beantwoord: Op welke manieren wordt er in de Hebreeuwse Bijbel gebruik gemaakt van literaire spot met Ba‘al, en welke rol speelt die spot binnen de religieuze strijd tussen YHWH en Ba‘al?","['Old Testament', 'Hebrew', 'Ugaritic', ""Ba'al"", 'Judaism', 'Ancient Israel', 'Ridicule']"

The question is to what extent they are making progress here and what obstacles they will encounter. In my thesis, I look at the cases of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates from a political economy lens on how they deal with the energy transition in their country. The research question I formulated: Why are Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates failing to meet the renewable energy expectations created after the Paris Climate Agreement in the period 2015-2019? In my thesis, I first describe the current state of the literature on the energy transition in these countries. I predict the bureaucracy, the undesirability for the political elite of these countries and the energy subsidies for fossil fuels that are pushing renewable sources away from the energy market. Then, based on the available data and literature, I will actually look at the goals set and the results achieved in the field of renewable energy. Then I will discuss the concrete political and economic obstacles that have been created for the aforementioned countries to shape the energy transition. Ultimately, I conclude that the targets set are unclear from mainly Saudi Arabia and Qatar, but that the United Arab Emirates has set a clear target and can perceive that they are also the only country that has set significant targets in the period 2015 – 2019 . There are also clear political and economic obstacles shaping the energy transition in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. My hypothesis that there are mainly political and economic obstacles is therefore confirmed in my conclusion. At the end I recommended further research about the development in these countries the coming period.",['energy transition middle east political economy saudi arabia qatar uae']

Twitch the Rise: An Exploration of the Online Live Streaming Subculture Through Register Analysis,"Best, Daniël","['Foster, A.A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this thesis, the subculture of online live streaming is explored on the platform Twitch by using a register analysis and Hoffman’s adaptation of usage-based Construction Grammar analysis. Research on language use has increasingly focused on communication via electronic means by conducting register, and genre analyses as more sophisticated registers emerge with rich contextual linguistic and non-linguistic features, such as the general register of email messages and Twitter tweets. This work expands on these general registers by examining one of the most prominent and fast-growing platforms in the online live streaming space, Twitch (Biber et al., 2019, p. 175; Sjöblom, 2019, p. 20). This fast growth can mainly be attributed to the immense growth in the online space. As of 2022, almost 5.3 billion people worldwide utilize the internet; this amounts to about 66.2% of the entire world population (“Internet World Stats,” n.d.). In particular, the thesis will utilize a combination of register analysis with Hoffman’s usage-based Construction Grammar analysis to depict how complex the register of Twitch is and explore how interaction occurs between parties on the platform within its register and is supported by a collision of audiovisual elements and computer-mediated communication (Biber et al., 2019, p. 174; Sjöblom, 2019, p. 20). It will present the results of 107 hours of observation watching Twitch chats between January 2022 and April 2022. Intending not only to shed light on the, as it will be referred to henceforth, Twitch register but also to show how the complex social and physical context factors shape the register through its users and, in turn, enhance the social cement present on the platform and within its communities.","['Twitch', 'interpersonal electronic communication', 'register', 'usage-based Construction Grammar analysis', 'computer-mediated communication', 'social cement']"

Copen met trauma: hoe gaan Nederlandse correspondenten in een veranderende redactiecultuur om met schokkende gebeurtenissen?,"Gruijter, Wies de","['Vanderveen, G.N.G.', 'Burger, J.P.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De laatste jaren vormt zich een steeds duidelijker beeld van het trauma dat blootstelling aan schokkende gebeurtenissen tijdens journalistiek werk in conflictgebieden teweeg kan brengen. Of een individu psychopathologie ontwikkelt, is onder meer afhankelijk van de copingstrategie die hij of zij gebruikt. De set copingstrategieën die een een journalist gebruikt, wordt beïnvloed door de journalistieke cultuur en de attitude jegens mentale problematiek die daarbinnen heerst. Dit onderzoek beoogt antwoord te geven op de onderzoeksvraag: Hoe gaan Nederlandse correspondenten in de huidige journalistieke cultuur om met de potentieel traumatische gebeurtenissen waar zij tijdens het uitoefenen van journalistiek werk mee te maken kregen? Data voor dit onderzoek kwamen voort uit semigestructureerde interviews met Nederlandse correspondenten (n = 13). De interviewtranscripten werden aan de hand van thematische en narratieve analyse geanalyseerd. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat Nederlandse correspondenten zowel adaptieve als maladaptieve copingstrategieën gebruiken en die zowel expliciet als impliciet uiten. Ondanks de toenemende bespreekbaarheid en steun van redacties omtrent mentaal welzijn, houdt het gros van de corrrespondenten onbewust nog vast aan het beeld van de onverschrokken, ongenaakbare correspondent. Hoewel de toegenomen steun van chefs en de bespreekbaarheid op redacties door de meeste correspondenten gewaardeerd wordt, is er behoefte aan een actiever terugkoppelingssysteem. Ook kan winst behaald worden in preventie: correspondenten behoeden voor mentale problematiek is nog nauwelijks aan de orde, maar zou hen, en daarmee de kwaliteit van de journalistiek ten goede komen.","['Copingstrategieën, trauma, redactiecultuur, correspondenten, betekenisgeving, mentaal welzijn']"
Changing typesetting and printing conventions in the eighteenth century: A study into the typographical features of late eighteenth-century newspapers written in French,"Rörsch, Mirjam","['Dlabačová, A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Newspapers are published fast and often, even in the eighteenth century. Setting type by hand is a rather extensive process. Do we see traces of this complicated process in newspapers? And who decides on the layout and typographical features of newspapers? Did typesetters copy typesetting habits from each other? Is it possible to see right away where a newspaper has been printed or do they all look similar? To find out more about printing processes and newspapers layouts during the late eighteenth century five French newspapers from three different countries were analyzed: the Gazette de Leyde, the Gazette d’Amsterdam, the Gazette de Nice, the Courrier d’Avignon and the Gazette de Berne. First, the historical background for all three countries and all five newspapers was researched, which is presented in chapter two and the first half of chapter three, before the printing practices in the Netherlands are introduced in the second half of chapter three. By looking more extensively at the manual written by David Wardenaar, Beschrijving der boekdrukkunst [Description of book printing], the process of printing newspapers became clearer. In chapter four the analysis of the five newspapers can be found, which helped distinguish whether there were typographical features that could be found in all five newspapers and whether the newspapers followed certain ‘trends’ or habits of other newspapers which they adopted.","['typography', 'eighteenth century', 'newspapers', 'typographical feautures']"
Holy shit or Oh my God: Female and male swearing practices in “Wie is de Mol?” as a way of identity construction,"Eersel, Karlijn van","['Grijzenhout, J.', 'Smakman, D.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study analyzes the swearing practices of men and women using the reality television gameshow Wie is de Mol? ‘Who is the Mole?’ (WIDM) as a corpus for natural spoken language. The aim of the study was to determine whether (1) there was a difference in the swearing practices of the male and female candidates, (2) if the situational context has an effect on these swearing practices, and (3) if these swearing practices have changed over the past decade (from 2011 to 2021). Additionally, this study hopes to contribute to the complex postmodern identity theory. The uttered swearwords during the WIDM episodes were then categorized according to gender, several characteristics of the swearword, and the situational context in which the swearword occurred. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in the overall swearing practices of the male and female candidates and that these practices have not changed over the past decade. However, an effect was found that the swearing rate increases in emotionally charged situations. Furthermore, four candidates’ swearing practices were individually analyzed and indicated that (1) the swearing practices were idiosyncratic, and (2) the fact that they swore more than the average candidate can be linked to their social identity.","['gender, identity, postmodern society, swearwords, realty television']"

Het Fundament van het Martinikaanse Huis: De drie dekolonisatienarratieven van Martinique,"Visser, Jean-Eric",['Prof. dr. P.J.J. Meel'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Martinique is sinds 1946 een Frans overzees departement. Op initiatief van de beroemde Martinikaanse poëet en politicus Aimé Césaire werd de eeuwenlange kolonisatie van zijn eiland in dit jaartal officieel beëindigd. De 'departementalisatie' van Martinique was een a-typische dekolonisatie in een tijdsgeest waarin gekoloniseerde 'onderworpenen' voor onafhankelijkheid streden. Met zijn initiatiefwet positioneerde Césaire zich ideologisch tegenover de andere beroemde antikoloniale Martinikaan die tevens zijn leerling is geweest, Frantz Fanon. De geboren Martinikaan en Algerijnse vrijheidsstrijder Fanon benoemde de revolutionaire strijd tegen de Franse kolonisator namelijk als de enige manier waarop zijn eiland gedekoloniseerd kon worden. Deze scriptie beschrijft de dekolonisatie van Martinique aan de hand van drie narratieven: de pragmatische visie van Césaire, de ideologische zienswijze van Fanon en het narratief van Frankrijk waarin assimilatie en gelijkheid de twee pijlers en tevens de twee paradoxen waren.","['Martinique, dekolonisatie, Césaire, Fanon, Frankrijk, assimilatie, Caraïben']"

Climate Justice in the UNFCCC? African Agency in the Loss and Damage Negotiations,"Borst, Reina","[""Alanna O'Malley""]",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"More than a purely ecological issue, the climate crisis is strongly rooted in colonial histories and linked to questions of global social justice. One way in which this notion of climate justice has come to be articulated in the international environmental regime is through the negotiations on, and institutionalisation of, “loss and damage” under the UNFCCC. The African Group of Negotiators – representing a continent which is particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts – has been an important actor in these negotiations, although its particular role has not substantively been studied. An important question is the extent to which the AGN manages to express agency within an international framework which exists against the backdrop of unequal global power relations – especially considering the relationship between this global order and the origins of anthropogenic climate change, and the already devastating impacts experienced. Using insights from structuration, complexity and frame theory, this research finds that while on one hand, the behaviour of the AGN reflects and in some ways reproduces status quo power relations, there is also potential for transformation – particularly through the use of strong, justice-based ideational arguments.","['Climate justice', 'Environmentalism', 'North-South relations', 'UNFCCC', 'Africa', 'African Group of Negotiators', 'Loss and Damage']"
Tracing the Cheraman Perumal,"Gianocostas, Lukas","['Gommans, J.J.L.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Over the past few centuries, multiple historiographical traditions have clashed over the study of Kerala history. Epistemological groups proposed here include archetypal historians who created original written histories with mythological elements, positivist historians who reject the mythological nature of the local histories, and post-structuralist historians who try to reconcile the useful historical data to be found in positivist and archetypal works. What has been lacking in this field has been a comparative study to explore the similarities and differences between these epistemologies, which this modest project seeks to present in the context of the historiographical 'journey' of Kerala's Cheraman Perumal legend. Concluding that there is a need for further post-structuralist study of the Cheraman Perumal, this project seeks to act as a call to action as an outsider to the field, to show why historians specializing in Kerala's history should be exploring the varied historiographical epistemologies to fill in the gaps in Kerala's history through previously ignored sources, specifically those of the Cheraman Perumal story.","['Kerala', 'Cheraman Perumal', 'Historiography', 'South India', 'Archetypal History', 'Positivism', 'Post-Structuralism']"

The analysis is based on two different female authors: Nalini Singh and Sarah J. Maas. The two authors were born into different cultures, are from different ethnicities, and are part of different generations. A sample of passages was selected from several of their published works which contain descriptions of the characters’ personality and appearance, and/or contains verbs that describe actions performed by or to the protagonist. Verbs and adjectives that met the criteria were analysed and divided into different categories, such as transactive/non-transactive, and descriptive/non-descriptive adjectives. The sets of data were compared to each other and analysed based on prior research in order to determine which author could be considered to be more progressive and why.","['Language', 'Culture', 'Ethnicity', 'Race', 'Female Authors']"
