The prediction of 15-year posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms with thyroid functioning and peritraumatic distress in injury survivors,"Dijk, Martijn van","['Mouthaan, J.', 'Zuiden, M. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction. Longitudinal prospective studies are needed to identify risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms 15 years after trauma, since cross-sectional findings do not inform how a possible pattern change as the clinical condition extends. Recently, thyroid hormones were in the top fifteen most relevant biochemical predictors for PTSD symptom trajectory within one year after trauma. Moreover, peritraumatic distress (PD) is highly associated with PTSD symptom severity. Nevertheless, most studies did not investigate the course of PTSD 15 years after a serious injury. This study hypothesized that higher thyroid functioning acutely after trauma, and higher PD predicted higher 15-year PTSD symptom severity, while the thyroid functioning mediated the relation between PD and 15-year PTSD symptom severity. Methods. This longitudinal prospective study examined 452 serious injury survivors. Blood samples were obtained acutely after trauma, and PD 23 days after trauma. PTSD symptom severity was assessed 15 years after trauma (M = 2.77, SD = 4.64), with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale. Results. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that 15-year PTSD symptom severity was not predicted by the thyroid hormones and PD, and the thyroid hormones did not mediate the relation between PD and 15-year PTSD symptom severity. Discussion. Our study showed the importance of predicting 15-year PTSD symptoms, since understanding how and when these symptoms occur could be crucial for treatment and promising for risk identification at an early stage. More longitudinal studies are needed to understand why some people do, and others do not develop 15-year PTSD symptoms.","['PTSD', 'thyroid', 'PDI', 'peritraumatic', 'longitudinal', '15 years', 'CAPS', 'prediction']"
Mama wanneer ben ik ooit goed genoeg? De vorming van een jongvolwassene door nalatigheid en feedback van een moeder,"van Weelde, Emma",['Rüya Akdag'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Iedereen reageert anders op feedback. Om aan te sluiten bij de behoeften van het kind en hen te leren omgaan met feedback, moeten scholen hierop kunnen inspelen. Dit onderzoek richt zich op de relatie tussen een nalatige ouderschapsstijl door moeder in de kindertijd en het leren van negatieve feedback. Een matig tot hoog niveau van sociale angst wordt hier gebruikt als modererende factor. De hypotheses van dit onderzoek luiden: ‘Er bestaat een negatieve relatie tussen het leren van negatieve feedback en een nalatige opvoedstijl van moeder in de kindertijd.’ en; ‘De correlatie tussen het leren van negatieve feedback en een nalatige opvoedstijl van moeder in de kindertijd wordt versterkt door een verhoogd niveau van sociale angst.’ De participanten zijn jongvolwassenen en zijn benaderd rondom de Universiteit Leiden. Door middel van twee testdagen zijn er diverse vragenlijsten gebruikt om data te verkrijgen. In het huidige onderzoek wordt er gebruik gemaakt van de LSAS, dat zich richt op sociale angst, en de PBI, wat gaat over de ervaren opvoedstijl in de jeugd, subcategorie moeder. Er is een probabilistische leertaak gebruikt voor het leren van positieve en negatieve feedback. Uit de gegevens komt naar voren dat er een marginale significante correlatie bestaat tussen de variabelen, terwijl de literatuur spreekt van een significantie. Toekomstig onderzoek kan deze studie bijvoorbeeld als een startpunt gebruiken voor het onderzoeken van de relatie tussen nalatige opvoedstijl, feedback leren, en sociale angst, corrigerend op de limitaties van de huidige studie.","['Jongvolwassenen, Moeder, Nalatige opvoedstijl, Negatieve feedback, Sociale angst']"
Betrokkenheid op de Paschalisschool: Een onderzoek naar het signaleren en vergroten van de betrokkenheid van bovenbouwleerlingen,"Kok, Ilse de","['Helder, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek gaat over betrokkenheid van leerlingen op basisschool Paschalis. Hier presteren leerlingen op cognitief gebied bovengemiddeld. Leerkrachten willen graag dat de cognitief sterkste leerlingen ook betrokken zijn, en zochten naar tools om de betrokkenheid te vergroten. Het doel van dit onderzoek was om de betrokkenheid van bovenbouwleerlingen op de Paschalis te peilen en om handvatten toe te reiken om de betrokkenheid te vergroten. Dit is onderzocht middels de volgende onderzoeksvraag: Hoe ervaren bovenbouwleerlingen op de Paschalis hun betrokkenheid tijdens de lessen waarbij expliciete directe instructie wordt gegeven? Komt dit overeen met hoe hun leerkrachten dit ervaren en hoe kunnen zij de betrokkenheid van hun leerlingen vergroten? Bovenbouwleerlingen en -leerkrachten vulden een vragenlijst in. De vragenlijsten bestonden uit gesloten en open vragen. De gesloten vragen hadden betrekking op de vormen van betrokkenheid, en de open vragen op de huidige situatie en hoe betrokkenheid vergroot kan worden. De algemene betrokkenheid van leerlingen op de Paschalis is relatief hoog. De vier vormen van betrokkenheid verschillen significant van elkaar, waarbij agentic engagement als het laagst wordt ervaren. Leerlingen en leerkrachten lieten hierbij een soortgelijke verdeling zien. Er is onderzocht of het vaardigheidsniveau van leerlingen invloed had op de betrokkenheid, wat voor zowel taal als rekenen niet significant bleek te zijn. In de open vragen van de vragenlijst zijn er suggesties gegeven om de betrokkenheid te vergroten, waarbij spelletjes en actieve werkvormen genoemd werden. Om betrokkenheid te vergroten kan er ingespeeld worden op het vergroten van agentic engagement, en op suggesties van de leerlingen.","['betrokkenheid', 'bovenbouw', 'engagement', 'agentic', 'emotional', 'behavioral', 'cognitive', 'leerlingen', 'basisschool']"

Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd met behulp van een cross-sectionele vragenlijst op het Amazon Mechanical Turk Online Platform. De vragenlijst is ingevuld door 105 (N =105) participanten die werkzaam zijn als vrijwilliger bij non-profit organisaties in de Verenigde Staten van Amerika. Een multipele regressieanalyse toonde dat er sprake is van een significant positief effect van zowel identificatie met de organisatie, als collectief psychologisch eigenaarschap van de organisatie, op de bereidheid om geld te doneren aan een non-profit organisatie. Uit multipele regressieanalyses bleek ook dat de warmte van de organisatie direct en positief bijdraagt aan identificatie met de organisatie en dat het gevoel van bij de organisatie te horen direct en positief effect heeft op gevoelens van collectief psychologisch eigenaarschap van de organisatie. Aanvullend toonde een eerste mediatieregressieanalyse dat er sprake is van een indirect en positief effect van de warmte van een organisatie op de bereidheid om geld te doneren, gemedieerd door de identificatie met de organisatie. De tweede mediatie regressieanalyse heeft laten zien dat er sprake is van een indirect en positief effect van het gevoel van het bij de organisatie horen op de bereidheid om geld te doneren, gemedieerd door collectief psychologisch eigenaarschap van de organisatie. De multipele regressieanalyses en de mediatie regressieanalyses lieten geen significante effecten zien wanneer de bereidheid om tijd te doneren, in de vorm van tijd (vrijwilligerswerk doen) als uitkomstvariabele werd gebruikt.

This study investigated a moderated mediation model which firstly examined whether attachment security of the child mediated the relation between the parent’s physiological stress reactivity and the child’s physiological stress reactivity. Secondly, it examined the moderating role of the type of child maltreatment, i.e. abuse versus neglect, in the relation between physiological stress reactivity of the parent and the child’s attachment security. Participations included 56 parent- child pairs from residential family clinics in the Netherlands. Participants were visited in the clinic. During the visit the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) was used to measure the child’s attachment security. Before and after the SSP, saliva samples were taken of both the parent and the child to measure the change in alpha-amylase levels as an indicator for the physiological stress response. The results indicated that the physiological stress reactivity of the parent and the child were not directly, nor indirectly, through the child’s attachment security, related. In addition, there were no differences between neglecting parents and abusing parents in the relation between physiological stress reactivity of the parent and the child’s attachment security. Further research is needed to investigate whether a coherence or a discrepancy is the case between the physiological stress reactivity of the parent and the child in maltreating families. And if so, whether this is related to the appropriateness of the parent’s reactions to the child’s stress signals.",

Shoppen vanaf je laptop of smartphone: Het effect van cognitieve afleiding op klanttevredenheid en aantal aankopen in een online webwinkel,"Varenkamp, Yasmin","['van der Weijden, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Online shoppen wordt steeds populairder over de wereld en wordt vaak zelfs boven fysiek shoppen gekozen. Echter vindt online vaak meer cognitieve afleiding plaats om de fysieke barrière tussen mens en webshop te doorbreken. Eerder onderzoek stelt al dat de klanttevredenheid omlaag gaat en het aantal aankopen omhoog gaat als gevolg van afleiding in fysieke winkels. In het huidige onderzoek wordt daarom onderzocht of deze gevolgen ook gelden voor online webwinkels. Met die informatie kunnen webwinkels namelijk beter inspelen op hun klanten. Om dit te onderzoeken is gebruik gemaakt van een nagebootste online webwinkel in de vorm van een online survey. Respondenten konden in één conditie shoppen onder invloed van cognitieve afleiding dat werd aangestuurd door een audiofragment. In de andere conditie konden respondenten shoppen zonder cognitieve afleiding. De variabele aantal aankopen is gemeten aan de hand van het gemiddelde gekochte items per conditie. De variabele klanttevredenheid is gemeten aan de hand van een 7-punts schaal die loopt van ‘strongly disagree’ tot ‘strongly agree’. Er is gebleken uit de resultaten dat de klanttevredenheid inderdaad omlaag gaat als de cognitieve afleiding hoger wordt. Echter is er een niet-significant resultaat gevonden voor de variabele aantal aankopen. Dit kan liggen aan de attentional conflict die de cognitieve afleiding met zich meebrengt tijdens het online shoppen. De drive die de respondenten hebben om iets te kopen wordt namelijk lager als ze meer attentional conflict ervaren. Kortom, afleiding kan beter niet worden toegepast in online webwinkels om de klanttevredenheid te waarborgen.",
How Do You Feel When You Want to Explain the World? Personal Agency on the Motivation to Experience Ideology-Reinforcing Emotions,"Groth, Joschua",['Ruthie Pliskin'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The current study investigated the relation between ideology and the motivation to regulate towards ideology congruent emotions (hope, fear, pride and guilt) in the context of reinforcing political ideology. By focussing on the relation between emotional characteristics (e.g., certainty) and individual characteristics of personal agency (e.g., responsibility) the current study examined whether personal agency moderates the relationship between ideology and emotional preferences. Two hundred-forty participants from the UK engaged in a behavioural task which assessed emotional preferences and a series of questionnaires assessing participants ideology, personal agency and demographics. A regression analysis of fear preferences indicated that rightist more than leftists, are more motivated to regulate towards fear. In direct comparison of emotional preferences (guilt vs. pride), leftists were more motivated than rightists to regulate towards guilt compared to pride. Other emotional preferences were non-significant and the moderating role of personal agency could not be confirmed either. The study provides further insights into motivated emotion regulation and various implications for future in the context of reinforcing ideological beliefs.","[': Ideology, Personal Agency, Emotion Regulation, Hope, Fear, Guilt, Pride']"

Set-shifting difficulties as a potential risk factor for adolescent Anorexia Nervosa,"Roovers, Aïda","['Van der Hiele, K.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The etiology of anorexia nervosa (AN) remains difficult to understand, and even harder to predict. Identifying possible risk factors is therefore crucial. Recent literature has suggested that impaired set-shifting (SS) in the anorexic population might play a role as an endophenotype, meaning it might make individuals more susceptible to developing this disorder. It has been established that SS abilities are impaired in adults with AN, but it is unclear whether this is also the case for younger age groups. In this study we aimed to get a better understanding of the possible SS impairment in adolescents with AN. We examined differences in SS abilities between female adolescents with AN and HC (N=72; AN=45, HC=27), between the ages of 12-21 years old (M=15.83, SD=2.08) using a MANOVA, and looked at the influence of food-related stimuli, activity-related stimuli, and neutral stimuli on SS abilities within both groups through ANCOVAs. We examined whether poor SS abilities are associated with low BMI, poor body image, and restrictive eating behaviors using multiple regression analyses, with age, AN subtype and intelligence level as covariates. We found no significant difference in SS abilities between the participants with AN and healthy controls (p=.20). Participants with AN performed significantly worse on the SS task with activity-related stimuli as compared to the food-related (p=.015) and neutral stimuli (p<.001). HC participants did not show a difference in performance between the three SS tasks (p=.17). We did not find a significant association between SS abilities and low BMI (p=.78), poor body image (p=.233) and restrictive behaviors (p=.197). Based on our findings, poor SS abilities do not seem to be associated with adolescent AN, but more research should be done into this topic to strengthen these results. Future research must additionally focus on finding alternative measures that can be understood as risk factors, and actively seek out new approaches that can be used in the prevention of this disorder.","['Anorexia Nervosa', 'eating disorder', 'set-shifting', 'cognitive flexibility', 'adolescent', 'risk factors']"

At-risk personality types in advanced cancer care: Does pessimism and trait anxiety predict patients’ chemotherapy side-effect expectations and do patients benefit from empathy or nocebo information? Findings from a scripted video-vignette RCT.,"Jansen, Sophie","['Vliet, L. M. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Background: To alleviate side-effect burden in advanced breast cancer, it is necessary to identify at-risk personality types and effective interventions. Previous research indicates that patients’ pessimism and trait anxiety may be risk factors for experiencing side-effects. To reduce their side-effect burden, optimizing patients’ side-effect expectations is suggested as a novel strategy. Doctor-patient communication strategies, such as expressing empathy (i.e. reassurance of nonabandonment) and explaining psychological mechanisms behind side-effects (i.e. a nocebo explanation), are most promising for optimizing patients’ expectations. In this experimental video-vignette study, we aimed to determine (1) whether clinician-expressed empathy and/or a nocebo explanation is effective in reducing expected side-effect burden, (2) whether generalized pessimism and trait anxiety relate to expected side-effect burden, and (3) whether there is an interaction between the effectiveness of these interventions and these personality characteristics. Methods: Using a two-by-two experimental video-vignette design, 159 cancer patients/survivors and healthy women watched one out of four videos with a nocebo explanation (present/absent) and empathy manipulation (present/absent). The effect of the interventions, the personality characteristics, and the interaction between these two were assessed using regression analyses. Differences between specific (e.g. hair loss) and nonspecific side-effects (e.g. fatigue) were investigated. Results: Clinician-expressed empathy, but not the nocebo explanation (p>.025), was successful in reducing expected side-effect occurrence (p=.008) and intensity (p=.003). Next, pessimistic patients expected side-effects to be more intense (p=.010), which was more profound in predicting the intensity of specific (p=.004), rather than nonspecific side-effects (p=.038). Moreover, results indicate an adverse effect of the nocebo explanation for pessimistic patients, as they expected nonspecific side-effects to be more intense after receiving this intervention (p=.014). Anxious patients expected a higher occurrence of nonspecific side-effects (p=.024), but not of specific side-effects (p=.435). No moderating role was found regarding patients’ anxiety and the effectiveness of the interventions. Conclusions: Short expressions of empathy by an oncologist can improve side-effect expectations. Generalized pessimism may cause patients to be vulnerable to expecting more intense side-effects, and to experiencing adverse effects from the nocebo explanation. Clinical follow-up studies need to investigate whether these results hold in clinical practice, and identify interventions for pessimistic cancer patients.","['nocebo effect', 'pessimism', 'anxiety', 'communication', '(advanced) cancer care', 'side-effects', 'chemotherapy', 'breast cancer', 'empathy']"

The Impact of COVID-19 on Prescription Psychotropic Drug Dispensing and Consumption: a 1-year Meta-analysis,"Smadi, Muhannad",['Dr. M.L. Molendijk'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has devastated many countries around the world leading to far-reaching transformations in society, which has been associated with adverse psychological symptoms. Psychotropic prescription drugs are a critical tool in treating and controlling a variety of psychopathological conditions, which raises concern in terms of potential overuse and irrational use. Available data regarding the use and prescribing practices of psychotropic prescription drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic are inconsistent. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted with the aim of investigating the change in psychotropic prescription drug use and dispensing in relation to COVID-19. Pub-med and Web of Science Databases were systematically searched, and a total of 30 studies were included (23 prevalence estimates, and 19 correlation coefficient estimates; N = 5,133,032). The yielded findings demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 16.34% (95% CI: 9.11 to 23.57) in prevalence estimates of psychotropic prescription drug use. Furthermore, the conducted meta-analysis yielded a small positive statistically significant correlation r = 0.1070 (95% CI: 0.0546 to 0.1593), implying a small increase in psychotropic prescription drug use and dispensing relative to pre and post COVID-19. The association between COVID-19 and adverse mental health, as well as the increased use of psychotropic medications, may lead to an upsurge in substance use related disorders and overdose-related deaths.","['COVID-19, psychotropic prescription drugs, psychopharmacology, prescribing, dispensing, systematic review, meta-analysis']"
Psychometric properties of the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory - 9 (PTCI-9) in a non-clinical trauma exposed sample,"Muller, Juliette","['Kooistra, M.J.', 'Kleine, R.A. de']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Posttraumatic cognitions are part of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), contributing to the development and maintenance of the disorder. To measure posttraumatic cognitions Foa et al. (1999) developed the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI). Later, Wells et al. (2019) shortened the PTCI to a 9-item version (PTCI-9), in an attempt to improve its psychometric properties. Objectives: A short version of the PTCI is highly warranted, as posttraumatic cognitions are directly linked to PTSD symptom severity. Therefore, the current study investigates the factor structure, reliability and validity of the PTCI-9 in a non-clinical trauma exposed sample. Methods: A sample of 149 participants were recruited in the Netherlands. Participants were not diagnosed with a mental disorder or were in treatment at the time of the study. Participants were asked to fill out a series of questionnaires, among which the PTCI. Results: Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) showed that a three-factor model was not a good fit for the PTCI-9. Results showed that the PTCI-9 was reliable (Cronbach’s α = 0.80). Analyses indicated moderate criterion validity (r(147) = .61, p < .001) and moderate correlations to depressive symptom measures (r(147) = -.04, p = .327), as well as weak correlations to childhood trauma measures (r(147) = .46, p < .001). Conclusions: The current study does not support a three-factor structure for the PTCI-9, although shortening the inventory improved model fit significantly compared to the 36-item version. The PTCI-9 is reliable and has moderate criterion and convergent validity. Possible implications are discussed.","['Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory – 9', 'factor structure', 'trauma exposed', 'psychometric properties']"

Activity of the Striatum in Individuals Exhibiting Antisocial Behavior After Receiving Social Feedback,"Smis, Merlijn","['Bos, M.B. + van de Groep, I.H.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Proper social behavior is learned through a process of social feedback from others, such as punishments and rewards. The striatum is important for feedback-based learning, as it is considered the reward center of the brain. This process could be dysfunctional in individuals exhibiting antisocial behavior, which could be explained by differences in striatum-activity after receiving social feedback. Non-clinically diagnosed participants (N=28, ages 18-30) were asked to fill out the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory (YPI) to determine their level of antisocial behavioral traits. During a Social Network Aggression Task (SNAT), the participants received positive, neutral, or negative feedback, accompanied by a picture of a peer on the participants’ profile, while in an MRI scanner to measure striatum activity. Participants could retaliate after feedback by sending noise blasts to their peer. No main effect of YPI scores on striatum activity was found, but only after adjusting for sex. No main effect of YPI scores on noise blast duration was found either. Female participants were found to potentially discriminate more between noise blast duration sent depending on the feedback valence received, compared to male participants. Our results do not support antisocial behavior being related to a defect in social reward-based learning in non-clinical individuals, but only after correcting for sex. Sex was found to be a confounding variable when analyzing antisocial behavior, which has not always been corrected in current literature.","['Striatum', 'social feedback', 'antisocial', 'fmri', 'neurology', 'reward-based learning']"
The burden of COVID: The association between PTSD symptoms and working in health care and an exploration of risk factors,"Ullrich, Annik Elisa","['Dr. Mouthaan, J', 'Kooistra, M.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: The strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of health care workers (HCW) may lead to an increase in posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) among them. Therefore, it is of importance to take a look at risk factors for developing PTSD in HCWs in the time of a pandemic. Objectives: This cross-sectional study aims (1) to compare PTSD symptom severity between HCWs and non-HCWs (NHCW) in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) to investigate the potential risk factors gender, resilience and pandemic-specific behavioral coping for developing PTSD within the HCWs sample during a pandemic. Method: Within a sample of 456 HCWs and NHCWs in the Netherlands, an online study was conducted measuring PTSD symptoms, levels of resilience, and pandemic-specific behavioral coping within the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. To compare PTSD symptom severity in HCWs and NHCWs an ANOVA was carried out. The contribution of risk factors was assessed with a multiple regression analysis. Results: The results showed that NHCWs have significantly higher PTSD symptom severity compared to HCWs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, in the HCW sample, resilience was associated, while gender and behavioral coping were not associated with more PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: These results of this survey are underlying the importance of the multilevel impact of the COVID-19 pandemic within society. It shows that mental health is negatively impacted across the general population and not only in HCWs. Furthermore, it gives insight into risk factors for PTSD in HCWs.","['COVID-19, health care workers, PTSD, risk factors']"

Aim: This study intended to develop and test the psychometric properties of the Suicide Prevention Skills Inventory (SPSI). Methods: A literature review identified seven subscales and 76 items for the SPSI. Using a cross-sectional design, data was collected in a sample of Dutch undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate healthcare students (N = 439), partaking in the online survey. An Exploratory Factor Analysis was performed on the continuous scales; inter-item, item-total and Pearson correlations were calculated for the binary scales. Cronbach’s alphas were calculated for all subscales and the overall instrument. Results: A four subscale solution (Provider Competencies, Moral Attitude, Experience Making Contact and Personal Interest in SP Skills Training) with 35 items showed the most optimal fit, with items loading >.40 on factors and good inter-item and item-total correlations. Reliability for the individual subscales and total scale ranges from good to excellent (α = .72-.90). Due to poor reliability the subscale Factual Knowledge was excluded. Discussion: The four subscale SPSI shows a stable latent structure and good reliability. However, validity of the instrument is only confirmed once results have been replicated in a new and representative sample. Future applications of the SPSI include the assessment of learning effects among HCPs in training and provide insight into the level of SP expertise of graduated HCPs starting their career in the clinical field","['Suicide Prevention', 'Suicide Prevention Skills Questionnaire', 'Healthcare Professionals in Training']"
Does Being Sensitive to Disgust and Threat Predicts Conservatism?,"Frkovich, Bratzo",['Benjamin Ruisch'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Past work has suggested a possible relation between political conservatism and sensitivity to threat and disgust. However, empirical results have been mixed, with other work failing to replicate these effects. We aimed to explore the specific conditions under which threat and disgust sensitivity may indeed predict conservatism. We hypothesized that threat/disgust sensitivity led to conservatism when individuals tend to rely on their automatic low-level reactions (faith in intuition), while this relationship was negative when individuals tend to reappraise negative information (rethinking the meaning of affectively charged stimuli). Although our preregistered analyses did not support our predictions, exploratory analyses found evidence for an interaction between threat sensitivity and faith in intuition in predicting conservatism, suggesting that conservatives validate their automatic low-level reactions as legitimate cues on the formation of their political attitudes.

Vuyk'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"There is insufficient substantiation in the literature about the effect of an unconditional basic income (UBI) on willingness to work. To introduce a new benefit system, it’s important that the effect of an OBI is empirically substantiated. For this reason, the study has worked to broaden empirical knowledge on this topic. It has been investigated whether there is an effect of receiving an UBI compared to a conditional basic income (CBI) on willingness to work? In addition, it was examined whether maximization tendency and intrinsic motivation have an influence on the frequency to accept work. To investigate this, experimental research has been carried out. The research was conducted online by 103 participants. The participants were randomly distributed over two conditions: unconditional and conditional basic income. To measure the willingness to work and work commitment, participants worked on Real Effort Task. To measure maximization tendency, the Maximizing Tendency Scale 7 was completed and to measure intrinsic motivation the subscale Intrinsic Job Motivation of the Work and Life Attitude Scale was administered. When somebody receives an UBI, they are more likely to take up work and show a higher work effort than someone who receives a CBI. No relationship was found between maximization tendency, intrinsic motivation, and the amount that the participants accepted work. It’s recommended in future research to use a field study in which willingness to work can be measured in addition to an OBI.",

The present study (N = 13,287, 52% female, mean age 14.3) is part of a youth health monitor conducted in 2019 by the Dutch Public Health Service North and East Gelderland. It examined whether adolescents with a mentally ill family member experienced more stress and emotional problems and whether they were less resilient than other adolescents. Participants were secondary school students in the 2nd and 4th grade who completed a questionnaire. The results of the ANOVA’s showed that adolescents with a mentally ill family member displayed more stress and emotional problems, and less resilience than other adolescents, however, effect sizes were small. After controlling for financial problems, household composition, gender and age, these differences proved to be even smaller. Furthermore, the findings showed that adolescents with financial problems had more stress and emotional problems and were less resilient compared to adolescents without financial problems. In addition, adolescents with an intact household demonstrated less stress and emotional problems than adolescents without an intact household. However, resilience did not significantly differ between adolescents with and without an intact household. Furthermore, female adolescents exhibited more stress and emotional problems and were less resilient than male adolescents. Effect sizes for all differences were small, except for the moderate effect size of gender on stress and emotional problems. For further research into the relationship between having a mentally ill family member and psychosocial problems, we recommend including variables such as self-esteem and coping strategies.",

Effects of gaming on the perception of emotional expressions in real and virtual faces,"Elsässer, Moritz",['Dr.ir. R.E. de Kleijn'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"There are a multitude of disorders that affect emotional processing and emotion recognition, therefore negatively affecting everyday human interaction of those afflicted by those disorders. Virtual reality training could provide a safe, yet realistic tool to help train and treat people with emotional processing impairments at its core. Attempting to help develop such tools, our study examined the difference of emotion recognition of avatar and human faces. We predicted that previous exposure to virtual worlds, through gaming, would influence metrics like confidence and intensity of perceived emotions. Touching up on previous research, we looked at how a violent video gaming affects confidence and intensity metrics of recognition of negative emotions. We did not find support for gaming influencing a difference in emotion recognition of avatar and human faces. However, our data was in line with previous literature showing that violent video gaming influences the ratings of negative emotions. Virtual world exposure, such as gaming, not having an immediate effect on emotion recognition of avatars is a useful finding as it helps validating a virtual reality training tool to a diverse range of people with differing previous exposure to virtual avatars. The study introduces new metrics to emotion recognition research and provides a starting point in validating virtual reality training tools for patients with emotional processing disorders.","['Emotion perception, emotion recognition, gaming, virtual reality training tool, virtual exposure']"

An important predictor of BPS is childhood maltreatment. The present study focuses on two forms of child maltreatment: emotional maltreatment (EM) and sexual maltreatment (SM). Previous studies have indicated a link between EM and IP. This is evidenced by the resulting susceptibility to rejection and trust issues. SM has also been shown to affect the process of identity formation, which can lead to IP. A relationship between SM and IP has also previously been found, because of the influence of SM on the process of identity formation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between EM and IP, and between SM and IP. It is expected that EM and SM positively predict IP. Furthermore, a stronger relationship is expected for EM than for SM. Methods: An online questionnaire was used to measure the form of child abuse and identity problems with a sample of the general population (n = 187). A multiple linear regression analysis was performed, calculating the effect of EM on IP and the effect of SM on IP. Results: EM was a significant predictor of IP. In contrast, there was no significant predictive effect of SM on IP. EM appears to be a better predictor than SM on IP. Discussion: Although more research is needed on the relationship between SM and IP, these observations suggest that EM more strongly predicts IP than SM. The non-significant predictive effect of SM on IP was striking, taking into regard existing literature, but may be due to sample characteristics. This study can be used to further investigate the causes and consequences of identity problems.","['identityproblems, borderline personality disorder, emotional maltreatment, sexual maltreatment']"

DENK en het profiel van haar achterban zijn eerder al onderzocht door middel van kwantitatieve studies, maar in de literatuur ontbreekt een analyse die verklaart welke processen voor kiezers van belang zijn om op DENK te stemmen. Door middel van zestien semigestructureerde interviews met Marokkaans-Nederlandse en Turks-Nederlandse DENK-stemmers en niet-DENK-stemmers, is hier onderzocht welke mechanismen met betrekking tot etnische en religieuze verbondenheid, sociale structuren, en vertegenwoordiging door andere partijen, van belang zijn voor DENK-stemmers. Zij geloven voornamelijk dat de partij het beste opkomt voor de belangen van hun groep en kiezen voor DENK omdat een deel van hen zich slecht vertegenwoordigd voelt door andere linkse partijen. Daarnaast worden DENK-stemmers via video’s op sociale media geïnformeerd en gemobiliseerd, en worden Turks-Nederlandse jongeren via migrantenorganisaties zoals moskeeën gemotiveerd om op DENK te stemmen.

The extent of relapse in depressive symptoms in students during corona crisis and the effect of gender on this.,"Dijck, Vieve van","['Luenen, S. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Previous research shows that many students suffer from depressive symptoms. The prevalence of this has increased substantially in the corona crisis. This study examined the extent to which students who have previously experienced depression have relapsed into depressive symptoms in the period from June 2020 to June 2021, using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). In addition, we examined the influence of gender on this association. The study uses data from the Caring Universities project. The questionnaire was completed by 513 students at both measurement points. The sample of participants who had previously experienced depression consisted of 182 people. The participants were on average 22 years old at the start of the study. Contrary to expectations, no significant difference was found between the June 2020 and June 2021 PHQ-9 scores. In addition, gender also did not play a role in the similarity of depression scores between the two measurement points. Both female and male students had nearly equal PHQ-9 scores at both measurement points. Further research is needed to identify the impact of corona crisis on relapse in depressive symptoms among students and to analyze the role of gender on this.","['Depressive symptoms, corona, relapse, students']"

An irreverent proclamation in the face of an evolving German state. As migration continues to bear heavy political weight in the German context, this analysis seeks address apparent discrepancies in the media and political response to various waves of migration. In 2022, the graphic imagery of Russian encroachment in Ukraine, on European soil, has rightfully invoked global condemnation and dismay in response. The findings of this research indicated a difference in framing between the three selected focusing events: Syrian Civil War in 2015, Taliban governance in 2021 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. As immigration, integration and naturalization remain highly contested issues areas in the modern German state, particularly when concerning the incorporation of peoples from Muslim-majority countries, this paper seeks to highlight this dimension of the evolution of Germany's national narrative.","['Migration, Asylum, Germany, Media Frames, Framing, Nationalism']"

However, the number of military interventions did not decrease since 1989. The exact intentions of military interventions are hard to find out. Yet, the effects should inherently improve human rights practices in the state in conflict. In this thesis, two types of human rights practices are distinguished: government respect for physical human rights and government respect for political rights and civil liberties. A large N study is done to measure the effect of military interventions since 1989 on these human rights aspects. It is argued that five years after an intervention takes place, there will be less physical harm to citizens. However, the effect on political rights appears to be diminishing. In addition, to contribute to the discussion about who should intervene, an analysis about the intervener’s political system is included in this thesis. The results impose important questions and debates, both about the intentions and effects of foreign troops intervening in a conflict, and about the conceptualization and cultural debate about human rights violations.",

It is important to know what adolescents need to know about sexting. To this end, it is necessary to be able to distinguish between normal sexual behaviour and transgressive sexual behaviour. The aim of this study is to find out whether sexting is normal sexual behaviour or transgressive behaviour and to examine the causes and consequences of sexting and to investigate which groups are at highest risk for transgressive sexting. To find out, the following research question was formulated: When does sexting become transgressive behaviour, and when is it part of the normal healthy sexual development of adolescents in 2021? In order to answer this question, we conducted a systematic literature review and screened 108 studies, 15 studies were included. These studies suggest that sexting refers to ‘sending, receiving or forwarding sexually explicit messages, images or photos to others via digital platforms.’ and is associated with a range of negative causes and consequences (e.g. mental health problems) However, twelve out of the 15 studies did not differentiate between normal and transgressive sexting. Three of the 15 studies looked at sexting under duress, and found that victims of sexting under duress may experience mental health problems, sexual problems and attachment disorders. Perpetrators of sexting under duress are more often aggressive in relationships and more often use violence towards their partner. However, those studies included all types of sexting as coercive sexting. Only one study indicated that there were no negative consequences of sexting for adolescents, provided that involved parties participated voluntary.","['sexting', 'seksuele ontwikkeling', 'grensoverschrijdend gedrag']"

The effects of replications on scientific success: A conceptual replication of Makel et al. (2012),"Alderden, Max","[""Veer, A.E. van 't""]",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this paper we extended the work of Makel et al. (2012) by finding the replication rate for the years 2012 till 2020. We found a replication rate of 1.39%. Compared to the 1.07% replication rate found by Makel et al. (2012) this is roughly 0.22% higher, which is roughly a 30% increase. This is a smaller increase than what we had hoped to find after the release of their paper and the expected effects of this release. With this we can conclude that the research community still undervalues the creation of replication papers. This finding implicates the importance of figuring out what is keeping researchers from performing replications. In the rest of this study we’ve made a head start at answering the question of why this might be the case. We expected to find that researchers undervalue replications due to them having too little impact on the scientific success of papers. We measured this by comparing the Mean Normalized Citation Scores (MNCS) of papers, depending on the type of replication they received and the success rate of the replication, to the average MNCS of papers. We found no significant differences for papers that received direct successful, direct unsuccessful and failed conceptual replications. We found significantly lower MNCS for papers that received successful conceptual replications. The effects of conceptual replications were inverted to our expectations. This is something that needs further attention in future research. Finally we also looked at if direct replications had more impact on the MNCS of original papers than conceptual replications. We did not find a significant difference in effects, but our findings of this are inconclusive due to the inverted relation of conceptual replications and the MNCS of their original papers. Our results show that replication studies do not appear to be significantly impacting the success level of their original papers (except for successful conceptual replications). The insignificant impact of replications papers may therefore play a role in the undervaluation of replications in the scientific research community. We invite other researchers to further explore the reasons for the undervaluation. Hopefully, by this, we will rather sooner than later get to a world with reliable and validated research.",
The Effect of Parental Verbal Threat (vs. Safety) Expressions on Children’s Fear Beliefs about Strangers and the Moderating Role of Child Social Anxiety: The Effect of Parental Verbal Threat (vs. Safety) Expressions on Children’s Fear Beliefs about Strangers and the Moderating Role of Child Social Anxiety,"Hunnik, Nicky van","['Aktar, E., PhD']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background..Fear cognitions are known to play an important role in social anxiety disorder (SAD). The transmission of fears is extensively explored in earlier research, and findings indicate that parental verbal information transmission plays a fundamental role in the development of children’s fear beliefs. The current study investigated the effect of parental verbal (threatful/anxious vs. safety) information transmission on children’s fear cognitions in the context of a social performance task with a stranger judge. Also, the role of child trait social anxiety was considered as a moderator. Methods. Young adolescents (N = 71), aged 10-14, together with a parent participated in the prospective experimental study. Parents provided a standardised script (threatful vs. safety information) about each of the judges, and the children’s fear beliefs of the stranger (FBQ) was measured. Trait social anxiety was measured with the SCARED questionnaire. Results. Child fear beliefs of the strangers linked to the threatful information were significantly higher compared to the fear beliefs score of the strangers linked to positive information. Child trait social anxiety did not moderate this effect. Conclusions. The results of the present real-life experimental study highlight the importance of parental verbal information transmission processes in the creation of cognitive fear beliefs in young adolescents, raising awareness of what contributes to the cognitive part of social fears within families.",

Emotionele expressie bij mensapen: Onderzoek naar het spiegelen van een speelgezicht bij gorilla’s in Diergaarde Blijdorp,"Snip, Lorena","['Zijlstra, T.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Emotionele expressies zijn nuttig voor mensen en mensapen en evolutionair gezien voordelig voor communicatie met soortgenoten. Een speelgezicht tonen kan gezien worden als een emotionele expressie. Eerder onderzoek suggereert dat gorilla’s, behorend tot de mensapen, een speelgezicht kunnen tonen en dat gorilla’s speelgezichten kunnen spiegelen. Een speelgezicht is te herkennen aan een ontspannen, open mond met opgetrokken mondhoeken. Het is niet duidelijk of gorilla’s een speelgezicht spiegelen wanneer ze zelf niet aan het spelen zijn. Daarom zijn gorilla’s uit Diergaarde Blijdorp geobserveerd en is er onderzocht of gorilla’s significant vaker een speelgezicht toonden wanneer ze naar filmpjes van spelende gorilla’s met een speelgezicht (speel-filmpjes) keken, vergeleken met controle-filmpjes. In dit onderzoek is dit niet significant aangetoond. Dit suggereert dat gorilla’s geen speelgezicht spiegelen van andere individuen, als ze zelf niet aan het spelen zijn. Dit kan betekenen dat het vermogen tot het spiegelen van een speelgezicht nog niet aanwezig was bij de gemeenschappelijke voorouders van gorilla’s en mensen. Daarnaast blijkt uit dit onderzoek dat naar andere individuen kijken, krabben, neus afvegen en gapen niet significant vaker voorkomen bij nietspelende gorilla’s die kijken naar speel-filmpjes, vergeleken met controle-filmpjes. Dit suggereert dat het kijken naar spelende gorilla’s geen invloed heeft op de drang naar sociale interactie en op het ervaren van stress door de kijkende gorilla. Vervolgonderzoek is nodig om de resultaten van dit onderzoek te reproduceren en te bepalen of deze te generaliseren zijn naar andere gorilla’s en mensapen.","['emotionele expressie', 'speelgezicht spiegelen', 'mensaap', 'gorilla']"
Dynamic Testing of Reading and Writing: Analyzing the effect of training in relation to potential (gender) differences between children with and without dyslexia,"Timmers, Hester","['Vogelaar, B.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study investigated the effect of a dynamic test in reading and writing compared to a static test for 87 children in elementary schools in the Netherlands (aged 7-9 years old). Static tests measure the knowledge a child already has at the moment of testing, while on the other hand in a dynamic test children are provided with feedback, prompts or training in order to demonstrate more of their learning potential. Dynamic tests are especially useful for children with intellectual disabilities or learning impairments. Children with and without the diagnosis of dyslexia were allocated to either the experimental or the control condition. Children in the experimental condition of this study received a training in between pretest and posttest, whereas those in the control condition received the training after the posttest. Results showed a positive effect of training on the subtests prosodic awareness, spelling sounds and verbs and context dependent spelling, meaning that the group who received the dynamic test showed more progress from pretest to posttest in these subtests than the group who received the static test. This difference in progress did not apply to the subtest phonemic awareness. No significant gender differences and differences in performance between the dyslexic and the non-dyslexic children were found.","['Dynamic Testing', 'Dyslexia', 'Gender', 'Reading', 'Writing']"

Attentional Reorientation towards Threatening Stimuli: Timing and Involvement of the Right Angular Gyrus,"Gerbracht, Jan",['Dr. Manon Mulckhuyse'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Reorientation of attention is a fundamental part of human cognition. Spatial orientation is generally associated with dorsoparietal regions in the brain. Particularly, the posterior parietal cortex, the lateral intraparietal cortex, and the right angular gyrus (AG) are assumed to mediate redirection of attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli. However, exact mechanisms and effect structures of reorienting to biologically significant stimuli have not been comprehensively identified. Time course and coordination in the dorsoparietal cortex remain unclear. Previous research has shown prioritized processing of emotional stimuli, particularly if threatening. Such affective processing is often associated with faster, subcortical activity. In the present study mediation by the right AG of reorienting to threat is examined. A spatial cueing paradigm was used and single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to the right AG at different stimulus onset synchronies (SOA) after target onset. Threat was introduced by means of differential fear conditioning of the targets stimulus. General linear mixed models with logit transform were used for analysis. TMS was predicted to interfere with reorienting (during invalid-cue trials) at an early SOA when threat is present. No such effects were observed. Rather, mediation by the right AG appeared to predominantly facilitate a correct response for contralateral targets. Further, TMS at 210 ms SOA improved performance for valid-cue conditions, independent of threat, suggesting that the right AG may act as inhibitory control. The discussed findings indicate a need for further investigation and suggested replication of more fundamental assumptions, such as direction of effects and lateralization of the AG.",
Measuring Planning Ability with Four-in-a-Row and Identifying the Relationship with Impulsivity During Adolescence,"Nanda, Raisha","['Ma, I.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Does Planning Ability (PA) improve with age, is PA advanced in adolescents who are less impulsive and what is the effect of both age and impulsivity on PA? This study aimed to find answers on above mentioned questions. The study has an experimental cross-sectional design and is part of a larger research project about identifying computational components that underlie planning skills. Participants were 157 adolescent citizens from the United States (range = 8.02 – 25.90, M = 15.83, SD = 5.08), of which 78 women, 77 men and 2 missing genders. Data of participants playing Four-in-a-row, an alternative form of tic-tac-toe, has been analysed to measure PA. Impulsivity is measured with unidimensional Barratt Impulsiveness Scale–Brief (BIS-Brief), the shortened version of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11). Age (Wilks’ Lambda: F (2,146) = .321; p = .726) and Impulsivity (Wilks’ Lambda: F (2,146) = .701; p = .498) both showed non-significant effects on the outcome measures Mean Difficulty Level (MDL) and Mean Reaction Time (MRT) (indicators of PA). The interaction effect was not significant either (Wilks’ Lambda: F (2,146) = .475; p = .623). Age was significantly and positively correlated with MDL, MRT and negatively correlated with impulsivity. MDL and MRT were significantly moderately correlated and impulsivity was negatively correlated with MRT but not significantly with MDL. All in all, with age, impulsivity does not affect PA differently. However, the correlations suggest that with age people improved in MDL, made slower decisions and became less impulsive. Probably, MDL and MRT were not suitable outcome measures for PA, but measuring PA by means of the computational models and when Four-in-a-Row meets the COTAN standards, it is possible to reach a more ecologically valid measurement tool that can measure accurate PA.","['Planning Ability, Impulsivity, Reaction time']"

Specific mood syndromes are associated with particular phases of the menstrual cycle, and the prevalence of mood disorders is higher in women. We aimed to investigate, whether the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle has a negative effect on anxiety levels, through temporarily increased attention to negative emotional stimuli, referred to as attentional bias (AB). We collected data on 194 healthy participants using online surveys and an emotional dot-probe task (eDPT), with pictorial stimuli of emotional facial expressions (angry, fearful, happy, and neutral). We aimed to investigate whether different groups of participants (follicular phase women (N = 30), luteal phase women (N = 24), oral contraceptive using women (N = 75), and men (N = 65)) would exhibit ABs in the eDPT. We hypothesized that luteal phase women would show larger AB for emotional stimuli, and, specifically, angry and fearful stimuli. Further, we expected that differences in state anxiety levels between the groups would account for differences in AB. Our results did not support our hypotheses. We found a significant AB for emotional faces over neutral faces, and different average response times depending on the specific emotion in a given trial. However, the magnitude of these effects was the same for follicular phase women, luteal phase women, OC users, and men. Further, these results were unaffected by state anxiety levels of the participants. From these results, we could conclude that there simply is no difference in AB for emotional stimuli between the chosen groups of participants, using the eDPT. Alternatively, methodological constraints might have contributed to these null findings.","['menstrual cycle', 'anxiety', 'attentional bias', 'dot-probe task', 'oral contraceptives', 'cognition', 'mood']"
Psychopaths’ Moral Decision Making in an Empathy Dictator Game,"Gruner, Christopher Luis","['Overgaauw, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Deficiencies in empathic functioning are known to lay at the core of psychopathy and have been suggested to explain their immoral behavior. Although empathy can be divided into affective and cognitive components which have been shown to play an integral role in information processing when viewing others’ morally laden actions, the individual contribution of each component on the interpersonal behavior remains to be determined. This study set out to investigate whether incarcerated psychopathic offenders evaluate social situations different to non-psychopathic controls. An adapted version of the Dictator Game using an empathy induction protocol was employed to measure prosocial sharing behavior indicative of how an agent’s behavior is evaluated. Psychopaths showed less differentiation in sharing behavior which might be explained by an impairment of the affective component of empathy. Therefore, the tendencies of psychopaths to adjust to these scenarios should be taken into account when creating treatment plans against recidivism in psychopathic offenders.","['Psychopathy', 'Moral Decision Making', 'Empathy', 'Dictator Game']"

The Role of Optimism and Pain Catastrophizing in the Counter-Conditioning of the Nocebo Effect: A study to identify the relationship between optimism and pain catastrophizing with the nocebo effect and its reduction in females with fibromyalgia,"Balkum, Iris van",['Simone Meijer'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: The nocebo effect has been shown to play an important role in fibromyalgia, with some research naming counterconditioning as a possible treatment for this effect. Research suggests pain catastrophizing and optimism appear to influence the strength of the nocebo effect and possibly its reduction. We examined if it is possible to induce and later reduce the nocebo effect through counterconditioning with pressure stimuli and whether optimism and pain catastrophizing are related to this process. Methods: 7 women diagnosed with fibromyalgia underwent nocebo conditioning, to induce a nocebo effect on pressure pain, followed by counterconditioning, intended to reduce this nocebo effect again. A sham TENS device was used as conditioning stimulus and paired with moderate (nocebo conditioning), non-painful (counterconditioning), and slightly painful (serving as control during all procedures pressure) pressure stimuli. Through self-report questionnaires, the personality traits optimism and pain catastrophizing were measured. Results A significant nocebo effect was induced after nocebo conditioning (t(6) = 3.152, p = .020), and a placebo effect was induced during the nocebo reduction (t(6) = -4.235, p = .005). Furthermore, the nocebo effect was reduced significantly from conditioning to after counterconditioning (t(6) = 4.157, p = 0.006). The results of a multiple regression analysis showed no significant relationship between optimism, pain catastrophizing and the strength of the nocebo effect (F(2, 4) = .018, p = .982), the strength of the placebo effect (F(2, 4) = 1.115, p = .412) or the reduction of the nocebo effect (F(2, 4) = .251, p = .789). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that it is possible to induce a nocebo effect on pressure pain in participants with fibromyalgia. Additionally, it is also possible to reduce a nocebo effect through counterconditioning and even change it into a placebo effect. This study further indicates that optimism and pain catastrophizing do not significantly predict the induction of the nocebo effect or its reduction through counterconditioning in females with fibromyalgia. These results on the effectiveness of counterconditioning could help in developing future treatments for fibromyalgia by removing the nocebo effect and possibly creating a placebo effect.","['fibromyalgia, nocebo, conditioning, counterconditioning, optimism, pain catastrophizing, pressure pain, placebo, nocebo reduction']"
Optimising Exposure Therapy for PTSD - Emotional Variability and Within-session Habituation as Predictors of Treatment Outcome,"Cheng, Boley",['Ms. Marike Kooistra'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Exposure therapy is among the first-line treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, not all patients benefit from the treatment, resulting in low treatment efficacy. Recent research explored different markers leading to enhanced treatment outcomes, such as variability of subjective stress. Variability of subjective stress, or emotional variability, is associated with positive treatment results in exposure therapy. Yet, such findings are not extended to exposure therapy for PTSD patients. This study analysed the data of 103 childhood abuse-related PTSD (CA-PTSD) patients from a large-scale RCT IMPACT study. The effects of within-session habituation and emotional variability on the alleviation of PTSD symptoms were investigated. The two variables were operationalised by subjective units of distress (SUDS), whereas the treatment outcome, PTSD symptoms, was measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). The results of hierarchical regression showed that the first marker, within-session habituation significantly predicted clinical improvements upon completion of exposure therapy, after controlling for the number of sessions and treatment conditions. The second marker, emotional variability, also accounted for positive treatment outcomes. This study elucidated the potential benefits of tapping into the two variables during exposure using a clinical sample. Follow-up research regarding the change mechanism that underlies treatment efficacy and long-term benefits is warranted.","['posttraumatic stress disorder, emotional variability, emotion processing theory, inhibitory learning theory, subjective unit of distress']"
De rol van CA en cortisol in de ontwikkeling van depressieklachten na de eerste lockdown tijdens de COVID-19 pandemie,"Venema, Melanie",['Prof. dr. A. van Harmelen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Background: It is unclear if COVID-19 measurements affect adolescent with a history of Childhood Aversity (CA) more than other adolescents. It is important to find out, because CA already predicts more risk for psychological problems such as depression. CA can also have an impact on the stress hormone cortisol, which can lead to less or more depressive symptoms. Research is needed to find out if CA and cortisol can be of risk for developing depression after lockdown due to COVID-19 or if adolescents will be resilient to these kinds of stressors. Method: The sample consisted of 89 adolescents with a history of CA, recruited through an earlier study named Resilience after Individual Stress Exposure (RAISE). The adolescents filled in two questionnaires: Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and Mood and feelings questionnaire (MFQ). They also performed an fMRI stress task (MIST) where prior to this test blood was contained for measurement of cortisol. After the first lockdown of COVID-19 the MFQ was filled in again. Results: The results stated that after the lockdown the depression symptoms were increased (Z = 4,122, p < .001). But threat and deprivation (both CA) were not predictors of cortisol (threat: b = -.214, t (87) = -200, p = .842, deprivation: b = .316, t (87) = .2523, p = .801). Cortisol did not have mediation effect between threat/deprivation and changes in depression symptoms (threat: 95% CI [-.017,.026], deprivation: 95% CI [-.037,.031]). And lastly only threat was a predictor for changes in depression symptoms (b = .255, t (87) = 2.3863, p = .019). Discussion: This research has proved that there is an increase in depressive symptoms after the first lockdown in April of the year 2020. Secondly, history of threat and deprivation are not predictors of cortisollevels in the adolescence. Third, cortisol did not play a mediation role between CA (threat/deprivation) and depressive symptoms. Lastly, threat predicts depressive symptoms after the lockdown. In future similar situations, to prevent development of (more) depressive symptoms that may lead to depression disorder, extra support for adolescents, especially with history of threat, is needed.","['Childhood Adversity', 'Cortisol', 'COVID-19', 'Bedreiging', 'Deprivatie', 'Lockdown', 'Depressieklachten', 'nare jeugdervaringen']"
Reducing objectivity bias from visual evidence with a ‘consider-the-opposite’ bias warning,"Egmond, Afke van",['Lotte van Dillen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Video is often regarded as a complete, objective account of events, and therefore we rarely question its validity. However, our interpretation of video can be biased by many factors. Therefore, we investigated whether we could reduce the overestimating of the objectivity of visual evidence used in police cases. To do that, we showed participants either camera footage of a possible crime, or a textual description of this video. Half of the participants were given a bias warning which asked them to explicitly generate an alternative explanation to their first impression of the evidence (‘consider-the-opposite’ strategy); the other half did not. We compared these four groups on how likely they thought it was that the suspects were guilty, their verdict (guilty/not guilty), and the confidence they had in their judgment. We expected that participants who saw the video would judge the probability of guilt of the suspects as higher than people who read the text, but found the opposite. This could be due to certain aspects of the evidence being more salient in visual or textual form. We explored this using qualitative analysis of participants’ first impressions and alternative explanations of the evidence. Contrary to our expectations, the bias warning did not effectively reduce this difference in guilt judgments between people who saw the video and people who read the text. We did not find that individual differences moderated the effectiveness of the warning, but differences in perspective taking and the perceived objectivity of video did predict the estimated likelihood of guilt. We also did not find that confidence in judgment differed between the four groups. We discuss implications of these findings and give recommendations for future research to further explore how we regard certain visual and textual elements in evidence, and how individual differences play a role in our interpretation of evidence.","['visual evidence', 'police', 'bias warning', 'consider-the-opposite strategy']"

The relationship between executive functions and problem behaviour in adolescence.,"Baktash, Forugh","['Bos, M.G.N.', 'Peters, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Adolescence is a peak age of onset for many psychiatric disorders and a period for development of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Previous cross-sectional studies imply a relationship between executive function and problem behaviour. However, to understand these relationships and how they develop, more evidence is required and prospective designs are essential. Current prospective study explored the relationships between age, sex, executive function and problem behaviour. In addition, it studied whether executive functions (inhibition, cognitive flexibility, working memory and planning and organizing) predict problem behaviour. A community sample of 175 adolescents between 8-16 years old underwent an MRI scan three times, with a two-year interval. Problem behaviour was measured by the Dutch translated version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (Verhulst et al., 1996) and the executive functions were measured by the Dutch translated parent-report version of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) (Smidts & Huizinga, 2009). Pearson correlations, Analyses Of Variance (ANOVA), Independent-samples T-tests and Multiple Regression Analyses were performed. The analyses showed strong associations between cognitive flexibility and internalizing problem behaviour, and between inhibition and externalizing problem behaviour. In addition, when comparing sex difference, a significant difference was found between sex and internalizing problem behaviour, and between sex and planning and organizing. Other sex differences were not found. Results from this study suggest that there is an association between poorer executive function skills and the severity of internalizing and externalizing problem behaviour. Our findings also suggest a relationship between sex and internalizing problem behaviour, and between sex and planning and organizing. Effective interventions could be developed in the future to enhance executive functions and decrease the development of clinical problems.","['executive functions', 'adolescence', 'problem behaviour']"

This low social well-being may be related to specific traits or behaviors associated with autism, such as limited cognitive flexibility. The present study investigated the relationship between cognitive flexibility and social well-being for children with ASD and whether age and gender play a role in the relationship between cognitive flexibility and social-wellbeing. A total of 167 children (93 boys and 74 girls) participated in the current study. Of the participants 58 children had ASD and 109 participants were typically developing children. To measure cognitive flexibility participants completed the Shifting Set Visual (SSV), a subtest of the ANT. Social well-being was measured using the Social Inadequacy subscale of the NPV-J-2. Based on the results, it can be concluded that younger children achieved a significant lower score on cognitive flexibility than older children. No significant difference was found between autistic children and typically developing children in the scores on cognitive flexibility. Furthermore, a relationship was found between age and social well-being, with older children having lower social well-being compared to younger children. A relationship was also found between cognitive flexibility and social well-being, with lower cognitive flexibility associated with lower social well-being. No moderating role was found for gender in the relationship between cognitive flexibility and social well-being of children with ASD. This study showed promising results on the relationship between cognitive flexibility and social well-being for children with ASD. Further research can examine whether improving cognitive flexibility leads to an improved social well-being for children with ASD. This could potentially lead to starting points for treating low social well-being in children with autism.","['Autismespectrumstoornissen, sociaal welzijn, cognitieve flexibiliteit']"

During childhood and adolescence, the relationship between siblings changes especially in the amount of warmth and conflict between them. Previous research shows that the experience of differential parenting can cause feelings of jealousy, which in turn affects the quality of the sibling relationship in forms of less warmth and more physical or psychological aggression. The current cross-sectional study examined the relation between differential parenting and physical or psychological aggression between siblings and the potential moderating role of the warmth within the sibling relationship. The sample consisted of 22 children between 9 and 18 years old and their 19 younger siblings also between 9 and 18 years old. The study used online self-report questionnaires to measure the experienced differential parenting (SIDE), sibling physical and/or psychological aggression (CTS2-SP) and the perceived warmth within the sibling relationship (SRQ-S). The results showed a significant relation between differential parenting and psychical or psychological aggression within the sibling relationship for the youngest siblings. This means that when the youngest sibling is experiencing differential parenting, there also will occur more physical or psychological aggression. This relation remained significant when controlling for warmth between the sibling relationship. This relation was not found for the older siblings, which means that when the older siblings experience differential parenting this will not lead to physical or psychological aggression. No significant moderation effect was found for warmth within the sibling relationship on the relation between differential parenting and physical and/or psychological aggression for both the oldest and youngest siblings. Future research should focus more on the possibilities that sibling relationships can offer, especially which protective role a sibling relationship might have. It is also important that parents become more aware of how their children might experience certain parental behavior and what consequences this might have.","['differential parenting', 'sibling relationship', 'warmth', 'conflict', 'physical aggression', 'psychological aggression', 'sibling relationship quality', 'moderator']"
Sex differences in the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 intensive care survivors one year after discharge,"Peters, Danja","['Veldhuizen, J']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) have been identified in a significant portion of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors, with specifically higher prevalence in women. However, research regarding specific symptom cluster experience have been limited so far. Moreover, the prevalence of long-term PTSS in COVID-19 ICU survivors is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess sex differences in the prevalence of PTSS among COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ICU survivors one year after discharge. It was hypothesized that female ICU survivors have higher PTSS scores than male ICU survivors with specifically higher scores on symptom clusters C and D. Secondly, it was hypothesized that COVID-19 patients score higher on PTSS than non-COVID-19 patients, independent of the gender. Furthermore, it was explored whether COVID-19 patients score higher on any of the PTSS clusters. A prospective cohort study was conducted among a total of 217 ICU survivors at the Leiden University Medical Center. The follow-up assessment was administered one year after discharge using the PCL-5. The results of the two-way between-subjects analysis of variance showed a significant main effect for gender (p = .005), with females having higher PTSS scores than males. The results of the multivariate analysis of variance showed significant main effects for gender on clusters B (p = .001), C (p = .002) and E (p = .004), with females scoring higher on all these clusters. In addition, it was found that COVID-19 patients did not score higher than non- COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the main effect of COVID versus non-COVID patients for the sub symptom clusters was not significant for any sub symptom. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting that mainly female ICU survivors are more vulnerable to developing PTSS with specifically suffering more from cluster B, C and E. More awareness and recognition of sex differences may facilitate further treatment and direct screening for PTSS after ICU admission. It is of great importance to further study the long-term effects of COVID-19 to gain a clear understanding of its impact.","['PTSS, COVID-19, genderdifferences']"
Emotion Regulation Strategies and Emotional Arousal in Children with Sex Chromosome Trisomies,"Smit, Nikki","['Van Rijn, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Developmental Psychopathology in Education and Child Studies (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Individuals with sex chromosome trisomies (SCT’s) have an increased risk for psychopathologies and behavioral problems. Cognitive factors during development could underly the development of psychopathologies. Adults with an extra X chromosome (Klinefelter) showed impaired emotional arousal and emotion regulation. However, not much is known about the manifestation of these impairments in children with SCT’s. Therefore, the current study focused on emotional arousal and emotion regulation strategies in children with SCT’s. It was also investigated if age moderated the differences in emotional arousal and emotion regulation strategies. One hundred-seven children with SCT’s and 102 nonclinical controls participated in this study. A frustration inducing task (locked-box task) was used to induce heightened emotional arousal, which was measured continuously using heart rate measures. The emotion regulation strategies were coded during the task as well. Results showed lower emotional arousability in the children with SCT’s as well as less frequent use of constructive and venting emotion regulation strategies. The difference in avoidance strategy use was moderated by age. As the current study found evidence for the manifestation of emotion regulation problems in the childhood of individuals with SCT’s, it could be that these impairments are part of the underlying mechanism of the development of psychopathologies as well as possible targets for intervention.","['sex chromosome trisomies', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional arousal', 'emotion regulation strategies']"
Aanbod in adaptief en flexibel strategiegebruik in aftrekopgaven tot 100 in Nederlandse rekenmethoden van groep 4 en 5,"Boer, Fleur de",['T.M.M. Mostert (Terry)'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"This study investigated the stimulation of flexible and adaptive strategy use in lessons with classroom instruction with subtraction tasks up to 100 in the most commonly used Dutch arithmetic methods of group 4 and 5. Flexibility means using multiple strategies to solve a calculation task and adaptivity means choosing the optimal strategy for a calculation task. The purpose of the study was to identify the differences between traditional and realistic arithmetic methods in terms of flexible and adaptive strategy use. It was expected that realistic arithmetic methods will encourage students more in flexible and adaptive strategy use. A total of 288 lessons with classroom instruction were included in the study and analyzed using a self-designed codebook for strategy offerings and facilitators’ offerings for adaptivity. Facilitators’ offerings for adaptivity stimulate the adaptive strategy use. The analyses revealed that realistic arithmetic methods seem to stimulate students more in flexible and adaptive strategy use than traditional arithmetic methods. However, in the new versions of the realistic arithmetic methods, students seem to be less stimulated in flexible and adaptive strategy use compared to the old versions. A limitation is that only a small proportion of arithmetic methods were examined. Another limitation is that strategy supply in arithmetic methods is influenced by the way teachers teach and by the differential impact on students. Thus, strategy supply is not equal to students' strategy use. This research contributes to the research on flexible and adaptive strategy use in arithmetic methods and complements previous research. Schools could take this into account when choosing a new method or to supplement their math education so that students can be provided with a math method that fits the vision for math education.","['arithmetic methods, flexibility, adaptivity, subtraction']"

Reading motivation is of great importance in the development of reading comprehension skills. International tests shows that the reading skills and reading motivation of secondary school students has deteriorated in recent years. The aim of the current research is to examine the reading motivation of students in higher professional education and university. First, the influence of the Standard of Coherence on the reading comprehension level of students was investigated. The Standard of Coherence is a collective term for intrinsic reading motivation, extrinsic reading motivation, the desire to read difficult texts and the desire to understand texts. Secondly, it was investigated to what extent the Standard of Coherence differs between students in higher professional education and university. Participants were 47 Dutch students, of which 25 students from higher professional education and 22 students from university. All students completed a questionnaire as a measure of the reader's Standard of Coherence. In addition, the reading comprehension level of the students was determined by means of the inference test and CBM-Maze test. The results show that the individual elements of the Standard of Coherence as well as the Standard of Coherence itself are not significant predictors of the reading comprehension level. In addition, the results don’t show that the Standard of Coherence differs between students in higher professional education and university. Follow-up research should clarify the extent to which reading motivation decreases with the transition from secondary school to further education and the role of gender in the relationship between the Standard of Coherence and the reading comprehension level. Based on the current results, teachers are advised to continue to offer scientific literature in higher professional education and university in a comparable way as they are used to","['Reading comprehension, Standard of Coherence']"

De intrinsieke motivatie bij het vak rekenen, in vergelijking met andere schoolvakken, daalt het meest gedurende de schoolperiode. Daarom is in dit onderzoek gekeken in hoeverre autonomie, leeftijd en sekse de intrinsieke motivatie beïnvloeden van leerlingen in de bovenbouw tijdens de rekenles. Voor dit onderzoek hebben leerlingen uit groep 6, 7 en 8 van twee basisscholen meegewerkt. In totaal hebben 41 deelnemers met toestemming de vragenlijst ingevuld. In verband met de toen geldende COVID-19 maatregelen is de vragenlijst online afgenomen op hun eigen basisschool. Kijkend naar de resultaten is er een positieve samenhang gevonden tussen ervaren autonomie en de totale intrinsieke motivatie. Dus leerlingen die meer autonomie ervaren zijn meer intrinsiek gemotiveerd tijdens de rekenles. Er is geen samenhang gevonden tussen leeftijd en intrinsieke motivatie en tussen sekse en intrinsieke motivatie. Dit betekent dat in dit onderzoek intrinsieke motivatie niet afneemt met leeftijd en dat de daling bij intrinsieke rekenmotivatie niet eerder plaatsvindt bij meisjes dan bij jongens. Kijkend naar het gemiddelde op de subschalen, wordt er op de subschaal autonomie relatief lager gescoord. Het lijkt dat er ruimte is voor groei op het gebied van ervaren autonomie. Autonomie tijdens de rekenlessen verhogen kan door het bieden van keuzes tijdens de lessen, differentiëren, gerichte feedback geven, structuur bieden en aansluiten bij de belevingswereld van de kinderen.","['Intrinsieke motivatie, autonomie, zelfdeterminatietheorie, rekenen, bovenbouw, stage-environment fit theorie']"

Ook van de variabelen leeftijd en sekse is de samenhang met intrinsieke motivatie onderzocht. Het onderzoek is bij leerlingen van groep 6, 7 en 8 (N = 41) van twee Leidse basisscholen afgenomen middels een online vragenlijst in Qualtrics. Deze vragenlijst betreft de door Meijer et al.

De IMI vragenlijst stelt vragen over verschillende subschalen, waaronder autonomie. De resultaten van het onderzoek tonen dat autonomie significant positief samenhangt met intrinsieke rekenmotivatie. Verder tonen de resultaten dat de leeftijd een niet-significante negatieve samenhang heeft met betrekking tot intrinsieke rekenmotivatie. Daarnaast tonen de resultaten dat voor zowel jongens als meisjes de samenhang tussen leeftijd in jaren en maanden en intrinsieke rekenmotivatie niet significant blijkt.

To investigate these hypotheses, a quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted with a between-subjects design. The participants were asked to complete three questionnaires and two computer tasks to measure their cognitive flexibility, empathy, and trauma symptoms. Linear regression analyses showed that trauma was not a significant predictor of cognitive flexibility or empathy. If future studies could find this relationship in a larger sample, it possibly has implications for actively using cognitive flexibility and empathy as resilience factors during education for mental health professionals, therapeutic treatments of trauma, and in educational settings.","['trauma', 'PTSD', 'cognitive flexibility', 'empathy', 'Syrian refugee children']"

By focussing on the relation between emotional characteristics (e.g., certainty) and individual characteristics of personal agency (e.g., responsibility) the current study examined whether personal agency moderates the relationship between ideology and emotional preferences. Two hundred-forty participants from the UK engaged in a behavioural task which assessed emotional preferences and a series of questionnaires assessing participants ideology, personal agency and demographics. A regression analysis of fear preferences indicated that rightist more than leftists, are more motivated to regulate towards fear. In direct comparison of emotional preferences (guilt vs. pride), leftists were more motivated than rightists to regulate towards guilt compared to pride. Other emotional preferences were non-significant and the moderating role of personal agency could not be confirmed either. The study provides further insights into motivated emotion regulation and various implications for future in the context of reinforcing ideological beliefs.","['Ideology, Personal Agency, Emotion Regulation, Hope, Fear, Guilt, Pride']"
Effect of daylight saving time measured as impulse response in smartphone behavior,"Čuljak, Matija","['Ghosh, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Daylight Saving Time (DST) is at its height of controversy in Europe and around the world, as many countries are considering abolishing it. However, little is known about how DST impacts individuals in naturalistic, cognitively-engaging tasks. By using smartphone touchscreen timestamp data from 336 participants in combination with a system identification and impulse response fitting approach, we measured changes in smartphone interactions for 15 days before and 15 days after spring and autumn DST transitions recorded from 2018 to 2021. Our aim was to explore the effect of DST smartphone interactions, including how long DST transitions impact individuals, whether individuals show similarities in their DST responses, and whether age and gender explain differences in DST responses. We found that most individuals were impacted by DST transitions, with a median recovery period of 26 days, almost twice as long as prior estimates. Additionally, hierarchical clustering revealed that some individuals show similarities in their responses to DST, in addition to large inter-individual differences. We also found that differences in the DST response are not explained by age or gender. We propose that large inter-individual differences in responses to DST might be explained by the ability for individuals to self-select their sleep-wake patterns independently of day-night cycles. Additionally, these large inter-individual differences could partly explain the controversy behind DST, as further investigation needs to be made into what causes individuals to respond differently to DST.","['Daylight Saving Time', 'Smartphone', 'Behavioral Dynamics', 'Circadian Disruption', 'Impulse Response', 'System Identification', 'Age', 'Gender']"
Multidisciplinary treatment approach for patients with fibromyalgia: are general practitioners referring patients to physical and mental health care?,"Selter, Anna Katharina","['Kitselaar, W.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: Fibromyalgia is a disease constituted of both somatic and psychological symptoms. Prior research found that multidisciplinary treatment approaches are the most effective. The present study wants to elaborate whether general practitioners apply a multidisciplinary approach when referring patients with fibromyalgia to health care professionals. Design: An observational between-subject study has been conducted. The data used is taken from routine primary care databases of 82 general practices longitudinally. A patient group with depression acts as a control group to whom referral behaviour of general practices is compared. Participants: Patients who were older than 18, have had either a diagnosis of fibromyalgia or depression, and who were registered at their general practice at least one year were included (N=2443). Measures: Three outcome measures have been used: type of registration consisting of the two possible levels of fibromyalgia or depression, type of referral consisting of the three levels of mental health care, physical health care or both, and type of general practice consisting of 82 levels. Statistics: Descriptive and frequency tables have been evaluated regarding case numbers per type of registration, type of referral and general practice. Further, chi-square tests with Monte Carlo’s estimation of significance have been computed to analyse (in)dependence between registration type and referral type, and to analyse general practice-specific referral behaviour. Results: Of the fibromyalgia patient group, 2.6% received multidisciplinary referrals. Patients were referred to MHC less than to PHC. Patients with depression were referred to MHC in the majority of cases. Further, statistical significance has been found for a dependence between registration and referral type (p=<.001). Taking the different general practices into account, statistical significance has been found for a dependence between type of registration and general practice within the PHC referral sample (p=.01). Conclusion and implication: Multidisciplinary treatment seems to not always be facilitated by general practitioners even though previous research showed that it seems to be the best treatment option. Thus, a change in general practitioner’s referral behaviour might be needed. Future research should repeat the study with larger sample sizes per registration type to investigate general practices’ specific referral behaviour more in depth.","['fibromyalgia', 'multidisciplinary treatment', 'primary health care', 'mental health']"
The link between perceived parenting and adolescent negative affect in daily life: the moderating role of parental empathy.,"Raven, Mariska","['Janssen, L.H.C.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Parental criticism and a lack of parental warmth are associated with more internalizing problems and less overall well-being in adolescents. Negative affect could be an indicator for internalizing problems, but little is known about how fluctuations of perceived parental warmth and criticism of both mothers and fathers are linked to fluctuations of adolescent negative affect in daily life. The current study aimed to examine these daily micro-level processes. In addition, the moderating role of parental empathy (i.e. perspective taking and empathic concern) was investigated, as a lack of parental empathy is related to less warm parenting and more child psychopathology. The sample of this study consisted of 80 Dutch adolescents (29 boys and 51 girls) between 12-17 years old (M = 15.9) who completed four ecological momentary assessments per day for two consecutive weeks in which they reported their affect and perceived parenting. Their parents were asked to fill in a questionnaire to rate their level of empathy. Results from the multilevel regression analyses showed that, on average, adolescents experienced less negative affect on days when they perceived their mothers and fathers to be warmer and less critical. Furthermore, adolescents perceived their mothers to be more critical and warmer than their fathers. For both mothers and fathers, more parental empathic concern strengthened the negative association between daily parental warmth and daily negative affect. These findings could help clinical practice to better tailor preventive interventions in the field of psychopathology for adolescents and families.","['Ecological momentary assessment (EMA)', 'Daily life', 'Adolescent negative affect', 'Within-family level', 'Parental warmth', 'Parental criticism', 'Parental empathy']"
Maladaptive Repetitive Thinking and Stress: The Potential Impact on Late Adolescents and Young Adults,"Zamanis, Andreas","['Aksungur, U.S.', 'Ma, I.I.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"To date, a growing body of literature studies maladaptive repetitive thinking; an unproductive emotion regulation strategy, where a person engages in certain negative thoughts, that are maintained on a conscious state for a prolonged time period. Maladaptive repetitive thinking consists of different components, like worry and rumination. Researchers argue whether the two are actually distinct cognitive processes. Limited bibliography examined the relationship between maladaptive repetitive thinking and stress, which is why this study addresses this topic. Specifically, it investigates whether higher worry and rumination levels predict higher academic and general stress levels of undergraduate students, during an exam and a non-exam week. In addition, it is hypothesized that students will report higher academic and general stress levels during the exam week compared to the non-exam week. Lastly, we anticipate worry to be highly associated with rumination. Forty students during the non-exam week and twenty-eight during the exam week responded to the completion of self-report questionnaires, regarding worry, rumination, academic, and general stress. With the exception of general stress during the non-exam week, only increased rumination predicted increased levels of academic and general stress, during both weeks. Students reported higher general stress levels during the non-exam week compared to the exam week, whereas academic stress levels did not differ between the two weeks. As expected, worry highly correlated with rumination during both academic weeks, building on the literature in favor of this relationship. Our findings claim that, possibly, rumination is a stronger predictor of academic and general stress, compared to worry. Further exploration on how maladaptive repetitive thinking potentially affects the stress levels of students during different academic periods is needed. Limitations of the study are addressed and future directions are suggested.","['maladaptive repetitive thinking', 'worry', 'rumination', 'stress', 'academic stress', 'students']"
Trust in automated vehicles: The link between personality traits and self-reported trust in automated vehicles,"Wai, Myrthe Nymph",['Dr. F.

Studies have shown trust strongly affects behavior, acceptance, attitudes and perceived usefulness of technology. Personality traits could predict the likeliness of trust in technology. In this study, we investigated the link between personality traits and self-reported trust in automated vehicles. A total of 64 participants watched first-person driving simulation videos. There were two conditions (Perfect Vehicle and Poor Vehicle), each consisting of eight phases. In each phase, a driving video was shown followed by a questionnaire about trust. In the Perfect Vehicle condition videos demonstrated perfect driving behavior and one video demonstrated reckless driving behavior in the fourth Phase. In the Poor Vehicle condition all videos demonstrated reckless driving behavior. Participants reported higher trust levels when witnessing the perfect driving behavior and lower trust levels when witnessing reckless driving behavior. There were no differences in trust levels over time in the Poor Vehicle condition. Trust levels also decreased after witnessing a critical event (reckless driving behavior) after seeing perfect driving behavior, and improved when experiencing perfect driving behavior again. Results also indicated a strong negative correlation between Neuroticism and reported trust in the Perfect Vehicle condition. The higher participants scored on the Neuroticism scale of the BFI-10, the lower trust they reported in automated vehicles. These findings suggest reckless driving behavior can cause a decrease in trust and perfect driving behavior can repair this trust again. Findings also suggest that participants with higher Neuroticism report lower trust in automated vehicles.","['Trust in automation, Trust in automated vehicles, Automation, Personality and automation']"
The role of vascular reactivity in Alzheimer’s disease and its link with cognition,"Kauffman, Jessy","['Ruitenberg, M.F.L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Vascular damage, like cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is a comorbidity in the majority of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. Vascular reactivity has been introduced as a novel marker for vascular damage in CAA. It is measured as the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the visual cortex after visual stimulation. It may detect underlying vascular factors early in the disease, like in patients with subjective (SCI) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In these stages, SCI patients start to experience subjective cognitive complaints, whereas these can be objectified in MCI patients. The aim of this study is to measure and compare vascular reactivity in memory clinic patients and controls, and explore its association with cognition. We performed 3T MRI in 43 controls, 17 SCI, 20 MCI, and 12 AD patients and obtained 3D T1-weighted images, FLAIR, and visually stimulated BOLD fMRI scans. The main independent variable was patient group. Dependent variables were three vascular reactivity parameters time-to-peak, time-to-baseline, and amplitude of the BOLD response. Univariate linear models were performed to comparedifferences in vascular reactivity between memory clinic patients and controls, and separate patient groups and controls. Linear regression analyses were performed to explore the association between vascular reactivity and cognition. All analyses were corrected for age, gender, gray matter volume, white matter hyperintensities, and CAA. BOLD amplitudes were smaller in dementia and MCI (ps < .001), but not SCI patients (p = .77).Time-to-peak and time-to-baseline showed no differences between groups (ps > .07). Lower amplitude of the BOLD response was associated with poorer performance of global cognitive, memory, executive, and language functioning (ps < .04). Our findings demonstrate that dementia and MCI are associated with lower vascular reactivity, reflected as amplitude of the BOLD response. In our sample, lower vascular reactivity is also associated with poorer cognitive functioning. These results indicate that impaired vascular reactivity plays a key role early in dementia and is an independent contributor to cognitive decline. Potentially, vascular reactivity could be used as a marker for amyloid-beta and as an alternative way to quantify vascular damage. Ultimately, it could aid in the development of interventions focused on amyloid-beta removal and could serve as a marker for disease progression.","['Dementia', 'Alzheimer', 'CAA', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Vascular damage', 'Vascular reactivity', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive impairment', 'amyloid-beta', ""Alzheimer's disease""]"
The missing indicator method for response variables in binary transition models: A simulation study,"Barragan Ibañez, Camila Natalia",['Mark de Rooij'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Longitudinal data are often collected in different research areas such as medicine, biology, education, and psychology. We can build a transitional model using longitudinal binary data, which aims to model the probability of transition between the response categories. In this type of data is common to find missing values due to dropouts, costs, and organizational problems. The missing-indicator model is often used as a method to handle missing values in this type of data. This method consists in creating a new category for the missing values. Therefore, the binary logistic model changes to a baseline-category logit model. This study aims to evaluate the bias of the estimated coefficients when the missing-indicator method is used in the response of a binary transitional model. Based on an empirical example, a Monte Carlo simulation with three factors is carried out: (1) type of missingness, (2) sample size, and (3) proportion of missing data. The coefficients bias from the baseline-category logit model is evaluated using boxplots and a three-way MANOVA analysis. The results suggest that sample size, the proportion of missing data, type of missingness and the interaction between sample size and proportion affect the bias of the estimated coefficients; nonetheless, the effect size is small. When each dependent variable is analysed separately using ANOVA, the effects of the proportion of missing and the interaction between sample size and proportion were statistically significant for only one coefficient. However, the effect size is still small. Therefore, the conclusion is that the estimated coefficients' bias for all the missingness types is low.","['Missing indicator method', 'transitional models', 'longitudinal data', 'simulation study', 'missing data', 'bias', 'missing response', 'missing-indicator']"

Previous research has shown that a surprise enhances memory, but not much is known about the cognitive mechanisms underlying this effect. Therefore, the current research investigated whether different strengths of surprise (mild or strong) or different directions of surprise (positive or negative) differentially influence memory. Based on the literature it was hypothesized that positive rather than negative and stronger rather than weaker surprises are better remembered. Moreover, it was investigated whether the emotional valence (positive or negative) of an image has an effect on memory. Participants (N = 25) undertook a recognition memory experiment with emotionally valent images spanning over three phases. Thereby participants encountered surprises of different strengths and of different directions. Based on the participants responses it was determined which level of surprise had the biggest effect on memorization and whether emotional valence had an effect. The results showed a significant interaction of the strength and direction of surprise. The interaction indicated that images associated with no surprise and images associated with strong negative surprise were significantly better remembered than images associated with a strong positive or a mild negative surprise. Furthermore, it was found that negative images are more frequently correctly recognized than positive images. Overall, the results of the study showed that only a strong negative surprise enhances memory for associated images but that also no surprise at all led to better memory. These findings can be of great relevance in education and learning research.",

Rover'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Worry and anxiety are associated with an increase in absolute heart rate, while heart rate variability decreases. Low heart rate variability is associated with an active anterior insula. A hyperactive anterior insula is observed in individuals with anxiety disorders. However, it is not yet known whether a hyperactive anterior insula makes a person vulnerable to developing anxiety disorders or whether the anterior insula becomes hyperactive as a result of the disorder. Therefore, this study aims to investigate these associations in healthy participants. The following research questions were asked, ""Is there a correlation between absolute heart rate and trait worry?"" and ""Is trait worry associated with low heart rate variability?"" the same questions are posed in the context of anxiety. Finally, the question ""Is trait anxiety associated with a hyperactive insula?"" is asked. To examine this, data from the HADS, PSWQ, vectorcardiogram measures of heart rate and the heart rate variability, and the functional connectivity of the salience network from the 30 female participants were used. Results show no significant relationship between absolute heart rate, heart rate variability, and trait worry and anxiety in healthy participants. A significant relationship between the functional connectivity in the anterior insula and trait anxiety was found in our sample (r = .42, p = <.05). The effects of worry and anxiety on cardiac activity are mainly seen in clinically diagnosed individuals under an unpredictable and uncontrollable stressful environment. Our sample were healthy individuals, so symptoms were apparently not severe enough. The effects of trait anxiety are directly reflected in brain connectivity in the anterior insula observed in our analysis. The results can be applied to treatments reducing anxiety and worry.","['Heart rate variability', 'brain axis', 'trait worry', 'trait anxiety']"

"The ""confidence vs. trust hypothesis"" - Is Gender a potential moderator?","Simon, Yara","['van der Ham, I. C.J.M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. In our daily lives, we trust automation more and more often. The ""confidence vs. trust hypothesis"" states that trust in automation subtracted by self-confidence (T-SC ratio) predicted the use of automation. However, no studies investigate a potential link to gender, which is relevant since self-confidence in spatial abilities is mainly higher in males. The current research investigates the ""confidence vs. trust hypothesis"" for self-confidence in spatial abilities and trust in automation like GPS/Google Maps. Moreover, we examined gender as a potential moderator of the relation between the T-SC ratio and automation use and gender differences in trust in automation and self-confidence. Method. Participants (N = 150, Mage= 27.11, 52 males and 98 females) indicated their frequency of GPS/Google Maps use per week (use of automation). Further, their self-confidence in spatial abilities was measured with an ad-hoc questionnaire and trust automation on two subscales of the Trust in Automation Scale. Afterwards, we calculated the T-SC ratio for each participant. Results. There was no correlation between T-SC ratio and use of automation (r (150) = .015, p = .857). Thus, we could not conduct a moderation analysis with gender as the moderator. Nevertheless, one-way ANOVAs revealed females’ lower levels of self-confidence in their spatial abilities compared to males (F (1, 148) = 8.613, p =0.004, η2= 0.055), but no significant difference between females and males for in trust in automation (F (1, 148) = 0.079, p =0.780, η2=0.001). Conclusion. The current research indicated no relation between the T-SC ratio and the use of automation. Moreover, there were gender differences in confidence in spatial abilities but not trust in automation. Gender was no moderator due to the lack of correlation in the ""confidence vs. trust hypothesis""; thus, there might be no potential differences between females and males. However, future studies should further examine gender differences in the ""confidence vs. trust hypothesis"" with, for example, an experimental design.",
Changes in Psychological Intimate Partner Violence against Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Biriz, Bikem","['Molendijk, M.L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Previous studies indicated that victims of intimate partner violence, usually women, are now exposed to perpetrators more during the pandemic, which is a period of unusual psychological and financial pressure with limited access to help services. But, no systematic synthesis of evidence of its psychological effect has been undertaken. Aim: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to estimate the magnitude of pandemic-driven restrictions on the prevalence of psychological IPV rates among women. Method: Articles on IPV against women were searched up to August 18, 2021 using the electronic PubMed and Web of Science databases. The selected studies needed to meet certain criteria. Mixed-effects meta-analysis was performed. This study was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Results: A total of 28 empirical studies that met general inclusion criteria were yielded in the meta-analysis after several rounds of the elimination process (N=54711). Results showed that 22.62% of women were exposed to psychological violence by their intimate partners. The prevalence rate of psychological IPV before the pandemic was 24.78%, whereas it was 17.27% during COVID-19. These prevalence rates of psychological IPV showed no statistically significant difference ( t(26) = -0.373, p = 0.713). Conclusion: The pandemic was not associated with the changes in psychological IPV incidence estimates. However, limited access to emergency services during the pandemic and fear of victims asking for help might have been barriers to reporting the violence. Thus, further research and policy attention are needed. The meta-analysis had many limitations, most apparently publication bias, so it is suggested that the findings be evaluated with this notice.","['Intimate partner violence', 'psychological violence', 'IPV', 'COVID-19', 'meta-analysis', 'systematic review']"
Placebo and cognitive enhancement: the cognitive and neurological effects of conditioning and verbal suggestion,"Hiralal, Kamil","['van Elk, M']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Previous research has shown that subjective cognitive performance can be enhanced, and that sense of agency can be lowered via verbal suggestion of brain stimulation. Mixed results have been found on the effect of placebo stimulation on error-related negativity (ERN) amplitude, which is an implicit outcome measure. This EEG study focused on the role of verbal suggestion and associative learning in eliciting placebo effects in subjective performance, sense of agency, and ERN amplitude. Using a within-subject design, we recorded EEG while participants (n = 19) performed in a simple cognitive task. Participants were told that a sham brain stimulation device would either enhance (placebo condition) or impair (nocebo condition) their cognitive performance. Next, we used a conditioning phase in which we altered the task difficulty according to the experimental block in order to induce the association between task difficulty and proposed stimulation. After this conditioning phase, the task difficulty was equal across conditions. We found increased subjective performance in the nocebo condition, but not the placebo condition, compared to control. We found a lower sense of agency in the placebo condition, but not the nocebo condition, compared to control. Finally, we found no difference in ERN amplitude throughout conditions. These results are not in line with previous research. Our conditioning phase did not work as intended and therefor the results are difficult to interpret. In addition, based on the results of our post-test questionnaire, our verbal suggestion might have been too weak. Future research should try to replicate the earlier results and continue investigating possible (other) implicit outcome measures.","['Placebo/Nocebo effects', 'Subjective performance', 'Sense of agency', 'Verbal Suggestion', 'Associative learning']"

Dutch Regional Cooperation in EU-Lobby Affairs: The Case of the Just Transition Fund,"Kelderman, Yorne Pieter Adrian Y.P.A.","['Otjes, S.P.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Utilizing the case of the JTF and Dutch provinces, this thesis inquires the main research question on which factors contribute to Dutch regional cooperation in EU-affairs. Extracting from the theoretical framework and literature, two hypotheses based on party-political congruence and interest compatibility are formulated. The analysis of party-political congruence and executive overlap as determinant shows that there are big differences in the level of congruence between provincial regions of The Netherlands. However, the analysis likewise shows that party-political congruence solely attributes little to the extend of regional cooperation in EU-affairs. This resulted in the determinant of party-political congruence being refuted. However, when we reformulate and add the dimensions of party ideology, executive (party) network and coalition agreements to the equation, political congruence increases in validity as supporting factor for regional cooperation. The analysis of interest compatibility shows that that there are significant differences in the degree of interest compatibility between different provinces within different regions in The Netherlands. This variation results in significant different outcomes when it come to regional cooperation in EU-affairs. Hence, interest compatibility is accepted as determinant factor. When further scrutinizing, it appears that social, economic and geographical provincial characteristics are important conditions for interest compatibility. In conclusion to the thesis' main question, it’s the compatibility of provincial interests and proactive executives which are the drivers behind regional cooperation. When provinces are characteristically alike, have well-connected executives, pro-European parties in the regional assemblies and European funds maintain well-defined criteria, regional cooperation can be a logical phenomenon in The Netherlands.","['Paradiplomacy', 'EU-Lobby', 'European Union', 'European Studies', 'International Relations', 'Regional Cooperation', 'The Netherlands', 'Interreg', 'Fund Allocation', 'Regionalism']"
Burnout in Higher Education Students: Examining the Effectiveness of Burnout Prevention Interventions on Burnout Symptoms and Perceived Stress Based on Study Backgrounds. A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Dreissig, Pauline","['Tona, D. K.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous studies show an alarming increase in burnout in university students, yet there is a surprising lack of research regarding their burnout prevention. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of burnout prevention interventions on perceived stress and burnout in higher education. It was hypothesised that prevention interventions are effective in reducing burnout and stress, and that study background acts as a moderator. This study was a continuation of past research at Leiden University. Of the dataset, extracted in 2019, 12 studies met the following eligibility criteria: containing (1) an intervention aimed at reducing burnout in (2) residency, university, or college, (3) a burnout-outcome, and (4) were written in English, Dutch, or Greek. Qualitative results suggest that burnout prevention interventions are successful in reducing burnout and stress in the student population. Effects included reduced stress, increased relaxation, and stress-management skills. Quantitative outcomes showed burnout prevention interventions reduced stress (intervention-control: Hedges’ g 0.56, p=0.008; pre-post: Hedges’ g 0.7; p=0.004), but not burnout (intervention-control: Hedges’ g 0.12, p=0.55; pre-post: Hedges’ g 0.17, p=0.42). Study background, especially education, significantly moderated stress (Hedges’ g 0.7; p<0.001) making the interventions more effective. However, the background was not a significant moderator for burnout (Hedges’ g 0.16; p=0.36). Since stress is a precursor of burnout, the interventions could potentially prevent early-stage burnout. Further research on burnout prevention at different symptom severity is strongly suggested. This study is the first step into preventing burnout prematurely by giving students tools to detect and counteract its warning signs.","['burnout prevention intervention', 'burnout symptoms', 'perceived stress', 'higher education', 'students']"

Evaluaties van emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen: Een replicatie,"Chan, Aren WK",['Wouter Boekel'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Emotional facial expressions are considered to be one of the most important aspects of social interactions. Facial expressions are formed by specific facial muscle activity. Each individual facial muscle is called an Action Unit (AU). The open-source toolkit OpenFace uses algorithmic analyses to detect the AU’s, which are trained on Ekman’s basic emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. Previous studies on evaluations of emotional facial expressions have mainly used acted facial expressions. However, little research has been published on spontaneous facial expressions and the difference in evaluations of facial expressions between men and women. The aim of this study was to gain more insights into the evaluation of spontaneous expressions and gender differences involved in these evaluations. The current study analyzed the correlation between OpenFace evaluations and participant evaluations of (semi-)spontaneous facial expressions and the gender differences in the evaluations. Using an online survey, 72 participants evaluated videos of (semi-)spontaneous emotional facial expressions based on the six basic emotions. The results of MultiLevel Modeling demonstrated a significant correlation between the evaluations of OpenFace and the participants. There were no significant gender differences found within the evaluations. The expectations of this study were partly confirmed. The findings of this study indicate that further research is needed to investigate the alternative AU combinations that may be present in (semi-) spontaneous emotional facial expressions as well as the influence of gender differences.","['Facial expressions, emotional recognition, OpenFace, gender differences, gender, basic emotions, Action Units, FACS']"
De kwetsbaarheid van adolescenten met een jeugdtrauma tijdens de coronapandemie,"Pondman, Lili","['Harmelen, A-L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic and its restrictions may have far-reaching consequences for mental health among adolescents with experiences of childhood adversities (CA). Exposure to CA influences information processing such as threat processing and reward processing and is therefore associated with elevated risk for psychopathology partly due to altered patterns of social functioning. We propose that adolescents with CA may experience loneliness due to the COVID-19 restrictions and that experiencing loneliness can depend on exposure to deprivation and threat because of its distinct effects on neurological development. Methods: We recruited adolescents (N = 79, 𝑀𝑎𝑔𝑒= 22,4, SD = 2,645) from the Resilience after Individual Stress Exposure (RAISE) who filled in a questionnaire of experienced Childhood Adversities before the lockdown. We measured loneliness during the first lockdown (April 2020), the relaxation of restrictions (July 2020) and the reintroduced restrictions (October 2020). The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) measured Childhood adversities and the Revised University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale (R-UCLA) measured loneliness. Results: The findings showed that loneliness in April, July and October did not change (F(1.906, 131.508) = .187, p > .05). Loneliness and experiences of threat did not interact with each other; reported loneliness was not influenced by experiences of threat (F(1.906, 131.508) = .282, p > .05). Loneliness and experiences of deprivation did not interact with each other; loneliness was not influenced by experiences of deprivation (F(1.906, 131.508) = .237, p > .05). There was an association between loneliness (April) and neglect (β = .1.18 (t (74) = 3.73; p < .001, r=.56), but no association between loneliness and threat (β = .005 (t) (74) = .017; p > .05). Discussion: The corona pandemic is characterized by an unpredictable situation, which may have caused feelings of fear and anxiety for the entire population which resulted in solidarity; the virus could affect anyone. This could explain the absence of association between threat and loneliness as well as the absence of difference in loneliness in April, July and October.","['Childhood adversities', 'deprivation', 'threat', 'COVID-19', 'loneliness']"
The Effectiveness of Self-Awareness Interventions for Children: Do Social-Economic Status & Age Play a Role? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Vică, Cristiana","['Tona, D.K.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on self-awareness (SA) as a powerful tool in the ability to identify and manage psychological reactions in the face of uncertainty. Prior research supports early SA development as key to setting the right trajectory for lifelong socio-emotional growth in children. Existing reviews have yet to examine interventions specifically targeting SA skills. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to address this gap by examining the effectiveness of SA interventions alongside components contributing to the improvement in children. Age and socioeconomic status (SES) were examined as plausible factors moderating SA intervention effectiveness. The dataset was extracted in 2019 based on keyword searches of eight electronic databases. In addition to SA components, secondary outcomes of positive, (i.e., prosocial skills) and negative (i.e., emotional distress) mental health were evaluated. Forty-two studies examining SA interventions targeted for children below 13 years in all settings were included, with 29 studies included in the meta-analysis. Results showed that SA interventions had an overall small to moderate effect on all outcomes (g= .32, 95% CI [.20, .44], p< .001). Small but considerable gains were found on the majority of the SA components: emotional competence, self-efficacy, selfesteem, and interpersonal relationships (mean g= .26). The largest effects were found for emotional competence (g= .53) and self-efficacy (g= .48). Age and SES were not found to moderate effects on SA outcomes. In conclusion, interventions were successful in fostering positive changes in children’s SA. Further research is needed to explore intervention characteristics influencing SA development.","['children', 'self-awareness', 'self-concept', 'socio-emotional', 'SEL interventions.']"

Learning from Complications: a pilot study on the quality of learning strategies in a hospital.,"Metkemeijer, Margot","['Groeneweg, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"One in every ten hospitalized patients suffers from an unintended or undesirable outcome of treatment, often referred to as complications. Organizations in healthcare need to learn from these events to prevent recurrences and improve patient safety. However, the methods used to learn from these complications do not appear to have the desired effect, evident from the absence of a decrease in complications. To improve learning processes, it is necessary to know which steps hamper the learning process, thereby hindering optimal learning. For this pilot study the theoretical framework ‘Learning from Incidents Process’ (LFIP) (Drupsteen et al., 2013) is introduced in the healthcare domain. Originally the framework was developed for the (non-healthcare) industry to identify bottlenecks that inhibit learning processes and to get an indication of the use of learning potential throughout the process. The model is renamed as ‘Learning from Complications Process’ (LFCP) to fit the healthcare context. With this study the LFCP-model is introduced and applied in a hospital setting, aiming to answer the following research questions (1) Are the steps in the LFCP formally arranged and executed at Hospital X and how well do they work according to the medical staff? (2) At what steps in the LFCP does the medical staff experience bottlenecks, that hamper the learning process and its outcomes? (3) To what extent does psychological safety influence this learning process? The internal consistency of the LFCP-questionnaire was tested on an M-Turk sample of healthcare employees, to justify use within a healthcare setting. To answer the hypotheses, a mixed-methods design is applied. The data for this study were gathered by use of online questionnaires (N = 6), semi-structured interviews (N = 3) and online observations (N = 13). It is expected to find results indicating sub-optimal use of learning potential, and a diversity of bottlenecks throughout the LFCP. Results showed a significant decline in formally arranged, executed and quality of executed steps throughout the LFCP. Consequently, the use of learning potential followed this line of decline, with the biggest loss of learning potential at the evaluation stage. Bottlenecks were identified after stage 1 ‘Understanding causation’. However, no correlation was found between psychological safety and the LFCP. These results indicate that there is ample room to improve the quality of the learning processes, implying that patient safety can be further enhanced by improving the quality of total learning processes. For the future the LFCP-model can be used as a tool to quantify results of interventions to improve the quality of learning processes. Because of the small sample size this pilot study is a proof of concept. Therefore, no hard inferences can be drawn, and results should be treated with the utmost caution.","['patient safety', 'complication', 'quality of learning process', 'psychological safety', 'organizational culture']"

Furthermore, the gender differences in the level of social interactions were assessed. A total of 216 primary school children participated in this research with a mean age of 10.5 years (SD = .94). Correlations were found for peer nominations (mutual nominations and best friend nominations) with self-reported sense of integration and percentage time interacting (sensor data). No other correlations appeared. Moreover, when testing for possible gender differences in the level of social interactions, girls reported feeling more peer intimacy (less lonely in the context of intimate friendships) when compared to boys. This was the only gender difference found in this research. Taking everything in consideration, it is sensible that primary education focuses on social interactions and loneliness since friendship is a crucial part of a child’s development. However, schools could still focus more on gender differences in social interactions and loneliness. Furthermore, based on this research outcomes, some questions arise about (non)-existing gender differences and differences with existing literature. This indicates the need for more in-depth research in the future.","['social interactions', 'loneliness', 'sensors', 'gender differences']"
The Effect of Susceptibility to Sleep Deprivation on 6df Docking Performance: An Experimental Study,"Kalkoffen, Lennard Jeremy","['Mühl, C.', 'Piechowski, S.M.', 'Habers, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Operations in space are anything but restful for astronauts, as there are both physical and psychological stressors. One known stressor is the lack of sufficient sleep in space which can drastically impact astronauts’ performance. Successful docking is highly important during space missions since small mistakes can lead to disastrous consequences. The docking process can be trained with the 6df task, a simulation in which six degrees of freedom must be controlled. This experimental study aimed to investigate the effect of susceptibility to sleep deprivation (SSD) on 6df docking performance impairment due to sleep deprivation (SD). A total of 62 participants (28 female; 18-39 years, Mage = 24.84; SDage = 4.69) completed a balanced-repeated-measures-cross-over-total-SD design. Test variables were calculated by subjects’ performance differences between “well-rested-“ and “SD measurements”. The dependent variable docking performance impairment due to SD was operationalised by 6df outcomes(“top-level achieved” and “mean docking accuracy”). SSD was defined as 1/reaction time (RT) from the Psychomotor Vigilance Test. A background analysis showed that participants’ RT slows significantly when SD (p < .001). Multinomial regressions (“top-level achieved”) showed no significant relations between SSD and docking performance impairment, whereas multiple regressions (“mean docking accuracy”) showed significant relations (p < .001). Post-hoc analysis showed that testing order is noteworthy because participants assessed in the order “well-rested-“ followed by “SD measurements” have lower docking performance impairment due to SD than the group with reversed order. Further, a posthoc analysis showed when participants split in “least SSD” and “most SSD”, the effect of SSD on 6df docking performance impairment due to SD was affected by testing order. The importance of testing order suggests the presence of a learning effect, meaning that docking performance impairment due to SD could be reduced by exhaustive training in well-rested conditions. In conclusion, this study can help construct guidelines for determining whether an individual can still perform the operationally relevant task safely under SD. This could also be interesting for other professions such as submarines, pilots, and surgeons, in which six degrees of freedom have to be controlled under SD.","['Space', 'Docking Performance Impairment', '6df', 'Sleep-Deprivation', 'Susceptibility', 'PVT']"

Development of empathy: the role of parental sensitivity,"Diest, Anne van",['Simone Dobbelaar'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Empathy is important for social, cognitive and emotional development in children. Therefore, it is of great value to know what might enhance this development. The current study was designed to examine the development of empathy in children. In addition, the influence of parental sensitivity on empathy (over time) was examined. Parental sensitivity is the ability of the caregiver to understand and respond in an adequate manner to the needs of the child. In this longitudinal study, children were tested with their primary parent for three years, starting when the children were 8 / 9 years old (T1: N = 155, T2: N = 129). Results show a stable level of empathy at the transition from 8 - 9 year olds to 9 - 10 year olds. A decrease was shown at the age of 10 - 11. No significant correlation or interaction over time was found between sensitive parenting and empathy. This indicates that an intervention aimed at enhancing parental sensitivity might not be necessary for the development of higher levels of empathy. Future research should view the three different layers of empathy separately, to see if parental sensitivity has an influence on the different layers of empathy.","['Children, empathy, parental sensitivit']"
Development of PTSD symptoms after childhood trauma and the mediating role of distress tolerance,"Qadri, Dana Syed","['Kooistra, M.J. + de Kleine, R.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Childhood trauma is still prevalent globally as well as in the Netherlands. Approximately 3% of children in the Netherlands had experienced a form of abuse in 2017. Childhood trauma is associated with mental illnesses, among which chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Simultaneously, previous research has shown associations between low distress tolerance and PTSD symptoms, and low distress tolerance and childhood trauma. Aim: The aim of the current study is to investigate the mediating role of distress tolerance on the relationship between childhood trauma and PTSD symptoms. Method: To conduct our mediation analysis, we collected data through an online questionnaire from 169 adults who had experienced a traumatic or stressful experience or event in their lifetime. Exclusion criteria were that they were diagnosed with a mental disorder and/or they were currently receiving any treatment. We conducted the mediation analysis in PROCESS by Hayes (2013). Results: Our results showed a partial mediation of distress tolerance on the relationship between childhood trauma and PTSD symptoms. We also found that childhood trauma is negatively associated with distress tolerance and that distress tolerance is negatively associated with PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: We conclude that distress tolerance explains part of the relationship between childhood trauma and PTSD symptoms. We suggest future research to look more into this relationship as the new knowledge adds to the literature about the onset of PTSD symptoms and could have implications for the prevention and intervention of PTSD symptoms.","['distress tolerance, emotion regulation, PTSD symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder, childhood trauma, childhood adversities.']"

Since speaking up is an important factor for learning and improvement, this study aimed to examine the status of psychological safety among healthcare workers at the Dutch hospital. To address current problems surrounding staff shortage in healthcare, we additionally aimed to investigate how healthcare workers could be retained to their hospital work environment. This pilot study researched the relationship between perceived organizational support (POS), psychological safety, and affective organizational commitment (AOC). Drawing on previous theories, we hypothesized and examined a mediator model predicting AOC. A mixed-method design was used for an in-depth understanding of POS, AOC, and psychological safety among healthcare professionals (N = 38) of a Dutch hospital. The data was collected through a survey, online observations during team meetings, and three interviews. This study provides new support to the importance of POS for organizational commitment. Results showed that POS increased psychological safety among healthcare professionals. Adding to the literature, it was found that in particular support from team leaders was important for higher levels of psychological safety. Our findings also indicate that POS has a positive impact on AOC, but this was not mediated by psychological safety. More research is required to better understand how POS exactly contributes to AOC. Based on our findings, we recommend including perceived support from team leaders within further research on psychological safety.","['Affective organizational commitment', 'Patient safety', 'Organizational learning', 'Psychological safety', 'Perceived organizational support', 'Perceived team leader support']"
Peer attachment and prosocial giving behaviour of highly intelligent children in regular and gifted education,"Meeren, Dennis van der","['Zanolie, C.K.K. + Keskinel, D.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study examined whether highly intelligent children experience stronger peer attachment and if they show more prosocial giving behaviour when attending gifted education as opposed to regular primary education. To examine the relation between peer attachment, prosocial giving behaviour and education type 117 Dutch students between 9 and 12 years old have filled in the Raven Progressive Matrices, the IRI, the Prosocial Donation Task and the IPPA as part of the Brightwave study. The results show that there is no significant effect of education type on peer attachment in highly intelligent children (t(1) = .102, p = .751). Furthermore, no significant effect of education type was found on prosocial giving behaviour (t(44) = .562, p = .577). We did find a significant effect of peer attachment on the number of donated coins F(2,88) = 10.543, p = .002. However, this effect was not influenced by education type. The results from this study were unexpected because previous research has shown that highly intelligent children differ from their classmates in terms of emotional development and playstyle (Kroesbergen et al., 2016). This could make them feel less familiar towards their classmates which would cause them to show less prosocial giving behaviour (Amici, 2015). A possible explanation why highly intelligent children do not experience higher peer attachment or show more prosocial giving behaviour in gifted education is that they do not differ as much from their classmates in regular education as previously thought or despite this difference they may still befriend some classmates that share their interests and playstyle.","['children', 'prosocial', 'peer attachment', 'gifted', 'highly intelligent', 'empathy']"
Reducing cyclists' red light running behavior with an intelligent traffic management system,"Letzer, Jamy","['Korving, J.', 'Band, G.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"A quarter of Dutch cyclists participate in the hazardous behavior of red light running (RLR). Studies show cyclists make a predictive mental model about the traffic situation. The behavioral outcome of the prediction is possibly influenced by the experienced cognitive load and internal risk arousal optimum. A mismatch between the cyclists' predicted traffic situation and traffic signal indication might partially explain RLR. The main aim of this research is to investigate whether an Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) lowers this mismatch via tracking, prioritization and optimalisation. It is hypothesized that these features increase safety by preventing situations that induce RLR. Cross-sectional observational research is performed by combining Loop-based sensor data with Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM) to identify the 154 CAM app cyclists from other cyclists on the Dutch N14-N44 intersection from May till July 2021. Cyclists with a smartphone-based application automatically send CAM messages to enhance the ITMS anticipatory modeling and receive prioritization. Based on the multinomial, Firth and Binary logistic regressions, cyclists with CAM-functionality have significantly reduced odds of encountering potentially unsafe situations, red lights, and show less RLR behavior. Therefore, it is concluded that the use of CAM communication and prioritization for cyclists is correlated with an improvement in cycling safety on a signalized intersection. However, methodological limitations and unsafe behavior remain. Future research could further target RLR by also targeting trust with CAM mediated smart system feedback, potentially increasing compliance of a red signal outcome.","['Red-light running', 'risk-taking behavior', 'cyclists', 'signalized intersection', 'decision dilemma']"

As emphasised by the World Health Organisation, suicide is preventable. Early identification of those at risk of suicide is essential to provide suitable care. Previous research has shown that those who have experienced adverse life events are at a greater risk of suicide. The Icelandic Model for Primary Prevention of Substance Abuse (IPM) is a pioneering preventative model. The main goal of this model is to prevent substance abuse in Icelandic youths. One major aspect of the IPM is community-building. Community building has shown to be able to aid in not only preventing substance abuse, but suicidality as well, as social isolation is a risk factor for suicidality. This study attempted to assess how youth suicidality, negative life events, and community support interconnect, and whether this relationship is the same in the Netherlands and Iceland. Results showed a significant relationship between negative life events and suicidal thoughts in youths. In the Netherlands, a small moderating effect of community support on this relationship was found; this was not found in Iceland. The relationship between negative life events, suicidal thoughts and community support is different in the two countries. This means that from this research, there is not enough data to support the idea that the IPM could help significantly reduce youth suicidality in the Netherlands through increased community support.

Onderzoek naar het verband tussen genderstereotypering bij ouders en internaliserend probleemgedrag van kinderen met gendervariante gevoelens.,"Apperloo, Femke",['Peter Bos'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Previous empirical studies suggest that children who don’t feel the freedom to explore another gender identity, develop more internalizing problems. Transgender youth tend to rapport higher ratings of internalizing problems then their gender conforming peers. Despite these findings, limited information is available about the role that parents fulfill concerning this process, even though they are a prominent factor when it comes to the developmental processes of their children. This study investigates if parental gender stereotyping is connected to internalizing problems among children with genderfluid feelings. The study included 25 parent and child pairs. Results indicate that levels of explicit gender stereotyping aren’t related to gender stereotyping among raising the children. An important possible explanation for this non-significant result concerns the sample size, which was underpowered and could have missed a small effect. Second, there was no significant connection found between gender stereotyping among raising the children and the amount in which these children experienced internalizing problems. The findings indicate that there might be a social bias among the participants, considering that gender is a controversial subject. Therefore, this study can be seen as a foundation to the next step in gender diverse research for measuring parental gender stereotyping implicitly. Finally, this research underlines the concern to extend the empirical information about the parental role within the higher risk of negative developmental outcomes for children with gender diverse feelings.","['Gender, Stereotyping, Parental, Children, Internalizing problems']"

The Influence of Work Breaks on the Choice of Recovery Activities mediated by End-of-Workday Fatigue: a diary study,"Pluilaart, Romke","['de Wijn, A. N.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Mental fatigue and burnout are an increasing problem within the current working population, prompting research to get a clearer understanding of how individuals can successfully recover. The current study examined recovery at work (i.e., frequency of breaks) and end-of-workday fatigue as predictors of the engagement in two different types of leisure recovery activities (i.e., passive versus active). Based upon the Effort-Recovery Model and Conservation of Resources theory, it was hypothesized that high end-of-workday fatigue would lead to more engagement in passive recovery activities (e.g., watching television) and less engagement in active recovery activities (e.g., working out, meeting up with friends). In addition, a greater frequency of work breaks was expected to lead to less end-of-workday fatigue. Lastly, it was predicted that end-of-workday fatigue acted as a mediator in the relationship between frequency of breaks and type of recovery activity. Data was gathered through a diary study with three daily surveys (i.e., morning, afternoon, evening). Only participants who had worked at least 7.5 hours and had filled in the afternoon and evening survey on that same day were included in the study (N = 53). Results from the study show that frequency of breaks does not predict end-of-workday fatigue. Also, end-of-workday fatigue in turn does not predict the type of recovery activities that are pursued. Consequently, no support is found for end-of-workday fatigue as a mediator between frequency of breaks and type of recovery activities. Due to possible sampling bias, the findings from this study should be interpreted with caution. Future research should try to repeat the current study with a more heterogeneous sample, to know whether the current findings hold true.","['Work Recovery', 'Work Breaks', 'Choice of Recovery Activities', 'End-of-Workday Fatigue']"

"Uncontrollably Thinking About the Nights Ahead: Academic stress, attentional control, maladaptive repetitive thinking and sleep","Hoepel, Tatyana","['Aksungur, S.U.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Negative cognitive activity such as maladaptive repetitive thinking is not only experienced by individuals with a mental disorder, but also by the general population. However, not many studies on this phenomenon include non-clinical samples, which causes a moderate gap in the field of research. This study focuses on the general student population to examine the relationship between academic stress, attentional control, maladaptive repetitive thinking, and sleep difficulty in an attempt to bridge the current gap. Previous research findings indicate a close link between these variables, as well as detrimental consequences when they play a significant role in one’s life. Methods: This study incorporated online survey data from 50 students of Leiden University to investigate the associations between academic stress, attentional control, maladaptive repetitive thinking, and sleep difficulty. Results: An increase in perceived academic stress predicted an increase in maladaptive repetitive thinking, while a decrease in attentional control capacity predicted an increase in maladaptive repetitive thinking. An increase in perceived academic stress and poor attentional control together predicted an increase in maladaptive repetitive thinking. And lastly, an increase in maladaptive repetitive thinking did not predict an increase in experienced sleep difficulty. Discussion: Limitations include a small sample size that decreases this study’s generalizability. However, this study contributes to information that brings awareness to the detrimental effects of maladaptive repetitive thinking. Conclusion: This study should inform people on the importance of providing the general (student) population with interventional strategies to potentially protect them against the consequences of maladaptive repetitive thinking.","['Academic stress', 'Attentional control', 'Maladaptive repetitive thinking', 'Sleep difficulty']"
“Stop Right There!”: The Effect of Pausing Video Evidence on the Perceived Intent of Suspects,"Teichmann, Lars",['Lotte F. van Dillen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Previous research indicates that the way how video evidence is presented can affect how much intent viewers ascribe suspects. With this between-subjects online study, I investigated whether pausing video evidence leads viewers to ascribe greater premeditated intent to the suspect. Further, I assessed whether this effect may arise because viewers perceive that the suspect had more time to deliberate and/or because the pause makes the deliberation moment more readily available in memory. All participants (N = 169, Mage = 21.95) were shown video evidence of a crime. The video paused either immediately before the crime, far before the crime, or did not pause. Subsequently, they judged the intent of the suspect, and suggested a charge and sentence length that the suspect should serve in detention. Results indicated that pausing video evidence did not lead viewers to ascribe greater intent to the suspect nor to demand a more severe charge. Moreover, pausing video evidence did not lead viewers to perceive that the suspect had more time to deliberate about the crime. However, the pause made the moment of deliberation more readily available in memory. Further, participants who ascribed greater intent to the suspect also demanded longer imprisonment of the suspect. This study provided preliminary insights for policymaking on how to present evidence unbiased for factfinding in court and to ensure fairer legal processes.",
Psychosocial and Attachment problems in single born twins,"Bekkum, Sanne van","['Janssen, L. H.

Research has shown there is an association between losing a co-twin during or right after birth and psychological problem in the surviving twin. In addition, losing a baby in a multiple pregnancy can lead to complex feelings of grief in the parents which might influence the parental attachment to the surviving baby. One study found a relationship between losing a co-twin in the womb and anxiety in children, however, to date no studies have examined whether there is an association between losing a co-twin in the womb and emotional and attachment problems in adulthood. The sample of this study consisted of 96 participants (90,63% females, Mage = 44,38) of which 82 single born twins and 14 full siblings. Participants completed an online survey with multiple questionnaires to measure emotional and attachment problems. The regression analyses showed that single born twins reported more emotional and attachment problems than non-single born twins. A paired samples t-test showed the same results for emotional problems when comparing single born twins with their siblings. The age at which single born twins heard about their loss was not associated with the severity of emotional and attachment problems. The results indicate the importance of researching the link between losing a co-twin in the womb and emotional and attachment problems and suggest to take the personal experiences, environmental influences, and nesting of participants in families into account.","['early twin loss', 'single born twin', 'psychosocial problems', 'attachment', 'vanishing twin syndrome', 'twin studies', 'family design']"

Risk and protective factors for adolescent stress,"Lindeijer, Kimberly","['Sieh, D.S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Adolescent stress can yield both precipitating and perpetuating factors for internalizing and externalizing disorders. This cross-sectional Dutch study examined possible risk and protective factors to find a predictive model for adolescent stress. We hypothesized that mental and/or physical illness in the family, incomplete family composition and financial problems were possible risk factors for adolescent stress. Further, we expected that being religious, having a positive parental relationship and being part of a social group were possible protective factors for adolescent stress. This study included 13,411 participants (52% female, mean age 14.2) completing the Health Monitor Youth 2019 of the Community Health Service North and East Gelderland. Linear regression analyses indicated that having a family member with a mental and/or physical illness, incomplete family composition and having financial problems negatively correlated with adolescent stress. Also, having a good parental relationship positively correlated with adolescent stress. No significant relationship was found between being part of a social group or degree of religious beliefs and adolescent stress. In comparison with males, females reported higher amounts of adolescent stress. With respect to interaction effects, familial illness appeared to affect females more than males. Lower education level and higher age were related to higher amounts of adolescent stress. The results suggest that health care professionals and teachers that come in contact with adolescents should pay special attention to the abovementioned risk and protective factors, so possible interventions can be implemented promptly.",
"Association Between Parental Bonding, Sexual Discrimination, and Mental Health","Brammer, Natalie",['Dr. Niki Antypa'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Previous studies have shown that parental bonding (PB) is directly and in interaction with stressful events linked to mental health outcomes. Sexism affects many young women and is often associated with psychopathology. This research aimed to further investigate the relation between PB, sexual discrimination and mental health outcomes. Non-optimal maternal and paternal bonding styles and higher frequency of sexual discrimination were expected to be related to greater depressive and anxiety-related symptoms. Furthermore, PB was examined as a moderator on the sexism-symptomatology (depression and anxiety) links. Methods: In a cross-sectional study design, female university students (N = 186) self-reported perceived PB, sexist events, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: Regression analyses revealed that compared to optimal PB, both maternal and paternal affectionless control and neglectful parenting significantly predicted depressive symptoms, whereas symptoms of anxiety were only significantly higher in paternal affectionless control profiles. Frequent sexual discrimination significantly predicted greater depression and anxiety symptomatology, and paternal but not maternal bonding moderated these relations. Non-optimal paternal bonding strengthened the relationships of sexism with symptoms of depression and anxiety, while for optimal paternal bonding, no significant link between sexism and depression was present. Conclusion: The findings indicate direct associations of both non-optimal PB and sexual discrimination with symptoms of depression and anxiety, and provide preliminary evidence that the sexism-symptomatology link might be more pronounced in non-optimal than optimal paternal bonding profiles. This study highlights the centrality of positive father-daughter relationships and sets implications for future research, parenting practices and intervention programs.","['Parental Bonding', 'Sexual Discrimination', 'Mental Health', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'Female University Students']"
Stigmatizing attitudes towards individuals with psoriasis and its predictors in the Dutch population,"Museler, Leonie","['van Beugen, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Stigmatization frequently occurs in individuals with a skin condition such as psoriasis, which can negatively influence their mental health and disease status. While stigma is known to be the leading cause of disability for these individuals, little is known about stigmatizing attitudes among the general population and its correlates. This study aimed to examine stigmatizing attitudes towards psoriasis among the Dutch population and investigated possible predictors. An online survey was administered to 124 participants, which were recruited based on convenience sampling. A 3 x 1 within-subject cross-sectional design was used, investigating the difference in stigmatizing attitudes towards the health conditions psoriasis and common cold (included due to COVID-19), and a healthy control condition. To describe the different conditions, vignettes were used. A one-way repeated measure Manova examined differences between the three conditions on stigmatizing attitudes (assessed by a social distance scale, a direct and indirect version of the impact of skin condition in daily life scale, stereotype endorsement scale, and emotion ratings). In addition, zero-order correlations and multiple regression analyses investigated possible predictors of stigmatizing attitudes towards psoriasis, including sociodemographic variables, familiarity and knowledge about psoriasis, indicators of the behavioral immune system and fear of corona. Manova analysis displayed higher stigmatizing attitudes towards individuals with psoriasis as compared to the control group (p<.001). Besides, overall higher stigmatizing attitudes towards a common cold as compared to the psoriasis group were found. Higher stigmatizing attitudes towards psoriasis were correlated with lower knowledge, higher pathogen disgust, higher perceived infectability, male gender, and familiarity with psoriasis. No correlations were found regarding age, education, fear of corona, or gem aversion. Multiple regression displayed male gender, higher levels of pathogen disgust, and lower levels of knowledge about psoriasis to be predictors of stigmatizing attitudes (p<.05). Stigmatizing attitudes towards psoriasis is shown to be prevalent in Dutch society. As stigmatizing attitudes were shown to be related to reduced knowledge and male gender, future interventions might focus on these factors. Besides, different age groups and professions could be investigated in future studies. Further research is needed, as stigma towards psoriasis is rarely been investigated among the public.","['Psoriasis', 'Common Cold', 'Stigma', 'Predictors']"

Development of a decision tool for early identification of adult patients with severe and complex bipolar disorder psychopathology in need of highly specialized care,"Schenk, Maximilian",['Manja Koenders'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Bipolar disorder is a complex and severe mental disorder. Despite evidence-based pharmacological and psychosocial interventions, complete stability is only reached by a small proportion of people who have BD, with over 90% of BD patients relapsing into new mood episodes during their lifetime. However, tools to differentiate patients who benefit sufficiently from standardized guideline treatment from patients who need more intensive or highly specialized treatment are lacking. The aim of the current study is to develop a decision tool for bipolar disorder that aids clinicians in early identification of a complex disease course in patients with bipolar disorder that are in need of highly specialized tertiary treatment. An earlier literature review led to the identification of 37 factors associated with a more unfavorable and complex disease course. Based on two expert rounds, using the Delphi method seven items were selected for the final tool: insufficient symptomatic recovery, comorbid personality problems, rapid cycling pattern, trauma, somatic comorbidity, psychiatric comorbidity, (the wish to become) pregnant. The pilot validation study indicated that the tool demonstrated good validity to identify patients for highly specialized tertiary care. A total score of ≥3 was found to represent an optimal cut-off point for identifying bipolar patients in need of highly specialized care. The currently developed decision tool could aid clinicians in identifying complex and severe pathology in bipolar disorder in early stages of diagnoses and treatment and subsequently allocating patients to highly specialized treatment. Validation in larger samples sizes is needed to make this tool generalizable to healthcare systems where early identification of severe cases is needed, across and beyond the Netherlands.","['bipolar', 'decision tool', 'severity', 'referral', 'highly specialized', 'tertiary']"

Role Theory and Small States’ Foreign Policy: Explaining Hungary’s China policy under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán,"Koleszár, Réka","['van de Wetering, C.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Small states’ roles in international relations have often been overlooked but the dynamics have changed in recent times. With the creation of international organizations, small states can punch above their weight and exert influence, making them important actors to consider. Their foreign policy choices can have significant impacts, however, traditional theories cannot always explain them. Constructivism based role theory is a new approach to foreign policy analysis with the potential to establish the link between size and behaviour. This paper aims to test whether role theory can explain Hungary’s foreign policy behaviour between 2010 and 2021. Despite being a small state, Hungary has received disproportionally significant attention in recent years due to its baffling foreign policy shifts. Amid the increasing geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China, Hungary often blatantly supported the latter at the expense of its EU and NATO allies. Through an inductive, latent content analysis of the Hungarian Prime Minister’s speeches, this research shows that role theory is a useful approach to make sense of puzzling foreign policy outcomes, especially regarding small states. The identified national role conceptions of the Prime Minister establish a direct link with the country’s confrontational foreign policy with Western allies and explain Hungary’s efforts to strengthen relations with China.","['Small states', 'Hungary', 'Viktor Orbán', 'CEE', 'China-Hungary relations']"
Stimulus-Preceding Negativity and Nocebo Effects in Pain: An EEG Study,"Bos, Daniëlle","['Blythe, J.S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The nocebo effect, which occurs when an inert intervention results in the worsening of symptoms due to negative expectations, affects the experience of pain. Negative expectations may be shaped through verbal suggestions and classical conditioning, but it is unclear how these learning processes affect anticipatory brain processing related to nocebo-enhanced pain. Therefore, this within-subjects study explored whether stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN), a slow-wave event-related potential component that reflects perceptual and emotional anticipation, would increase in response to cues that predicted high heat pain compared to cues that predicted moderate heat pain. A positive relationship between SPN amplitude and the nocebo effect was expected during evocation. The sample consisted of 36 healthy adults (24 females). SPN was measured from -500 ms to 0 ms relative to pain stimulus onset using electroencephalography, and pain intensity was measured using a numeric rating scale. A nocebo effect was induced through a negative verbal suggestion and classical conditioning. During induction participants learned to associate the sham activation of a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation device with high pain stimuli (nocebo), relative to moderate intensity stimuli when the device was turned off (control). During evocation only moderate pain was applied. Results showed a significant nocebo effect, p < .001. There was no difference in SPN amplitude between nocebo and control trials in the evocation phase, p = .26. There was a trend towards greater negativity for nocebo trials. There was no relationship between SPN and the nocebo effect during evocation, p = .41. Post-hoc, there was a positive relationship between SPN and pain ratings, p = .002. These results suggest that SPN does not directly reflect anticipatory processing related to nocebo-enhanced pain, but that it does become larger as an individual experiences more intense pain. This finding is clinically relevant because it argues that the estimation of SPN could perhaps aid in the assessment and treatment of pain. Future research should explore SPN further with the use of standardized experimental designs and multiple levels of pain intensity, and with the inclusion of clinical groups.","['stimulus-preceding negativity', 'nocebo', 'pain', 'EEG']"
The effect of visual notifications on user performance in an augmented reality environment: a distribution of attention between exogenous and endogenous stimuli,"Schelvis, Kasper","['van der Ham, C.J.M']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study examined the interface design of an augmented reality (AR) system that was being developed by the Dutch Police Force to assist police officers on horseback in navigating unknown terrain. The main research objective was to investigate the effect of visual notifications on the officers’ responsiveness to navigation-assisting stimuli (i.e. ‘user performance’). These stimuli consisted of buzzer sounds and direction indicators. Since navigation support was the primary goal of the interface, attention focused on navigation-supporting stimuli was regarded endogenous. Because information provision was a secondary goal, attention drawn to notifications was regarded exogenous. To investigate the influence of exogenous stimuli on the quality of endogenous information processing, a virtual environment was created. In this environment, ninety-nine participants walked both a route with notifications and a route without notifications. (Endogenous) response times of both conditions were compared to determine the effect of the exogenous stimuli. Subsequently, both the role of timing and the effect of endogenous-exogenous competition on travel speed were investigated. Several repeated measures analyses of variance have been conducted. Exogenous stimuli were found to have a significant negative effect on user performance, F(1,87) = 11.193, p = .001, η2 = .114. In addition, the range between approximately 600 and 1000 milliseconds before the appearance of endogenous stimuli is probably the region in which endogenous user performance starts to be prone to exogenous stimuli, F(1,9) = 10.005, p = .011, η2 = .526. Lastly, it turned out that notifications caused participants to run faster, F(1,86) = 8.162, p < .05, η2 = .087. This study showed that stimuli in AR interfaces can enhance the travel speed of users. This is a desirable effect, since it is important for police officers to arrive at their destination as quickly as possible. This study also showed that exogenous stimuli can decrease user performance, as a result of which they could jeopardize users and others in the (traffic) environment. However, this study also provided an indication of the timing range in which exogenous stimuli are most likely to cause this undesired effect. Based on this range, timing-related blockages of distracting stimuli can be built into AR systems in an effective and efficient way, through which the performance-reducing effect of exogenous stimuli could be avoided. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In deze studie is onderzoek gedaan naar een ‘augmented reality’ (AR) navigatie systeem dat de politie wil gebruiken bij evenementen. Met de AR technologie kan door middel van een digitale bril een virtuele laag over het gezichtsveld van politieagenten worden geplaatst. Deze laag bestaat deels uit richtingaanwijzers en deels uit notificaties. Hierdoor kunnen politieagenten worden geholpen met het vinden van de weg en kunnen zij daarnaast worden geïnformeerd over de omgeving of noodsituaties. Het effect van notificaties op de ‘gebruikersprestatie’, die aan de hand van reactietijden is gemeten, stond centraal in dit onderzoek. Het idee hierachter is dat de gebruikersprestatie iets zegt over de mate waarin iemand zich kan concentreren op de richtingaanwijzers en het verkeer. Dit is onderzocht aan de hand van een virtuele omgeving, waarin participanten zowel een route met notificaties als een route zonder notificaties hebben gelopen. Het onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat de snelheid waarmee de participanten door de virtuele omgeving liepen door de notificaties werd verhoogd. Dit is een gewenst effect, omdat het in noodsituaties van belang is dat politieagenten snel ter plaatse zijn. Ook is gebleken dat het tonen van notificaties de gebruikersprestatie verlaagt, hetgeen een ongewenst effect is omdat het in het kader van de navigatiedoelstelling en de verkeersveiligheid belangrijk is dat politieagenten snel op richtingaanwijzers en hun omgeving kunnen reageren. Echter kwam uit het onderzoek ook naar voren dat de gebruikersprestatie minder sterk werd beïnvloed wanneer een notificatie minimaal 1000 milliseconden na een navigatie-ondersteunend signaal werd weergegeven dan wanneer een notificatie maximaal 600 milliseconden na een dergelijk signaal werd weergegeven. Dit resultaat stelt ontwerpers van AR-systemen in staat om te voorkomen dat notificaties de gebruikersprestatie verlagen, omdat zij op basis van deze informatie een specifiek kader hebben waarmee zij notificaties afhankelijk van hun timing tijdelijk kunnen blokkeren. Zo kan op een effectieve en efficiënte manier worden voorkomen dat agenten op kwetsbare momenten worden afgeleid, zonder dat dit ten koste gaat van tijdige communicatie van informatie die de agenten nodig hebben om hun overige taken uit te voeren.","['Augmented reality', 'Virtual reality', 'Police', 'endogenous', 'exogenous', 'attention', 'user performance', 'response time', 'navigation', 'interface', 'design', 'notifications', 'direction indicators', 'intersections']"

Therefore, interventions to prevent burnout symptoms are desirable. This review aims at exploring existing burnout prevention interventions for higher education students and their effectiveness. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to create an overview of existing interventions. To be eligible for this review, a study must be an intervention study, it must be aimed at (a component of) burnout prevention or stress prevention/reduction, it must include a student population and it must be written in English, Dutch or Greek language. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were eligible. Finally, ten studies where included in the qualitative analysis. Qualitative analysis revealed that the included interventions are useful in stress source recognition, stress reduction and increasing relaxation. Therefore, they are seen as helpful in preventing burnout in students. Five of the included studies (239 participants in total) contained enough data to be included in the meta-analysis. The quantitative analysis revealed that the included interventions significantly reduce levels of stress (Hedges’ g intervention-control comparison studies: 0.544; pre-post comparison studies: 0.692), but did not significantly reduce burnout symptoms (Hedges’ g omnibus intervention-control comparison studies: 0.127; focused intervention-control comparison studies: 0.110; omnibus pre-post comparison studies: 0.040; focused pre-post comparison studies: -0.049). In conclusion, results from this review and meta-analysis provide support that effective stress reduction interventions for students exist. However, these interventions are not effective in reducing burnout symptoms.

"What are the differences between Dutch and international students, using the online intervention ""Moodpep"" to decrease depressive symptoms?","Schweiger, Jonathan",['Dr. S. van Luenen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract International and domestic university students suffer extraordinarily from mental health problems. More and more universities are using digital mental health interventions (DMHI) to counter their negative consequences but do not distinguish between these two groups of students. So far, no research has included the different sources of experienced stress between international and domestic students and its effect on mental health. This research investigated the relationship between the students' origin status (international or domestic) and depressive symptoms where perceived stress was included as a mediator. Furthermore, the study focused on the effect of the students' origin on the outcomes and ratings of a Dutch DMHI named 'Moodpep.' We analyzed the data provided from a student mental health initiative (Caring Universities), which conducted multiple measurements from the online Moodpep intervention at four Dutch universities. A mediation analysis and two independent t-tests analyses were conducted to test for differences between international and domestic students regarding baseline conditions and the post-intervention outcomes. There was no observation of a mediating role of perceived stress in the relationship between the students' origin and the development of depressive symptoms. No significant differences were found in terms of the digital intervention's effect and rating amongst the two student groups. Both international and domestic student groups benefited from the Moodpep intervention to the same extent. Further research needs to be done to investigate the effects of the different circumstances, origins, and cultural backgrounds of the students conducting DMHI.",

De Relatie Tussen het Zelfbeeld en Externaliserend Probleemgedrag: Onderzoek bij Meiden van Acht tot en met Achttien Jaar,"Roos, Vienna","['Bergwerff, C. E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Purpose: This study is an exploration of the relationship between self-image and externalizing problem behavior for girls. This behavior is most commonly observed for boys but seems to be the most difficult to inhibit for girls. This study may contribute to novel interventions for this specific group of girls. Besides self-image, the subdomain social acceptance, the subdomain physical appearance and age may also be related with this behavior for girls. Therefore, these variables have also been included in the study. Methods: The subjects of this study were girls between eight and eighteen years old (n = 35) who participated in a bigger study from the Preventief Interventie Team (PIT) that selected children and adolescents based on their higher risk for showing externalizing behavior. The Competentie Belevingsschaal voor Kinderen (CBSK) and the Compententie Belevingsschaal voor Adolescenten (CBSA) were filled out by the girls themselves to measure self-image and the two subdomains social acceptance and physical appearance. To measure externalizing problem behavior in the study subjects, the Teacher Report Form (TRF) was taken by the teachers and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was taken by the parents. Results: Self-image and social acceptance both correlate significantly with externalizing behavior as judged by the teachers but not by the parents. Physical appearance and age did not show such correlation, consequently self-image is not a mediator for the relationship between age and externalizing behavior. Conclusions: These results suggest that girls with a more positive self-image or girls who feel socially accepted show more externalizing behavior at school, but not at home. Based on the study limitations these conclusions must be interpreted carefully. With a bigger sample, more variable sources and diverse measurements, future research can hopefully focus on how interventions can help these girls develop a realistic self-image to inhibit or even prevent externalizing behavior.","['Zelfbeeld', 'Externaliserend Probleemgedrag', 'Meiden', 'Onderzoek', 'Acht tot en met Achttien jaar']"

Restoration and Openness to experience: An explorative study,"Baudet, Leon","['Ineke van der Ham', 'Suzanne Brinkman']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"(EN) Restoration through exposure to a natural environment is a well established phenomenon. Yet, studies within the framework of the central theories on its mechanisms, ART and SRT, show conflicting results. Moreover, individual differences are left out of consideration in the restoration research. The current study aimed to examine the validity of central theories on restoration and explore the relationship between personality and restoration by a natural environment. .N=125 participants were recruited to participate. Participants were exposed to slides of natural environments and personality and affect variables were measured. An increase in positive and decrease in negative affect was expected. Further, it was expected that higher Openness would positively influence restorative outcomes. Results indicated a decrease in negative and surprisingly also a decrease in positive affect following exposure. Additionally, results indicated no effect of Openness.

"Treatment Outcome, Efficiency and Time Performance for Mental Disorders: Comparing Indicators of Quality of Care","Couvée, Johanna F.",['Edwin de Beurs'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In the face of expanding needs and demand for mental healthcare, coupled with rising costs and limited resources in Western countries, Value-Based Health Care (VBHC) is proposed as a structural framework to improve achieved outcomes per encountered costs, and evaluate the quality of care accordingly. The present study aims to compare quality indicators based on principles of VBHC, and to evaluate whether treatment outcome alone, or in combination with cost and duration, provides the best information on quality of care. Data of patients with common mental disorders from a Dutch outpatient mental health care provider were used. Treatment outcome was operationalized as pre-to-posttreatment difference in severity of symptoms (ΔT), and as reliable change (improved) and clinical significant change (recovered). We distinguished three quality indicators: ΔT, efficiency (ΔT divided by costs) and time performance (ΔT divided by duration). These indicators were compared on their ability to distinguish quality of care in teams and subgroups of patients differing in clinical complexity. The results showed that the indicators’ ability to distinguish between treatments, does not increase when cost or duration are taken into consideration, in comparison to outcome alone, when analyzed at a patient-based level. The patient-based indicators denoted suboptimal validity. A comparison with indicators developed at a group-based level did not confirm the patient-based results. We suggest for future research to elaborate a robust operational framework to define value with VBHC principles and use this for the urgently needed improvement of value in mental health care.",['Performance indicator · Value-Based Health Care · Treatment outcome · Costs · Duration · Mental health']
Bringing NATO Home? A comparative analysis on Alliance Cohesion of NATO's out-of-area operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan,"Weerd, Emma Suzanna de","['Rrustemi, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis compares the effects of NATO’s out-of-area operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan to analyze what effect geographical distance of operations have on Alliance Cohesion through the method of process tracing. Mainly because of the current geopolitical shift, it is important to evaluate what NATO should look out for policy-wise moving forward. The main variable of analysis in this was the changing threat-perception of the five largest contributors to both operations. The threat-perception was determined by analyzing national security reports and other primary sources from the countries involved in the analysis, focusing on elite-level policy making. What was found in the comparison was the threat-perceptions of all analyzed states were more aligned in the operations in Kosovo, while the lack of regional/national interests for the analyzed states in Afghanistan made it hard for the states to securitize the operations, damaging Alliance Cohesion. National interests and geopolitical interests were combined in the case of Kosovo, and led to the same end-goal. Meanwhile the operations in Afghanistan led to a larger discrepancy between national interests and geopolitical interests, making Alliance commitment tougher to define, and follow through on.","['International Politics', 'Security', 'International Organisations', 'NATO', 'Cohesion', 'Alliance Cohesion', 'Military', 'Civil Military Relations']"
Evaluating the Effectiveness of International Climate Funding on a National Level: - The Case of the Adaptation Fund’s Project in Georgia,"Seong, Jin","['Mos, Martijn']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis researches the effectiveness of climate finance by observing the Adaptation Fund (AF), an international climate fund operationalised in 2007. Using qualitative analysis of the AF’s project in Georgia it asks: “How did the Adaptation Fund influence climate policy in Georgia?”. To answer the research question, this thesis researches the effectiveness of the project in Georgia, with three factors that are considered key components of determining an effective national climate finance policy. While different definitions exist in defining effectiveness, this thesis investigates the project through Bird et al’s three factors— policy environments that support climate change investment, the institutional foundation which distributes responsibility, and the national financial system. Based on the AF’s project documents and a semi-structured interview, this thesis uses a process-tracing method to test the three factors and finally demonstrates how the AF’s project “effectively” influenced the climate policy in Georgia.","['climate finance', 'climate fund', 'Adaptation Fund', 'policy environment', 'institutional structure', 'financial system', 'Georgia', 'flooding prevention']"

Multiple scholars have shown the relevance of using regime complexity to understand that dynamics of international organisations (Orsini et al., 2013; Margulis, 2021). This study contributes to the understanding of regime complexity by investigating modes of interaction of the AU and the OACPS in a situation of overlapping interest or membership in their relations with the European Union. The modes of their interactions were tested by analysing publicly available documentation. The analysis revealed that the behaviour of an institution in a regime complex can differ depending on the area of interest. The case also showed that overlapping institutions can have significantly different approaches towards each other. Where the AU positions itself as a competitor and rival of the OACPS, the latter positions itself as a collaborator of the former.",
"The Union is a Means, but also a Goal in Itself: A study of how Dutch unions justify the use of different strategies to achieve organisational and policy goals","Voncken, Luuk","['Otjes, S.P']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores how unions in the Netherlands justify their chosen strategies to achieve their goals. Organisational pressure and their institutional role as labour representation has created a situation in the Netherlands where unions have the need to pursue organisational goals next to policy goals. Through interviews with board members of the two largest Dutch trade unions, supplemented with data from newspaper interviews, this thesis analyses the strategic choices made by them. It shows that the larger union (FNV) follows the proposed expectations by pushing for organisational growth to maintain union influence and uses outsider strategies, in the form of campaigns, to appeal to potential members. CNV takes a different approach, focussing on providing services to their members to persuade people to join. This focus on collective or individual advocacy could be a trend, however more research is needed to confirm this. This study also found that both unions still heavily rely on insider strategies in pursuit of their policy goals. However, unions have less trust in the institutions through which this dialogue is facilitated. This can be accounted for through overuse of the advisory body and lack of implementation of the advisory opinions by the government.","['Trade Unions', 'Dutch Trade Unions', 'Interest Groups', 'Corporatism', 'Organisational Pressure', 'Dutch Politics']"

Cutting Across the Divide: An analysis of the potential of civil society organizations working against gender-based violence to abate ethnic polarization,"Olsson, Edda","['Tsagkroni, Vasiliki']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Despite mounting ethnic polarization worldwide and research pointing to the benefits of building inter- ethnic ties, civil society organization’s role in abating polarization through the bridging of people in ethnically divided societies is still under researched. Yet, how these organizations can work on cross- cutting issues in ethnically polarized countries is both impacted by, and could perhaps help counter, ethnic divisions. This thesis explores whether civil society organizations have the potential to diminish polarization through their work on cross-cutting issues such as gender-based violence. This is done through investigating the cases of three Indian civil society organizations working on its elimination: Astitva Samajik Sansthan, SAHAYOG and HUMSAFAR. Drawing on Putnam’s theory of social capital it is found that through uniting people around a shared threat, shared commitments, norms and mutual benefits, CSOs do have the potential to facilitate bridging between their members. Thus, it is concluded that CSOs working on cross-cutting issues of universal importance, which builds social capital and unites people over a common cause, could potentially provide opportunities for ethnic polarization to be reduced. Further research is however needed on the actual impact such organizations could have.","['ethnic polarization', 'social capital', 'civil society organizations', 'gender-based violence']"

More specifically, it analyzes the variation in the actions of the EC based on the case of rule of law non-compliance by Poland and unravels why this variation exists. While researchers have studied the reasons for non-compliance within the EU and the different approaches the EU can take to deal with non-compliance, not enough focus has been placed on the reasons for the variations in choices following a violation by a Member State. Therefore the research question is ‘What explains the variation in the EU’s approach to the non-compliance of the Polish state with the rule of law?’ The research uses process tracing to look at intentionality, domestic mobilization and costs. The thesis finds that intentionality and costs can explain the varied approaches of the EU. The domestic mobilization hypothesis is rejected due to lack of evidence showing it affects the outcome.","['Non-compliance', 'rule of law crisis', 'Poland', 'European Commission']"

Within a framework of cospecialization, this study explores potential gender differences in the municipal council of Utrecht in the period of October 2020 to October 2021 using mixed methods. Motions and its cosponsors were analyzed, where gender did not have a significant effect on the cosponsoring of council members. Cospecialization however, did have a significant effect, in line with the cospecialization literature. The interviews with council members were intended to explain any potentially found effects in the quantitative analysis, yet none of the participants alluded to a difference in gender when it came to political behavior quantified as cosponsoring motions. Still, some other themes for potential future research were brought up. A new hierarchy of factors is proposed based on the qualitative data (cospecialization, agreement, issue topic, and personal relations), and the data is contextualized and situated in the existent literature, from which future comparative studies are suggested.","['Cosponsorship', 'cospecialization', 'gender', 'local politics', 'motions']"
Managing Fear Under Stress: The impact of stress and sex on novelty-facilitated extinction,"Kruk, Katarzyna","['Schomaker, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders and this is why developing effective treatments and prevention methods targeting them is highly relevant. Extinction therapy is one of the possible tools enabling us to combat these highly prevalent disorders. One of the ways to facilitate the process of extinction is introducing a novel stimulus during extinction training, in order to reduce chances of spontaneous recovery of the conditional response, being fear. This research paper investigates the question if subjective stress levels influence the effect of novelty on fear extinction. The aim of the present study was to understand the role of stress in novelty-facilitated extinction and whether there are any sex differences in the effect of novelty on fear extinction. In an experimental setting, participants were conditioned with fear, exposed to the novelty-facilitated extinction procedure and were asked to fill in a Perceived Stress Scale Questionnaire. An effect of stress was found within the male sample, showing that highly stressed men are not as susceptible to the effects of the novelty-facilitated extinction as less stressed men. The main limitations of this study were missing norm values for evaluating the stress questionnaire and missing a tool to establish the kind of stressors, which were affecting participants. For further research, a sample with the same number of males and females is recommended to evaluate gender differences.","['novelty-facilitated extinction', 'anxiety disorders', 'conditioning', 'fear']"

High prevalence rates of depression and anxiety, feelings of being an impostor, as well as sleep problems have been reported in this population. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between academic stress and sleep quality in university students and how different levels of impostor syndrome potentially influence this relationship. The current study used a set of self-report questionnaires to measure perceived academic stress, the severity and frequency of impostor syndrome and sleep quality. The respondents (N = 50) were all students at Leiden University (96% female, 4% male). It was hypothesized that impostor syndrome moderates the relationship between academic stress and sleep quality such that: if academic stress is high, sleep quality is expected to be low and it is expected that impostor syndrome strengthens this relationship so individuals who experience high academic stress and high impostor syndrome would have the worst sleep quality. The relationship between academic stress and sleep quality was not significant F(2,43) = 0.644, p = .530; the relationship remained non-significant even after adding the interaction effect between impostor syndrome and academic stress F(3,42) = 0.449, p = .719. Insignificance of the results indicated a rejection of a moderating effect of the impostor syndrome on the relationship between academic stress and sleep quality. However, results showed that academic stress was perceived as high, impostor syndrome symptoms were common and sleep quality was generally low. Because these experiences are prevalent in the student population, this study urges to further investigate the relationships between sleep quality, academic stress and impostor syndrome and how they influence each other in order to find methods to help students to cope with academic stress and to overcome dysfunctional beliefs and fears about their own abilities.","['academic stress, sleep quailty, impostor syndrome']"

This thesis will focus on the Netherlands as a case study, with Sigrid Kaag and Rob Jetten providing the qualitative sample. The Netherlands was chosen as research is lacking on European countries, while the Netherlands has one of the highest rates of women legislators. Choosing two politicians who both have prominent positions in the political party D66, with different genders will allow the research to ascertain if there is a difference in tweets that mention Sigrid Kaag and Rob Jetten.

Foreign Aid as a Mechanism of Neocolonialism? A Case Study on U.S. Development Aid to the Northern Triangle through the Alliance for Prosperity Plan,"Scartelli, Olivia","['Tsagkroni, V.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"After the influx of Central American unaccompanied child migrants to the U.S. southern border in 2014, the Northern Triangle governments of, Honduras, and Guatemala, and El Salvador, partnered with the Obama administration to implement the Alliance for Prosperity plan, a development initiative introduced by Northern Triangle governments to stem irregular migration through promoting regional economic growth and security. To support the Plan, the U.S. financed $1 billion in foreign aid assistance and programming. In reality, the Alliance for Prosperity plan was a continuation of the same neoliberal economic model in existence between the U.S. and Northern Triangle region for decades, which has been found to secure national security and business interests over that of inclusive growth among Central American societies. Considering President Biden’s $4 billion commitment to build on this model, the case study that follows seeks to explore through qualitative analysis the hypothesis that the previous Alliance for Prosperity plan was used to perpetuate neocolonial mechanisms of economic dependency, resource extraction, and territorial control, to undermine the Plan’s objective to inspire inclusive growth among the Central American people. The findings reveal that the Plan perpetuates neocolonialism by consistently implementing policies that exacerbate local inequalities and neglecting to enforce measures of transparency and accountability. Maintaining the status quo affords the U.S. favorable economic and security interests while at the same time ensuring the dominance of a Central American elitist class. Both partners lack an incentive to change development approaches, serving as an explanation to why foreign aid to address the Central American migrant crisis has undermined its own efforts.","['Neocolonialism', 'American Foreign Policy', 'Migration', 'Economic Development', 'Foreign Aid', 'Latin American Politics', 'Dependency', 'Resource Extraction']"

Thus, this thesis aims to uncover whether change in liberal democracy rank explains change in restrictiveness of Latin American migration policies. This thesis uses historical institutionalism as a theoretical lens to expose the role of domestic institutions in shaping state policymaking. A proportional odds logistic regression was conducted and revealed strong evidence that when there is an increase in liberal democracy ranking, there is a lower probability of restrictive migration policy implementation. Additionally, national gross domestic product and the political ideology of the party in power were shown to offer some explanatory power for change in migration policies. The analysis concluded that change in liberal democracy rank offers a convincing explanation for change in migration policy restrictiveness. Although the scope of this analysis means results can only speak for trends in Latin America, this thesis highlights the importance of viewing liberal democracy as ranked and not an ideal type when understanding it’s impact on policymaking. Further research should consider a broader scope of analysis as data collection in the region becomes more extensively available.","['Proportional Odds Logistic Regression', 'Latin America', 'Migration Policy Restrictiveness', 'Liberal Democracy Rank', 'Regime Change']"

Procedural Environmental Justice in Xinjiang’s Tarim Basin: An Argument for the Applicability of the Environmental Justice Framework in Non-Western Contexts,"Marabini San Martín, Blanca","['Tsagkroni, V.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Procedural environmental justice is mostly studied using the framework provided by the Aarhus Convention. However, both the concept and the framework are of Western origin, which has generated resistance when it comes to applying it to non-Western contexts. Such is the case of China, where scholars and authorities ascribe environmental injustice to the urban/rural and east/west divides, rather than ethnic and race factors. Many of them thus argue that environmental justice, and its derived concepts, are not applicable to the Chinese context, as they are intrinsically linked to race. The present thesis contends that the applicability of the PEJ model in China can be ensured by incorporating the element of recognition into it. Following this theory, the author develops an improved, four-pillar PEJ model and tests it by applying it to the case of the Tarim Basin Uyghurs. This model adjusts the three original PEJ pillars established in the Aarhus Convention (access to relevant environmental information, participation in environmental decisionmaking, and review procedures to challenge environmental government decisions) to the Chinese context. The application of each of these pillars is accompanied by a comparison of the Convention text and the relevant Chinese legislation to demonstrate a converging trend between the two. A new, fourth pillar is also applied, focused on authority recognition of inequality. The application of the four-pillar model highlights the existence of a gap between the literature and the thesis findings, which highlights the value of using a model that is more sensitive to ethnic factors in non-Western contexts.","['procedural environmental justice', 'China', 'Xinjiang', 'Uyghurs', 'information disclosure', 'public participation', 'public interest litigation', 'Aarhus Convention', 'recognition of injustice']"

The following thesis analyzes why this exclusion remains despite international efforts to reform the Bosnian Constitution until this day. Investigating the case from 2005, the beginning of the first reform negotiations, to 2018, when the last general elections took place under discriminatory conditions. Proposing a causal mechanism of four steps, I argue that the issue lies in the general approach of corporate consociationalism, in which cooperation is unlikely due to the institutionalization of often hostile ethnic groups. Finally, in this thesis, it becomes clear that the link to this issue is the abuse of the veto-right in Bosnia, making cooperation and negotiation on complex political problems nearly impossible","['Consociational Democracies', 'Political Participation', 'Bosnia and Herzegovina']"

Examining the NJP’s discourses provides both a better understanding of new developments within the far-right, as well as knowledge of how best to counter them. By applying the discourse-historical approach, it was found that the NJP’s discourses are partially in established literature as it relates to far-right ideological influences and the structure of its discourses. The NJP is partially outside of it for its novel systemization of what it calls ‘the anti-white system.’ This system causes whites to be systematically disadvantaged by elite Jews for advantage or profit. The anti-semitic scapegoating in addition to other contextual factors, suggest that the NJP is motivated by the increasing economic precarity and racial polarization in the country.

The Role of Trust in EU e-Participation: The Case of e-Petitions to the European Parliament,"Klotsonis, David","['Otjes, S.P.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Electronic participation initiatives at the national and the EU-level have been consistently increasing in number and scope in the last two decades. Despite this trend, adoption of e-participation tools by citizens remains low. By conducting an analysis of e-petitions to the European Parliament in the period from 2013 – 2019, this study examines whether more trust towards the EU leads to more EU-level e-participation. Although previous studies have shown a positive relationship between trust and e-participation at the local and national levels, this is the first study to examine whether the same relationship exists at the EU-level. The results from a multiple linear regression across 27 member states suggest that more trust towards the EU does not lead to more e-participation. This finding is a first step in uncovering the dynamics between trust and e-participation in the EU, which could have important policy implications for the design and deployment of e-participation initiatives in the future.","['e-participation', 'trust', 'EU', 'EU Parliament', 'e-petitions']"

Effect of Menstrual Cycle and Spontaneous Eye Blink Rate on Performance Monitoring in Naturally Cycling Adult Females,"Bode, Shareen Sophie","['Jansen, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The effect of hormones on mood and cognition has been widely recognized yet often ignored in neurocognitive research. The error-related negativity, an event-related potential supposed to index performance monitoring, is thought to be driven by dopamine and has been shown to be amplified by anxiety and reduced by mood. The current study utilized a within‐subject design to examine the association between menstrual cycle phase, spontaneous eye blink rate (as putative marker of dopamine) and the error-related negativity. 42 normal-cycling females performed a Flanker task during the early follicular phase, which is characterized by low levels of estrogen and progesterone and during the mid-luteal phase, which is characterized by high levels of estrogen and progesterone. It was hypothesized that females with a lower eye blink rate have a larger error-related negativity in the mid-luteal phase compared to the early follicular phase and females with a higher eye blink rate have a larger error-related negativity in the early follicular phase compared to the mid-luteal phase. Results showed no main or interaction effect of cycle phase and eye blink rate on the ERN. However, there was an interaction of cycle phase and eye blink rate on reaction times and a link between eye blink rate and estrogen in the mid-luteal phase. These findings point to a link between ovarian hormonal fluctuations and dopaminergic functioning and might aid future research in understanding the influence of the menstrual cycle on women’s mental and emotional health.","['performance monitoring', 'error-related negativity', 'menstrual cycle', 'spontaneous eye blink rate', 'Eriksen flanker task']"

These issues are for example behavior disorders and the disorder ADHD. The goal of this study was to get an insight of the way in which symptoms of ADHD and behavior disorders can influence the degree of friendship quality during early adolescence. Also, there has been looked at the interaction effect between symptoms of ADHD and behavior disorders on friendship quality. For this research, 119 participants between twelve and sixteen years old have filled in online questionnaires, the ADHD self-report questionnaire, the SDQ for behavior issues and the FSQ and NRI for friendship quality. There’s been a multiple hierarchical regression analysis performed in which there was not a significant model and main effect found of symptoms of ADHD and behavior disorders on friendship quality. There was also not a significant effect in the interaction effect of symptoms of ADHD and behavior disorders on friendship quality. This study shows that the results are not aligned with the hypotheses and earlier research and it is of importance that further research takes a different age range into account of adolescents (14-17) in regard to gender and using extended questionnaires in which other context will be integrated as well.","['ADHD', 'vriendschapskwaliteit', 'gedragsstoornis(sen)', 'adolescentie']"

This study therefore investigated whether childhood maltreatment was associated with a further increase in adolescent depression in response to the pandemic, and what role self-esteem and loneliness play in this association. We examined depressive symptoms before (up to March 2020) and during the pandemic (April 2020), in a sample of 79 adolescents (16-26 years old) of which 67.1% were female and non were non-binary (REACT study; Smith et al., 2021). We found that CM was predictive of depression during the pandemic, but not of depression before the pandemic, nor of an increase in depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we found that loneliness was a significant mediator of the relationship between CM and depression during the pandemic, whereas self-esteem was found to be an independent predictor of depression increase. Based on these findings depression prevention/intervention programs are advised to identify CM survivors and to target loneliness and low self-esteem.","['Loneliness', 'childhood maltreatment', 'self-esteem', 'COVID-19', 'pandemic', 'depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'adolescent', 'REACT', 'RAISE', 'mediation', 'mediates', 'predicts', 'CM', 'CTQ', 'MFQ', 'R-UCLA', 'RSES', 'depression increase', 'social thinning model', ""Teasedale's differential actiovation hypothesis""]"

Due to significant changes with an increased involvement of the business community and strategic elements, such donations can be understood with a new theoretical framework from Corporate Social responsibility (CSR). The theoretical perspective contributes to a new understanding of governments’ foreign aid behavior. More specifically, this study focuses on one part of the theory, named Institutional Window Dressing, to investigate whether governments appy masked communication efforts to maintain legitimacy while changing the initial agenda or not. The investigation conducts a discourse analysis exploring Norwegian foreign policy documents. In addition, explores the opposing forces of altruism and self-interest while investigating the governments during three different periods. The results find multiple CSR stakeholder strategies in Norwegian foreign initiatives. In addition, the policies currently indicate a clear step away from initial and altruistic aid principles towards increased self-interest forces and business components in foreign aid. However, the most valuable finding is that the more self-interest and business elements indicated, the more CSR strategies detected in the policies. While considering the strong legitimacy of Norwegian foreign policies among its stakeholders, these results can signify that high levels of CSR strategies can give a legitimate view of states' foreign aid involvement. The reason is that the purpose of the strategy is to inscribe the government with legitimacy and benefits that gives considerable room for maneuvering.","['Foreign aid', 'Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)', 'Window dressing', 'Norway', 'Altruism', 'Self-interest']"
Sensitiviteit van Moeders en Empathie van Kinderen in verschillende Etnische Groepen,"Heijer, Géneviève den","['Emmen, R. A. G.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"The development of empathy is an important foundation for the development of the child. Maternal sensitivity can play an important role in the development of empathy in children. A parent who is warm, trustworthy, and empathetic towards the child sets a good example for the child. This would allow children to show more empathy themselves. It is important to do more research on the relation between maternal sensitivity and empathy in children by using a sample from different ethnic backgrounds, because most studies used a sample of white, European, and American families. This study mainly examined the relation between maternal sensitivity and children's empathy. In addition, it was investigated whether this relation is the same for white-Dutch, Afro-Dutch and Turkish-Dutch families. A subsample of 208 mothers and children was used for this study. The mother's sensitivity was measured during a collaborative task in which the parent and child had to build two example models with Kapla blocks together. The child’s empathy was measured with the Griffith Empathy Measure questionnaire. Results showed that mothers from an ethnic majority group showed more sensitivity than mothers from ethnic minority groups. Furthermore, children's empathy did not differ across ethnic groups. Also, there appeared to be a positive trend between maternal sensitivity and children's empathy for both ethnic majority and ethnic minority groups. No significant interaction effect was found between ethnicity and maternal sensitivity in relation to children’s empathy. The current study emphasizes the importance of increasing maternal sensitivity within ethnic minority groups by using interventions, because a limited sensitivity may be a bad influence for the development of the child. Follow-up research should investigate the child's empathic behavior further so that interventions can be developed effectively and adequately to increase the child's empathic behavior.","['Sensitiviteit', 'Moeders', 'Empathie', 'Kinderen', 'Etnische groepen', 'Wit-Nederlandse groep', 'Turks-Nederlandse groep', 'Afro-Nederlandse groep']"

Many new employments in this industry are necessary as a result of the energy transition, but they can't be filled with the current workforce. Therefore, this study focused on researching the perceived relevance of lateral entrants and employers regarding transferable skills within the technical sector, and expanding on skill transfer theory by researching differences of skills within lateral entrants in the technical sector. The main hypothesis was to test if soft skills are perceived as more important than hard skills by employers and lateral entrants. Moreover, if lateral entrants score higher on average on soft skills than on hard skills. The general design of this study was both a between, and within-subject design. In this study, a single data collection approach (questionnaires) was used, and observatory explanations were established. The results of the study identified soft skills as the most transferable skills among technical lateral entrants. The findings show that, when it comes to skills, both lateral entrants and employers perceive soft skills to be the most relevant. Furthermore, the research indicates that, on average, lateral entrants scored substantially higher on soft skills than on hard abilities. Due to limitations regarding the acquisition of participants, the number of respondents was low (N=13). In relation to the procedure of this study, there may also be some possible constraints regarding the time and timing of the data acquisition. To better understand the implications of these results, future studies could focus on a bigger sample size and include ‘earlier employment sector’ as a control variable.",['Lateral entrants - Employers – Transferability - Employability - Hard skills - Soft skills - Technical sector - Energy transition']
Positive Reappraisal’s Interrelatedness with Empathy and Cognitive Flexibility,"Sigle, Valentin","['Overgaauw, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Evidence suggests that the emotion regulation strategy positive reappraisal offers a constructive approach in dealing with difficult emotions. Positive reappraisal involves viewing difficult events and emotions as being productive, such as being valuable or beneficial. These benefits were linked, among others, to well-being and decreased depressive symptoms. Previous research indicated empathy and cognitive flexibility’s role in processes related to positive reappraisal. Therefore, this study investigated the interrelatedness between three empathy dimensions, cognitive flexibility, and positive reappraisal. In a within-subjects design, 74 Dutch adolescents filled in the following self-report questionnaires: The Empathy Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents’ (EmQue-CA) cognitive and affective empathy subscales, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index’s (IRI) personal distress subscale, the Cognitive Flexibility Scale (CFS), and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire’s (CERQ) positive reappraisal subscale. While our findings indicated increased cognitive empathy and cognitive flexibility relating to an increased use of positive reappraisal, relationships between affective empathy and personal distress and positive reappraisal were not found. Furthermore, exploratory additional analyses identified the relationships between cognitive empathy and cognitive flexibility and positive reappraisal being curvilinear U-shaped. In the light of an accentuated and amplified social-cognitive development throughout adolescence, our findings particularly suggest that young adolescents with deficits in cognitive empathy and cognitive flexibility benefit from interventions to increase positive reappraisal’s practise. Replicatory research is needed to confirm our findings.","['Positive Reappraisal', 'Cognitive Empathy', 'Affective Empathy', 'Personal Distress', 'Cognitive Flexibility']"
How Does the Mainstreaming of Radical Right-Wing Populist Parties Impact the Performance of Liberal Democracies in Western-Europe?,"Larède, Arthur",['Dr. Joshua Robison'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research will provide a look into the emergence of radical right-wing populist parties across Western-Europe. It aims to see what happens when radical right-wing populist parties and established party policy ideologies converge, also known as mainstreaming. By doing so the research delves into the impact this has on the level of liberal democracy these countries hold. However, current studies lack the information what impact mainstreaming has on liberal democracy. This research tries to uncover that by answering the following question: What impact does the mainstreaming of radical right-wing populist parties have on the performance of liberal democracies? The research will dive into theories on the core tenets of liberal democracy. The value system providing freedom and security for its people. Furthermore, the emergence of radical right-wing populism will be explored, including what it means for a liberal democracy. For this, theories on mainstreaming will be used to uncover how radical right-wing populist parties interact with established parties. The expectation is that radical right-wing populist parties’ ideologies converge with those of the established parties, which leads to a decline in the level of liberal democracy. A quantitative analysis on a sample of Western-European liberal democracies will be employed. The data features evaluations by experts on the policy ideologies of parties within these countries, and the level of liberal democracy these countries hold across different points in time. Previous studies on the movement between policy ideology of established and the radical right-wing populist parties will be replicated. The data from this is then used to set it off against the levels of liberal democracy to test for its impact. This is done through the IBM SPSS data analysis software. The study finds that across the broader sample, there is no convergence between party ideologies, and the level of liberal democracy increases. When looking at every country separately, however, what is found is that the general model does not explain movement between liberal democracies and party convergence adequately. The findings present no relationship between the mainstreaming of radical right-wing populist parties and an impact on liberal democracy. Future research could focus on a couple of things to test for further interaction. The policy ideology should be weighed on the amount of votes a party received, to test for the impact the policy actually has.","['Liberal Democracy, Populism, Radical right-wing populism, mainstreaming']"

Understanding which learning strategies people use, the processes behind them, and identifying sub-optimal learning strategies could prove very beneficial for teaching people the best reinforcement learning strategies. This study examines the processes behind reinforcement learning strategies through cognitive modeling. A reinforcement learning model was fitted on human behavior on a reinforcement learning problem. Some people were able to fully solve the problem and others were not. The temporal parameter trajectories of these two groups were compared to each other. The group that solved the problem showed expected results with a lot of learning and exploration at the start and less learning and more exploitation towards the end of the task. The other group started similarly but then started to learn less while exploration remained high. This could indicate that these people would benefit from short learning sessions after which they are able to focus on something else.","['Reinforcement Learning', 'Modeling', 'Cognitive Modeling']"

The current study is focused on examining the relationship between sensitive parenting and self-control in the context of social evaluation during middle childhood, and examining whether household chaos could be found as a moderating factor in this relationship. The current study was performed within the longitudinal twin study of the Leiden Consortium Individual Development and consisted of a sub-sample of 215 participants (7-9 years old). Self-control was measured in a well-validated experimental task (the Social Network Aggression Task), parental sensitivity was measured with a parent-child interaction task (the Etch-a-Sketch) and household chaos was measured by a parent report questionnaire (the Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale). No relationship was found between sensitive parenting and self-control in the context of social evaluation. Also household chaos was not found as a moderating factor. This study contributes to a better understanding of what factors influence this less studied type of self-control, suggesting that besides parental influences additional factors such as peer influences may play a bigger role on self-control in a social context in middle childhood.","['Self-control', 'Parental Sensitivity', 'Household Chaos', 'Middle Childhood', 'Social evaluation', 'Social adjustment', 'Social Competence']"

The focus is on Taiwanese women with a first generation migrant background, who live here and are married or in a registered partnership (who are long-term migrants, or have the intent and probability to become so). This migrant group comprised a total of 884 women in 2019 (CBS 2019). In this qualitative research six women, with various backgrounds in terms of migration history, age, household and occupation, serve as main interlocutors. Through the expression of memory they contest and renegotiate their socio-cultural identity. This research showcases differing ways in creating senses of belonging, forming a new home in the Netherlands away from their native country, Taiwan. Other respondents and participatory observation add context and interpretation to their stories. The aim is to create a further understanding of this under researched migrant group and concerning the integration of migrants in general.",

Linking Adverse Childhood Experiences to Borderline Personality Disorder Features. The Role of Attachment Anxiety and Perceived Social Support,"Zdravkovic, Monika",['Dr. Annegret Krause-Utz'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) have been consistently mentioned as risk factor for the development of borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, the exact developmental pathways, as well as the question how the severity and type of abuse and neglect are related to different features of BPD, are still not well understood. An important underlying mechanism might be an insecure attachment, while perceived social support is believed to function as protective factor. Thus, the present study examined the predictive effects of distinct ACE on individual BPD features, and the role of attachment anxiety and perceived social support in linking ACE to BPD. Questions were investigated using multivariate, mediation, and moderated mediation analyses in a large, diverse sample of international participants (N = 1966). Differential effects of distinct ACE were found with emotional abuse demonstrating the strongest effects on all four BPD features. Attachment anxiety mediated the relationship, while no moderated mediation effect in combination with perceived social support was observed. Given these findings, the prevention of ACE seems critical and should be regarded as first-line intervention in stopping the vicious cycle of BPD symptom manifestation. Still, adequate treatment with a focus on developing secure attachment could be beneficial to counterbalance the effects of ACE.","['Adverse Childhood Experiences', 'Borderline Personality Disorder Features', 'Attachment Anxiety', 'Perceived Social Support']"

Nonsuicidal Self-Injury in Young People with a History of Childhood Adversity: The Role of Friendship and Resilient Functioning,"Calista, Saphire",['Maximilian Scheuplein'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Around 70% of young people that engage in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) have attempted suicide at least once. NSSI has become one of the most concerning behaviors in young people, and having experienced childhood adversity increased the risk of NSSI. Therefore, it is important to find protective factors against NSSI in young people with a history of childhood adversity. This thesis looked into the interaction between resilient functioning, friendship quality, and NSSI, and investigated if resilient functioning and friendship quality could reduce NSSI in young people with a history of childhood adversity. 72 young people, aged 16-26 years, who were exposed to childhood adversity before the age of 16 years were included in the study. They were asked to fill out online assessments about psychosocial functioning, childhood adversity history, friendship quality, and NSSI. The results showed that higher resilient functioning was related with a greater tendency of NSSI, and higher friendship quality was associated with a lower tendency of NSSI in young people with a history of childhood adversity. The relationship between resilient functioning and NSSI was not moderated by the friendship quality. Friendship is an important factor to buffer the negative effect of childhood adversity and reduce NSSI in young people. It can be valuable to add friendship in the intervention related to NSSI in young people with a history of childhood adversity.","['Nonsuicidal Self Injury', 'Childhood Adversity', 'Resilience', 'Resilient functioning', 'Friendship']"
De Relatie tussen Sociale Media Gebruik en Daderschap van Cyberpesten en de rol van Gender.,"Wessels, Hanna","['Harmelen, A. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Due to the rise of the internet and social media in the 21st century, we are seeing a shift in behaviours from the offline to the online world. This has both positive and negative consequences. One of these consequences is a rise in cyberbullying cases, which could lead to negative effects for victims. Therefore, it is important to research ways to prevent cyberbullying. The goal of this research paper was to investigate the relationship between social media use and perpetration of cyberbullying and what role gender plays in this relationship, thereby possibly identifying gender and social media use as possible risk factors for perpetration of cyberbullying. The study assessed self-reported social media use including sexting and cyberbullying experiences and behaviours in a sample of 120 young adults between the ages of 18 to 24 years old (N = 38 males, Mean age = 21.94). Data was analysed with a multiple regression analysis. Results showed that, for women, there was a positive relationship between social media use and the perpetration of cyberbullying. For men no such relationship was found. Our findings are in line with evolutionary and gender socialization theories that suggest women are more inclined to use indirect forms of aggression whereas men are more inclined to use direct forms. These results have implications for future research into risk factors for cyberbullying and for identifying risk factors to prevent perpetration in practice. The focus in research and in practice should not only lie in identifying individual risk factors, but also consider the importance of gender effects.","['Cyberbullying', 'gender', 'social media', 'young adults', 'interaction effect']"

Ventral striatal prediction error and reward expectancy during a monetary reward rask in youth with ADHD versus typically developing youth,"Zevallos, Carlos","['Duijvenvoorde, A.C. van', 'Ruitenberg, M.F.L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Reward processing abnormalities have been observed in individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in both behavioral and neuroimaging studies. Models of reinforcement learning in healthy individuals have laid the foundation for neurobiological theories addressing reward processing in ADHD. In healthy individuals, dopamine responses in ventral striatum (VS) gradually shift from actual rewards received (prediction error [PE]), toward cues which reliably predict such rewards (reward expectancy [RE]). Drawing on these observations, two theories posit that either low striatal dopamine (dynamic developmental theory) or failed signal shifts per se (dopamine transfer deficit theory) are behind reward-processing deficits in individuals with ADHD. However, the predicted signal abnormalities have not been examined directly. Forty-two participants with ADHD and 56 typically developing (TD) controls participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reward paradigm examining whole-task and temporal-change measures of PE and RE. Results showed that, contrary to theoretical predictions, the groups did not differ in either an overall measure of RE, or a composite index of PE-RE signal shifts. Furthermore, while overall PE activity was higher in the ADHD group (partly supporting the dopamine transfer deficit theory, which allows for high PE), observed decreases over time were similar between the groups (which was unexpected). Exploratory dimensional analyses showed that while a positive linear relationship between hyperactive/impulsive symptoms and RE was present in the full group, a quadratic (inverse U-shape) model better explained this relation in a sub-sample with currently-diagnosed ADHD, possibly supporting a model of downregulation due to higher symptoms. Finally, there were no significant associations between the index of temporal signal shifts and symptoms, or between overall PE and symptoms. In sum, results do not support the dynamic developmental theory, and only partially support the dopamine transfer deficit theory. Additionally, results suggest that overall signals, rather than dynamic changes, are better able to differentiate ADHD whether at the group level (PE) or at the individual level (RE). Increased PE in ADHD also suggests that immediate rewards (versus delayed reward anticipation cues) may be a useful strategy for interventions.","['ADHD', 'Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder', 'reward', 'youth', 'fmri', 'prediction error']"

To date, there is no consensus on which FOP nutrition label is most effective in encouraging healthy food choices. This results in uncertainty for policymakers about which nutrition labels to implement. This study tested the effect of different types of nutrition labels that differ in their directiveness on the healthiness of participants’ food choices under varying cognitive load. Our results suggest that people generally make unhealthier food choices while distracted. Further, semi-directive nutrition labels turn out to not only buffer, but actually, reverse the negative effect of distraction on participants’ food choice healthiness. Further research is needed to clarify the processes underlying these findings.","['Healthy Food Choices', 'Nutrition Labels', 'Cognitive Load', 'Directive']"

In our study we investigated whether sex and gender identity influence the construal of power as either opportunity or responsibility in a variety of power contexts, while also examining the possible moderating role of personality traits. Power was manipulated by priming participants in a high or low power condition, by requesting them to describe a situation in which they felt powerful or powerless. There were also questions about the meaning they ascribed to that power, while their gender identity was measured by a recently developed scale. Our results showed that participants in the high power condition were more likely to construe their power as both an opportunity and a responsibility than the participants in the low power condition and that femininity is associated with the construal of power as a responsibility irrespective of the level of power. Females construed their power as a responsibility more than males only when we controlled for neuroticism, openness to experience and their stability of power.

Sharing rather than caring: A brief experiment into the motives of sharing misfortunes of others online.,"Steliou, Panayiota",['Marco van Bommel'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In this study we were interested in seeing what factors influence whether people share videos of a misfortune online. Previous research has pointed out a relationship between schadenfreude, sharing, deservingness and envy and explored the link between social stereotyping and scha- denfreude. Therefore, the present study (N= 150) explored whether the two dimensions of the Stereotype Content Model, warmth and competence have an effect on schadenfreude and whether schadenfreude is related to sharing videos. We also tested whether competence and warmth are related to schadenfreude through envy, deservingness, and expectancy. Results showed that schadenfreude is related to sharing videos. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that high competence and low warmth elicit schadenfreude. Additionally, unlike we anticipated competence and warmth did not lead to deservingness and envy. However, a main effect of high competence on expectancy was found which states that perceiving a person as highly competent leads to more expectancy of their misfortune. Finally, this research concludes that people find it pleasing when highly competent and cold individuals go through a bad experi- ence, and this increases their willingness to share their schadenfreude with others.","['schadenfreude, envy, deservingness, expectancy, SCM, competence, warmth, mis- fortune-individual, sharing']"
Is peer punishment needed under threat?,"Christopoulou, Anna",['Maria Lojowska'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"People are exposed to a wide range of aversive conditions, including climate change and pandemics, which can have a profound impact on individual wellbeing and communal functioning. While there is evidence suggesting that exposure to threat and the prospect of punishment promote cooperation, the necessity of punishment in cooperation’s maintenance under threat is largely unexplored. In the current study, we examined whether the presence of threat requires less punishment to maintain cooperation. In a laboratory experiment individuals in groups of three (N=60) were exposed (or not) to the threat of electric shocks while deciding how much to contribute to the common pool. Additionally, half of the tested groups (N=30) were subjected to a peer-punishment procedure in which individuals had the option to deduct money (MU’s) from other group members’ accounts. Heart rate and skin conductance were continuously measured while participants were exposed to the aforementioned procedure. In comparison to the nothreat condition, the threat of shock resulted in a neurophysiological freezing response characterized by a reduction in heart rate and an increase in skin conductance. We find that in contrast to our expectations, threat by itself does not promote cooperation and punishment is needed in cooperation’s maintenance. Overall, our results suggest that the presence of threat does not diminish the role of punishment in increasing cooperation. Our results have implications for policy interventions designed to sustain cooperation under threat.","['threat', 'punishment', 'cooperation', 'public goods game']"

Clinicians’ way of communicating about uncertainty as predictor of experienced uncertainty and anxiety in recently diagnosed Parkinson’s Disease patients and the moderating effect of patients’ uncertainty tolerance,"Busse, Jonna","['Cuperus, A.A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is associated with many uncertainties, which may cause patients to experience uncertainty and anxiety. Clinicians’ communication about these uncertainties may affect patients’ wellbeing. Practical recommendations have been provided for how to optimally communicate uncertainty during medical consultations but these largely lack empirical support. The current research aimed to map how the use of recommended uncertainty communication (i.e., explicit statements and affective strategies) during diagnostic PD consultations predicts patients’ experienced uncertainty and anxiety. We additionally investigated whether patients’ uncertainty tolerance moderates the relationship between the use of recommended uncertainty communication and patients’ experienced uncertainty and anxiety. Methods: This prospective observational longitudinal study used both questionnaires and structured observationally coded data. The two video-recorded diagnostic consultations of every patient were observationally coded by two researchers, using a coding manual. The Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale assessed patients’ uncertainty tolerance. Patients’ experienced uncertainty and anxiety were assessed at four different time points (prior to and after the diagnostic consultations) using the Mishel Uncertainty of Illness Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Index respectively. Results: 22 PD patients (6 females) were recruited (mean age = 76, SD = 10). Multiple regression analyses showed that patients’ experienced uncertainty was only related to the use of recommended uncertainty communication directly after the second consultation (F(2,15) = 5.158, p = .020). Only higher ratios of affective strategies contributed to this predictive relationship (t = 3.109, p = .007), not higher ratios of explicit statements (t = 0.612, p = .550), suggesting that a greater use of affective strategies by the clinician during both consultations is related to a bigger decrease in patients’ experienced uncertainty after the second consultation. Other multiple regression analyses showed no significant relationships between recommended uncertainty communication and patients’ anxiety. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed that patients’ uncertainty tolerance did not moderate any effects. Discussion: These findings suggest that clinicians’ use of affective strategies when communicating uncertainty during diagnostic PD consultations reduces patients’ feelings of uncertainty. No relationship between recommended uncertainty communication and patients’ anxiety was found. The small sample size, Covid-19 pandemic, other personality factors and limitations of the observational coding might have affected these results. Additional research should expand knowledge about the effects of recommended uncertainty communication taking other personality traits and situational factors into consideration. Practical implementation of these results should improve PD patients’ care.","['Uncertainty communication', ""Parkinson's Disease"", 'PD', 'Neurology', 'Medical consultation']"

The Impact of Rejection Sensitivity on Self-Esteem Fluctuations in Response to Social Feedback,"Ehlers, Klarissa","['Will, G.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Fluctuations in self-esteem help us monitor social acceptance and potential social threats, such as rejection. However, how people interpret and react to social acceptance and rejection depends on individual differences in how sensitive people are to rejection. Highly rejectionsensitive individuals anxiously expect, readily perceive and overreact to rejection. This study examined how individual differences in rejection sensitivity modulate self-esteem fluctuations in response to social feedback. Participants (n = 190; age - range = 17 - 38) performed a task that entailed receiving acceptance and rejection feedback from raters who differed in their propensity to provide acceptance feedback. Participants were asked to indicate whether they expected the raters to like them and repeatedly reported on their momentary self-esteem after receiving feedback. The findings indicate that self-esteem increased in response to acceptance feedback and decreased in response to rejection feedback, and these effects were exacerbated when rejection was unexpected. Further analyses with a subset of participants (n = 165; age - range = 17 - 31) who completed a rejection sensitivity questionnaire revealed a potential mechanism through which rejection sensitivity may give rise to psychopathology. In addition to expecting rejection more often than participants with low rejection sensitivity levels, highly rejection-sensitive participants showed larger decreases in self-esteem in response to rejection and larger increases in self-esteem in response to acceptance feedback. This sensitivity may exacerbate declines in self-esteem in response to rejection instances in their day-to-day interactions, making them more vulnerable to developing persistent low self-esteem and, ultimately, mental health issues.","['rejection sensitivity', 'social feedback', 'self-esteem', 'social evaluation', 'acceptance', 'sociometer']"

It was hypothesised that a high motivation to garden, a strong wish to have a greener garden and their interaction had a positive effect on past greening behaviour and current greening intentions. Furthermore, it was expected that social, ecological and personal/practical gardening motivations would differ in their influence on current greening intentions and past greening behaviour. Results indicate that current greening intentions are significantly predicted by the motivation to garden, the garden wishes and their interaction. Explaining past greening behaviour was judged difficult due to a non-normal distribution of past greening behaviour scores. When investigating the three gardening motivation types, results indicated that an ecological motivation to garden significantly explained current greening intentions, but not past greening behaviour.","['motivation', 'gardening', 'leiden']"
De Effectiviteit van Interventies bij Jongeren met een Antisociale Gedragsstoornis,"Terlage, Hannah Rhodé","['Aghajani, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"There is a growing need for scientific knowledge concerning treating youth who misbehave. This literature review aims to generate a complete overview of available literature regarding conduct disorder in youngsters. This study looks into the various effective interventions for treating conduct disorder and callous-unemotional traits. Also, this study generates an overview for interventions per subfield, namely for social, psychological and psychopharmaceutical interventions. Only literature with a (quasi-) experimental research design has been considered helpful to minimalize the chances of distortion of the literature. Studies with a strong or exclusive focus on comorbidity or other diagnoses apart from conduct disorder or callous-unemotional traits are not included in this review. Results conclude that rewards are more effective than (harsh) punishments, structured group sessions result in positive behavioural changes in youth, and interventions directed at altering and improving parental skills flow through more positive child behaviour and decreased of callous-unemotional traits. Parental warmth and responsiveness seem to be especially important because harsh physical punishments decrease as time goes by and, therefore, a child’s problematic behaviour and callous-unemotional traits as well. Also, general and preventive interventions have positive results for most youngsters irrespective of having a diagnosis. The use of medication should be reserved for youth with persistent and long-term aggressive behaviour. Certain medication is effective; however, it should be used as a complementary component of treatment. One should not solely rely on medication administration in the treatment of conduct disorder and callous-unemotional traits. Furthermore, results show that a minimal number of studies have been dedicated to a conduct disorder on its own. Most of the studies have been found to comprise multiple disorders in youngsters. More research should be dedicated to discovering effective elements in interventions solely for a conduct disorder.",

The current study addresses this issue by researching the relationship between general insight, emotional insight, and intrinsic motivation (i.e., one’s clear understanding of thoughts, feelings, behavior, and emotions), thereby researching individual differences in how internal thought processes are regulated in interaction with the social context. The study involved 61 students of age 8 to 13 years (fifth to eighth grade), attending the Primary Years Program (P.Y.P) originated from the International Baccalaureate (IB) program. Mixed methods research is conducted – both quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed. The quantitative research includes questionnaire responses for general insight, emotional insight, and intrinsic motivation. The qualitative research involved semi-structured interviews, comparing the students’ ability for general insight and emotional insight between 5th – 6th grade and 7th – 8th grade. Using the multiple regression analysis, the quantitative results indicate there is no relationship between general insight and intrinsic motivation. However, an association was found between emotional insight and intrinsic motivation. The quantitative results suggest that students’ capacity for general insight and emotional insight is age-related, as the older students had a better understanding of their thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and emotions, and the analysis of such was more in-depth and elaborate in comparison to the younger students. These findings show that the role of internal processes is more essential in the elicitation process of intrinsic motivation than has typically been accorded for, contributing to a further understanding of antecedents affecting students’ motivation.","['Intrinsic Motivation', 'Insight', 'Emotions', 'Self-Determination Theory']"
To what extent is parenting behavior in everyday life associated with negative affect in adolescents? And what is the role of parental attachment?,"van Asten, Lisa",['Loes Janssen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Adolescence is a sensitive period for the onset of internalizing problems. Previous studies showed that internalizing problems in adolescence may stem from lack of parental warmth and critical parenting. However, most research between parenting and adolescent well-being is based on longitudinal designs, that do not account for the dynamic nature of daily parenting processes and the daily fluctuations in the adolescent affective states. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate to what extent perceived critical parenting and lack of parental warmth of both fathers and mothers are associated with negative affect of adolescents in daily life. Parental attachment was included to investigate the influence of attachment on the link between (negative) parenting behaviour and negative affect. The sample consisted of 80 Dutch adolescents (Mage = 15.90, 63.7% female) who completed ecological momentary assessments for a total of 14 days (4 surveys a day). The multi-level regression models showed that adolescents experienced significantly more negative affect on days when parents showed more criticism or less warmth. In addition, no significant interaction-effect was found between attachment and daily parental criticism from father and mother on adolescent's negative affect. Parental attachment only influences the association between lack of daily parental warmth from fathers and adolescent negative affect. The results showed that daily warmth from father has a stronger positive influence on adolescent negative affect when adolescents had a more secure attachment to their father. In addition, no significant interaction effect was found between attachment with mother and mother's warmth on adolescent's negative affect. These current findings could aid in developing new parental interventions to prevent internalizing problems in adolescents.","['negative affect', 'parenting behavior', 'adolescents', 'daily life', 'attachment']"

Current research investigates the relationship of age, sex and competence on externalizing behaviour to see whether these factors have led to behavioural change. The dataset of the Preventive Intervention Team Amsterdam was used and the sample consists 211 participants (171 boys and 40 girls) between the ages of six and twelve years old, living in Amsterdam. To measure the degree of externalizing problem behaviour, the Teachers Report Form was used, whereby children were eligible to participate in the interventions if their score was found to be (sub)clinical. In this study, no effect was found in the average externalizing behaviour between children with a low and high competence perception and between children ages six to nine and nine to twelve years old. In addition, it was found that age does not moderate the effect of competence perception on externalizing behaviour. In conclusion, age, sex and competency perception explain only a small part of the variance in externalizing behaviour. The results of this study show that there is no moderation effect of age on the association of competence perception and externalizing behavior. The findings suggest that further research into other factors that predict behaviour change is important to make the interventions of the Preventive Intervention Team even more effective.

Does the character trait neuroticism predict healthy individuals’ attentional bias towards visual itch stimuli? A meta-analytic approach to dot-probe studies on itch,"Wanrooij, Olga","['Van Laarhoven, A.I.M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Itch can produce significant problems and diminish quality of life because it requires a great deal of attention. The studies conducted on attentional bias towards itch differ greatly in results. The primary aim of the current meta-analysis is to determine the overall extent of attentional bias towards visual itch stimuli which healthy individuals display when measured with the dot-probe task. A secondary aim is to investigate how strongly the individual character trait neuroticism predicts attentional bias towards itch in healthy individuals. In total, 563 healthy participants from seven different studies had been included in this meta-analysis for the first hypothesis, and 408 healthy participants from five studies for the second hypothesis. The main findings of the present meta-analysis do not support the notion that healthy individuals display attentional bias towards itch pictures and words (ES = 0.76, SE = 3.43, t (4.27) = 0.22, P = 0.835, 95% CI: -.3.39 to 4.04). Furthermore, it does not support the notion that individuals who score higher on neuroticism have an attentional bias towards itch pictures and words (ES = 0.33, SE = 0.38, t (326.33) = -0.88, P = 0.381, 95% CI: -3.24 to 3.87). This meta-analysis leads to prospective directions to further explore different factors of attentional bias towards itch stimuli. Future researchers need to investigate whether itch stimuli may potentially be biased in patients with chronic itch. Furthermore, studies are needed to investigate whether attentional bias is not reflected in these studies and how the differences in results are caused, for instance by researching other character traits.","['itch', 'attentional bias', 'neuroticism', 'dot-probe task', 'healthy participants', 'meta-analysis', 'systematic review']"

One performance monitoring process, the error-related negativity (ERN), consists of a negative deflection that peaks around 50-70ms after a mistake is made. ERN abnormalities have been observed in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Hence, enhanced ERN amplitudes have been proposed as an endophenotype for OCD. The present study consists of a between- and within-groups design aimed to investigate the relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OC; as measured by the OCI-R questionnaire) and the ERN amplitudes of healthy participants while immersed in two different social contexts (i.e., harmful vs. non-harmful condition). The experiment utilizes a novel social variant of the Flanker’s task, the error responsibility task (ERT), where the participants were informed that a confederate would hear either a harmful or non-harmful sound when they commit a mistake. 24 healthy participants (N=24) with high (n=11) and low OC (n=13) symptoms performed the ERT while their event-related potentials were measured. A general linear repeated measures model was utilized for analysis. Three hypotheses were studied: (1) the high OC trait group will exhibit enhanced ERNs overall (p=.975), (2) enhanced ERNs will be observed for harmful vs. non-harmful mistakes (p=.057), (3) high scorers will display enhanced ERNs from non-harmful to harmful mistakes (p=.706). The findings highlight the importance of conducting ERN research in social contexts and methodological limitations and future directions are discussed.","['ERN, OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder']"
To evolve from victim into survivor: Examining the impact of psychological resilience on the relationship between childhood trauma and PTSD symptoms,"Pronk, Nancy","['Tollenaar, M.S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Adults who have experienced trauma in their childhood risk having a wide range of mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, there may be protective factors that could explain why not all victims develop psychopathology in adulthood. One of these potential factors is ‘psychological resilience’: a cognitive process that determines if an individual is able to bounce back from a negative experience through flexible adaptation. The current study aims to examine the relationship between childhood trauma and PTSD symptoms, along with the possible moderating impact of psychological resilience on this relationship. This was investigated with a cross-sectional design, by means of an online selfreport questionnaire performed by 26 Dutch women aged 25 to 62 years of whom most had experienced some type of trauma. The data was collected using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SR), the PTSD Checklist for DSM-V (PCL-5) and the Resilience Evaluation Scale (RES). The results of a multiple regression analysis demonstrated that, as expected, women who experienced more childhood trauma showed an increased amount of PTSD symptoms (R² = .614, p ≤ .000), and that women with a higher level of resilience showed a lower amount of PTSD symptoms (R² = .74, p ≤ .000). However, resilience cannot be considered as a moderator of the relationship between childhood trauma and PTSD symptoms, as the interaction between childhood trauma and resilience was not significant (p = .179). Instead, the study did find that women who experienced more childhood trauma show lower levels of resilience (r = -.574, p = < .005). The current study recommends future studies to examine what exact role resilience has in the relationship between childhood trauma and PTSD symptoms. In addition, it emphasizes to boost resilience in victims of childhood trauma, because it may decrease the likelihood of developing PTSD symptoms in adulthood.","['Childhood trauma', 'domestic violence', 'peer support', 'women', 'resilience', 'post-traumatic stress disorder']"

The current study examined whether a digital antibullying intervention could enhance the motivation of adolescents. It was expected that adolescents who received a digital anti-bullying intervention would be more motivated than adolescents who received a non-digital intervention. The current study also looked into the influence of academic motivation and sex on this relation. A post-test design was used. The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory measured motivation for the intervention and the Self-Regulation Questionnaire-Academic measured academic motivation. A sample of 17 Dutch adolescents in the second year of secondary school, between the ages of 13 and 15, was divided in two groups; a group that followed a digital intervention (N = 7, 28.5% boys) and a group that received a non-digital intervention about bullying (N = 10, 70% boys). The digital intervention and the used questionnaires were based on the self-determination theory. No differences in motivation were found between the conditions. The effect of the digital intervention on motivation was not different for sex, however a large effect size was found for this interaction. The effect was also not different for people with a different initial academic motivation. Therefore all three hypotheses were rejected. Future research can look further into the effects of a digital intervention on motivation within a larger and more diverse sample size, because this study lacked power and external validity. Enrichment of digital interventions could happen with the use of gamification or virtual reality. It is concluded that there might be individual differences in how adolescents experience digital interventions and therefore no effect has been found. It is recommended to take these differences into account in future research, by looking into customization possibilities for a digital anti-bullying intervention.",['media anti-bullying digital intervention motivation selfdetermination theory adolescent intrinsic']

Zo kon het verband worden onderzocht tussen het relatief aantal voorkeurstemmen dat de parlementariër kreeg uit die regio en het aantal vragen dat hij ten behoeve van die regio stelde. Daarnaast zijn de positie (coalitie/oppositie), de lijstzekerheid, de link met de regio en de expertise van de parlementariër als variabelen toegevoegd aan de dataset om het effect van die variabelen op het aantal vragen in de analyse mee te kunnen nemen. De conclusie luidt dat voorkeurstemmen uit een regio een positief significant effect hebben op het aantal ten behoeve van die regio gestelde parlementaire vragen.","['Voorkeurstemmen', 'parlementaire vragen', 'regionale vertegenwoordiging', 'Nederland']"
Beware of the Mean Jury: A Thesis on the Effect of Parental Verbal Threat Information on Child Fear Beliefs About Strangers,"Berg, Esmée van den",['Dr. Evin Aktar'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by a persistent and intense fear about social situations. SAD constitutes potential risk for future academic- and work life. SAD is also known for its high rates of comorbidity with other mental disorders. Previous literature stated that parental verbal threat information has an effect on child fear acquisition of novel animals. The verbal learning effect is also investigated in social situations, mixed results were found in these studies. The current study investigated the effect of parental verbal threat information on children’s fear beliefs in social situations, and explored a potential moderation of this effect by individual child social anxiety levels. Children aged 11-14 (N = 69) participated in three social tasks twice, with two strangers: performing a speech, watching the speech back and having an interaction about the speech with the stranger. Before the social tasks, parents provided negative or positive information about each of the strangers. Following the social tasks, children reported fear in a fear beliefs questionnaire about each stranger. Results indicate that children reported more fear beliefs to the stranger paired with parental threat versus safety information. Children with higher levels of pre-existing social anxiety reported more fear beliefs in general, whereas the effect of parental verbal information did not differ as a function of child levels of social anxiety. Based on the results, we conclude that parental verbal information influences children’s fear beliefs in social situations, making it an important component to include in parental treatment and prevention programs for SAD.","['parental verbal information, fear beliefs, social anxiety, strangers, adolescents']"

"The importance of self-perceived abilities in education. A study on the relation between gender-based differences in school performance and self-perceived ability in mathematics, language, and geography.","Bariagaber, Lea",['Prof. dr. J. Mesman'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Gender differences in academic performance have been debated for decades, mainly due to inconsistencies in research findings. It is prevalent that boys achieve higher grades in masculine subjects and girls perform better in feminine subjects. This study aims to determine how these gender differences in school performance are related to self-perceived abilities. Moreover, it investigates whether the self-perceived abilities differ for boys and girls depending on the subject and whether it could explain the prevalent gender differences in school performance. In this context, self-perceived ability is defined as a judgment of personal capacity to execute given types of educational assignments. To test the hypothesis that gender is related to school performance and corresponding self-perceived ability mediates this relation, Dutch families with teenage children were home visited. In the home visits, among other things, questionnaires were conducted. About 95 families participated and provided information concerning recent school grades of their children and self-perceived abilities. The study chose three academic subjects: mathematics (typically coded masculine), language (typically coded feminine), and geography (neutral) to investigate. Three mediation analyses were performed to examine the relation between gender, self-perceived abilities, and school performance. Self-perceived abilities partly mediated the relation between gender and academic performance in language but not for mathematics and geography. Although not all hypotheses were confirmed, this study is an eye-opener for possibly creating more understanding of the emergence of gender differences in school performance. School performance has been considered a precondition for later academic success and, more generally, pursuing successful life paths. Therefore, the educational system should encourage opportunities in learning regardless of student gender. More future studies on the subject should be engaged.","['School performance', 'gender', 'self-perceived ability', 'mathematics', 'language', 'geography']"
"Volunteer Recruitment in non profit organizations: Effects of communicating about organizational morality, organizational warmth and social identity value on willingness to join the organization among people that have different identity characteristics than existing volunteers of the organization","Aksoy, Nasmina",['Edwin Boezeman'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study used a social identity approach to examine how non-profit organizations (NPOs) may motivate people that have different identity characteristics than their existing volunteers to become a new volunteer for the organization. It was proposed that for this target group recruitment messages of NPOs that address positive social identity characteristics would instill feelings of anticipated respect and organizational trust, and via these mediators would increase willingness to become a volunteer, positive word of mouth, and organizational attractiveness. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a study with a 4-cell between-subjects experimental design (organizational morality, organizational warmth, communications about the social identity value vs. control condition). Our sample consisted of members of the general public, recruited through Academic Prolific, that were visibly different from the volunteers of the organization presented (N = 184). Analysis of variance first showed that the manipulations of organizational warmth and communications about social identity value were successful, while the manipulation of organizational morality didn’t work. Further, analysis of variance revealed that perceptions of organizational warmth lead to organizational trust and anticipated respect, while communications about social identity value only triggered feelings of anticipated respect. Mediation regression analysis showed that recruitment messages underlining organizational warmth lead to organizational attractiveness perceptions via both mediators, and lead to positive word of mouth through organizational trust. Communications about social identity value lead to positive word of mouth via anticipated respect. No indirect link between positive characteristics and willingness to become a volunteer was found. Theoretical and practical contributions, limitations, and suggestions for new research are discussed.","['Volunteer Recruitment', 'Social Identity Value', 'Organizational Morality', 'Organizational Warmth', 'Organizational Attractiveness']"

The online research, for which non-volunteers who have atypical social identities were recruited as research participants via the Academic Prolific Online Platform (n = 184), had a 4-cell between subjects’ experimental design (organizational warmth, organizational morality, communications of social identity value versus ‘Wikipedia information’ control condition). The participants were presented the US Fire Brigade as type of non-profit organization, were thereafter randomly allocated across the experimental conditions, and subsequently completed a questionnaire that recorded the variables of the research. The data was analyzed using one-way ANOVAs and multiple mediating regressions analyses. ANOVAs showed that the manipulations of organizational warmth and the organizational communications about the value of social identity were successful, but also that the manipulation of organizational morality was not successful. Subsequently, a one-way ANOVA showed that organizational warmth and the organizational communications about the value of social identity instilled trust in the organization and sense of psychological safety in the participants.

The Short-Term Political Outcomes of Protests: A Comparative Case Study of the Social Uprisings in Chile and Colombia from 2019 and 2020,"Löpelt, Sarah","['Moos, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In late 2019, Chile and Colombia witnessed mass protests of historic dimensions that united different generations, ideologies, and sectors of civil society in their dissatisfaction with their governments, the current neoliberal model, its socio-economic policies and malaises like inequality, poverty, and violence. The mostly peaceful and brutally repressed protests vary in their immediate political outcomes. While the Chilean case can be considered a success story, which achieved the start of a constitutional reform process, Colombia’s protests did not induce any significant political transformation. Why do protests with similar characteristics lead to different short-term political outcomes? Applying a comparative case study of the most-similar cases of the 2019-2020 mass protests in Chile and Colombia, this study argues that classic explanations regarding endogenous and exogenous variables of social movements fall short of explaining these different outcomes. Instead, this article suggests that short-term protest “success” and “failure” can be better explained by a society’s history of repression and its consequences for collective experience with protest mobilization. This proposed hypothesis is based on a theoretical framework combining social movement literature and research on the repression-mobilization relationship and is examined in a document analysis of material from a wide array of sources on the protests.","['Protest', 'Political Outcomes', 'Social Movement', 'Chile', 'Colombia', 'Repression']"

Women as Battlegrounds: A Critical Discourse Analysis on the Notion of Gender in Ethnicity during the Indian Constituent Assembly Debates on Abducted Women,"Voppen, Yvet",['Mos M.'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"During the partition, more than twelve million people crossed the border to reach Pakistan or India, soon communal violence roared in which women, out of revenge and hatred, became the victim of sexual violence at the hands of the other ethnic community. One of the major issues plaguing women was the widespread abductions of women by men from the other ethnic community in which many women were stuck on the other side of the border. Soon after, an interdominion agreement was drafted to recover abducted women from Pakistan to India and vice versa. In 1949 this agreement was discussed again to be renewed and possibly amended. The Constituent Assembly transcript of this debate that lasted for four days has been used to investigate through critical discourse analysis which roles of women within ethnicity are reproduced and to what extent. This thesis has used the framework from Anthias and Yuval-Davis to define those roles. Women's roles as boundaries, signifiers of difference, and biological reproducers become highly visible in the debate and most of all point to one issue: the lack of autonomy and representation of the voices of abducted women. Moreover, while the distinct roles of Anthias and Yuval-Davis are helpful, they lack a relational approach to the prescribed roles of women and men.","['Gender', 'women', 'abduction', 'ethnicity', 'nationalism', 'partition', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'critical discourse analysis']"
Vriendschappen en Mentale Gezondheid voor en tijdens de COVID-19 pandemie van adolescenten met nare jeugdervaringen,"Walhout, Janine","['van Harmelen, A-L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Background: The measures concerning COVID-19 may increase Mental Health problems and decrease Friendship Quality. It is unclear how the measures around COVID-19 affect adolescents who are already at risk of Mental Health problems and who benefit from good Friendship Quality; adolescents with a history of childhood adversity (CA). Research is required to see how Mental Health and Friendship Quality possibly changes during the COVID-19-pandemic. Insight into this relationship can contribute to the improvement of care for adolescents with CA who struggle with Mental Health problems and Quality of Friendship. Methods: We recruited adolescents (N = 76, M_age= 22,41, SD = 2,68)who have experienced CA from the Resilience after Individual Stress Exposure(RAISE) which filled in a questionnaire before the lockdown(October 2019), in the first lockdown(April 2020) and during the relaxation of the COVID-19-measures(July 2020). The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire(MFQ) measured Mental Health and the Cambridge Friendship Questionnaire(CFQ) measured Friendship Quality. Results: The findings confirmed that Friendship Quality increased between October 2019 and April 2020(1, 70) = 8,032 p = .006). Also between October 2019 and July 2020 the Friendship Quality increased (F(1, 70) = 4,757, p = .033). Mental Health problems increased during the lockdown April 2020 and during the relaxation from the measures in July 2020 compared to October 2019 (oct-apr:F(1, 70)=6,595, p=.012; oct-jul: F(1, 70)=8,289, p= .005). Friendship and Mental Health interconnect with each other; adolescents with improved Friendship Quality between October 2019 and April 2020 and between October 2019 and July 2020 also have increased Mental Health during this periods (oct-apr: β=.301; t(71) =2.608; p=.011; oct-jul: β=.418; t(72)=3.731; p<.001). Conclusions: The increased Quality of Friendship could be caused by the use of social media to keep in touch with friends. CA is a risk factor to develop mental health problems and so is COVID-19. Therefore, it is not unlikely that mental health decreases during lockdown and relaxations. The mental health problems are not solved when there are more relaxations, this could be caused by the long waiting lists for receiving mental health care and suggests that the mental health problems are long-lasting. When friendships improve, mental health problems decrease. This indicates that friendship increases the resilience of adolescents.","['Vriendschap', 'mentale gezondheid', 'covid-19', 'pandemie', 'adolescenten', 'nare jeugdervaringen', 'friendship', 'mental health', 'child adversity', 'CA']"

In addition, other studies showed that child behavioural problems is related to more aggression between siblings. This study aims to investigate the relation between psychological and physical aggression between parents and aggression between siblings and whether this is mediated by child behavioural problems. A total of 32 families participated in this study, both parents and two adolescent siblings between the ages of 10 and 18 filled in online questionnaires. To assess the aggression between adolescent siblings, an adapted version of the Sibling Version of the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2-SP) was used. The Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) was used to assess the level of psychological and physical aggression between parents and the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) was used to assess behavioural problems of both adolescent siblings. The Baron and Kenny method (1986) was used to conduct the mediation analysis. This showed that there was no indirect effect of psychological and physical aggression between parents and aggression between adolescent siblings through behavioural problems. There was however a positive relation between psychological and physical aggression between parents with child behavioural problems of both adolescent siblings and between child behavioural problems of both adolescent siblings with aggression between siblings. This study contributes to the knowledge of which factors can contribute to aggression between siblings.","['parental psychological and physical aggression', 'sibling aggression', 'child behavioural problems', 'adolescents']"

Could intolerance for uncertainty affect one's ability to unlearn a fear response?,"Brezovar, Christian","['Schomaker, Judith']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"There is research to suggest that the introduction of novel stimuli may facilitate faster extinction of conditioned fear responses. We conducted an experiment using an eye tracker to measure pupil dilation as an indicator for arousal and attempted to condition participants using nine sounds together with neutral and negative images. To investigate the effects of novelty on fear extinction, we conditioned participants (N = 32) over three conditions of novelty, familiar and omitted (control) images each during a conditioning phase and an extinction phase. A post-extinction phase also occurred within 24-hours after the extinction phase, immediately followed by a questionnaire and debriefing phase. Furthermore, participants were divided over two groups of novelty’ and ‘familiar’ scents, leading to a 3 x 3 x 2 study design. It was expected that fear extinction would be more effective when the conditioned sounds were paired with a novel rather than familiar image or the omission of an image altogether. Results from the analyses indicated conditioning occurred and that novel visual stimuli had a negative effect on pupil dilation during extinction. Furthermore, a significant correlation between IUS scores predicting larger pupil dilation in response to conditioned sounds for fearful visual stimuli was found, but not in response to novel visual stimuli. There are various potential improvements to this study that may lead to other results, for example a more balanced gender distribution within the sample as well as no missing data are advised.",
Associations between childhood emotional and physical neglect and dissociative symptoms: An exploratory study,"Kapetanou, Vasiliki",['Dr Annegret Krause-Utz & Aischa Reinken'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: It is well-established within the scientific community that dissociative symptoms represent a common consequence of childhood maltreatment. However, most studies have focused primarily on the impact of childhood abuse and the development of dissociation alone, while not also considering the effects of childhood neglect.  Aims & Objectives: The current study examined the associations between childhood emotional / physical neglect and the development of dissociative symptoms such as absorption, de-realisation, de-personalization and dissociative amnesia. Methodology: Participants were recruited through online platforms for domestic violence and asked to fill in the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the Dissociative Experiences Scale surveys. Overall, there were 410 participants with the majority consisting of females (60.4%). Results: Childhood neglect significantly predicted dissociative symptoms. Emotional neglect showed significant associations with absorption, de-realisation/de-personalisation, and dissociative amnesia. Similarly physical neglect revealed significant links with all four types of dissociative symptoms.  Conclusions: Such results confirm the relevance of childhood neglect for the experience of dissociative symptoms. Future research should employ additional clinical assessments for enhancing definition within such concepts.","['child neglect', 'emotional', 'physical', 'dissociative symptoms']"

Additionally, it was explored whether having a history of childhood maltreatment moderated this relationship. A sample consisting of 2475 participants, of whom 1881 were female and 594 were male, was recruited using convenience sampling. Participants were asked to fill in several questionnaires, among which a shortened version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS_10), a shortened version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-SF) and questions concerning the Covid-19 pandemic. Having been quarantined/ isolated and having experienced childhood maltreatment were hypothesized to be associated with a heightened perceived stress level. Further, having a history of childhood maltreatment was hypothesized to have an effect on the relation between quarantine/ isolation and perceived stress. Regression analyses revealed significant effects of both quarantine/ isolation and childhood maltreatment on perceived stress. A moderation analysis showed that this association was not moderated by childhood maltreatment. Thus, the findings confirmed the first as well as the second hypothesis. However, the third hypothesis could not be confirmed within this study. This study contributes to a growing body of research concerning mental health effects of Covid-19 measurements.

Verbale invloed van ouders op sociale angst bij kinderen,"Rijfers, Eleora","['Aktar, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Sociale angst komt bij één op de drie mensen voor en is een predictor van het vormen van een sociale angststoornis. Behandelingen met betrekking tot een sociale angststoornis zijn weinig effectief en vragen om onderzoek naar middelen om sociale angst tijdig voor te zijn. In het huidige onderzoek werd de invloed van positieve en negatieve verbale informatie, gegeven door een ouder, op sociale angst bij kinderen onderzocht in een sociale situatie met een vreemde persoon. De mate waarin de ouder sociaal angstig was, werd hierbij als mediërende rol in het onderzoek meegenomen. In het onderzoek ontving een groep kinderen (N=69), van een leeftijd (10-13 jaar) waarin sociale angst in vele gevallen zijn oorsprong heeft, positieve of negatieve informatie over twee onbekende juryleden. Zij voltooiden daarna drie sociale taken in het bijzijn van dit jurylid, waarna hun angstovertuigingen met een fear beliefs vragenlijst werden gemeten. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat kinderen meer angst rapporteerden op de fear beliefs vragenlijst wanneer zij negatieve verbale informatie over het jurylid hadden ontvangen van hun ouder, dan wanneer zij positieve informatie ontvingen. Sociale angst bij ouders bleek niet van significante betekenis te zijn op de angstovertuigingen van kinderen in ons onderzoek. We kunnen concluderen dat ouders, door middel van het geven van verbale informatie, een grote rol spelen in het ontstaan van sociale angst bij kinderen.

This study looked into whether a singular or distributional mode of thinking may cause overestimation as well. The sample consisted of 134 people. Respondents estimated the chance of side effects occurring for four frequency rates: up to 1 in 10, up to 1 in 100, up to 1 in 1,000 and up to 1 in 10,000. In the singular condition, respondents had to estimate the chance that they themselves would experience a side effect. In the distributional condition, they had to estimate that chance for ‘someone’. The mean estimates for the four frequency rates were compared between the two groups. We expected that the singular group would have lower means (i.e. overestimate less), because that group estimates for themselves. That group could be affected by optimistic bias, which has been shown to cause people to estimate their personal risk as lower as that of others. None of the group difference were significant at an alpha level of 5%. Furthermore, the results were inconclusive, as the distributional group had overestimated less for two of the four frequency rates. Oher studies have shown the effect of optimistic bias on the singular mode of thinking, but this was for general risk of negative events. Further research has to show whether this effect translates to side effect risk estimations.","['patient information', 'side-effect', 'risk assessment', 'optimistic bias']"

Overthinking dangerous stimuli: Investigating the salience network as a neurophysiological marker for depression,"Scharte, Robyn",['Melle van der Molen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Establishing risk factors for depression is crucial to ensure efficient prevention and treatment methods. Rumination has been established as a cognitive risk factor for depression. Besides cognitive markers, it is beneficial to investigate (neuro-) physiological markers as these are less susceptible to bias and subjectivity. Abnormalities in the salience network, which is responsible for the detection of internal and external salient stimuli, have been associated with depression. To date, research findings regarding this association remain controversial. This study investigates the relationship between the salience network, rumination, and depression. The self-speech task was conducted in which 79 female students, with an average age of 20.3, gave a three-minute speech which they believed was being observed by expert judges. Thereafter, participants rated their speech and received feedback from the judges. Salience network activity was measured in form of theta power with an EEG, focusing on activity after feedback receival. Results revealed that salience network activity in form of theta in response to negative feedback was not a significant predictor for depression. Rumination was not found to be a significant mediator of this relationship. However, rumination was found to be a significant predictor for depression replicating previous findings. Concluding, this study was not able to replicate previous findings of an association between the salience network and depression. Findings raise directions for future research on how to further investigate (physiological) risk factors for depression.","['Depression, Rumination, Electroencephalography, Salience Network, Negative Social Feedback']"

Research on the restorative effect of natural environments in relation to depressive symptoms may prove useful for urban populations in which depressive symptoms are relatively more prevalent while natural environments are less accessible.

An online questionnaire was used to measure depressive symptoms as well as affect and feelings of stress before and after exposure to a series of photographs of either natural or busy urban environments. Participants (N = 230) were divided in four groups based on presence of depressive symptoms (depressed, nondepressed) and type of environment (natural, urban). A Kruskal-Wallis test with post-hoc procedures was applied to assess differences between groups in affect and stress change. Results show no difference in affect and stress change between depressed and nondepressed groups. Negative affect and stress decreased in the nature condition. Positive affect decreased while stress increased in the urban condition. The findings suggest that natural environment can indeed improve affect and stress while urban environments can be detrimental, regardless of depressive symptoms.","['depression', 'affect', 'stress', 'restoration', 'nature', 'urban']"
Replacing fear with something new: using novelty to unlearn fear: What is the effect of novel environmental olfactory cues on fear extinction?,"Doesschate, Carine ten","['Schomaker, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"PTSD comes from a traumatic experience which is often re-experienced and relived, causing long-term stress. To weaken the connection with fear the extinction process is used. This is not always successful due to maladaptive fearful associations surviving the extinction. Therefore a novel aspect is added; by manipulating at stimulus level, and by manipulating the olfactory environment with a novel aspect. This study investigates if the novel aspect creates a new association, aiding in the weakening of the connection that causes fear. The reinstatement of the original context cues, when the fear was created, can cause the fear to return. This study therefore uses novelty in two ways to promote fear extinction. The participants (N=32) took part in a two day experiment were they performed different computer tasks; A working memory task, conditioning phase deciding if the scene was indoor or outdoor, extinction phase and post-extinction phase. The arousal was recorded with a subjective 9-point Likert scale and an objective eye tracker. To examine whether the olfactory environments had an effect on the arousal rate, a mixed subjects analysis of variance was conducted. It was expected that the arousal rate would decrease for the fearful stimuli in the post-extinction phase, compared to the extinction phase. Furthermore, it was expected that the novel olfactory environment would cause a stronger decrease in arousal rate for the fearful stimuli.

Loneliness and hopelessness as correlates of depressive symptoms in university students during the Covid-19 pandemic: The mediating role of resilience,"Diehl, Elisabetta Mrs",['Dr. Niki Antypa'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Covid-19 pandemic has been widely associated with an increase in depression levels in the student population. Recent studies have investigated loneliness and hopelessness as predicting factors for depressive symptoms during the pandemic. However, little research has been conducted to explore the possible mediating role of the students’ resilience in these associations. This study aimed to investigate the association between loneliness and depressive symptoms, and between hopelessness and depressive symptoms in students during the pandemic. A further aim was to investigate whether the students’ resilience played an important mediating role in both associations. University students (N=215) from Leiden University filled out an online questionnaire measuring their loneliness, hopelessness, resilience, and depressive symptoms during the Covid-19 pandemic. Two mediation analyses were conducted using Process macro in SPSS. Results showed that both loneliness and hopelessness were positively associated with depressive symptoms. Resilience was found to play a mediating role in the loneliness-depressive symptoms association. However, resilience was not confirmed as a mediator in the hopelessness- depressive symptoms association. The results of this study imply a call for universities to provide accessible resources to students that help strengthen their resilience when faced with a major stressful life event. As resilience was found to be a mediator between loneliness and depressive symptoms, strategies to increase the students’ resilience could possibly prevent loneliness from further developing into depression. Strategies should also focus on decreasing loneliness and hopelessness levels in students as those factors were found to be associated with depressive symptoms during the Covid-19 pandemic.",

On Repeat? Maladaptive Repetitive Thinking as a Moderator Between Academic Stress and Sleep Quality in Students,"Salo, Petri Mr.","['Aksungur, S.U.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Challenges in stress management, effective attention direction, and striving for adequate sleep are reflected in a student’s life and academic performance. According to recent research, decreased attentional control is related to an increased tendency to engage in maladaptive repetitive thinking (RT) i.e., rumination and worry, which has been considered as a threat to sleep quality. Furthermore, an increase in academic stress has been found to impair students' sleep quality. Using moderation analysis, the current study investigated whether maladaptive RT strengthened the relationship between academic stress and sleep quality. We used linear regression analysis (LRA) to investigate the relationship between attentional control and maladaptive RT. A number of self- report questionnaires were used in this cross-sectional study to measure attentional control, sleep quality, academic stress, worry, and rumination. The final sample consisted of 50 Leiden University students aged 17-30 years. The results of the simple LRA showed that poor attentional control is related to a higher tendency of maladaptive RT, such as rumination and worry. The result of the moderation analysis revealed that neither rumination (b = -.001, t = -0.90, p = .930) nor worry (b = - .003, t = -0.73, p = .471) strengthened the relationship between increased academic stress and poor sleep quality. Despite its limitations, the study serves as a preliminary study into the role of rumination and worry in the relationship between academic stress and sleep quality and provides methodological suggestions for future research to yield more reliable results.","['maladaptive repetitive thinking', 'rumination', 'worry', 'sleep quality', 'academic stress', 'moderation analysis']"

The case of European defence: optimism to be found in a legacy of failure?,"Petersen, Sören S","['Kinacioglu, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"European defence and security cooperation has largely remained intergovernmental in nature. Other issue areas such as the common market have been integrated and are primarily governed through EU institutions as a result. This is puzzling since the earliest efforts of European integration occurred in the field of defence and security. These efforts ultimately proved a failure and stifled further attempts at integration in this policy field for decades to come. In academic discussion, a common approach to European security and defence policy is the analysis of outcome. The pace and nature of European defence and security policy has been analysed and critiqued on frequent occasions, pointing to the still great reliance of the EU on NATO in security matters. Considering both of these aspects, this analysis aims to deliver an analysis that focusses on the process of EU defence and security policy making itself in order to investigate the puzzle of why it has remained intergovernmental. Hypothesising that it is a policy of deliberate non-decision, „gatekeeping”, by one or more actors within EU policy-making that is responsible for the intergovernmental outcome, process tracing is conducted. The findings of this analysis do not, however, corroborate the hypothesis and an alternate explanation is developed that points to a non-decision being motivated by passive factors, namely inopportune situations of the individual actors capable of propelling an integration effort forward. This analysis is, however, also able to observe that the recent push in the implementation of PESCO came about as a result of political hurdles being overcome and, in principle, a road towards integration may open up in the future.","['EU', 'Defense', 'CSDP', 'Intergovernmentalism', 'European Integration', 'NATO']"

This study investigated outgroup trust of mothers in relation to ethnic outgroup preference of Turkish-Dutch, Afro-Dutch, and White-Dutch children aged 6 to 8 years old (M = 7.44, SD = 0.97). The total sample of this study consisted of 109 Dutch, 52 Turkish-Dutch, and 39 Afro-Dutch children. The mothers were asked to complete a questionnaire about their level of trust in other ethnic groups. Child's ethnic preference was measured by showing the child photos of children with different ethnicities, and asking who they wanted to play with, sit next to, and who they would invite to their birthday party. The results showed that there was no significant relation between outgroup trust of mothers and ethnic preference of their children. In addition, it was found that belonging to the minority (Turkisch-, and Afro-Dutch) or majority (Dutch) group didn’t play a moderating role in this relation. Dutch mothers were found to show significantly more outgroup trust than Turkish-Dutch, and Afro-Dutch mothers. The Dutch children were found to show less ethnic outgroup preference than the Turkish, and Afro-Dutch children. The fact that no positive relation was found between outgroup trust of mothers, and ethnic preference of the child means that other factors may play a role in the development of ethnic outgroup preference of children. Besides more research on outgroup trust mothers, other factors should be explored to investigate about the development of children’s ethnic preferences.","['Outgroup vertrouwen', 'etnische outgroup voorkeur']"
The Relationship Between Disease-Related Anxiety and Psychological Outcomes in Cardiac Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Černáková, Romana","['Reijnders, T.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Various forms of disease-related anxiety (DRA) have shown to correlate with negative mental health outcomes in cardiovascular (CVD) patients. The aim of this article was to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between DRA and psychological outcomes in patients with CVD. A systematic literature search was performed on the 16th of April, 2021. A random-effect model meta-analyses were conducted on cross-sectional data assessing the correlations between various DRA types and psychological outcomes. Study results which were eligible for inclusion but could not be analysed statistically were described in a summary of findings. We found 20 eligible studies of mostly cross-sectional design. Twelve of these studies were included in the meta-analysis. The performed meta-analyses showed that higher levels of cardiac anxiety (CAQ total) were correlated with higher levels of general anxiety (r= 0.47, p<.001) and depression (r= 0.34, p<.001) (HADS). The same relationship was found between the three susbcales of cardiac anxiety (CAQ fear, CAQ avoidance, CAQ attention) and general anxiety (rfear= 0.50, p <.001; ravoidance= 0.19, p <.001; rattention= 0.38,p<.001) and depression (rfear= 0.40, p <.001; ravoidance= 0.32, p <.001; rattention= .31,p <.001) (HADS). Fear of movement (FactS-HF 15) was significantly, positively correlated with state anxiety (r= 0.38, p<.001) and depression (r= 0.28, p<.001) (STADI) and trait anxiety (r= 0.51, p<.001) and depression (r= 0.45, p<.001) (STADI). Finally, correlation between kinesiophobia (TSK-Heart) and general anxiety (HADS-A) was non-significant (r= 0.36, p=.224). Our findings show a connection between various types of DRA and a higher risk of psychopathology in CVD patients. While the underlying pathway cannot be seen from our results, multiple processes have been proposed in previous studies. We believe that regular DRA screening and development of disease-specific treatment may be beneficial for this patient population. However, more research is needed in order to understand this relationship as well as to assess the effectiveness of a disease-specific approach.","['disease-related anxiety', 'cardiovascular disease', 'general anxiety', 'depression']"

“Meedoen” in society: a matter of economic participation or sharing cultural norms? Civic integration policy in the Netherlands through the lense of nationalism,"Hamelink, Melissa",['Vasiliki Tsagkroni'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Migrant integration has become a pressing policy concern ever since governments perceived an economic, political, and social distance between the migrant groups and native citizens, which resulted in a backlash against multicultural approaches. In Western Europe, this has led to a civic integration approach, which aims to hand civic tools to migrants in order to emancipate them to participate within the receiving society. Through integration procedures, courses and contracts the policies aim to establish social inclusion of immigrants. These civic integration policies often share the demand of the adoption of values rooted in liberal, democratic principles but at the same time take on different shapes depending on the political and historical context. While scholars largely agree on the existence and differing shapes of civic integration policies, only few consider it as a form of nationalism. This research interrogates what notions of national identity and the role of immigrants in society are apparent in both civic integration policies as well as related political discourses. Exploring how, in what context, and by whom notions of the Dutch identity and integration are discursively deployed in parliamentary debates, this research aims to shed light on the relationship between liberal values and nationalist narratives. I argue that references to moral universal and liberal principles within the debate of integration policy can be understood as a part of a broader civic nationalist narrative and sometimes shows aspects of cultural nationalism. This thesis considers the distinction between civic and cultural nationalism as ambiguous and illustrates that the intertwinedness of the two concepts can explain the transition from multiculturalism to a rejection of this approach. This research finds that civic and cultural nationalist narratives can coexist.","['civic integration', 'civic nationalism', 'cultural nationalism']"

Although mortality rates have been declining in recent decades, CVD still represents a severe threat to patients’ health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Patients who develop comorbid disease-related anxiety are at increased risk for worse disease progression and impaired HRQoL. The purpose of this paper was to review the current scientific evidence and to perform a meta-analysis on the relationship between disease-related anxiety and clinical health outcomes in patients with CVD. Due to an insufficient number of studies, our analysis focused on the relationship between cardiac anxiety and HRQoL. The literature was searched for eligible articles published by September 2021 on eight online databases. Data extraction revealed 12 observational studies eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Of those, 4 articles (including 985 patients) fulfilled the criteria to be included in the meta-analyses, which examined the association between cardiac anxiety and both physical and mental HRQoL, respectively. Under the random-effects model, we found a significant and negative correlation between cardiac anxiety and physical HRQoL (r = -0.53: 95% CI [-0.57, -0.48; p < .001]). Additionally, we found a significant and negative correlation of small-to-moderate strength between cardiac anxiety and mental HRQoL (r = -0.43: 95% CI [-0.50, -0.35; p < .001]). These results implicate that, on average, patients with CVD experience lower levels of both physical and mental HRQoL with increasing levels of cardiac anxiety. Our findings further suggest that routine screenings should be implemented in clinical practice to identify and potentially treat at-risk patients. Future research on the cause-and-effect of these relationships is warranted.","['cardiovascular disease', 'disease-specific anxiety', 'cardiac anxiety', 'kinesiophobia', 'cardiac rehabilitation']"
The Role of Oxytocin and Empathy in Social Conformity: Investigating Influencing Factors on Conformity while Controlling for Regression to the Mean,"Sternberg, Tomas Stavros","['Jansen, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Aligning one’s behavior with others with the goal of fitting in or gaining accurate information, often in contrast to one’s own beliefs, is called social conformity. Social conformity has been a topic of research in the literature, however conditions and factors which influence conformity are still under investigation. This study investigates the hormone Oxytocin and the trait empathic perspective-taking as potential influences on conformity- processes. Oxytocin may enhance conformity-processes based on the literature. A hallmark of the study is that we correct for regression-to-the-mean, to which paradigms measuring participants exactly twice may be vulnerable. As part of a larger project, 80 healthy male participants rated the trustworthiness of faces. After rating each face, participants were displayed an imaginary group-rating of the average European student. After a distraction-task and being administered either Oxytocin or a placebo, they had to re-rate the faces without being displayed the group-rating. Conformity was inferred when participants altered their ratings after being presented with the group-rating. To control for regression-to-the-mean, a control-group of 30 healthy males underwent the same experiment, without being presented with the group-rating or being administered Oxytocin. Results showed a statistically significant effect for group-rating, suggesting that participants altered their rating after seeing the group-rating. No interactions between group-ratings and either Oxytocin or empathic perspective-taking were found. After controlling for regression-to-the-mean, the effect-size of group-rating was substantially reduced, suggesting an influence of regression-to-the-mean on uncontrolled results. Further, the study makes recommendations for future research with regard to investigating conformity-processes in similar paradigms.","['social conformity', 'oxytocin', 'empathy', 'regression to the mean']"
"Langer zitten, meer vragen: Een onderzoek naar de anciënniteit van Kamerleden in relatie tot het gebruik van parlementaire instrumenten","Sluijk, Thomas","['Otjes, S.P.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"The literature illustrates that the use of parliamentary instruments is in some cases related to the position of a Member of Parliament (MP) on the list of candidates in the upcoming election. The theory therefore assumes that performing certain activities is rewarded with a high position. If an MP has obtained this high position, he will therefore have to prove himself again with a view to re-selection. Based on this reasoning, it therefore appears that an MP with a long term of office is active in the use of parliamentary instruments. However, there is still a gap in the literature with regard to the relationship between the seniority of MPs and the use of parliamentary instruments. This fully quantitative analysis examined whether the length of office of an MP correlates with the use of parliamentary instruments. The parliamentary instruments examined are motions, amendments, oral parliamentary questions, written parliamentary questions and bill proposals. Subsequently, in the case of motions, amendments, written parliamentary questions and bill proposals, a distinction was made between first submitters and submitters in combination with co-sponsors. Many of these parliamentary instruments are very clearly not significant, but both oral and written parliamentary questions do have a positively significant effect with seniority. In the case of written parliamentary questions this applies to both first submitters and first submitters in combination with co-sponsors. However, in the case of written parliamentary questions, the significant effect disappears if control variables are included in the analysis. The significance effect remains for oral parliamentary questions. The results of this research may not be groundbreaking, but they do provide interesting insights into the use of parliamentary instruments in relation to seniority, especially for the case of the Dutch House of Representatives. There are also other parliamentary instruments that could be analyzed, this can be part of follow-up research.","['Kamervragen', 'Moties', 'Amendementen', 'Initiatiefwetsvoorstellen', 'Zittingstermijn', 'Zittingsduur', 'Anciënniteit', 'Herselectie', 'Nederlandse Politiek', 'Parlementaire Instrumenten']"
What Drives Prejudice?

However, thus far there has been no investigation whether individual differences in threat sensitivity can interact with political ideology to predict a person’s degree of prejudice. This work seeks to fill in this gap by examining this relation. It was hypothesized that the relation between threat sensitivity and prejudice would be moderated by political ideology. Specifically, individuals would show greater prejudice against groups holding an opposing worldview, and this would be amplified for people with a higher (versus lower) threat sensitivity. This hypothesis was tested in an online survey, with British participants (N = 200). Contrary to our prediction, the results indicate no significant interaction effect of threat sensitivity and political ideology on prejudice. Further research on threat sensitivity and political ideology is needed to investigate whether and how it may affect prejudice.","['Intergroup Prejudice', 'Prejudice', 'Threat Sensitivity', 'Political Ideology', 'Bob paradigm', 'Worldview']"
Are peace agreements destructive for a state’s quality of democracy?

The study focuses on the case of Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH), which has had a mandated peace agreement since December of 1995: the Dayton Peace Agreement. My key expectation for the research is that BiH citizens do not perceive their vote as a factor that could implement change in the electoral process and eventually incorporate their political changes through politicians and their parties. Furthermore, the consociational aspect of the state, corruption and violence may lower voter turn-out. The analysis has been executed through in-depth interviews with 12 citizens in BiH, deriving from different ethnic backgrounds and equally divided by gender, age, and voters and non-voters. The analysis has strongly brought forward a relationship between corruption and low voter turn-out. The results also show that one of the causes of citizens not heading to the ballot box is that their vote will not imply significant change. This is also because of the consociational nature within the state that uses peacebuilding and power-sharing. The presence of nationalist parties and the DPA's administration also raised issues with respondents through the analysis.","['voter turn-out', 'peace agreements', 'post-conflict', 'Bosnia and Hercegovina']"

However, a better understanding is needed on how gender roles influence power construal. This study investigated whether diverse gender identities tend to construe power differently. Furthermore, it also explored whether culture orientation – individualism and collectivism – and socioeconomic status influence the relationship between gender and power construal. It was hypothesized that: gender would not influence power construal; that individualism predicts power construed as an opportunity, and collectivism as a responsibility; and finally, that higher scores in objective and subjective measures of socioeconomic status led to power appraised as an opportunity. To test these hypotheses, gender was measured with a continuous variable. Culture orientation was assessed with four dimensions of horizontal and vertical individualism and collectivism. Lastly, objective and subjective socioeconomic status was measured by age, education, household income, and by the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status. The results demonstrated that a stronger feminine identification was associated with a stronger tendency to construe power as a responsibility. Findings concerning culture orientation and socioeconomic status confirmed the predictions. Age was also revealed as a significant predictor of power as an opportunity. The results regarding gender were interpreted in terms of social identification. Results on culture and socioeconomic status were discussed in terms of how these constructs serve as relevant social identities influencing the construal of power. Although more research is needed, the results highlight the importance of assuming power construal within specific social and economic contexts.","['power construal', 'responsibility', 'opportunity', 'gender', 'cultural orientation', 'individualism', 'collectivism', 'socioeconomic status.']"

However, the MTA was not able to initiate social movements contrary to expectations. The other benefits are found to apply. By combining constructivist theory and relative deprivation theory I argue that the MTA experienced this unprecedented participation because a constructed relative deprivation partly created by Hong Kong and adopted by participating countries such as Myanmar which was able to create shared grievances that inform participation. The grievance was with authoritarianism and China which was often equated and thus allowed for a perception of a shared grievance, ideology, and identity. Additionally, the MTA expanded on the benefits by having an internally unifying power in Myanmar and building an alternative to ASEAN. Another reason for participation is a demographic aspect. However, so far, the MTA has not managed to have the desired success.","['(#MilkTeaAlliance', 'Myanmar', 'Hong Kong', 'Online Social Movements', 'Relative Deprivation Theory)']"

"Does the Apple Fall Far From the Tree? A study on parental tolerance, preparation for bias and children's prejudice towards the White Dutch among Dutch ethnic minority groups","Roerade, Elisabeth","['Boelens, H.H.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Interethnic prejudice in children is a widely researched topic when it comes to the perspective of the White majority group on ethnic minority groups. The perspective of ethnic minorities towards the White majority group, however, has been studied less often. Especially in the Netherlands this research is rare. Inspired by social learning theory, the current study examines if there is a relationship between parental tolerance for interethnic contact and children’s ethnic prejudice towards the White majority group among families from two large ethnic minority groups (Afro-/Turkish-Dutch) in the Netherlands, and whether this relationship varies based on parents preparing children for bias. Here, we hypothesize that higher parental tolerance for interethnic contact is related to diminished prejudice of ethnic minority children towards children from the White majority group. In addition, preparation for bias is expected to weaken the relationship between parental tolerance and children’s prejudice among the ethnic minority group. This study uses data from the first wave of Leiden University's longitudinal research into the parenting origins of children’s ethnic prejudice. The study includes a subsample of 77 children aged 6 to 10 years (M = 7.8, SD = 0.99) and their mothers. The families have been recruited in the Western region of the Netherlands (Randstad) and are of Afro-Dutch and Turkish-Dutch descent. Parental attitudes were measured using questionnaires, whereas children’s ethnic prejudice was measured using an adapted version of the Preschool Racial Attitude Measure task. Using a hierarchical multiple regression analysis and controlling for children’s interethnic contact with White children, no significant relation was found (p = .22) between parental tolerance and children’s ethnic prejudice towards White children. Furthermore, this relation was not affected by high or low levels of preparation for bias (p = .25). The hypotheses were not confirmed. Relations between parental attitudes and children’s ethnic prejudice may operate differently in ethnic minority families than in White families. More research into this topic is required.",
Paying the costs of climate change: global distribution preferences and cultural dimensions,"Dijkhuis, Amber","['Stallen, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Reducing the harmful effects of climate change on the planet is one of the most important, yet challenging issues countries across the world are currently facing. Doing so requires cooperation, but collectively mitigating the effects of climate change results in a public goods dilemma in which everyone benefits, despite contributing to the costs accompanied. With this, questions regarding fairness on distributing these costs arise. This study adds to the small body of literature on solving public goods dilemmas related to climate change by examining how the six cultural dimensions defined by Hofstede (2001) correlate with the preference to pay more to reduce the effects of climate change. Doing so, the distribution preferences of 3771 participants in 51 countries were measures. The results show that long-term orientation correlates with the preference to pay more, especially for the richest set of countries. Individualism, power distance, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance and indulgence do not significantly correlate to the preference to pay more to reduce the effects of climate change, contradicting previous research on public good dilemmas and pro-environmental behavior. Implications of these findings, alongside limitations of the study and further research directions are discussed.","['Climate change, public goods dilemma, pro-environmental behavior, culture, distribution preferences']"

An online questionnaire was used to measure depressive symptoms as well as affect and feelings of stress before and after exposure to a series of photographs of either natural or busy urban environments. Participants (N = 230) were divided in four groups based on presence of depressive symptoms (depressed, nondepressed) and type of environment (natural, urban). A Kruskal-Wallis test with post-hoc procedures was applied to assess differences between groups in affect and stress change. Results show no difference in affect and stress change between depressed and nondepressed groups. Negative affect and stress decreased in the nature condition. Positive affect decreased while stress increased in the urban condition. The findings suggest that natural environment can indeed improve affect and stress while urban environments can be detrimental, regardless of depressive symptoms.","['depression', 'affect', 'stress', 'restoration', 'nature', 'urban']"
Male and Female Powerholders: Investigating the Relationship that Narcissistic Traits Play in the Interpretation of Power,"Graafland - Baaij, Rosanne","['Scheepers, D.T.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Power is not merely a structural or relational construct but also a psychological state; power influences the way an individual is inclined to act, treat others, and to make decisions. Power can be construed as a responsibility or as an opportunity and the specific construal of power determines the eventual action a powerholder will take. When it comes to positions of power, there is no shortage of individuals at powerful positions who exhibit narcissistic personality traits. This research aims to investigate the influence that narcissistic personality traits, in combination with gender, have on the construal of power. To investigate this relation the following hypothesis was formulated: Male leaders with stronger narcissistic personality traits will construe their power in an opportunistic manner significantly more than female leaders with stronger narcissistic personality traits and male leaders with low narcissistic personality traits. 250 participants with leadership positions were surveyed on gender, power construal and narcissistic traits. Results showed that narcissistic personality traits have a significant, positive effect on the construal of power as opportunity and a significant, negative effect on the construal of power as responsibility. The effect of gender was not found in this study. The results are discussed in terms of the current research and suggestions for the future. This study demonstrates that powerholders with higher narcissistic traits are more likely to interpret their power as opportunity, and less likely to interpret their power as responsibility, regardless of gender.","['power', 'gender', 'narcissism', 'narcissistic personality traits']"

We additionally examine how likely individuals are to partake in a future interaction with the avatars. Participants were presented with 6 different avatars reiterating a different story each time. Their level of anxiety was measured using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) questionnaire prior to being presented with the avatars. Afterwards, participants filled out a questionnaire including questions measuring how the individuals perceived the avatars. The results from the questionnaire were taken and examined. Our findings showed that participants with high and low social anxiety did not evaluate the virtual avatars differently, regardless if mimicry occurred or not. However, we found that level of anxiety did influence responses on the Desire for a Future Interaction (DIF) questionnaire; those with low social anxiety are more likely to score higher on the DIF questionnaire, suggesting they are more likely to be willing to interact with the avatars again. However, given that previous research has found significant effects regarding how different levels of social anxiety influence social perception, we conclude that our findings do not support this; the level of social anxiety did not influence how participants evaluate the avatars, regardless if mimicry occurs or not.","['Mimicry', 'Social Anxiety', 'Pupil Dilation', 'Virtual Reality, Virtual Avatar Evaluation', 'Desire for Future Interaction']"

Work-Life Balance Crafting Intentions Among Entrepreneurs: Do Growth Intentions and Prevention-Focus Predict It?,"Acar, Beyza",['Bramesada Prasastyoga'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis aims to investigate the antecedents of work-life balance (WLB) crafting intentions among entrepreneurs, with a specific focus on the roles of growth intentions and prevention-focus. The study hypothesized that growth intentions would negatively predict WLB crafting intentions and that the prevention-focus would positively predict WLB crafting intentions. One hundred seventy-three entrepreneurs recruited from Prolific Academic filled out an online survey. The survey consisted of questions about demographic and business information as well as scales measuring WLB crafting intentions, growth intentions, and prevention-focus. The results of a two-level hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that contradictory to Hypothesis 1, growth intentions positively and significantly predicted WLB crafting intentions. However, prevention-focus was not found to be a significant predictor of WLB crafting intentions, failing to support Hypothesis 2. The findings of this thesis suggested that entrepreneurs who had intentions to grow their businesses had more intentions to engage in WLB crafting behaviors. Subsequently, the results revealed that prevention-focused entrepreneurs did not significantly intend to engage in WLB crafting behaviors.","['work-life balance, WLB crafting intentions, growth intentions, prevention-focus, entrepreneurs']"
Perceived parenting as a predictor of social evaluation expectancy and social evaluative learning in young adults,"Mitsaki, Alkistis",['Melle van der Molen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Despite the well-established association between over-controlling and rejecting parenting and offspring social anxiety, little research has examined parental effects on cognitive biases associated with social anxiety. Social evaluation expectancy and learning biases can impede effective social interaction and contribute to the development and maintenance of social anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate how parental care and control, or the combination of maternal control and paternal care, as perceived retrospectively by young adults, affect pre-exposure social evaluation expectancy and sensitivity to learn from positive, ambiguous and negative feedback about the self. One hundred nine university students (mean age = 20.5 years) participated in a reinforcement learning task, in which they estimated pre-task social acceptance from four peer strangers and predicted if these peers would give them positive/negative feedback on their self-profile statements, based on previous feedback from each peer. A series of multiple regression analyses were employed. Results showed that neither perceived parental care and control, nor the combination of maternal control and paternal care, were predictive of social acceptance expectancy or the learning rate of positive, ambiguous and negative self-related feedback of young adults. There was only a tendency for maternal overprotection to be associated with a negative learning bias of ambiguous social feedback. These findings suggest that perceived low parental care and high parental control does not affect offspring social anxiety by making young adults less likely to hold a positive self-referential bias or more likely to hold a negative self-referential bias before and during a social interaction.","['social anxiety', 'perceived parenting', 'social evaluation expectancy', 'social evaluation learning', 'self-referential bias']"
Role of borderline personality features in the relation between childhood trauma and eating disorder symptoms,"Gülaşık, Aylin","['Krause-Utz, Annegret']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Childhood trauma (CT) has been associated with eating disorder symptoms (EDs) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) symptoms. Particularly, specific BPD features such as affective instability, impulsivity, dissociation, self-harm, are a frequent consequence of childhood trauma and co-occur with eating disorders. Previous findings suggested that symptoms of BPD could mediate the relationship between CT and EDs. The aim of this self-report study was to investigate whether there is a relationship between childhood trauma and eating disorder symptoms and whether this relationship is partly explained by borderline personality features. Methods: Four hundred and fourteen individuals completed the self-report scales on CT, BPD symptoms and EDs. Using the PROCESS macro tool, it was investigated whether there was a direct effect of CT severity on overall scores of ED symptoms as well as an indirect effect via BPD symptoms. The role of specific features of BPD were analysed in an exploratory manner. Results: Severity of CT significantly predicted EDs symptoms, also after accounting for overall borderline personality symptoms. In addition, there was a significant indirect effect of CT via overall BPD symptoms on EDs. Except for affective instability, indirect effects were found for all BPD features. Conclusion: In the context of previous findings, our results suggested that symptoms of BPD might mediate the relationship between CT and EDs. Given the correlational design of this study that cannot allow causal conclusions, experimental, longitudinal designs should be used in future research to further and deeply understand these associations.","['childhood trauma', 'borderline personality disorder', 'eating disorders', 'affective instability', 'impulsive self-harm', 'identity disturbance', 'negative relationships']"
The European Green Deal and the Lobbying Strategies of Energy Associations: A Qualitative Analysis.,"Bala, Ioanna","['Mos, M.M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The European Commission aims to tackle the climate crisis with the European Green Deal (EGD). To accomplish this task, the Commission requires expertise which interest groups are able to provide. These groups which represent private and public interests provide information through lobbying and exert influence in the policy process. This paper provides insight into the private actors' lobbying strategies concerning the Green Deal. The theoretical frameworks that will be utilized to describe the lobby strategies are the access of interest groups in European policies through their expertise, the institutional framework of the EU and the policy issue characteristics. These frameworks are explained to provide a better understanding of the empirical findings. For the empirical research, qualitative content analysis will be applied to four energy private associations’ documents that are available in the public sphere. Finally, the findings will lead the study to argue that private associations are highly active in the policy process of the EGD and they apply informative lobbying to target the European Commission. Further research in the lobbying behaviour and influence of the energy sector in the implementation of the EGD is also suggested.","['European politics', 'European Green Deal', 'european policies']"

The aim of this study was to examine the role of parental bonding, loneliness and hopelessness in the development of PTSD symptomatology in a young adult sample. Participants who study at Leiden University was asked to fill-out questionnaires about parental bonding, loneliness, hopelessness and PTSD. According to participants’ scores on parental bonding inventory (PBI), they were assigned either to secure or insecure attachment groups. A mediation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between parental bonding and PTSD symptomatology by coding hopelessness and loneliness as potential mediators in this relationship. The results revealed that insecure attachment was associated with higher levels of hopelessness, loneliness and PTSD symptomatology whereas secure attachment was associated with lower levels of hopelessness, loneliness and PTSD symptomatology. Furthermore, loneliness and hopelessness mediated the relationship between parental bonding and PTSD symptomatology. These findings could help in identifying individuals who are more or less vulnerable to develop trauma-related symptoms after a traumatic or an adverse situation.","['parental bonding', 'attachment', 'hopelessness', 'loneliness', 'PTSD']"
A Network Analysis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Its Common Comorbidities,"Soylu, Bengisu Bilge","['Fried, E.I.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) commonly co-occurs with other psychiatric conditions. In recent years, network analysis has been employed to investigate the relationship between OCD and some of its comorbidities. The objective of the current thesis was to explore the comorbidity network of OCD in relation to seven other psychiatric conditions, some of whose interactions with OCD have not been investigated by the former network analysis papers. The thesis made use of an open-source data which was collected from patients who registered to the Behavioural Health Partial (BHP) hospital program at McLean Hospital, Massachusetts between 30 November 2018–16 October 2019. The final sample consisted of 532 people. Their responses to four measures, namely Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders Dimensional Scales, Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Drug Alcohol Craving Scale were analysed using network analysis. In total, we estimated two regularized partial correlation networks. The first network consisted of eight nodes representing eight psychiatric conditions. Differing from the former network in one way, the second one represented OCD and depression at a symptom level. Network 1 showed that OCD was connected to all other obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (OCRD)’s and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) but not to depression and drug alcohol craving. In this network, OCD was only linked to depression through other OCRD’s and GAD. Further, our results highlighted the importance of fatigue as it was one of the most central nodes in Network 2.","['obsessive-compulsive disorder', 'comorbidity', 'network analysis']"

In the present study we examined how drivers’ self-reported trust develops before having had experience (pre-test), immediately after having had experience (post-test), and five to seven days after having had experience (follow-up) with a Level 2 (Partial Automation) vehicle in a driving simulator. Additionally, we investigated the possibility for video procedure effect on self-reported trust. Results were against our expectations and showed that self-reported trust decreased after having had more experience with the Level 2 (Partial Automation) vehicle and different for each of the two videos. This study also investigated the role of sense of presence in a simulated driving experience. Analysis of the results and drivers’ feedback showed that generally low scores on sense of presence could be possibly explained for by the lack of involvement and predictability.",['Trust Automation Sense of Presence ADAS']

These facial expressions are created by activating a group of facial muscles. A group of muscles that perform an action together is also called an Action Unit (AU). Action Units can be described in a systematic way with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Six emotions are recognised as the universal basic emotions, which are found globally, in all cultures. OpenFace is a software program that uses algorithms to find AUs associated with these six basic emotions. So far, scientific research on emotional facial expressions has primarily used non-spontaneous, acted facial expressions. Less is known about spontaneous emotional facial expressions and the way OpenFace algorithmically evaluates them. The current study investigated the association between OpenFace evaluations and participants' evaluations of spontaneous emotional facial expressions. In addition, it also examines the influence of sleep quality on the recognition of emotions. A sample of 72 participants completed the study, in which they evaluated video segments containing spontaneous emotional facial expressions on the basis of the six universal basic emotions. They also rated their sleep quality and assessed the intensity, ambiguity and authenticity of the segments. Through correlation tests, an association was found between OpenFace evaluations and the participant evaluations. The results do not support a significant correlation between sleep quality and emotion recognition. Future research can build on this study by investigating AU-combinations of spontaneous emotional facial expressions other than the six basic emotions.","['Action Units, basic emotions, emotional facial expressions, Facial Action Coding System, OpenFace, sleep quality.']"

Jongere generaties komen weinig in de natuur omdat ze veel tijd achter hun beeldscherm spenderen, minder tijd hebben om naar buiten te gaan en hier minder geïnteresseerd in zijn dan de oudere generaties. Op basis hiervan is er in huidig onderzoek voorspeld dat de natuur een positiever effect heeft op de positieve en negatieve stemming van de oudere generatiegroep (die geboren is tussen 1946 en 1980) in vergelijking met de jongere generatiegroep (die geboren is tussen 1981 en 2003). Aan dit onderzoek deden 125 participanten mee die moesten kijken naar 12 natuurfoto’s gedurende 15 seconden per foto. Om de positieve en negatieve stemming te meten werd vooraf en achteraf van het zien van de natuurfoto’s de PANAS-X afgenomen. De hypotheses zijn getoetst door middel van de Mann-Whitney U toets. Uit de resultaten is geen significant verschil gebleken tussen de generatiegroepen in het effect dat de natuurfoto’s hebben op de positieve en negatieve stemming.

ENgage Young peOple earlY (ENYOY) The effect of an online transdiagnostic platform on emerging mental health problems among Dutch youths and the influence of high sensitivity – a mixed method approach,"Boeschoten, Cato","['van Doorn, M.', 'Molendijk, M.L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. More than 25% of Dutch youths is currently labeled as ‘psychologically unhealthy’ and access to care is often unavailable due to long waiting lists. In order to provide adequate care to young individuals before clinical transition occurs, the effects of an online and clinical- and peer-moderated platform, ‘ENgage YOung people earlY’ (ENYOY), on the improvement of youth mental health were examined. It was hypothesized that spending six months on ENYOY would have a significant impact on social and occupational functioning, psychological distress and positive health; that results would be significantly different for highly sensitive persons (HSPs) and that HSPs would report different platform experience compared to non-HSPs. Methods. This study adopted a mixed-methods approach. Based on a sample of 45 participants, three within-subjects repeated measures ANOVAs with three levels (point in time: baseline, three and six months) and high sensitivity as a between-subjects factor were conducted in order to analyze the effect of platform participation on psychological distress, positive health and functioning over time. Ten in-depth interviews were conducted and analyzed using open coding, in order to gain more insight on individual platform experience and differences between HSPs and non-HSPs. Results. Using ENYOY for six months had a significant effect on functioning, psychological distress and positive health. Significant effects for all points in time were found for functioning and significant effects for the first two time points were found for positive health and psychological distress. No significant interaction effect was found between HSP and the three variables over time. Qualitative analysis showed overall satisfaction with ENYOY as an online preventative tool for emerging mental health complaints based on areas of usability, user friendliness, usefulness, impact, inclusivity and connection with others. Moreover, useful suggestions for future implementation were given. Conclusion. The present study demonstrated that using ENYOY improves functioning, psychological distress and positive health among young individuals with emerging mental health problems over the course of six months and that ENYOY is experienced as a useful tool to treat subclinical psychological complaints. Considering limitations, future research might focus more on high sensitivity as a factor in clinical settings, as well as on the implementation of ENYOY as a fully automated platform.","['psychological distress, Highly Sensitive Persons, e-health, early detection and intervention, indicated prevention, mental health, positive health, social functioning, digital platform']"

Optimizing triage of treatment seeking patients with common mental disorders,"Haaster, Jeroen van","['Beurs, E. de']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Waiting time for treatment in Dutch mental healthcare is increasing. General practitioners substantially deviate from the allocation guideline which seems to contribute to the increase of waiting time. This study aimed to investigate whether undertreatment can be beneficial for patients and the MHC system. In addition, this study aimed to identify characteristics of undertreated patients that suffered unfavorable undertreatment based on clinical data and clinical judgement by general practitioners. Data was obtained in a naturalistic environment in a mental healthcare institution in the Netherlands and patients received treatment as usual. A total of 6193 electronic patient records were included. Exclusion criteria and missing data left 1057 cases eligible for analyses. A one-way ANOVA and a forward hierarchical binary logistic regression were conducted to investigate both aims. Results showed that undertreatment relates to worse treatment outcomes in comparison to patients in S-MHC. Unfavorable undertreatment was best predicted by waiting time and level of pre-treatment functioning. Longer waiting time is related to the need for more specialized care. Also, lower levels of pre-treatment functioning is related to the need for more specialized care. B-MHC care for undertreated patients must be improved. GPs seem to have valid reason to deviate from the allocation guideline. The allocation guideline could benefit from the addition of variables based on clinical judgement. To provide the care that undertreated patients need, treatment in B-MHC could be prolonged to match outcomes in S-MHC. Another solution could be to limit the negative effects during waiting time for patients.","['Mental Healthcare', 'Triage', 'Treatment outcome']"

To do that it has determined the European Council as the most influential body that can ensure collective action between the sovereign member states of the European Union. To assess how that is done the design principles of Elinor Ostrom (1992) are used as a measurement. Together with scapegoat theory, borrowed from social-psychology, the actions of the European Council are analysed in two cases. Where the first case, the EU-Turkey deal as a response to the refugee crisis of 2015, had successful collective action. The second case was less successful, as in the poisoning of Navalny a collective response failed. In both the cases there was the possibility to blame an equal scapegoat, however, the affected actors differed in their tangibility. The study shows that some of the design principles are easily discarded in the EU, which hampers the success of cooperation. Furthermore, it shows that a scapegoat can influence the working of Ostrom’s design principles, however, to increase the external validity of that a more diverse case study must be done.","['European Union', 'European Council', 'Ostrom design principles']"

A Study on the Influence of Subjective Numeracy on the Estimation of Side Effect Risks,"Drossaers, Sophie","['Willems, S.W.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Patient information leaflets (PILs) contain all known side effects that could occur in medicine use. The chances of side effect occurring are often noted in odds (‘1 in 10’), combined with a term (‘uncommon’). Previous studies show that many patients who have read the PIL tend to overestimate the chance of side effects happening in medicine use. This may lead to decreased treatment adherence and increased anxiety around medicine use. Additionally, in research when participants are asked to estimate chances of an event happening, a trend in participants to answer with “50%” is seen. Research objective: To investigate whether the overestimation of side effects in medicine use is related to subjective numeracy. An additional goal was to investigate whether there is a trend of participants estimating chances as “50%”. Methods: Subjective numeracy was measured using the Subjective Numeracy Scale (SNS). Participants were given patient information about a fictional medicine and its probability of several different side effects. After, they were asked a series of questions about the chance of specific side-effects happening in its use. Results: Little to no difference in health risk estimation was found between the high- or low numeracy groups. However, it is possible that this lack of the expected difference in outcome is caused by an imperfect study design and small, skewed study sample. No answers of “50%” were found. Conclusions: There was no evidence found in the current study to suggest subjective numeracy and health risk calculation are influenced by one another.","['side effects', 'patient information leaflet', 'medicine', 'subjective numeracy', 'side effect estimation']"

These physical and emotional challenges can affect their self-confidence and their friendship quality and can cause them a lot of stress. Another important challenge during adolescence is achieving success in academic achievement and it is therefore important to find out which factors can influence their learning performance. This research focused on the following research questions: What is the influence of stress on the learning performance? Does self-confidence mediate the effect of friendship quality on learning performance? A total of 119 students between the ages of 12 and 16 completed various online questionnaires, namely the ASQ, which measures the degree of stress; the FQS and the NRI, which measure friendship quality; the RSES, which measures self-confidence; a questionnaire about the grades for the subjects Dutch, English and Mathematics, which measures learning performance. A linear single regression analysis showed that stress has a significant negative effect on adolescents' learning performance. A mediation analysis showed that no significant mediation effect was found, i.e. self-confidence does not mediate the effect of friendship quality on learning performance. The significant negative effect of stress on learning performance may be relevant for developing stress reduction interventions to improve learning performance. The non-significant mediation effect could be due to the situational circumstances of the COVID-19 crisis. For a follow-up study it may be interesting to look at possible gender differences in the investigated variables.",
