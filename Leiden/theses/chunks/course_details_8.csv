Can Scarcity be Fruitful? Effects of Past and Present Scarcity on Cognition,"Üstün, Damla",['Dr. H.A.H. Ruigendijk'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Considering the many children around the world that live in financially scarce conditions, it is of importance to know the consequences with regard to cognition. Life history theory suggests people growing up in these scarce circumstances might develop different ways of adapting to this environment. This study looks at the influence of childhood financial scarcity on cognitive performance, when a current mindset of financial scarcity is activated. Specifically, this research is focused on determining performance on inhibition and cognitive switching tasks for people with different scarcity backgrounds and mindsets. In order to test this, people were questioned about their childhood. Then, half of the participants was instructed to recall a scarcity-related memory, while others recalled a neutral memory. Finally participants were presented with a cognitive task, which measured either inhibition or cognitive switching. It was expected that in a current scarcity mindset, people that had a scarcity background would perform lower on inhibition, but higher on switching. According to the results, neither childhood scarcity, current scarcity mindset, nor the combination of the two, were significant predictors of performance on the cognitive tasks. On these grounds, further research is needed to determine the relation between scarcity and cognition.","['scarcity', 'cognition', 'switching', 'inhibition', 'life history theory']"
"Many Loves: An anthropological exploration of the values and narratives of consensual non-monogamists on love, sex, and relationality","Legein, Mowgli","['Postma, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This article explores the multiplicity of experiences and perspectives of people practicing consensual non-monogamy (CNM) and questions how their values about love, intimacy, relationality, and sexuality relate to their practice of CNM. To gain these insights, I used experimental ethnographic methods such as autoethnography, film, and in-depth unstructured interviewing, alongside a theoretical framework based on Foucault’s view on sexuality and the concept of mononormativity combined with the wider contextualizing academic discussion surrounding CNM. This resulted in argumentation that centers around the idea that the discourse and narratives surrounding love sex and relationality one adheres to, relate not only to various practical approaches to CNM but also to one’s sense of identity and morality within it. First, I explored sexually nonexclusive relationships or open relationships, in the context of the youth hook-up culture, and then in married couples exploring swinging and BDSM non- monogamously. I argued that both of these relationships’ structures depended on a mononormative separation of romantic love and sexuality, while for the first group this separation was implicit and extradyadic sexuality went unspoken, the second group created this dissociation voluntarily and critically as they presented sex as a form of play and claimed to take advantage of the conventional structure of marriage. After this, I focused on polyamory i.e., romantic CNM, and its use of language to label feelings, relationships, and social phenomena to change the way polyamorists relate and communicate. Which impacted not only polyamorists’ philosophy of relationality but also causes a reorganization of their lives and their sense of identity. However, as this sanitized holistic vision of love is essentialized into a relational identity, it still carries underlying mononormative tendencies.",
De relatie tussen symptomen van de verschillende PTSS-clusters van moeders en hyperactiviteits- en aandachtsproblemen van hun jonge kinderen na huiselijk geweld,"Aarts, Eline","['Asdonk, S. van der']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"There is still a lot unknown about the impact of complex trauma on parents and their young children, especially after interparental violence. When this knowledge is expanded, interventions can be designed accordingly to treat the effects and prevent impact of trauma for future generations. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of different trauma-related symptoms of mothers on a specific domain of problems their young children might be facing after interparental violence. The main question was: ‘How are symptoms from the four different posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters of mothers related to the attention and hyperactivity symptoms of their children after experiencing interparental violence?’ To answer this question, surveys were issued to fourteen women victimized by interparental violence living in Dutch women’s shelters. They reported on their PTSD symptoms and the attention and hyperactivity symptoms of their youngest child, aged between one and six years old (M = 3 years and 6 months, SD = 1 year and 9 months). Social workers of most of the children also completed questionnaires on the attention and hyperactivity symptoms of the child. It was found that the PTSD symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal, as well as the overall severity of PTSD symptoms, were not significantly related to the attention and hyperactivity symptoms of the child. Small but unsignificant differences were found between the different PTSD symptom clusters. It is recommended to direct future research to the impact of the different trauma-related symptoms of parents after domestic violence on specific child outcomes. When these relations are understood more thoroughly, interventions can be deployed where help is needed most and intergenerational transmission of the effects of complex trauma will be challenged.","['PTSS, aandachts- en hyperactiviteitsproblemen, ADHD, huiselijk geweld, vrouwenopvang, trauma, complex trauma']"

This is done on the basis of two research questions: 1) What are the characteristics (genotype and phenotype) of the Angelman Syndrome and the Prader-Willi Syndrome? 2) Is it known from literature whether people with AS or PWS have an intensive need for care? Is a distinction noticeable between the group from the literature and the group of clients with AS, who all have an intensive care demand, in the SCORE research? Method: For the first research question, extensive literature research at meta level was performed. In addition, the literature has been analyzed on the basis of the domains of the AAIDD-model. A multiple case study was conducted for the second research question. Of the 225 clients, 2 were clients with AS and there were no clients with PWS. The results of the BSID-III, CI, VABS, DBC-A and the SMS have been analyzed. Results: People with AS have a profound intellectual disability. There is a severe disorder in every domain of the VABS. There is little to no participation in society. People with AS often have sleep disturbances, seizures, ataxia, and motor development delays. The living environment differs for each client. People with PWS have a mild intellectual disability with an average IQ between 60-70 but in addition also have severe medical and physical challenges. Conclusion: People with AS have an intensive need for care due to their low functioning level. More research is needed on the health care needs of people with PWS to conclude whether they have intensive care needs.","['Angelman Syndrome, Prader-Willi Syndrome, Intensive care, Characteristics, Intellectual disability']"

Federalism and Conditional Cash Transfer Programs,"Schalken, Dagmar","['Van Reuler, A. A. H. E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"While much research has been done on how conditional cash transfers (CCTs) affect development outcomes, little is known about the input-side of conditional cash transfers. What affects their design, development, and diffusion? Analysing conditional cash transfers in the federal countries of Brazil, India, and Ethiopia the purpose of this research has been to explore whether federal structures impact conditional cash transfers. The three mechanisms of credit-claiming, national emulation and lesson-drawing have been derived from the existing literature and applied to CCTs. Conducting theoretically guided case study analyses it was found that of the three theoretical expectations, only national emulation formed a pattern across the cases. However, the explorative design of this thesis allowed for other findings to emerge. Such as the discrepancy between CCT-designs and federalism as written down in the constitution. Also, it was found that IOs and NGOs contribute more to improving the quality of services under CCTs than changing the design of CCTs. This thesis has been a first step in the research on federalism and CCTs. Further research is highly recommended to include more cases, as well as some unitary cases and a re-conceptualization of CCT-reform.","['Federalism, Public Policy, Cash Transfer, Development, Global South']"

Investigating the Relationship between Covid Status and Depressive Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Focus on the Role of Extraversion,"Alladin, Yasmine","['João, A.M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Observed globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has generated a mental health decline. The pandemic has affected the general public, individuals that have been quarantined and individuals who have been infected with COVID-19. Currently, only a few available studies compare pandemic-onset depressive symptoms between these groups. Additionally, it is not yet known how a dominant position on the personality continuum of introversion/extraversion influences individuals’ experiences of depressive symptoms. Thus, the present study investigates differences between covid groups, as well as differences between individuals with dominant introverted versus extraverted traits. The findings will contribute to the construction of a global response in the observed mental health decline. The study is carried out through a cross-sectional online questionnaire (N = 150), in a group of adults between 18 and 30 years old. Individuals’ differences in positions on the introversion/extraversion continuum are measured using the HEXACO- PI-R. The mean PHQ-9 and HADS depression scores were observed to be 14.95/10.25 (healthy), 18.35/11.94 (quarantined), 15.64/10.25 (infected) and 15.76/11.55 (quarantined + infected) in the respective groups. No difference between covid status groups on the depression scores was found. Within the whole sample, in the healthy and quarantined + infected groups (p < 0.001), and in the PHQ-9 measured infected group (p = 0.045), significant negative relationships between extraversion and depressive symptom scores were found. These findings are limited due to small sample sizes, the cross-sectional design and the use of convenience sampling. Further studies should include larger sample sizes and make use of a longitudinal design and probability sampling.","['COVID-19', 'Covid status', 'depression', 'extraversion', 'personality']"

Does Novelty Promote Fear Extinction,"Koster, Jiska","['Schomaker, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent mental disorders. Treatment of these disorders, such as exposure-based treatment, is commonly derived from the principle of fear conditioning and fear extinction. In the current study the element of novelty was introduced into the process of extinction to explore how to promote fear extinction, as with standard extinction fear frequently returns over time. Extinction by means of novelty was studied in 32 human subjects using a within-subjects design. First, the participants underwent fear conditioning, in which conditioned stimuli (sounds) were paired with fearful images. This phase was directly followed by an extinction phase with a novelty-facilitated, familiar and standard extinction condition. After a time gap of a minimum of 12 to a maximum of 36 hours responses to the conditioned stimuli were tested again. Pupil size measurements and subjective arousal ratings during this post-extinction phase did not indicate an effect for novelty-facilitated extinction on the extent of fear, this may be the result of potential weak conditioning in the current study. The results of this study express the need for more research to understand the effect of novelty on fear extinction. This could contribute to future implementation of novelty in treatment of anxiety disorders.","['fear conditioning', 'fear extinction', 'novelty', 'pupil-size']"
Can Do vs. Have to? The impact of Gender and Social Mobility on Power Construal,"Ballering, David Marinus","['Scheepers, D.T.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social Power is the relative control over the outcome of oneself and others (Fiske & Berdahl, 2007). Power can be interpreted differently, which in turn can have a big impact on the power holders and on the ones who experience the expressed power (Keltner et. al., 2003). The literature distinguishes between power as opportunity and power as responsibility (De Wit et al., 2017). Moreover, stereo- typical gender differences especially affect women as they keep them from reaching leadership pos- itions (Tabassum & Nayak, 2021). However, not only gender affects behavior, also our socio-eco- nomic status can influences a life significantly. The change in socio-economic status is called social mobility (Reforms, 2010). A restricted social mobility seem to keep individuals from reaching lead- ership positions (Brown, 2013). Self-reports on power construal were collected with overall n= 227 respondents to find out about the possible differences in how men and women interpret power. The results show that self-identified females do interpret power more as responsibility than self-identi- fied males do. Both self-identified genders did not differ on construing power as opportunity. Fur- thermore, the study showed that social mobility has no effect on how power is interpreted. Never- theless, the current SES of an individual seems to have a small effect on how power is perceived. The current study highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between gender, so- cial mobility, and power construal and the necessity for further research.","['Power', 'Gender', 'Power construal', 'Opportunity', 'Responsibility', 'Social mobility', 'SES']"
Direct Anger and Averted Fear: Investigating Attentional Bias in a Dot-Probe Task,"Kap, Yasemin","['Zijlstra, T.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Emotions and emotional expressions are an integral part of human society. This study aims to add to our knowledge concerning whether people have an attentional bias toward a face expressing an emotion, depending on the gaze direction of the face. The saliency of emotional expressions has previously been researched. However, the dot-probe task has so far not been used to investigate whether people have an attentional bias toward a certain emotion depending on its gaze direction. We used the dot-probe task to measure an attentional bias between (1) angry faces with direct gazes and angry faces with averted gazes and (2) fearful faces with direct gazes and fearful faces with averted gazes. We hypothesized that (1) people have an attentional bias toward angry faces with a direct gaze when compared to angry faces with an averted gaze and (2) people have an attentional bias toward fearful faces with an averted gaze when compared to fearful faces with a direct gaze. Our study did not yield significant results. However, age was found to be a significant factor and a major limitation of our study was a narrow age range with only 7 participants over the age of 30. We conclude with describing the limitations of our study and providing recommendations for future studies.","['dot-probe, attentional bias, emotion, gaze direction']"

Coping mechanism and anxiety in university students with autism and healthy controls,"Popov, Nikolay Nikolov",['Willem Van der Does'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, society has witnessed a variety of changes which have forced individuals to find more ways for coping with increasing difficulties (such as social distancing, self-isolation, and lack of physical contact). For people with autism, the negative impact may be greater due to an interaction between the traits associated with the disorder and the environmental changes. Aim: To investigate anxiety in university students with autism and healthy students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, to explore the coping mechanisms of these two groups of students. Methods: Participants completed self-report online questionnaires for autism diagnosis, autism symptoms, primary coping style and anxiety. Results: Both an autism diagnosis and the type of the primary coping style were associated with anxiety. A post-hoc analysis showed that anxiety is statically greater in people who use avoidant coping style. Finally, students with autism spectrum disorder end to primarily use a maladaptive coping style. Limitations: The study is using self-report scales via online questionnaires therefore the data has the tendency to be more biased. Another limitation is regarding the focus group since the presence of autism is known to cause disruption in the understanding of the self as well as social relationships. This raises the question whether the subjects in the ASD group can adequately asses their anxiety levels and the ability to cope with stress. Conclusion: The present study provides further evidence that ASD individuals tend to be more anxious and tend to use more maladaptive coping strategies in order to deal with this anxiety compared to their peers. Results from the current research support the hypothesis that having an autism spectrum disorder predicts usage of avoidant coping strategies as a primary coping style.","['autism, coping mechanism, anxiety, COVID-19']"
De relatie tussen intelligentie en psychopathie bij jongeren met een normoverschrijdend-gedragsstoornis.,"Brabander, Manoe","['Aghajani, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Much research has been carried out on psychopathy. Psychopathy is a personality trait characterized by impulsive, insensible, and irresponsible behavior. Psychopathy is related to criminal behavior and recidivism of criminality. Psychopathy resembles but is not equal to Conduct Disorder. Conduct Disorder is a psychiatric disorder of childhood/adolescence characterized by continuous antisocial behaviors (i.e., stealing/aggression/vandalism). Another often researched construct is intelligence. Intelligence is the ability to learn new things and to use your knowledge in different situations. Intelligence is a possible protective factor in preventing criminality. In the current study, we investigated if intelligence is related to psychopathy and if this relation differs between people with versus people without a Conduct Disorder. Participants filled in the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia and the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory and completed an intelligence test. Results showed no significant effect of intelligence on psychopathy or Conduct Disorder. These results suggest that intelligence doesn’t play a major role in the constellation of psychopathic and/or Conduct-Disordered behaviors.",

De relatie tussen demografische en psychologische kenmerken van professionals en uithuisplaatsingsbeslissingen,"Imming, Nina",['De Haan W.D.'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"In 2020, 34.265 Dutch children were placed out of home. The out of home placement decision is important and difficult and has a big impact on children, parents and society. The decision is complicated because many factors have to be included. Furthermore, in most cases it is hard to predict the outcomes of the decision. Although this decision is so important, previous research showed that professionals differ in the decisions they make and that training in this area is not effective and not well studied. Likewise, research focusing on personal factors of the professional and their out of home placement decision is very limited. Therefore this study examined the relationship between psychological and demographic factors of the professionals and their out of home placement decisions. In this study data was used of the study from de Haan and colleagues (2019). The sample included 127 participants (child welfare professionals, children’s court judges, and master students of Education Child Studies and Child Law). Participants were asked to make a decision using vignettes based on child protection cases. Questionnaires were used to measure the demographic and psychological factors. The demographic factors gender and age, and the psychological factors mindset (towards change in behavior) and attitude (regarding out of home placements) were related to out of home placement decisions. Education level and the interaction term of attitude and age was not significantly related to out of home placement decisions. Lastly, the interaction term of mindset and age was significant; meaning that the relation between mindset and out of home placement decisions is stronger for older professionals. These results can contribute to awareness and training of professionals which will lead to more accurate out of home placement decisions and better circumstances for children.",

Om deze mensen toch een kans te bieden, wordt door GGZ Breburg een nieuw behandelprogramma opgezet. Het doel van dit onderzoek was het uitbrengen van een advies aan GGZ Breburg over werkzame en niet werkzame elementen in de huidige behandelingen van persoonlijkheidsstoornissen en gehechtheidstrauma. Er werden semigestructureerde diepte-interviews afgenomen bij vijf GGZ-therapeuten die ervaring hadden met de doelgroep. De interviews zijn getranscribeerd en gecodeerd met behulp van het programma Atlas.ti 22. Werkzame elementen waren volgens de therapeuten het maken van goed contact, de bereidheid van een cliënt om te werken aan zijn herstel (commitment ) en het opbouwen van vertrouwen. Volgens de therapeuten was een niet werkzaam element het geven van een te grote hoeveelheid psycho-educatie aan het begin van een behandeling. Een ander niet werkzaam element was als jongeren uit dezelfde behandelgroep op elkaar gingen steunen of als het vertrouwen beschadigd werd. Op basis hiervan werd aan GGZ Breburg geadviseerd extra aandacht te besteden aan het contact maken, commitment en het opbouwen van een vertrouwensrelatie. Daarnaast is geadviseerd om psycho-educatie in een beperkte mate aan te bieden aan het begin van een behandeling. Een beperking van het huidige onderzoek was de gelimiteerde steekproef. In vervolgonderzoek kan gekeken worden naar een onderzoek met een grotere steekproef dat zich richt op het doseren van psycho-educatie in de behandeling en het effect van MBT op cliënten die normaliter worden uitgesloten vanwege ASS-kenmerken.","['persoonlijkheidsstoornis', 'gehechtheidstrauma', 'borderline', 'trauma', 'ggz', 'complexe problematiek', 'jongeren']"

Guda'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Binnen veel instellingen worden mensen met meerdere psychische stoornissen uitgesloten voor deelname aan behandeling wegens de complexiteit van hun problematiek. Om deze mensen toch een kans te bieden, wordt door GGZ Breburg een nieuw behandelprogramma opgezet. Het doel van dit onderzoek was het uitbrengen van een advies aan GGZ Breburg over werkzame en niet werkzame elementen in de huidige behandelingen van persoonlijkheidsstoornissen en gehechtheidstrauma. Er werden semigestructureerde diepte-interviews afgenomen bij vijf GGZ-therapeuten die ervaring hadden met de doelgroep. De interviews zijn getranscribeerd en gecodeerd met behulp van het programma Atlas.ti 22. Werkzame elementen waren volgens de therapeuten het maken van goed contact, de bereidheid van een cliënt om te werken aan zijn herstel (commitment ) en het opbouwen van vertrouwen. Volgens de therapeuten was een niet werkzaam element het geven van een te grote hoeveelheid psycho-educatie aan het begin van een behandeling. Een ander niet werkzaam element was als jongeren uit dezelfde behandelgroep op elkaar gingen steunen of als het vertrouwen beschadigd werd. Op basis hiervan werd aan GGZ Breburg geadviseerd extra aandacht te besteden aan het contact maken, commitment en het opbouwen van een vertrouwensrelatie. Daarnaast is geadviseerd om psycho-educatie in een beperkte mate aan te bieden aan het begin van een behandeling. Een beperking van het huidige onderzoek was de gelimiteerde steekproef. In vervolgonderzoek kan gekeken worden naar een onderzoek met een grotere steekproef dat zich richt op het doseren van psycho-educatie in de behandeling en het effect van MBT op cliënten die normaliter worden uitgesloten vanwege ASS-kenmerken.",
Dynamisch testen bij hoogbegaafde kinderen en de relatie met faalangst en IQ-hoogte,"Dam, Jesse van","['Veerbeek, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Dynamic testing has the potential of unveiling information about instructional needs, learning processes and cognitive abilities. The aim of this study was to investigate the learning potential of gifted children on analogical reasoning tasks, using a computerized dynamic test. The participants were 80 children (mean age = 7.65), who were divided in an experimental condition (n = 41) and a control condition (n = 39), based on randomized blocking. The study consisted of a pre-test and a post-test. In between, the experimental group received two training sessions by following the graduated prompts method, while the control group received two practice moments. The results of this study showed a larger progress from pre- to post-test on analogical reasoning tasks for the experimental group compared to the control group. Therefore, computerised dynamic testing, when using the graduated prompts training, can be seen as a useful method to unveil the learning potential of young gifted children. Furthermore, the study focused on the relationship between dynamic testing and level of test anxiety (low, medium, high) and level of IQ (low, medium, high). As part of that, the instructional needs of these groups during training has been examined. Results did not show a relationship between dynamic testing and test anxiety at all. However, dynamic testing and level of IQ were related. Though the three groups of IQ made the same amount of progress from pre- to post-test, the group with lower IQ scored significant lower during both tests. No differences in instructional needs were found for either levels of test anxiety as well as levels of IQ.","['dynamisch testen', 'leerpotentieel', 'instructie-behoeften', 'hoogbegaafdheid', 'analogisch redeneren', 'computerized dynamic testing', 'graduated prompts', 'faalangst', 'IQ', 'intelligentie']"
Opmerkingen in de Rapporten van Jongens en Meisjes in Groep 8 van de Basisschool,"Linden, Anna van der",['dr. Marleen Groeneveld'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"All children need feedback from their teachers on their learning process to enlarge a growth mindset and intrinsic motivation. In this study the content of written texts of teachers on the school reports of children in the final grade of primary school are studied and the content of the texts is related to the children’s gender and their cognitive achievements, represented by the scores on their final tests. The reports and test scores are obtained from a longitudinal study at Leiden University. The total amount of words on the reports were counted and the text split up in units. These units were coded for positive and negative values and whether they tell something about the child or not (inclusive/exclusive). Quantitative methods are used to test the (cor)relations between the amount of words or character of the units and gender or final test scores. A qualitative analysis of a sample from the study is used to study the content of the texts in detail. There is a significant negative correlation between the amount of words on the report and the final test scores of children, but no correlation between the final test scores and the character of the units. No relations were found between gender of the child and the amount of words or the character of the unit. The quality of texts for high achieving children is positive, but poor because it contains no advise and little feedback that enhances their learning process or increases their growth mentality. The conclusion is that the texts of teachers on school reports, especially of high achieving children, contribute little to the growth mindset and intrinsic motivation of the child. The study might be restricted because the sample did not reflect the total population. This could be solved with an extension of the sample. The results of the qualitative analysis of 12 reports is promising and gives reason to examine the entire sample in this way.","[': Growth mindset', 'Feedback', 'Intrinsic motivation', 'School reports']"

With this urgency, there is growing momentum behind youth movements advocating for serious action, and they have specific demands. This study aims to provide a descriptive analysis of the representation of social movements, precisely the Fridays for Future movement, in the political arena. This study asks, ‘What determines the political narratives of politicians representing European countries in COP25?’ To explore this question, this thesis uses qualitative methods to analyze three important connections: 1) the recognition that the demands of FFF get at the level of European politicians at the COP25, 2) the direct references made by European politicians with various political positions, 3) the usage of business-related narrative in COP25 by politicians with different political positions. Speeches given by 22 European countries at the COP25 summit are analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results provide deeper insight mostly in favor of the expectations that FFF and their demands got reflected in the narratives of European politicians at COP25. Additionally, a politician's political orientation showed mixed results regarding whether they incorporate business-related narratives in their speeches.",

"Social identity, trust and clientelism: Quantitative research on the impact of social identity on clientelism in African countries","Reedijk, Koen",['Dr L. Demarest'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Clientelism has been extensively studied in different social structures in Africa. However, without monitoring it is not clear why individuals in some social contexts are more susceptible to clientelism than others. Using the Social Identity Approach from social psychology, I suggest strong social identities like ethnicity and party identification can explain why clientelism is more prevalent in some countries than others. I will use the following research question: ‘How does social identity impact clientelism?’ I will analyse the impact of social identity on clientelism with mass survey data of the Afrobarometer Round 6 (2016) from 25 different African countries. This relationship will be tested through multilevel logistic regression analysis at both the individual level and country level. I find that ethnic identity, party identification and social norms increase the likeliness of an individual to engage in clientelism. This suggests that social identity plays a role in facilitating clientelism. However, which social identity is relevant varies across countries and in different social contexts. This implies that to understand why and how voters engage in clientelism with brokers and patrons that social identity should be taken into account. Furthermore, how policies and political choices shape identity is important because the impact of social identity on clientelism is dependent on the social context.","['clientelism, social identity, Africa']"
How do consumers make sense of online reviews: Impact of emotions in electronic word of mouth settings,"BASAR, BERKE",['Mirre Stallen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous research on emotions in electronic word-of-mouth settings revealed that anger reduces the informative value of the review, but what happens when previously written reviews, or ""reviewer history,"" are accessible to observers? The current study investigates whether angry reviews always reduce the informative value of reviews or whether there are exceptions to previous findings. To test our hypothesis, participants on Prolific Web Services (N=179) were provided with an initial review written by a hypothetical reviewer who is angry at a hotel. This initial angry target review was the same review across all conditions. They were then randomly distributed to four distinct review history conditions created by the same reviewer: consistent anger (six angry reviews), consistent happy (six happy reviews), mixed emotions (three angry and three happy reviews), and control condition (no reviewer history). We asked them to rate the initial target reviews’ informative value, degree of reviewers’ rationality, and participants’ intention to visit the hotel mentioned in the target review. Our results indicated that angry review history decreased the informative value of the initial target review and decreased the perceived rationality of the reviewer compared to happy, mixed, and control conditions. On the other hand, happy review history increased the informative value of the review and the perceived rationality of the reviewer compared to angry, mixed, and control conditions. For mixed emotions, informative value and perceived rationality ratings fell right between angry and happy conditions as expected. Finally, we discussed the finding’s theoretical and practical implications in the literature and in the digitalized world.","['EWOM, emotions, hotel reviews, informational value, percieved rationality']"
Adviesrapport Leren in je Wijk: Een onderzoek naar het sociaal-emotioneel welzijn van kinderen binnen het project leren in je wijk en hoe dit concept mogelijk in kaart gebracht en bevorderd kan worden,"Zhu, Yiyan",['R.A.G. Emmen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit adviesrapport is geschreven in opdracht van Samen Ondernemend Leren (SOL) voor het project ‘Leren in je Wijk’ (LijW). Het project heeft als doel kinderen tussen de 10 en 14 jaar oud te begeleiden in huiswerk en hen leerstrategieën aan te leren (Samen Ondernemend Leren, 2022). Het doel van ons onderzoek is een advies uitbrengen over hoe het sociaalemotioneel welzijn in kaart gebracht en bevorderd kan worden tijdens het project LijW. De hoofdvraag van het onderzoek luidde als volgt: ‘Welke vaardigheden en instrumenten kunnen worden toegepast door begeleiders van LijW om het sociaal-emotioneel welzijn van kinderen van 10 tot en met 14 jaar binnen de vijf wijken in Leiden in kaart te brengen en te bevorderen?’ Om deze vraag te beantwoorden is er een kwalitatief onderzoek verricht, waarvoor interviews zijn afgenomen bij de begeleiders van LijW. De data die verzameld zijn, zijn verwerkt in het programma Atlas. Daarnaast is er gebruik gemaakt van een literatuurstudie om te onderzoeken welke vaardigheden en instrumenten bestaan om het sociaal-emotioneel welzijn van kinderen van 10 tot en met 14 jaar te bevorderen. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat de begeleiders geen tot nauwelijks gebruik maken van instrumenten en vaardigheden om het sociaal-emotioneel welzijn van de kinderen in kaart te brengen en te bevorderen. Verder is gebleken uit de wetenschappelijke literatuur dat er verschillende instrumenten zoals vragenlijsten, interventies en vaardigheden beschikbaar zijn om het sociaal-emotioneel welzijn te bevorderen. Naar aanleiding van de resultaten hebben wij drie adviezen gevormd voor LijW om het sociaal-emotioneel welzijn van de kinderen in kaart te brengen en te bevorderen. Het eerste advies is om een vragenlijst te implementeren om het sociaal-emotioneel welzijn in kaart te brengen. Een vragenlijst die hier mogelijk geschikt voor is, is de Kidscreen-27. Deze vragenlijst heeft als doelgroep 8 tot 18-jarige kinderen en poogt de kwaliteit van leven in kaart te brengen. De vragenlijst kan op meerdere momenten afgenomen worden om op de hoogte te blijven van de ontwikkeling van het sociaal-emotioneel welzijn van de kinderen. Het tweede advies is om een interventie toe te passen om het sociaal-emotioneel welzijn te bevorderen. Een interventie die hiervoor geschikt is, is het Rots en Water programma. Rots en Water is een weerbaarheids- en sociale vaardigheidstraining met een fysieke invalshoek met als doelgroep kinderen van 9-18 jaar. De training focust zich op het verhogen van de weerbaarheid en het ontwikkelen en verbeteren van sociale communicatieve vaardigheden en kan preventief worden toegepast. Het derde advies is om vaardigheden aan te leren of al bestaande vaardigheden van de begeleiders te verbeteren om het sociaal-emotioneel welzijn van kinderen in kaart te brengen en te bevorderen. De CARES-vaardigheden zijn hier geschikt voor. De vaardigheden zijn collaboratief, adaptief/flexibel/veerkrachtig, relatie-gericht, empathisch en (S)zelfregulerend. Deze competenties helpen de begeleiders om de kinderen te kunnen begeleiden in hun ontwikkeling van sociale en emotionele competenties.","['Sociaal-emotioneel welzijn', 'basisschool', 'middelbareschool']"

Buts en Bofn is ontwikkeld met als doel lastige onderwerpen bespreekbaar te maken. De methode bestaat uit gekleurde houten blokjes waarmee persoontjes kunnen worden opgebouwd. Het gebruik van deze verschillende kleuren kan iemand helpen om zijn of haar emoties uit te drukken. Een onderdeel van de methode is een legendakaart. Dit is een werkblad dat de therapeut voor de therapiesessie kan invullen met de cliënt. Op die manier kunnen er afspraken worden gemaakt over welke emotie aan welke kleur wordt toegekend door de cliënt en kan de therapeut de cliënt beter begrijpen. De legendakaart die Buts en Bofn gebruikt, is gebaseerd op het idee dat mensen kleur-emotieassociaties maken. Om te onderzoeken hoe de legendakaart het beste geïmplementeerd kan worden, is er onderzocht in hoeverre kleur-emotieassociaties van basisschoolleerlingen vanaf 7 jaar bij het herkennen van emoties van anderen betrouwbaar zijn.

"Principal-Agent Theory and the Implications for the United States, Russia, and the OPCW’s Work on Chemical Weapons in Syria.","Mantakas, Ioannis",['Janina Heaphy'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"While the OPCW has worked successfully since 1997 to end chemical warfare, this is not the case when looking at Syria. The organization made efforts like disarming the country from chemicals, but when this step fell short, the organization was unable to thoroughly analyze and make decisions about the attacks that followed. Although it had the resources to find more information and take actions like recommending collective measures or sanctioning Syria with the help of the UN, the OPCW still failed. It is alleged that some works of the OPCW were perceived as a threat to the national interests of Russia and the United States. As a result, these countries attempted to control the OPCW, which led to this failure. To prove this, this thesis answers the following research question: How did the United States and Russia attempt to control the OPCW’s work on the Syrian case from 2013 to 2021 to safeguard their national interest? To analyze this question, this thesis uses the Principal-Agent theory in the context of directed content analysis. In this way, this thesis aims to contribute to academia by unraveling how the idea of controlling an international organization is applied in this case study.","['Syrian Civil war', 'Chemical Weapons', 'Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)', 'United Nations, Russian intervention', 'American involvement, National interest', 'Realism', 'Principal-Agent theory.']"

The influence of Emotional Expressions in word-of mouth: The impact of reviewer history on the perception of anger expressed in online reviews,"Schade, Maya",['Gert-Jan Lelieveld'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Emotional expressions in online reviews affect reviews’ informative value. The current study examines how reviewer history impacts the effects of angry expressions on the informative value of a review. The current research demonstrates how different reviewer histories (consistently happy, consistently angry and mixed) differentially impact the perceived rationality of the reviewer and subsequently the informative value of an angry review made by the same reviewer. In an online experiment (N = 173) on Prolific Academic involving native English speakers, participants read an online hotel review expressing the emotion anger, followed by either a consistent happy reviewer history, a consistent angry reviewer history, a mixed angry and happy reviewer history, or no reviewer history. Results showed that an angry review that was followed by a consistently angry reviewer history led readers to judge the reviewer as more irrational, it decreased the informative value of the review, and led to stronger intentions to visit the hotel compared to an angry review followed by a consistently happy reviewer history, mixed reviewer history or no reviewer history. We found no differences in perceived rationality of the reviewer or informative value of angry reviews between the mixed reviewer history, consistent happy reviewer history, or no reviewer history conditions. Participants who read an angry target review and were not shown any reviewer history were also more likely to visit the hotel than participants who read the angry target review followed by a happy reviewer history. Our findings underscore the importance of studying the effects of reviewer history in online reviews.","['Emotions', 'Online Reviews', 'Anger expression', 'reviewer history']"
"Parental Empathic Accuracy Related to Autonomy Support: An Investigation of the Relationship Between Parental Empathic Accuracy and Autonomy Support Towards their Adolescent Child, and the Moderating Influence of the Parent-Child Bond","Fonteine, Klazina Gonea Maria",['Wilma Wentholt'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relation between parental empathic accuracy (positive and negative emotions) and parental autonomy support towards adolescent children in the context of a problem-solving task. In addition, the parent-child bond was researched to determine whether it could have a positive moderating effect on the previously mentioned relation. The present study used data from the healthy control group of the RE-PAIR study, which consisted of 77 adolescents (50 female, 27 male), between the age of 12-17 years old and their 134 parent(s) (73 female, 61 male), between the age of 33-62 years old. Results revealed that parental empathic accuracy of positive or negative emotions is not related to higher levels of observed parental autonomy support. In addition, the moderator analyses have shown that a stronger parent/child-reported bond does not influence this relation. However, an interesting explorative finding was that parents who can infer their children’s emotions can recognize positive and negative emotions. In addition, parents and their children have the same view on their emotional relationship. Furthermore, the present study found that children who are more satisfied with the relationship with their parents, have parents who infer their positive emotions more accurately. Lastly, the study found some exploratory results about the individual perspective that influences the relationship satisfaction. Given these points, we can conclude that parents’ ability to infer their children’s emotions accurately is no indicator of displaying parental autonomy support. The implications of the insignificant study results are discussed in detail.","['Parental empathic accuracy, autonomy support, parent-child bond, adolescents']"
De visie van pedagogisch medewerkers van kinderopvangorganisatie Kibeo op genderneutraal opvoeden,"Jongenotter, Carolien","['Groeneveld, M. G.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Genderneutraal opvoeden komt steeds meer voor in onze maatschappij. In dit onderzoek is bekeken wat er in de literatuur bekend is over genderneutraal opvoeden. Daarnaast is onderzocht wat de visie van de pedagogisch medewerkers van kinderopvangorganisatie Kibeo over genderneutraal opvoeden is. Uit het literatuuronderzoek bleek dat de kinderopvang invloed heeft op de ontwikkeling van kinderen. De eerste levensjaren van een kind vormen een belangrijke basis voor de ontwikkeling, zo ook voor de ontwikkeling van genderidentiteit. Het is gebleken dat pedagogisch medewerkers van invloed zijn op de (gender)ontwikkeling van een kind. Het zou dus mogelijk kunnen zijn dat de invloed van de kinderopvang eveneens van invloed is op de ontwikkeling van genderidentiteit. Naast dit literatuuronderzoek is een kwalitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd. Dit is gedaan door interviews uit te voeren naar de visie van pedagogisch medewerkers. Deze respondenten hebben zich aangemeld via een oproep die is gedaan door een beleidsmedewerker van Kibeo namens de onderzoekers. De respondenten waren vrouwelijke pedagogisch medewerkers die op de groepen werkten met kinderen van nul tot vier jaar oud. Er zijn tien semigestructureerde diepte-interviews afgenomen, die gehouden zijn aan de hand van een vooraf geschreven topic guide. Dit werd gebruikt als rode draad in de interviews, maar hier werd van afgeweken als het interview daarom vroeg. Na het transcriberen van de interviews zijn deze in het computerprogramma Atlas.ti gecodeerd. De belangrijkste codes die aan tekstfragmenten zijn gekoppeld, zijn codes voor de visies van de pedagogisch medewerkers, de gender contrastereotyperende opmerkingen die werden gedaan en de sturing van de respondenten. Na het coderen zijn de interviews aan de hand van deze codes geanalyseerd. Uit de analyse bleek dat het grootste deel van de pedagogisch medewerkers een positieve houding heeft ten opzichte van genderneutraal opvoeden. Door het merendeel van de medewerkers werd het geaccepteerd als er door kinderen met elk soort speelgoed gespeeld werd, ongeacht hun gender. Een belangrijke overeenkomst hierin was de autonomie van het kind. Er waren ook twee negatieve meningen ten opzichte van genderneutraal opvoeden, waarin werd aangegeven dat er een grens zat aan genderneutraal opvoeden en waarin werd afgevraagd of het wel mogelijk zou zijn. Ook door deze medewerkers werd echter het spelen met verschillende soorten speelgoed ongeacht gender geaccepteerd. Naast tekstfragmenten over de visie van de pedagogisch medewerkers over genderneutraal opvoeden zijn er tekstfragmenten bekeken over de sturing van de pedagogisch medewerkers en de omgang met de ouders van de kinderen. Hieruit is gebleken dat de meeste respondenten kinderen aansporen om met allerlei soorten speelgoed te spelen en dat dit vaak in het belang is van de ontwikkeling van de kinderen. Zo laten de respondenten zien dat ze inderdaad voor het belang en de autonomie van het kind kiezen. Aan de omgang met de ouders kan worden gezien dat een deel van de pedagogisch medewerkers de wensen van de ouders voorop stelt en een deel de autonomie van het kind. Door dit onderzoek is er een begin van een algemene visie van de pedagogisch medewerkers van Kibeo in kaart gebracht, maar dit is nog niet bruikbaar voor een beleid voor genderneutraal opvoeden binnen de kinderopvangorganisatie Kibeo. Het advies is om voor dit eventuele beleid in gesprek te gaan met de pedagogisch medewerkers en om nog meer onderzoek te doen naar genderneutraal opvoeden.","['Genderneutraal, opvoeden, kinderen, kinderopvang, pedagogisch medewerkers']"
Perceived stress in young people after experiences of childhood maltreatment: The protective effect of self-esteem.,"Gaalen, Axelle van","['Scheuplein, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous research has shown that experiences of childhood maltreatment (CM) are related to higher levels of perceived stress in everyday life. The negative consequences of CM often increase with the number and severity of CM experiences, which can lead to the development of stress-related problems from an early age. However, individuals may perceive situations as less stressful when they possess higher self-esteem. Therefore, the current study investigates whether the relationship between CM severity and perceived stress can be influenced by self-esteem in a population of young people. The sample consisted of 62 participants between 16 and 26 years of age (M = 22.45, SD = 2.67) from the Resilience After Individual Stress Exposure (RAISE) study. Data were collected using three self-report questionnaires: (1) the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, (2) the Perceived Stress Scale-10, and (3) the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed to analyse the data. The first finding indicated that the level of perceived stress did not change significantly as the CM experiences were more severe. There was, however, a significant relationship between the level of self-esteem and the level of perceived stress, with the level of perceived stress decreasing as self-esteem increased. Finally, it was found that self-esteem did not influence the relationship between the severity of CM and the level of perceived stress. Collectively, these findings indicate that higher self-esteem is related to lower perceived stress in young people, but the severity of CM is not of influence. This supports that it may be beneficial for young people to focus treatment on increasing self-esteem, despite experiences of CM. To provide more targeted treatment, it would be relevant to focus future research on the different types of CM and the skills and resources that shape the level of perceived stress.","['Childhood maltreatment', 'perceived stress', 'self-esteem', 'young people']"

Oudega MPhil'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Since 2014 more students with behaviour problems are reported in mainstream education and dealing with these students is considered more challenging. Not dealing properly with these challenges can lead to developmental problems in children and safety problems in class. The instrument of the plan of developmental perspective (OPP) is used to determine the support they need. The way teachers experience the student-teacher relationship and their self-efficacy in the classroom can affect the development of students in different aspects, their own behaviour towards students and student behaviour. In the current study, 41 teachers were asked to fill in a plan for developmental perspective and two questionnaires for two students they consider challenging. The questionnaires concern the way the teachers experience the student-teacher relationship and their self-efficacy in the classroom. This research focuses on the relation between the experience of the student-teacher relationship and of the self-efficacy by the teacher and the way the teacher describes the student in the plan of developmental perspective, no significant results were found. Furthermore, there was no mediation effect found from the student-teacher relationship on the relation between self-efficacy and the description of the student in the plan of developmental perspective. It is recommended to do further research, with a random sample with a broader target group from different regions and different schools with children that show difficult behaviour and children that show pro-social behaviour. Furthermore, it is important to make sure teachers have similar understanding of the way they report in the plan of developmental perspective and that a better method is developed to objectivise the data coming from the plan of developmental perspective and the questionnaires.","['beeldvorming leerkrachten, leerlingen met probleemgedrag, leerling-leerkrachtrelatie, overtuiging over eigen kunnen leerkracht']"
Impact of Parental Divorce on Adolescent Internalizing and Externalizing Problems,"Tundjay, İpek","['Sieh, D.S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present study examined three different groups of adolescents (no divorce, divorce, and peri-divorce) in a cross-sectional study of Dutch adolescents (N = 14,197). Adolescents aged 12- 18 completed self-report questionnaires on divorce, adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems, adolescent stress, and quality of relationship with parents. We examined whether the relationship between divorce and adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems were strengthened through factors of adolescent stress and quality of relationship with parents. Multiple mediation analyses with PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2015) controlled for age and sex. Our findings revealed that adolescent stress and relationship quality with parents fully mediated the relationship between divorce and internalizing problems. However, it partially mediated the relationship between divorce and externalizing problems. The results highlighted the importance of addressing adolescent stress on developing internalizing problems among adolescents who experienced divorce. Facilitating high quality of relationship with parents and decreasing adolescent stress may act as a buffer against developing internalizing and externalizing problems. Longitudinal research should consider the complexity of the composition of divorced families.",
Conflicting Interests: A Single Case Study on the Blocking of a Common Statement of the European Union by Greece,"Scheer, Ruben van der","['Pomorska, K.M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"What theories explain the position of Greece on the common statement for human rights at the UN? This is the research question that this thesis is going to answer. The relevance of the subject of cohesiveness can be found in the stability that it provides. It is also argued that that internal cohesiveness can lead to a better external effectiveness. Therefore, this thesis will examine the reasons as to why Greece decided to not agree with the common statement that was to be made at the United Nations. For this to be examined, this thesis will offer and explain multiple theories. Those theories can give a possible explanation for the action of Greece. Then, this thesis will explain the case of Greece and also cover the recent history of the relations between China and Greece to find possible motives. This thesis finds mostly economic motives on behalf of Greece, and geopolitical motives for China, and can therefore link those motives to the theories of realism, rational choice theory and liberal theory. The thesis concludes by arguing that the discovered motives of Greece and China can be explained with the offered theories.","['European Union, Greece, China, common statement, blocking']"
"Het verband tussen sociale cognitie, agressie en psychopathie bij mannelijke jeugddelinquenten met een normoverschrijdend-gedragsstoornis (CD)","Heenes, Valerie","['Aghajani, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"There is currently little scientific research on male juvenile offenders with Conduct Disorder (CD), while 73% of male juvenile offenders have this disorder. In addition, many adolescents with CD receive no treatment or the incorrect treatment, while demonstrating high levels of aggression and psychopathic traits. People with CD show abnormalities in brain areas responsible for social cognition. The question is whether the neurocognitive abnormalities for social cognition is the cause of symptomatic behaviors such as aggression and psychopathic traits. This study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between social cognition, aggression and psychopathy in male juvenile delinquents with CD. The sample consisted of 52 male juvenile delinquents with CD (M = 16.94 years; SD = 1.36 years; range = 15 - 19 years). The mean IQ was 95.92 (SD = 6.45). In addition, the mean socioeconomic status (SES) of the participants was -0.83 (SD = 1.80; range = -5.24 - 2.77). The following questionnaires were used: Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Reactive Proactive Questionnaire (RPQ) and the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory (YPI). Results showed that impairments in social cognition was a significant predictor of both reactive aggression and total aggression score. No significant association was found between impairments in social cognition and proactive aggression and psychopathy. The current research contributes to the knowledge of the treatment of male juvenile delinquents with CD. More scientific research is needed to confirm the results of this study.","['Conduct Disorder', 'male juvenile offenders', 'social cognition', 'aggression', 'psychopathy']"

A first multiple regression analysis showed that affinity with the organization related positively and directly to likeability of the organization, but moral identity as a control variable didn’t relate to the likeability of the organization. A second multiple regression analysis showed that moral identity and affinity with the organization related directly and positively to empathy. A mediation analysis showed that affinity with the organization related indirectly and positively to willingness to donate money to the nonprofit organization through likeability of the organization. Another mediation analysis showed that moral identity didn’t relate to willingness to donate money to the nonprofit organization through empathy.

"A meta-analysis on the relationship between green space, socioeconomic status, and hair cortisol.","Buijs, Sonja","['Brosschot, J.F.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Having a low socioeconomic status (SES) and limited access to green space is associated with negative health effects. From the perspective of the Generalized Unsafety Theory of Stress (GUTS), people who live in such a compromised social and physical context suffer from a constant default stress response. We hypothesized that low SES and lack of neighborhood green space are both associated with higher levels of chronic stress, measured in hair cortisol concentration. Hair cortisol is the first objective biomarker for chronic stress, which is increasingly used in research. Objectives: The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess whether chronic stress due to low socioeconomic status and/or lack of green environment can be recognized in hair cortisol levels. Method: Systematic literature search of the Web of Science database yielded 5 relevant papers for green space and 19 papers for socioeconomic status. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted for each outcome, where after meta-regression analyses were performed for possible moderators. Results: Analyzing five studies (n = 641) showed that more green space was associated with lower hair cortisol concentration (r = -.17, p < .001). The 19 studies of SES (n = 6023) contained 30 subsamples, based on the SES indicators: education, income, and total SES score. A higher income was significantly associated with lower hair cortisol concentration (r = -.11, p < .001). No associations were found between hair cortisol and education (r = -.06, p = .10), and total SES (r = .02, p = .85). Due to the lack of articles including green environment and SES, we could not analyze their relative contribution as well as their interaction effect on hair cortisol. Conclusions: These findings suggest that people with a higher income, and more neighborhood green space have lower levels of chronic stress. These outcomes contribute to the existing research about health disparities and the role of chronic stress, while also adding to the growing body of hair cortisol research as an objective and non-invasive stress biomarker. Future research is recommended with diverse samples including socioeconomic status and neighborhood green space, to gain a better understanding on the impact of individual and environmental factors on chronic stress.","['Hair cortisol, Generalized Unsafety Theory of Stress , socioeconomic status, green space']"

Freedom of Information and Political Opportunities during the Arab Spring,"Schiavo Campo de Gregorio, Tommaso","['Jentzsch, C.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research attempts to show how information availability contributed to the rise of political opportunities during the Arab Spring and consequently led the way to mobilization. More precisely, this paper is an effort to provide an answer to the subsequent question: 'How did political opportunities lead to collective mobilization during the Arab Spring?'. What this paper brings to the literature is the application of the political process model, relative to freedom of information and the media environment, to the study of contention in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya. Building a theoretical framework based on the tenets of the political process model, this research \ uncovers the realities behind the uprisings, exploring the different mechanisms and causal pathways that lead to mobilization. The findings suggest three main systems through which political opportunities were seized and collectivized by the masses, subsequently transmuting into collective action, such as (1) dissemination of dissent, (2) strategic framing, and (3) resource mobilization. Overall, this paper extrapolates that higher levels of freedom in the information environment did lead to more opportunities for collective participation in contentious politics.","['Political Opportunities', 'Arab Spring', 'Media environment', 'Political process', 'Contentious Politics', 'Mobilization structures']"

A regional collective defense security organization, NATO, has expanded its global partnership to the Asia-Pacific region. This thesis seeks to research the impact of the military rise of China on NATO-led security cooperation among NATO and far yet like-minded countries. Comparative qualitative content analysis is conducted to elaborate on how the security implications of the rise of China engendered NATO to form global initiatives, analyzing two cases, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand. Theoretical expectations are based on Regional Security Complex Theory, which is anchored on constructivism: if NATO successfully securitizes China's rise, the ROK and NZ will create bilateral or multilateral security cooperation with NATO. This paper finds out that NATO successfully framed China as an identity and a military threat, and expanded security cooperation with the ROK and NZ based on common liberal norms and values.","['NATO', 'China', 'Rising powers', 'Korea', 'Security', 'International Relations']"
Empowerment by efficacy and eyewitnesses? self-efficacy and bystander behaviour on non-intervening victim self-blame during acts of sexual harassment,"Schouten, Robin",['Dr. M van Bommel'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Sexual harassment is a major problem in today’s society. It can cause psychological problems to victims. One of those problems is that victims may blame themselves for being harassed. This can eventually cause PTSD. Factors that might affect self-blame are social information and a perception of control. This study aims to determine if the perception of control can backfire if the victim is unable to stand up to the harassment. Furthermore, we try to find out if social information, conveyed by the behaviour of bystanders, can influence self-blame as well. The study sample comprised 240 women, aged 18-29. The women were divided between two self-efficacy (perceived control) conditions and four different bystander behaviour conditions. Eventually we had eight different groups. The results didn’t show that self-efficacy or bystander behaviour had any significant effect on self-blame. In our exploratory analysis we did find significant effects on sexual harassment myth acceptation. Those who were less likely to believe myths regarding harassment also scored lower on self-blame. This study was conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, research methods were limited. After the pandemic, new methods can be used to study the effect of self-efficacy and bystander behaviour on self-blame. Regarding myth acceptation, giving a potential victim insight in the suffering of those being harassed, may reduce self-blame during future events of harassment.","['self-efficacy', 'bystander behaviour', 'self-blame', 'sexual harassment', 'victim']"

De trade-off tussen stabiliteit en flexibiliteit: De mogelijkheid tot verhoging van neural gain gemeten in neurotypische en neurodivergente populaties,"Montenij, Eline","['Jongkees, B.J']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De in het brein bestaande balans tussen stabiliteit en flexibiliteit wordt gereguleerd door neural gain: de allocatie van cognitieve resources die leidt tot een grondige (stabiele) of een meer basale (flexibele) benadering van een stimulus. Een stabiele benadering kent een hoge mate van neural gain en levert de beste resultaten in taken met een hogere moeilijkheidsgraad van stimuli, bijvoorbeeld conflicterende stimuli-informatie. De flexibele benadering kent daarentegen een lage mate van neural gain en heeft tot gevolg dat er gemakkelijk gewisseld kan worden tussen taken. Eerder is in onderzoek van Musslick en collega’s (2019) gevonden dat participanten gain verlagen in taken die flexibiliteit vereisen. In dit onderzoek wordt de aanpassing van neural gain onderzocht aan de hand van stabiliteit en gekoppeld aan verschillende onderzoeksgroepen met kenmerken van ADHD of Autisme Spectrum Stoornis. Een computertaak met frequent congruente en frequent incongruente stimuli wordt gebruikt om de neural gain van de onderzoeksgroepen in beide condities te meten. Verwacht wordt dat participanten uit de ADHD populatie over een lagere en participanten uit de ASS populatie juist over een hogere baseline beschikken. Uit dit onderzoek is gebleken dat participanten in het algemeen hun neural gain niet significant aanpassen aan een stabiliteit-vereisende conditie en dat de verwachtingen voor de ADHD en ASS onderzoeksgroepen ook niet bleken te kloppen. Wel werden op gedragsniveau significante effecten van de conditie en transitie op reactietijden en error rates gevonden. Onderzoek naar de inzet van neural gain kan dus uitgebreid worden en daardoor leiden tot een beter begrip van de mogelijkheid van mensen om neural gain aan te passen, maar ook de bereidheid daartoe.","['Cognitive resources, stability-flexibility trade-off']"

Multi-informant data was gathered by selecting parent-child dyads (N = 157; 82% mothers, 51% boys; mean age children 12.61(SD = 2.62). On two separate occasions, two years apart, questionnaires were administered to the families by trained research assistants; parents reported on type (physical, psychological) and amount of interparental conflict in the family with the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale [CTS2] on T0. Children reported on their sense of emotional insecurity within the family with the Security in the Interparental System [SIS] on T0 as well as T2 and their level of experienced trauma symptoms with the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children [TSCC] on T2. Relationships between all variables were tested and, in line with the central hypothesis of the EST, mediating effects of children’s sense of emotional insecurity were analyzed on T0 and T2. Interparental conflict was shown to be positively associated with trauma symptoms in children. Interparental conflict was only positively related to emotional insecurity in children when both were measured at the same time (T0), there was no relationship with child-reported emotional insecurity two years later. For both T0 and T2, emotional insecurity was positively associated with trauma symptoms at T2. However, no mediating effects were found and so it must be concluded that this research makes no confirming contribution to the evidence base of the EST. Further analyses of emotional security indicates stability and continuity over time. Treatment in between measurements and general quality of parenting are discussed as possible explanations for the results. The study concludes with its limitations and recommendations.","['EST', 'emotional insecurity', 'interparental conflict', ""children's trauma symptoms""]"

Association of The Covid-19 Pandemic with Binge Eating and Emotional Eating: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis,"Güzel, Amine","['Molendijk, M']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Background: The abrupt spread of Covid-19 all over the world created a global crisis and resulted in a pandemic which led to various adverse mental health outcomes. Concordantly, studies reported an increasing trend in the prevalence and severity of binge eating and emotional eating symptoms. Aims: To estimate the prevalence and severity rates of binge eating and emotional eating symptoms during the Covid-19 pandemic through systematic review with meta-analysis. Methods: Pre-registered systematic review with meta-analysis (Prospero ID: CRD42022316105). Results: Systematic searches in PubMed and Web of Science (final search date 19th of March, 2022) yielded 27 eligible studies on changes in binge eating and emotional eating prevalence and severity rates during the Covid-19 outbreak (total N = 22.029). An overall increase in the elicited and exacerbated binge eating and emotional eating symptoms during the Covid-19 pandemic was observed (number of studies (k) = 14, r = 0.27, 95% CIs = 0.059 to 0.478). Furthermore, overall 7% of participants reported increases in pooled binge eating and emotional eating behaviours. Conclusions: Our data show a significant increase in the prevalence and severity rates of binge eating and emotional eating during the Covid-19 outbreak. This increase may be expected due to raised emotions of stress, loss of control, fear, ineffectiveness, and boredom during the pandemic. Public health policies and intervention programs for preventing and treating binge eating and emotional eating symptoms should be considered during confinement or related circumstances.","['Binge Eating', 'Emotional Eating', 'Covid-19', 'Pandemic', 'Corona', 'Lockdown']"

A correlation between the pandemic and anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa also has been reported in some studies, but not in all. We aim to estimate the changes in severity and prevalence rates of Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and Bulimia Nervosa (BN) pathology in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic through meta-analysis. Method Pre-registered systematic review with meta-analysis (Prospero ID: CRD42022316105). Results The systematic searches that were performed in PubMed and Web of Science (final search date 18th of March 2022) yielded 34 eligible studies. Overall, studies showed more severe AN and BN symptomatology (r = 0.19, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.30 and r = 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.31 respectively) during the pandemic versus prior to the pandemic. Additionally, AN and BN self-reported prevalence rates have increased during the pandemic (rpooled = 0.35, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.45 and rpooled = 0.29, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.33 respectively). Conclusions Our data show that at the onset of the pandemic, the severity and prevalence of AN and BN pathology increased in people with preexisting ED’s as well as in healthy samples. This may be due to pandemic-induced feelings of stress and lack of control. Our findings encourage policymakers to develop prevention and intervention programs for ED’s, especially during stressful times like a pandemic.","['Eating disorders, Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, COVID-19, Corona, Lockdown']"

The aim of this study is to understand the applicability of the uncertainty identity theory to purchase intention for national and international brands. It was suggested brand identity and brand attachment can be the underlying mechanism between economic uncertainty and purchase intention and that these relationships are strengthened or weakened by brand nationality. No effect of economic uncertainty on purchase intention was found nor was it found that brand identity and brand attachment were underlying mechanisms of this relationship which insinuated it was also not strengthened of weakened by brand nationality. The results found contradict the expectations based on previous research. As an addition, it was shown that brand identity and brand attachment are to be theorized differently since they have different underlying psychological constructs and have minimal overlap when using the right measures to measure these constructs. This study complements existing literature on brand relationships and gives insight in the dynamic changes brought about by COVID-19. Limitations of the current study and advice for follow-up research are discussed.","['Economic uncertainty, students, brand identity, brand attachment purchase intention, national brands, international brands.']"

Prosocial Giving Behaviour of Gifted and Non-Gifted Adolescents: The Role of Empathy and Self- Concept,"Ridder, Naomi De",['Kiki Zanolie'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study examined how empathy and self-concept influence giving to friends, fathers, mothers, disliked people, and strangers in gifted and non-gifted adolescents. Adolescents (N = 141, ages 9 – 12 years) from both gifted and non-gifted education played a Dictator Game in which they divided coins between themselves and one of five other targets. The Dutch versions of the Self-Perception Profile for Children and the Interpersonal Reactivity index were used to measure global self-concept, social acceptance (measures of self-concept), perspective-taking, and empathic concern (measures of empathy), respectively. The Raven Standard Progressive Matrices task was used as a measure of intelligence. We found that the number of coins that adolescents donated during the Dictator Game differed significantly between the targets (F(3, 464) = 120.32, p < .001, η 2 partial = .47). Adolescents donated most coins to their friends, father, and mother, less to an unknown person, and least to a disliked person. The number of coins adolescents gave away to the different targets did not differ significantly for gifted and non- gifted adolescents (F(3, 464) = 0.92, p = .437, η 2 partial = .01). Non-gifted adolescents showed higher levels of global self-concept and social acceptance than gifted adolescents, but they did not differ in perspective-taking and empathic concern. We found that global self-concept, social acceptance, empathic concern, and perspective-taking did not significantly mediate the relationship between giftedness and mean giving behaviour. Empathy and self-concept did not predict how many coins adolescents gave away in total. However, higher levels of perspective- taking were associated with more giving behaviour towards a disliked person (r = .18, p < .05). Overall, our findings suggest that gifted and non-gifted adolescents show similar levels of context-dependent giving behaviour, and that this is not influenced by empathy or self-concept.",

Er wordt gekeken of de energiebron op het werk, steun van collega’s, leidt tot een hogere mate van herstelactiviteiten in de vrije tijd, sportdeelname (sportdoor en sportintensiteit), via vertrouwen in eigen kunnen. Ook wordt er gekeken of deze relatie zwakker is voor mensen die meer burn-outklachten ervaren. Om de hypotheses te testen hebben werknemers drie weken lang wekelijks een vragenlijst ingevuld (N=131). Ook zijn demografische gegevens, stabiele gevoelens en gedragingen, zoals burn-out, eenmalig bevraagd aan de deelnemers. Hiërarchische regressie analyses zijn uitgevoerd om de data te analyseren. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat er een significante positieve directe relatie is tussen de steun van collega’s en de sportduur in de vrije tijd. Echter zorgt steun van collega’s via vertrouwen in eigen kunnen niet voor een langere sportduur. Bovendien is er niet aangetoond dat de voorgestelde indirecte relatie zwakker is voor mensen die meer burn-outklachten ervaren. Er is in dit onderzoek dus gedeeltelijk bewijs gevonden voor de opwaartse herstelspiraal, maar vertrouwen in eigen kunnen blijkt hier geen rol in te spelen.

Influence of Strategy on Motor Performance and Retention: How internal and external focus of attention influences motor learning on a computer-based task,"Suchecki, Damian","['Ketel, J.E. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Aim: The impact of foci of attention during performance and learning has been shown in many studies. An external focus of attention seems to be a more effective instructional method than an internal focus (Wulf, 2013). However, most of these studies happen in a physical environment, and few focus on a computer-based environment. Since there is a growing number of instances where complex motor skills are needed in computerized environments (e.g., Laparoscopic surgeries), there is a growing need for more effective training instructions. This 2-day study investigated if an external focus yields better performance and retention on a complex motor computer task compared to an internal focus. Methods: A sample size of N=14 (Nexternal=6, Ninternal=8, Mage=23, SD=3, with an age range of 19-28) was used. Two paired sample t-tests were used to investigate if there is an improvement within both conditions, and 2 Mann-Whitney U tests to analyze the difference between the conditions on motor performance and on retention. Focus questions were asked between blocks of trials. Results: There was improvement within both conditions, but there was no difference between both conditions on motor performance and retention. Furthermore, participants’ adherence to the instructions was mixed. Conclusion: Non-adherence might have influenced the results. In the future, removing the conditions and its instructions to investigate the focus of attention in a more natural manner as well as using different equipment resembling what is used in the professional field should be considered.

The Effect of Activism and Sexist Discrimination on Depression and Anxiety Symptoms in Female Students,"Helman, Mattan",['Dr. Niki Antypa'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Sexist discrimination is a social issue that has a negative impact on the mental health of females. Some studies have suggested that activism may be an adaptive coping strategy in facing discrimination. The objectives of the current study were to explore activism as a protective factor against the effects of sexist discrimination on depression and anxiety symptoms in female students. The study used data of 189 Leiden University female students who completed a survey with the following scales: Sexist Discrimination, Conventional Activism (CA), High-Risk Activism and Loneliness. Two hierarchical regression analyses and two moderation analyses were conducted on the mental health outcomes: anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results showed that experiencing sexist discrimination was positively correlated to depression and anxiety symptoms. However, CA was not related to depression and anxiety. In addition, CA was not found as a moderator in the relationship between sexist discrimination and the mental health outcomes. This may be explained by the assumption that activism serves as an adaptive coping strategy in certain social groups only when it matches specific discrimination. The current study is a reminder of the impact of sexist discrimination on female students' mental health and emphasizes the importance of addressing it in society and therapy. The current study does not support that activism protects the mental health of female students in facing sexist discrimination. However, the research of activism as a coping strategy is only in its beginning stages and future research is needed.",

The verbal transmission of social anxiety from parents to adolescents,"Bailey, Liam","['Aktar, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The development of social anxiety, which is highly prevalent and persistent in adolescents, heavily depends on predisposing factors, such as behavioral inhibition, and environmental influences, such as parenting, particularly via verbal learning. This study investigated whether social fears can be verbally transmitted from parents to their adolescent children (N = 72, M = 11.67 years; 54.5% girls) by exploring whether standardized threat information about a stranger leads to higher fear beliefs in contrast to safety information about another stranger, and whether behavioral inhibition has a moderating role by exacerbating this verbal transmission of fear. The adolescents were provided with this information before performing a social interaction task with each of two strangers acting as judges, who were unaware whether they were paired with threat or safety information. Behavioral inhibition scores were assessed via parent and child reports prior to the verbal threat or safety information transfer, while fear beliefs were reported by the adolescents after the social task. In line with previous literature, adolescents reported higher fear beliefs for the strangers associated with threat information than for those associated with safety information. No significant moderation by behavioral inhibition was found, though parentally reported child behavioral inhibition positively predicted overall fear beliefs. Conclusively, social fears may be verbally transmitted from parents to adolescents via threat or safety information affecting fear beliefs. Limitations are discussed and further research to ascertain the full scope of this effect and implications is encouraged.",
Trust in Automation: The Impact of Experience on Development of Trust in Level 2 (Partial Automation) vehicles,"Cupic, Katarina",['Dr. Francesco Walker'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Car manufacturers are increasingly investing in developing automated (self-driving) technology to reduce the number of fatalities caused by human errors and increase safety on roads. Research has shown that safe and effective human-automation interactions largely depend on trust in such a technology. To prevent danger on roads, aligning the driver's trust with the actual reliability of the vehicle is vital. In this study, we used two different dashcam videos to examine the evolution of drivers' self-reported trust in a driving simulator from before having experienced, immediately after having experienced, and approximately 5-7 days after having experienced a Level 2 (partial automation) vehicle. Furthermore, we investigated whether the order of videos watched impacted self-reported trust scores. We expected both dashcam videos to be comparable. Moreover, we expected self-reported trust to decrease from pre- to post-test and further at the follow-up. Contrary to our expectations, we found a significant increase in self-reported trust from pre- to post-test. Moreover, we found that the direction in which trust evolves is dependent on the order in which the videos were watched.",
Do Individual Differences in Visual Mental Imagery Enhance Grapheme-Colour Synaesthesia Training?,"Nesbit, Emma",['Nicholas Root'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Grapheme-colour synaesthesia describes a condition in which individuals experience specific colours, after having visually perceived achromatic letters. Having synaesthesia has been linked to certain cognitive enhancements, such as improved memory. Interestingly, synaesthesia training makes it possible for non-synaesthetes to acquire synaesthesia-like experiences, and there is some evidence that non-synaesthetes with better visuo-perceptual abilities might be easier to train. This study investigates whether individual differences in visual mental imagery influence the speed of learning in synaesthesia training. To this end, visual mental imagery was assessed in a sample of non-synaesthetes using two self-report questionnaires and a behavioural measure, the Animal Tails Task (ATT). The ATT is significantly correlated with the consistency of letter-colour choices both before and after synaesthesia training. However, the ATT did not significantly predict the size of the beneficial effect of acquired synaesthesia on the learning of a new language (Arabic letter-pronunciation pairings). In conclusion, individual differences in visual mental imagery influence the speed of synaesthesia training itself, but do not appear to influence the downstream benefits of synaesthesia training. These findings not only have implications for future synaesthesia training studies, but also for research on the link between synaesthesia, perception and memory.","['grapheme-colour synaesthesia, visual mental imagery, synaesthesia training']"
The Effectiveness of Flexibility-Persistence and Reward-Avoidance Sensitivity Trait Biases in Predicting Impulsivity-Compulsivity,"Meij, Pieter van der","['Prochazkova, L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The traditional approach to research and diagnosis in psychiatry has been to focus on one specific diagnostic criterium at a time (DSM-5). Recent criticism suggests a transdiagnostic method that focuses more on underlying behavioral and cognitive traits to predict vulnerability to disorders such as OCD, ADHD, and eating disorders. Among these traits are impulsivity and compulsivity. According to the traditional model, impulsivity and compulsivity exist as a spectrum that is thought to be influenced by reward and avoidance sensitivity. In addition, this work proposes the use of the Metacontrol State Model (Hommel, 2015) in order to explore the Impulsivity-Compulsivity spectrum at the hand of flexibility and persistence. This study aims to explore to what extent reward-avoidance sensitivity and flexibility-persistence can account for Impulsivity-Compulsivity. 41 participants partook in this study that measured Impulsivity-Compulsivity using the S-UPPS, flexibility-persistence using the Stroop task and the AUT, and reward-avoidance sensitivity as per the MID. A multiple linear regression analysis found that trait biases towards the Metacontrol states flexibility-persistence positively predicted the Impulsivity-Compulsivity spectrum. Additionally, reward sensitivity negatively predicted impulsivity, the opposite of what was theorized. This relationship is explored with the help of more recent research, which suggests that the traditional model of reward-avoidance sensitivity oversimplifies Impulsivity-Compulsivity. However, results were found to be inconsistent. Thus, this work suggests that the relationship between reward-avoidance sensitivity and the Impulsivity-Compulsivity spectrum is further explored. In addition, this work provides preliminary evidence in favor of the Metacontrol State Model as a transdiagnostic tool.","['Impulsivity', 'Compulsivity', 'Flexibility', 'Persistence', 'Reward Sensitivity', 'Avoidance Sensitivity', 'Metacontrol State Model']"
"Pruritus and Attentional Bias: The effect of gender, depression and anxiety on attentional bias in a population afflicted by chronic itch","Vivier, Kerry-Anne","['Becker, J']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This project investigated if there was any association between attentional bias (AB) towards itch-related stimuli and depression and anxiety scores in patients with chronic itch compared to healthy controls. This study also explored if gender had an influence on any of these variables. An orientation dot-probe task with pictures adjusted to chronic itch was used as a measurement of AB. 16 pairings of a neutral image and an itch-related image which were displayed on screen for 500ms, either image was then replaced by two dots in either a horizontal or vertical orientation. Participants responded as quickly as possible to the orientation of the dots. The average reaction times were used to calculate an AB index for each participant. There were 6 participants in total: 5 with chronic itch and 1 healthy control. Patients with chronic itch were diagnosed with either psoriasis or atopic dermatitis(eczema). Participants also completed questionnaires including the DASS-21. Results showed that patients did not have higher levels of depression and anxiety symptomatology compared to the healthy control. There was no significant effect of group on AB indexes; the reaction times were not faster in patients with chronic itch compared to the healthy control. There was no significant effect of gender on depression and anxiety scores, or on AB. Future research is suggested to improve psychometric properties of AB paradigms. Likewise, this project calls for increased research into treatment possibilities for chronic itch, not only for somatic symptoms but for the emotional, cognitive, and behavioural consequences of these conditions.","['attention', 'attentional bias', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'pruritus', 'chronic itch', 'ezcema', 'psoriasis']"
How do stereotypes mediate the relationship between ideology and antisocial behaviour towards the out-group?,"Rovers, Sterre","['Pliskin, R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Political ideology has been at the center of social psychology research over the years. Researchers are trying to find out whether rightists and leftists have fundamental differences, or whether this can be attributed to context. I am researching if the relationship between ideology and anti-social behaviour towards the out-group is mediated by stereotypes about morality, warmth, competence, and aggression of that out-group. Research has confirmed higher support for aggressive measures by rightists over leftists. Therefore, I argued that there will be a difference in anti-social behaviour/tendencies between rightists and leftists. Furthermore, research regarding stereotypes also shows how these affect behaviour. Thus I hypothesised that both leftists and rightists will engage in anti-social behaviour when holding a negative stereotype about the target group. This was tested using an online-based experiment, where participants were asked to play two economic games (Joy of Destruction and Attacker-Defender game) and fill out a questionnaire. First, two logistic regression analyses were performed to test whether there are anti-social behaviour differences towards the out-group depending on ideology. This was significant. Second, several mediation analyses were performed to see whether the relationship between ideology and anti-social behaviour is mediated by stereotypes. Some of these mediation analyses were found to be significant, showing that anti-social behaviour can vary depending on ideology through stereotypes as a mediating variable.",
Racial Bias Online: The Effect of Emotion and Facial Cues on our Judgements.,"Achenbach, Ljudmila","['Varma, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"New forms of explicit racism find their way on social media platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter, through hate speech and social exclusion. This study looks at mechanisms behind social judgment online and the influence of race and emotion. An online experiment was designed to test whether Black faces are rated as less friendly compared to White (hypothesis 1) and whether positive Tweets lead to a higher friendliness rating compared to negative or neutral (hypothesis 2). Further, an interaction effect between race and emotionality on friendliness judgment was assessed assuming that the difference between friendliness rating of Black and White faces depends on the emotionality of the Tweet (hypothesis 3). Finally, a questionnaire was administered to test for cultural diversity awareness (CDA), assuming heightened CDA is connected to less racial bias (hypothesis 4). Findings indicate that there is a significant effect of race on friendliness decision, but contrasting hypothesis 1 it was revealed that Black faces were instead rated as more friendly. The effect of emotionality was found significant, indicating that positive Tweets lead to higher friendliness ratings. The interaction effect was non-significant and no difference in friendliness judgment between the two races across the emotionality categories was found. Lastly, a significant negative correlation was found between CDA and racial bias, suggesting a positive influence of CDA. The findings give an important indication for the role racial biases and emotionality play in judgment formation.","['emotions', 'judgement', 'racial bias', 'cultural diversity awareness', 'online judgements', 'friendliness decisions']"

Relationship between Attentional Control and Poor Sleep Quality: Mediation via Rumination,"Grozdanovska, Mila","['Aksungur, S.U.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Previous research suggests an association between attentional control and rumination, supported by the impaired disengagement hypothesis. According to the impaired disengagement hypothesis, individuals with low attentional control are more likely to experience increased rumination due to difficulties in disengaging from negative thoughts. A relationship between rumination and poor sleep quality has also been previously investigated and the findings are in line with the concept of perseverative cognition. As illustrated by the concept of perseverative cognition, rumination has been associated with poor sleep quality because the cognitive arousal that accompanies rumination may lead to physiological arousal resulting in unsuitable conditions for quality sleep. However, the potential mediating role of rumination in the relationship between attentional control and sleep quality has not yet been fully elucidated. The primary aim of the current study was to investigate whether rumination significantly mediates the relationship between attentional control and sleep quality. I expected increased rumination to mediate the relationship between low attentional control and poor subjective sleep quality. 69 healthy university students completed questionnaires including measures of attentional control, rumination, and sleep quality. A mediation analysis and a bootstrap was employed to test the significance of the indirect effects. Results showed that rumination fully mediated that effects of attentional control on sleep quality. A bootstrap analysis confirmed the significance of the mediation model. Targeting attentional control and rumination may prove beneficial in treatments for poor sleep quality. Interventions such as mindfulness-based therapy have been successful in reducing rumination, whereas attentional training technique has shown promising results in improving attentional control.","['mediation', 'attentional control', 'rumination', 'sleep quality']"
The association between speech patterns and levels of gaze anxiety in a face-to-face conversation,"Bolt, Nienke",['J. Chen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Introduction: Gaze anxiety is defined as the fear about making eye-contact in various social situations. Even though eye-contact is an important factor during social interactions, there is a lack of studies on the particular gaze-anxiety matter. It is as yet unclear how gaze anxiety shapes aspects of social communication, such as vocal characteristics. Using a face-to-face conversation, the present study sought to examine whether gaze anxiety would influence voice characteristics, in particular speech rate and voice pitch. Method: In total 32 participants (26 women and 6 men) with an age between 18-30 years old took part in this study. Participants were having a face-to-face conversation with a same-sex confederate, while their auditory data was recorded using a auditor tracker. The participants filled in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), the Gaze Anxiety Rating Scale (GARS), and the prior and post conversation Subjective Units of Discomfort Scale (SUDS). Results: The results showed that there was no significant correlation between gaze anxiety and speech rate. However, the results did show a positive significant correlation between gaze anxiety and voice pitch. Meaning that a higher gaze anxiety resulted in a higher voice pitch. Additionally, there was a significant effect of time on pitch. However, no other significant results or effects were found. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of studying gaze anxiety and its effects on social communication. Several important limitations, including participant size, age range, and experimental settings were discussed. Additionally, future research could study gaze anxiety in more detail together with speech patterns.","['Gaze anxiety', 'Eye contact anxiety', 'Speech patterns', 'Rate', 'Pitch', 'Face-to-face conversation']"
The Influence of Social Anxiety on Face Gaze Behaviour and the Modulating Effect of Gaze Direction During a Face-to-Face Conversation,"Achda, Amyra Juliandra","['Chen, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Gaze to faces plays a vital role in communicating and perceiving social cues from one’s partner during social interactions. Visual avoidance of faces has been proposed to be a behavioural indicator of social anxiety. Furthermore, initial evidence suggests that an interaction partner’s direct gaze is perceived as more threatening than an averted gaze. This study investigated the influence of social anxiety on face gaze behaviour and whether the gaze direction modulates the effect of social anxiety on face gaze behaviour during a face-to-face conversation. 34 participants (82.4% female, 17.6% male) and confederate took turns answering a given set of questions about general topics. The gaze direction of the confederate was systematically manipulated to either look directly towards or turn away from the participant’s face. Participants’ face gaze behaviour was recorded using the Tobii Glasses 2 wearable eye tracker device and measured by calculating the total duration of fixation on the face and the proportion of fixation counts on the face. The results indicate that participants with varying levels of social anxiety did not display different face gaze behaviour during a face-to-face conversation. Moreover, an interaction partner’s gaze direction did not enhance nor diminish the effect of social anxiety on face gaze behaviour. The current findings suggest that social anxiety has no significant influence on participants' face gaze behaviour during a face-to-face conversation. Future research may consider using controversial conversation topics in order to induce a more threatening social situation.","['""Social anxiety"" AND ""face gaze behaviour"" AND ""visual avoidance"" AND ""averted gaze"" AND ""direct gaze"" AND ""visual attention"" AND ""social interaction"" AND ""face-to-face conversation"" AND ""social situation"" AND ""eye tracker""']"
Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation in Humans does not Attenuate Alpha Oscillations,"Lennaárd, Hampus",['Franz Wurm'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) is a recently developed method of Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS). VNS has demonstrated neuromodulatory effects which clinically lead to reduced seizure activity. In this replication attempt we investigate the robustness of findings that tVNS decreases arousal, measured through changes in alpha activity (Sharon et al., 2020). In contrast, findings indicate that tVNS did not significantly impact alpha activity and arousal. These findings contrast accumulating evidence which lend support to the notion that tVNS does activates the same arousal-promoting noradrenergic network of the LC-NE system. The findings further divide the inconsistent results in the litterature in regards to weather tVNS mimic the effect of VNS. Because of this continued inconsistency, questions regarding replicability and validity are asked and more data is needed to clarify whether tVNS will be able to replace VNS for patients experiencing seizures. The potential of reducing seizure activity without the same surgical risks associated with VNS carries great weight for the clinical community. Given our findings it seems that Sharon et al. (2020)’s findings are not as robust as thought. Important to note is that multiple biological markers indicative of changes in brain arousal have been used to quantify the neuromodulatory effect of tVNS. Wheather tVNS activates the same mechanisms that lie behind the effectiveness of VNS is not yet clear. Changes in alpha activity are elusive but other biological markers have shown more robust and consistent results. As such, future studies are warrented to clarify the inconsistency.","['alpha oscillations, eeg, noradrenaline, lc-ne system, tVNS']"

Associations between Attachment Style and Self-esteem Fluctuations in Response to Social Feedback based on Simulated Data,"Klink, Abygail van","['Will, G.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Self-esteem is a vital predictor of mental health and well-being. One of the most important influences on our self-esteem is the appraisal we receive from others. How we process these appraisals depends on our attachment style, as this forms the way we see others and ourselves. This study examined how attachment style modulates the impact of social feedback on state self-esteem. Due to social distancing measures enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person testing was not possible and therefore I tested my hypotheses using simulated associations between attachment and self-esteem fluctuations. I collected self-report data on attachment style and trait self-esteem in 78 participants and matched these data to data from 78 participants with identical trait self-esteem scores. The latter group performed a social evaluation task in which they received feedback and repeatedly reported on their self-esteem throughout. Results indicated that social approval increases self-esteem and disapproval decreases it. I found no evidence of attachment style modulating these self-esteem dynamics. This might be explained by the source of feedback, namely strangers. In previously conducted research a relationship between attachment style and self-esteem dynamics was found when the source of feedback was a romantic partner. These different results might be explained by the different social dynamics, and sheds light on what does and what does not have an influence on our state of self-esteem and mental health.","['self-esteem fluctuations, social feedback, attachment style']"

The Role of Living Arrangements and Social Support in Students With Suicidal Ideation,"Döring, Christina","['Bahamondes Álvarez, R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Suicide is the fourth leading death cause in young adults (WHO, 2021). Although there are multiple theories about suicidal behaviour, critics emphasize the importance of social determinants on mental health. Lund et al. (2018) designed a conceptual framework of social determinants of mental health entailing different domains. Objective: This thesis focused on the social domain, by analysing living arrangements, social support, measured by ISEL-12, and suicidal ideation, measured by SIDAS. The research question was if perceived social support moderates the relationship between living arrangements and suicidal ideation in university students aged 17 to 26. Hypothesis A was: Living arrangements predict suicidal ideation in students. B: Perceived social support moderates the relationship between living arrangements and suicidal ideation, and C: There is a difference between students displaying and not displaying suicidal ideation, and their living arrangements. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 139 students from Leiden University. A hierarchical regression and a chi-square analysis were performed to investigate the hypotheses. Results: The first step of the hierarchical regression analysis revealed an insignificant prediction of suicidal ideation by living arrangements (p=.354). The second step including social support variables was found to contribute significantly to the model (p<.001). Results of the chi square analysis were insignificant (p=.371). Conclusion: We concluded that there is no correlation between living arrangements and suicidal ideation which is why there is no moderation effect by social support either. No significant difference between the groups with and without suicidal ideation and their living arrangements were found.","['Suicidal Ideation, Social Determinants, Living Arrangements, Social Support, Nonclinical Population, Students, Cross-sectional']"

Studies have suggested that higher levels of family conflict increase the levels of suicidal ideation experienced by individuals. Objective: To address and understand this issue better, the following research aimed to identify a relationship between family conflict and suicidal ideation, as well as to discover which subscale, if not both, of family conflict (physical and emotional neglect) would be a significant predictor of suicidal ideation. Method: A non-clinical sample of 133 Leiden University students aged 17 to 26 were recruited. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS) were used to test the hypotheses. Results: Results revealed a significant relationship between family conflict and suicidal ideation (r (133) = .230, p= .008). Results further revealed that emotional neglect was a significant predictor of suicidal ideation (F (2,130) = 2.065, p= .041), whereas physical neglect was not (F (2,130) =.007, p= .994). Conclusions: Professionals, and importantly universities, should be more conscientious and aware of the impact that both past and current family problems/conflict can have on adolescents’ and young adults’ experiences with suicidal ideation.","['Suicide', 'Suicidal Ideation', 'Family problems/conflict', 'Neglect', 'Social Determinants']"

The Social Determinants of Mental Health (SDoMH) model attempts to understand well-being from the novel perspective of one’s socio-economic environment. As suicidal ideation remains ill-understood, the SDoMH model can be utilized to achieve new insights. Objective: This investigation aimed to understand the relation between suicidal ideation and social connectedness, and how student nationality moderates this relationship. Methods: A convenience sample (n = 139) of students in the Netherlands completed a cross-sectional questionnaire about suicidal ideation. The variables of interest were suicidal ideation, social connectedness, and nationality. To measure suicidal ideation, the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale was used and to measure social connectedness the Social Connectedness Scale-Revised was implemented. Results: Social connectedness and suicidal ideation had a significant relationship, with greater social connectedness correlating to lower suicidal ideation (𝑝 < 0. 001). Nationality as a moderator variable was found to be non-significant in this investigation (p = 0.731). Conclusion: Social connectedness is a significant social determinant of suicidal ideation.

Linking closure and food waste: A survey study on the effects of Need for Closure on healthy and unhealthy food waste across age,"Marx, Florian",['Ambra Brizi'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Household food waste threatens our environment by accelerating climate change and by creating a high economic burden every year. Thus, there is an obvious necessity for understanding and thereby battling household food waste. Based on previous research on this topic conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic, in which the need for cognitive closure was negatively related to food waste, this research investigated how the cognitive construct of need for closure impacts food waste intentions and food waste behavior. Further, how age influences this relationship was assessed. A sample size of 210 participants was used. The analyses did not show a significant association of need for closure with food waste intentions (B = -.11, p = .556, 95%CI [-.48, .26])); in addition, need for closure was shown to not impact the healthiness of food wasted (B = -.11, p = .556, 95%CI [-.48, .26]). Lastly, age did not impact any of these relationships. Considering previous research findings, it becomes apparent that the Covid-19 pandemic increased food waste behaviors in people with high NFC, but this effect seems to not be generalizable to the context outside of Covid-19. Furthermore, considering the difference between prevalence of food waste intentions and behavior across age, a necessity for action guidance becomes obvious among younger generations. This way, their high motivation to reduce food waste can be transformed into actual behavior to reduce global warming.","['Closure, Food Waste, Intentions, Age, Healthy, Unhealthy']"

Covid Status and Depressive Symptoms.

There are studies available comparing pandemic-onset depressive symptoms between some of the different covid status groups, but no study compared all of the groups together. Therefore, there are still substantial research gaps that are being filled by this study. Additionally, it is not yet known how the household size and the type of household occupants influence depressive symptoms in the infected population. Thus, the current study investigates differences in depressive symptoms between covid status groups, household sizes and type of household occupants, through a cross-sectional online questionnaire (n=150). Two scales were used to measure depressive symptoms: HADS and the PHQ-9. We observed scores of 15.73 on PHQ-9 which fall in the category of mild depression and scores of 10 when using HADS-Depression which is considered normal. However, in our ANOVAs we did not find significant differences between covid status groups and household sizes. Nevertheless, the third hypothesis concerning the variable type of household occupants, was partially confirmed since only one of the results supports it. Our findings are limited due to low power and due to the fact that the relationship between the household occupants was not investigated. Further studies should use a bigger, more representative sample and should investigate the type of relationship between the occupants because the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic should be closely examined. Afterall any depressive symptoms should receive proportional attention.",

Participants filled out an online survey containing several self-report measures. The results found that mystical experiences predicted higher self-esteem and that this effect is mediated by trait mindfulness. Secondly, a positive association between ego inflation and exploitative-entitled narcissism was found. We did not find EE narcissism to predict lower ego dissolution scores and no effect of mediation practice on spiritual narcissism.

Food Waste Intentions and Anticipated Guilt and the Moderating role of Gender,"Chapman, Kristjan Thor",['Ambra Brizi'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The objective of this study was to investigate whether individuals who have higher levels of anticipated guilt tend to waste less food, and does a higher level of anticipated guilt affect the moral motivations of an individual in wasting healthy or unhealthy food, in addition to see if the relationship is moderated by gender. Respondents were asked to fill in a questionnaire and the final sample consisted of 210 respondents which consisted of 43.3% of males, 53.8% of females and 2.9% of Non-binary/third gender with a mean age of 33.07 years (SD = 11.26). Measuring instruments used to test the hypotheses were the adapted Food Waste Intention Scale, The General Moral Motivation Index towards healthy vs unhealthy food and the Moral Scale. The findings showed that high levels of anticipated guilt and food waste intentions were significant. However, the moderation of gender was found to be non-significant. In addition to, the moral motivations towards wasting healthy versus unhealthy food were non-significant. The findings found were consistent with previous research that an individual’s level of anticipated guilt does have an effect on the intention of food waste.","['Anticipated Guilt, Food Waste Intentions, Gender, Moral Motivations']"

Gender Differences in Executive Functions Among School-Aged Children: Inhibition and Working memory: Meta-Analysis,"Rudakova, Aliaksandra",['L.M.Wierenga'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Normal development of Executive Functions (EF) and their components are crucial for children’s everyday functioning as well as for their future academic success. The two EF segments: Inhibition and Working Memory are considered reliable predictors of school performance. Contributing to better understanding of gender differences (based on biological sex) in mentioned EF components, it was attempted to further understand possible underlying mechanisms that could differ per gender, of the latest reported girls’ advantage in academic performance. The most recent studies’ data was collected and analyzed on the performance of boys and girls from 6 to 12 years old in Inhibition and Working Memory. A total of 13 studies were included in the analysis: 11 for both Inhibition and Working Memory and two for each EF component separately. No significant results were obtained for gender differences in Inhibition (p = .21), or Working Memory (p =.13). However, high heterogeneity was reported for both EF components. The value for heterogeneity remained to be high after the performed test on subgroup differences with two measurement types (Report vs. Task) as a grouping variable for both EF elements, results of which were also not significant. The findings of the present paper supported the EF global performance gender equivalence theory among school-age children. The need for further research on gender differences in EF components, specifically in children 6 to 12 years old was underlined, due to the heterogeneity and underrepresentation of the related scientific literature. In addition, the present paper provides the data for the developmental framework on typical gender compared cognitive development of young children. Which could contribute to the minimization of the phenomena of over diagnosing behavioral and learning disorders.",
Emotions in Context: Cross-Species Perceptual Integration of Emotional Cues with Facial Expressions,"Papadimakopoulou, Chrysoula",['Kim Y.'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Attention towards emotional expressions is pivotal for navigating the social world, for both human and non-human primates. This study investigated how humans integrate contextual emotional cues with facial expressions of humans and chimpanzees using a priming design with dynamic emotional scenes as primers and facial expression images as test stimuli, alongside eye-tracking. Conspecific results did not show significant differences based on primer scene (fearful, happy, social neutral, asocial neutral) or faces (happy, fearful) observed, and no priming effect. Since humans did attend to the congruent emotional faces for slightly longer in the emotional primer conditions the possible of a priming effect was still considered, despite it not being significant. Heterospecific results suggested no signs of a priming effect and an overall attentional bias towards negative chimpanzee facial expressions. The results thus demonstrate possible differences in emotion perception across species observed and emotional biases towards facial expressions of humans and chimpanzees were compared descriptively. All in all, the absence of significant conspecific priming effects along with concerns about the nature of the dynamic stimuli used, study design and low statistical power and other limitations were discussed and future attempts to investigate and explore emotion perception through priming is encouraged.","['emotion perception, eye-tracking, chimpanzees, contextual emotional cues, body language']"

Risk-taking is part of a proneness to problematic behaviour and a tendency to engage in behaviours with uncertain outcomes that are possibly negative (Nathanson, 2015). In this study, the risk-taking variable is tested through the use of The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) (Lejuez, 2002). The predicting variables, hypomanic personality traits and substance use, are assessed with questionnaires. These are the Hypomanic Personality Scale-Short Form (Sperry, 2015), and the CRAFFT questionnaire (Skogen et al., 2013), respectively. This study consists of a sample of N=66. After a statistical analysis of simple linear regression, it was discovered that none of the associations were statistically significant. This means that this paper found no support for the notion that there is any relationship between risk-taking behaviour, hypomanic personality traits, and substance use. In the discussion section of this paper, I will discuss possible explanations for these findings. Here, I will also describe how future research should look into different variables that might correlate with risk-taking behaviour.",
Is Maladaptive Emotion Regulation Predicted by Emotional Neglect and Emotional Abuse in Childhood?,"Bördgen, Antonia","['Reinken, Aischa']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Childhood maltreatment is associated with various adverse outcomes. Emotional maltreatment, namely emotional neglect and emotional abuse, is the most prevalent form of maltreatment, yet does not always receive according attention in research. Possible consequences of emotional maltreatment in childhood are difficulties with emotion regulation (ER). Maladaptive ER is linked to several negative outcomes, such as dysfunctional behaviours and increased psychopathological symptoms. The different effects of emotional neglect and emotional abuse on specific maladaptive behavioural emotion regulation strategies (withdrawal, ignoring) and maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies (self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing) are still not entirely understood and were investigated in the current study. Self-reports on childhood maltreatment and ER were collected with overall n= 401 respondents included in the study. Five multiple regression analyses were performed to assess whether childhood emotional neglect predicted maladaptive cognitive ER strategies and childhood emotional abuse predicted maladaptive behavioural ER strategies. Higher scores of emotional abuse were found to positively predict the behavioural ER strategy withdrawal and the cognitive ER strategies self-blame, catastrophizing, and rumination. The score of emotional neglect positively predicted the behavioural ER strategy ignoring. The findings were largely unexpected and partially oppose existing literature. However, different effects of emotional neglect and emotional abuse on maladaptive emotion regulation strategies were evident. This signifies the importance of understanding the relationship between emotional maltreatment and ER and the necessity for further research to investigate the differential effects of emotional neglect and emotional abuse on specific ER strategies.",

Don't judge others performance!

However, the ability to appropriately learn from positive and negative feedback is altered in individuals with social anxiety, particularly dependent on the social context. While high socially anxious individuals are more responsive to negative compared to positive feedback in non-social contexts, there is a lack of consensus on their feedback learning pattern when being under social scrutiny. Our study investigated the relationship between different levels of social anxiety and learning from positive versus negative feedback in social versus non-social contexts by using the SELF-Symbol paradigm, a probabilistic learning task. Participants with different levels of subclinical social anxiety (N = 123) had to learn the differing probabilistic accuracy contingencies of Japanese symbols through negative and positive feedback. In the standard condition, participants were alone in a room, while in the social condition, participants were observed by an examiner. The results did not yield any significant findings, indicating no difference between different levels of subclinical social anxiety in learning more accurately from positive versus negative feedback in the non-social as compared to social condition. The results are discussed with reference to the continuous nature of social anxiety symptoms and the representativeness and research design of the current study. Addressing current limitations can lead to more hopeful future research and advancements in recognising social anxiety also in non-clinical samples.","['positive versus negative feedback', 'probabilistic learning', 'reinforcement learning', 'social anxiety', 'social scrutiny', 'sub-clinical social anxiety']"

Work-life balance crafting intentions among entrepreneurs were investigated, given that a critical aspect behind maintaining a healthy work-life balance is one’s motivation to actually craft it. Two variables that may predict entrepreneurs’ intentions to craft and preserve a healthy work-life balance, growth intentions and workaholism, were thus examined in a cross-sectional study employing actual entrepreneurs (N = 172). The results of this study demonstrated that growth intentions were positively and significantly predictive of work-life balance, whereas workaholism was negatively and significantly predictive of work-life balance. The findings of this research provided supporting evidence that workaholism could lead to lower intentions of entrepreneurs to maintain a work-life balance, whereas growth intentions seem to predict a higher engagement in proactive behaviors aimed to maintain a work-life balance.","['Work-life balance crafting intentions', 'growth intentions', 'workaholism', 'entrepreneurship']"
Finding the Antisocial Ideology: Differences in Exhibiting Antisocial Behaviour and Conscientiousness Between Rightists and Leftists,"Soravia, Gianluca",['Ruthie Pliskin'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Demonstrations by both Rightists and Leftists have occurred increasingly frequently and violently over the past years. Therefore, the Researcher’s intention is to provide further insight into which fundamental differences between Rightists and Leftists explain the differences in exhibiting antisocial behaviour. Based on the literature, he hypothesises that Rightists will exhibit less antisocial behaviour against no specific target; that the personality trait conscientiousness will be higher among Rightists compared to Leftists and that higher conscientious participants will exhibit less antisocial behaviour against no specific target. Furthermore, he predicts that conscientiousness explains the relationship between Rightist exhibiting less antisocial behaviour. The Participants’ (N = 773; from the United Kingdome and USA; 380 Rightists, 393 Leftists) conscientiousness was measured using a self-report questionnaire, while antisocial behaviour was measured using the joy of destruction game (JoD). Political ideology and conscientiousness did not significantly predict exhibiting general antisocial behaviour. Furthermore, Rightists possess significantly higher conscientiousness compared to Leftists. The results indicate, that conscientiousness is not a significant mediator for the relationship between ideology and exhibiting antisocial behaviour. These findings contradict some of the prior research investigated during this study. The Researcher concludes that Rightist and Leftists might have differences in antisocial attitudes but no differences between the ideologies in terms of measuring actual antisocial behaviour.","['antisocial behaviour, joy of destruction, Rightists, Leftists, ideology, conscientiousness']"
"Impulsivity, Compulsivity & the Metacontrol State Model: Exploring Individual Differences of Cognitive Control on the Impulsivity-Compulsivity Dimension","Sibum, Talea","['Prochazkova, L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Impulsivity and compulsivity have been placed on a continuum in which impulsivity is motivated by reward sensitivity and compulsivity by avoidance. Recently, however, studies emphasised neurocognitive influences on impulsivity and compulsivity, underscoring the significance of action control. Thus, this study proposed the metacontrol state model (MSM) as an additional explanation of variance in impulsivity and compulsivity across the general population. The MSM views individuals to fall on a spectrum between cognitive flexibility and persistence, where the individual’s biases towards either side of the spectrum impacts their ability to control and inhibit action. We hypothesised that individual meta-control biases towards flexibility or persistence predict individual differences in impulsivity and compulsivity in addition to reward sensitivity and avoidance. In order to examine this relationship, 41 participants (mean age = 23.7) completed a variation of the Stroop task, the Monetary Incentive Delay task, and the UPPS-P Impulsive Behaviour Scale. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that a meta-control bias towards flexibility was positively associated with impulsivity while a persistence bias was associated with compulsivity. However, this study’s findings contradicted the traditional view, indicating an association of reward sensitivity with compulsivity and avoidance with impulsivity. The exploratory analysis, identified an interaction between reward sensitivity and the meta-control biases and a mediating effect of the MSM was suspected. Overall, this study highlights the association between individual differences in cognitive control and impulsivity and compulsivity, emphasising both the insufficiency of traditional models and the relevance of the meta-control state model.","['impulsivity', 'compulsivity', '‘metacontrol state model’', 'reward sensitivity', 'avoidance']"

Synaesthesia Training for Language Learning: Your Colours or Any Colours?,"Kettner, Nora",['Nicholas Root'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Grapheme-colour synaesthesia is a phenomenon in which presentation of letters and numbers are automatically associated with colours, and these associations stay consistent over time. Synesthetes have been found to show advantages in certain learning and memory tasks, such as language learning. Non-synesthetes have been seen to be able to create synaesthesia-like associations through repeated reinforcement between letters and colours. In this study, it was investigated if synaesthesia training in a native language could expedite the learning of a foreign alphabet. Additionally, it was hypothesised that allowing participants to choose their own letter-colour associations rather than being given predetermined associations would further improve their performance on the language learning task. To investigate this, two groups underwent synaesthesia training, with one group choosing their own associations and one group being given predetermined associations. The two groups then went through the same language learning task, where they were taught letters in a foreign language. The results showed that synaesthesia training expedited the learning of a new alphabet. The self-selecting group showed better consistency in their letter-colour associations than the group that had been pre-assigned colours. However, the learning rate of the self-selecting group was not significantly higher. To conclude, the study showed that synaesthesia training can have a positive effect on language learning, and different ways of training synaesthesia have distinctive effects on letter-colour consistency.",
The Influence of Fear of Negative Evaluation on Social Feedback Learning in Adults,"Roydes, Signe","['Sadaat, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social feedback learning can be seen as the way we learn based on either acceptance or rejection of others. The purpose of this paper is to look into how different personality characteristics such as fear of negative evaluation and self-esteem influence this social feedback learning. The reason for this is that previous research has found differing findings. Whilst some suggest that fear of negative evaluation increases both reaction time in social evaluative tasks as well as prediction accuracy from negative feedback, others suggest that this occurs automatically (due to negativity bias), and thus is not influenced by the degree of fear of negative evaluation. To investigate this, 175 adult participants (30 (17.14%) = male; 145 (82.86%) = female) were asked to fill out the BFNES questionnaire to measure fear of negative evaluation as well as the RSES questionnaire to measure self-esteem. They were subsequently asked to do the Social Judgement Paradigm, in which they would predict either positive or negative feedback from a peer. After this, they were given the actual feedback. Following this, they were asked to evaluate the peer again. If their prediction was correct, social feedback learning had occurred. Additionally, their reaction time was measured. Results showed a significant moderate negative relationship between fear of negative evaluation and self-esteem. However, the degree of fear of negative evaluation did not influence reaction time in the social judgement paradigm, nor the prediction accuracy from negative feedback. However, both people with low fear of negative evaluation and high fear of negative evaluation did exhibit social feedback learning in the prediction task. This paper provides greater insight into the influence of fear of negative evaluation on social feedback learning.","['social feedback', 'self-esteem', 'fear of negative evaluation', 'anxiety, adults']"

Peerdeman'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"It has been known for a while that expectations can shape one’s experience of pain. Numerous studies have found that the expectation of low pain results in actual lower pain experience. Furthermore, the tendency to have general optimistic life expectations has been associated with lower pain expectations, as well as with lower pain experience. On the other hand, since pain is often considered as unpleasant, disappointment seems an understandable reaction to pain that does not match one’s overly positive expectations. However, several contradicting or inconclusive results have been found with regards to the role dispositional optimism plays in the effects of pain underprediction on either pain expectations, pain experiences or disappointment. We investigated these effects to possibly find a moderating role of dispositional optimism. In this within-subject design study, healthy participants (n = 23) received cues that predicted the intensity of painful stimulations that were subsequently administered, and their expectations and experiences with regards to the pain were recorded. No significant moderation by dispositional optimism of the effects of underprediction as compared to correct prediction of pain on either pain expectations, pain experience or disappointment was found. However, other possible effects of dispositional optimisms have not yet been ruled out; further research into dispositional optimism’s exact role is necessary to be able to construct concrete advice on how to prevent harmful patient communication within health-care settings.","['Expectations, Pain, Disappointment, Dispositional Optimism']"

Parent-to-child transmission of stranger anxiety: The effect of verbal information transmission on measured and perceived heart rate,"Broschek, Henrike","['Aktar, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most prevalent anxiety disorders and can be conceptualized as the fear of scrutiny by others. SAD comes with elevated heart rate (HR) in the feared social situation. Additionally, it has been found that individuals with SAD perceive their HR to be higher. Therefore, high perceived HR serves as an indicator of how much anxiety an individual is experiencing. The development of SAD is impacted by verbal transmission of fears. This presents the idea that exposure to verbal threat information about a stimulus influences the child’s development of fears. Especially parents and their level of anxiety play a significant role in this pathway. The present study investigates the verbal transmission pathway by looking at the influence of parental transmission of safety and threat information on children’s HR and their perception of HR. Primary caregivers were instructed to transmit verbal or threat information to their child (N = 64, Mage = 11.67) regarding two strangers that the child faced in the lab. Fear response to the strangers was measured with HR and a visual analogous scale indicating the perceived HR. Parents also reported their own social anxiety, which was included as a moderating variable. No significant influence of the transmission of verbal information was found on HR and perceived HR. Additionally, parental social anxiety did not act as a significant moderator when it comes to the transmission of verbal information on HR or perceived HR. The lack of significant findings underlines the need to further investigate the influence of parental verbal transmission of information on child’s HR and perceived HR and the moderating role of parental social anxiety in these pathways.",

However, one area that has not been investigated sufficiently yet is the effect such sonification systems have on a person’s motivation to engage in and persevere with them. Since the average rehabilitation time for neurological motor impairments is long and arduous, methods that are perceived as fun can make the rehabilitation process more pleasant while simultaneously hastening it. We exposed participants to videos of two different sonification systems (musically informed sonification and parameter mapping) and had them rate these videos on motivational power and pleasantness. We then asked them to complete Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (GMSI), as we expected to find a positive predictive power of general musical sophistication for willingness to explore either sonification system. Our results show that participants generally rated the sound of musically informed sonification as significantly more pleasant than that of parameter mapping. Although we did not find a direct relationship between the willingness to explore either sonification system and general musical sophistication, subsequent exploratory analyses revealed a relationship between two subscales of the GMSI and willingness to explore the musically informed sonification system. An additional exploratory t-test revealed a better sound-movement correspondence of the parameter mapping over the musically informed sonification. Our results provide new insights into the perceived pleasantness, motivation, and accuracy of sonification systems, making an essential contribution to the development of individualized adaptations of motor re-(learning) forms.","['auditory sonification systems, musically informed sonification, parameter mapping, Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index, motivation']"

Acquired social fear in children can manifest itself in indices of fear, such as reported fear beliefs and observed avoidance behavior. This thesis focused on how parental verbal expressions of threat and safety influences the fear beliefs and avoidance behavior of children towards strangers (N = 72, Mage = 11.67 years, 41 girls). The parent was instructed to describe two strangers (who were unaware of their condition) with threat or safety statements. The children then performed three social tasks with each stranger. During these tasks their avoidant behavior was observed and after the tasks fear beliefs for each stranger were reported. Parents were also asked to report on symptoms of SAD to investigate whether this has a moderating role in child social fears. Results show that children reported significantly more fear beliefs for the stranger paired with threat information than the stranger with safety information, but there were no significant differences in avoidance behaviors between the two strangers. In addition, the findings did not reveal a moderating role of parental SAD. We conclude that verbal expressions of threat contribute to more fear beliefs towards strangers, but these fear beliefs are not translated into more avoidance behavior. The findings reveal the need for more research on avoidance in social situations and the role of parent SAD in a clinical sample.",

A cross-sectional online survey study (n = 200) was conducted to investigate these effects using a combination of questionnaires and open questions. Contrary to expectations, avoidance was not found to be connected to psychological addiction to mystical experiences. However, sensation-seeking proved to relate to psychological addiction and was correlated with an increased likelihood of using psychedelics in the future. The relationship between absorption and psychological addiction was found to be mediated by the intention to confront difficult emotions. The findings indicate that higher scores on absorption increase the likelihood of using psychedelics with the intention to confront negative emotions. In contrast to expectations, the intention to confront one's emotions was found to increase the likelihood of using psychedelics in the future, therefore making the person more likely to become psychologically addicted to mystical experiences. Exploratory analysis revealed that the perceived importance of a facilitator in a non-clinical setting and the importance of experiencing ego death were not connected to psychological addiction and the future likelihood of using psychedelics. Five intentions for psychedelic use were found to be connected to an increased likelihood of psychological addiction to mystical experiences. Additionally, alternative explanations for hypotheses and new research are suggested.","['Psychedelics', 'Psychological addiction', 'Avoidance', 'Absorption', 'Sensation-seeking', 'Intention for psychedelic use']"

Predicting challenging psychedelic experiences: What is in and out of our control when predicting challenging psychedelic experiences,"Vilūnaitė, Ūla",['Huseyin Beykoylu'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The current research on the challenging aspect of psychedelics, or the so-called ‘bad trips’ remains limited. Therefore, this paper is going to examine different predictors of the challenging psychedelic experience. It was hypothesized that independent variables such as 1. Intention to escape difficult emotions, 2. Vulnerable narcissism, with possible mediation of experiential avoidance, 3. Cognitive emotion regulation tactics, with possible mediation of self-esteem, will have an effect on the dependent variable Challenging Experience. After conducting a retrospective online survey of 110 healthy adults, it was found that the intention to escape difficult emotions has an effect on challenging experiences. While vulnerable narcissism has an influence on the challenging experience, it is not mediated by experiential avoidance. The results also showed that cognitive emotion regulation tactics (except for the factor “Putting into perspective”) do not have a relationship with challenging experiences and are not mediated by self-esteem. Exploratory hypotheses were formed about a correlation between independent variables set, setting, and intentions, and the intensity of a challenging experience. Moreover, it was hypothesized that challenging experiences can be helpful to form insights about life, that can later be implemented and improve further wellbeing, and that these insights will have correlations with set, setting, and intentions. It was found that insight gained is mostly correlated with intentions. This study sheds light on factors that can be in and out of the control of the person before a psychedelic experience, and how these factors influence whether the experience becomes challenging.","['Challenging psychedelic experience', 'psychedelics']"
“Is it Healthy to be a Lone Wolf?” - A Correlational Analysis of the Relationship between Social Disconnectedness and Suicidal Ideation Moderated by Gender,"Wilhelmy, Jan-David","['Bahamondes-Álvarez, R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Suicidal ideation is a highly debated mental health problem in the scientific literature. Different models have been developed to explain its origin; however, most do not acknowledge social factors as possible determinants even in face of the growing body of literature highlighting their importance. One of them being social disconnectedness and the other gender, with an implication of a moderating effect of gender on the relationship between social disconnectedness and suicidal ideation, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of social disconnectedness and suicidal ideation, and gender as a moderator. An Internet based survey was provided to students of Leiden University that included the Suicidal Ideation Scale, the Social Connectedness Scale – Revised, and a record of the gender identity of the respondents. To investigate the relationship between social disconnectedness and suicidal ideation, a correlational analysis was performed which found a significant negative correlation with r(121) = -.428, p < .001, indicating a positive relationship between suicidal ideation and social disconnectedness. To test whether gender has a moderating effect on this relationship, a hierarchical regression analysis was performed which found no significant moderating effect with B = -26.45, t(119) = -5.39, p > .001. Therefore, the relationship between social disconnectedness and suicidal ideation held in this student sample, but the moderation effect of gender could not be supported. Limitation to the study’s generalizability may explain these findings. As a relationship between social disconnectedness and suicidal ideation was found in students, it is advised that university officials use this knowledge for pre- and intervention programmes. Altogether, the results support the proposal of social factors as determinants for mental health problems including suicidal ideation.","['Social disconnectedness, social connectedness, suicidal ideation, gender, gender identity, social determinants, mental health, social support.']"

Insecure Attachment & Social Feedback Processing: An Analysis of Midfrontal Theta Power an Learning Biases About the Self,"Rönnau, Charlotte","['van der Molen, M.J.W.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The formation of attachment styles and internal working models of relationships is crucial in development, as it influences social connectedness during the life course. Attachment theory proposes that people differ in their reactions to relational threats based on attachment orientation. Whereas avoidant attachment is associated with minor discomfort following social rejection, anxiously attached individuals display heightened emotional reactivity. To test whether individual differences also manifest in distinct neural activity and biased adaptations of one's self-view following social feedback, 95 participants (mean age = 20.2 years) performed a speech task with subsequent self-evaluation and feedback provision. After receiving feedback from a panel of judges, participants were asked to indicate how they felt about themselves. During the procedure, EEG was used to measure neural activity. Feedback-related midfrontal theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations were assessed with the assumption of increased theta power for anxiously but not avoidantly attached individuals following unexpected negative feedback. Results suggested the absence of attachment-related differences in theta power during social feedback processing. Additionally, computational modeling was used to examine how feedback from the judges influenced participants' feeling state over time, based on attachment orientation. Results indicated that neither predominantly anxiously participants nor those who were primarily avoidantly attached were influenced more strongly by positive or negative feedback. Together, this study offers a starting point to study neural underpinnings of the attachment system and learning biases during social feedback processing, thereby providing a crucial contribution to the attachment literature.","['affective updating, attachment theory, electroencephalography, integrative control-system model, midfrontal theta oscillations, social evaluative feedback']"

The research was conducted through a cross-sectional survey with members of the general public, with participants (n=143) being recruited through Academic Prolific. A series of regression analyses were performed. First, a direct and positive relation of affinity with the organization and identification with all humanity on likeability of the organization was found. A direct and positive relation was also found for identification with all humanity on sympathy. Lastly, a direct and positive relation was found for likeability of the organization on willingness to donate. The mediation regression analysis supported the hypothesis that affinity with an organization related indirectly and positively to willingness to donate through the likeability of the nonprofit organization. Mediation analysis also showed support for identification with all humanity having an indirect and positive relation to willingness to donate through likeability of the organization. The moderation regression analysis did not support the assumption that the effect of affinity with the organization on likeability of the organization is strengthened by identification with all humanity. Consequently, a moderated-mediation was also not supported. This research brings new theoretical contributions and provides practical implications, which are discussed at the end of the article along with the limitations of the study.","['Identification with all Humanity (IWAH), Willingness-to-donate, affinity, nonprofit organizations, sympathy.']"

Individual Differences in Intolerance of Uncertainty and Their Effects on Novelty-Facilitated Fear Extinction,"Kramers, Aishah","['Schomaker, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The objective of the present study was to gain a better understanding on the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and novelty-facilitated fear extinction (NFE). Previous research found that IU is associated with impaired extinction learning and a higher relapse rate, but not within the context of NFE. Even so, it remains unclear under which conditions and to what extent IU may influence NFE. To investigate this further, the data of 31 participants was collected in a within-subjects design. During the conditioning phase, participants were shown images of negative and neutral valence paired with neutral sounds, followed by the extinction phase where the previously conditioned sounds were paired with novel or familiar images. Both phases included control conditions where no images were presented. All participants returned to the experiment room within 18 to 36 hours for the post-extinction phase, where they heard the sounds again but without any visual stimuli. Pupil dilation was measured as an indication of arousal and IU was measured with the IU scale. The results indicate that the novelty did assist individuals with high IU in the extinction phase. The post-extinction phase showed that individuals with high IU had smaller pupil sizes when they heard sounds paired to a familiar image. Pupil sizes were, however, largest in the control conditions. The implications of NFE may have far-reaching consequences for the development of clinical treatment methods. Future research should study the effects of NFE outside laboratory settings, and explore the various ways individual characteristics might be of influence.","['lassical conditioning, extinction, novelty, novelty-facilitated extinction, intolerance of uncertainty']"

However, studies applying this model to SMI populations and investigating the interaction of protective factors listed above are yet scarce. This study, following a strengths-based approach, was focused on intrinsic religiosity and psychological well-being in SMI individuals and investigated whether the relationship between the two was mediated by identity achievement and identity affirmation while having gender as a covariate. An online survey was conducted where the participants were sexual minority adults (N = 241). The hypothesis was investigated using the fourth model of Hayes Mediation and Moderation Analysis Models. Additionally, Spearman’s correlation coefficients were calculated for each variable. The model yielded insignificant results for both identity achievement (b (SE) = .- 05 (.09), 95% CI: [-.26, .12]) and identity affirmation (b (SE): .03 (.18), 95% CI: [-.40, .34]) as mediators. The total effect of intrinsic religiosity on psychological well-being was also insignificant with b (SE) = -.57 (.57), t = -1.01, p = .31, 95% CI: [-1.69, .55]. The results of the study indicated that the proposed mediation model was insignificant and that the effect of intrinsic religiosity on psychological wellbeing is not mediated by identity achievement or affirmation. Future studies investigating this relationship should aim to obtain a sample with more variance in intrinsic religiosity. It is also recommended to integrate other protective factors into this model such as parental acceptance to explore the interactions in depth.","['LGBT', 'SMI', 'psychological wellbeing', 'religiosity', 'identity affirmation', 'identity achievement']"
Attachment Style and Resilience in Sexual Minority Adults: Is The Relationship Moderated by Internalized Homonegativity?,"Stevanovich, Sven",['Aischa Reinken'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Sexual minority individuals (SMI) are more susceptible to psychopathology than heterosexuals. Internalized homonegativity (IH) and attachment style (AS) are connected, and secure AS and resilience are positively correlated. IH was found to be a risk factor and an insecure AS is a risk factor for IH, whereas a secure AS would be a protective factor. The present study investigates whether the relationship between attachment style and resilience is moderated by internalized homonegativity in SMI. Data was collected via an online survey using self-report measures from SMI adults (n = 241) that measured the variables of AS, IH, and resilience. The following hypotheses were tested using multiple regression analyses: (H1) individuals with a positive self-model and positive other-model (overall secure attachment) in combination with low levels of internalized homonegativity predict resilience, (H2) the relationship between AS was moderated by IH. The results showed no statistically significant effect of IH and MOS in any model, meaning that (H1) is rejected. Furthermore, no interactions were significant, meaning no moderation effect, and therefore, (H2) is rejected. There were no changes in significance when Model 1, 2, and 4 were tested with and without outliers. However, there were significant changes when Model 3 was tested without outliers; from significant to nonsignificant. The author concludes that this is a good model of resilience but the low variance of the sample cannot show that the model was a good fit. Further research should focus on protective factors and their influence on psychological wellbeing in SMI populations.","['Attachment style', 'Internalized homonegativity', 'Resilience', 'Sexual minority individuals']"

This had an effect on infected individuals, as well as those who quarantined and healthy individuals. Maladaptive coping has been shown to affect pandemic-onset depressive symptoms. The research on how these differ between infected, quarantined and heathy individuals is limited. This cross-sectional online questionnaire (n=150) aimed to find out whether there is an association between these factors. The present study investigated whether healthy, quarantined, and infected populations, heron called COVID-Status groups, experienced differences in pandemic onset depression. Furthermore, it investigated whether maladaptive coping mechanisms are associated with pandemic onset depressive symptoms within healthy, quarantined, and infected populations. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-Depression), and coping was measured with the Pandemic Coping Scale (PCS). Both the PHQ-9 and the HADS-Depression have yielded no significant association between depressive symptoms and the COVID-Status groups. While accounting for coping, the association between depressive symptoms and the COVID-Status groups was also insignificant in both depression tests. However, coping was significantly adjusting the association between depressive symptoms and COVID-Status groups in both the PHQ-9 (F(1,149)=4.82, p=.030) and the HADS-Depression (F(1,149)=11.95, p=.001). Furthermore, more adaptive coping was associated with fewer depressive symptoms for both depression measures (B=-.16). The findings are limited by the small sample size, as well as the cross-sectional design. Future studies should create bigger samples and use longitudinal data.",

Research investigating differences in pandemic-onset depressive symptoms in these population groups is limited. Few studies have been conducted concerning changes in mental health between international and Dutch/domestic students. Due to the limited and mixed results, this is an important addition to existing literature. Through a cross-sectional online questionnaire (N = 150) this study aims to explore differences in pandemic-onset depressive symptoms associated to “Covid status” and being an international or domestic student. Participants indicated their nationality and self-reported depressive symptoms through HADS and PHQ questionnaires. The hypothesis was that international students have experienced more frequent and severe depressive symptoms in comparison to Dutch students. A cumulative trend was also assumed to be linked to an individual’s “Covid status”, with the healthy group being the least impacted and the isolated group being the most. No association was found between “Covid status” and depressive symptoms. However, a significant difference was discovered between international and domestic students in the HADS questionnaire (p = .027). Limiting factors include the non-experimental nature of the study (i.e., no control groups) and variable causality was not controlled for. Participants were not restricted to the Netherlands causing possible under or overrepresentation of the specific Dutch or international groups. To avoid this, future studies can limit participation to one country and include control for the results.","['Covid Status', 'Depressive Symptoms', 'Domestic Student', 'International Student']"

To date, research findings suggest that heightened emotionality can greatly impact our behaviour towards outgroups, exposing our automatic biases and affecting our cognitive abilities. It has been suggested that cultural diversity awareness moderates this, by elevating acceptance and openness to experience. This research aims to investigate the relationship between emotionally charged tweets, race, and friendliness judgements, and whether cultural diversity awareness predicts lower racial bias. The study was conducted online, with 53 Caucasian female participants completing the experimental task, in which 240 trials of positive/neutral/negative emotionally charged Tweets were shown followed by a Black or White face. Participants were requested to provide a friendliness judgement on a rating scale of 1-5 while the face was displayed. Subsequently, participants were directed to a cultural diversity awareness questionnaire. Results revealed that individually, race and emotionality do have an effect on friendliness judgements, with Black faces being perceived as more friendly than White faces (which contrasted the original hypothesis), and with positive tweets leading to higher friendliness scoring. However, no significant effect was found for the interaction of these two variables. Cultural diversity awareness was found to correlate negatively with racial bias. Future directions on how to further investigate the relationship between the variables are discussed in relation to the findings.","['Racial Bias', 'Emotionality', 'Friendliness Judgements', 'Cultural Diversity Awareness', 'Twitter', 'Online Spaces']"

This study focuses on the affective states related to BAS, namely happiness and excitement. Furthermore, this study investigates whether appetitive (rewarding) tasks affect differently these two states. Thirty-six participants, mostly students of Leiden University, were recruited for this study. First, the study used linear regression to measure how self-reported BAS scores affect the change in happiness and excitement after an appetitive virtual reality task. Next, this study compared the difference in happiness and excitement after the virtual reality task with paired-samples t-tests. The results suggest that BAS scores did not have an association with the change in excitement or happiness. Excitement was however found to be significantly higher than happiness after the VR task. Based on these findings, there is support for excitement being more influenced by BAS than happiness, assuming that the virtual reality task was appetitive.",
Hypomanic personality - Does it predict performance on goal-directed tasks?,"Lehtonen, Venla Wilhelmiina","['Dr. Manja Koenders', 'Dr. Roy De Klein']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study considers hypomania and its effect on performance on goal-directed excitement-inducing tasks. Hypomania is defined as a condition of abnormally elevated mood, increased risk-taking, impulsivity, and heightened reward sensitivity. Hypomania and hypomanic personality characteristics can occur in clinically healthy individuals and thus, is not necessarily restricted to people with a diagnosis of bipolar (II) disorder. This study uses a self-questionnaire (Hypomanic Personality Scale-Short Form; HPS-SF) to assess vulnerability to hypomania in a non-clinical sample. We are particularly interested in whether a higher score on the hypomania questionnaire predicts faster performance on a number of goal-directed, excitement-provoking behavioral tasks in which there is a chance of reward. Available studies suggest that hypomania-prone individuals have a preference for immediate rewards as well as strong goal orientation and higher levels of impulsivity. Based on these notions, this study expects high-scoring individuals to perform these types of behavioral tasks faster than low-scoring individuals. With the use of linear regression analysis, it was found, contrary to the expectations, that a person's score on the HPS-SF did not predict faster task performance. Further research exploring the topic on a clinical sample may provide new insights and better understanding.","['hypomania, bipolar disorder, reward sensitivity, task performance, HPS-SF, regression analysis']"

Individuals with depression and low self-esteem might have difficulty engaging in social feedback learning. Existing literature confirms that depression and a low self-esteem play a role in social dysfunction and can inhibit social feedback learning. In the present study we aimed to investigate the effects of depression and self-esteem on social feedback learning by means of the SELF-profile paradigm task by Van der Molen et al. (2017). The goal was to explore how the presence of depression as well as low self-esteem would affect the ability to learn from social feedback after having received positive feedback from pre-calculated ratings of peers. In the context of depression and self-esteem, social feedback learning was measured by means of reaction time scores and pre- and post-prediction responses. Depression and self-esteem were measured with the Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) measures for depression and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES) for self-esteem. Insignificance was shown when testing the hypotheses, leading to the conclusion that an interaction between the concepts could be in the foreground rather than predictions. Concepts such as abuse and bullying could be considered in future research when dealing with social feedback learning.","['Depression, self-esteem, social dysfunction, social feedback learning, bias']"

I looked specifically if childhood poverty would have negative behavioral effects, in this case aggression towards outgroups, in adulthood. Our sample consisted of 802 members from the United Kingdom and the United States of America, 362 of which reported having experienced poverty during their childhood. They played the Joy of Destruction game, which measured aggression towards an outgroup and then filled in an online questionnaire which include current socioeconomic information and experiences of childhood poverty. The results indicated that people who experienced childhood poverty displayed more aggression towards members of an outgroup. This result contributes to the existing literature that having adverse experiences during childhood will have a negative effect on one’s behavior in adulthood.","['Childhood poverty', 'Aggression', 'Adulthood']"

Het niet-geschreven strategiegebruik neemt toe, terwijl dit in de rekenmethodes niet gestimuleerd wordt. In vergelijking met geschreven strategieën, zijn niet-geschreven strategieën minder accuraat en leiden deze tot meer fouten. Voor leerkrachten is het belangrijk om inzicht te hebben in patronen in strategiekeuze ten aanzien van bepaalde groepen, om zo optimale begeleiding te kunnen bieden. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te achterhalen of de factoren rekenvaardigheid en zelfvertrouwen voorspellende effecten hebben op de strategiekeuze bij deelopgaven bij groep 8-leerlingen in het reguliere Nederlandse basisonderwijs. De data werden verkregen vanuit het Peilingsonderzoek Rekenen-Wiskunde bij schoolverlaters in het (speciaal) basisonderwijs 2019 (N = 2134). Via binaire logistische regressies is gekeken of de mate van rekenvaardigheid effect heeft op strategiekeuzes. Met een moderatie is gekeken of de factor zelfvertrouwen intervenieert in deze mogelijke effecten. Op basis van de resultaten lijken er aanwijzingen te zijn dat, gecontroleerd voor geslacht, sterkere rekenaars meer geschreven en zwakkere rekenaars meer niet-geschreven strategiegebruik toepassen. Ook kiezen jongens vaker voor niet-geschreven strategieën dan meisjes. In het onderzoek zijn geen (modererende) effecten van zelfvertrouwen gevonden. Ondanks het feit dat er weinig significante effecten gevonden zijn, laat dit onderzoek de tendens zien dat niet-geschreven strategiegebruik relatief vaker gekozen wordt door zwakkere rekenaars, jongens en sterkere rekenaars die veel hoofdrekenen. De aanbeveling is dan ook dat bij deze groepen leerlingen het geschreven strategiegebruik meer gestimuleerd wordt door leerkrachten. Eventueel vervolgonderzoek zou zich kunnen richten op losstaande effecten van rekenvaardigheid, invloeden van gebruikte rekenmethodes en strategiegebruik bij leerlingen in het speciaal basisonderwijs.","['Strategiegebruik, Rekenvaardigheid, Zelfvertrouwen, Geslacht, Deelbewerkingen']"
No significant effect of transcranial vagus nerve stimulation on pupil size: A replication study,"Brama, Steffanie","['Lloyd, B.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Replication is an essential concept in psychological science. It can give rise to new insights into promising scientific developments, ensuring the quality and reliability of scientific research. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) showed that it can be deployed as an alternative treatment for patients suffering from drug-resistant depression and epilepsy. However, VNS is highly invasive and comes with great risks. The non-invasive transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) may induce this similar effect, by targeting the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic pathway (LC-NA). In the current study, we replicated the paper by Sharon et al. (2021), investigating the effect of tVNS on human pupil dilation. Throughout the experiment, the left ear of each participant was stimulated with the tVNS device, using short pulses of 3.4 seconds. Furthermore, pupillometry was deployed as a measure for pupil dilation. The outcome of this replication was in contrast with Sharon et al. (2021), as the results showed no significant difference between the tVNS and the sham condition. The final results might have been affected by the small sample size, the different adoption of materials, and an unequal ratio of males and females among participants. Future research should use a larger sample size, replicate more consistently and systematically, and adopt an equal ratio of gender. More research is necessary to establish reliable parameters for discoveries on the probable therapeutic effects of tVNS.",
Boys vs. Girls: A Meta-Analysis Investigating Sex Differences in Self-Regulation and EmotionRegulation,"Fiorentino, Chiara","['Wierenga, L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The aim of this quantitative meta-analysis was to investigate sex differences in self-regulation and emotion regulation. The reason for investigating these variables is due to the fact that there is a gender gap in academic achievements (Driessen & Van Langen, 2013). Self-regulation is related to academic achievements because it is the ability to regulate one’s behavior according to the demands of one’s environment (Perry et al., 2017). Emotion regulation is also examined in this meta-analysis because previous research has suggested that the way one approaches their academics in terms of emotions can determine how one self-regulates, thus possibly affecting academic achievements (Boekaerts, 2011). The meta-analysis was conducted by collecting all relevant studies from the past 10 years through two separate literature searches for both self and emotion-regulation in the database Web of Science. Participants were ages four to 25. Results showed a significant difference between boys and girls in self-regulation and emotion-regulation. Boys were found to be at a disadvantage for both self and emotion-regulation. Considering that there are significant sex differences in self and emotion-regulation, these factors could be contributing to the current gender gap in education. However, no causal relationships could be established in this meta-analysis.",
Sex difference in Self-regulation and Risk Taking of children and youth: A meta-analysis,"Schwäricke, Kira","['Wierenga, L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Self-regulation and risk taking are among the most thoroughly researched cognitive variables that show sex differences in school settings. For the past decades, girls have been academically outperforming their male counterparts on a global scale. Differences in self-regulation and risk taking could explain the gap in school performance between boys and girls. Thorough research into sex differences in these variables may provide insight that could minimize this gap in school performance. This meta-analysis explores the link between sex differences in school performance and sex differences in self-regulation and risk taking. Additionally, the development of self-regulation and risk taking was examined for each sex. This meta-analysis compares the results of 22 articles for self-regulation and 19 articles for risk taking. Results showed that there is a significant difference in self-regulation with SMD= -.11, 95%-CI [-0.19, -0.03] p = 0.006, and in risk taking with SMD= .19, 95%-CI [0.09, 0.30] p < 0.000. A significant maturation effect was found for risk taking, with SMD= .19, 95%-CI= [0.09, 0.30], p < .000, but not for self-regulation.","['child, adolescent, youth, risk taking, risk seeking, self-regulation, self-discipline, sex, gender']"
Closing the gap: On socioeconomic status influencing the results of educational assessment methods,"Wulff, Remond","['Vandenbroucke, A.R.E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"As children start school, more and more emphasis is placed on their academic performance, their cognitive capabilities, and their intelligence. Current forms of intelligence testing – static testing and assessment – have been heavily scrutinised for being biased due to for example the influence of socioeconomic status (SES), leading to unequal educational outcomes. Therefore, different forms of testing – dynamic testing and assessment – are being investigated, with this study focusing on a new form of the Dynamic Screener (DS). This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the DS to increase children’s test performance. A second aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of SES for learning potential and DS outcomes. Participants included 52 children (mean age = 13.14) in the first year of secondary school. The study employed a single-session experimental test-training-test design. Half of the children (n= 27) received a graduated prompts training between the pre-test and post-test, while the other half (n= 25) were the control group and did not receive the training. Five different tests were administered, including a test for working memory, mathematics, language, planning, and inductive reasoning. No significant results were found for trained participants’ performance in comparison with the control group on any of the subtests. Furthermore, no significant difference was found for the predictive value of SES for learning potential, nor for results on pre- versus post-test for the training group. Overall, no definitive conclusions on the effectiveness of the DS, nor on the predictive value of SES for learning potential and DS outcomes, can be drawn from the current study. Future research is needed to determine whether these results are due to the small sample size or are inherent to the DS.","['Dynamic Testing', 'Dynamic Screener', 'Dynamic Assessment', 'Static Testing', 'Static Assessment', 'SES', 'Socioeconomic status', 'educational assessment', 'cognitive capabilities', 'intelligence', 'intelligence testing']"

Does anxiety mediate the association between attentional bias and pruritus?,"Patera, Elissavet","['Becker, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Itch or pruritus attains an innate defence mechanism of the body, serving as an alarm response to damage or harm. A selection of past research indicated that individuals experiencing pruritic symptoms due to a dermatological condition, express selective attentional focus (attentional bias) towards itch. The alarming effect of a pruritic sensation, is potentially pursued by a fear response, which metamorphizes into anxiety. It is often suggested that heightened anxiety follows selective attention to the intimidating, theoretically provoking, stimulus. Anxiety aggravates itch, resulting in a vicious cycle, feasibly by potentiating itch-related anxiety. The rationale of this research lies in unravelling the impact of the psychopathological trait of anxiety, behind both attentional bias and pruritus. It is hypothesized that patients with chronic itch who experience heightened anxiety, report more attentional bias towards itch-related stimuli compared to less anxious patients with chronic itch. The sample consisted of 5 participants with chronic itch symptomatology that were assessed on a spatial cueing task. The statistical assessment was comprised of a mediation analysis. Our results were not in line with our hypothesis. In other words, a non-significant relationship was found between attentional bias and itch, attentional bias, and anxiety as well amongst anxiety and itch. Furthermore, we conclude that either our results do in fact reflect the reality of an inexistent relationship or that specific parameters of the methodology resulted in non-significant findings. Future implications are directed towards a more appropriate population sample and the careful consideration of exclusion criteria from the study.","['Pruritus, itch, attentional bias, anxiety, attentional bias towards itch, mediation']"

Op basis van bestaande literatuur werd deze relatie wel verwacht. Er is geen mediërende rol van boosheid gevonden op de relatie tussen morele overtuiging en sociale afstand. Ook deze rol werd verwacht naar aanleiding van eerder onderzoek. Er is daarentegen wel een mediërende rol van attitudesterkte gevonden op de relatie tussen morele overtuiging en sociale afstand.

De therapeutische relatie in de interculturele context: De invloed van een cultuurverschil in de dimensie individualisme op de therapeutische relatie,"Brinkmann, Eva","['Henkelmann, J.R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Een belangrijk aspect van psychotherapie, die de resultaten ervan kan beïnvloeden, is de therapeutische relatie. Door een toename in multiculturalisme, vindt psychotherapie vaker in een interculturele context plaats en kunnen er complicaties ontstaan. Dit exploratieve onderzoek kijkt naar de interculturele therapeutische relatie. Er wordt specifiek onderzoek gedaan naar de invloed van een cultuurverschil in individualisme en collectivisme, tussen de cliënt en therapeut, op zowel de kwaliteit van de algehele relatie en ‘de werkwijzeconsensus’. De werkwijzeconsensus is de overeenkomstigheid tussen de cliënt en therapeut in de gewenste werkwijze tijdens de therapie. Therapeutische relaties met en zonder cultuurverschillen zijn met elkaar vergeleken. Hiervoor is een culturele afstand index bedacht, die het culturele verschil tussen cliënt en therapeut kwantificeerbaar maakt. Dit is onderzocht middels een (Engelstalige) vragenlijst bestaande uit: de cliëntversie van de ‘California Psychotherapy Alliance Scales’ (CALPAS-P) aangevuld met eigen vragen. De steekproef bestaat uit 101 respondenten tussen de 18 en 65 jaar, die ambulante zorg in de vorm van psychotherapie gebruik(t)en, en de benodigde vragen beantwoord hebben. De resultaten gaan tegen de verwachtingen in en geen van de nulhypothesen konden verworpen worden. Er zijn dan ook op basis van dit onderzoek geen duidelijke conclusies te trekken over de invloed van culturele afstand (in de dimensie individualisme-collectivisme), op zowel de kwaliteit van de therapeutische relatie als op de werkwijzeconsensus.

Ondanks de al hoge cijfers van mensen met een depressie, is het werkelijke aantal met depressieve klachten nog vele malen hoger. Een bruikbare interventie hiertegen zou beweging kunnen zijn. Volgens eerder onderzoek zijn factoren die mogelijk nog meespelen zelfvertrouwen en type sport. Vandaar dat in deze studie door middel van vragenlijsten onderzocht werd of de relatie tussen fysieke activiteit en depressieve klachten gemodereerd kan worden door zelfvertrouwen. Ook de relatie tussen type sport en depressieve klachten werd onderzocht. Respondenten (n = 139) tussen de 16 en 61 jaar werden gevraagd naar hun fysieke activiteit (GPAQ), depressieve klachten (PHQ-9) en zelfvertrouwen (SES). Twee multipele regressies zijn uitgevoerd, waarbij er geen significant interactie-effect van zelfvertrouwen op de relatie tussen fysieke activiteit en depressieve klachten werd gevonden (p = .780). Ook is er geen significant verschil gevonden van type sport op depressieve klachten (p = .464). Het effect dat wel significant was, is de relatie van zelfvertrouwen en depressieve klachten (p < .001), wat suggereert dat zelfvertrouwen een belangrijke voorspeller van depressieve klachten is. Een verklaring voor het verkrijgen van niet significante effecten is de selecte steekproef, waardoor de verkregen data verstoord werd. De gevonden resultaten kunnen om deze reden niet gegeneraliseerd worden en moeten bescheiden geïnterpreteerd worden. Vervolgonderzoek kan zich richten op longitudinaal onderzoek op de relatie tussen fysieke activiteit en depressieve klachten met bijbehorende factoren en zal de limitaties van huidig onderzoek moeten corrigeren.","['Fysieke activiteit', 'depressieve klachten', 'zelfvertrouwen', 'type sport']"

Bij een multiverse analyse worden de mogelijke combinaties van keuzes, die gemaakt kunnen worden binnen onderzoek, geanalyseerd. In dit bachelorproject is er een reproductie en multiverse analyse gedaan van het onderzoek van Weissman et al. (2020). Hierbij wordt de betrouwbaarheid en de robuustheid van het resultaat onderzocht. Weissman et al. (2020) hebben een relatie gevonden tussen emotioneel bewustzijn en psychopathologie. Bij de reproductie wordt er een ander resultaat gevonden dan Weissman et al. (2020). Dit resultaat laat verder wel een relatie zien tussen emotioneel bewustzijn en psychopathologie. Het onderzoek is niet volledig reproduceerbaar door het gebrek aan transparantie en beschikbare data. De multiverse analyse laat zien dat emotioneel bewustzijn een robuuste voorspeller is voor algemene symptomen van psychopathologie. Echter, blijkt er dat emotioneel bewustzijn wel gecorreleerd is met internaliserende psychopathologie, maar niet met externaliserende psychopathologie. Uit dit bachelorproject blijkt dat transparantie van belang is voor de betrouwbaarheid van onderzoek en de reproduceerbaarheid. Hierbij gaat het over transparantie over de analyses die zijn uitgevoerd en het beschikbaar stellen van ruwe data en syntax. Verder blijkt dat een multiverse analyse inzicht kan geven over de robuustheid van resultaat, maar hierbij ook het theoretisch kader kan verfijnen voor toekomstig onderzoek.","['multiverse analyse', 'reproductie', 'betrouwbaarheid', 'transparantie', 'emotioneel bewustzijn', 'psychopathologie']"

This led to an increased interest in estimating the rate of replication studies in the field. We explore an alternative approach to estimating the prevalence of replication studies. We constructed a code that counts the occurrences of search terms. To determine which search terms are useful for estimating a replication rate, we used this code on a dataset of 325 publications that were manually coded on whether they were considered replication studies. We were also able to use the word counts to investigate the replication rates per search term, and the role that the frequency of these search terms plays. We found that looking at the frequency of search terms does not help finding replication studies more accurately. However, a single occurrence of a reference, combined with the term “replicat*”, does give a more accurate search when looking for replication studies. In addition, the terms “note”, “reapprais*”, “revis*” and “verif*” seem beneficial to include in a search profile, but our sample data for these terms was too small to be conclusive. To accommodate future research on this topic, we present a search profile and provide a code that can be used in R to determine which search terms can contribute to finding replication studies accurately.",
Do Clothing and Facial Expressions Moderate The Relationship Between Personality Traits and Attractiveness Judgments,"Ozturk, Ada","['Samara, I.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Physically attractive people are rated more favorably by others and even have higher personal and professional life success. It has been shown that clothing style and smiling influence attractiveness in previous research; but how about our personality traits? Crucially, our personality traits might also influence our judgements about attractiveness. Our personality traits, especially extraversion and agreeableness, may be effective on whom we find attractive and may explain the reason behind it. The present thesis aims to examine whether clothing and the facial expressions of the other person can moderate the relationship between our personality traits and judgements about attractiveness. It also aims to bring insight into when we feel ourselves attractive, and the role of the other person in the interaction. Thirty-one (N = 31) participants were recruited to examine the moderation. Participants were presented with videos of models, in two different conditions for clothing: provocatively dressed vs. conservatively and three different conditions for the facial expressions; smile, coy smile vs. neutral expression. Participants were then asked to rate the attractiveness of the person that they saw in the video and how attractive that person would find them in return. They are then asked to fill out questionnaires including the MINI-IPIP to measure extraversion and agreeableness. Moderation analyses showed that neither the clothing type, nor the facial expression of the people they are interacting with did not moderate the relationship between the personality traits and ratings of attractiveness. These findings are explained in the context of moderation models, and future research is discussed.","['clothing', 'facial expressions', 'personality traits', 'extraversion', 'agreeableness', 'attractiveness']"

The purpose of this paper is to find out what the influence of the corona pandemic is on the mental health of the youth in comparison with adults and if mindfulness helps. Methods. A questionnaire has been administered before the pandemic in 2018, during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 and after the pandemic in 2022. The questionnaire, that contains the SF-36 and the FIT-18, has been administered to the youth and adolescents. The data has been used to perform ANOVA’s and regressions analyses to research the hypotheses. Results. The mental health of the youth was lower during than before the pandemic and was lower during the pandemic than in comparison with the adults. After the pandemic the youth recovered faster. The mental health was not lower for people with a low mindfulness in comparison with high mindfulness, also not for the youth. Mental health was not lower during the pandemic in comparison with after the pandemic, also not for people with low mindfulness. Discussion. The youth had it mentally heavier than adults during the pandemic but recovered faster. Mindfulness does not only work during stressful periods but always. Mindfulness works for everyone not only for the youth or adults.","['Corona', 'jongeren', 'mindfulness', 'mentale gezondheid']"

However, the gap in current research suggests that there is not sufficient insight on how maladaptive perfectionism can be fortified by the occurrence of imposter syndrome, a closely related phenomena that may lead to feelings of inadequacy and incompetence. Both perfectionism and imposterism are based on unrealistically high or hard to attain expectations of oneself. This study examined whether maladaptive perfectionism and imposter syndrome together potentially lead to depression, anxiety and stress in university students. With a sample of 69 Leiden University students, analysis has shown that the expected relationship was significant for all three dependent variables: depression (F(2,66) = 14.796, p < 0.001), anxiety (F(2,66) = 12.403, p < 0.001) and stress (F(2,66) = 21.906, p < 0.001). One of the possible shortcomings of this study could have been that it did not factor out the possibility of Covid-19 related psychological distress. Hence, the possibility of external factors unrelated to this study, such as the potential contribution of Covid-19 stress uncontrolled for in this study, may not have been singled out, subtly strengthening the correlation between the variables. Nonetheless, this study sheds light on how maladaptive perfectionism and imposter syndrome act together on the mental health of university students, bringing forward an insight that can be used in clinical practice and replicated for different samples in future research.","['Maladaptive perfectionism, imposter syndrome, depression, anxiety, stress']"

Het doel van dit onderzoek is dan ook om te kijken of culturele verschillen een significante moderator is tussen de therapeutische relatie en drop-out. In dit onderzoek zijn zelfrapportage vragenlijsten afgenomen in beide condities: (a) patiënt en therapeut met dezelfde culturele achtergrond; (b) patiënt en therapeut met een verschillende culturele achtergrond. De onderzoekspopulatie bestaat uit 73 ambulante (oud-) patiënten tussen de 18 en 65 jaar die individuele therapie hebben gevolgd in Nederland en willen deelnemen aan dit onderzoek. Uit dit onderzoek is middels een moderatie analyse gebleken dat culturele verschillen en de therapeutische relatie geen significante voorspellers zijn voor drop-out. Deze resultaten komen echter niet overeen met de gevonden literatuur. Deze discrepantie kan worden verklaard doordat dit onderzoek gelimiteerd is door een lage validiteit. Desondanks is het belangrijk om vervolgonderzoek te blijven doen hiernaar. Het is raadzaam om dan een grotere steekproefgrootte te hebben en de diagnose(s) en behandeltechniek mee te nemen als variabelen. Met behulp van deze kennis kan de interculturele patiënt gelijkwaardige kwaliteit van zorg ontvangen als de patiënt die dezelfde culturele achtergrond heeft als zijn of haar therapeut.

Neural gain modulatie in ADHD tijdens het getal-classificatie task-switching paradigma,"Tahboun, Najlae","['Jobgkees, B.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Cognitive flexibility and stability are at the expense of each other: you cannot be focused and cognitively flexible at the same time. This means that there is a trade-off between them. In which state your brain is in, depends on the current neural gain your brain adopts. Neural gain can be defined as the mechanism that either increases or decreases the intensity of both the activation and inhibition of neuron units. Cognitive stability is associated with a high neural gain, and cognitive flexibility is linked with a low neural gain. Previous studies showed that people with ADHD generally perform badly on tasks that require stability. So you can assume that people with ADHD-characteristics are less likely to adopt a high neural gain, compared to ‘neurotypical’ people. This assumption is examined with the ‘digit-classification task-switching paradigm’. This paradigm included two conditions: one with frequently congruent stimuli, and the other with frequently incongruent stimuli. The behaviors that were observed within this experiment were put in Musslick et al.’s computational model, so that the matching neural gain could be calculated. This study did not show a increase of neural gain as a result of a higher quantity of incongruent trials. However, the behavior in terms of reaction time and error rates was consistent with the prediction: there is a larger switch cost and a smaller incongruence cost in de frequently congruent condition. Other findings of this research includes that ADHD-score does not have an influence on the neural gain within the two conditions.",

Also, there has been looked at the interaction effect between symptoms of ADHD and behavior disorders on friendship quality. For this research, 119 participants between twelve and sixteen years old have filled in online questionnaires, the ADHD self-report questionnaire, the SDQ for behavior issues and the FSQ and NRI for friendship quality. There’s been a multiple hierarchical regression analysis performed in which there was not a significant model and main effect found of symptoms of ADHD and behavior disorders on friendship quality. There was also not a significant effect in the interaction effect of symptoms of ADHD and behavior disorders on friendship quality. This study shows that the results are not aligned with the hypotheses and earlier research and it is of importance that further research takes a different age range into account of adolescents (14-17) in regard to gender and using extended questionnaires in which other context will be integrated as well.",

Een van deze filosofen was Pyrrho van Elis. Pyrrho zou met zijn filosofische benadering op gebeurtenissen rust bereiken. Mensen met overmatige angstklachten ervaren onrust. Zij beredeneren uitkomsten op gebeurtenissen negatiever en nemen positieve uitkomsten minder in overweging. Het is bekend dat vrouwen gevoeliger zijn voor angst. Wellicht heeft gender ook invloed op de relatie tussen het oordelen en de mate van ervaren van angst. In deze studie is onderzoek gedaan naar de relatie tussen het uitstellen van oordeel (suspension of judgement; SOJ) en angst en het moderatie effect van gender. Er is online een vragenlijst afgenomen. Een exploratory factor analysis is uitgevoerd op het SOJ-meetinstrument. Een lineaire en multipele regressieanalyses zijn uitgevoerd op totaalscores van SOJ en angst met gender als moderatie effect. De exploratory factor analysis gaf aan dat er een relatie is tussen de variabelen en dat er 4 verschillende onderliggende factoren zijn. De relaties tussen de variabelen zijn sterker wanneer alleen de intuïtieve vragen, vragen met tijdsdruk maar zonder argumentatie, worden meegenomen. Uit de regressieanalyse kwam een niet significant resultaat. Er is geen relatie tussen SOJ en de mate angst, wel is er een kleine relatie tussen de intuïtieve vragen van SOJ en angst gevonden.

Het effect van dissociatie op de relatie tussen impulsiviteit en relatiegeweld: een moderatie-analyse,"Jonker, Esmée","['Hoogenboom, A.W.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Inleiding: Geweld in een relatie gaat gepaard met ernstige fysieke, mentale en economische gevolgen waardoor het van belang is dat relatiegeweld zoveel mogelijk wordt tegengegaan. Impulsiviteit is een kenmerk van borderline persoonlijkheidsstoornis en zorgt ervoor dat men moeite heeft met het remmen van responsen wat kan leiden tot meer agressiviteit. Een ander kenmerk van borderline persoonlijkheidsstoornis is dissociatie. Deze heeft als gevolg dat iemand zich kan afzonderen van de werkelijkheid en minder empathie kan ervaren. Omdat impulsiviteit gerelateerd is aan agressie wordt verwacht dat impulsiviteit een rol speelt bij het plegen van relatiegeweld. Doordat dissociatie ook een kenmerk is van borderline persoonlijkheidsstoornis en het invloed kan hebben op de relatie tussen impulsiviteit en het plegen van relatiegeweld, wordt er verwacht dat dissociatie een modererend effect heeft op deze relatie. Methode: Data werd verzameld via een online vragenlijst die werd verspreid via sociale media, een onderzoeksparticipatiewebsite van Universiteit Leiden en via flyers op de Faculteit der Sociale Wetenschappen. Met een uiteindelijke aantal respondenten van n = 187 werd een moderatie analyse uitgevoerd door middel van PROCESS Macro. Resultaten: Er was een significant positieve relatie tussen impulsiviteit en relatiegeweld. Echter was er geen significant modererend effect gevonden van dissociatie. Daarbij was er geen significante relatie tussen dissociatie en het plegen van relatiegeweld. Discussie: Impulsiviteit zorgt dus voor het vaker plegen van relatiegeweld. Daarbij heeft dissociatie geen invloed op de relatie tussen impulsiviteit en het plegen van relatiegeweld. Er is echter meer onderzoek nodig naar de rol van dissociatie bij relatiegeweld.","['Impulsiviteit', 'Relatiegeweld', 'Dissociatie', 'Borderline', 'Persoonlijkheidsstoornis', 'BPS', 'Moderatie-analyse']"
"The Relationship Between Sexual and Emotional Abuse, Dissociation, and Attachment – A Moderation Analysis","Noorlander, Fenna","['Hoogenboom, A.W.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Introduction: Dissociation has been associated with multiple clinical psychological disorders and can have severely disruptive effects on people’s lives. Childhood abuse, especially sexual (CSA) and emotional (CEA), seems to be an important predictor of dissociation. The relationship between these factors may be influenced by attachment, as insecure attachment has been found to function as a risk factor for dissociation and can influence the way someone deals with childhood abuse. However, this relationship has not yet been specifically investigated. Thus, this study investigates whether CSA and CEA predict dissociation and whether this relationship is moderated by disrupted attachment. Methods: Using an online survey, CSA, CEA, dissociation, and attachment were assessed in a sample from the general population (n = 187). A multiple linear regression was performed, followed by a moderation analysis using the PROCESS macro. Results: CSA did not significantly predict dissociation, while CEA did. The overall moderation model for dissociation was significant. However, the direct and interaction effects were not significant, thus there was no moderating effect of attachment. Discussion: These results are remarkable in light of existing literature but may be heavily impacted by study characteristics. Nevertheless, the role of emotional abuse in relation to severe psychological problems is emphasised and needs further attention. More research into the studied factors is needed in order to improve the understanding of the complex pathways that are involved.","['Dissociation, childhood sexual abuse, childhood emotional abuse, attachment']"
The Association Between Hypomanic Personality and Reward Sensitivity,"Piskiner, Ela","['Koenders, M.A.', 'de Kleijn, R.E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Hypomanic personality is a ‘characterological’ condition or temperamental affective style, characterised by persistent propensities towards elevated mood, optimism, extraversion, energetic temperament and goal-directed behaviour. Considering reward sensitivity to be a predisposition towards seeking novel and risky experiences and establishing hypomania as a personality trait, using a sample of 66 participants, this paper focused on whether reward sensitivity (measured by the BART) can be described in terms of a correlate, vulnerability and/or predictor of hypomanic personality (measured by the HPS). Additionally, the effects of virtual reality provoked mood induction on the relationship between the HPS and the BART was examined. The BART scores were analysed on the basis of the mean number of burst balloons and the mean number of puffs. There was no evidence to support that HPS scores has an effect on the BART performance, both for number of burst balloons (F (1, 61) = 2.304, p = 0.134), and for number of balloon puffs (F (1, 61) = .007, p = .935). Similarly, the statistical analysis provided support for mood-induction not influencing the relationship between the HPS scores and the BART scores. Possible explanations and potential limitations of the study were further discussed.",

Exploring the dimensionality of risk perception and its effects on medication refusal in the context of side effect information,"Väyrynen, Joonas",['Sanne J.W. Willems'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Research in the past decade has set a new paradigm in the study of risk perception. Historically considered a purely cognitive process, researchers have proposed an affective dimension to improve the construct. However, recent studies in medicine have encountered mixed results when statistically looking for this second dimension. My study aimed to test the dimensionality of risk perception, support this analysis with some additional statistical measures, as well as use risk perception scores to build a model of a relevant outcome variable; medication refusal. 176 people adequately answered a questionnaire which asked participants to imagine a hypothetical scenario where they had a chronic illness, were offered a drug to relieve their symptoms and presented a patient information leaflet about the side effects of the drug. The questions measured elements of risk perception about the side effects of the drug, as well as the participants’ willingness to use it. Statistical analyses found only a single risk perception dimension, although there were considerable limitations in the design of the study that likely biased the results. The predictive model between risk perception and drug taking was not powerful enough for practical application due to its low explained variance. Because of this, it was also hard to interpret if the model supports the two-dimension hypothesis. Finally, affective salience moderated the association between affective, but not cognitive risk perception and medication compliance. While supporting the distinction between the two dimensions, the finding also suggests a dynamic interaction between the two dimensions. This study provides further, but to some degree mixed, evidence against the two-dimension risk perception paradigm and highlights the complexity in predicting medication compliance.","['Risk perception, Medication refusal, Patient information leaflet, Drug side effects']"

Influence of auditory distraction on purchasing behavior in an online shopping environment,"Bekker, Kevin","['Weiden, A. van der']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Distraction has been shown to increase the time people spend in a physical store as well as the amount of purchases people make in a physical store. However, many people shop online, and the online market seems to be growing. The current research investigated if the findings of earlier research of distraction in a physical store are replicable to an online shopping environment. It was tested if distraction would increase the amount of time people spend, and amount of purchases people make in an online shopping environment. Participants were asked to perform a shopping task in an artificial webshop, and they were split into two groups. One group was distracted by an audio fragment while performing the shopping task, and the other group was not distracted. The amount of time that participants spend in the webshop, and the amount of purchases that participants made were measured. Although the distraction manipulation, as measured by self-report, seemed to be effective, no significant differences in amount of purchases and time spend in the webshop was found between the groups. These findings suggest a different effect of distraction in online shopping environments compared to shopping in a physical stores. This effect could be explained by the different ways people navigate through a physical store compared to a webshop.","['distraction', 'online shopping', 'consumer behavior']"
Factors Engaging Entrepreneurs to Achieve Work Life Balance: The moderating role of Growth Pursuit and Conscientiousness on Work-Life Balance Crafting among Entrepreneurs,"Cholopoulou, Anastasia","['Prasastyoga, B.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Entrepreneurship has been found one of the most stressful professions due to the overall pressure and need for achievement it comprises. Entrepreneurs often fail to bring the balance between the work and life domain, which leads to weaker job performance as well as well- being. However, entrepreneurs’ work life balance crafting engagement has found to bring various positive personal, organizational and financial outcomes. But what determines the extent to which entrepreneurs will engage in such behaviors? To answer this question, there are two hypotheses. Firstly, growth pursuit will negatively predict WLB crafting engagement and secondly conscientiousness will positively predict WLB crafting engagement among entrepreneurs. Part of a bigger cross-sectional study, 144 entrepreneurs, recruited from Prolific, participated on an online survey and were part of a two-stage hierarchical multiple regression analysis (MRA). The analysis indicated positive non-significant results for both growth pursuit and conscientiousness. Contradicting the study’s hypotheses as well as indications of past research, this thesis gives valuable insights with regards to why some entrepreneurs engage in WLB crafting more than others. Limitations, suggestions for future research as well as implications of the present study are discussed in detail.","['entrepreneurs, work-life balance (WLB), work-life balance crafting (WLB crafting), growth pursuit, conscientiousness, well-being']"

Gametijd per week werd verkregen door een algemene vragenlijst. Participanten speelden een videogame met willekeurig toegewezen stedelijke of natuurlijke omgeving. Herstellend vermogen werd gemeten door een voor- en nameting van de Corsi Block-Tapping Task. Participanten scoorden beter na het spelen van de videogame, maar dit was niet significant (t(85) = 1.95, p = .055). Daarnaast was er geen verschil in scores tussen de stedelijke en natuurlijke omgeving (t(84) = .79, p = .430). Als laatste was gametijd per week (β < .000, p = .574) geen goede voorspeller voor het verschil in scores. In conclusie, er is niet genoeg bewijs om te stellen dat een virtuele omgeving in een videogame herstellende kwaliteiten heeft. Er was geen verschil tussen het herstellend vermogen van een natuurlijke of stedelijke omgeving.

The present study investigated the relationship between perfectionism and feedback learning, and if reward sensitivity plays a mediating role in this relationship. We wanted to examine whether adaptive perfectionism (AP) and maladaptive perfectionism (MP) predict differences in feedback learning, tending more towards positive or negative feedback learning. Furthermore, we examined if this relationship might be influenced by one's sensitivity to different types of feedback: reward and punishment. Participants (N = 113) carried out a probabilistic learning task and completed the Almost Perfect Scale Revised and the Sensitivity to Punishment Sensitivity to Reward questionnaires. We found no differences in feedback learning between adaptive and maladaptive participants. Correspondingly, we also did not find mediating roles for reward and punishment sensitivity. However, we did find a strong significant relationship between maladaptive perfectionism and punishment sensitivity. These results remained unchanged when we carried out an exploratory analysis, using only perfectionistic participants. Because existing literature points towards strong correlations between perfectionism, feedback learning, and reward sensitivity, more research is needed to investigate the links between these constructs.","['Positive feedback learning', 'negative feedback learning', 'adaptive perfectionism', 'maladaptive perfectionism', 'reward sensitivity', 'punishment sensitivity']"

Dit groeiende probleem vraagt om een meer preventieve oplossing dan alleen het gebruik van medicatie en therapie. In dit onderzoek wordt er gekeken naar wat het effect van sporten is op depressieve klachten en specifiek wat de mediërende rol is van Self-Esteem en Self-Efficacy in deze relatie. Methode: Na een literatuuronderzoek over de bestaande artikelen, is er via Qualtrics een online-enquête samengesteld uit bestaande vragenlijsten, zoals de PHQ-9, GSES, RSES en GPAQ. Na de dataverzameling is er een selectie gemaakt van respondenten (N=91) die gebruikt zijn in dit onderzoek. Vervolgens zijn er twee mediatie-analyses uitgevoerd om de hypothesen, dat Self-Esteem en Self-Efficacy positief worden beïnvloed door Lichamelijke Activiteit en een verbeterend effect hebben op depressieve klachten, te testen. Resultaat: Uit de preliminaire-analyse bleek een zwakke correlatie tussen lichamelijke activiteit en depressieve klachten. Dit is in tegenspraak met de bestaande literatuur die stelt dat er een significant effect zou zijn. Na de mediatie-analyses werd er geen mediatie-effect gevonden van Self-Esteem en Self-Efficacy, wat wederom niet in lijn was met de bestaande literatuur. Conclusie: Er werd geen indirect effect gevonden voor Self-Esteem en Self-Efficacy, waardoor er aangenomen werd dat er geen mediatie-effect bestond. Daarnaast bleek de correlatie tussen Lichamelijke activiteit en depressieve klachten veel kleiner dan er in de literatuur beschreven werd.

Online concentration was measured by devising a questionnaire with questions regarding concentration during online lectures. A total number 118 respondents were included in this study, aged between 18-63 years old. A hierarchical linear regression analysis was performed to assess the amount of variance in online concentration that could be explained by music listening, after controlling for resilience. The results show that both resilience and music listening explain a significant proportion of the variance in online concentration, even after controlling for correlations between variables. The findings suggest that being a highly resilient individual positively influences online concentration and that listening to music often on a day-to-day basis negatively influences online concentration.","['music listening', 'online concentration', 'frequency of listening to music', 'musical coping and responsivity scale', 'connor-davidson resilience scale']"
"The relationship between musical training, trait empathy and musical preferences","Rijssel, Susan van","['Julie Hall', 'Rebecca Schaefer']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Previous studies have suggested that musical training can enhance trait empathy. However, it remains unclear how long an individual should have had musical training for it to enhance trait empathy. This study investigated the relationship between musical training of a minimum of one year and trait empathy. Furthermore, the relationship between different musical preferences and trait empathy were researched since most studies only focus on sad-sounding music. To investigate the relationships several simple linear regression analyses were performed and one multiple linear regression analysis was performed using the information of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; Pulos et al., 2004), the Musical Coping and Responsivity Scale (MCRS; Schaefer et al., in prep) and the Short Test of Music Preferences questionnaire (STOMP; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003). The results show that musical training of a minimum of one year does predict higher levels of trait empathy. Moreover, the data shows that trait empathy and the musical preferences Blues, Jazz and Alternative Music have a coherence with trait empathy. The other twelve musical preferences do not have an effect on trait empathy. However, these results should be seen as an indication since the multiple regression analysis was not significant. Concluded, the results show that musical training could be effective to be used from an early age to increase trait empathy, which is beneficial for the development of social and personal skills, health, and well-being.","['musical training', 'trait empathy', 'musical preferences']"

Impulsivity and Compulsivity have been viewed as opposite ends of a continuum, with the first being connected to increased reward seeking and the second with increased harm avoidance/anxiety, according to the traditional Model. On the other hand, according to the Metacontrol State Model (MSM) the Impulsivity/Compulsivity spectrum can be the result of the neurocognitive endophenotypes of cognitive persistence and cognitive flexibility. This scientific study seeks to answer the question of whether the variance in the continuum can be predicted by the traditional model of reward sensitivity, and anxiety/harm avoidance, and whether the MSM parameters of flexibility and persistence can account for additional or even superior variance in the Impulsivity-Compulsivity spectrum. To that end, the Stroop task, the Alternative Uses Task, the S-UPPS, and the Monetary Delay (MID) task were used to assess individual differences in the aforementioned endophenotypes across 41 participants. The results of the study illustrate a significant relationship between Impulsivity and cognitive flexibility and Compulsivity and persistence, which explained higher variance in the data as compared to the traditional model parameters. Therefore, this indicates that the Metacontrol State Model (MSM) may be a more appropriate explanation of the Impulsivity-Compulsivity spectrum than the approach and avoidance sensitivity proposed by the traditional model.",

It’s purpose is to provide a new and efficient way of spending break time, whether at work or at home, to lower negative affect. Previous research has mainly focused on either the restorative effects of different environments or the restorative effects of videogames. The participants in this study were randomly assigned to either an urban or a nature environment in the game and completed a similar set of tasks in the game.

Participants in the nature environment as well as the urban environment exhibited lower negative affect after playing the videogame in comparison with before, with no significant difference between the two environments. This research suggests that playing a videogame has the potential to decrease negative affect, regardless of whether a nature or a more urban environment is given. This gives it restorative potential for negative affect.

The answers of the respondents have been used in multiple simple regression analyses and a MANOVA. These analyses proved that there are no significant differences between the variables. In all hypotheses the assumptions were violated, as a result that the analyses were not meant to be executed. However, there has been chosen to still execute the analyses. Against all expectations, the cultural distance and generation did not have an influence on openness and contentment of the client. More research is recommended, as the sample group is small and as the α and power are low. In the future the missing Hofstede dimensions should also be taken into account. In de therapeutische context staat cultuur centraal, waarbij er gekeken wordt naar de juiste manier om de cliënt te helpen. Met gebruik van Hofstedes cultuurafstand kan cultuur meegenomen worden in de therapievorm. De openheid en tevredenheid van de cliënt kan hierdoor beïnvloed worden. Ook generatie speelt hier een rol in. Als er gekeken wordt naar de openheid en tevredenheid van een cliënt, met inachtneming van de cultuurafstand en generatiecijfers, is dit te meten door middel van een vragenlijst. In dit onderzoek is gebruik gemaakt van de CALPAS-P, wat vierentwintig vragen bevat. Hier zijn extra demografische vragen aan toegevoegd. De voorspelling is dat culturele afstand en generatie invloed hebben op de openheid en tevredenheid van de cliënt. Dit onderzoek heeft een N van 166 respondenten, waarbij 58 respondenten niet alles of niets hebben ingevuld. Over de resultaten zijn eenvoudige regressieanalyses en een MANOVA uitgevoerd. Deze analyses toonden aan dat er geen significant verschil gevonden kon worden op de variabelen. In alle hypotheses werden de assumpties geschonden, waardoor de analyses niet uitgevoerd mochten worden. Toch is ervoor gekozen deze uit te voeren. Tegen de verwachting in, hadden de culturele afstand en generatie geen invloed op de openheid en tevredenheid van de cliënt. Meer onderzoek wordt aangeraden, aangezien de steekproef klein was en een lage α en lage power bevatte. In de toekomst kan daarbij eveneens rekening gehouden worden met de missende Hofstededimensies.","['Cultural distance', 'openheid', 'tevredenheid', 'interculturele context', 'therapeutische relatie', 'Hofstede']"

Deze studie onderzocht de samenhang tussen sociale angst en prosociaal gedrag ten opzichte van een vriend, een anoniem persoon en een persoon die niet leuk wordt gevonden in de adolescentie. Daarnaast werd er gekeken naar de invloed van geslacht op deze samenhang. Eenenzestig adolescenten tussen de negen en twaalf jaar (M leeftijd = 10.88; SD = 0.86; 47.5% meisjes) vulden hiervoor de Youth Anxiety Measure over sociale angst in en speelden een Prosocial Donation Task. Hierbij werd het prosociale gedrag ten opzichte van de verschillende ontvangers gemeten door tien muntjes te verdelen tussen de adolescent en ontvanger (Vriend, Anoniem persoon, Niet leuk persoon). Resultaten toonden aan dat er geen samenhang is tussen sociale angst en prosociaal gedrag. Bovendien heeft geslacht geen aantoonbare invloed op dit gebrek aan samenhang. De resultaten benadrukken dat sociale angst en prosociaal gedrag losstaande concepten zijn die beiden eigen methodes vereisen om te verbeteren.","['sociale angst, prosociaal gedrag']"
Intolerance of Uncertainty: Its relations to state-trait anxiety and social feedback learning,"Susanto, Michael","['Saadat, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) was found to be a transdiagnostic construct that connects multiple disorders, such as general anxiety disorder, social anxiety, worry, and state/trait anxiety. Factor analytic studies identified two significantly distinct components of IU, namely Prospective and Inhibitory IU. Although IU was generally associated with State/Trait Anxiety, it remains unclear how they are related on the subscale level. This study examined the relationship between Prospective/Inhibitory IU and State/Trait Anxiety. Secondly, previous studies found that high-IU individuals are slower in their performance compared to low-IU counterparts. This study investigated the influence of IU on performance in social feedback learning. It compares the reaction times of high- and low-IU individuals in estimating feedbacks from peers. A total of 175 Leiden University students participated in the experiment. Questionnaires, such as the IUS-12 and the STAI, were used for assessment. In the SELF-Profile paradigm, participants had to estimate whether or not four chosen peers liked them. IU was significantly correlated with Trait Anxiety (p < .01) but not State Anxiety. However, no significant difference was found between high- and low-IU individuals in estimating feedbacks from peers. This study argued that the transdiagnostic relations of IU should be made specific, since differential relations between them exist. Secondly, the nature of the task in the experiment could influence participants’ threshold of ambiguity perception. That is, when the task does not elicit enough ambiguity, even participants with high IU might not be triggered to perceive uncertainty.","['Prospective IU', 'Inhibitory IU', 'State-Trait Anxiety', 'social feedback learning', 'SELF-Profile paradigm', 'adults', 'differential relations', 'ambiguity perception']"
"The effect of an observer: The relationship between self-reported social anxiety, social presence and performance on a reinforcement learning task","Wikström, Anna",['Ruya Akdag'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social anxiety disorder is one of the most prevalent psychological disorders in the world today, and is associated with significant disability. It can have detrimental effects on social and cognitive function, including biases in learning and perception. The current study investigated the interacting effects of self-reported social anxiety and social presence on performance accuracy and response time during a reinforcement learning task in a sample of university students (N=121). Differences in response time were used as a measure of efficiency in order to draw conclusions about processing speed. Performance accuracy was used to determine effectiveness and the extent to which social anxiety is associated with biases in feedback learning. The task included a social condition in which participants were observed and a standard condition in which they completed the task alone. Performance effectiveness and efficiency in both conditions were compared in the statistical analysis. The results of the study fail to support the idea that social anxiety is related to biases in feedback learning or deficits in processing speed when being observed. However, the study found that social presence is significantly associated with differences in performance accuracy on positive versus negative trials although unrelated to levels of social anxiety. The results are discussed in relation to sample characteristics and the nature of the task. Importance is placed on the effect of social presence on performance effectiveness even when the social-evaluative threat is minimally invasive.","['Social anxiety, social presence, probabilistic learning, feedback learning, positive and negative feedback']"

In one condition no audience was present and in the other condition the researchers stayed in the room. The age group between 8-10 years old expressed a more intense expression of embarrassment than the other two age groups. No difference was observed in the presence of the expression of pride between the age groups. Besides, more participants showed the expression of pride in the condition with the audience than without. This difference was not observed in the intensity of the expression of embarrassment.

A Study on Medicine Side Effect Risk Estimation: Can the 50% blips and high confidence in answers help explain side effect risk overestimations?,"Cho, Nozomi",['Dr. S.J.W. Willems'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Medicine side effects are generally overestimated. This is possibly caused by the tendency to describe any risk at 50%, referred to as the “50% blips”. These 50% blips have been associated with participants indicating to not knowing the answer and low numeracy levels. The aim of this study is to investigate whether we observe the 50% blips in a series of low probability side effects risk estimation questions and to analyse if this can be explained by the participants’ confidence in their estimation. Data was collected through a survey, consisting of a Subjective Numeracy Scale (SNS), four side effect risk estimation questions and a follow-up question to assess the participants’ confidence in their answer. We observed no uses of 50%. We presume this is a consequence of our study set-up, primarily because our research sample is highly homogenous and consisted of high education level and high numeracy level students. We conclude that the 50% blips does not apply in high education and high numeracy level groups. This is in line with previous research that found an association between the use of 50% and low education and high numeracy level. More research on this topic is needed to gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms of health risk estimations on Patient Information Leaflets (PILs).","['risk perception', 'side effect risk', '50% blips', 'confidence', 'subjective numeracy.']"

Mental Health Conditions as Predictor for Anxiety in Students During the Pandemic,"Weve, Jip","['Molendijk, M.L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,The Covid-19 pandemic has plunged many countries into a lockdown affecting the daily lives of students by limiting access to almost all public venues including universities. Students with pre-existing mental health disorders might be more susceptible to the negative effects associated with Covid-19 on their levels of anxiety. This research compared the experienced anxiety levels and duration between students with and without pre-existing mental health disorders and determined if these effects were persistent after one-year of lockdown. Differences between the types of mental health disorders were also explored. Students (N = 478) from three different courses were asked to fill out an online questionnaire about their mental health history and experienced anxiety during the Covid-19 pandemic. Students suffering from pre-existing mental health disorders (n = 167) experienced significantly greater anxiety levels and this anxiety is of greater duration compared to otherwise healthy students (n = 311). These effects persisted over a one-year period. Nationality of students significantly contributed to the levels of experienced anxiety with non-Dutch students reporting higher levels of anxiety relative to Dutch students. No apparent differences between the types of mental health disorder were found. Students with a mental health history seem to be impacted more by the pandemic. Underlying reasons may include decreased psychological flexibility and inadequate coping strategies to counteract the drastic changes experienced by the pandemic and ensuing lockdown. These findings demonstrate the vulnerable position some students are in and emphasises the need for the development of prevention programs and adequate treatment.,"['anxiety', 'Covid-19', 'pre-existing mental health disorders', 'students']"

Genderverschillen in de relatie tussen zelfvertrouwen en angstklachten,"Pieters, Noor",['Dr. M.S. Tollenaar'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Achtergrond: Zelfvertrouwen duidt op hoe wij naar onszelf kijken en de mate waarin wij een houding van acceptatie of afwijzing tegenover onszelf hebben. Een laag zelfvertrouwen kan verband houden met symptomen van emotionele stoornissen, zoals depressie en angst (Wery & Cullinan, 2011). Objective: Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te achterhalen hoe de mate van zelfvertrouwen bij jongeren van invloed is op het ervaren van angst. Daarnaast wordt er onderzocht of er een verschil is in deze relatie voor jongens en meisjes. Methoden: Er zijn vragenlijsten afgenomen bij 115 adolescenten. Waarvan 37 jongens en 78 meisjes, met een gemiddelde leeftijd van 15,8 jaar (SD = 1,42). De vragenlijsten die gebruikt zijn om antwoord te geven op de onderzoeksvraag zijn de Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorder (SCARED-71) en de Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES). Vervolgens is de relatie tussen zelfvertrouwen en angst gemeten aan de hand van een enkelvoudige regressie analyse. De invloed van gender op deze relatie is getoetst aan de hand van een moderatie analyse. Resultaten: Er bleek een sterke, negatieve relatie te zijn tussen de twee variabelen zelfvertrouwen en angst (β = -.824, p < .001). Meer zelfvertrouwen hangt samen met minder angst. Gender heeft geen invloed op deze relatie (βinteractie = -1.903, p = .224). Conclusie: De resultaten ondersteunen de verwachting dat zelfvertrouwen sterk samenhangt met angst. Daarentegen wordt de verwachting van het effect van gender niet ondersteunt. Om verdere conclusies te trekken over een mogelijk causaal verband tussen zelfvertrouwen en angst is vervolgonderzoek nodig.

De Relatie tussen Gedragsinhibitie en Buikpijn in Jongens en Meisjes van 5 en 10 jaar,"Pet, Britt","['Vreeke, L.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Volgens het biopsychosociale model van angst zijn er verschillende biologische, psychologische en sociale factoren die kunnen bijdragen aan de ontwikkeling van een angststoornis. Eén van deze factoren is gedragsinhibitie, een stabiel temperamentskenmerk dat bestaat uit verlegenheid, teruggetrokken gedrag en angst in respons op nieuwe situaties en onbekende mensen. Een andere factor is buikpijn. Specifieker buikpijn zonder medische verklaring, genaamd functionele buikpijn. Mogelijk is er een relatie tussen deze twee factoren aanwezig. Veel onderzoeken naar gedragsinhibitie en buikpijn hebben verschillende resultaten gevonden wat betreft de prevalentie van beide factoren in verschillende geslachten en leeftijden. Dit onderzoek heeft onderzocht of er daadwerkelijk een relatie aanwezig is tussen gedragsinhibitie en buikpijn. Daarnaast is er ook gekeken naar de effecten van geslacht en leeftijd op gedragsinhibitie en op buikpijn in de relatie met gedragsinhibitie. Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd met bestaande data van GGD Amsterdam uit de periode 2018-2021. 23374 ouders hebben de screeningslijst van Jij en Je Gezondheid ingevuld, welke onder andere de BIQ-SF, wat gedragsinhibitie meet, en een vragenlijst over buikpijnfrequentie bevat. De resultaten laten zien dat er een zwakke, positieve relatie aanwezig is tussen gedragsinhibitie en buikpijn. Meisjes en 5-jarige kinderen hebben een hoger niveau van gedragsinhibitie dan jongens en 10-jarige kinderen. Daarentegen ervaren alleen meisjes frequenter buikpijn dan jongens, wat versterkt wordt door een hoger niveau van gedragsinhibitie. Deze bevindingen tonen aan hoe belangrijk het is om tijdens de vroege screening van angst vooral meisjes en jonge kinderen te benaderen en de relatie tussen gedragsinhibitie en buikpijn niet te negeren, zeker niet bij meisjes, om het mogelijke risico op een angststoornis zo veel mogelijk te verkleinen.",

Behandelversterkende placebotoepassingen versterken een lopende medische behandeling terwijl behandel-vervangend een placebotoepassing is een op zichzelf staande behandeling. Om placebotoepassingen in te zetten in de pediatrische zorg is het belangrijk om te onderzoeken hoe ouders en zorgverleners tegenover placebotoepassingen staan. Ondanks een algemene positieve attitude is er nog weinig kennis over de acceptatie van placebotoepassingen onder ouders en zorgverleners en mogelijke verschillen tussen acute en chronische aandoeningen en behandelversterkende tegenover behandel-vervangende placebotoepassingen. In deze thesis is het verschil in acceptatie onderzocht van placebotoepassingen onder ouders en zorgverleners tussen pediatrische patiënten met een acute of chronische aandoening. Van 178 participanten waren er 28 ouders en 150 zorgverleners. Het onderzoek had een cross-sectioneel observationeel design. Bij geen van de acht placebotoepassingen was een verschil in acceptatie tussen acute en chronische aandoeningen. Onder zorgverleners werd de behandelversterkende (t(125) = -3.655, p < .001) en de behandel-vervangende (t(121) = -8.724, p < .001) placebotoepassing meer geaccepteerd voor chronische aandoeningen.

Als er een vorm van misleiding gebruikt wordt bij de placebotoepassingen kan dit samengaan met een lagere acceptatie terwijl meer informatie over concrete placebotoepassingen samengaat met een hogere acceptatie van het inzetten ervan in de ziekenhuiszorg voor kinderen.",
Werkbereidheid bij het basisinkomen: Een onderzoek naar het effect van een basisinkomen op de werkbereidheid van jongeren.,"Dai, Serlina",['Dr. B. Vuyk'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"A universal basic income (UBI) is a government program in which citizens regularly receive a fixed amount of money regardless of whether they work or not. Many opponents believe that motivation to work will decrease with the introduction of a UBI. Previous studies show different results, so it remains unclear whether the willingness to work would change. This research contributes to this discussion by further investigating the effect of a UBI on the willingness to work. In addition, the variables self-efficacy and framing were also included. The expectation was that the willingness to work would not decrease and that self-efficacy and framing would influence the choice of whether or not to work. A total of 162 students who study at Universiteit Leiden were recruited. Each of these students were placed in one of three different conditions. These are the 1. UBI condition, 2. CBI loss frame condition and 3. CBI gain frame condition. This study measured the willingness to work in each condition. The Gills & Prowse slider task was used to measure the willingness to work. The GSES questionnaire was used to measure self-efficacy. The results show that the willingness to work in the UBI condition is higher than in the CBI loss frame condition. People do not stop working when they receive a UBI and, on average, choose to work more often than people who receive a CBI. Self-efficacy appears to be unrelated to willingness to work. The findings of this study contribute to the ongoing public debate.","['UBI', 'CBI', 'Self-efficacy', 'Framing']"

The current study investigated whether online peer victimization would significantly predict positive and negative feedback learning in young adults. A moderation effect of social anxiety was also investigated. Moreover, differences between subscales 'direct' and 'indirect' online peer victimization were investigated. Relations between online peer victimization and social anxiety and between social anxiety and feedback learning were found in prior research and therefore a relation between online peer victimization and feedback learning was expected. Participants were gathered from Leiden University and its surroundings and were a priori screened for Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) scores. This experiment was part of a larger study. For the present study, the Multidimensional Offline and Online Peer Victimization (MOOPV) questionnaire and the LSAS questionnaire were used. A feedback learning paradigm was conducted, measuring the tendency to either learn from positive or negative feedback. Results show no relation between online peer victimization and feedback learning. A significant interaction effect was found for 'indirect' online peer victimization and moderator social anxiety. 'Indirect' online peer victimization was only able to predict feedback learning for people with high social anxiety. The results of this study highlight the importance of educating teachers and students on the effects of 'indirect' online peer victimization. Future research should focus on identifying underlying reasons for the difference between 'direct' and 'indirect' online peer victimization. Moreover, the interaction effect should be taken into consideration in treatment of social anxiety, as online peer victimization causes socially anxious individuals to learn more from negative feedback.","['Online peer victimization', 'positive and negative feedback learning', 'social anxiety', 'probabilistic learning task', 'young adults']"
De Distributed-plus-hub Theorie; Een Uitkomst Voor Het Aanhoudende Debat Over De Aard Van Conceptuele Representaties?,"Rodens, Ilona",['Sebo Uithol'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze studie richt zich op het debat over de aard van conceptuele representaties in het semantische geheugen. Amodale theorieën, uitgaand van amodale symbolen, zijn vrijwel alleen in staat theoretisch bewijs te leveren. Grounded theorieën, uitgaand van o.a. modaalspecifieke representaties, hebben moeite abstracties te verklaren. De distributed-plus-hub theorie van Patterson et al. (2007) daarentegen, is een hybride theorie uitgaand van modaalspecifieke representaties in combinatie met een amodale hub. Ervan uitgaande dat de anterior temporal lobe de locatie van de hub is voorspelt de theorie dat er een dominantie is voor het verwerken van vormen. Het doel van het onderzoek is om deze voorspelling te testen. Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: Heeft vormincongruentie een grotere impact op reactietijd en accuratesse dan kleurincongruentie? Om een antwoord hierop te kunnen geven is een experiment uitgevoerd. Participanten werden dierachtige stimuli waar zij nog geen ervaring mee hadden gehad, genaamd Fribbles, met de eigenschappen vorm, kleur en geluid aangeleerd. Vervolgens werden zij blootgesteld aan incongruenties van deze eigenschappen. Er werd verwacht dat een incongruentie van vorm zou zorgen voor een grotere impact op reactietijd en accuratesse dan een incongruentie van kleur. De resultaten lieten een significant effect zien van modaliteit en congruentie op accuratesse. Zoals werd verwacht heeft vormincongruentie een grotere impact op accuratesse dan kleurincongruentie. Voor reactietijd werd alleen een significant effect gevonden van congruentie. De door uitval te kleine steekproef heeft mogelijk geleid tot een type II-fout. Vervolgonderzoek moet worden afgenomen om een modaliteiteffect op reactietijd aan te kunnen tonen.","['Cognitive Psychology', 'Semantic Memory', 'Concepts', 'Grounded theories', 'Amodal theories', 'Shape dominance']"

Er zijn de grounded theorieën, waarbij sensorimotorische informatie wordt gebruikt, en de amodale theorieën, waarbij amodale symbolen wordt gebruikt. Hier wordt geen sensorische stimulatie verkregen. Patterson komt met twee theorieën. De distributed-only view, die veronderstelt dat het netwerk alleen bestaat uit de gebieden en de verbindingen daartussen, en de distributed-plus-hub view, waarbij er gecommuniceerd wordt via een hub. De distributed-plus-hub view veronderstelt dat vorm zou verschillen van andere categoriën zoals geluid en kleur, omdat elke categorie op een ander plek in het brein wordt verwerkt. Vorm wordt gerepresenteerd in het onderste deel van de temporaalcortex, die volgens de ventrale route verbonden is met het voorste gedeelte van de temporaalcortex. In dit onderzoek wordt er getest of vorm inderdaad verschilt in het semantisch netwerk. Dit wordt gedaan door participanten Greebles te laten indelen op basis van vorm, kleur en geluid. Greebles zijn vormen die niet specifiek iets voorstellen maar die wel passen in een bepaalde familie of categorie op basis van hun kenmerken. Er zijn drie categorieën greebles, waarbij elke categorie bestaat uit greebles met vergelijkbare vormen. Elke categorie heeft ook allemaal dezelfde kleur en hetzelfde geluid. Bij taak 1 worden de categorieën aangeleerd. Bij taak 2 moet de participant aangeven of de combinatie van geluid en kleur overeenkomt met die aangeleerd in taak 1. Bij taak 3 is het dezelfde opdracht, met de combinatie tussen vorm en geluid. Er wordt gekeken of de congruentie, oftewel het matchen of niet matchen van de derde eigenschap, en de modaliteit, oftewel of de derde eigenschap vorm of kleur is, effect hebben op accuracy en reactietijd om mogelijk bewijs voor de distributed-plus-hub view te geven. Congruentie heeft een significant effect op de accuracy en reactietijd, modaliteit heeft een significant effect op accuracy maar niet op reactietijd. Dit levert mogelijk bewijs op voor de distributed-plus-hub view.","['Concepten', 'concepts', 'conceptuele ontwikkeling', 'conceptual development']"

This study examined mental health levels of undergraduate students during and one year after the lockdown, with the expectation that they would experience more mental health problems. Mood and anxiety problems were assessed through an online questionnaire in two collection waves. The first wave was conducted between September and October 2020, after the first lockdown. The participants were reassessed one year later. The sample consisted of N = 478 undergraduates (mean age = 22,3; 55,6% female). A binary logistic regression revealed that during the lockdown, half of the students (50,8%) reported that the COVID-19 crisis had impacted their mood in a negative way. One year after the lockdown fewer students reported that the COVID-19 crisis had negatively impacted their mood (41,3%), F (1, 205) = 17.91, p < .001. Less than half of the students (38,9%) reported that the COVID-19 crisis had impacted their anxiety levels. One year after the lockdown 25,6% reported that the coronavirus had negatively impacted their anxiety levels, F (1, 206) = 7.49, p = .007. Previous mental health problems were associated with mood and anxiety problems in both waves. In contrast to preregistered hypotheses, experiencing mood and anxiety problems during the COVID-19 lockdown did not predict having more mood and anxiety problems one year after the COVID-19 lockdown. Undergraduate students were found to be largely resilient to the effects of lockdown measures on mental health.","['Anxiety', 'mood', 'COVID-19', 'lockdown', 'mental health', 'students']"

The relationship between parental overprotection and feedback learning with social anxiety as a mediating factor,"Meijer, Nikki","['Akdag, R']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"For the healthy development of a child parental bonding plays a crucial role. However, parental overprotection can be seen as a risk factor in the development of social anxiety. Moreover, how you learn from and process feedback can be seen as an important factor in the development of social anxiety. Because social anxiety has a huge impact on daily life, it is important to investigate its underlying mechanisms and risk factors. The goal of the present study is to investigate the relationship between parental overprotection and feedback learning with social anxiety as a mediating factor. Participants (N = 118) performed the SELF-symbol paradigm, a well-validated probabilistic learning task. This task examined the degree to which participants learned better from negative versus positive feedback. Social anxiety was measured using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale and overprotection was measured using the Parental Bonding Instrument. No significant relationships were found between parental overprotection and feedback learning, parental overprotection and social anxiety, and social anxiety and feedback learning. Furthermore, we can assume no mediation of social anxiety in the relationship between parental overprotection and feedback learning did occur. The present study is a start in further research on the underlying mechanisms between parental overprotection, feedback learning and social anxiety while taking into account the limitations of the current research.","['Feedback learning', 'overprotection', 'parental bonding', 'probabilistic learning task', 'social anxiety']"

The link between coping styles and depressive symptoms in university students with and without autism,"Groenhof, Kai",['Vasiliki Kentrou'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Most research on autism and coping is focused on parents of children with autism. There is a lack of understanding how individuals with autism cope themselves and how it may relate to their mental health. Every year more people with autism enroll into higher education, which calls for a better understanding of the potential difficulties they may face. This study focused on the relationship between autism, primary coping style and depressive symptoms in a sample of university students with and without a diagnosis of autism. A cross-sectional online survey (n = 222) was administered to explore how these factors relate by using multiple questionnaires measuring coping style, depressive symptoms, autism diagnosis and autism symptoms. Results showed that primary coping style was associated with depressive symptoms. Avoidant coping in particular was related to more depressive symptoms. However, there was no significant link between autism diagnosis and depressive symptoms. The study also found that students with autism were more likely to use avoidant and emotion-focused coping styles compared to problem-focused coping. Furthermore, coping style seems to be responsible for higher levels of depressive symptoms in students with autism, and not the autism diagnosis itself. Implications and alternative explanations for these results are discussed, together with suggestions for future research.","['autism', 'coping', 'depression', 'coping style', 'university', 'students']"
Spiegelen van een speelgezicht bij de gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) Onderzoek naar de communicatieve functie van emoties door middel van gezichtsuitdrukkingen bij gorilla’s,"Bakker, Annelin","['Zijlstra, T.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het vertonen van gezichtsuitdrukkingen is één van de manieren waarop emoties gedeeld worden met een ander individu; het heeft een communicatieve functie (Nelson & Russell, 2013). De mate waarin het spiegelen (mimicry) van gezichtsuitdrukkingen voorkomt bij gorilla’s (Gorilla gorilla) kan mogelijk iets zeggen over de communicatieve functie van emoties bij dieren. Om meer inzicht te krijgen in dit fenomeen, is in dit onderzoek onderzocht in welke mate gorilla’s een speelgezicht spiegelen wanneer zij deze observeren in een videobeeld van twee interactieve soortgenoten (experimentele conditie). Dit werd vergeleken met de mate waarin gorilla’s een speelgezicht vertonen wanneer zij een videobeeld observeren met hierin neutrale gezichtsuitdrukkingen van soortgenoten (controleconditie). De data die voor dit onderzoek gebruikt is komt uit video-opnames van gorilla’s in dierentuin Diergaarde Blijdorp te Rotterdam. Op deze video-opnames is hun vrijwillige deelname aan dit onderzoek te zien. Om de gecodeerde data te analyseren is gebruik gemaakt van de Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Er is geen significant verschil gevonden in het voorkomen van een speelgezicht bij gorilla’s tussen de experimentele conditie en de controleconditie. De nulhypothese kon niet verworpen worden. Mogelijk is dit resultaat het gevolg van een te kleine onderzoekspopulatie, een te kort gewenningsproces voor de gorilla’s aan de onderzoeksopstelling of het idee dat gorilla’s mogelijk begrijpen dat zij naar een videobeeld kijken en hierdoor anders reageren. Eventueel vervolgonderzoek zou zich kunnen richten op het verbeteren van deze beperkingen.","['emotie', 'gezichtsuitdrukking', 'mimicry', 'speelgezicht', 'spiegelen']"

Deze situatie zorgt bij veel mensen voor financiële stress, met vaak negatieve gevolgen voor hun psychologisch welzijn. Het genieten van hedonistische ervaringen kan een buffer vormen tegen stress. Veel van deze ervaringen kosten echter geld en dat zou tot meer stress kunnen leiden waardoor er minder van de ervaring genoten kan worden. Hierdoor vermindert de buffer en zullen mensen mogelijk meer problemen ervaren op het gebied van psychologisch welzijn. In het onderzoek (N = 137) is er gebruik gemaakt van een vragenlijst waarin werd gekeken naar de financiële stress (PIFS) en het hedonistisch vermogen (THC) van de respondenten. Ook zijn er vragen afgenomen over de mate van genieten tijdens verschillende hedonistische ervaringen met elk een goedkope en een dure variant. Mensen met meer financiële stress bleken minder te kunnen genieten tijdens zowel goedkope als dure hedonistische ervaringen. Wel heeft financiële stress meer effect tijdens een dure hedonistische ervaring. Verder bleek hedonistische vaardigheid geen effect te hebben op genieten, ook niet in combinatie met de prijs. Ten slotte bleek dat mensen met een hogere leeftijd vaak meer financiële stress ervaren dan jonge mensen.","['financiële stress, PIFS, hedonistische ervaringen, prijs, hedonistische vaardigheid, THC, genieten, welzijn']"

Verder wordt er gekeken of de vriendschapskwaliteit een goede voorspeller is voor het geluk van de adolescent. Deze invloeden zijn veel veranderd in verband met de huidige Covid-19 pandemie. Adolescenten zijn meer op zichzelf aangewezen en hebben een andere schoolsetting. Dit onderzoek probeert dit in kaart te brengen te brengen door een analyse van een opgezette vragenlijst. Diverse zelf-rapportage vragenlijsten zijn afgenomen bij 160 adolescenten, 11 tot 15 jaar oud. De vragenlijst bevat vragen betreffende de thuissituatie, vriendschapskwaliteit, schoolprestatie en het level van geluksgevoel bij de adolescent. Uit de meervoudige regressieanalyse bleek dat de vriendschapskwaliteit een goede voorspeller is van de schoolresultaten adolescent. Verder heeft het onderzoek aangetoond dat een hogere vriendschapskwaliteit een hogere score op geluk voorspelt. We kunnen daardoor zeggen dat vriendschapskwaliteit een belangrijke factor voor zowel prestaties op school als een hoge score op geluk. Een belangrijke implicatie van dit onderzoek betreft de hoeveelheid vragen in de zelf-rapportage vragenlijst. Voor een completer beeld zouden er meer vragen gebruikt kunnen worden. Verder kan het gebruik van zelf-rapportage vragenlijsten ook zorgen voor onnauwkeurigheden. Voor verder onderzoek naar dit onderwerp zou er gekeken kunnen worden naar de visie van ouders en docenten om zo een accurater beeld te vormen van de adolescent.","['adolescentie', 'Schoolprestatie', 'COVID-19', 'geluk', 'school', 'schoolprestatie', 'vriendschap']"
Beliefs and happiness: The relationship between beliefs and happiness moderated by a present-fatalistic time perspective,"Sikorska, Gabriela","['Berg, T. van den']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study investigated the relationship between Pyrrhonism and happiness, moderated by a present-fatalistic time perspective. Pyrrhonism is a philosophical tradition which can be regarded as an art of living, with happiness as its ultimate goal. The Pyrrhonist recognises that for every outlook on life an equal amount of affirming and disconfirming arguments can be found and thus suspends his judgement, which leads to tranquillity. The Pyrrhonian trait, indicated by an investigative, considerate and open mind, was measured using the self-constructed Pyrrhonian Trait Scale (PTS). Data were collected using an online test battery, which in addition to the PTS also consisted of the Satisfaction with Life Scale and Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory. An exploratory factor analysis was performed on the PTS to confirm the presence of underlying factors on which the scale was based. Subsequently, a regression analysis and moderation analysis were conducted using IBM SPSS. Although no significant relationships were found, Pyrrhonism was positively associated with happiness. This association was only positive in respondents scoring moderately on the present-fatalistic time perspective. Pyrrhonism might serve as a guide in daily life. Moreover, future studies could asses its effect in clinical settings.","['Happiness', 'well-being', 'ataraxia', 'mindfulness', 'Pyrrhonism', 'Pyrrho', 'Sextus Empiricus', 'time perspective', 'present-fatalistic', 'depression']"
Online and offline peer victimization and negative social learning,"Kunz, Borre","['Kortink, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Peer victimization can lead to depression, social anxiety, and suicide. Online peer victimization is an upcoming phenomenon. In this study, the relationship between the experience of online and offline peer victimization and learning from negative social feedback was investigated. It was expected that online and offline peer victimization would predict better negative social learning. This could be a possible pathway between peer victimization and depression and social anxiety. The Multidimensional Offline and Online Peer Victimization Scale (MOOPV) was used to measure the experience of online and offline peer victimization during the past six months. The Self profile task was used to measure negative social learning. Regression analyses were performed with 149 students aged between 18 and 29 (mean age = 20.41), but no significant effects were found. Therefore, it is possible that peer victimization is not a predictor of negative social learning. An alternative explanation for the fact that no effect was measured could be the few participants in this sample who have experienced offline or online peer victimization during the last six months before the study. Furthermore, the simplified way in which negative social learning was measured may have caused no effect was found. Exploratively, a weak negative correlation was found between whether someone had experienced offline peer victimization and how someone feels about themselves. In all cases, more research is needed on the path of online and offline peer victimization to depression and social anxiety to develop more effective treatment approaches.","['Peer victimization', 'social anxiety', 'social learning', 'depression']"

The participants were asked to indicate their current levels of stress before and after playing the video game, using the PANAS-X ‘serenity’ scale. No significant effects were found with a repeated measures ANOVA. As such, the current study provides no evidence that playing a video game with a nature-rich environment offers more stress relief than playing a video game with an urban environment. However, the study is a starting point for more research on the factors that play a role in this relationship, such as the extent to which the participant enjoys playing video games.",

In the past, their relocation has often been fuelled by pastoralism and trade and later, more forcefully, by civil war. In more recent times, imaginaries about destination countries seem to be shaping the mobilities of Somalis in the diaspora. In the context of the massive onward migration of Somalis from the Netherlands to England around the year 2000, this thesis attempted to gain insight into Somalis’ imaginaries about future destinations through semi-structured interviews and participant observation. Special attention was paid to content and sources of imaginaries, and to differences along the lines of gender and generations. The data was analysed through coding and through an anthropological and psychological lens. Results indicate that imaginaries mostly revolve around England and Somalia, although actual plans for migration only exist towards Somalia. While in the past imaginaries were mostly formed based on oral information, today social media and personal country visits are creating more nuanced imaginaries. Furthermore, compared to the first generation, younger Somalis are more cautious in forming positive imaginaries about destination countries. Future research should include educational background and observe how transnational migration trends among the Somali community in the Netherlands take shape across generations and in the future.","['Somalis', 'onward migration', 'imaginaries', 'transnation migration', 'mobilities']"

Naast dat het een belangrijke rol speelt in angst, hangt het ook samen met een slechter sociaal functioneren. In dit onderzoek werd daarom gekeken naar de rol van IU in individueel en prosociaal leergedrag. Verwacht werd dat men beter zou leren voor zichzelf dan voor anderen. Ervan uitgaande dat IU zorgt voor het verstoord leren van negatieve feedback, werd ook verwacht dat hoogscorenden op IU slechter zouden leren voor zichzelf en anderen dan laagscorenden op IU. Deelnemers aan het onderzoek (leeftijd 16-60, n = 136) deden een online probabilistische taak waarin ze leerden voor zichzelf, een vriend of onbekende ander. Individuele verschillen in IU werden gemeten met een online vragenlijst. Een repeated measures ANOVA toonde aan dat, zoals verwacht, deelnemers beter leerden voor zichzelf dan voor anderen (vriend of onbekende ander), maar ze leerden ook beter voor een vriend dan voor een onbekende ander. IU was daarbij niet significant gecorreleerd met de prestaties op de verschillende gedragsmaten. Leerprestaties op deze taak worden blijkbaar niet verstoord door IU, mogelijk omdat men leerde van positieve in plaats van negatieve feedback. Deze bevindingen suggereren dat klinische behandelingen van mensen met IU vooral effectief zullen werken wanneer niet straf, maar beloning daar een belangrijke plek inneemt.",

The effects of unequal group interdependence on choosing individualistic vs. collective solutions in social action problems,"Serguera Pérez, Celia","['Gross, J. A. J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The global climate crisis caused by the ongoing exploitation of the planet's public goods can be attributed to humans' short-term self-interest driven behavior and ineffective cooperation attempts. The consequences of these poor choices have created a shared global threat which can only be mitigated through collective action. This crisis has resulted in an increasing international economic interdependence that often causes resistance for successful cooperative outcomes to take place. To further our understanding of how different interdependencies affect cooperation, the collective risk social dilemma experiment in this study allowed individuals in groups of four to choose between an individualistic or collective solution in the presence of a shared problem. Participants were assigned to one of four conditions where they experienced either equally high or low group interdependence, or unequally high or low interdependence. The findings suggest that in the presence of equally low shared interdependence, individuals will opt for the individualistic solution. In the presence of unequally high shared interdependence however, we find individuals will be more prone to opt for the collective solution, regardless of their social value orientations. Further, we found that the availability of a cost incentive structure increases cooperation efforts overall, and not necessarily due to experienced inequalities. Overall, these findings suggest that a collective solution seems to be the best approach to a shared problem in the presence of unequally shared group dependencies or cost incentive structures.","['social dilemmas, risk, cooperation, public goods games, interdependence, social value orientation, punishment']"

Exploring the neural alpha band modulations during smartphone use,"Stoyanova, Daniela","['Ghosh, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Smartphones are constant multifunctional companions for the majority of the population worldwide. Smartphone applications engage a wide spectrum of cognitive functions while accommodating our daily routines. Thus, smartphones are powerful experimental tools to explore the underpinnings of cognition. Most importantly, assessing the neural correlates of smartphone usage is a probe into natural everyday behavior. Our goal was to explore the attentional modulations during smartphone use. We used the alpha band power modulations as a proxy to attention. The EEG activity of 28 university students was recorded during 3 conditions – smartphone use, interaction with a smartphone-like unresponsive object and resting state. Our exploration included 6 channel pairs over the prefrontal, sensory and visual cortex. No significant differences between alpha power modulation during the different conditions were found. There was an increase in alpha power during the resting state which is in line with mind-wandering and self-imagery processes during resting conditions. We suggest that by applying two well-researched in classical settings, EEG-derived cognitive metrics – the alpha band power and the frontal alpha asymmetry index, cognitive theories can be validated for scenarios of daily life interactions. Future larger-scale studies based on the full 64 channel data and exploring the interaction instead of a single band activity are still needed to reveal the potential influence of smartphones on neural activity.","['smartphone', 'attention', 'alpha band oscillations', 'modulation', 'meaningful behavior', 'naturalistic experiments']"
The Roles of Growth Pursuit and Perceived Behavioural Control in Work-Life Balance Crafting in Entrepreneurs,"Kieboom, Dylan","['Prasastyoga, B.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Entrepreneurs are widespread and make up for a lot of the proportion of small businesses, this makes them a crucial group to include in research. Despite that fact entrepreneurs have been strikingly absent in research concerning work-life balance (WLB) crafting. In this paper an entrepreneur sample (N=142) is used to assess the relation between growth pursuit and WLB crafting and between perceived behavioural control and WLB crafting. Multiple Regression Analysis was used to assess the predictive effect of these factors on WLB crafting in SPSS. Contrasting our hypothesis based on limited resources research it was found that growth pursuit positively predicts WLB crafting. This finding is probably explained by other research which states that people who engage in WLB crafting also have the time and motivation to pursue growth because they have a good WLB. The hypothesised effect of perceived behavioural control on WLB crafting was found to be positive and significant which was in line with our hypothesis based on an array of research which all pointed to a positive effect of perceived behavioural control on target behaviour. This is explained by the fact that people who believe they can do something actually will while others who do not believe will not even try to engage in that behaviour. Limitations and future research directions (especially into mechanisms that explain the found results) are discussed. Theoretical and practical, particularly programs which could boost work-life balance crafting and the benefits thereof, implications are discussed.","['Entrepreneurs', 'Growth Pursuit', 'Perceived Behavioural Control']"
Intimate Partner Violence and Victims of Childhood Neglect: A Gender Comparison,"Figarska, Maja","['Reinken, A. + Krause-Utz, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Despite being highly prevalent, neglect remains the least studied type of childhood maltreatment. Neglected children risk depression and anxiety, as well as severely hindered development and functionality. This poses a higher risk for experiencing abuse in (young) adulthood, namely intimate partner violence (IPV). This study focuses on 394 adults who completed the scales for emotional and physical neglect, as well as other types of childhood maltreatment, who, in their adulthood, have experienced IPV. We were interested to investigate how gender moderates the relationship between neglect and IPV. Many previous studies focused on women experiencing domestic abuse and few focused on male victims. Based on this, we hypothesized that women who experienced more severe abuse will experience more severe IPV than men. A moderation analysis revealed that gender moderates the relationship between physical and emotional neglect and IPV (F(5,366) = 5.4564, p = .0001; F(5,366) = 4.5288, p = .0005). The results indicate that being male strengthens the relationship between neglect and IPV, which is not in line with the hypothesis. Males who experience more severe neglect experience more severe IPV in future relationships in the current sample. Our findings extend previous literature, which has had a heavy focus on female victims of male perpetrators. We discuss the possible reasons for the frequency with which men get blamed, such as the reporting problem and social expectation pressures on men. Future studies should consider different methods of measurement other than self-report or retrospective studies as these can create biases.",
The Effect of Anticipated Guilt on the Gap between Green Gardening Intention and Behaviour using the Theory of Planned Behaviour,"Droppert, Carlijn","['Doesum, N.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Environmental problems such as air pollution, loss of biodiversity, and water pollution call for a change. To create a more sustainable society it is important to invest in proenvironmental behaviour, such as green gardening. This research has taken steps in understanding the green gardening intentions and behaviours of the inhabitants of Leiden, using data retrieved by students in 2021 in collaboration with the municipality of Leiden. To investigate this, the model of the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, 1991, 2020) has been used, including the variables attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. Applying anticipated guilt as a moderator, this study investigated if this emotion can help to close the gap more between intention and behaviour within the model. The results (N = 126) showed that the theory of planned behaviour significantly explains green gardening intention and behaviour. However, anticipated guilt did not influence the relationship between intention and behaviour. Nevertheless, the findings contribute to sustainable gardening research and calls for future research on positive emotions, such as anticipated pride. This study can be used for the shaping of marketing campaigns to encourage green gardening.","['green gardening', 'pro-environmental behaviour', 'theory of planned behaviour', 'intention-behaviour gap', 'anticipated guilt']"
Why Do Entrepreneurs Care About Their Work-Life Balance? An Investigation into Growth Intention and Entrepreneurial Fear of Failure as Predictors of Work-Life Balance Among Entrepreneurs,"Lenstra, Nina Cecilia",['Dr. Bram Prasastyoga'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Past research has focused on examining the state of work-life balance among entrepreneurs, while overlooking potential factors that could contribute to entrepreneurs’ intention to engage in proactive behaviors aimed at achieving satisfying work-life balance (i.e., work-life balance crafting). This paper delves deeper into examining potential factors, namely growth intention and entrepreneurial fear of failure, as underlying work-life balance crafting intentions. Current entrepreneurs recruited via Prolific Academic were employed in this cross-sectional study (N = 177). The results showed that growth intentions significantly and positively predicted entrepreneurs’ intentions to engage in work-life balance crafting behaviors while a non-significant association between entrepreneurial fear of failure and intention to craft work-life balance was found. In addition, exploratory analysis indicated a positive association between growth intentions and entrepreneurial fear of failure. Our findings highlight the positive effect of growth intentions on work-life balance crafting intentions, suggesting that intentions to craft work-life balance more proactively tends to increase when entrepreneurs anticipate that their work-life balance would likely be compromised as a result of business growth pursuit.","['work-life balance, work-life balance crafting intentions, growth intentions, entrepreneurial fear of failure']"

The aim of this study is to gain insight into which factors have a positive influence on the quality of life of people with intellectual disabilities and an intensive support need. The data for this study was obtained through questionnaires completed by carers and by file research. This study looks into the relationship between goals according to the SMART principles and the quality of life of people with ID and an intensive support need. Because not all individual parts of the SMART principle could be statistically tested, the sub-questions have been adjusted. For each goal, it is determined how many of the SMART principles have been achieved. Subsequently, a relationship was sought between the amount of SMART principles and Quality of Life (Schalock & Verdugo, 2018). A distinction has been made between a group with a low level of development and a group with a high level of development. When all SMART principles were formulated for a goal, one significant result was obtained for people with a high level of development in the domain of hysical well-being. Since this is only one result, a type 1 error may have been made here. All other results are not significant. The conclusion of this study is that there is no relationship between the amount of goals and the quality of life of people with ID and an intensive support need. The research shows that the social inclusion of this target group is very low. Based on this study, the following recommendations have been made: follow-up research into other influence on Quality of Life, increase social inclusion and consider who is responsible for setting goals? Should the psychologist be more involved in the assessment of quality of life and the means to enhance this.",

Angst bij kinderen met een Autisme Spectrum Stoornis: de rol van cognitieve flexibiliteit en emotieregulatie.,"Andriessen, Marleen",['Maretha de Jonge'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Bij kinderen met een Autisme Spectrum Stoornis (ASS) wordt vaak een verhoogd niveau van angst gezien. Alhoewel angst een van de grootste klinische problemen lijkt te zijn bij personen met ASS, is er over de oorzaken en risicofactoren relatief nog weinig bekend. Tot nu toe heeft onderzoek zich voornamelijk gericht op volwassenen, adolescenten en kinderen vanaf 6 jaar. Met deze masterscriptie wordt beoogd een bijdrage te leveren aan de literatuur door angst bij kinderen met ASS in de voorschoolse leeftijd in kaart te brengen en de rol die cognitieve flexibiliteit en emotieregulatie hier mogelijk bij spelen te onderzoeken. De participanten bestonden uit 19 kinderen met ASS met een gemiddelde leeftijd van 60 maanden (M=60.21, SD=9.08) en een controlegroep van 43 niet-klinische kinderen met een gemiddelde leeftijd van 56 maanden (M=55.95, SD=11.61). De gezichts- en lichaamsuitdrukkingen van angst zijn gemeten in reactie op een op afstand bestuurbare robot tijdens een experiment. Cognitieve flexibiliteit en emotieregulatie zijn gemeten met de Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Peuters. Kinderen met ASS hadden significant meer problemen met cognitieve flexibiliteit (M=20.16, SD=5.22) dan kinderen uit de niet-klinische controlegroep (M=13.58, SD=3.32). Ook hadden zij significant meer problemen met emotieregulatie (M=18.53, SD=4.23) dan kinderen uit de niet-klinische controlegroep (M=4.47, SD=3.17). Problemen met cognitieve flexibiliteit en emotieregulatie bleken geen significante voorspellers te zijn voor angst bij de ASS-groep, R² = <.001, F(2, 18) = 1.002; p = .389. Het is van belang om al in de voorschoolse leeftijd interventies in te zetten om problematiek rondom emotieregulatie en cognitieve flexibiliteit te reduceren en een negatief beloop te voorkomen of te beperken. Daarnaast is vervolgonderzoek van belang om te onderzoeken of de problemen met cognitieve flexibiliteit en emotieregulatie in de voorschoolse leeftijd wel een voorspeller zijn voor angst op latere leeftijd.","['Autisme Spectrum Stoornis', 'ASS', 'angst', 'cognitieve flexibiliteit', 'emotieregulatie']"

Social behaviour in adolescents with social anxiety: Predicting the underlying motivations of others,"Roering, Lynn","['Ma, I.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Adolescence is a period of many changes, a shift in focus appears from parents to peers. A greater focus on peer relationships can bring many insecurities. Therefore, adolescence is a period of heightened risk for the development of mental health problems. Using economic behavioural games, the social behaviour of others can be predicted by recognising the underlying motivations of others. The underlying motivations researched in this study are greediness and risk aversion. The aim of the study was to learn if social anxiety traits influenced the prediction of the social behaviour of others. It was investigated if a higher level of social anxiety influenced the accuracy of the predictions, based on greedy and risk averse motivations, of participants. In addition, the effects of age and motivation may influence the accuracy of the predictions of participants. No significant results were found during the study. Since the study is conducted with a small sample size, this may have affected the statistical power. Also, participants were not specifically recruited for the requirement of social anxiety. However, the results suggested a relation between age and the number of accurate predictions. Furthermore, the results suggested a relation between the level of social anxiety and motivation. These results should be further investigated in future research. To conclude, this study contributes to a better understanding of social anxiety. The ability of being able to predict when individuals are prosocial or not may prevent the onset of mental health disorders.","['economic behavioural games', 'motivation', 'prediction', 'social anxiety']"

Pyrrhonists believe that by suspending one’s judgments people will achieve tranquillity or a piece of mind (ataraxia). This study measured the suspension of judgment by devising a questionnaire based on the Ten Tropes of Sextus Empiricus and it measured ataraxia by using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD- 7) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). A total number of 213 participants were used in the analysis of the study, aged between 16-70 years. An exploratory factor analysis was performed on the suspension of judgment questionnaire to assess if there were any underlying factors and if it had internal reliability. A simple linear regression and multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the data. The results show that the suspension of judgment can lead to ataraxia but only if anxiety is used as a measure for ataraxia. The results also showed that level of education showed no significant moderation effect. The findings suggest that the suspension of judgment could possibly be helpful as a part of a therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy.",

A prediction condition where they made predictions and a postdiction condition in which the participants, after seeing the correct answer, answered what they would have thought the answer was. The participants also completed a questionnaire to measure their curiosity as a trait. In this study was found that adults overall scored higher than the early adolescents.

"The recovery paradox: (bi-)directional relationships between workload, fatigue and rumination and engagement in physical exercise, moderated by exercise habit","Kooi, Marieke van der","['De Vries, J. & Wolters, F.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Earlier research has shown that certain stressors at work cause strain reactions among employees. Recovering from work to undo these strain reactions is important for employee health. Healthy behaviors can help employees to recover from work and thus reduce these strain reactions, which in turn may help to be better able to cope with work stressors. Paradoxically, research also shows that it is more difficult to engage in healthy behaviors when employees face strain reactions. This study aims to contribute to existing knowledge by investigating the process of the recovery paradox and the reversed recovery process more thoroughly. First, the process of job stressors eliciting strain reactions, which may, in turn, make it more difficult to engage in healthy behaviors will be investigated. Second, the process of healthy behaviors reducing strain reactions, which makes it more likely that stressor at work is perceived as less stressful will be examined. Furthermore, exercise habit will be included as a moderator on both processes. The main results showed nonsignificant results in both processes. The first process outcomes indicate that perceived workload did not predict fewer engagement in sports activities through its increase in fatigue or rumination. The second process outcomes indicate that engagement in sports activities was not related to a change in perceived workload through its decrease in fatigue or rumination. Exercise habit did not moderate both processes, indicating no differences based on the level of engagement in sports activities. Given the limitations of this current study, future research can be done by measuring the concept of workload more extensively to enhance the validity and reliability of this scale by using simple time-lagged relationships between the variables instead of using changes scores. Although existing literature describes workload as a concept with effects on strain and health, we did not find (bi-) directional relationships of the recovery paradox. Practically, this research gives employees and employers insight into employee recovery processes and why it might be difficult to engage in healthy behaviors on a weekly level.","['Recovery Paradox, Job stressors, Workload, Strain Reactions, Rumination, Fatigue, Health Behaviors, Physical Exercise, Exercise Habit']"

The impact of verbal suggestion and conditioning on pain expectancies and pain sensitivity in healthy participants,"Böhler, Christina","['Laarhoven, A.I.M. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Acute pain has the essential function of protecting organisms from harmful influences through painful signals that trigger protective behavioral responses. Chronic pain, however, has merely stress-inducing and disabling characteristics. To enable the development of treatment, understanding the mechanisms underlying pain experience is indispensable. Previous research has demonstrated how expectancy-induced nocebo effects (i.e., the worsening of a symptom caused by negative expectations) can provoke hyperalgesia, an increased sensitivity towards pain. The present study aimed to reproduce these findings and investigate the precise role of expectancies in the relationship between nocebo-inducing cues and the resulting pain experience. Within the context of expectancy, this study was further exploring the degree of awareness involved in the participants’ perception of their accuracy in predicting upcoming pain intensities. Sixty-nine healthy volunteers were divided between the experimental and the control condition, both of which received repeated electrical pain stimulation. Through verbal suggestion and conditioning, the experimental group learned to associate a specific color with high pain intensity and a second color with a medium intensity stimulus. In the control group, there were no instructions and the order of pain intensities and color cues was randomized. During the test phase, all color cues were accompanied by medium intensity pain to measure the magnitude of nocebo responses associated with the conditioned color as opposed to the control color. Pain expectancy and experience, as well as the extent to which they both matched, were measured through self-report scales after each stimulus-color pair. Nocebo conditioning produced the expected higher pain and expectancy ratings for the conditioned cue, as compared to the unconditioned cue in the nocebo group’s test data. Next, expectancies appeared to significantly mediate the effect of the nocebo-induction on pain experience in the experimental group. Finally, there was no significant indication that participants were aware of their degree of prediction accuracy. These findings confirm the significant involvement of expectation in pain experience and warrant further research on awareness in pain perception. Additional research is needed to provide deeper insight on the psychological processes underlying pain experience, as it will help optimize treatments for patients suffering from chronic pain.","['Pain', 'Nocebo', 'Expectancy', 'Conditioning', 'Hyperalgesia']"

Previous research has shown that bipolar disorder patients have different personality trait profiles than healthy individuals. This quantitative study aimed to gain more knowledge about the differences between patients with an early age at onset or a later age at onset. The participants were asked to fill in the NEO-five factor inventory (NEO-ffi) and the severity indices of personality problems -short form (SIPP-sf) to measure five domains of personality traits and five domains of personality functioning. The data of these domains were placed in separate regression models against the age at which bipolar disorder developed. The data from these models showed only a significant Beta value for neuroticism even after correcting for the current mood. This result suggests that there is an association between neuroticism and developing bipolar disorder earlier on in life. No other significant associations were found in this study. The importance of this study is that future research can be done to work on screening programs for these type of risk factors so future cases of bipolar disorder might be prevented.,"['personality traits', 'personality functioning', 'bipolar disorder', 'age at onset']"

Can Parental Perception alter Stress Levels in Parents of Children with Angelman Syndrome? - Investigating the Impact of the Discrepancy between parent-perceived and clinically assessed Child Functioning on Parental Stress and Satisfaction,"Naumann, Renée Christin","['Carolien van Houdt', 'Doesjka Hagenaar']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Layman’s Abstract Objective: Having a child with a disability can bring extra challenges, which can lead to more stress. This is especially the case in families with a child that has Angelman syndrome (AS), a disorder with severe developmental delay, as well as problems with speech, movement, sleep, and behavior. Many studies have focused on how these issues could lead to more stress in parents. This study, however, wants to investigate whether the perception of the parent may influence how stressed they feel. We will, therefore, look at whether the parent views the development of their child differently than the clinician (has a ‘biased view’ on their development). Then we will test whether this ‘biased view’ has an influence on their stress. We expect that the bigger the difference between the two views is, the more stressed they feel and the less satisfied they are about their child’s development. Moreover, patients with AS can be divided into deletion type and non-deletion type patients. This depends on whether the part of the gene that is defective in AS is deleted or does not work for another reason. We expect the effect mentioned before to be stronger for the non-deletion type. Methods: Data was collected in a hospital setting. Physical and psychological measurements were taken from 28 children (15 deletion, 13 non-deletion) at different ages. We used the measurement of a developmental age in months that was evaluated by both a clinician and by the parents with a self-report measure. Also included were self-reported parental stress and satisfaction about their child’s health, and the variables gender, genotype (deletion, non-deletion), age at visit, as well as epilepsy. Results and Conclusion: There was no significant difference between how parents viewed the development of their child versus how the clinician viewed it. Furthermore, this difference between the two views did not make parents feel significantly more stressed or less satisfied with how their child was developing. Future research could use more accurate questionnaires specifically developed to measure parental perceptions and could also look at how parents deal with stressful events in general.","['Angelman Syndrome', 'Parental Stress', 'Parental Perception', 'Child Functioning']"
Social Anxiety and Speech Patterns during Face-To-Face Conversation,"Koenders, Ella","['Chen, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Introduction. Socially anxious individuals express fear or anxiety in circumstances in which others might judge them. It has been suggested that social anxiety affects various voice characteristics, such as pitch and speech intensity, however the relationship between social anxiety and speech patterns has rarely been examined in actual social interactions (face-to-face setting). This study aimed to investigate the relationship between social anxiety and speech patterns, operationalized as pitch and speech intensity; and further assess the influence of social partners’ gaze direction (direct versus averted gaze) on the relationship. Methods. Twenty-six females (Mage = 21) were engaged in a face-to-face getting-acquainted conversation with a female confederate. While in conversation, participants and confederate took turns discussing general topics. The confederate’s gaze direction (direct versus averted) was manipulated. Participants’ social anxiety levels were measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, and Tobii eye-tracking glasses recorded auditory data. Vocal pitch and speech intensity were extracted with PRAAT. Results. The results reveal a significant relationship between social anxiety and speech intensity, whereby high socially anxious individuals spoke more quietly. There was no association between social anxiety and pitch. Confederates’ gaze direction did not influence the relationship between social anxiety and speech patterns. Conclusion. The findings illustrate social anxiety’s effects on speech intensity, regardless of the influence of a social partner’s gaze direction. Moreover, the outcome implies that pitch might be sensitive and closely tied to various situational factors. This underlines the extent of social anxiety’s influence on various human facets and social settings.","['social anxiety', 'speech intensity', 'pitch', 'gaze direction', 'face-to-face conversation']"
Cutting the Knot: Understanding and Preventing Suicidal Ideation: The Moderating Role of Social support: General Self-Efficacy and Suicidal Ideation among Leiden University Students,"Hinz, Annabelle",['Ronald Bahamondes-Álvarez'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper focuses on understanding suicidal ideation via the social determinants of mental health and their mechanisms. The social determinants of mental health are the social or economic context in which people live. It is thought that an increased understanding of the pathways of social determinants is important to improve mental health and thereby minimize the negative impact of suicidality on both society and the economy. Current models of suicidal ideation are mostly focused on psychological constructs, such as feelings of entrapment or defeat. Social determinants are disregarded or only thought to play a minor role. Therefore, a previously hypothesized pathway of social determinants via social support and self-efficacy on suicidal ideation was investigated. Additionally, social support was theorized to act as a moderator for the relationship between generalized self-efficacy and suicidal ideations. This observational cross-sectional study among Leiden University students aged 17-26 years used three previously validated self-report measurements, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Suicidal Ideation Attribution Scale and the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List Short Form. Using hierarchical regression analysis, self-efficacy was shown to predict suicidal ideation. As theorized social support moderated that relationship. In the final model perceived social support explained 7.73 % of the variance. Looking forward, further research among emerging adults is necessary. Additionally, differences in social determinants among domestic and international students should be investigated. Finally, a new ideation-to-action theory from the perspective of the social determinants could help mental health institutions, policymakers, and organizations to cut the knot and decrease suicide rates significantly.","['suicidal ideation, perceived social support, perceived self-efficacy, social determinants of mental health, emerging adults']"
De invloed van psychologische flexibiliteit op mentaal welzijn bij mensen zonder werk gedurende de COVID-19 pandemie.,"Abbing, Gijs","['Koppert, T.Y.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Doelstellingen: Onderzoeken wat de impact van de COVID-19 pandemie was op het mentaal welzijn van mensen zonder betaald werk en onderzoeken of psychologische flexibiliteit in die situatie als buffer op kan treden.

Het zou kunnen dat deze twee factoren elkaar versterken en zorgen voor een groot verlies van mentaal welzijn voor mensen zonder werk tijdens de pandemie. Psychologische flexibiliteit is een theoretisch concept wat mensen helpt zich aan te passen aan nieuwe situaties en zo als buffer op kan treden. Wellicht dat dit ook optrad bij mensen zonder betaald werk tijdens de pandemie. Methoden: Er zijn in de jaren 2018, 2020, 2021 en 2022 online vragenlijsten afgenomen bij participanten (n = 6050). Deze vragenlijst bestond uit een aantal demografische vragen, de SF-36 om mentaal welzijn te meten en de FIT-18 om psychologische flexibiliteit te meten. Resultaten: Mentaal welzijn verschilde niet tussen de prepandemie en de peripandemie (β = 0.02, p = 0.448), maar wel tussen de peripandemie en de postpandemie (β = 0.11, p < 0.001).

Conclusie: Mensen zonder betaald werk hadden consequent een lager mentaal welzijn als mensen met betaald werk. Er was echter geen duidelijk verlies van mentaal welzijn te zien bij mensen zonder betaald werk tijdens de pandemie ten opzichte van daarvoor. Psychologische flexibiliteit kon wel als buffer optreden tegen de gevolgen van werkloosheid, maar werkte niet als buffer tegen de gevolgen van de pandemie.","['COVID-19, psychologische flexibiliteit, mentaal welzijn, werkloosheid']"
Dual Dot Probe Taak voor automatische aandacht voor dreiging: En de relatie met angst en aandachtcontrole en inzicht in de betrouwbaarheid van de taak,"Maas, Astrid","['Putman, P.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In this study we tried to replicate the previously found relation between attentional bias to threat and trait-anxiety (measured with the Spielberger’s State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), using the Dual Dot Probe Task. The relationship between attentional bias and attentional control (measured with the Derryberry & Reed’s Trait attentional Control Scale) was also studied. Individual differences in attentional control could moderate the threat level of the attentional bias, more attentional control could lead to a better reaction to different experienced threat levels. In this study there is also attention for the effects of different threat levels (mild and high). According to Mogg and Bradley’s Model (1998) people adjust themselves when the threat level changes. According to this model people with low anxiety direct no attention to mild threatening stimuli, but do direct attention to high threatening stimuli. People with high anxiety are expected to direct more attention to mild threatening stimuli en show avoidance for high threatening stimuli. The results in this study show no attentional bias for high or mild threat within the sample. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the Dual Dot Probe Task was also studied, both of them were found to be very high. Further research will have to show whether an attentional bias to threat will be found with a shorter cure target delay (shorter than 500ms), and if the very high reliability of the Dual Dot Probe Task can be replicated.","['Aandacht bias, aandacht controle, dual dot probe taak, angst']"
Graag uw aandacht voor de nieuwe dot probe taak: Aandachtsbias naar milde en/of hoge dreiging en de invloed van aandachtscontrole,"Heutinck, Eva","['Putman, P.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Aandachtscontrole (AC) wordt gerapporteerd van invloed te zijn op de aandachtsbias (attentional bias; AB) dat een invidiu heeft naar milde en hoge dreiging. Het blijkt dat een hoge AC gerelateerd is aan minder aandacht richting milde dreiging en meer aandacht richting hoge dreiging, en een lage AC verband houdt met meer aandacht richting milde dreiging en minder aandacht richting hoge dreiging. AC werd gemeten door de 56 deelnemende participanten de Attentional Control Scale (ACS) vragenlijst te laten invullen. Tot op heden werd AB gemeten een dot probe taak. In het huidige onderzoek werd een nieuwe dot probe taak, genaamd dual probe taak, gebruikt. Participanten kregen neutrale, mild dreigende of hoog dreigende stimuli te zien en werden gevraagd te rapporteren welke stimuli zij het duidelijkst waarnamen. Resultaten lieten geen significante AB naar zowel milde als hoge dreiging zien. Ook werden er geen significante correlaties gevonden tussen AC en AB voor respectievelijk milde en hoge dreiging. De hoge interne consistentie van de taak is opvallend. Het suggereert dat de taak zelf betrouwbaar is, maar wellicht een ander construct meet dan gewenst is voor dit onderzoek. Verder wordt geconcludeerd dat het cue-target delay gebruikt in deze studie (500 ms) mogelijk te lang is om het effect van AB accuraat te kunnen meten.",
Gender Differences in the Relationship Between Childhood Emotional Abuse and Perpetration of Psychological Partner Violence,"Nolst Trenité, Maud","['Krause-Utz, A.', 'Reinken, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Child abuse has been associated with adverse outcomes later in life, one of which is perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV). The two have previously been linked, but most of this research focuses either on sexual or physical abuse or on perpetration of IPV in men. The present study investigated the relationship between childhood emotional abuse and perpetration of psychological IPV. Additionally, by means of a moderation analysis, it was investigated whether this relationship was stronger in men. The analysis was executed twice, once with n = 396 participants including outliers, and once with n = 381 participants which excluded outliers. Results from both models indicated a significant main effect (p Model 1 = <.001; p Model 2 = .015), in line with previous research on childhood abuse and IPV. The second hypothesis was rejected, meaning the effect was not bigger in men (p Model 1 = .626; p Model 2 = .725). Rejection of this hypothesis could be explained by the aforementioned fact that literature on perpetration of IPV focuses mainly on men, which is why the moderation effect expected to be bigger. There is only a small amount of research focusing on both genders and on the specific constructs researched here. Therefore, more research needs to be done to ensure conclusive results.",

Current research examined the relation between fathers’ gendered expectations on their sons’ and daughters’ feminine and masculine occupational aspirations, and the role of the children’s gender-stereotypical beliefs in this relation. The resulting research question concerned: To what extent are the father’s gender-stereotypical expectations of professions related to his children’s gender-stereotypical occupational aspirations, and to what extent do his children’s gender-stereotypical beliefs about sciences mediate this relation? This question was expected to be answered by examining a sample of 100 Dutch families. Two children from each family, one aged 15 and one aged 17, participated and were asked to complete the OAT-PM and the IAT. The OAT-AM was administered to their fathers. The results showed no relations between either the father’s gender-stereotypical expectations of professions and his children’s gender-stereotypical beliefs about sciences, nor between the children’s gender-stereotypical beliefs about sciences and their own gender-stereotypical occupational aspirations. However, it was found that the adolescent daughter’s masculine occupational aspirations were higher when their father had less gender-stereotypical ideas about professions. It was concluded that future research should explore the relation between the father’s implicit gender stereotypes and his children’s gender-stereotypical occupational aspirations further in other social-cultural contexts, and examine the role of explicit gender stereotypes of the child as a mediator in this relation.","['children’s occupational aspirations', 'father’s gender-stereotypical expectations of professions', 'children’s stereotypical beliefs about sciences', 'gender stereotypes']"
"The effect of physical exercise, moderated by gender, on people’s level of depressive symptoms.","Krommedijk, Tess","['Debin, T.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"With depression being the leading cause of impairment worldwide and traditional therapies lacking efficacy, a growing number of studies are focusing on the effect of physical exercise (PE) on people’s mental health. Most studies suggest a negative association between the amount of exercise and the level of depressed symptoms; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Moreover, it appears that gender differences are not sufficiently taken into account, as women are more susceptible to depression than men, yet engage in lower levels of PE. This thesis examined the effect of PE, moderated by gender, on people's level of depressive symptoms. After performing a multiple regression analysis, no significant effect of gender as a moderator for the relationship between physical activity and depressive symptoms has been found. According to our results, males did not show higher levels of overall physical activity than females, nor did females show higher levels of depressive symptoms. Future studies aiming for a better understanding of these underlying mechanisms are therefore highly necessary.",

The present study investigates the role of affinity with, and likeability of, the nonprofit organization, altruism and empathy in the willingness to donate time and effort to the nonprofit organization, referred to as different types of volunteerism. In a cross-sectional survey study, a sample of 143 members of the general public completed the self-report questionnaire of the research via the online crowdsourcing service Prolific (N = 143). Results of multiple regression analysis indicated that affinity with the nonprofit organization, when controlled for altruism, predicted likeability of the nonprofit organization and willingness to volunteer for the nonprofit organization. Furthermore, altruism, when controlled for affinity with the nonprofit organization, predicted empathy. Mediation analysis revealed that likeability of the nonprofit organization mediated the relationship between affinity with the nonprofit organization and willingness to volunteer for the nonprofit organization. Unexpectedly, empathy did not significantly mediate the relationship between altruism and willingness to volunteer for the nonprofit organization. Finally, moderation analysis showed that altruism did not significantly strengthen the relationship between affinity with the nonprofit organization and likeability of the nonprofit organization. The findings provide support for the hypothesized relationship between affinity with the nonprofit organization, likeability with the nonprofit organization, and willingness to volunteer for the nonprofit organizations.

SVO and Rising Costs in a Volunteer’s Dilemma,"Assaban, Nisrine",['Erik de Kwaadsteniet'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In this article the effects of SVO and rising costs in different volunteer dilemmas are examined. There is a distinction made between prosocials and proselfs in three different conditions of a VOD (normal VOD, VOD with rising costs for the volunteer and VOD with rising costs for the group). In this study there were 150 participants of which 75 males, 72 females and 3 unknown Participants had to do a SVO slider task to determine their SVO. After that, the participants were assigned to a group of five participants in one of the three conditions. In control condition, participants participated in a normal VOD in which volunteering cost £0.75. The group bonus was £8, when someone volunteers. In the condition with rising costs for volunteer, the costs of volunteering increased every 5 seconds with £0.15. In the condition with rising costs (decreasing benefits) for the group, the bonus decreased with £0.75 every 5 seconds. They had to decide whether they wanted to volunteer or not. A Binary Logistic Regression has been conducted, with one dependent variable (choice to volunteer) and two independent variables (SVO & condition). A significant effect of SVO was found: prosocials volunteered more than proselfs. Furthermore, a significant difference was found between the normal VOD and the VOD with increasing costs for the volunteer. Participant in the VOD with increasing costs for the volunteer, volunteered less than in a normal VOD. A marginally significant difference was found between the normal VOD and the VOD with increasing costs for the group, indicating that participants in the volunteer less in this condition than in the control condition.",

Preventief Interventie Team,"Janssen, Eva",['Stephan Huijbregts'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Objective: The goal of this research was to describe the intellectual and social capacities of children with externalizing behavior problems, who are at risk of developing criminal behavior. Externalizing behavior problems, low cognitive-social skills and low intelligence have been found as a risk factor for criminal behavior. However, only few studies have examined these factors for children who show externalizing behavior problems and are at risk for developing criminal behavior. Method: The high-risk children were recruited through an early identification and intervention project of the city of Amsterdam (N=188, 80.3% boys). The control group was recruited from children who attend the same schools as the high-risk children (N=43, 74.4% boys). Children included in the research were 7- to 12-years-old. To measure their externalizing behavior problems, teachers were asked to fill out a form (TRF). During a screening, children were asked questions about stories to measure social-cognitive skills. Intelligence was measured with the WISC-III. Results: A negative, weak association was found between intelligence and externalizing behavior problems. A positive, moderate association was found between intelligence and social-cognitive skills. No mediation effect of social-cognitive skills on the associations between intelligence and externalizing behavior problems was found. Conclusions: In developing and identifying interventions for children who have externalizing behavior problems, it is important to take their intellectual and social capacities in mind. The implications for early intervention for children who are at risk of developing criminal behavior are discussed.","['Intelligence', 'Externalizing behavior problems', 'Social-cognitive skills', 'Preventive invervention', 'Criminal behavior']"

Does perceptual sensitivity influence the relation between parental sensitiveness and donating prosocial behaviour in middle childhood?,"Barra Larrondo, Belén",['Simone Dobbelaar'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social competence is important for engaging in meaningful interactions with other people. An important aspect of social competence is prosocial behaviour. Some prosocial behaviours can be costly and by showing sensitivity in their parent-child interaction, children learn and adopt behaviour from their parents. Therefore, we investigated the relation between parental sensitivity and costly prosocial behaviour because parents might influence their children's prosocial behaviour. Moreover, differential susceptibility markers such as the temperamental trait perceptual sensitivity contribute to responding to environmental cues. Therefore, we investigated whether perceptual sensitivity had a moderation effect on the relation between parental sensitivity and costly prosocial behaviour in terms of donation in middle childhood. This study focused on this developmental period because it is an important, transitional stage of children’s development. This study is cross-sectional and our sample consisted of participants (N=216) aged 7-9 that were part of a larger experimental cohort-sequential longitudinal twin study (L-CID). Parental sensitivity was measured with an observational task in which parent-child interaction was observed during a structured situation. A donation task was performed to assess the amount of money that children donate after watching a charity video. Self-report measures were used to access the temperament trait in terms of perceptual sensitivity. Firstly, we hypothesized that there was a positive relation between parental sensitivity and costly prosocial behaviour. After performing a regression analysis, we found no relation within our sample. Secondly, we also hypothesized that perceptual sensitivity moderated the relation between parental sensitivity and costly prosocial behaviour. However, after performing moderation analysis, there was found no interaction effects between our constructs. Our findings indicate that there is not a direct association in how the level of sensitivity in parents influences their children donating behaviour but that other factors such as individual characteristics or environmental factors might be further researched in order to know predictors of costly prosocial behaviour in middle childhood.","['parental sensitivity', 'perceptual sensitivity', 'costly prosocial behaviour', 'donating behaviour', 'middle childhood']"

We hypothesise that homosexual entrepreneurs receive lower evaluations than heterosexual entrepreneurs in a male-typed business, and that homosexual entrepreneurs receive lower evaluations in a male than female-typed business. We conducted a vignette study (N = 200) designed as a 2 (sexual orientation: homosexual vs. heterosexual) x 2 (gender-typed business: female-type field vs. male-type field) cross-sectional, between-subjects experiment with participants recruited from Prolific Academic. Both hypotheses were not supported, suggesting that the context of the entrepreneur, acceptance towards sexual minorities, possession of masculine and feminine traits, and performance may play a bigger role in performance trust than the stereotypes associated with them.","['sexual orientation, gender-typed business, performance trust, stereotypes, perceived incongruence']"

Influencing Stress Reactivity by Verbal Suggestions: Effects of Manipulating Stress Response Expectancies on Cortisol Reactivity to Acute Stress and Attentional Bias in Relation to Neuroticism and Stress Mindset,"Slutter, Leanne",['Dr. Henriët van Middendorp'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Negative health effects of frequent stress responses are partly caused by the role of negative expectations about stress. Placebo and nocebo effects affect physiological outcomes through expectancies that can be elicited by verbal suggestions. Limited studies investigated this for the immune parameter cortisol. This study investigated whether verbal suggestions on one’s stress sensitivity affect cortisol reactivity and attentional bias for threat-related stimuli to acute stress, and how cortisol reactivity is related to neuroticism and stress mindset. To test this aim, one-hundred and twenty healthy participants (M = 21.3 years) completed questionnaires on neuroticism and stress mindset and were randomized to one of three conditions regarding one’s stress-sensitivity profile: positive (n = 41) or negative verbal suggestions (n = 42), or no suggestions (n = 41). Afterwards, the Trier Social Stress Test assessed cortisol reactivity to acute stress and the emotional Stroop task measured attentional bias to threat-related stimuli. Salivary cortisol was measured on four times throughout the experiment. Manipulation checks demonstrated that verbal suggestions on one’s stress-sensitivity profile did not appear convincing enough to manipulate one’s expectancies to acute stress reactivity. Repeated measures ANOVA did not show a significant difference between conditions in cortisol reactivity (p = .940). ANOVA did not reveal a significant effect of condition on threat-related attentional bias (p = .557). Stress mindset did not predict cortisol reactivity to stress (p = .215), whereas a higher level of neuroticism was related to attenuated cortisol reactivity (β = -.232, p = .014). Moderation analyses did not show that condition impacted the association of neuroticism (p = .455) or stress mindset (p = .825) with cortisol reactivity. Study conclusions are limited by the insufficiently effective verbal suggestions. Further research is recommended to investigate whether different verbal suggestions, such as examples relatable to upcoming stress tasks or framing with statistical information can affect cortisol reactivity to acute stress and attentional bias. With more effective stress profile manipulations, future research could provide more convincing evidence of a potential impact of verbal suggestions on cortisol reactivity to acute stress, attentional bias and the role of individual difference characteristics in that association.","['Stress, Threat-related attentional bias, Cortisol, Expectancy, Placebo, Nocebo, Stress mindset, Neuroticism']"
Indigenous Prevalence Against Extractives in Costa Rica: The Case of The Hydroelectric Diquís Project,"Carr-Brulard, Sophie",['Dr. Gomez Uribe'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The rise in ecological concerns and degradation motivates the pursuit of renewable energy production in tackling climate change. Despite the sustainable framing of hydroelectric projects, they often constitute a source of conflict and resistance for marginalized communities. However, the success of anti-dam movements and resistance does not typically prevail. This study explains how the Térraba community’s resistance prevailed in cancelling the hydroelectric Diquís Project in Costa Rica. Political Ecology serves to uncover the power relations between the State and the indigenous within the discursive clash on development projects. A discourse analysis reveals opposing perspectives on development between the State and the indigenous, and its contribution to cancelling the largest dam project in Central America. The findings illustrate how a discursive clash of extractivist perspectives and practices allowed indigenous communities to utilize the legal framework to further their discourse and demand the cancellation of a harmful project.",

Demographic questions were answered regarding gender and age. To assess motivation questions were asked based on the Test-Taking Motivation Questionnaire (Eklöf, 2006). To measure sports activity, several questions were compiled. To determine performance the distance between the mouse to the cursor was measured in absolute difference in pixels. The Spearman’s Rho was conducted to determine if motivation and sporting activity were predictors of performance. A Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to explore a possible association between sporting activity and performance. Level of sporting activity and motivational level are non-significant predictors of performance on a complex visuo-motor task. In addition, sporting activity is not significantly associated with motivation. Since modern professions require the mastery of complex motor functions further research on the predictors of complex motor skills is recommended.",
Defining 'Replication' in Psychology: Which definitions exist and do they correspond?,"Clemens, Julia","[""Veer, A.E. van 't""]",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this thesis, we looked for an all-encompassing definition for ‘replication’ in the psychology. Replication studies are rarely performed within psychology, even though it is an important method to become more certain about the reliability of existing claims. One of the reasons of this problem could lie with the multiple definitions of ‘replication' used by researchers. To examine how this word is defined in psychology, we drew up a database using a keyword profile search in WOS. From this database we filtered papers that use a definition for ‘replication’. We analyzed this data qualitatively and quantitatively. The qualitative part consisted of assigning ingredients to the found definitions in order to decide which definition contained the most common ingredients or with the highest number of ingredients respectively. The quantitative part consisted of visualizing the citations over time to show how the papers and the definitions are used in psychology to track scientific impact. A combination of the two definitions chosen provides a comprehensive description of what ‘replication’ actually means, does and delivers. We expect that a combination of these two definitions serves as a basis and may bring researchers in line when it comes to replication, which will likely aid in future study methodology","['Replication, ingredients, definition, citation, psychology']"
The influence of a perceived lack of social support after the experience of a traumatic event on PTSD and depression at 15 years post-trauma,"Brinkman, Julia",['Joanna Mouthaan'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Background: Previous research has identified a perceived lack of social support after a traumatic event and female gender as risk factors for the development of PTSD and depression up to 40 months after the experience of the event. Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether a perceived lack of social support in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event predicts PTSD and depressive symptoms at 15 years post-trauma, and whether gender moderates these relationships. Subsequently, the associations between a lack of various subtypes of social support and PTSD and depressive symptoms at 15 years were investigated. Method: This study contained N=88 participants, all being part of the cohort of a multicenter prospective cohort study consisting of N=852 suspected serious injury victims. The perceived lack of social support was measured using the SSL-D questionnaire, the PTSD scores with the CAPS-5 and the depressive scores with the QIDS. The research questions were answered by carrying out stepwise multivariate linear regression analyses. Results: Early perceived lack of social support did not predict 15-year PTSD and depression symptoms in the whole sample. Male gender moderated the relationship between the perceived lack of social support shortly after trauma and PTSD symptoms at 15 years. Finally, people who perceived more lack of informative social support, had more depressive symptoms at 15 years. Discussion: These findings indicated that the known predictors for PTSD and depression up to 40 months were not in the same way related to PTSD and depression at 15 years. Future research is required, in which a wider range of participants is advised.","['Keywords: Perceived lack of social support, PTSD, depression, gender, subtypes of social support, social causation model, stress-buffering theor']"
Examining the association between the facets underlying Trait Mindfulness and Empathy among psychology students,"Everts, René","['Middendorp, H.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the relationship between Trait Mindfulness facets and Empathy facets in a sample of Dutch students in higher education. This is the first study to date that builds on recommendations in the existing literature by examining the relationship between Trait Mindfulness and Empathy facets whilst considering the potentially relevant variables of age, sex, being an aspirant therapist and meditation experience. The Five-Facet-Mindfulness-Questionnaire and Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) were filled out by a convenience sample of 156 students (69.9% female). This thesis is part of a broader research project, and four more questionnaires were administered assessing various psychological variables. No significant correlation was found between the overarching scores of Trait Mindfulness and Empathy (p = .447). Higher scores on the mindfulness facet Observing were significantly related to higher scores on the empathy facets Perspective Taking and Fantasy, and overall Empathy (r-values ≥ .27; p-values ≤ .001). Higher scores on the mindfulness facet Describing were significantly related to higher scores on Perspective Taking and Fantasy, and lower scores on Personal distress (r-values ≥ .19; p-values ≤ .005). Higher scores on the mindfulness facet Non-Reacting were significantly related to lower scores on Fantasy, Empathic Concern, Personal Distress, and overall Empathy (r-values ≥ .24; p-values ≤ .001). Being older was only related to lower scores on the Empathy facet Fantasy (β= -.296, p = .010), and having the aspiration of becoming a therapist after graduation was significantly related to lower scores on Empathy (β= -.170, p = .016), but not on any of its underlying facets. Neither Acting with Awareness nor Non-Judging were found to be significant predictors of any Empathy facets (p-values ≥.110). Lastly, Meditation Experience was found not to significantly predict Empathy or any of its underlying facets (p-values ≥.287). These findings demonstrate that the relationship between Trait Mindfulness and Empathy emerges when examined on the facet level, but not on the overarching composite level. This highlights the relevance of investigating the relationship between Trait Mindfulness and Empathy accordingly in future research.","['trait mindfulness', 'dispositional mindfulness', 'empathy', 'empathic tendencies', 'five facet mindfulness questionnaire', 'FFMQ', 'interpersonal reactivity index', 'IRI', 'hierarchical regression', 'clinical therapist', 'meditation experience']"
"Morality, sociability and reality: third party judgements of outgroup helping","Sikkenga, Jessica","['Leeuwen, E. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Outgroup helping serves various strategic motives, for example to communicate ingroup warmth and competence. However, unsolicited help is not always beneficial for the recipient, as it could cause feelings of inferiority and incompetence. Furthermore, it is not always judged positively by third party observers. This study investigated how third party observers judge outgroup helping with a motive to appear either moral or social. Based on literature on moral hypocrisy and tainted altruism, it was expected that help providers with a strategic motive to appear moral would be judged more negatively compared to help providers with a strategic motive to appear social. A scenario experiment was conducted, in which participants (N = 209) read a scenario in which the motive to offer help (e.g. to appear moral or social) and whether this was in line with whom they really are (reality congruence) was manipulated. The results confirmed that participants judged the help providers more negatively when the motive to provide help was incongruent with how they really are. However, unexpectedly, help providers who helped an outgroup in order to present themselves as being moral, were not judged more negatively compared to help providers who helped outgroup members in order to appear social. These results are at odds with literature on moral hypocrisy, which describes that it would be perceived as hypocrite when one would lie about being moral, because morality comprises traits such as honesty and integrity. The results suggest that morality and sociability are not as independent as previously thought.","['outgroup helping', 'sociability', 'morality', 'reputation enhancement']"

This results in a strong relationship between voting for the party and ethnic background. Furthermore, fifteen semi-structured interviews with BIJ1 voters and people who have considered voting for the party. These were used to examine the reasons behind voting for BIJ1 along the three dimensions in Dutch politics: namely the socioeconomic, cultural and moral dimensions. The socio-economic and cultural dimensions proved to be paramount to BIJ1 supporters. Although BIJ1 voters and non-voters mentioned reasons that fell within the three dimensions these categories seem to provide incomplete explanations in connection to other issues that were discussed. The results of the interviews with BIJ1 voters, as well as non-voters, have demonstrated that their reasons for voting and considering the party were predominantly connected to identity. The group of voters who considered voting for BIJ1 were often held back by the identity of the party and did not identify with these issues as deeply as BIJ1 voters did.","['BIJ1', 'ethnic-minorities', 'voting', 'migration background', 'identity']"

Synesthesia Training as a Language Acquisition Tool: Can pseudo-synesthesia help you learn similar alphabets faster than dissimilar alphabets?,"Nicolescu, Ana-Maria","['Root, N.B.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which certain stimuli trigger automatic sensations. Having synesthesia is linked to enhanced memory and language acquisition. Grapheme-color synesthesia is relatively rare: 1.5% of the population experiences letters in colors. However, recent evidence suggests that synesthesia can also be acquired through training (pseudo-synesthesia). It is an open question whether the benefits to language learning seen in synesthesia also apply to pseudo-synesthetes. As part of a larger study testing the effectiveness of synesthesia training for L2 learning, this paper strives to answer the novel question of whether the training is more beneficial for learning certain languages: either a similar (Greek) or a dissimilar alphabet (Arabic). In the current study, Native Dutch participants were trained to make letter-color associations for a subset of Latin graphemes and were afterward taught Greek or Arabic letters and their pronunciations through tasks with feedback. Some L2 letters could be linked via shape or sound to a Dutch letter that was trained in synesthetic color (“transfer possible”), whereas others were linked to a Dutch letter associated with no color (“transfer impossible”). Synesthesia training improved language learning if the L2 letters in the “transfer possible” condition were learned more quickly than those in the “transfer impossible” condition. The results suggest that synesthesia training improves language learning, but contrary to the initial prediction, it helped the participants who learned Arabic more than the ones who learned Greek. Possible reasons for this difference are discussed, and it is concluded that further research is needed. Can we then assume that similar alphabets are indeed not learned faster than dissimilar ones after being trained in pseudo-synesthesia?","['synesthesia', 'language acquisition', 'pseudo-synesthesia']"
"Een kwestie van mentaal welzijn of psychologische flexibiliteit? Onderzoek naar het mentaal welzijn van mensen met en zonder een cardiovasculaire ziekte, tijdens en na de coronapandemie en de rol van psychologische flexibiliteit.","Tempel, Carlijn","['Koppert, T.Y.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Nederland ging op 13 maart 2020 in een lockdown in vanwege de intrede van COVID-19. Mensen met een cardiovasculaire ziekte ervaren stress rondom het krijgen van een besmetting met het virus, wegens de consequenties van besmetting voor deze groep en de uitgestelde zorg. Er is echter nog weinig onderzoek gedaan naar het mentaal welzijn van deze groep ten tijde van en na de pandemie. Zo lijkt psychologische flexibiliteit een rol te spelen bij mensen met een chronische ziekte ten tijde van de pandemie. In dit onderzoek is er onderzocht of er een verschil in mentaal welzijn is tijdens en na de pandemie voor mensen met en zonder cardiovasculaire ziekte, en of psychologische flexibiliteit hierbij een beschermende rol speelt. Dit is gemeten door middel van zelfrapportage vragenlijsten bij 6050 respondenten tussen de 16 en 99 jaar. Uit de regressieanalyse is gebleken dat met name mensen zonder cardiovasculaire ziekten zich na de pandemie mentaal beter voelen, in vergelijking met mensen met een cardiovasculaire ziekte. Echter is er geen significantie aangetoond voor psychologische flexibiliteit, wat erop duidt dat dit geen beschermende factor is. Vervolgonderzoek zou moeten aantonen welke chronische condities daadwerkelijk voordelen ervaren een hoge psychologische flexibiliteit en welke overlap psychologische flexibiliteit met mentaal welzijn heeft. The Netherlands entered a lockdown on March 13, 2020, due to COVID-19. People with a cardiovascular disease experienced stress around getting an infection, due to the consequences of the virus, and the delayed care for their illness. However, little research has been done for this group during and after the pandemic. For example, psychological flexibility seems to play a role in people with a chronic illness during the pandemic. This study investigated whether there is a difference in mental well-being during and after the pandemic, for people with and without cardiovascular disease, and whether psychological flexibility plays a protective role. This was measured by means of self-report questionnaires among 6050 respondents between the ages of 16 and 99. The regression analysis showed that especially people without a cardiovascular disease have a higher mental wellbeing after the pandemic, compared to people with cardiovascular disease. However, no significance has been shown for psychological flexibility, suggesting that this is not a protective factor. Follow-up research should show which chronic conditions benefit from a higher psychological flexibility.","['cardiovascular disease', 'COVID-19', 'psychological flexibility', 'mental wellbeing', 'stress']"

THE EFFECT OF OTHERS’ GAZE DIRECTION ON OBSERVERS’ OWN GAZE BEHAVIOR DURING FACE-TO-FACE CONVERSATIONS: THE INFLUENCE OF A SOCIAL PARTNERS’ GAZE ON EYE GAZE BEHAVIOR,"El Bouk, Hanna",['Jiemiao Chen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Humans have a tendency to look at the eye region when viewing a face. In addition, previous research suggests that allocation of the gaze depends on which facial feature provides the necessary information. In the present study, these two insights are combined. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of others’ gaze direction on observers’ own gaze behavior during a real-world conversation. To this end, 34 participants (82% female) completed a face-to-face getting-acquainted conversation with a same-sex confederate, while their eye movements were tracked using Tobii eye-tracking glasses throughout. The confederate’s gaze direction (direct vs. averted gaze) was manipulated. Two regions of interest (ROIs) - the eyes and mouth of the confederate – were chosen. Two eye-tracking measures – total fixation duration and proportion of fixations - were analyzed. The results reveal that participants exhibited increased gaze to the eyes (vs. mouth region) of the confederate during conversations. Moreover, the effects of confederate gaze direction were observed, specifically, when the confederate’s gaze was averted, participants looked less at the eyes while attending to the mouth more frequently during the conversation. Altogether, this research confirms the visual preference for the eyes in a real-world social interaction, and further implies that the allocation of the gaze may depend on which facial feature provides the necessary information","['direct, averted, gaze']"
