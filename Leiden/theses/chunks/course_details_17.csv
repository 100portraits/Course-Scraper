Attention and Memory Encoding Skills: Cognitive Improvements after Experiencing (Childhood) Financial Scarcity,"Teubel, Roos","['Ruigendijk, H.', 'Bommel, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Growing up in financial scarcity can have a destructive influence on someone’s cognition, effects that could even last into adulthood. However, some studies about childhood scarcity show that in specific situations cognitive improvements of attention and memory encoding may occur. Based on the life history theory, we proposed that people who experienced childhood scarcity are better able to adapt to a comparable situation, such as experiencing financial scarcity again, and, thus, outperform those who did not experience childhood scarcity on attention and memory encoding skills. We also expected that people who experienced childhood scarcity but are not currently feeling financially scarce will perform worse on attention and memory encoding compared to people who did not experience childhood scarcity. Our hypotheses were tested in an experimental setting in which people were instructed to order food online from a menu. Current financial scarcity was manipulated by randomly assigning half of the participants to a low budget ($12.50) and the other half to a high budget ($100). The findings suggest that childhood scarcity can enhance memory encoding for prices and calories from the menu, regardless of current feelings of financial scarcity. Furthermore, current financial scarcity causes people to make fewer mistakes when remembering prices but also to remember fewer dishes. Accordingly, although our findings do not support the expected adaptational effect, it does show that people who grew up in financial scarcity or are in current financial scarcity can outperform those who experienced less (childhood) financial scarcity.",

Establishing a common metric for anxiety symptoms,"Korenjugin, Timofei","['de Beurs, E.', 'Fried, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The growth and development of psychology and mental healthcare is accompanied by a rapid increase in the number of assessment instruments that are utilizer. The downside of presented variety and availability is an abundance, which hinders interpretation of test results, comparison of outcomes, and communication among colleagues and with patients about their test results. This may lead to diminished patient involvement and treatment progress. A common metric is lacking, linking test scores to a common metric, such as the T-score metric based on the Item Response Theory (IRT), may provide a solution to the Babel tower dilemma. The current study investigates the feasibility of an approach to develop a common metric and applies this to three anxiety-related questionnaires: Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ), Bodily Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ), and Mobility Inventory (MI) based on the data collected from 210 patients and 430 normal participants. IRT was applied to attain T-scores, form non-linear transformation formulas to estimate T-scores based on raw test scores and theory-based T-scores. The distributions and correspondence of the two Tscores were inspected. The theory-based T-scores and T-scores based on transformation formulas correspond sufficiently for ACQ and BSQ, but for the MI the proposed approach failed to produce useable T-scores. The reasons, pros and cons of IRT are discussed, as well as practical applications, focusing the attention on Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM). The use of a common metric will allow ease comparison of scores from various instruments and aids communication, while characteristics of IRT allow the use of variable questionnaires and adaptive tailored testing assisting the utilization of ROM in treatment.","['ACQ', 'BSQ', 'MI', 'linking', 'IRT', 'common metric', 'ROM']"

An analysis into the strategic motives of China, Iran and Russia in the cyberspace","Keulen, Jedidja van","['Willigen, N. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Nation-states are increasingly making use of the cyberspace to conduct hostile cyberoperations. To date, scholars have highlighted why the cyberspace offers a unique and advantageous new battleground for states, but fail to provide a unified theoretical explanation on how and why states employ the new cyberdomain in their war toolbox. This study aims to contribute to answer part of the “why” states want to make use of the cyberspace; by explaining why differences exist between the adopted strategic motives of China, Iran and Russia in the cyberspace. To investigate this, the foreign policy goals of these nation-states were identified first. Then, by analyzing 243 cyberattacks and classifying the attacks in an own built database, it was tested which strategic motive underlays a nation-state more compared to the other motives. It is found that China is mostly preoccupied with stealing confidential records and theft of intellectual property, to boost its innovation-based economy and exert unwarranted influence over other countries. Iran does not follow a specific strategic motive since many cyberattacks fail, and thus the true strategic motive remains unclear. Lastly, Russia uses the cyberspace to manipulate by spreading disinformation or influence elections, to boost its position as regional power and reinstalling its position as world power.",
"The relationship between clinical complexity, treatment dose and outcome in patients with anxiety disorder in everyday clinical practice: Empirical study","Wigmann, Duncan","['Beurs, E. de', 'Rover, M. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Recent research has only shown little evidence for a relationship between patient characteristics and treatment outcome. It is proposed that patients with a higher need of Mental Health Care due to higher psychopathologic complexity receive more treatment compared to others to reach a comparatively good treatment result. The treatment dose in more complex patients might therefore be significantly higher than in less complex patients. According to that, treatment dose should mediate the relationship between complexity and outcome. Thereby, the main purpose of this study is the investigation of a proposed mediation effect by treatment dose, operationalized as treatment duration in minutes and treatment length in days. Clinical Complexity was based on the degree of psychopathological severity and treatment outcome was measured with the self-report questionnaire Outcome Questionnaire-45. This investigation is based on a sample of patients in ambulatory treatment, who suffer from anxiety disorders, originated from the GGZ institution Arkin, an MHC provider in the Netherlands. Finally, no mediation effect has been shown and no evidence for an existent triadic relationship between complexity, outcome and treatment dose has been found. Besides, treatment duration correlated positively with complexity. Patients with higher complexity also tend to have a less favorable treatment outcome compared with patients of lower complexity. The results of this study should be interpreted and dealt with caution due to potential threats to internal and external validity. In future research alternative complexity and treatment dose indicators need further investigation to assess the prognostic value of patient characteristics for treatment outcome.",

It is found that the counterinsurgency in Kashmir qualifies as people-centric to a large extent with attention given to people’s needs by conducting elections, addressing root causes of insurgencies, gaining legitimacy through provision of incentives and securing civilians through use of force. It is also found that the conduction of elections which is deemed as a successful people-centric strategy to gain legitimacy only applies to certain extent in Kashmir as the discontentment still prevails with demands of more autonomy. This research further explores the paradox of use of force in a people-centric approach with the human right violation claims on the army. By applying a theory based on Western experiences, this paper helps gain theoretical insights and lessons from the Indian counterinsurgency campaign, hence adding to the literature on irregular warfare.",
How Private Solutions Increase Inequality,"Veistola, Sonja","['Gross, J.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Humans regularly face collective problems calling for cooperation. To solve such problems, people can establish public goods that require contributions from individual members and benefit the whole group, e.g. public health care and infrastructure. It has been suggested that in modern society people have become less dependent on the creation of public goods and more able to solve problems individually (Santos, Varnum, & Grossmann, 2017). Nevertheless, solving shared problems individually is tied to resources that are often unequally distributed between people. Inequality (Zelmer, 2003) and individualism (Gross & De Dreu, 2019) can complicate cooperation, however, their interplay is largely unknown. We confronted 50 groups (N = 200) with a public goods game with the additional option to solve a shared problem individually through a private solution. Across groups, group members had either an equal or an unequal resource distribution. The private solution allowed wealthier group members to leave the group and avoid contributing to the public good. This resulted in increased inequality. Specifically, the easier it was to opt for a private solution, the higher the inequality was. We further investigated voting preferences and fairness perceptions by having sixty-one impartial raters complete the task from a third-party perspective. The third-party players preferred a more equitable solution that would result in lower inequality. While group members dependent on the public solution voted for delegating allocation decisions to the third party, the wealthier, and thus, more independent members voted against it revealing self-serving motives. Our findings highlight unique problems emerging with self-reliance in the face of global issues, such as a pandemic and global warming, that require cooperation. Especially, when self-reliance is only affordable for some, collective action can fail and further increase wealth gaps.","['public goods dilemma', 'inequality', 'individualism', 'fairness']"

Psychological therapy for older adults with anxiety complaints: Therapists’ characteristics as predictors of therapeutic outcomes,"Kollia, Mary","['Wiltox, M.', 'Putman, P.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Anxiety is one of the most common mental health problems among older adults. Although there are interventions that effectively reduce late-life anxiety, anxious older adults often do not receive adequate treatment and are less likely to benefit from psychotherapy, compared to younger adults. To enhance mental health services for the elderly, studies should explore which factors predict treatment outcomes, rather than solely focus on the overall treatment effectiveness. The aim of the present study is to investigate demographic (age and gender) and professional (years of working experience and geriatric education) therapeutic characteristics, as predictors of treatment outcomes (anxiety severity and treatment satisfaction) in anxious older adults. Methods: The study is a post-hoc analysis using data from a previous Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) on treatment effectiveness in older adults with anxiety complaints. We examined data from 275 patients (55-75 years old) and 33 therapists, who worked in general practices in the Netherlands. We developed two multilevel regression models and intercept-only models, for both therapeutic outcomes. Results: The analyses showed that none of the therapeutic characteristics significantly predicted anxiety severity and treatment satisfaction at posttreatment; the therapist factor explained 0% and 15% of the variance in older adults’ anxiety and satisfaction levels, respectively. Discussion: Possible lack of power in the study hinders the interpretation of the null-findings regarding the demographic and professional therapist characteristics. The therapist factor does not predict late-life anxiety, but does have an effect on patients’ satisfaction. Limitations of the study and recommendations for future research are discussed.",

“Am I Enough?” How Perfectionism Relates to Self-Esteem and the Potentially Moderating Effect of Giftedness in Early Adolescence,"Cruden, Jade","['Zanolie, K.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Self-esteem is an accumulation of cognitive and emotional self-reflections. Perfectionism and self-esteem in adolescence are associated to later life (mal)adaptive development. Whereas self-oriented perfectionists (SOP) aspire to an ideal standard for themselves, socially prescribed perfectionists (SPP) experience pressure from others. While striving traits of SOP (SOP-S) are associated with healthy adjustment, critical SOP (SOP-C) and SPP tendencies have been associated with maladjustment. It remains unclear whether intellectual giftedness, a high cognitive ability level, serves as a risk factor or a protective factor for self-esteem. Nevertheless, subgroups of gifted individuals seem vulnerable to maladaptive perfectionism. Therefore, this study investigated associations between perfectionism and self-esteem through multiple linear regression. SOP-S was assumed to have a positive relationship to self-esteem, whereas SOP-C and SPP, respectively, were predicted to have a negative relationship to self-esteem. Moreover, giftedness was hypothesized to be a moderator for all three relationships. Gifted and nongifted children, ages 10 through 12, completed the Child and Adolescent Perfectionism Scale (CAPS) and the Rosenberg Self- Esteem Scale (RSES). SOP-C was indeed negatively associated with self-esteem. Neither SOP-S or SPP appeared significantly related to self-esteem. No moderation effect of giftedness was found, suggesting a similar effect of SOP-C on self-esteem for gifted and nongifted students. The lack of associations for either SOP-S or SPP with self-esteem was not in line with past literature. The CAPS may have failed to capture the essence the SOP-S dimension and the developmental stage of participants might have influenced their experience of SPP. Future studies should include larger sample sizes and preferably additional measures of perfectionism. Multiple reporters would be beneficial.",

Does self-esteem mediate the relationship between decrease in smartphone use and decrease in depressive symptoms and burnout symptoms in students?,"Kol, Aletta","['Vandenbroucke, A.', 'Zanolie, K.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Increased smartphone use has been linked to a number of mental health problems, but little is known about whether limiting smartphone use could reduce mental health problems. In this intervention study among students, the relationship between change in smartphone use and change in depressive symptoms and burnout symptoms was investigated. We also investigated whether this relationship was mediated or moderated by self-esteem. Among 50 Dutch students (94% female, mean age = 19.4 years, SD = 1.4) a questionnaire was administered about smartphone use, depressive symptoms (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale), burnout symptoms (Utrechtse Burnout Scale), and self-esteem (Rosenberg Selfesteem Scale), after which they were either assigned to the intervention group or control group. The intervention group was given five tips to limit their smartphone use and the control group was told they would start the intervention in two weeks and could continue using their phone as usual. Two weeks later, all participants completed the same questionnaires again and were debriefed about the experiment. Our intervention did not lead to a decrease in smartphone use in the intervention group compared to the control group. The intervention did also not lead to a decrease in depressive symptoms or burnout symptoms and there was no significant relationship between change in smartphone use and change in depressive or burnout symptoms, hence we were not able to perform a mediation analysis. Self-esteem was also not a moderator in these relationships. In conclusion, our intervention on smartphone use does not lead to a decrease in smartphone use, neither does this lead to a decrease in mental health problems such as depression and burnout. However, this might be due to the lack of power and that we had less participants than anticipated, because of COVID-19.",

A sample of 160 healthy adolescents (74 males and 86 females) participated in the study. Most of the participants were Dutch-born and their ages ranged from 11 to 21 years old. Variables of interest were measured through self-reported questionnaires filled at home. The analyses showed evidence of a positive correlation between indecisiveness and both fear of negative evaluation and self-concept clarity. However, no differences were found in the indecisiveness levels between early and late adolescents. Likewise, an additional explorative analysis showed no interaction effects between FNE and SCC on indecisiveness. Although indecisiveness in adolescence is a complex -and hard to predict- phenomenon, this study added valuable information on this topic. Limitations and implications of the study are discussed, together with suggestions for future research.","['indecisiveness', 'fear of negative evaluation', 'self-concept clarity', 'adolescence']"

The impact of depressive mood and obesity on postprandial glucose levels after a standardized meal,"Kamerman, Jef","['Molendijk, M.', 'Elzinga, B.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Depression, obesity and T2D are growing healthcare and societal burdens worldwide. Several studies showed that there are relationships between these burdens. T2D often coincides with depression and vice versa, whereas elevated glucose levels can indicate T2D. Current study focuses on depressive mood, postprandial- and glucose levels. This cross-sectional cohort study utilized secondary, quantitative data from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) study (N = 6671), which included a meal challenge. The Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS), was used to assess depressive mood. It was expected that depressive mood predicts elevated postprandial- and fasting glucose levels. Sex, BMI and Total Body Fat were expected to be moderators. Depressive mood significantly predicted elevated postprandial- and fasting glucose levels, before adding covariates other than age and sex. Sex, BMI and TBF all significantly moderated the associations between depressive mood and elevated postprandial- and fasting glucose. The effect of depressive mood on postprandial glucose, but not fasting glucose, was stronger in females than in males, with B = .017, p < .001 and B = 007, p < .001, respectively. Subjects with depressive mood are more at risk for developing IGM, IFG, and ultimately T2D. Women are more at risk than men, whereas excess weight also seems a risk factor for elevated glucose levels. It is suggested that future research focusses on the impact of confounding variables and depressive symptoms by itself, to more accurately study the effect of depression on IGM, IFG and T2D.","['depressive', 'mood', 'elevated', 'postprandial', 'fasting', 'glucose', 'obesity']"
Social competence and sensory processing in ASD children: a study on associations and gender differences,"Thiele, Juliët","['Schaefer, R.', 'Schuitema, I.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. Sensory processing problems and impaired social skills are often seen in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Moreover, understanding the gender gap in ASD prevalence and symptomatology is still not achieved. Studies are inconsistent in findings regarding gender specific ASD symptomatology and possible underlying mechanisms of gender differences. This study investigated the relationship between sensory processing and impaired social skills, and whether a mean difference exists in sensory processing symptoms between ASD boys and girls with similar social skills. Method. In this cross-sectional study 169 children (aged 7-12) participated, of which 96 typically developing (TD) and 58 ASD children. All were tested on social skills, measured through the Social Responsiveness Scale and on sensory processing problems, which was mapped out by measures of tapping accuracy, using the DrumPad 2.0 as a rhythmic measurement device. The relationship between sensory processing and social skills was investigated with the use of a Spearman’s Rho test. Mean differences in sensory processing between ASD boys and girls with similar social skills were investigated with the use of a 2x2 ANCOVA. Results. After performing Spearman's Rho test, a significant positive relationship was found in the overall sample between social skills and tapping accuracy. The 2x2 ANCOVA did not prove a significant effect of gender on mean tapping accuracy, but a significant main effect of social skills on the mean tapping accuracy was found. No significant interaction effect of gender and social skills was found. Discussion. Results indicated that social skills and tapping accuracy are associated, and that – after correction for age – social skills have an effect on tapping accuracy, irrespective of gender. To our knowledge, this is the first time that sensory processing was measured through a rhythmic device. This study contributes to the existing literature regarding gender-specific symptomology in ASD.","['ASD', 'social skills', 'sensory processing', 'tapping accuracy', 'gender differences']"
Exploring how inter-individual differences in attachment relate to feelings of connectedness when adolescents make eye contact with their parents,"Kritsotaki, Anna Maria","['Will, G.J.', 'Garnefski, N.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"There is a wealth of literature describing the role of eye contact in parent-child bonding between mothers and their infant children and in interpersonal bonding between adults. However, it is unclear how making eye contact with parents during adolescence – a period during which individuals seek independence from their parents– relates to feelings of connectedness to parents. This study examined adolescents’ (n=61; 67.2% female) subjective feelings of connectedness, liking of interaction-partner and mood after receiving a direct and an averted gaze from their parent and other unfamiliar people. It also explored whether individual differences in attachment to parents moderate increases in these feelings after making eye contact. Participants, aged between 12 and 18 years-old (M=16.03; SD=1.22), were asked to make eye contact with one of their parents, an unfamiliar adult and an unfamiliar peer, using pre-recorded videos. In half of the videos, interaction partners averted their gaze while in the other half they looked directly into the camera. After each video, adolescents were asked to report on their feeling of connectedness, liking of each person and mood. My results demonstrate that adolescents reported increased feelings of connectedness, liking of their interaction-partner and mood after making eye contact with all interaction-partners. Individual differences in attachment (measured using the Inventory of Parent Attachment; IPPA) did not modulate subjective feelings after making eye contact. These findings provide evidence for a causal role of making eye contact on mood and feelings of connectedness. Potentially, eye contact can be used to improve dysfunctional parent-adolescent relationships, by facilitating closeness in clinical settings.","['connectedness', 'liking of interaction-partner', 'mood', 'attachment', 'eye-contact', 'adolescents']"

The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn’t said: An overview of communication and psychological safety in a healthcare setting.,"Hilgevoord, Sjors","['Groeneweg, J.', 'Kleijn, R. de']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In the dynamic world of healthcare, where people work together in multidisciplinary teams, psychological safety is necessary for effective teamwork. Psychological safety leads to more team learning, self-expression and personal engagement that in turn increases team effectivity. With those beneficial effects in mind, an important part (the first subquestion) of this study focused on the level of psychological safety of various actors at the department of Neurology/Neurosurgery/Neurocare in a large university hospital. Furthermore, this first subquestion served a larger goal. The hospital is about to implement changes in rules and regulations concerning the work activities of healthcare workers, in order to increase patient safety. According to the results of this study, the level of psychological safety was on an adequate level. The second subquestion addressed the prevalent communication styles among colleagues on the work floor of the abovementioned departments. The results suggested that healthcare workers use significantly more directive (dominant and contentious) communication styles compared to non-directive (attentive and friendly) communication styles. No difference was found between the communication styles of nurses and doctors. Since the way of communication may influence psychological safety, the third subquestion focused on the relationship of communication styles and psychological safety. No association was found between those two concepts. However, we found some indications in our very small sample size that nurses with non-directive communication styles may be vulnerable to experiencing a lower level of psychological safety. Because of Covid-19 regulations, the sample size was limited, so the findings are not generalisable. However, this study does serve as a proof-of-concept of a study that can be conducted in the future. In a subsequent similar study, the same method with some modifications can be used to get more generalisable findings and insights into the relationship between communication styles and psychological safety.","['Psychological safety', 'communication', 'healthcare', 'patient safety', 'teams']"

Establishing a common metric to facilitate the understanding of test scores in Routine Outcome Monitoring applied to measurement instruments for anxiety,"Hesse, Anna Lena","['Beurs, E. de', 'Aktar, E.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Questionnaires for anxiety disorders come in different lengths, scales and with varying interpretation guidelines. This may hamper therapist-patient communication when discussing the score and the interpretation of where a patient can be placed on a severity scale. Expressing scores on a standardized common metric can facilitate the communication between therapist and patient. This thesis aims for a method that enables an easier interpretation of scores and in addition produces scores with a normal distribution. Method: Using the data of four anxiety questionnaires, namely the Brief Scale for Anxiety (BSA), the PADUA Inventory Revised (PI-R), the Panic Appraisal Inventory (POL/PAI) and the Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R), theta-based T-scores were calculated with the Item-Response Theory and deployed as a basis for crosswalk tables to look up T-scores from raw scores. Based on these crosswalk tables, transformation formulas were established to calculate T-scores. To validate these, calculated T-scores were compared to theta-based T-scores. Results: Most of the calculated T-scores had a normal distribution and the correlations between both methods to arrive at the T-scores were significant, the highest correlation was found for the BSA and the IES-R. Discussion: Due to a significant correlation and a large sample size a new method to arrive at a common metric was established by linking every raw score on a T-score metric. This provides a way to facilitate the interpretation and discussion of outcome scores. Further, with this new method disorder severity can be calculated and looked up due to tangible cut-off scores.",

Managing illness to improve patients’ quality of life: How does self-management influence the relationship between acceptance and both health related quality of life and fatigue?,"Wiegman, Noémi","['Tommel, J.', 'Brosschot, J.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a growing healthcare problem. It has high morbidity and mortality rates, impairs health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and results in severe fatigue. Illness perceptions such as acceptance and self-management have been studied regarding their impact on HRQOL and fatigue. The objective was to study the effect of self-management on the relationship between illness cognitions and health-related quality of life and fatigue. Hypothesized was that a higher level of self-management would mediate the relations between acceptance and physical HRQOL, mental HRQOL and fatigue. Three hypotheses were studied among a sample containing 39 Dutch dialysis patients. These participants answered several online questionnaires, such as the RAND Short Form36, Partner in Health scale, Illness Cognitions Questionnaire and Checklist Individual Strength. The results show that selfmanagement was not a significant mediator for the relations between acceptance and physical HRQOL, mental HRQOL and fatigue. The results also show that acceptance was associated with self-management and mental HRQOL. Furthermore, acceptance and self-management were found to be corelated with physical and mental HRQOL. The sample size was small, and the scores on the acceptance and self-management measurements were relatively high, which caused ceiling effects. This made it difficult to interpret the results. However, involving acceptance and self-management in interventions for ESRD patients in order to alleviate HRQOL could be beneficial for the patients. Therapies such as cognitive behavior therapy and acceptance commitment therapy use such aspects and can be used in care for ESRD patients.",

Disease-specific quality of life and potential contributing factors in different subgroups of objective and subjective severity of Alopecia Areata,"Stam, Anne","['Middendorp, H. van', 'Doef, M. van der']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Alopecia Areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease affecting the hair follicles resulting in irregular hair loss. The severity and unpredictability of the condition could lead to feelings of helplessness and lack of control, resulting in a decreasing quality of life. Until now no disease-specific psychological interventions exist for patients with AA. Therefore this study looked into potential contributing factors that could be implemented to improve the disease-specific quality of life of patients with AA. A questionnaire on demographic and disease-related factors was sent to Dutch Alopecia Association members. A total of 271 participants were placed in one of four subgroups based on their combination of high vs low objective and subjective AA severity; all subgroups contained ≥ 37 participants. Results showed that diseasespecific quality of life was highest in patients with a mild subjective AA condition, regardless the objective severity of the condition. Potential contributing factors related to a lower disease-specific quality of life for patients with AA were more stigmatization, fear of negative evaluation, and helplessness, and less acceptance; no major differences in contributing factors between the subgroups were found. This study signifies the importance of subjective over objective disease severity related to disease-specific quality of life in patients with AA. More research is needed on the causal relationship between disease-specific quality of life and these factors. Nevertheless, the results of this study suggest that subjective severity of AA, stigmatization, helplessness, fear of negative evaluation, and acceptance could be considered as potential contributing factors to disease-specific quality of life.",
"Transcultural Awareness: An Investigation of the Knowledge of Brua among Psychologists, Psychiatrists and Psychiatrists in Training in the Netherlands","Beitsma, Fabian","['Blom, J.D.', 'Beurs, E. de']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Brua is an Afro-Caribbean set of spiritual beliefs found on the ABC Islands (Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao), which are part of the Dutch Antilles. Psychiatric patients from these islands may believe that their mental health is influenced by Brua-related practices. It is therefore important that mental health professionals are knowledgeable of Brua, but it is not yet known to what extent they are. Goal: This study investigated the knowledge of Brua among psychologists, psychiatrists, and psychiatrists in training in The Netherlands. Methods: All psychologists, psychiatrists, and psychiatrists in training in the service of Parnassia Psychiatric Institute were contacted to fill out a tailor-made survey on knowledge of Brua. Sufficient knowledge of Brua was defined as a score of 6 or higher out of 10. Three potential predictors of knowledge of Brua were investigated, namely work experience, ethnicity, and inquiry into religious beliefs in the clinical practice. Results: Out of the 152 participants, 13.2% scored a sufficient score on knowledge of Brua. Work experience did not predict total score on the survey. There were too few participants of non-Caucasian ethnicities to investigate the relationship between ethnicity and knowledge of Brua. Practitioners who often inquired into religious beliefs in the clinical practice did not score higher than practitioners who sometimes inquired into religious beliefs. Conclusion: Knowledge of Brua among psychologists, psychiatrists, and psychiatrists in training in The Netherlands is limited. Informational or educational campaigns on how to assess the role of Brua in clinical practice are recommended.",

Variables of interest were measured through self-reported questionnaires filled at home. The analyses showed evidence of a positive correlation between indecisiveness and both fear of negative evaluation and self-concept clarity. However, no differences were found in the indecisiveness levels between early and late adolescents. Likewise, an additional explorative analysis showed no interaction effects between FNE and SCC on indecisiveness. Although indecisiveness in adolescence is a complex -and hard to predict- phenomenon, this study added valuable information on this topic. Limitations and implications of the study are discussed, together with suggestions for future research.","['indecisiveness', 'fear of negative evaluation', 'self-concept clarity', 'adolescence']"

The prevalence of anxiety symptomatology in depressed persons across age groups,"Lach, Démi","['Rhebergen, D.', 'Janssen, L.', 'Antypa, N.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Functioning and treatment outcome of persons with a major depressive disorder (MDD) is not only impacted by comorbid anxiety disorders, but also by comorbid anxiety symptoms not fulfilling the DSM-criteria for an anxiety disorders. Previous findings suggest that MDD in older age may differ in symptom profile with respect to anxiety symptomatology, with higher rates of anxiety in older age. However, findings remain inconsistent. Considering its clinical relevance further insight into symptom profiles of depression with anxiety symptomatology across the lifespan is needed. This study examined if and to what extent anxiety symptomatology in persons with MDD differs across age groups in the general population, as research in the general population is largely lacking and previous research mostly refers to clinical samples. Method: Data were derived from a large, general population cohort study, the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2). Selected were 365 subjects (aged 21-72 years) with a MDD episode, of any duration, during three years prior to baseline (e.g. a 3-year MDD). To analyse impact of age on symptom profile, logistic regression analyses were conducted examining the association between age and presence of symptoms, including MDD and anxiety symptoms, using items derived from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 (CIDI 3.0). Results: Overall, logistic regression analyses did not yield significant results with regard to a different association of symptomatology in older persons with MDD, as compared to younger age. Only older age was more strongly associated with feeling anxious (OR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.22– 3.97) in comparison to younger age. Conclusion: In general, anxiety symptomatology in depressed persons does not differ across the lifespan. However, we demonstrated that feeling anxious has been found to increase over the lifespan. Since this more anxious presentation in older depressed persons may blur the underlying MDD, attention from clinicians is required to be aware that depression in later-life can present itself with more anxious feelings.",

It is known that people living in poverty feel shame, but what the impact is on trust, for instance when seeking help, is not well studied. We tried to manipulate 120 female participants into feeling either public shame, private shame, and nothing in particular (baseline condition). This was done by letting the participant in the first two conditions do a very difficult math- and language test, next to a confederate who clearly outperformed them. After the manipulation, a Trust Game was done. We expected that feeling shame caused them to score lower on the trust game and thus have less trust in others. Significant differences were found between shame scores of the public shame and the baseline conditions and between the private shame group and the baseline condition. However, no significant differences were found between the trust scores of the three conditions. This is notable because other studies show that beliefs about how one is perceived by others affects trust. This study provides important information on what feelings of shame can be evoked by counselors, and on the impact on clients’ ability to trust others. Future studies could further explore the mechanism behind this relationship, improving the limitations that were encountered in the present study.",

Psychological Safety and Innovative Work Behaviours in Health Care Workers: The Mediating Role of Tacit and Explicit Knowledge Sharing,"Şekerli, Ece","['Groeneweg, J.', 'Band, G.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In times of rapid change, like what the world is currently going through, certain organizational circumstances might facilitate adapting to novel situations, especially in complex organizations like health care. Health care workers having an innovative mindset might be one of these circumstances. Further, this mindset and health care workers’ innovative work behaviours (IWB) might be facilitated by the existence of psychological safety within their work teams. However, to understand the relationship between psychological safety and IWB and to be able to induce it, it is crucial to understand what dynamics underlie this relationship. In this study, the relationship between psychological safety and IWB, and whether this relationship was mediated by tacit and/or explicit knowledge sharing, were investigated. The sample consisted of 182 health care workers (120 females, 62 males, Mage = 36.25) and they were recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. Participants filled out an online questionnaire consisting of 36 questions about psychological safety, tacit and explicit knowledge sharing, and IWB within their work teams. Results indicated that while explicit knowledge sharing had an indirect effect on the relationship between psychological safety and innovative work behaviours, indicating mediation, tacit knowledge sharing did not have a significant indirect effect. The cognitive effort involved in sharing knowledge is discussed as a potential reason why a mediating effect was not observed for tacit knowledge sharing. Recommendations for further research and the limitations of the current study are discussed.","['innovative work behaviours', 'knowledge sharing', 'tacit', 'explicit', 'psychological safety']"

However, people in debt are often reluctant to contact the creditor and identify shame as a barrier. Moreover, they experience a lack of acknowledgement when communicating with creditors. Given the human need for acknowledgement and the suggestion that acknowledgement can reduce shame, the current study examined the effect of acknowledgement on indebted people’s willingness to contact the creditor and explored the role of financial shame. To this end, 206 native English-speaking people with current or past debts completed an online experiment in which they read either a standard creditor letter or a creditor letter in which the creditor acknowledged the situation of the person in debt. Willingness to contact the creditor and financial shame did not differ between participants who read a creditor letter in which their situations were acknowledged and those whose read a standard creditor letter. However, higher financial shame was associated with lower willingness to contact. We conclude that acknowledging indebted people’s situations is not enough to increase their willingness to contact the creditor. Future research could test other ways to address and reduce the financial shame.","['acknowledgement', 'understanding', 'willingness to contact', 'financial shame', 'debt', 'creditor', 'creditor letter', 'avoidance']"
Anxiety but not Depression Predicts Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson’s Disease,"Waskowiak, Pauline","['Ruitenberg, M.', 'Pannekoek, N.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: In addition to the well-known motor symptoms, Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients also frequently experience disabling non-motor symptoms, such as impulse control disorders (ICDs). The present study aimed to assess the predictive value of depression and anxiety, and the interaction of these factors with dopaminergic replacement therapy (DRT), for ICD development in de novo PD patients. Methods: Using the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative database, a total of 334 de novo PD patients with a negative ICD screen at baseline (assessed with the Questionnaire for Impulsive‐ Compulsive Disorders short form QUIP-S) were included in the present study. Baseline depression and anxiety were measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y), respectively. The outcome measures were ICD presence (a positive QUIP-S score) at follow-up visits, and ICD onset duration (time in months from baseline until ICD development). Binominal logistic regression and multiple regression analyses were performed to assess predictors for ICD presence and duration until ICD onset, respectively. Results: In total, 149 participants (44.6%) developed an ICD and the time of ICD onset was on average 34.54 months (SD=24.74) after baseline. Baseline STAI-Y scores were a significant predictor of ICD presence at follow-up visits, and higher scores were associated with an increased likelihood of developing an ICD (OR=1.02, 95% CI 1.00,1.05, p=.036). The first DRT type also significantly predicted ICD incidence, and dopamine agonists were associated with 2.34 higher odds (95% CI 1.45,3.86, p=.001) of developing an ICD, compared to levodopa or other medication types. Both effects were not confounded by age, gender or UPDRS motor score. GDS-15 scores and the interaction terms GDS-15 x DRT type and STAI-Y x DRT type did not significantly predict ICD presence (all ps>.299). None of the investigated factors significantly predicted ICD onset duration (all ps>.091). Implications: The finding that increased anxiety levels in de novo PD patients represent an ICD risk factor highlights the need for early and routine based anxiety screening in these patients. Additionally, clinicians should carefully consider the first choice of DRT, given that patients who received dopamine agonists as their first medication type encountered an increased ICD risk.",
Pregnancy does not Lead to Greater Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task: Performance in Primiparous Women,"Berns, Puck","['Hoekzema, E.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Pregnancy leads to volumetric reductions in brain regions involved in Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks. These volumetric reductions appear to be an expression of the woman’s brain preparing itself for motherhood and caregiving. Yet, how pregnancy affects ToM abilities is still largely unknown. The present study investigated how pregnancy affects ToM in primiparous women (i.e., woman who is bearing a first offspring) and whether these changes are predictive of maternal sensitivity. ToM abilities, as assessed through total accuracy scores on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task (RMET), were not enhanced at post-pregnancy, compared to pre-pregnancy (H1). Neither did we observe a stronger enhancement in RMET child format performance compared to RMET-adult performance over the course of pregnancy (H2). Moreover, changes in ToM abilities across pregnancy was not a significant predictor of maternal sensitivity at one year postpartum (H3). In conclusion, ToM abilities, as assessed via RMET, did not change over de course of pregnancy. We speculated that the incongruence between our hypotheses and results could potentially be attributed to suboptimal operationalization of ToM abilities. For future studies it may be relevant to include ToM measures that focus more directly on the affective aspect of ToM.","['pregnancy', 'primiparous women', 'Theory of Mind', 'Reading the Eyes in the Mind', 'emotion recognition', 'Mini-Maternal Behavior Q-sort', 'maternal sensitivity']"
Differentiation of Cognitive Performance Statuses in Multiple Sclerosis using Principal Component Analyses,"Haveman, Yudith","['Schuitema, I.', 'Houdt, C.A. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurodegenerative disease among young adults, of which 40-70% of the patients suffer from cognitive impairment. Currently, there is no biomarker predicting the cognitive status of MS patients. This study performed a principal component analysis in order to find a disease pattern that can aid in the differentiation of cognitive impairment in MS. Methods: A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to create a disease pattern based on differences in whole-brain voxel intensities of conventional MRI sequences (T1, T2, and T2- FLAIR) and magnetization transfer (MT)-based MRI of 15 cognitively preserved MS patients (MSCP), 15 impaired patients (MS-CI) and 15 controls. A leave-one-out approach was used to validate the disease patterns between different cognitive performance statuses. Results: None of the conventional MRI sequences nor MT-based MRI were able to find a significant disease pattern for separating MS patients on cognitive status. The frontal cortex, periventricular zone, longitudinal fasciculus, thalamus and brainstem were more severely affected in cognitive impaired MS patients, although significance was not reached. Conclusion: Although the brain patterns created with both conventional MRI sequences and MTbased MRI sequences for evaluating cognitive performance in MS were not significant, the PCA is still a promising technique, when a larger sample size can be included.","['Multiple sclerosis', 'cognition', 'MRI', 'magnetization transfer', 'principal component analysis']"
The Role of Avoidance and Anhedonia in the Development of Depression in Socially Anxious Adolescents,"Meuleman, Judith","['Blöte, A.', 'Miers, A.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction. It has been argued that avoidance behaviour and anhedonia are possible predictors of developing depression in youth with high levels of social anxiety. Method. A community sample of 237 participants (age 9 - 17 years) participated in the present longitudinal study. During three waves, (over a period of three years) levels of social anxiety, avoidance behaviour, anhedonia and depression were collected using self-report questionnaires. Results. Mediation analyses show that high levels of social anxiety in youth predict an increase of depressive symptoms over time. This was fully mediated by avoidance. However, when controlling for initial depression levels the relation between social anxiety and later depression was no longer significant, though avoidance remained a full mediator. Anhedonia was not a significant mediator in the link between social anxiety and depression. Discussion. It has been argued that socially anxious youth tend to avoid social situations which leads to a relative increase of depression over time. However, socially anxious youth do not experience more anhedonia, while youth with high levels of anhedonia are at risk of developing depression. A recommendation for future research concerns another, better, sequential model to conduct this area. Finally, limitations of the study and therefor suggestions for future research involve a larger and more varied sample as well as including more methods to avoid subjectivity.",
Think Before You Drink! The Effects of Caffeine on Cognitive Task Performance Under Acute Performance Stress,"Aksungur, Sebla Umay","['Putman, P.', 'Krause-Utz, A.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Various forms of anxiety, including state and trait cognitive test anxiety, are associated with disruptions in an individual’s cognitive task performance via its detrimental effects on attentional control capacity of individuals. These disruptions become more evident when the individual is under stress. Frontal EEG theta/beta ratio (TBR) has been suggested to reflect individuals’ baseline attentional control capacity. Furthermore, caffeine has been associated with facilitating or impairing attentional control processes, depending on individuals’ baseline prefrontal cortex functioning. The main goal of this study was to investigate the effects of caffeine on an individual’s working memory (WM) task performance under stress, based on their baseline TBR and anxiety vulnerability. An n-back task was used to assess WM task performance after experimentally induced acute performance stress in a betweensubjects design where the caffeine (200mg) and placebo manipulation was double-blinded, and the sample composed of 120 simulated data. Results of this study are based on synthetic data because of the inability to collect data during covid-19 lockdown. Results showed a moderation of TBR on caffeine: for people with high TBR at baseline (i.e. low attentional control capacity) caffeine boosted WM performance efficiency; while for people with low TBR at baseline (i.e. high attentional control capacity) caffeine disrupted WM performance efficiency. Results provide further support for TBR to be an indicator of attentional control capacity as well as underlining the importance of taking baseline prefrontal functioning of individuals into account when investigating the effects of caffeine on cognitive task performance as previously reported.",

Effects of Self-Efficacy Manipulation on Pain Tolerance in Healthy Participants,"Zoumpa, Maria","['Veldhuijzen, J.', 'Dijk, S. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Prior research has demonstrated a strong positive relationship between self-efficacy beliefs and pain tolerance. However, the pathways through which self-efficacy beliefs may be manipulated and affect pain tolerance are not clear. The current study aims to examine the effect that self-efficacy beliefs have on pain tolerance ratings, as assessed by a cold-pressor test (CPT). Secondly, whether self-efficacy can be altered through verbal suggestions is examined. Healthy participants (N = 17) were randomly assigned into a low self-efficacy group (Low-SE group) and a high self-efficacy (High-SE group) and participated in a CPT, after self-efficacy manipulation. Differences on pain tolerance and the manipulation check question, across the groups were examined with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Baseline measurements of self-efficacy were administered and analysed with ANOVA. Although participants in the High-SE group showed higher pain tolerance ratings (M = 43.23, SD = 19.09) compared to those in the Low-SE group (M = 41.58, SD = 23.36), the difference between the groups was not significant, p = .883. Participants in the High-SE group (M = 5.24, SD = 1.89) had a lower score on the manipulation check question, compared to those in the Low-SE group (M = 5.62, SD = 1.71). However, the difference was not statistically significant, p = .666. No statistically significant baseline differences have been found between the groups. Further research is needed, to determine the mechanisms through which perceived control and affective responses on pain experience may intermediate the relationship between self-efficacy and pain tolerance, while contributing to self-efficacy manipulation.",
Is an Intensive Residential Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Treatment Programme Effective for Patients with a History of Childhood Sexual Abuse?,"Duin, Laura van","['Berg, J. van den', 'Giezen, A. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study investigates the results of a high intensive residential trauma-focussed therapy programme. The main hypotheses were that (1) PTSD patients with a history of CSA report a clinically significant decrease in their PTSD symptoms after treatment, and (2) PTSD patients with a history of CSA would profit equally from trauma-focused treatment as PTSD patients without a history of CSA. Methods: Patients were 76 individuals who participated in a five-day treatment program consisting of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), prolonged exposure (PE) sessions, and trauma-sensitive yoga. The severity of PTSD symptoms was assessed with the PCL-5 at pre- and post-treatment, at one-week follow-up, and at a one-month follow-up. Pre-post differences were calculated and compared between the two trauma conditions (i.e., patients with a history of CSA, and no CSA). Results: Treatment resulted in a significant short term decrease of PTSD symptoms, which was mostly maintained at follow-up. Although patients with a history of CSA showed significantly higher PTSD symptom severity at pre- and post-treatment compared to those without a history of CSA, no significant pre-post differences were found between the two groups. Longer term decrease in PTSD symptoms was significant for patients without a history of CSA, but was not strong enough to be significant for patients with a history of CSA. Clinical significance of the treatment was demonstrated for half of the participants. Conclusion: Results suggest that intensive treatment for PTSD might be a possible therapeutic option for PTSD patients with a history of CSA.","['PTSD', 'childhood sexual abuse', 'treatment', 'EMDR']"

Bright Light Therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis and its effect on Depression,"López Vaca, Nathalia","['Habers, G.E.A.', 'Houdt, C.A. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Depression symptoms are common in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients. This could be caused by the limited activities of daily life experienced by RA patients as well as by the inflammation pathways altered by RA which are known to influence depression. Bright light therapy (BLT) has previously shown to be effective to tackle depression caused by an altered circadian rhythm. As a disrupted circadian rhythm is also common in RA patients, BLT might be effective as therapy to treat depression in RA. Objective: The goal of the present study is to examine the effects of BLT on depression and mental health, as well as to explorative examine whether this effect is mediated by changes in circadian rhythmicity in RA patients. Method: This study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo controlled single center pilot trial study. It consists of 48 RA patients, divided into intervention group with active BLT, and control group with sham BLT. Measurements were taken at three periods: baseline (T0), at the end of the 4-week with BLT (T1), and at follow-up four weeks after BLT (T2). Measurement tools used consisted of a depression scale (HADS) and a mental health scale (RAND 36), as well as the time point of melatonin onset measured by the Dim Light Melatonin Onset test (DLMO). BLT was administered with Luminette glasses which emitted a different color for the intervention group (blue light, to induce circadian phase shift) compared to control group. Results: The results suggest that there is no significant difference with regards to depression, mental health and DLMO between the two groups in the changes between the measurement points from T0 to T1 and from T0 to T2. No significant results were found with regards to the mediating role of DLMO in the relationship between group and depression and mental health. Conclusion: No significant effects of group were found in the present study, with regards to changes in depression, mental health and DLMO, and no mediation effect of the DLMO in the relation between group, depression, and mental health was found. A possible explanation is the low levels of depression reported by the participants at baseline. Further studies are required before disregarding BLT as a potential therapeutic tool to treat depression in RA patients.","['Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Bright Light Therapy', 'Dim Light Melatonin Onset']"

Existing research has shown the high relevance of emotions in consumer–brand relationships. We propose that the emotion awe makes people feel connected to brands, because awe causes people to feel interconnected. The aim of this research was to investigate the relationship between music, awe and brand attachment. Participants in this online study (N = 199) were randomly divided into four conditions: a music condition, a recall condition, a music and recall condition, and a control condition. We hypothesized that listening to music would induce awe, which in turn would affect brand attachment. Results showed that music did not have a significant effect on awe, but recalling an experience of awe did. Furthermore, awe had a significant effect on brand attachment. Finally, the personality trait Openness to Experience predicted the experience of awe. The implications for these findings, directions for future research and limitations of the current research are discussed.","['brand attachment', 'awe', 'music', 'openness to experience']"
Uptake in Guided and Unguided eHealth Interventions: What is the Role of Self-Efficacy and Social Support?,"Schoot, Yalou","['Rodrigues, T.C.', 'Dijk, S. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"eHealth could be an effective tool to reduce stress in students. Since eHealth interventions are easy to use and relatively cheap, especially unguided eHealth interventions, it is important to know whether students want to take part in an unguided intervention as much as in a guided intervention, and which personal factors play a role in uptake. With this knowledge it might be possible to engage people that would normally not take part in an intervention. In research regarding adherence, perceived social support (PSS) and self-efficacy (SE) appear to play a role. This study focussed on guided and unguided eHealth interventions and the effect of uptake SE and PSS on uptake. We distributed a questionnaire with screenshots of an app amongst students (N = 143). They were randomly assigned to the guided or unguided condition. No effect was found of group on uptake, also PSS had no effect or interaction effect on uptake. Only a direct effect was found of uptake SE on uptake. A possible explanation for the same willingness to start in both groups is the Computers are Social Actors paradigma. Furthermore, uptake SE seems to influence uptake because in case of low levels of SE more support is needed. The results implicate that the type of intervention does not influence uptake, and that low levels of SE are related to lower levels of uptake. Further research should focus on how to increase uptake SE and the personal factors that play a role in uptake.","['eHealth', 'guided eHealth', 'unguided eHealth', 'uptake self-efficacy', 'self-efficacy', 'perceived social support']"

The findings reveal that consumers’ level of environmental involvement moderate the effects of functional and emotional appeals. Consumers with higher levels of environmental involvement showed clicked more often compared to low environmentally involved consumers on the functional appeal advertisement. Highly environmentally involved consumers also click more frequently on a functional appeal advertisement, compared to an emotional or combined appeal advertisement.

The Human Tendency to Approach Food and its Relation to BMI,"Dueren den Hollander, Eva van","['Zech, H.', 'Dillen, L. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"To help finding solutions to the growing prevalence of overweight and obesity, this field study examined the human tendency to approach food and its relation to BMI. Using a newly developed behavioral measurement method, food approach tendencies of 89 participants were assessed in states of hunger and satiation. Just as earlier lab studies, our results showed that people had approach tendencies to food. As expected, we also showed that participants with a high BMI had stronger food approach tendencies than participants with a low BMI. However, this study failed to confirm the expectation that the increased tendencies for people with a high BMI were more pronounced in states of satiation than in states of hunger. This failure could be attributed to (a) the fact that participants’ BMI did not vary enough, (b) the general disadvantages of our chosen statistical analysis, (c) contextual factors that we could not control for, or (d) the non-optimal exploitation of hunger state effects. Suggestions for future research are given.",

Self-Management Behaviour and the Well-Being of Dialysis Patients: Correlational Baseline Research Using Online Self-Report Questionnaires,"Kersseboom, Linda","['Tommel, J.', 'van der Doef, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Dialysis patients, who suffer from end-stage renal disease, experience severe symptoms and undergo an invasive treatment which negatively impacts their daily lives. Patients suffering from other chronic diseases have shown to improve their well-being through self-management behaviour. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether self-management acts as a mediator on the relations between self-efficacy, optimism and health outcomes (physical and mental quality of life, symptoms and symptom severity). This observational research was performed using online self-report questionnaires, taken by 39 Dutch dialysis patients that were recruited by their nephrologists. Self-management did not mediate the associations between self-efficacy, optimism and health outcomes. Higher levels of self-management were correlated with higher levels of self-efficacy. Higher levels of self-efficacy were strongly correlated with higher levels of self-management, mental quality of life and physical quality of life and with lower levels of bodily symptoms and symptom severity. Higher levels of optimism were correlated with lower levels of bodily symptoms and symptom severity. This means that even though self-management is correlated with self-efficacy and health outcomes, it does not influence their relation. Secondly, as optimism and self-management were not correlated, it could mean that optimism does not focus on behaviour but exemplifies a cognitive state. Considering the small sample size, it is advised to replicate this research and include more participants. This research contributes to the relatively new body of knowledge concerning the association of self-management and health outcomes in dialysis patients, which is vital for the development of chronic healthcare.","['self-management', 'end-stage renal disease', 'self-efficacy', 'optimism', 'quality of life', 'symptoms']"
Living in a depopulated village: sustainable livelihoods and the promise of future,"Díaz Cuyás, Juan Francisco","['Suidgeest, K.', 'Littlejohn, A.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Throughout the last 50 years the Spanish countryside has emptied due to the rural migration from villages to main industrial cities such as Madrid, Bilbao or Barcelona. Now, after decades of demographic decline, depopulation has become central in public and academic debate about rural development. This growing concern of emptying villages has raised questions about the precarious life and the sense of threat to people who live in these spaces and who are exposed to a loss of services and stable livelihood. This research is an ethnographic analysis of locals’ perspective living in the depopulated village of Yanguas, in Tierras Altas in the province of Soria, the most depopulated area in Spain. Departing from the concept of precarity within global capitalism I will focus on how people of Yanguas sustain a livelihood and how they perceive the village’s livability, while addressing the future perspective of development based on infrastructure creation. The findings in this research suggest that the struggles some people experienced while living in a depopulated village were not derived strictly from the fact that they live in a small community. On the contrary, the experience of depopulation, rather than being the source of precarity, was very often a symptom of other large-scale issues and social changes such as industrialization, delocalization, and patterns of social mobility and migration.

Cortical thickness in relation to cognitive performance within monozygotic twin pairs aged 60 to 100 years,"Landen, Sophie van der","['Habers, G.E.A.', 'Houdt, C.A. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In the search for a more affordable, less invasive biomarker to accurately diagnose and prognose Alzheimer’s disease (AD), measuring cortical thickness via magnetic resonance imaging is a promising method. Specific regions on the cortex are found to be related to AD, referred to as AD signature regions, but evidence for the persistence of the relationship between cortical thickness and cognitive decline in the preclinical phase of the disease is lacking. The aim of this study is to investigate whether a lower cortical thickness is related to worse cognitive performance and can predict cognitive decline over time. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that this trend is influenced by the presence of other AD biomarkers, e.g. amyloid status. In a cross-sectional and longitudinal study, we investigated 189 cognitively normal older adults (91 twin pairs and 7 single twins) and measured cortical thickness via magnetic resonance imaging, cognitive performance during neuropsychological assessment and amyloid pathology in positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid. Neuropsychological assessment was repeated after approximately two years. Cognitive performance was divided into four domains: memory, attention, executive functions and language. Participants were on average 70.23 (SD = 7.46) years and 107 (57%) were female. Cross-sectionally, we found that lower cortical thickness was related to worse memory performance (b = 0.133 [SE = 0.046], p = 0.004). When cortical thickness on separate AD signature regions was examined, we found that certain regions were related to performance on memory and executive functioning. Longitudinally, we found that cortical thickness at baseline could not predict cognitive performance over time. When examining the role of amyloid status in these relationships cross-sectionally, we found that both lower cortical thickness and positive amyloid status were related to worse memory performance (respectively, b = 0.237 [SE = 0.053], p = <.001 and b = -0.240 [SE = 0.108], p = 0.026), yet the interaction effect was not significant. These results provide evidence for the cross-sectional relationship between lower cortical thickness and worse cognitive performance, more specifically worse memory and executive functions performance. Future research must determine whether cortical thinning in contrast to cortical thickness, can predict cognitive performance over time. In that case, individuals at risk of AD can be easier identified in a more affordable and less invasive way.",

Following up on Mischel’s marshmallow experiment in 1970, this study investigated how to improve children’s self-control. An adaptation of the Standford marshmallow test was used in this research to measure delay of gratification (part of self-control). 228 families were selected to participate in this study. The Video-feedback Intervention to Promote Positive Parenting – Twins (VIPP-Twins) targeted 82 families with children from eight to twelve years old, to increase the children’s ability to delay gratification. This intervention targeting parents decreases the duration of intervention and would depend less on the intrinsic motivation of children than behavioral and attentional interventions targeting children often used in the past. It was hypothesized that children improve more in delaying gratification in the randomized VIPP-Twins intervention group than children in a randomized control group, in which parents did not receive an intervention. Also, because of ambiguous results in previous literature, it was investigated whether there was a gender difference in delay of gratification and the effectivity of the VIPP-Twins intervention. This study found no statistically significant effects. A methodological adaptation of the measurement of delay of gratification in this study could be adopted in future research. Multiple assessment methods of inhibition could be used to better highlight the gender differences in self-control present in previous literature.",

A chi-square test, followed by a post-hoc z-test was performed to examine if certain types of anxiety more often had a late-onset. Results showed no significant differences in clinical factors between the early- and late-onset group. Generalized anxiety was significantly more often reported with a late-onset than early-onset (χ2 = 14.516, p = <.001) This finding underscores the need for further research on late-onset types of anxiety. Older adults with early vs. late-onset anxiety might differ on other clinical factors than those studied in the current article.

It was expected that children would have more fear beliefs and attention towards the stranger paired with parental verbal threat comments compared to the stranger paired safe comments and that BI would have a moderating role on the effect of parental verbal comments. The sample consisted of 4-6-year-olds. In the experiment a manipulation was used where one stranger was paired with threat comments and the other one with safe comments, both given by the parent. Then, the children encountered the strangers during a social and interaction task. The results show that children’s fear beliefs about the stranger paired with parental threat comments were significantly higher than about the stranger paired with parental safe comments. This was not the case for children’s attention towards the strangers. So, parental verbal threat comments paired with a stranger led to more fear beliefs but did not increase attention. Furthermore, the moderating role of temperament was not significant. To conclude, this study supports the growing evidence that children's fear beliefs can be changed by giving information but did not found this effect for attention. Also, the effect of verbal threat information on fear beliefs and attention did not differ as a function of child temperament.",

"Inducing nocebo hyperalgesia using an open-label design: The relationship between pain catastrophizing and the nocebo effect, mediated by state anxiety","Meijer, Rosalyn","['Meijer, S.', 'Gucht, V. de']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Studies in the last couple of years revealed that nocebo effects, i.e., adverse treatment outcomes which are not caused by the active components of the treatment itself, negatively influence therapy results. Placebo effects could occur when participants know a treatment is inactive (i.e., open-label design). However, more research is needed to understand the effects of an open-label design with verbal suggestion on the nocebo effect. Secondly, more research is needed to detangle which personality factors are relevant to the nocebo effect. Objective: The present study aimed to investigate whether open-label conditioning combined with verbal suggestion can induce a nocebo effect. Furthermore, this research aimed to explore the relationship of pain catastrophizing and the nocebo response and investigate if this relationship was mediated by state anxiety. Design: A single blind, within-subjects, open-label design was used for the study. The nocebo effect was induced in 82 healthy females, via conditioning and verbal suggestion, using pressure pain. Before the experiment, participants filled in the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale to measure state anxiety and pain catastrophizing. Results: This study showed that open-label conditioning combined with verbal suggestions was effective in inducing increased pain after the conditioned stimulus when compared to the control stimulus, indicating the presence of the nocebo effect. No significant results were found to support the hypothesis that pain catastrophizing is correlated with the nocebo effect, nor that this effect is mediated by state anxiety. Conclusion: These findings highlight the possibility to investigate the nocebo effect using a more ethical open-label design. Future research can implement an open-label approach when designing treatment procedures in a clinical population. More research is needed to clarify the role of pain catastrophizing and state anxiety on the nocebo effect.",

Suicidal Musicians and Their Time Orientation in Lyrics and Social Media,"Quist, Julia","['Molendijk, M.', 'Bruijn, E. de']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"As previous studies show a positive relationship between present time orientation and psychological well-being, the purpose of the current within-subjects study is to examine whether a present time orientation, and otherwise mindfulness, can be found in word use of suicidal musicians over time. Fewer words referring to the present, compared to the past and the future were expected. Moreover, a decrease in the use of present time words, and an increase in the use of past and future time words, closer to the moment of suicide, was expected. The different means of the time categories were calculated with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used to test for differences in these means. To test for change over time in the time categories, the Kendall’s Tau B correlation coefficients were used. Present time orientation (M = 8.449) had a mean greater than both the mean of past time orientation (M = 2.308) and the future time orientation (M = 1.500). Moreover, future time orientation had a mean greater than past time orientation. I found that these differences were statistically significant. There was a significant decrease in words referring to the past (τb = -.113, p = .005) and a non-significant decrease in words referring to the future (τb = -.071, p = .081). Lastly, there was a significant decrease in words referring to the present (τb = -.153, p < .001). The finding of a decrease in present time, and the finding of less words referring to the future, compared to the past, are in line with previous studies on this topic. It is concluded that fewer words referring to the future, compared to the past and present, and a decrease in present time words over time can be an indication of suicide risk.",

Hebben studentes met een chaotische thuisomgeving een lagere mate van zelfcontrole? Samenhang tussen zelfcontrole en een chaotische thuisomgeving bij laat adolescenten,"Bierman, Maxime","['Linting, M', 'Voort, A. van der']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het bezitten van een hoge mate van zelfcontrole hangt samen met positieve uitkomsten zoals betere studieresultaten en minder alcoholmisbruik, blijkt uit meerdere, niet experimentele, studies. Zelfcontrole wordt hier gedefinieerd aan de hand van impulsinhibitie. Hierbij hangt een hoge mate van impulsiviteit en een lage mate van zelfcontrole samen met een lagere mate van Delay of Gratification (DoG). DoG wordt hier gemeten door middel van het Delay Discounting paradigm (DD). Het DD paradigm onderzoekt in hoeverre iemand bereid is om te wachten op een (hypothetische) geldsom als, door het wachten, deze beloning groter wordt. Uit eerder onderzoek onder jong-adolescenten blijkt een samenhang tussen zelfcontrole en chaos. Dit onderzoek kijkt of een dergelijke samenhang ook bestaat bij laatadolescenten. De verwachting is dat studentes met een meer chaotische thuisomgeving een mindere mate van zelfcontrole hebben. In dit onderzoek is gebruik gemaakt van drie instrumenten verzameld tijdens de studie Moeders van Morgen, een onderzoek uitgevoerd door de Universiteit Leiden. Er is gebruik gemaakt van de DoG computertaak, de DoG naturalistische vraag en de CHAOS-vragenlijst. Participanten die een antwoord gaven bij de DoG naturalistische vraag die geassocieerd wordt met meer zelfcontrole, kozen significant vaker voor antwoorden in de DoG computertaak die geassocieerd worden met meer zelfcontrole. Het verwachte verband tussen zelfcontrole en chaos is niet gevonden. Vervolgonderzoek, waarbij meer participanten, andere meetinstrumenten om zelfcontrole te meten en meerdere observaties van chaos aanbevolen zijn, is noodzakelijk.",

Overgewicht en obesitas zijn een groot probleem in Nederland en wereldwijd. Responsief en sensitief gedrag van ouders betrekking tot verzadigingssignalen tijdens de maaltijd zou mogelijk kunnen bijdragen aan het verminderen van overgewicht en obesitas. De VIPP-FI is ontwikkeld om ouders deze voedingsstijl aan te leren. Deze scriptie onderzoekt aan de hand van een gerandomiseerd onderzoek met controlegroep de effectiviteit van deze interventie. Het onderzoek bestaat uit 124 moederkind paren, waarvan 61 in de VIPP-groep en 64 in de controlegroep. Er wordt gebruik gemaakt van de pretest (T0) en posttest (T18) observatiedata. De responsiviteit voor verzadigingssignalen werd gescoord op een schaal speciaal ontwikkeld voor dit onderzoek en sensitiviteit aan de hand van de Ainsworth sensitiviteitsschaal. Uit de analyses die zijn gedaan is gebleken dat er geen effect is van de VIPP-FI op responsiviteit voor verzadigingssignalen of sensitiviteit tijdens het eetmoment. Voor sensitiviteit geldt er echter wel dat er een trend is gevonden die wijst op wat er vanuit de literatuur wordt verwacht. Er is een samenhang gevonden tussen sensitiviteit tijdens het eetmoment en spelmoment, dit is echter maar een klein tot gemiddeld positief verband. Verder heeft de VIPP-FI ook geen effect gehad op de sensitiviteit tijdens het spelmoment. Een mogelijke verklaren voor het feit dat er geen effect van de VIPP-FI is gevonden, is dat alle moeders in zowel de VIPP-groep als de controlegroep het al redelijk goed doen op responsiviteit verzadiging en sensitiviteit. Het is aan te bevelen meer onderzoek te doen naar de effectiviteit van de VIPP-FI, waarbij wordt gecontroleerd op achtergrond variabelen die mogelijk een invloed hebben. Tevens valt aan te bevelen om onderzoek te doen naar de factoren die de variantie in verklaren van het verschil in sensitiviteitsscores op eetmoment en spelmoment.",

Effects of Namaste Care Family Program on Challenging Behavior,"Vliem, Esther","['Houdt, C. van', 'Habers, E.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Challenging behavior, shown by people with severe dementia, can be experiences as stressful for the nursing staff, family caregivers, volunteers and it also has a negative impact on the quality of life of the person with dementia. The Namaste Care Family (NCF) program is a person-centered, multisensory intervention which makes use of palliative care methodologies and emphasizes the involvement of family carers and volunteers. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of the NCF program on challenging behavior in people with severe dementia (N = 231). This longitudinal study is part of a large cluster-randomized controlled trial that examines the effects of the NCF program. In this study, 19 nursing homes from across the Netherlands participated of which 10 nursing homes implemented the NCF program (n = 116) and 9 nursing homes served as control group (n = 115). The implementation of the NCF program started after the baseline assessment in the nursing homes. The follow-up assessments were after 1 month, 3, 6 and 12 months. Challenging behaviors were measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. Mixed models were used to analyze the overall effect of the intervention on 12 symptoms of challenging behavior and three clusters. The False Discovery Rate was used to correct for multiple testing. The intervention group showed more depressive symptoms in the follow-up assessments than the control group on average. The depressive symptoms showed a significant difference if controlled for confounders of 0.33, p = 0.001, with a 95% Confidence Interval of [0.16, 0.50]. The NCF program had no significant effect on 10 of the 12 symptoms. The results for the three clusters were also not significant. To conclude, challenging behavior did not reduce as a result of the NCF program. Depressive symptoms were shown more in the intervention group after receiving NCF. Therefore, it is important to do more research into the NCF program to clarify if and which components of the Namaste sessions have a possible positive or negative effect on symptoms of challenging behavior in order to specify the NCF program.",

Does Cognitive Load Follow the Sun? A Study to Explore the Existence of Temporal Patterns in Cognitive Load Measures,"Ouda, Sahar","['Ghosh, A.', 'Samara, I.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The level of mental effort when performing everyday activities depends on many factors, and it is constrained by the working memory capacity. Factors such as the type of work, the work schedule, and special events like exams, deadlines, or holidays may cause temporary increases or decreases to the cognitive load of daily routines. Given the dominance of circadian clocks in human behaviours and cognitive output, is mental effort also consistently influenced by the time of day? This study explored the possibility that cognitive load fluctuates in a consistent temporal pattern that is close to diurnal cycles observed in human behaviour and cognition. The approach was based on the assumption that smartphones tapping data can act as a proxy for cognitive load levels in order to capture the daily dynamic changes unobtrusively and in vivo. The sample data was collected from 64 healthy individuals, with a duration period on average of 33 days. A spectral analysis on the time-series of the tapping sessions revealed the existence of a diurnal cycle of 24 h in both low and high cognitive load measures, with no significant differences in the cycles’ amplitude. This suggests that people distribute their mental effort consistently across the day with similar intensity between activities that require low and high cognitive resources. This finding was again confirmed at the individual level by a cross correlation analysis. Interestingly, the participants exhibit barely visible weekly cycles with relatively weak signals, which could be a reflection of the time of the study during coronavirus lockdown; hence the influence of weekday/weekend rhythm may be diminished. Further research should examine the time of day when cognitive load peaks and declines, as well as the individual differences. The information can be valuable for various domains that are concerned with learning, performance and health.","['cognitive load', 'cognitive load theory', 'mental effort', 'performance', 'circadian rhythms', 'diurnal cycles', 'smartphones']"
Understanding the Discrepancy Between Smartphone Log Data and Self-Reported Behaviour,"Harmsen, Ana","['Ghosh, A.', 'Samara, I.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Smartphones have become an integral part of our daily lives. Along with this integration comes a concern for smartphone and internet addictions. In order to fully understand how these addictions might work, it is imperative that we develop more accurate measures of smartphone behaviours. Past studies have often included selfreported questionnaires that gathered data about the duration of smartphone use and other smartphone behaviours, but it is now known that self-reports are not entirely reliable. This study will investigate the difference between the self-reported duration of smartphone use and the actual duration provided by the users’ smartphones. Additionally, the study will explore the possibility of habitual checking behaviours as a predictor of recall error. Data collected from 122 participants were analysed via one-sample t-tests and multiple linear regressions. Results from the one-sample ttests support previous research, showing that participants were indeed inaccurate at recalling the time spent on their phones. Thus, smartphones are an important tool for providing objective data on smartphone behaviour. Contrary to former research, the level of smartphone usage did not make a difference on the amount of recall error, such that participants were inaccurate regardless of actual time spent on their smartphones. The multiple linear regressions found a relationship between one measure of time-based checking habits and recall error, but not between tap-based checking habits and recall error. These results indicate that unconscious, automatic smartphone habits may play a role in the inability to accurately recall smartphone behaviour.","['smartphones', 'checking habits', 'self-report', 'bias', 'log data', 'recall error']"
Self-Reported Data vs Log Data: Factors Influencing Self-Report of Smartphone Use Duration,"Lohrmann, Philipp","['Samara, I.', 'Ghosh, A.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Smartphone use duration is associated with serious health consequences such as depression, anxiety, and addiction. To examine to which degree smartphone use duration affects the health of individuals, self-report measurements are used to determine smartphone use duration. However, self-report measurements of smartphone use duration are prone to inaccuracy, since people seem to have a distorted time perception while using the smartphone. The aim of this study is to find a discrepancy between actual smartphone use duration and reported smartphone use duration, by considering two time references, per day and yesterday. Furthermore, the study investigated whether higher smartphone use duration and higher number of unique apps increase the discrepancy between the actual and reported smartphone use duration. This study used a survey containing the questions; “For how many min per day do you use your phone? For how many min did you use your phone yesterday?” and using the log data captured by a tracker app. From 122 respondents, 97 individuals were eligible for inclusion in the study. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that individuals tend to inaccurately recall their smartphone use duration. However, contradictory to earlier findings this study proposes that greater smartphone use duration per day is negatively associated with the transformed relative recall error per day. The number of unique apps use predicted transformed relative recall error yesterday significantly positively. Future research should aim at focusing on reliable measurements for smartphone use duration in order to investigate the association between smartphone use duration and health consequences in more depth.",

Co-Morbid Substance Use in Psychotic Disorder: The Role of a Neurocognitive Dysfunction,"Hernaus, Elsemieke","['Ruitenberg, M.', 'Hiele, K. van der']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background and aims: Psychotic disorders (PD) are often accompanied by substance (ab)use. Recent studies demonstrated a connection between these conditions through a common neurocognitive dysfunction. This common dysfunction concerns the executive functions (EF). Through this way it affects both cognitive control and mechanisms of motivation/reward. An EF dysfunction is a core feature of both PD and substance (ab)use. Moreover, it is found to be present prior to the onset of both conditions. It is suggested that this common EF dysfunction highlights a vulnerability for comorbidity. Hence, this study investigated whether a common neurocognitive dysfunction is associated to the co-morbidity of substance (ab)use and PD. Investigating EF in co-morbidity is especially relevant for theories of aetiology, prevention and treatment. First, we examined whether poor EF predicts an increase in substance use in PD patients. Second, we examined whether poor EF, combined with substance use, predicts an increase in substance dependency. Methods: This crosssectional study included 90 patients diagnosed with PD (18-65 years). Data were obtained through self-report questionnaires that measured EF, substance use and -dependency. Three multiple linear regression analyses were calculated to evaluate whether EF scores predicted substance use; three moderated binary logistic regression analyses were calculated to evaluate whether EF scores, moderated by substance use, predicted substance dependency. Findings: Results showed that Initiative deficits predicted substance use (p=.01). Deficits of Emotional regulation (p=.04) and Working memory (p=.03), moderated by substance use, predicted a decrease of dependency. Conclusions: Our results partially confirmed that poor EF predicted substance use and -dependency in PD. It did not lend sufficient support for the idea that the co-morbidity of substance (ab)use and PD is associated with a common EF dysfunction. Nevertheless, results demonstrated a relation between EF and substance (ab)use, namely that PD patients use substances as a means of self-medication in order to cope with an EF dysfunction. It can be concluded that this self-medicative behaviour promotes the development of co-morbid substance (ab)use in PD. This study offers new insights into the selfmedication hypothesis. It demonstrated that, besides psychotic symptoms, an EF dysfunction induces self-medicative substance use in PD. Clinical implications may concern prevention techniques and treatment methods.","['Co-morbidity', 'Substance use', 'Psychotic disorder']"

The Role of Expectancies in a Heat Pain Conditioning Paradigm Within Deceptive and Open Label Placebos,"Zelčs, Armands","['Smits, R.', 'Habers, E.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Conditioning response theory and expectancy theory are primary explanatory models of placebo effect formation within deceptive placebo (DP) paradigm and considered either independent from each other (Voudouris, 1990) or related in a form of mediation (Wager, 2005). Additionally, recent development of open-label placebo (OLP) framework has made it possible to apply placebos in clinical practice in a more ethical way while also raising the question as to what enables to observe the placebo effect in this paradigm since the deception is not used. The latter questions the hypothesis of expectancy mediation that holds that placebo occurs when a subject expects it to. Therefore, this study will investigate the role of expectancies in a conditioned placebo response within OLP and DP paradigms. In this study it was hypothesized that 1) conditioning would result in positive placebo effect in both experimental groups, 2) mediating role of expectancies in conditioning shaped placebo effects was hypothesized to be observed when OLP and DP groups scores are combined and 3) mediation of expectancies should be observed in DP group but not in OLP group. To address these hypotheses, an interventional single blinded randomized controlled trial design was used with group differences as between subject factor and activation or deactivation of sham device as within subject factor. Thermal heat pain was used for pain induction. To elicit placebo effects, conditioning procedure together with relevant verbal suggestions about the sham device were delivered. Together, 88 participants were tested with no baseline differences in age, gender, warmth and pain thresholds, and applied temperatures. Conditioning successfully predicted placebo outcome measures. Mediation analysis revealed that expectancies partially mediated conditioning-placebo effect relationship in DP, but not in OLP groups. The findings signify the different mechanisms in DP and OLP framework and points to possible future research directions. Ultimately, full understanding of placebo effects would allow for better treatment of people with chronic conditions, such as chronic pain.",
Reactive Aggression and Emotion Regulation Ability in Borderline Personality Disorder and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,"Goossens, Annemarie","['Krause-Utz, A.', 'Witlox, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Emotion regulation difficulties and impulsive aggression are common occurrences in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients, often leading to interpersonal problems. Traumatic childhood experiences may further negatively affect adaptive functioning and quality of life in these populations in various ways. The current study aimed to elucidate the relationships between these three factors, specifically investigating if emotion regulation difficulties predict impulsive aggression and if childhood trauma severity moderates this relationship. Methods: A total of 87 all-female participants aged 18-50, divided into healthy control (HC) (n = 30), BPD (n = 29), and ADHD (n = 28) groups, completed two self-report questionnaires; the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Additionally, the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP) was applied, which assesses impulsive aggressive behaviors in response to provocation. Results: Neither patient group scored higher on measures of impulsive aggression than controls, and emotion regulation difficulties did not predict impulsive aggression. A model where childhood trauma severity moderates the relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and impulsive aggression was also insignificant. Unexpectedly, childhood trauma severity did positively predict impulsive aggression on its own. Conclusions: The fact that these results partially contradict previous research calls for replications of this study with more representative samples and in-depth analyses of the factors involved (e.g. taking into account differences between various types of aggression, emotion regulation skills, or abuse/neglect). The finding that childhood trauma severity predicts impulsive aggression appears to be a relative novelty, and should be investigated further.",
Open Label and Deceptive Placebo Ana lgesia: The Role of Expectations and Optimism,"Parlevliet, Nadine","['Smits, R.', 'Habers, E.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Within placebo research, a discussion has arisen on whether hiding the true nature of this inert treatment is deceptive. Therefore, the administration of an ‘open-label placebo’ (OLP) was introduced, a more ethical way to administer the inert treatments by disclosing the intentions of the placebo. Research focusing on the underlying mechanisms of the placebo effect, i.e. the inclusion of classical conditioning, enhancing expectations with verbal suggestions and personality factors such as optimism has yet to focus on the role of these mechanisms in OLP groups. The present study investigated whether there is a difference between OLP and deceptive placebo (DP) effects in experimentally induced heat pain in healthy individuals. Additionally, the role of pain expectations and optimism was studied for both groups. Sixty participants received pain induced by thermal stimuli and were randomized into two groups. For the OLP group, the analgesic placebo device was described as inert and conditioning happened by reducing the stimulus intensity. For the DP group, the placebo device was described as analgesic and conditioning also happened. Pain ratings and expectations were measured verbally throughout the procedure. Optimism was measured with the LOT-R. Placebos were measured by comparing pain for non-placebo and placebo stimuli. Results showed no difference between OLP and DP groups (F(1, 58) = .155, p = .695, ηp2 = .003). Analgesic placebo effects were found for both groups (F(1, 58) = 26.111, p < .005, ηp2 = .310). Expectations significantly predicted the placebo effect in the DP group (β = -.348; t(27) = -5.153, p < .05), and the OLP group, however for which the results needed to be interpreted with caution., This implies that higher pain expectations led to smaller placebo effects. No effect for optimism was found. Results suggest that both OLP and DP groups produce a similar analgesic effect. This finding implies that in future treatments, it could be considered to use OLP versions of placebo treatments as a more ethical and efficient version of the deceptive placebo treatments. Future research could further specify the individual characteristics that could enhance the success of placebo treatments in a more ethical way.",

An Examination of Peer Feedback Influence in Socially Anxious Students: Does positive feedback from peer influence positive and negative affect in high anxious students?,"Nandyane, Raisa","['Miers, A.', 'Mansson, S.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The current study aimed to investigate the influence of positive feedback from peers on positive and negative affect in highly socially anxious students. High social anxiety is related to low positive affect and high negative affect. Positive affect is considered as a global and unidimensional factor that refers to valence and not to a specific positive emotion, that makes life enjoyable and also contributes in the increase of psychological flexibility and social bonds development. In the present study, 40 university students were asked to perform a speech task and received positive or neutral feedback from two individuals of the same age immediately after the speech. In order to see whether there are changes in positive affect and negative affect, each affect was measured at two time points, session one and session two with a 1-week interval. Results showed that participants who received positive feedback interpreted the feedback more positively than participants who received neutral feedback. There was no significant difference between positive and neutral feedback conditions on the positive affect and negative affect levels. Furthermore, positive affect seemed to decrease from the first to second session regardless of the feedback received, and negative affect was relatively stable. These findings are in contrast to previous findings regarding social anxiety and social feedback with positive valence in social situations. Our results suggest that people with social anxiety do attend to positive social situations but that this does not necessarily influence the way they feel to be more positive.","['peer feedback', 'positive affect', 'negative affect', 'social anxiety']"

The Lack of Influence of Financial Incentives and Framing on Physical Activity Increase and Unrelatedness of Self-Efficacy,"Ebben-Wildermuth, Sarah","['Buisonjé, David de']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Interventions for increasing physical activity (PA) are using various forms of encouragement. Those means of motivation include financial incentives (FIs) in the form of rewards allocated or a previously transferred deposit being earned back as well as feedback framing to either highlight gains or losses. Furthermore, factors influencing PA are increasingly examined, with one being self-efficacy (SE) which represents confidence in one’s own capability. Current study: An experimental study was conducted aiming at increasing the participants’ daily step count to investigate the effect of framing and FIs as well as SE on PA increase. Methods: A 2x2 design with a reward gain, reward loss, deposit gain and deposit loss as well as a control condition was used. A sample of mostly young students living in the Netherlands (N = 91) was divided randomly across those five groups. The participants used an app for 20 days which provided them daily feedback matching their condition on their step count in comparison to their goal. Results: A two-way ANOVA displayed no effect of FIs (p = .16), framing (, p = .10), or the interaction thereof (p = .69). Furthermore, SE did not predict the days of goal achievement (p = .80). Discussion: No effect of FIs or framing on PA was found. SE did not influence the performance within the intervention. Caution is advised when interpreting the results due to unmet assumptions. Further research to clarify the discrepancies and investigate underlying mechanisms of PA increasing interventions is necessary.",

In doing so, the salience of certain topics is often heightened through the process of framing. This process is of extreme importance as it shapes the understanding that the general public has of a health emergency. Identifying what frames prevail in the first phases of an epidemic can help define the major worries of the elite as well as the general public as well as their priorities. While the world is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, this study is aimed at delineating how processes of framing were used by British the printed press. By distinguishing trends in tabloids and broadsheet newspapers, this research will be able to conclude that sensationalist newspapers presented more human interest stories. On the other hand, serious newspapers were found to make larger use of the Economic Consequences and the Attribution of Responsibility frames. Additionally, anchoring frames were found to prevail over othering hence confirming the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic would less “othered” than 2003 SARS.",

The Effect of Humanitarian and National-Interest Frames on Public Opinion,"Schrader, Chiara","['Meffert, M.F.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The research conducted in this thesis focused on different frames found in the news reporting of international and national media on the Australian asylum-seeker policy of ‘offshore processing’. Firstly, a content analysis into the news reporting on this subject was undertaken, and it was found that international newspapers such as The Guardian, The New York Times and The Daily Mail assumed a watchdog position, pushing them to use a humanitarian frame. This is in contrast to national newspapers such as The Australian, which assumed more of a lapdog position, pushing them to use a national-interest frame. Subsequently, an experiment was conducted to assess whether these different frames influence public opinion. Respondents with no previous knowledge on the subject were asked to participate in a survey experiment. They were assigned to two different groups – one being exposed to humanitarian framed articles, the other being exposed to national-interest framed articles. The results showed a preliminary direction that public opinion takes, as the group exposed to the humanitarian frame was more negative towards the Australian asylum-seeker policy, and the group exposed to the national-interest frame was more positive towards the Australian asylum-seeker policy. Essentially, more agency must be accredited to the media and the public, in the hope of encouraging a more humanitarian tone towards highly politicised issues.",

Alt-Right and Mainstream Media Coverage of the Outbreak of the Corona Crisis: A Comparative Analysis of US and Dutch Online Media Platforms,"Stroeks, Maaike","['Meffert, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Over the past years, a network of alt-right media platforms has emerged online that have attracted significant popularity and readership in Western democracies. Through their antiestablishment and right-wing ideology, these platforms have provided challenges towards trust in mainstream media and liberal democracy. Historically, populism has tended to rise during times of crisis, meaning that the outbreak of the corona pandemic provides potential new breeding ground for its idealism. To get a better picture of how these platforms operate on the Internet, this thesis aims to analyse alt-right and mainstream media coverage of the corona crisis through a comparative analysis of online news articles by the Dagelijkse Standaard and NOS in the Netherlands, and Breitbart and CNN in the United States. Through a content analysis of 842 articles, it researches media coverage by looking at the dominant crisis frames (i.e. the ‘conflict’, ‘responsibility’, ‘morality’, ‘economic-consequences’ and ‘humanitarian-interest’frame), the persons and institutions that were quoted in the texts and what the tone of the quote sand overall articles was with regard to the government’s handling of the crisis. Altogether, it concludes that there were significant differences in media coverage of the corona crisis between mainstream and alt-right media platforms. Indeed, alt-right media framed the corona crisis in more anti- or pro-establishment terms than their mainstream counterparts. This means that news consumers consulting either alt-right or mainstream media were differently informed on their governments performance, which affects their ability to hold the government accountable for its conduct and the responsiveness of the government to the public’s needs. Furthermore, the platforms’ alt-right framing of events raises the concern for the formation of “filter bubbles” that reinforce political polarization, media scepticism and gravitation towards political extremes.","['Online alternative media', 'alt-right media', 'mainstream media', 'crisis coverage', 'corona virus']"

The comportment of the military is of great importance as it shapes a revolt’s outcome. Coups d’état are the traditional indicator for measuring military behaviour. Various domestic and international factors affect the behaviour of the armed forces and thus, coups. This thesis looks at one of the most critical international influencers: foreign military aid. More precisely, it tries to understand how two specific U.S. Foreign Military Assistance programs, the IMET program and the FMF program, affect the behaviour of the recipient African or Middle Eastern military. Data on coup outcome and success are used to measure military behaviour. A cross-national statistical analysis is conducted in 60 countries between 2000 and 2018. The analysis finds that more education and training lead to a smaller chance for a coup to be attempted and to be successful in the recipient country. Furthermore, it finds that as U.S. financing increases, so does the likelihood of a coup. Apart from this, the results indicate a significant positive relationship between the effect of the FMF program on the chances of a coup to be successful.",

Human Trafficking in the European Union: A Case Study of the Netherlands,"Krivonossova, Marina","['Mos, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"While human trafficking is a major issue in every part of the European Union (EU), one Member State – the Netherlands – experiences trafficking rates which surpass those of its fellow EU Members. In 2011, the EU Anti-Trafficking Directive was created with the overall intention of standardizing and implementing measures across the EU to combat human trafficking. The following article aims to explain why the Netherlands maintains exceptionally high human trafficking rates compared to the remainder of EU Member States, even though it has officially signed on to this directive. I examine the situation from a compliance perspective to understand whether causes of non-compliance such as corruption, a lack of benefits associated with complying, or the failure of national regulations to align with international stipulations is responsible. I then see whether the legal status of prostitution impedes the effectiveness of the directive’s stipulations which are directly correlated with variance in human trafficking rates. The time period I focus on is 2000-2020, beginning with the Dutch legalization of prostitution and continuing until the year in which I conduct this study. Doing so allows me to focus on the most recent and relevant information. The overall argument this articles makes is that non-compliance with the EU Anti-Trafficking Directive is not the cause of the Netherlands’ inability to curb human trafficking rates, as the directive actually fails to achieve its desired results due to the legal status of prostitution interfering with its success. I rely on information gathered through a discourse analysis of published data from the European Commission, EU Parliament, news articles, and surveys, along with interviews with Dutch government officials who specialize in the fields of legalized prostitution, human trafficking, and policy development to support this conclusion.",

Geen correlatie tussen de wilskracht overtuiging van mensen en de mate waarin zij om hulp vragen,"van Vonderen, Annoeska Elise","['Weiden, A. van der']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Eerder onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat de uitputting van iemands wilskracht afhankelijk is van diens overtuiging of wilskracht gelimiteerd is. Personen die denken dat wilskracht ongelimiteerd is, zouden eenvoudiger impulsen kunnen onderdrukken. Hierdoor zouden ze efficiënter langetermijndoelen kunnen behalen. Wij verwachtten dat mensen met deze overtuiging anderen minder snel om hulp zouden vragen, omdat zij wellicht denken dat ze alles alleen kunnen. Anderen om hulp vragen heeft echter voordelen, die mensen met een ongelimiteerde wilskrachtovertuiging zouden missen. Voor dit onderzoek is daarom onderzocht of mensen met een ongelimiteerde wilskrachtovertuiging anderen minder snel om hulp vragen. Dit is onderzocht door middel van online vragenlijsten, bestaande uit 12 vragen over wilskrachtovertuiging en 12 vragen over anderen om hulp vragen. Deze variabelen bleken zwak gecorreleerd, waarbij toeval niet kon worden uitgesloten. Dit onderzoek kon geen verband aantonen tussen wilskrachtovertuiging en de mate waarin diegene anderen om hulp vraagt. Het verwachte negatieve effect van een ongelimiteerde wilskrachtovertuiging kon zodoende ook niet worden aangetoond. Extra onderzoek rondom dit onderwerp is aanbevolen. Zo kan onderzocht worden welke andere eventuele nadelige bijkomstigheden mensen met een ongelimiteerde wilskrachtovertuiging ervaren.",

"The Role of Peer Relationships, Friendship Quality and Self-Esteem in Observational Reinforcement Learning in Adolescence","Bron, Linde","['Koele, I.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"During adolescence peers, especially friends, become increasingly important. These peers can provide each other with learning experiences by observing each other’s behaviour. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of peer relationships, friendship quality and self-esteem on observational reinforcement learning in adolescence. In this study, 232 participants from 10 to 15 years old performed an observational reinforcement learning computer task in four different conditions: individual learning, learning from an unknown peer, learning from a neutral classmate and learning from a friend. In this computer task participants had to learn which of two stimuli had a higher probability of reward. Besides, the participants completed friendship quality questions and a self-esteem questionnaire. A mixed ANOVA showed that adolescents learn significantly better when learning from a peer compared to when learning individually. However, the relationship with this peer (friend, neutral classmate or unknown peer) has no significant effect on reinforcement learning outcomes. Furthermore, our results showed no significant differences in reinforcement learning between adolescents with lower friendship quality and adolescents with higher friendship quality and no significant differences in reinforcement learning between adolescents with a lower self-esteem and adolescents with a higher self-esteem. Our study also did not find a significant interaction effect of peer relationships and friendship quality on observational reinforcement learning and no significant interaction effect of peer relationships and self-esteem on observational reinforcement learning. Thus, our study suggests that adolescents’ learning outcomes are better when they learn with peers, but the relation to the peer whom they learn with matters less. Future studies could further extend the knowledge on the topic of observational reinforcement learning, peer relationships, friendship quality and self-esteem in adolescents by examining cross-cultural differences from early to late adolescence in both a controlled and natural setting.",

What is the influence of self-concept clarity on difficulties regarding study choice?,"Vries, Julian de","['Spaans J.', 'Zanolie, K.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The aim of the current study was to examine the association between self-concept clarity and difficulties with study choice, and examine if general indecisiveness (partially) mediates this relationship. Participants (N = 48, aged 14-20) filled in online questionnaires on self-concept clarity (SCC), general indecisiveness and difficulties with study choice (CDDQ). Regression analyses showed: (1) a positive association between self-concept clarity and difficulties with study choice; (2) a positive association between self-concept clarity and general indecisiveness; (3) a positive association between general indecisiveness and difficulties with study choice; (4) general indecisiveness fully mediated the relationship between self-concept clarity and difficulties with study choice. This implies that general indecisiveness is the most important factor in this mediation model, which is important to know for being able to help students in their decision-making process. Probably the way the constructs were measured plays a large role in explaining our results. Repeating this research with a larger sample in the future is recommended and if this leads to the same results, it is important to further investigate the differences on self-concept clarity and difficulties with study choice between educational groups.","['self-concept clarity', 'study choice', 'general indecisiveness']"
