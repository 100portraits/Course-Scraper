De Relatie Tussen Emotieregulatie en Externaliserend Probleemgedrag bij Jongens met een Extra Y-Chromosoom,"Spaans, Eline","['Oudega, M.H.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Around 1:1000 boys is born with the XYY-syndrome, meaning they are born with an extra Ychromosome. Developmental and behavioral outcomes of some of these boys include increased levels of externalizing behavioral problems and difficulties with emotion regulation, while other boys show no developmental or behavioral problems at all. This study investigates whether boys with the XYYsyndrome have an increased risk of developing externalizing behavioral problems and problems with emotion regulation, whether these outcomes are related to each other, and whether this relationship differs for XYY-boys as compared to normally developing (XY-)boys. This study is of a case control, observational design and is carried out in The Netherlands, Belgium, and the United States. It includes 24 XYY-boys and 44 XY-boys, ranging in age from 1 to 8 years old. Data is collected using questionnaires. Statistical analysis is carried out via independent samples t-tests and multiple regression analyses. The results indicate that although XYY- and XY-boys do not differ regarding their levels of externalizing behavioral problems, XYY-boys do appear to have more – albeit still nonclinical – problems with emotion regulation than XY-boys. Moreover, there exists a positive relationship between problematic emotion regulation and externalizing behavior problems, but this relationship is not different for XYY-boys as compared to XY-boys. Since emotion regulation affects many aspects of human’s daily lives, and since XYY-boys are at higher risk for developing emotion regulation problems, this research suggests to monitor XYY-boys’ emotion regulation development from an early age onwards. This should help to detect problems early and prevent or minimize further developmental risks of XYY-boys. Further research including larger samples should be carried out to more thoroughly examine the risk at emotion regulation problems, externalizing behavioral problems and the relationship between the two in boys with an extra Y-chromosome.","['externaliserend probleemgedrag', 'emotieregulatie', 'XYY-syndroom', 'extra Y-chromosoom']"
"Network Analysis on the Correlation Between Preliminary HiTOP Items of Maladaptive Personality Traits in the Internalizing Spectrum and Symptoms of Depression, Anxiety & Stress","Meyer, Sven Eric","['Rieble, C.L.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Personality is predictive of the development of psychopathology. The Hierarchical Topology of Psychopathology (HiTOP) is a new nosology of psychopathology, embracing a transdiagnostic, dimensional approach, in which symptoms define the disorder in a bottom-up manner. It aims to include dimensions of personality traits. Recently, preliminary items for maladaptive personality traits of the internalizing spectrum have been developed. This study aims to explore the validity and influence of these novel items by correlating them with symptoms of three major internalizing disorders (MDD, GAD, stress) in cross-sectional network analysis. The data is gathered from self-reports of 453 active students within the Netherlands. All items had a positive relationship with each other. The individual maladaptive traits correlated positively with different types of disorders. Some items had a moderately strong correlation with each other. While cross-sectional analyses do not allow to draw inferences about directionality and causality, they suggest the explored items to be correlating with psychopathology and thus as valid measurements. Future research is suggested to perform longitudinal network analysis on HiTOP items to map out maladaptive personality traits to prevent the development of mental disorders and find targets for clinical interventions.","['Network analysis', 'Hierarchical Topology of Psychopathology (HiTOP)', 'personality traits']"

Spelend leren in groep 3: Hoe staan onderwijsprofessionals van de onderbouw tegenover het inzetten van spelend leren in groep 3?,"Kruiff, Hannah de","['Jolles, D.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In de literatuur is weinig bekend over het inzetten van spelend leren in groep 3, daarom is het belangrijk om te weten hoe onderwijsprofessionals tegenover het inzetten van spelend leren staan. Dus is er onderzoek gedaan met de onderzoeksvraag: ‘Hoe staan onderwijsprofessionals van de onderbouw tegenover het inzetten van spelend leren in groep 3?’ Op basisschool X is er twijfel over de implementatie van spelend leren in groep 3, deze basisschool is gebruikt als case study voor het beantwoorden van de onderzoeksvraag. De gebruikte definitie is een continuüm die bestaat uit: vrij spel, onderzoekend spel, samenwerkend spel, spelenderwijs leren en leren door spelletjes. Dit spel loopt van ongestructureerd, waarbij de leerkracht een passieve rol heeft, naar gestructureerd, waarbij de leerkracht een actieve rol heeft. Er zijn vijf interviews afgenomen met onderwijsprofessionals die betrokken zijn bij de onderbouw van Basisschool X. De interviews zijn afgenomen aan de hand van een topic guide, vervolgens getranscribeerd en gecodeerd. De resultaten zijn vergeleken met de literatuur over spelend leren. De onderwijsprofessionals zien voordelen van spelend leren, namelijk het vergroten van de woordenschat, het verwerken van informatie en het vergroten van de motivatie. Een nadeel is dat spelend leren niet genoeg is voor het aanleren van complexe vaardigheden. De onderwijsprofessionals voelden zich competent om spelend leren in te zetten, maar zien wel uitdagingen in een tekort aan tijd, middelen en/of ruimte. Dus de onderwijsprofessionals lijken een positieve houding te hebben ten opzichte van het inzetten van spelend leren in groep 3.","['spelend leren', 'groep 3', 'implementatie', 'vrij spel', 'onderzoekend spel', 'samenwerkend spel', 'leren door spelletjes']"

Threat and attention: Effects of other-directed punishments on automatic attentional performance,"Arantila, Kerkko",['Mulckhuijse M.G.J'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the speed and accuracy of visual spatial attention can be enhanced when one’s performance is incentivized with punishments or rewards toward oneself. The primary objective of the present study was to determine whether this motivational effect on exogenous attentional performance is extended to situations where others’ physical integrity is at risk. Second, we aimed to determine whether one’s sensitivity to punishments, as measured by the Behavioral Inhibition Scale (BIS), has an enhancing effect on attentional performance in threatening conditions. To probe these questions, we set up a dyad experiment, in which one participant completed an exogenous spatial cueing task. During the task, we manipulated participant motivation by the threat of electric shocks directed either toward the task performer, their co-participant, or neither. The shock delivery was based on the performer’s task performance. Our results showed no differences in performance between the three conditions. This contradicted our hypotheses and suggests that other-directed or self-directed threat does not lead to increased automatic attentional performance. Regarding BIS, we found that high-BIS individuals, relative to low-BIS individuals, have increased attentional reaction times during other-directed threat, but not during self-directed threat. This finding also contradicted our hypothesis. Therefore, we suggest that high sensitivity to punishments may lead to poorer attentional performance when others are at risk.","['attention', 'threat', 'behavioral inhibition']"

Rol van Mentoren: Een onderzoek naar de rol van de mentor in het voorzien van sociaal-emotionele behoeften van havo- en vwo-leerlingen in het eindexamenjaar.,"Tongeren, Julia van","['Vogelaar, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek is onderzocht in welke mate de mentor leerlingen in het eindexamenjaar op dit moment in hun sociaal-emotionele behoeften voorziet en welke behoeften leerlingen hierin nog hebben. Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd in opdracht van pedagogisch bureau OOK, zodat ze een effectieve training voor mentoren kunnen (door)ontwikkelen. De sociaal-emotionele behoeften van leerlingen zijn uitgesplitst in drie basisbehoeften; competentie, autonomie en sociale verbondenheid. Deze basisbehoeften zijn gebaseerd op de Self-Determination Theory van Deci en Ryan (2000). De volgende deelvragen zijn onderzocht: “Welke sociaal-emotionele behoeften van leerlingen op het gebied van autonomie, sociale verbondenheid en competentie worden momenteel vervuld door de mentor?”, “Hebben leerlingen het meest behoefte aan mentor ondersteuning op het gebied van competentie, autonomie of sociale verbondenheid?”, “Verschilt de mate waarin leerlingen behoefte hebben aan ondersteuning van de mentor van de mate waarin zij hierin worden vervuld?” en “Verschillen leerlingen op basis van onderwijsniveau en profielachtergrond in de mate waarin zij voorzien worden en behoefte hebben aan autonomie, sociale verbondenheid en competentie?”. Aan het onderzoek hebben 66 eindexamenleerlingen van de havo en vwo deelgenomen. Voor de participanten was een minimale leeftijd van 16 jaar vereist. De onderzoekspopulatie bestond uit 17 mannen, 48 vrouwen en 1 ‘anders’. De verdeling van het niveau van de populatie bestond uit 29 havisten en 37 vwo’ers. Het vakkenprofiel dat wordt gevolgd door de betreffende respondenten is een natuurprofiel of een maatschappijprofiel. In de onderzoekspopulatie volgden 36 respondenten een natuurprofiel en 30 respondenten een maatschappijprofiel. De scholen zijn geworven binnen het netwerk van de onderzoekers en door scholen op het internet te zoeken en deze te benaderen, waarbij alle scholen binnen de provincie Zuid-Holland of Utrecht lagen. De vragenlijst is gebaseerd op de Mentor Evaluation Tool en de Work-Related Scale for Basic Need Satisfaction. In de vragenlijst zijn de drie basisbehoeften van de Self-Determination Theory - autonomie, competentie en sociale verbondenheid - uitgevraagd. Daarnaast zijn ook de achtergrondvariabelen gender, school, onderwijsniveau en profiel en school uitgevraagd. De eerste deelvraag liet zien dat leerlingen op dit moment gemiddeld het meest voorzien worden in autonomie door hun mentor en het minst in competentie en sociale verbondenheid. De tweede deelvraag liet zien dat leerlingen gemiddeld het meest behoefte hebben aan begeleiding bij competentie en autonomie en het minste behoefte hebben aan begeleiding bij sociale verbondenheid. Hieruit volgde dat er een verschil is in constructen tussen de behoefte van leerlingen en mate waarin zij hier huidig in worden vervuld. Er zijn tegen de verwachting in geen significante verschillen gevonden in behoeften van leerlingen van havo of vwo en leerlingen met een natuur- of maatschappijprofiel. Het advies is om als mentor meer aandacht te besteden aan de ondersteuning van eindexamenleerlingen in hun autonomie en competentie en in mindere mate in de onderlinge sociale verbondenheid. Het is belangrijk dat de leerlingen het gevoel hebben dat zij zelf de vrijheid hebben om keuzes te maken en dat zij genoeg zelfvertrouwen hebben om hun eindexamens te halen. Hier kan OOK aan bijdragen door deze handvatten in trainingen aan te bieden aan mentoren, waarbij met verschillende modules kan worden ingegaan op de ondersteuning in autonomie en competentie. Hoewel de meeste leerlingen aangeven dezelfde behoefte voor competentie en autonomie te hebben, zijn er ook mogelijk onderlinge verschillen. Het is daarom interessant om toekomstig onderzoek te richten op de persoonskenmerken van leerlingen, zodat er mogelijk uitspraken kunnen worden gedaan over specifieke behoeften van een eindexamenleerling.","['Mentor', 'Mentoren', 'Eindexamenleerling', 'Middelbare school', 'Sociaal-emotionele behoeften', 'Self-Determination Theory']"
Hoe langdurig vasten de mentale flexibiliteit negatief beïnvloedt: Over het effect van vasten op de wisselkost en de afwezigheid van verschil in wisselkost tussen mannen en vrouwen in zowel een controle- als een vastengroep,"Zinzen, Indy",['Dr. Guido Band en Dr. Eline Dekeyster'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze studie onderzocht het effect van langdurig vasten (72 uur) op de wisselkost en het verschil in wisselkost tussen mannen en vrouwen in zowel een controle- als een vastengroep. Er is gebruik gemaakt van zowel een between- als within subject design waarin 44 participanten (28 controleparticipanten en 16 vastenparticipanten waarvan 15 mannen en 29 vrouwen) hebben deelgenomen aan een online taakwissel test. De reactietijden zijn gemeten en de wisselkost is berekend, en deze is gemeten als een maat van mentale flexibiliteit. De reactietijden bij wisseltaken zijn hoger dan de reactietijden bij herhaaltaken. Vasten leidt tot een significant hogere wisselkost (p = .021); echter, er is geen verschil in wisselkost tussen mannen en vrouwen in zowel een gevoede als een ongevoede staat. Deze resultaten demonstreren dat vasten een verhogend effect heeft op de wisselkost en hiermee een negatief effect heeft op de mentale flexibiliteit, en dat er geen verschil bestaat in wisselkost tussen mannen en vrouwen in zowel een controle- als een vastenconditie. Verhoogde cortisol- en stress levels zouden een verklaring kunnen zijn voor een verhoogde wisselkost tijdens vasten. Een aanbeveling voor vervolgonderzoek zou zijn om de studie in een experimentele setting af te nemen om te voorkomen dat participanten stoppen met de studie en om cortisollevels te kunnen meten. Een andere aanbeveling zou zijn en om gevarieerder te rekruteren wat betreft leeftijd en opleidingsniveau om de resultaten representatiever te maken voor de populatie.",
Vasten en mentale scherpte: Een analyse van de invloed van vasten (tot 72 uur) op mentale energie en executieve functies door middel van een taakwisselparadigma,"Tjepkema, Dominique",['Guido Band & Eline Dekeyster'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het effect van vasten (tot 72 uur) op mentale scherpte is onderzocht door gerapporteerde mentale energie en prestatie op een taakwisselparadigma te analyseren. Een vastengroep (N = 17) en controlegroep (N = 30) namen naast vragenlijsten een taakwisselparadigma af op drie testmomenten: 24 uur voor de vast (of voorbereidingsfase), 24 uur in de vast en 72 uur in de vast. De volgende onderzoeksvragen zijn onderzocht: 1) Zijn er verschillen tussen de zelfrapportage van mentale energie over de tijd heen tijdens vasten? 2) Is er een samenhang tussen zelfrapportage van mentale energie en reactietijd (RT) en error (ER) op een taakwisselparadigma? en 3) Is er een effect van vasten op de wisselkosten tijdens een wisseltaak? Er is geen effect gevonden van tijd op mentale energie tijdens vasten. Daarnaast is er gekeken naar samenhang van RT en ER (beide op wissel- en herhaaltrials) en mentale energie waarbij er geen correlaties werden gevonden. Om het effect van vasten op wisselkosten te analyseren is naar de verschilscores van RT en ER gekeken. Hier werd enkel een effect van tijd en groep op RT gevonden (p < 0,05), er is in dus geen verschuiving van de snelheid accuratesse trade-off gevonden. Enkele niet-significante trends in deze scriptie suggereren dat de vastengroep mogelijk verbeterde mentale scherpte ervaart. Dat er geen significante relaties zijn gevonden tussen vasten en mentale scherpte is mogelijk het gevolg van tekortkomingen, zoals een kleine experimentele groep, in de huidige studie.","['Vasten, mentale scherpte, mentale energie, wisselkosten, taakwisselparadigma.']"
Opvoeding en Alcoholmisbruik bij Adolescenten die Kindermishandeling of andere Jeugdtrauma’s hebben meegemaakt.,"Slager, Joanne","['Van Harmelen, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"The way children are raised, and particularly a negative parenting environment, is suggested to be a key factor in the development of alcohol abuse in adolescence. With alcohol abuse being a danger to adolescents’ health, social, and professional life, it is of the highest importance to find ways to prevent adolescent alcohol abuse before it’s onset. The current study focusses on adolescents with a past of negative family environments. The study measures parenting environment and alcohol use with a combination of the Measure of Parenting Style (MOPS) questionnaire, the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ) and the Drugs, Alcohol and Self-Injury Inventory (DASI), and researches with regression if having experienced more overall negative parenting is a predictor for more alcohol use in adolescence. Secondly, gender was taken into account as a dummy variable, which made it possible to research possible differences in relationships between parenting and alcohol use in female and male adolescents. For both research questions, no significant results were found. In the current study, experienced negative family environments had no influence on the drinking habits of adolescents with a past of child abuse or other youth trauma. While this seems to contradict earlier research, it may also provide us with the new idea that not overall parenting but only specific guidelines concerning alcohol use in parenting help regulate the alcohol use of children later in life.","['Adolescents', 'alcohol abuse', 'parenting', 'childhood trauma']"
Purchase Intentions by Gay Prejudices: A Cross-Sectional Study about the Implicit Belief of Gender Stereotype Inversion,"Heinmüller, Nalini","['Schutter, M.', 'Prasastyoga, B.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Existing literature illustrates the discrimination experienced by workers in occupations viewed as gender-incongruent but fails to account for sexual orientation. Considering the implicit inversion theory that homosexual individuals are viewed to share opposite-sex characteristics, the goal of this research was to answer whether the intention to purchase a female-typed service from a gay-owned business is more likely compared to a male-typed service. Additionally, we investigated whether prejudices against gay men moderate the effect of stereotype inversion. In an international survey, 120 adults rated their purchase intentions from either a gay-owned male- or female-typed service and prejudiced beliefs. Contrary to our expectations, the results demonstrated that purchase intentions were rated equally across both gender-typed services and prejudices had no moderating effect. The hypothesis that purchases intentions decline when prejudices against gay men are present was supported. This article address issues regarding the theory’s compatibility with our rapidly changing society and additional practical implications are discussed.",
Betrokkenheid van kleuters bij interactief voorlezen met e-Prent&ABC en de relatie met woordenschatverwerving,"Kruidhof, Femke","['Dijken, M. J. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Shared book reading is an effective way to support kindergartener’s word learning. Because not every child benefits equally from reading time, effective vocabulary instruction methods 4-Cycle-model and print-referencing are combined with interactive reading of e-books in e-Prent&ABC, and used as an intervention. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of e-Prent&ABC on word acquisition in kindergarten, and to profile the slower classroom word learners with child characteristics like executive functions, phonological awareness, vocabulary, and engagement, to make recommendations for effective shared book reading. Because it was hypothesized that (active) engagement would differ during reading, the effects of active and regular engagement on word acquisition were investigated. In a repeated mixed measured design, four- and five-year-old slower (N = 40) and faster word learners (N = 41) were read three e-storybooks with or without teacher-class interaction and consolidation targeted on the semantic or semantic and phonological aspects of words. Book vocabulary and observed active engagement was higher during interactive reading time in comparison to reading without interaction for all children, and word learning was more effective when words where consolidated on the semantic aspect without paying attention to the phonological aspect. It was hypothesized that phonological consolidation did not target the meaning of words, and therefore increased the cognitive load. Furthermore, slow word learners benefited more from interactive reading than fast learners. Word learning in this group was predicted by active engagement. Fast learners generally had a better developed vocabulary and phonological awareness, but these child characteristics could not explain the differences of book vocabulary between the groups, merely executive functions and engagement predicted word learning. The results confirm previous research with e-Prent&ABC (Van Dijken, 2019) and indicate that all kindergarteners, especially the slow word learners, benefit from interactive e-book reading with visual animations, semantic instruction and print-referencing.","['Woordverwerving', 'Betrokkenheid', 'Kleuters', 'Interactief voorlezen', 'e-Prent&ABC']"

In this study, social attention, Theory of Mind (ToM) and neurobehavioral outcomes are investigated in preschool aged children with SCT compared to typically developing controls. Furthermore, the study aims to explore with a longitudinal design whether social attention and ToM in preschool aged children with SCT can be predictive of neurobehavioral outcomes one year later. Methods: In this study 71 children with SCT (aged 3-7) and 71 typically developing age matched controls participated. The Social Interaction Scanning (SIS) eye tracking paradigm was used to investigate social attention. ToM skills were measured with the ToM subtest of the Developmental NEuroPSYchological Assessment, second edition (NEPSY-II). Neurobehavioral outcomes were measured with the Social Responsiveness Scale, second edition (SRS-2), Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD and Normal behavior (SWAN) and the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) parental questionnaires respectively. Results: Results of the current study show a vulnerability for children with SCT in the domain of social attention to faces and eyes and ToM compared to typically developing controls. Findings are more pronounced for children aged 5-7 years old. Furthermore, children with SCT appear at increased risk for poorer neurobehavioral outcomes. Finally, results of the current study suggest that ToM may have a unique predictive value for social impairment over time, specifically in the domain of social communication and interaction. Secondly, social attention may have a unique predictive value for ADHD symptoms over time. Conclusions: Results indicate that screening of social cognitive functions (around the age of 5-7) and monitoring of neurodevelopmental pathways is important for clinical practice in SCT. In future research the efficacy of early tailored interventions targeting social cognitive skills in SCT can be investigated, to positively influence developmental outcomes of children with SCT.","['SCT', 'Sex Chromosome Trisomy', 'Social Attention', 'Theory of Mind', 'Neurobehavioral Outcomes', 'Trisomy X', 'Klinefelter', 'XYY']"

Understanding the relationships between siblings and the effects they have on a child's development is crucial (Cicirelli, 2013; Yeh & Lempers, 2004). While plenty research exists on the quality of the sibling relationship, less attention has been paid to the contribution of the family system to this relationship (Feinberg, et al., 2011; Brody, 1998). Family systems are structures that contain positions and roles within families (Pfeiffer & In-Albon, 2022), the family size, birth order and the gender of siblings (Walęcka-Matyja, 2016). The present study researches the relationship between aspects within the family system and the quality of the sibling relationship in early adulthood. These aspects are family size, birth order, whether or not they have divorced parents, whether or not they share the same household and the received emotional support of a sibling. This study includes 108 participants between the ages of 18 and 25. They completed an online questionnaire regarding the sibling relationship and the family system. The quality of the sibling relationship is measured using the Lifespan Sibling Relationship Scale. Results show that the received emotional support of a sibling predicts a higher quality of the sibling relationship. Similar results were found for birth order: being a second born predicts a higher prospective quality of the sibling relationship. Furthermore, no direct relationship was found between the other aspects of the family system and the quality of the sibling relationship. However, given the results that were found, insures us it can be concluded that sibling relationships cannot be viewed without considering the context of the larger system (Cox, 2010; Pfeiffer & In-Albon, 2022). In addition there is a recommendation for more research since not all aspects of the family system have been included in this study.","['broer/ zus relatie, gezinsgrootte, geboortevolgorde, scheiding, delen huishouden, ervaren emotionele steun']"
Effects of Ego Depletion on Performance of the Global-Local Task: Reframing Ego Depletion Effects From a Metacontrol State Model Perspective,"Lueders, Wethiwat Sven","['De Luca, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Ego depletion has become a popular and influential theory to explain one of humanity’s biggest limitations. Up until recently, it was thought that cognitive control is fueled by a resource, where continuous expenditure results in ego depletion, but several accounts point out that this resource has not been found or defined. Furthermore, meta-analyses of studies in favor of the resource model have shown potential publication bias, casting doubt on the existence of the resource or ego depletion in its entirety. The goal for this study was to find evidence that re-framing the mechanisms behind ego depletion using the Metacontrol State Model could explain and predict ego depletion effects more efficiently. 59 participants were repeatedly exposed to a Numerical Counting Stroop Task to trigger ego depletion followed by a geometrical Global-Local Task over six blocks. The Global-Local Task was chosen as the dependent variable, as evidence had been found that could be generalized to assume that global-local processing modes and the Metacontrol State Model may have mechanistic overlap. It was hypothesized that RTs and PEs in local trials would increase, and RTs and PEs in global trials would decrease over time in the experimental group. The findings of this study, however, do comply with our hypothesis, instead favoring the null hypothesis. Two ways to interpret our findings are highlighted. Strengths and limitations, including potential online sampling effects, and several empirically novel modifications to our tasks, are discussed. The effects of ego depletion on performance in the GLT were not observed.","['Ego depletion', 'Metacontrol State Model', 'MSM', 'Global-local Task', 'GLT']"

This study was conducted with 81 preschoolers with the average age of five years. Their teachers read three different picture books over a period of three weeks and followed the protocol of the picture books in the three different conditions. A Mixed Repeated Measures ANOVA showed that e-Prent&ABC is more effective in increasing the vocabulary of a preschooler than the Video Book, especially for the low performers. The child factors task engagement and phonological working memory proved to be significant predictors for the number of words learned in e-Prent&ABC. Multiple one-way independent t-tests showed that the preschoolers from the LL-group have a lower phonological working memory, smaller vocabulary and a lower task involvement compared to their classmates (LH-group).

Prosociaal Gedrag bij Universitaire Studenten: De Voorspellende Rol van Extraversie en Dispositional Awe,"IJdema, Jeanine","['Akyüz, R.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek richt zich op de relatie tussen awe, extraversie en prosociaal gedrag. Awe is een emotie die optreedt wanneer individuen worden blootgesteld aan grote stimuli die hun cognitieve kaders overstijgen. Eerdere studies hebben aangetoond dat awe bijdraagt aan prosociaal gedrag door het perspectief van individuen te verbreden naar grotere entiteiten en het eigenbelang te verminderen. Daarnaast suggereert enig onderzoek dat mensen die hoog scoren op extraversie meer geneigd zijn om prosociaal gedrag te vertonen. Het zou goed kunnen dat deze relatie tussen extraversie en prosociaal gedrag deels verklaard kan worden door dispositional awe. Extraversie wordt immers steeds meer in verband gebracht met het ervaren van positieve emoties, waaronder awe. Deze studie onderzocht daarom het mogelijk mediërende effect van dispositional awe op de relatie tussen extraversie en prosociaal gedrag. Een enquête over demografische gegevens en drie gevalideerde zelfrapportage schalen (DPES, BFI, PSA) werd ingevuld door 206 universitaire studenten tussen de 18 en 30 jaar oud. De resultaten van de multipele regressieanalyse tonen aan dat zowel dispositional awe als extraversie significante voorspellers zijn voor prosociaal gedrag. Hierbij bleek dispositional awe de beste voorspeller te zijn voor prosociaal gedrag. Uit de mediatie-analyse komt echter naar voren dat dispositional awe geen mediërend effect heeft op de relatie tussen extraversie en prosociaal gedrag.

Het verschil in rigide gedrag tussen jongens en meisjes: Is er sprake van een verschil in cognitieve flexibiliteit?,"Huisman, José",['C. E. Bergwerff'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Repetitive and restricted behavior has been related to difficulties in cognitive flexibility. However, previous research on differences in repetitive and restricted behavior between gender shows inconsistent results. The current study investigates if there is a difference in repetitive and restricted behavior between boys and girls, and whether this difference could be explained by differences in cognitive flexibility. This study uses the Trail Making Test and Social Responsiveness Scale to examine cognitive flexibility and repetitive and restricted behavior in 18 boys and 13 girls, between 8 and 16 years old. First of all, a Pearson correlation analysis shows no association between cognitive flexibility and repetitive and restricted behavior. Furthermore, an independent t-test shows no differences on parent questionnaires, measuring rigid behavior between boys and girls. Lastly, mediation analysis, using PROCESS, does not result in differences between boys and girls in repetitive and restricted behavior. Cognitive flexibility does not mediate this effect. The results did not provide evidence for a difference between repetitive and restricted behavior between boys and girls, and the difference could not be explained by a difference in cognitive flexibility. However, the current study highlights the importance for future research. It is of great importance to further explore differences in repetitive and restricted behavior between boys and girls, and possible mechanisms explaining this. This study contributes to improvements in clinical health care, because results will contribute to the development of new treatment methods and increased understanding of repetitive and restricted behavioral patterns in children and adolescents at risk.",['Cognitive flexibility']
Interoceptive ability as a predictive screening measure for autism? A study examining whether tasks aimed at measuring interoceptive awareness and interoceptive sensibility can be used as a predictive screening tool for individuals with high autistic trait levels.,"Boom, Emma",['Julia Folz'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Alterations in interoception (i.e., the way in which individuals perceive their bodily signals) have been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). As previous literature points out a negative relationship between ASD and interoception, we anticipated an implication that interoceptive ability could potentially serve as a predictive screening tool for ASD. For this, three major dimensions of interoception were studied, as identified in previous research, namely interoceptive accuracy, interoceptive sensibility and interoceptive awareness. More specifically, this study investigated the relationship between interoceptive awareness and autistic traits levels, and the relationship between interoceptive sensibility and autistic traits levels. Drawing from past research, we expected negative relationships. A total of 63 participants performed a heartbeat discrimination task (HDT) and two questionnaires, one on interoceptive sensibility and one on autistic trait levels. Regression analyses indicated that neither interoceptive sensibility nor interoceptive awareness showed to be a significant predictor of autistic trait levels. Further, exploratory analyses on the relationship between autistic traits and interoceptive accuracy and alexithymia revealed that only alexithymia is predictive of autistic trait levels. This suggests that, while interoceptive ability might not be a good predictor of autistic trait levels and potentially even ASD, alexithymia levels might be. Therefore, future research should further investigate alexithymia in relation to ASD.","['interoceptive ability, interoceptive awareness, interoceptive sensibility, interoceptive accuracy, autistic trait levels']"

More knowledge about these concepts is relevant for early intervention programme-designs, which may decrease problem behaviour. In this study we aimed to assess if emotion recognition is a predictor for affective empathy and if this differs between children in a high-risk group and a control group. Participants were 8-12 year olds recruited by the Preventive Intervention Team in Amsterdam. Children with a (sub)clinical score on externalizing behavioural problems on the Teacher Report Form were assigned to the high-risk group (N = 123, Mage = 10.06 years, 79.7% male) and the control group (N = 43, Mage = 10.30 years, 46.5% male) consisted of children without a clinical score of behavioural problems. Participants completed a shorter version of the Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents questionnaire to measure affective empathy, the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Task-Prosody to measure verbal emotion recognition and the Facial Emotion Recognition to measure non-verbal emotion recognition. The results of the analyses showed a significantly higher score in recognizing non-verbal emotions in the control group than the high-risk group, with a medium effect size. We found no association between emotion recognition and affective empathy in both groups. The results of this study do not support the implementation of early intervention programmes targeting emotion recognition. Our study was however limited by a small study population with a possible selection bias and a narrow measuring instrument for affective empathy.",

P.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background. Financial scarcity has been shown to influence various aspects of life,including financial and health-related preferences. Characterized by a continuous shortage of financial resources, financial scarcity can lead to narrowed attention, increased impulsivity, and a focus on immediate needs, potentially resulting in risk-taking behavior and unhealthy choices. Aim. This study aimed to investigate the effect of perceived financial scarcity on preferences regarding financial and health-related risk behaviors. Methods. In this research, we measured perceived financial scarcity of the participants using PIFS (Dijk et al., 2022) and assessed their propensity to take financial and health-related risks by adapting measures from Dave et al. (2010) and Yang et al. (2022) accordingly. Results. Perceived financial scarcity on its own did not predict health-related and financial risk behavior preferences. With inclusion of covariates financial scarcity increased financial risk behavior preferences. Conclusion. The findings highlight the importance of acknowledging perceived financial scarcity as a substantial factor that influences individuals' cognitive processes, decision-making, and behaviors. The study contributes to the existing literature and provides insights for policymakers and practitioners working in the fields of finance, health, and social welfare.",
"De relatie tussen Pyrrhonisme en gemoedsrust, gemodereerd door het opleidingsniveau","Gameren, Fanny van","['Berg, T. van de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"According to Pyrrhonism, a pyrrhonian lifestyle characterized by the absence of strong beliefs and suspension of judgement, would lead to Ataraxia. This can roughly be translated to peace of mind. In this study Ataraxia was measured using the NE-Q, a questionnaire that measures the presence/absence of strong beliefs. The expected positive relationship was tested between the NE-Q and stress/anxiety, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder -7 (GAD-7). This hypothesis had to be rejected. We also tested whether there was a moderating effect of education level on the relationship between peace of mind and Pyrrhonism. It was hypothesized that a higher level of education would moderate for more pyrrhonistic thinking and more peace of mind. This hypothesis also had to be rejected. It can therefore be concluded from this study that there is no relationship between Pyrrhonism and peace of mind, and that there is no significant moderation of the level of education. Nevertheless, there is strong reason to suspect that significant effects may arise if the design of the study is adjusted and recruitment is broadened.","['Phyrronism, Peace of Mind, Educational Level']"

The aim of the current study was to examine whether this model applies to adolescents (16-24 years old) who have experienced emotional neglect. Dutch adolescents (N = 171) completed an online questionnaire measuring their social competence, friendship support, and depressive symptoms. While emotional neglect appears to be an important risk factor for depressive thoughts, less social support, and fewer social skills in adolescents, the social skills deficit vulnerability model appears to be too simplistic. A moderation-mediation model did not fit the data and as such, no support for the social skills deficit vulnerability model was found in this study. Further research into the mechanisms behind emotional neglect is necessary to design effective interventions and mitigate the consequences of emotional neglect.",

The aim of the present study was to gain knowledge about the relationship between mothers’ traumatic childhood experiences and children’s internalizing problem behavior within families who are victims of severe domestic violence, and if mothers’ Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms reinforce this relationship. Based on previous research it was expected that mothers’ traumatic childhood experiences and children’s internalizing problem behavior were correlated and that this correlation was reinforced when mothers showed more PTSD symptoms. The sample consisted of mother-child dyads (N = 12) who lived in women’s shelters in the Netherlands. Children (NBoys= 7, Ngirls= 5) were aged between 1.5 and 6 years old. The Childhood Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1.5-5, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form (CTQ-SF) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) were used to measure children’s internalizing problem behavior, mothers’ traumatic childhood experiences and mothers’ PTSD symptoms respectively. Contrary to the hypothesis, mothers’ traumatic childhood experiences did not correlate to children’s internalizing problem behavior. Thereby, there was no significant moderation of mothers’ PTSD symptoms in the relationship between mothers’ traumatic childhood experiences and internalizing problem behavior in young children. However, the results did show that the majority of the mothers who stayed in women’s shelters suffer from PTSD symptoms. It could be argued that there was no significant correlation and moderation due to a lack of statistical power and mothers’ mental state. Therefore, the current study can be considered as a valuable pilot study that gained more knowledge about families in women’s shelters who are victims of severe domestic violence. These insights implicate that further research, with a larger sample size, is necessary.","['Domestic Violence, Internalizing Behavior Problems', 'Traumatic Youth Experiences', 'PTSD Symptoms.']"

Er is echter nog weinig bekend over welke specifieke ontzagwekkende ervaringen voor meer pro-sociaal gedrag zorgen en of dit verband überhaupt bestaat bij mensen met Dark Triad persoonlijkheidskenmerken. Dit onderzoek doet een voorzet in deze nieuwe richting door zich specifiek te richten op muziek die ontzag opwekt. In dit onderzoek onder Nederlandse universitaire studenten in de leeftijdscategorie van 18 tot 30 jaar werden gevalideerde vragenlijsten ingevuld. Op basis van de verzamelde gegevens zijn verschillende regressieanalyses uitgevoerd en correlaties berekend. De resultaten toonden aan dat er geen significante relatie bestond tussen ontzagwekkende muziek en pro-sociaal gedrag en dat Dark Triad persoonlijkheden geen modererende rol speelden in dit verband. Niettemin wordt aangedrongen op verder onderzoek vanwege de non-experimentele aard van deze studie, wat mogelijk heeft bijgedragen aan de niet-significante bevindingen. Meer kennis over deze psychologische constructen kan invloed hebben op de behandeling van mensen met Dark Triad persoonlijkheidskenmerken en hoe ontzagwekkende muziek gebruikt kan worden om pro-sociaal gedrag te stimuleren.","['Ontzag, ontzagwekkende muziek, pro-sociaal gedrag, Dark Triad persoonlijkheidskenmerken']"

Genderneutraal opvoeden in de kinderopvang: de ontwikkeling van een observatie-instrument,"Jeuken, Lotte",['Marleen Groeneveld'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Tegenwoordig wordt er in media en publieke opinie steeds meer waarde gehecht aan het concept genderneutraal opvoeden. Uit eerder onderzoek blijkt dat niet genderneutraal opvoeden kinderen al op jonge leeftijd in een ‘gender hokje’ plaatst. Op de lange termijn heeft dit gevolgen voor verschillen in beroepskeuzes en inkomsten van mannen en vrouwen. Om dit te voorkomen moet er al vroeg worden gekeken naar genderneutraal opvoeden. Gendersocialisatie begint namelijk al op de kinderopvang. In dit onderzoek is daarom een eerste aanzet van een observatie-instrument voor genderneutraal opvoeden op de kinderopvang ontwikkeld. De onderzoekstudenten hebben dit instrument ontwikkeld gebaseerd op wetenschappelijke literatuur over gender(overtuigingen), uit zowel de gezins-, kinderopvang- als schoolcontext. Het formulier bestaat uit negen categorieën die zijn ondergebracht in zes subschalen, namelijk: activiteiten, gender, interactie, mate van instructie, corrigeren en de ruimte van de kinderdagverblijven. Er zijn in totaal elf observaties gedaan om het observatie-instrument aan te scherpen en de betrouwbaarheid ervan te testen. Uit de analyses over de interbeoordelaarsbetrouwbaarheid bleek dat het observatie-instrument in zijn geheel betrouwbaar was, maar dat nog niet alle subschalen voldoende betrouwbaar geacht konden worden. De beschrijvingen van de observatoren met betrekking tot de ruimte kwamen grotendeels overeen. Er is nog verder onderzoek nodig om ervoor te zorgen dat ook alle subschalen een goede interbeoordelaarsbetrouwbaarheid hebben en het observatie-instrument in de praktijk gebruikt kan worden. Hoewel dit onderzoek een duidelijk startpunt vormt voor een observatie-instrument om genderneutraal opvoedgedrag mee in kaart te kunnen brengen, is vervolgonderzoek aan te raden om het instrument verder te ontwikkelen en bruikbaar te maken voor de praktijk.","['genderneutraal opvoeden', 'observatie-instrument', 'gendersocialisatie']"
Development of Intelligence in Preschool- and School- Aged Children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1,"de Kruijf, Lena","['Henrich, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare neurogenetic disorder. Little longitudinal research has been conducted on the development of intelligence in children with NF1. The purpose of this research was to explore the development of total IQ (TIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), and performance IQ (PIQ) in children with NF1, as well as to determine whether ADHD can affect this development, expecting TIQ, VIQ, and PIQ to decrease over time. Method. To test these hypotheses, intelligence scores (WPPSI-III) were examined in a sample of children with NF1 (N=171) by comparing 2–4-year- olds (T3) and 5–7-year-olds (T6) in both a longitudinal and cross-sectional design. For the longitudinal study, 40 participants were analysed with paired samples t-tests to examine whether TIQ, VIQ, and PIQ decrease over time. To examine how ADHD influenced intelligence, a multivariable regression was conducted. For the cross-sectional study, 45 children participated in T3 and 86 in T6. Multiple independent samples t-tests were conducted to examine changes in TIQ, VIQ, and PIQ, followed by an analysis that examined whether children with ADHD scored differently than children without ADHD. Results. Results of the longitudinal study revealed a significant increase in TIQ from T3 to T6 (p = .015, d = .36), as well as for VIQ (p = .021, d = .34) and PIQ (p = .020, d = .34). However, no significant effect was found for ADHD. Exploring the cross-sectional hypotheses, no significant change was found in TIQ, VIQ, and PIQ. In addition, ADHD also produced no effect on intelligence in these groups. Conclusion. This study has identified an increase of TIQ, VIQ, and PIQ scores in the longitudinal group. In contrast, the results in the cross-sectional study revealed no change in intelligence scores. These findings challenge the assumption that intelligence either decreases or increases meaning for researchers and clinicians to thoroughly evaluate intelligence scores and carry out diagnosis of ADHD so that guidance and education can be tailored, as children with NF1 remain a vulnerable and diverse group.","['neurofibromatosis type 1, intelligence, ADHD']"

The binary logistic regression shows if someone reports a negative mood due to COVID-19 the odds are 2.9 (C.I. = 1.912, 4.446) times more likely to report mental health problems. The conclusion is that mental health problems can have a lot of effect on the development of mood problems during COVID-19. A limitation of the study is that there has not been an investigation why mental problems and a negative mood during COVID-19 are associated. Follow-up research could investigate the effect of social support and resilience on mood.","['corona, students, mood, mental health problems']"

The research design consisted of a combination of the Delphi technique and focus groups, in which the experts' views were first obtained individually through a questionnaire. The input from this questionnaire was then used to guide the focus group discussions. Outcomes included that a basic goal for all students in the classroom can be defined and that differentiation lies more in supporting lower-level students and providing additional challenge to higher level students, perhaps less in adjusting goals. Concrete differentiation strategies were discussed by the experts and are described in the results. Follow-up research can focus on which strategies of support and challenge are most efficient and effective and the effect of setting differentiated goals versus a basic whole-class goal on the learning performance of students in the primary humanities/STEM subjects.","['zaakvakken', 'differentiatie', 'basisonderwijs, instructie', 'doelen', 'verwerking']"
Robustness of the moderating effect of reward processing on externalizing symptoms after childhood trauma,"Gadberry, Olivia","['McCormick, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"One of the many common consequences of experiencing trauma in childhood is a tendency to develop psychopathological symptoms in adolescence and early adulthood. A growing area of psychological research is focusing on uncovering factors that make certain children resilient to the development of these symptoms. According to a study done by Kasparek et al. in 2020, behavioral sensitivity to reward is one such resiliency factor. They found that reward sensitivity moderates the relationship between childhood trauma and developing externalizing symptoms later in life. The present study assessed the robustness of Kasparek et al.’s results via regression analysis and F-tests for equality of variance. This was done using a modified bootstrapping method to remove increasing percentages of participants from random, central, and extreme values of the sample. Despite the significant changes in F-values between the subsamples, the interaction coefficient itself remained relatively stable in the central and extreme conditions, indicating a moderately high probability that the interaction effect does exist in the real world.","['Childhood trauma', 'robustness', 'replicability', 'reward processing']"
From Hierarchy to Homogeneity: The Interplay Between Power Distance and In-Group Bias,"Golo, Sofija","['Farina, A']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In-group bias, the tendency to protect and support one’s group member(s), is an important psychological phenomenon that distorts access to jobs, reduces economic efficiency, and creates social segregation. The existing research on in-group bias and culture has focused on one aspect – individualism versus collectivism. This paper deals with the relationship between in-group bias and power distance, which represents the acceptance of power and influences the interaction between people, groups, organizations, and nations. The present paper will use the economic Dictator Game to investigate the interplay between power distance and in-group bias. The hypothesis that is investigated assumes that higher power distance is positively associated with in-group bias. The results of the experiment, however, report no relationship between in-group bias and power distance. The unexpected result is analyzed in more detail and followed with future suggestions for research within this field. The critical analysis of the extent to which power distance is reliable as a measurement tool in future psychological research remains a useful contribution to an underdeveloped area of research.","['power distance', 'ingroup bias', 'dictator game']"

Met een verdubbeling van gevallen in twee jaar is er een duidelijk zichtbare stijging ontstaan. Deze toename maakt het van belang om de factoren die samenhangen met depressie te onderzoeken. Omdat het gaat over jongeren is het ook van belang goed te kijken naar de rol van de ouders in dit proces. In dit onderzoek wordt er gekeken naar hoe depressieve kinderen het empathische vermogen van hun ouders beleven als zij reageren op verhalen en gebeurtenissen van hun kinderen. Hiervoor onderzochten we 115 kinderen met hun ouders (N=111 moeders en N=94 vaders) en lieten elk kind bij zowel hun vader als hun moeder een vervelende gebeurtenis vertellen. Vervolgens is de manier waarop de ouders een reactie gaven gemeten op drie items, als maat voor de belevenis van empathie bij de kinderen. Een t-toets werd gebruikt om te onderzoeken of dit verschilde bij kinderen met een depressie van een gezonde controlegroep. Uit de resultaten bleek dat kinderen met een depressie hun moeders (maar niet hun vaders) minder empathisch vinden dan kinderen zonder een depressie. Dit betekent dat het hebben van een depressie een voorspeller is voor hoe empathisch moeders over komen. Dit zou kunnen betekenen dat de perceptie van kinderen met een depressie anders is dan gezonde kinderen en zo de empathie van hun ouders als minder worden ervaren. De andere implicaties van deze bevindingen worden in dit onderzoek besproken.",

Eerder onderzoek suggereert dat gedesorganiseerde hechtingstijl een belangrijke invloed zou hebben op de relatie tussen verschillende vormen van mishandeling en dissociatie. Deze studie onderzoekt of er een positief verband bestaat tussen emotionele mishandeling in de kindertijd en dissociatie, die deels gemedieerd wordt door gedesorganiseerde hechtingstijl. Methode: Zelf-gerapporteerde ervaringen met kindermishandeling, gedesorganiseerde hechting en dissociatie werden cross- sectioneel verzameld door middel van een online vragenlijst. Door de PROCESS macro van Hayes (2014) werden de directe, indirecte en totale effecten geanalyseerd. Resultaten: Het gehele model, met zowel het directe effect als het indirecte positieve effect tussen emotionele mishandeling en dissociatie was significant (p < 0.001). Er was dus sprake van partiële mediatie door gedesorganiseerde hechtingsstijl in deze relatie. Discussie: Dit onderzoek bevestigde eerdere bevindingen over emotionele mishandeling en dissociatie. Ook de betekenisvolle rol van gedesorganiseerde hechtingsstijl in deze verhouding werd opnieuw bevestigd. Er konden echter geen vergelijkingen worden gemaakt met andere vormen van mishandeling of hechtingsstijlen. Het sample bevatte daarnaast geen gevarieerde demografie, waardoor de resultaten niet geheel representatief waren voor de gehele populatie.

Master Thesis Joyce van Eijk - final version.pdf,"Eijk, Joyce van","['Berg, J.F. van den + Kok, R.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract BACKGROUND: Frailty is often measured by the Fried criteria, which state that a person is frail when three or more of the following criteria are met: weight loss, exhaustion, diminished physical activity, diminished gait speed and diminished grip strength. Validated screening instruments are the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) and the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI). Within the psychiatric population little is known about the psychometric properties of these screening instruments. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine the internal consistency, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics curve and the underlying dimensionality of the GFI and TFI in older psychiatric patients. METHODS: The present study only uses cross-sectional baseline data. Among 190 patients of 65 years and older the GFI, TFI and Fried criteria were administered. RESULTS: The internal consistencies, measured by the Cronbach’s alpha, of the GFI and TFI were 0.76 and 0.74, respectively. The AUC was 0.80 for the GFI and 0.79 for the TFI. With the best-fitting cut-offs the sensitivity of the GFI was 0.72 and the specificity was 0.71. The positive and negative predictive values were 0.63 and 0.82, respectively. The sensitivity of the TFI was 0.85 and specificity was 0.60. The positive predictive value was 0.70 and the negative predictive value was 0.76. The factor analysis showed that the GFI has a fourdimensional structure and the TFI has a three-dimensional structure. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings show moderate psychometric outcomes of the GFI and TFI among the psychiatric population. However, the outcomes do show clearly that the cut-offs for the psychiatric population should be higher than for the general population.","['frailty', 'GFI', 'TFI', 'reliability', 'predictive value', 'underlying dimensionality']"

Forgetting fear: Using different novel sensory modalities to promote fear extinction and prevent fear reinstatement,"Ceelen, Julia",['Schomaker'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Anxiety, fear, and phobias are our society's most prevalent psychological disorders. Anxiety disorders negatively impact many functional areas that contribute to the overall quality of life and subjective wellbeing, for example, financial stability or a social network. Current therapies of fear extinction rely on extinction by omission of the threat. However, the effect of extinction is only temporary, since the return of fear is common in patients. Previous research has suggested mere omission of the threat is not sufficient, but introducing a novel, non-threatening stimulus during extinction could result in a lack of fear reinstatement in the future. Previous studies have mostly used auditory stimuli as a novelty, though it is unclear if the same effect is present in other sensory modalities. The goal of this study was to investigate if visual and olfactory novelty presented during fear extinction would result in more successful extinction and less fear reinstatement in the post-extinction phase. Fifty-two participants underwent conditioning, in which nine neutral sounds were paired with either fearful images, neutral images, or a black screen as a control condition. After the conditioning phase, the extinction phase commenced in which the nine conditioned sounds were paired with either a novel, familiar, or control stimulus (which is a black screen, so technically no stimulus). The post-extinction tests occurred around 24 hours later, in absence of any visual stimulation. Olfactory novelty was induced by an odor diffuser that was either the same scent in all phases or a new scent in the post-extinction phase. Pupil size was measured on both days as an objective measure of arousal. After every phase, a subjective arousal scale was presented where participants had to indicate their state of arousal when presented with one of the nine conditioned sounds. Statistical analysis was used to determine that conditioning was successful. Using visual novelty in the extinction phase did not result in a smaller pupil size in the novel compared to the familiar condition, suggesting that visual novelty does not promote fear extinction. Furthermore, olfactory novelty promoted fear extinction in the fearful compared to the familiar condition, which suggests olfactory novelty promotes fear extinction in the fearful condition. The results do not suggest visual novelty promotes fear extinction, contrary to the literature. The found results potentially point toward different mechanisms of fear extinction between sensory modalities. More research is needed about the underlying mechanisms of fear and the effect of different novel sensory modalities on fear extinction to create more effective treatments.",
Providing Help to People in Debt: The Effect of Perspective-Taking on Helping Behavior in Different Stages of Debt,"Laan, Annewil van der","['Leeuwen, E.A.C. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This paper investigated whether perspective-taking instructions could successfully increase help providers’ sensitivity to help-seekers’ need for dependency-oriented help in circumstances of problematic debts. The help currently provided in the Netherlands is often not properly aligned with the problems at hand, with an overemphasis on the benefits of autonomy-oriented help (offering the tools to solve a problem independently) and a lack of understanding for the instrumental value and the necessity of dependency-oriented solutions (providing a full solution. In a sample of N = 374, a scenario-based design was employed to test the effect of perspective-taking and different stages of debt (early, intermediate, late) on the preferred help type offered. Findings revealed an overall preference for autonomy- over dependency-oriented help, and a higher willingness to help in later stage conditions. In line with expectations, a preference for autonomy-oriented help was found during earlier stages, and for dependency-oriented help during later stages. Contrary to expectations, those who engaged in perspective-taking were more likely to offer autonomy-oriented help than dependency-oriented help. Nevertheless, in line with our predictions, those who took perspective did anticipate more stress and worse cognitive functioning in the debtor than those who did not. Together, these findings imply an increase in sensitivity for the help- seekers stress severity and cognitive capacities does not necessarily increase the appraisal of dependency-oriented help as a more appropriate solution. These findings have implications for our understanding of helping preferences and the Dutch debt assistance system, urging for a more stress-sensitive bottom-up approach.","['Helping', 'Perspective-Taking', 'Autonomy-Oriented Help', 'Dependency-Oriented Help', 'Debt Assistance', 'Debt']"

De mindful student: De relatie van trait mindfulness met flexibiliteit en angst voor negatieve evaluatie onder studenten.,"Kortleve, Dennis","['Middendorp, H. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Een hogere score op Trait Mindfulness houdt verband met een beter welzijn. Psychologische flexibiliteit houdt ook een verband met een beter welzijn en met minder angst. Echter is niet bekend of een hogere score op Trait Mindfulness ook een hogere score oplevert op psychologische flexibiliteit. Omdat studenten in de COVID- 19 tijd veel geïsoleerd hebben gezeten en veel angst hebben kunnen ontwikkelen, is het belangrijk dat naar een oplossing wordt gezocht om deze angst te verminderen. Het huidige onderzoek is een cross-sectioneel vragenlijstonderzoek en zal niet de oplossing geven, maar wel bijdragen aan de kennis wat tot een oplossing kan leiden. In dit onderzoek werd de relatie tussen Trait Mindfulness met flexibiliteit en angst voor negatieve evaluatie onderzocht. Aan dit onderzoek hebben 161 participanten, studerend aan het HBO of de Universiteit, meegedaan. Hogere scores op Trait Mindfulness hingen samen met hogere scores op flexibiliteit (r = -.76, p < .001), waarvan alle facetten van Trait Mindfulness, behalve ‘observeren’ significante voorspellers waren (F(4,156) = 125.17, p < .001, R2 = 0.762) en lagere scores op angst voor negatieve evaluatie (r = -.44, p < .001), waarvan de Trait Mindfulness- facetten ‘niet-oordelen’ en ‘non-reactief zijn’ significante voorspellers waren (F(2,158) = 36.30, p < .001, R2 = 0.315). Dit onderzoek toont aan dat Trait Mindfulness significant verband houdt met meer psychologische flexibiliteit en minder angst voor negatieve evaluatie. Met vervolgonderzoek kunnen er trainingen worden ontwikkeld om Trait Mindfulness onder studenten te verbeteren en hiermee ook psychologische flexibiliteit te verbeter en hiermee samen angst te verminderen.","['Mindfulness', 'Trait Mindfulness', 'Flexibiliteit', 'Flexibility', 'Negatieve evaluatie', 'negative evaluation']"
Gender and its Relationship to Social Anxiety in Adolescence: Parent Child Attachment as Mediator,"Bholai, Farisha",['S.J.A.J. Jansen'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the most common anxiety disorder among adolescents. In SAD, gender differences are more prominent in adolescence (i.e. a higher prevalence amongst females). As research on gender differences in SAD is scarce, it is still unknown why gender differences in SAD exist and why they are more prominent in adolescents. A factor contributing to the development of SAD is attachment, as it contributes to the way individuals explore a social life. Compared to securely attached adolescents, insecurely attached adolescents experience more difficulty dealing with social situations, placing them at risk for SAD signs. Moreover, an insecure attachment is more common in females than in males. Thus, adolescents' attachment might explain the gender differences in the prevalence of SAD. The current cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between gender and SAD signs, with attachment as a mediator. We also explored whether this differed between maternal and paternal attachment. It was expected that (1) gender would predict SAD signs; (2) attachment would predict SAD signs; and (3) attachment would mediate the relationship between gender and SAD signs (i.e. females would be more insecurely attached and would therefore show more SAD signs than males). In total, 116 adolescents aged 9-12 years completed the YAM-5 and IPPA-R to measure their SAD signs and attachment to their parents, respectively. Regression analyses yielded three main findings. First, contrary to our hypotheses, gender did not significantly predict SAD signs (B = .145; p = .126) and adolescents’ attachment to their parents. Second, consistent with our hypotheses, both maternal (B = -.314; p < .001) and paternal attachment (B = -.393; p < .001) significantly predicted SAD signs. Thus, adolescents’ attachment did not mediate the relationship between gender and SAD signs, but directly affected SAD signs. Attachment-based interventions are effective, but future research is needed to examine if these will also be effective for adolescents with SAD. Additionally, paternal attachment significantly predicted SAD signs. Most previous research, however, has solely focused on maternal attachment. This study, therefore, highlights the importance of more father representation in future research regarding attachment.","['social anxiety disorder', 'early adolescence', 'attachment', 'gender', 'IPPA-R', 'YAM-5']"

Distorting Fear: Novelty-Facilitated Fear Extinction and The Effect of Perceived Stress,"Lahidheb, Nourhene",['Judith Schomaker'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental health problems affecting nearly 30 % of adults at some point in their life. Anxiety has detrimental consequences on one's wellbeing. While contemporary treatments have proven effective, relapse rates are very high. In fact, anxiety rates have remained the same in previous years, which highlights the pressing need to develop new treatments that are more effective and durable. Recent studies suggested a positive role of novelty in fear extinction and potential application of this in the clinical field of anxiety and related disorders. It has also been suggested that individual traits and differences in internal states have consequences on fear extinction. Perceived stress (PSS), which is the individual's appraisal of a particular situation as stressful, is highly correlated with anxiety disorders; however, no previous studies investigated the effect of PSS on novelty-facilitated fear extinction. The current study included a total of 60 participants and employed a fear conditioning paradigm with fearful, neutral, and control stimuli. Fear extinction was achieved by repeatedly presenting the conditioned stimuli alone (i.e., standard extinction) or by using replacement stimuli (i.e., novel or familiar). We assessed the role of novelty in fear extinction by comparing pupil sizes in response to the conditioned stimuli. We hypothesized that novelty would yield greater fear extinction as compared to standard extinction and extinction using familiarity. We also hypothesized that the effect of novelty on fear extinction would be durable. In line with previous studies, fear extinction using novelty was more pronounced than standard extinction and extinction using familiarity as assessed by smaller pupil size. In contrast to our expectations, no significant impact of novelty was found in a post-extinction phase (approx. one day after extinction). This study further investigated the role of perceived stress in novelty-facilitated fear extinction. We hypothesized a negative correlation between perceived stress (PSS) and novelty-facilitated fear extinction. Correlation analysis did not reveal any relationship between PSS and novelty-facilitated fear extinction. Future studies should aim to deepen our understanding of the mechanism underlying fear extinction by exploring other mental states and individual differences that might mediate the role of novelty in fear extinction.","['Fear, Extinction, Novelty, Conditioning, Familiarity, Perceived Stress']"

Auditief werkgeheugen en cognitieve flexibiliteit: Een verklaring voor verschillen in kenmerken van de autismespectrumstoornis bij jongens en meisjes?,"Meijerink, Linde","['Bergwerff, C.E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Well-developed executive functions (EF) are important for a proper development of children. Verbal working memory and cognitive flexibility are used on daily basis in social situations, by processing complex cognitive information and in understanding language. Children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have deficits in these EF, which could explain the symptoms of their ASD, such as restricted and repetitive behaviors and difficulties in social interaction and communication. Girls show their ASD symptoms differently than boys, which could partly mean that their EF work differently. This cross-sectional study researched the relationship between verbal working memory and cognitive flexibility on the one hand and ASD symptoms on the other hand. Furthermore, it has been researched whether EF mediate the relationship between gender and ASD symptoms. In this study 38 children and adolescents, 20 boys and 18 girls, between 6 and 16 years took part. The sample contained 6 children with a DSM classification of ASD. To measure the cognitive flexibility, verbal working memory and ASD symptoms, the following instruments were used respectively: Trail Making Test, Digit Span Test and the Social Responsiveness Scale. None of the results were significant, which indicates that in this study verbal working memory and cognitive flexibility had no relationship with ASD symptoms. In addition, the mediations were also non-significant, which suggests that in this study boys and girls show comparable ASD symptoms as well as similar skills in verbal working memory and cognitive flexibility. Practically that would mean that the support boys and girls need for their EF deficits and ASD, should be similar as well. However, the results should be considered with the limitations of this study. This study contributes to the first steps into understanding and supporting girls with ASD better.","['executive functions', 'verbal working memory', 'cognitive flexibility', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'ASD', 'gender difference', 'sex difference']"

KiBA App Development and Usability: Facilitating Home Practice After Exposure in Children with Specific Phobias,"Rahemenia, Jasmin","['Klein, A. M.', 'Hagen, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Objective: Childhood anxiety disorders are a widespread concern that may impede children’s development. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) with exposure is considered an effective treatment for childhood anxiety. After treatment, home practice helps children to develop skills that they learned during CBT. However, home practice is often challenging for children. Mobile health (mHealth) apps have the potential to facilitate home practice. We aimed to describe the development of the KiBA (Kids Beat Anxiety) app and test its usability. Method: In Study 1 (development phase), we included therapists (n = 5) and children (n = 8, aged 7- 14) to review app mock-ups during five meetings. IT-specialists incorporated the feedback multiple times. Next, two beta-tester groups tested the app and rated its usability. The first group tested the app for one hour at school (n = 14, mean age = 9.50), and the second group tested the app for one week at home (n = 8, mean age = 10.55). In Study 2 (clinical sample), children with a specific phobia (n = 8, Mage = 12.10) used the app for four weeks at home following CBT, and children and parents rated its usability. Results: Feedback led to multiple improvements (e.g., game elements, layout, colors, instructions). Usability ratings were both high in the beta-tester groups in the development phase (8.4/10 and 8.1/10) and the clinical sample (8.6/10 children and 8.1/10 parents). Children indicated they found the app easy, fun, and user-friendly. Conclusions: This study underlines the value of including end-users in the development of mHealth apps. The KiBA app (1) offers tools for children and their parents to practice exposure at home, and (2) helps therapists to monitor children’s progress.","['mHealth, exposure, home practice, specific phobia, children']"
The association between serum-level nutritional status and aggressive behavior in psychiatric inpatients,"Jamaloodin, Maxime","['Gast, D.A.A']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Malnourishment and aggression are highly prevalent in psychic inpatients and is detrimental to both patients and staff. Recent research suggests a relationship between nutrition and aggression. Aim: to examine the relationship between serum-level vitamin D, B1, B6, B9, B12, DHA, EPA, and magnesium and aggressive behaviors in long-stay psychiatric inpatients. Method: Serum-level micronutrients were assessed through blood sampling and aggressive tendencies via the Dutch version of the Social Dysfunction and Aggression Questionnaire (SDAS) and Dutch version of the shortened Aggression Questionnaire (AVL-AV) measures at baseline and 6-month follow up (T1). Two multiple linear regression models, controlling for age and gender, were calculated utilzing aggression measures as the dependent variable. Pairwise comparisons were calculated between all variables to assess differences between measurements at baseline and T1, and those who showed significant differences were utilized to calculate change scores and compute another multiple linear regression to assess change score association. Results: Data from 99 participants were analyzed. Serum-level micronutrients together only explained AVL-AV scores and not SDAS, after controlling for age and gender, R2 change = 17.7, F change (9,78) = 1.97, p = .05) . Vitamin B1 was a signficant predictor of AVL-AV ( = - 0.40, t(78) = -3.27, p < .05) and gender was a significant predictor of SDAS ( = .43, t(76) = 3.65, p < .001). The model including change scores of B9, B12, B6, EPA, DHA and SDAS was non-significant and only changes on B9 significantly predicted changes in SDAS scores, = -.58, t(31) = -2.59, p < .05 . Conclusions: micronutrients can explain, to a certain extent, variation in self-reported aggression tendencies.",

Cognitieve empathie en emotieherkenning bij kinderen met externaliserend probleemgedrag,"Roon, Anoek van","['Jong, R. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Externalizing behavior in childhood is considered an important predictor for behavioral disorders and antisocial behavior in adolescence and early adulthood. Knowledge of which factors are related to the presence of externalizing behavior could help create effective interventions for reducing externalizing behavior. Previous research indicated that there is a negative relation between emotion recognition, empathy with externalizing behavior, but the results are inconsistent. The present study aimed to examine whether externalizing behavior could be predicted by emotion recognition and empathy within a sample of children showing externalizing behavior (n = 130). Externalizing behavior was measured with the TRF, nonverbal emotion recognition with the FER, verbal emotion recognition with the ANT prosody task, and cognitive empathy with questions about different emotional video clips. Results showed that non-verbal and verbal recognition of emotions did not correlate significantly with externalizing behavior, except when there was less non-verbal emotion recognition of happy feelings there was slightly more externalizing behavior. Externalizing behavior was not predicted by verbal-, and non-verbal emotion recognition, and cognitive empathy. There also was no partial mediation from verbal- and non-verbal emotion recognition on the relationship between cognitive empathy and externalizing behavior. It seems that children that show less cognitive empathy and correct verbal and non-verbal emotion recognition do not show more externalizing behavior. It is possible that this is different for certain emotions, because children who were slightly better at recognizing the non-verbal emotion happy showed slightly less externalizing behavior. Future research should include the possible effect of age on the relationship between emotion recognition and cognitive empathy with externalizing behavior and the possible difference of externalizing behavior reported by teachers and parents should be taken into account.","['externalizing behavior', 'emotion recognition', 'empathy', 'cognitive empathy', 'affective empathy']"
Influence of Preconception Counselling on Perspectives and Psychosocial Wellbeing of Women Conceiving through Oocyte Donation,"Visser, Amber","['van Laarhoven, A.I.M']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"For women with a diminished oocyte reserve, for example due to premature ovarian insufficiency, oocyte donation (OD) is their only possibility to conceive. However, OD is related to a higher incidence of pregnancy complications and psychosocial challenges. Preconception counselling (PC) helps women who might opt for OD by explaining the risks of a pregnancy, guiding them in their decision making and focussing on the psychosocial wellbeing. This thesis aims to explore the perspectives on PC of women who conceived through OD. Furthermore, using a quantitative questionnaire design, this thesis aims to investigate the differences on psychosocial constructs (quality of life (QoL), contentment, anxiety, and distress) between women who did and did not receive PC. The perspectives of these women were investigated by conducting qualitative focus-group research. To summarize the perspectives of these women, analyses of the focus groups were done by both deductive and inductive coding. The questionnaire was based upon the validated FertiQoL questionnaire (measures QoL in people with fertility problems) and the GAD-7 questionnaire (measures anxiety and distress). Analyses of the quantitative outcomes were done with an independent samples t-test or a Mann-Whitney U test. The sample included 87 women who did receive PC, and 24 women who did not receive PC before their OD treatment. Analyses of the focus groups indicated the need for more clarity on the process of OD (e.g., finding a donor, possible risks), possibly by the development of a guideline. Also, the participating women would have liked to receive more psychosocial support. Analyses of the questionnaire showed no significant differences between both groups on the psychosocial variables, except for one scale on contentment, U(NPC=no=21, NPC=yes= 80) = 599.50, z = -2.02, p = .043. Women who did receive PC were more content with the quality and availability of treatment. In conclusion, this research could be implemented into a national guideline, offering a helpful document on OD care for health care providers, and thereby improving OD care for these women and their partners.","['Preconception counselling', 'oocyte donation pregnancy', 'quality of life', 'anxiety', 'distress', 'contentment']"
The transmission of stranger anxiety from parents to children: The effect of parental verbal expressions and child temperament on child avoidance behavior in social situations,"Postma, Willemke",['Aktar E.'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social anxiety disorder aggregates in families. Parents may environmentally transmit anxiety to the offspring by two pathways of social learning; modeling, or the transmission of information. This study investigated the effect of parents’ verbal transfer of threat/anxiety vs. safety information about strangers on children’s observed avoidance of strangers. Additionally, the potential moderating role of child temperament in this effect was explored. Parents gave threat/anxiety vs. safety information to their 10-to-13- year old child about a stranger (N=72). Thereafter, the child had to do social tasks. Child avoidance of strangers was measured from the social performance and watching back tasks, and coded with an adapted protocol. Child temperament was measured with questionnaires, filled in by both parent and child. The verbal information from the parent paired with the strangers did not significantly differ in the child’s avoidance behavior between the safety condition and the threat condition during the social tasks. Also, the verbal information from the parents did not differentially influence the responses of children to strangers linked to threat and safety messages, based on their BI level. We conclude that parents’ verbal transfer of threat/anxiety vs. safety information about strangers did not have an effect on children’s observed avoidance of strangers in this experiment. This study gave insight into causal processes of fear acquisition in typical developments and can inform future studies that investigate this interesting subject about the design of the study and experiment.","['parental verbal learning, children’s observed avoidance, child temperament, social anxiety.']"

The relationship between the severity of itch symptoms and attentional bias in patients with chronic itch,"Hassink, Janne",['Jennifer Becker'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Itch is an evolutionary mechanism that protects one from harm. It is an unpleasant sensation that often leads to scratching or rubbing. Some skin conditions have itching as a primary symptom. Moreover, it is an experience that is likely to draw attention. Therefore, attentional bias might be found in patients with a chronic itch condition. However, it has not been investigated whether experiencing a higher level of itch symptoms leads to a higher attentional bias towards itch. The aim of this research is to investigate whether patients with a chronic itch condition that experience more itch symptoms (at the current moment of testing) will have a higher attentional bias score as opposed to people with fewer itch symptoms. The subjects of this study were 5 patients with a chronic itch condition (atopic dermatitis and/or psoriasis). In order to answer the research question participants filled in questionnaires and an attention bias task (dot-probe task with itch-related pictures) was performed. To establish the level of itch symptoms participants filled in a scale from 0 to 10. The result did not indicate higher attentional bias in patients with higher itch symptoms. The results did not support the expectation that a higher level of itch symptoms leads to a higher attentional bias towards itch. However, this might be due to the low number of participants. Future research should take coping style into account.","['Attentional Bias', 'Psoriasis', 'eczema']"

This vulnerability was indicated by a score of ≥ 65 on the Teacher Report Form. The results of this study contribute to research regarding preventive interventions to reduce the occurrence of criminal activities among youth in larger cities in the Netherlands, like Amsterdam. The IQ was measured with the Dutch version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale III. Externalizing behavior problems were measured through the Teacher Report Form. Cognitive empathy was measured by a questionnaire regarding the four elements of empathy in four different stimulus clips that were shown. In the current study no significant relationship was found between IQ and externalizing behavior problems or between cognitive empathy and externalizing behavior problems. Only a positive relationship between IQ and cognitive empathy was found, indicating that children with a higher IQ experienced more cognitive empathy. The results off this study cannot confirm the role of cognitive empathy as a possible mediator in the relationship between IQ and externalizing behavior problems. Because of the significant relationship found between IQ and cognitive empathy, it’s important that these variables are examined together and not individually in future research. The results of this study contribute to the development of new interventions regarding the risk factors of externalizing behavior problems in children who have a high risk of criminal behavior later in life.

Furthermore, it is investigated if changes in mental wellbeing between two timepoints during the pandemic are related to changes in somatoform symptoms during COVID-19 in adolescents who experienced childhood adversity. Also, exploratory analyses were run to investigate whether mental wellbeing at the first time point could predict changes in somatoform symptoms over time and vice versa. Longitudinal measures from seventy-six adolescents are used across two timepoints: during the first peak in the pandemic (April 2020) and when the restrictions were less stringent (July 2020). The results show that there is an association between the experienced somatoform symptoms and mental wellbeing. This association is also found between the change in mental wellbeing over time and the change in somatoform symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also clear that both mental wellbeing and somatoform symptoms during the first peak of the SARS-CoV-2-virus have no predictive value for the change in mental wellbeing or somatoform symptoms over time. This research contributes to the existing body of literature with the discovery that mental wellbeing and somatoform symptoms are associated during COVID-19 in adolescents who experienced childhood adversity. Although the association is clear in this research, it is recommended to extend the research design by including multiple, possibly contributing factors, such as loneliness, stress, gender, type, severity and duration of the experienced childhood adversity, to investigate the underlying mechanism. Secondly, it is recommended to investigate the effectiveness of interventions which adequately support adolescents who experienced childhood adversity and experience somatoform symptoms, for example the ‘Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy’-intervention.","['Somatoforme klachten', 'mentaal welzijn', 'jeugdtrauma', 'covid-19']"

How Are Sleep Quality and Cognitive Functioning Related to Glycemic Parameters in People with Type 1 Diabetes,"Everwien, Sabeth","['Wit, M. de', 'Laarhoven, A.I.M. van', 'Veldhuijzen, D.S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often experience problems with their glucose regulation (glucose variability and glucose control), sleep quality, and cognitive functioning. However, their interrelation has not often been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate how sleep quality and cognitive functioning are associated with glucose regulation in people with T1D. Method: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data was collected over two weeks, in 18 participants, while each day subjective sleep quality (once in the morning) and cognitive functioning (e.g., ability to concentrate, finding words) (up to five times during the day) was measured using ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). Based on the CGM data, glycemic parameters (glucose variability and glucose control) during the night and day were calculated and a mean value of cognitive functioning per day was composed. Linear mixed model analyses were used to test for 1) whether sleep quality was influenced by glycemic parameters during the night and 2) whether cognitive functioning during the day was influenced by sleep quality and whether cognitive functioning was associated with glycemic parameters during the day. In addition, an interaction effect between sleep quality and glucose variability on cognitive functioning was explored. Lastly, visual plots were used to explore the associations on an individual level. Results: No statistically significant main effects were found for either association. However, an interaction trend (ß = -2.07, p = .070) between sleep quality and glucose variability on cognitive functioning scores was found. For days with normal fluctuations in glucose levels, better sleep quality was associated with better cognitive functioning, whereas for days with high glucose variability, this association could not be found. Regarding the individual plots, both, positive and negative relationships between all mentioned variables were apparent, exemplifying important inter-individual differences. Conclusion: For people with T1D, the relationships between glucose parameters, sleep quality, and cognitive functioning, vary from person to person. This finding advocates for looking at the individual level when implementing possible treatment methods for increasing sleep quality and cognitive functioning. More research in a larger sample is warranted to further examine the inter-individual factors in these associations.","['type 1 diabetes', 'glucose variability', 'glucose control', 'sleep quality', 'cognitive functioning']"
Begeleiding van het sociaal-emotioneel functioneren van leerlingen in de overgang van primair naar voortgezet onderwijs,"Wekken, Boukje van der","['Leijenhorst, L. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De PO-VO overgang is een uitdagende periode voor leerlingen die gepaard gaat met het begin van de adolescentie. Het sociaal-emotioneel functioneren wordt op de proef gesteld. Goede begeleiding is nodig om te zorgen dat leerlingen goed ontwikkelen en een succesvolle overgang kunnen doormaken. De onderzoeksvraag luidt: Wat zijn de kenmerken van effectieve begeleiding door leerkrachten van het sociaal-emotioneel functioneren van leerlingen in de overgang van het primair onderwijs naar het voortgezet onderwijs? Een kwalitatief onderzoek is gehouden met semigestructureerde interviews voor groep 8 leerkrachten en brugklasmentoren. De interviewvragen zijn vastgesteld op basis van de resultaten uit de literatuur. De interviews zijn gecodeerd en geanalyseerd met Atlas.ti. Aan de hand van drie effectieve kenmerken van begeleiding die uit het literatuuronderzoek naar voren zijn gekomen zijn de resultaten geanalyseerd. De drie kenmerken zijn dat de leerkracht sociale relaties tussen leerlingen stimuleert; dat de leerkracht individuele leerlingbegeleiding biedt; en dat de leerkracht leerlingen voorbereidt op een mogelijke dip in schoolresultaten. Deze kenmerken kwamen in de analyse ook naar voren. Uit dit onderzoek is gebleken dat de effectieve kenmerken van begeleiding van het sociaal-emotioneel functioneren zijn dat leerkrachten sociale relaties stimuleren en begeleiden, dat leerkrachten leerlingen individueel begeleiden in de overgang en dat leerlingen gerustgesteld worden als hun resultaten tegenvallen aan het begin van het VO. Er was een beperkt aantal participanten, deze groep was niet geheel representatief voor de populatie. In vervolgonderzoek zou gekeken kunnen worden naar welke specifieke manieren van het stimuleren van sociale relaties effectief zijn.",

Suitability of Autism Diagnostic Instruments in Angelman Syndrome: Comparing Parent Report to Clinical Assessment,"Wageningen, Charlotte van","['Houdt, C. van', 'Hagenaar, D.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Angelman syndrome (AS) is partially characterized by a severe intellectual disability and absence of speech, which have been indicated as limiting factors in the applicability of standard diagnostic instruments for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), such as the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, second edition (ADOS-2). The current study examines the applicability of the ADOS-2 and SRS in a pediatric AS population and investigates the effect of instrument type (parent report [SRS] versus clinical assessment [ADOS-2]) on ASD- classification. ASD incidence was hypothesized to be lower based on parent report than on clinical assessment. Methods: SRS and ADOS-2 assessments and DSM diagnoses of 57 AS patients (mean age = 8.5 years) were collected retrospectively at the ENCORE Angelman expertise center (Erasmus MC). Sample prevalence of ASD based on the DSM, SRS and ADOS-2 was determined. DSM diagnosis was considered as the ‘true diagnosis’. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of the ADOS-2 and SRS were calculated. A Generalized Linear Mixed Model was used to analyze the differences in ASD-classification based on instrument type, with gender, age, epilepsy, and genotype as covariates. An exploratory paired t-test was used to examine subscale differences. Results: ASD prevalence in the current sample (10.5%) was higher than in the general population (1%) but lower than previously suggested (34-81%). Both the SRS and ADOS-2 had perfect sensitivity, but poor specificity (SRS = 5.88%, ADOS-2 = 37.25%). A significant difference between parent report and clinical assessment was found (p < .001), with parent report resulting in more ASD-classifications. Exploratory analysis revealed differing scores on both the social and repetitive behavior subscales of the instruments (p < .001). Genotype affected ASD-classification (p < .006). Conclusion: Standard diagnostic instruments for ASD were found to be unsuitable for use in the AS population, especially the SRS. The ADOS-2 provided a slightly more accurate representation of the child’s functioning. Use of the ADOS-2 and SRS should be carefully considered, and scores and classifications should be interpreted with extreme caution. Meanwhile, future research should focus on the development of suitable alternatives to current standard instruments.",

"Examining Links Between Individual Depressive Symptoms, Indicators of Socioeconomic Status, and Stressors","Platania, Noemi","['Fried, Eiko']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Individuals with a lower socioeconomic status (SES) are at an increased risk for developing depressive symptoms. However, it has not been investigated whether this link is homogenous, or whether specific depressive symptoms relate to SES differentially. In this thesis, I explored (1) which individual symptoms of depression are related to subjective social status (as a proxy for SES); (2) how specific indicators of SES are related to specific symptoms of depression; and (3) how the addition of stressors impacts the relations between SES indicators and depressive symptoms. I used data previously gathered from 448 students aged ≥18 at institutions of higher education in the Netherlands, as a part of the WARN-D study. Variables were assessed through a questionnaire that was administered online. I estimated three regularised partial correlation networks to explore shared variances among nine symptoms of depression, five indicators of SES, and seven stressors. The network analyses revealed that (1) subjective social status (as a proxy for SES) was negatively associated with guilt/worthlessness, depressed mood, anhedonia, trouble concentrating, and feeling tired, meaning that participants with higher scores on subjective social status had, on average, lower scores on these symptoms; (2) educational level (as one of multiple indicators of SES) was negatively associated with appetite disturbances, and the ability to get by financially was negatively associated with depressed mood, guilt/worthlessness, and appetite disturbances; (3) these associations diminished considerably or disappeared altogether when controlling for the stressor variables. Overall, all SES-depression associations were small in magnitude. The results suggest that patterns of depressive symptoms might differ between high-SES and low-SES individuals. Future research should explore the mechanisms behind these differences to guide prevention and intervention. My findings are consistent with previous research showing that symptom composite scores obscure important differences between individuals.","['depression', 'socioeconomic status', 'individual depressive symptoms', 'network analysis']"

Prosocial giving behaviour and self-concept in non-gifted and gifted adolescents,"van den Berge, Lisa","['Zanolie, C.K.K.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Early adolescence, between the age of 10 to 13, is characterized by gaining more autonomy and an increase in complex social relationships. To engage in these social relations, prosocial giving behaviour and self-concept play an important role. Within gifted adolescents the social development is different from non-gifted adolescents, which might affect the development of prosocial giving behaviour and self-concept. In the current research we were interested in prosocial giving behaviour towards different targets and academic/non-academic self-concept within and between non-gifted and gifted adolescents. We recruited 112 children in the 7th and 8th grade from schools with regular and full-time gifted education. The Standard Progressive Raven Matrices was used to assess IQ, the Prosocial Giving Task to measure giving behaviour towards different targets and the Competentiebelevingsschaal voor Kinderen to measure self-concept on six areas. The results showed that adolescents gave more to in-group targets than to out-group targets. We also found that within non-gifted adolescents the academic self-concept was lower than the non-academic self-concept. Within gifted adolescents, there was no difference between the academic and non-academic self-concept. For both prosocial giving behaviour and self-concept, we did not find a difference between non-gifted and gifted adolescents. Furthermore, there was not an association between prosocial giving behaviour and self-concept for both non-gifted and gifted adolescents. Future research could consider to take the transition to high school into account. This transition might influence the development of both prosocial giving behaviour and self-concept during early adolescence within both non-gifted and gifted adolescents.","['prosocial giving behaviour', 'self-concept', 'early adolescence', 'gifted', 'non-gifted']"

Prior research has demonstrated Parkinson’s disease-related impairments in both of these functions. However, their relationship has not yet been investigated. This study aims to compare the relationship between error-monitoring and goal-directed behaviour in healthy adults versus those with Parkinson's disease (PD). The sample included 30 healthy participants (Mage=65.7; 19 female, 11 male) and 6 participants with PD (Mage=61; 1 female, 5 male). Goal-directed behaviour was assessed using the Tower Test, and error-monitoring was measured using a modified version of the Attentional Network Task. MANOVA was conducted to examine whether the healthy control group and PD group differed significantly from each other in their average outcomes on error-monitoring and goal-directed behaviour. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine if there was a difference in the relationship between healthy adults and people with PD. To account for assumption violations and the small sample size, we additionally used Bayesian and non-parametrical approaches. higher compared to individuals with PD on the Attentional Network Task. (H(1)=4.222, p=.040, g=.843), but no significant differences were found in the performances on the Tower Test. The results showed no significant difference between the relationship in error-monitoring and goal-directed behaviour between healthy adults and people with PD. Additionally, the present data provide moderate evidence that the performance on error-monitoring and goal-directed behaviour did not differ between people with PD and healthy adults (R2=.058, BF01=5.422). Overall, the findings suggest that there is no difference in the relationship between error-monitoring and goal-directed behaviour in individuals with PD compared to healthy controls. Additionally, the results suggest that error-monitoring, but not goal-directed behaviour, in individuals with PD is impaired. Our findings imply that future interventions should focus on improving executive functioning, particularly error-monitoring, in individuals with PD.","['Error-monitoring', 'goal-directed behaviour', ""Parkinson's disease""]"

Kivelä'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Suicide rates are steadily growing, while the Netherlands fails to gain control of this growth. One of the key factors of suicide is suicide ideation, therefore preventing suicide ideation is crucial. Previous research suggests that burdensomeness and hopelessness predict next-day suicide ideation and are negatively associated with sleep duration and efficiency. In turn, sleep duration and efficiency increase next-day suicide ideation. Research regarding these topics mainly has relied on subjective sleep reports which can be influenced by different kinds of biases. Objectively examining predictors of suicide ideation is fairly new. Therefore, this study examined sleep objectively. We investigated the possible mediating effect of sleep duration and efficiency on the relationship between hopelessness, burdensomeness, and next-day suicide ideation in a sample of 40 individuals with a history of suicide (ideation). Data gathering happened through the use of an actiwatch for sleep duration and efficiency. An EMA-style approach was used for burdensomeness, hopelessness, and suicide ideation over three weeks. In line with previous research, we found that increased burdensomeness and hopelessness are significant predictors of increased next-day suicide ideation. Moreover, increased burdensomeness and hopelessness are negatively associated with sleep efficiency. This finding, burdensomeness associated with sleep efficiency, is one of the first reported within this field. In turn, sleep duration and efficiency are not significantly associated with next-day suicide ideation, even though previous research suggests otherwise. These contradictions indicate that more research should be done with objective measures, while subjective research shows different results.",

Exploring the Relationship Between Grip Strength and Cognitive Functioning: A Study in Healthy Individuals,"Gort, Fleur","['Aarts, J, MSc', 'Prof. Dr. Hulst, H.E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background Physical activity has been shown to be important in relation to cognitive functioning, mental health, and happiness. Cognitive functioning consists of several subdomains like information processing speed and episodic memory. Physical activity can be distinguished from physical exercise and fitness. A relatively easy way to assess physical activity is by using grip strength as measurable parameter. Aims The current study researches the relationship between grip strength and cognitive functioning. Furthermore, it assesses the relationship between age and cognitive functioning and the difference in grip strength among sexes. Methods The Multiple Screener is used to assess cognitive functioning. This tool consists of the online versions of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), the Dutch version of the California Verbal Learning Test – second edition (CVLT-II) and the Spatial Recall Test (SPART). Grip strength is measured by using a handheld hydraulic dynamometer. The sample consists of 29 healthy individuals aged between 19 and 59 years old. Results A borderline significant negative relationship was found between grip strength and cognitive functioning (p = .066). In addition, a significant inverse relationship between age and cognitive functioning was observed (p = .016). A significant difference in sex was found for grip strength (p = .002), with men having greater grip strength than women. Discussion The borderline significant negative relationship between grip strength and cognitive functioning could be a consequence of the sample used in the current study. The relationship between grip strength and cognitive functioning has been found to be positive in an elderly population researched in previous studies. The significant difference in grip strength between men and women could potentially play a role in the negative relationship found in the primary hypothesis. Interventions aimed at improving grip strength could possibly function as a resiliency factor or could be used to detect early cognitive decline in later age, but not yet in younger adults.","['Cognitive functioning', 'grip strength', 'multiple screener', 'healthy']"

This research explores this phenomenon by comparing two Palestinian rights advocacy groups in the Netherlands and explaining their claim-making strategies through the framework of political context which is measured in terms of institutional access, alliance structure, and conflict structure. This case is chosen as it examines a contested issue within a political environment that has historically proven to be hostile towards it. This study argues that the political context of a group plays a key role in determining whether they employ an inside- oriented or outside-oriented claim-making strategy. Through a qualitative comparative analysis, this research has demonstrated that, with consideration to other possible explanations, differing political contexts lead to divergent claim-making strategies for advocacy groups despite their similar characteristics. Additionally, while the political context shapes the claim-making strategy, this does not diminish group agency.","['Advocacy, contested issues, Israel-Palestine, mobilization, claim-making, political opportunity structure, the Netherlands.']"

"Can nudges promote individual autonomy? Yes, but not unconditionally","Labeur, Robert Jesse","['Belic, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,The current debate on nudging is dichotomous since it either mentions the arguments in favor of or opposed to nudging. Proponents of nudging also assume that nudges should pursue the goal to produce certain desired outcomes. This paper questions the current dichotomy of the debate and the assumption on the goal of nudges by differentiating between an output-oriented and a process-oriented conception of nudging. The aim of the thesis is to argue that process-oriented nudges rather than output-oriented nudges are desirable because they can promote the autonomy-based freedom of individuals. The thesis formulates three conditions that process-oriented nudges should satisfy in order to promote autonomy-based freedom and it applies the process-oriented conception of nudging to three different nudges. The paper concludes that especially the nudges that make relevant information salient and that change defaults are compatible with a process-oriented conception of nudging. The process-oriented conception of nudging was applied to the empirical case of vaccination policies in order to find out what kind of nudges would be compatible with a process-oriented conception of nudging.,"['nudging', 'autonomy', 'libertarian paternalism', 'output-oriented', 'process-oriented']"

A Social Connection Model of Individual Responsibility to Face Climate Injustice,"Eizaguirre, Esther","['Belic, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In a context of insufficient climate action on the part of governments, the question of whether individuals have any underlying moral responsibility concerning climate change has become increasingly relevant. However, despite various theoretical attempts to ground such responsibility, none of them has been completely satisfactory, resulting in a lack of consensus in the scholarly literature. In this thesis, I engage with this debate, guided by the following research question: what is the nature of individual responsibility for climate change? I build on Iris Marion Young’s Social Connection Model (SCM) of responsibility to respond to this question. I argue that using Young’s SCM to conceptualize individual responsibility to face climate injustice is appropriate because it captures the structural nature of the problem. The shared and forward-looking responsibility it entails and its focus on collective political action provide a framework to respond to climate injustice meaningfully. However, while Young sees the nature of such responsibility as being strictly political, I engage critically with the author and argue that, instead, the responsibility we bear to face climate injustice is moral. Despite concerns about moral responsibility and the blameworthiness it entails, I explore how blame can be a mechanism of accountability and social enforceability, fundamental for ensuring effective collective climate action.","['Climate injustice', 'individual responsibility', 'Iris Marion Young']"

Gender Differences in Intergroup Empathy Bias: A Gender-based Exploration of Intergroup Understanding,"Fırat, Damla","['Fariña, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Ingroup bias is the inclination of people to favor members of their group compared to those of an outgroup. One possible underlying mechanism behind ingroup bias is individual differences in empathy levels. Individuals high in empathy are usually more prosocial towards others. Yet, they may still act more prosocially towards members of their own group than outgroup members, leading to a specific type of ingroup bias, termed intergroup empathy bias. It is a well-established fact that gender differences exist in how individuals show empathy. This study aimed to find whether there may also be gender differences in intergroup empathy bias. This question was investigated in a university population using the dot game to divide people into minimal groups, and the dictator game to compare ingroup and outgroup giving. The results demonstrated that ingroup bias can occur in the presence of minimal groups, and females have higher empathy levels compared to males. However, these results did not translate to gender differences in intergroup empathy bias. Despite not finding a link between intergroup empathy bias and gender, this research proposes novel ideas for further testing, such as using empathy questionnaires that distinguish between different facets of empathy. It attracts attention to the importance of gender differences in empathy, especially in today’s male-centered society.","['ingroup bias', 'intergroup empathy bias', 'dictator game', 'minimal group paradigm', 'empathy', 'gender differences']"

Does Sociosexual Orientation Mediate the Relationship Between Attachment Style and Sexual Overperception Bias in Men?,"Schirach, Leonie von",['Iliana Samara'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"A well-known phenomenon in our society is that men tend to overperceive sexual attraction from women, which is called the sexual overperception bias. There has been an increasing focus in research to investigate the mechanisms of this bias and to identify the individual differences in men that could contribute to this misperception. Prior research suggests that sexual overperception bias is related to attachment style, with anxious men showing higher overperception, and avoidant men showing less overperception. It has also been suggested that men’s sociosexual orientation contributes to the amount of misperception. Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether men’s sociosexual orientation mediates the relationship between attachment style and sexual overperception bias. Thirteen (n = 13) male participants watched brief video clips of actors of the opposite sex, thinking they were having a webcam interaction with them. The participants were asked to rate their attraction towards and the perceived attractiveness from the actors. Furthermore, they completed questionnaires which were used to predict attachment style and sociosexual orientation. Contrary to the hypothesis, the results showed that sociosexual orientation did not significantly mediate the relationship between attachment style and sexual overperception bias. This might have partly been caused by a small sample size. The findings and limitations were discussed and implications for future research suggested.","['Sexual overperception bias', 'attachment style', 'sociosexual orientation', 'sexual attraction']"

Research examining civilian cooperation and non-cooperation within conflict studies has largely overlooked the micro-level dynamics of civilian resistance in inter-state war. Addressing this gap, this study uses testimonial data on the lived experiences of Russian civilians who refused cooperation with the Russian state following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The paper develops an argument that manifestations of civilian non-cooperation are shaped by individual and collectivised security seeking behaviour within repressive governance structures. It integrates theories of civilian agency and authoritarian repression. Lived experiences of violent repression both construct the image of the state as a violent institution and inform the efficacy of tactics of resistance, resulting in variation between avoidance, overt-resistance and oblique-resistance behaviours. As an exploratory study, the paper identifies gaps in our understanding and avenues for future research on civilian cooperation and non-cooperation in inter-state armed conflict.","['Armed Conflict, State Repression, Civilian Agency']"

Striving for your Own Good: The Impact of Effort in Anticommons Dilemmas,"Bochmann, Leonard",['Erik de Kwaadsteniet'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present study investigates how the exertion of effort will impact behavior in an anticommons resource dilemma. Anticommons dilemmas arise when limitations in access lead to underuse. A paradigm was developed in which two participants shared a common resource of 100 points. Using the resource was only possible if both parties reached an agreement. In the experiment, participants were asked to indicate how many points they would like to receive (WTA values) to grant the other party access to the resource. Likewise, they were asked how many points they would like to spend (WTP values) to get access themselves. Before the indication of WTA and WTP, half of the participants needed to complete a slider task to simulate an effortful task to gain co-ownership of the resource. 237 UK participants were recruited and put in dyads to partake in the online experiment. Results revealed that social value orientation (SVO) strongly impacted the behavior and outcome of anticommons dilemmas. SVO was negatively correlated to WTA values, which suggests that a higher score on SVO (indicating higher prosociality) led to higher willingness to grant the other party access to the resource. Moreover, a positive effect of psychological ownership on WTP values was found. Lastly, it was found that effort did have a significant effect on WTA values in anticommons dilemmas. Participants who were exposed to an effortful task prior to the bargaining game were setting higher WTA values than those who were not.","['Anticommons dilemma', 'commons dilemma', 'social dilemma', 'impact of effort', 'social value orientation', 'WTA', 'WTP']"

“Europe without its external borders equals Europe without Schengen”: The President of the European Council as a securitising force,"Ambatzidellis, Antigoni",['Dr. Hilde van Meegdenburg'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The refugee crisis which engulfed Europe in the period between 2015 and 2017 sparked the proliferation of securitising discourse targeting migrants across the European Union. Whist plenty of scholarly ink has been dedicated to the study of the securitising rhetoric emanating from political representatives of individual EU member states, little attention has been paid to that of the heads of key EU institutions. To fill this gap, I have chosen to examine the President of the European Council’s securitisation of migrants by conducting a discourse analysis on 120 of his speeches, press remarks and interviews that occurred in the years between 2015 and 2017. Having coded this large body of data, I have been able to establish that Tusk systematically securitised migrants by presenting them as existential threats in relation to the Schengen Agreement, public order and security, as well as European values and subsequently calling for policies to regulate their entry into the EU. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the manner in which asylum-seekers are securitised differs to that of ‘irregular’ migrants, in ways that have not been extensively covered in securitisation literature thus far.",['securitisation']

The localization of global norms on women’s political participation in India and Indonesia","Wolff, Elizabeth",['Dr. Hilde van Meegdenburg'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The UN, as a prime global norm entrepreneur, has launched countless efforts to spread its norm on women’s political participation globally. Whether this norm is accepted and implemented on the ground, depends on local contexts. Using Acharya’s (2004) framework of norm localization, it becomes clear that the prevailing traditional and patriarchal norms prevent the substantive participation of women in politics in both India and Indonesia. In India, instances of norm localization have taken place due to the potential for framing, grafting and reconstruction of traditional family norms. The norm of women’s political participation has been reconstructed to fit into the pre-existing familial structures. In Indonesia, no such localization has taken place. Strong religious and cultural norms, and the absence of frameworks for reconstruction, prevent norm localization. Instead, evidence points towards norm resistance. Even though instances of norm localization have taken place only in India, this has not led to a substantial change in the level of norm implementation between the countries. In both India and Indonesia, the norm is accepted on paper, but in reality, the traditional social norms prevent the full and equal participation of women in the political realm.","['global norms', 'norm localization', ""women's political participation"", 'norm implementation', 'norm diffusion', ""women's rights""]"

Rape without punishment? Ending impunity for peacekeepers that commit sexual exploitation and abuse.,"Abels, Fenja","['Kinacioglu, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) perpetrated by UN peacekeepers has been a pressing issue since the 1990s. Throughout the years, the UN has been scrutinized for contributing to a culture of impunity, in which cases of SEA are not appropriately reported and investigated, and in which perpetrators do not receive adequate penalties. In 2017, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres proposed a “New Approach” that provided measures aimed at enhancing criminal accountability through strengthening reporting, investigation, and follow-up. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether the “New Approach” has been successful in effectively setting an end to impunity of peacekeepers. Taking on a qualitative exploratory methodological approach, the puzzle is answered by analyzing the contents of the “New Approach”, and by comparing whether the proclaimed measures for enhancing accountability have been implemented in practice before 2018 and from 2018 on. I find that the “New Approach” is inherently flawed. While some provisions have been implemented that enhance criminal accountability, shortcomings in the reporting and investigation mechanisms remain. Especially, however, there are fundamental flaws in the prosecution mechanisms of substantiated SEA cases, as there are jurisdictional gaps within the UN system. These lead to an impossibility of achieving criminal accountability for all perpetrators. Thus, the ”New Approach” was ineffective in ending impunity of peacekeepers that commit SEA.","['sexual exploitation and abuse', 'impunit', 'criminal accountability', 'UN peacekeeping']"

Debts and tolls: how capital flows contributed to the treaty-making revolution of the 19th century,"Raudonikis, Julius Edvilas","['Vergerio, C.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This bachelor's thesis examines to what extent did growing cross-border capital flows contribute to the treaty-making revolution of the 19th century. Through a case-study approach, the thesis analyzes two significant cases, Latin America and the German Zollverein, to understand the relationship between cross-border capital flows and treaty-making innovations. The findings demonstrate that cross-border capital flows to a large extent contributed to treaty-making innovations in these two cases. In Latin America, debt relationships between newly independent states and lender banks became the basis for signing sovereignty-recognizing treaties, even without full territorial control. In Europe, the desire for greater cross-border capital flows and German economic integration led to the creation of the Zollverein, the first-ever customs-union agreement. The Zollverein treaties not only increased in quantity but also pushed treaty-making towards a more positivist direction, introducing clauses that standardized weights and currencies. The uniqueness of these Latin America and Zollverein cases, along with subsequent similar treaties, supports the conclusion that cross-border capital flows at least to some extent contributed to the treaty-making revolution of the 19th century.","['Capital flows', 'Treaty-making revolution', 'International law', '19th century', 'Zollverein', 'Latin America']"

Herkenning van naturalistische gezichtsuitdrukkingen door kinderen: Invloed van intensiteit en de aanwezigheid van een positieve bias,"Es, Hannelore van",['Chris Riddell'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het nauwkeurig herkennen van gezichtsuitdrukkingen is een belangrijke vaardigheid die een rol speelt in de sociale ontwikkeling van een kind. Deze vaardigheid is eerder onderzocht met intense, geposeerde gezichtsuitdrukkingen van volwassenen, maar omdat dit niet de gezichtsuitdrukkingen zijn waar kinderen dagelijks mee in aanraking komen heeft dit onderzoek gekeken naar deze vaardigheid met naturalistische gezichtsuitdrukkingen. Het doel was om te kijken naar de overeenstemming tussen de intensiteit van een gezichtsuitdrukking en de correcte herkenning hiervan door kinderen. Bovendien is er gekeken of kinderen emoties met een lage intensiteit hogere blijheidscores zouden geven, wat zou kunnen wijzen op een positieve bias. Hiervoor is er gebruik gemaakt van zelf verzamelde emotie stimuli, waarbij gezichtsuitdrukkingen opgewekt zijn via een emotie opwekkingstaak. Een groep onafhankelijke participanten (n = 47) heeft de intensiteit van deze gezichtsuitdrukkingen op een schaal van 0-100 gescoord. Uit de resultaten bleek dat de video’s met een hoge intensiteit niet beter werden herkend door kinderen dan de video’s met een lage intensiteit. Bovendien, in tegenstelling tot onze verwachting, gaven volwassenen hogere blijheidscores aan de lage intensiteit video’s dan kinderen. Mogelijk heeft het gebruik van naturalistische, dynamische gezichtsuitdrukkingen van zowel kinderen als volwassenen het verschil in correcte herkenning door kinderen tussen hoge en lage intensiteit emoties geminimaliseerd. Ook de afwezigheid van een positieve bias zou verklaard kunnen worden door het gebruik van onze methode, waarbij geen gebruik gemaakt werd van gedwongen keuze. Of deze verklaringen standhouden moet in vervolgonderzoek verder onderzocht worden.","['Emotieherkenning, naturalistische emotie stimuli, gezichtsuitdrukkingen, positieve bias']"

Gezien deze toename is het nuttig om vroegtijdige risicofactoren te achterhalen, zodat interventies vroeg in de kindertijd kunnen worden ingezet. De directe omgeving, waaronder de ouders, is van invloed op de angstontwikkeling van het kind. In deze studie wordt de relatie onderzocht tussen de angst van ouders en de angst van het kind, met daarbij een overbeschermende opvoedstijl als mediërende factor. Methode: De participanten zijn 114 ouders van 3 tot 6-jarige kinderen. Eén inclusiecriteria was dat de kinderen hoog scoorden op gedragsinhibitie, gemeten met de BIQ-SF vragenlijst. De data is verzameld middels drie verschillende vragenlijsten: PAS-R, POM en STAI. Die respectievelijk de angst van het kind, overbescherming en de angst van ouders maten. Resultaten: De mediatieanalyse toonde aan dat er een significante positieve relatie was tussen de angst van ouders en de angst van het kind en angst van ouders en overbescherming. De relatie tussen de angst van het kind en overbescherming was niet significant. Tot slot is er geen mediatie effect van overbescherming gevonden tussen de angst van ouders en de angst van het kind. Conclusie: Deze studie levert geen bewijs dat een overbeschermende opvoedstijl de relatie medieert tussen de angst van ouders en de angst van het kind. Dit onderzoek toont wel aan dat de angst van het kind voor een deel verklaard wordt door de angst van ouders, tevens wordt een overbeschermende opvoedstijl in geringe mate bepaald door de angst van ouders.",

Psychological problems, gender, mood, and socioeconomic status (SES) are all related to the severity of childhood trauma. Childhood trauma has not only been associated with a lower SES, but also with lower scores on IQ-tests. For example, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect are all negatively correlated with IQ. The relationship between SES, IQ and childhood trauma is not well understood. Especially in a population with individuals that report overall higher levels of traumatic experiences and have a lower IQ, such as offspring of people with a mood disorder. In this study, we investigated the relationship between SES, IQ, and trauma in offspring of parents with a mood disorder. Children (N = 198 and N = 40) participating in the MARIO cohort study were assessed for gender, age, SES, and exposure to childhood trauma (emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect) using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Child IQ-scores were assessed with either the WISC or the WAIS. A linear regression analysis showed that IQ was only weakly related to childhood trauma. In contrast SES was strongly related to childhood trauma. These findings suggest that IQ is not a determinant of childhood trauma in current research but underscores the importance of SES. The significant association between SES and childhood trauma could be further investigated and implemented in clinical practice. Future interventions could for example focus on preventing and/or reducing childhood trauma in children who grow up with a low SES.","['mood disorder', 'IQ', 'intelligence', 'SES', 'socioeconomic status', 'trauma', 'childhood trauma', 'CTQ']"

Studying this relationship is relevant because parental sensitivity is an important aspect in the development of children's attachment and social-emotional behavior. It was investigated whether cognitive functioning and parental perception separately and together are predictors of sensitivity and whether the relationship between the cognitive functioning and the sensitivity of the mother is mediated by parental perception. The sample consisted of 193 first-time mothers with a age between 18.6 en 28.9 years (M= 24.9, SD=2.29) and their infants aged between 18.7 en 24 months (M=20.4, SD=0.7). Sensitivity was observed during two tasks (Free Play and Teaching Task), cognitive functioning was measured with (part of) the WAIS-III and parental perception was measured with a validated questionnaire (the Parental Cognitions and Conduct Toward the Infant Scale, PACOTIS). Single and multiple regressions showed that cognitive functioning is a significant but weak predictor of sensitivity, parental perception is not a significant predictor and cognitive functioning and parental perception together are significant predictors. However, there was no significant indirect effect of cognitive functioning on sensitivity through parental perception. Mothers with a lower IQ have a risk concerning diminished sensitivity towards their child. However more research is required to investigate which other factors contribute to the development of healthy attachment behavior in general and sensitivity specifically.","['MINDS/Een Goed Begin, sensitivity, cognitive functioning, parental perception']"
Chronotype and Functioning: A Network Analysis and Comparison Between Early and Late Chronotypes in a Sample of Students,"Steininger, Tara-Faye","['Rieble, Carlotta']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous research has proposed that the preferred waking and sleeping hours of individuals, the so-called chronotype, plays a role in their overall functioning and wellbeing. It has been theorized that the conflict between sleeping and working hours causes late chronotype individuals to be more prone to psychopathology and reduced overall functioning. Using network analysis, the present paper assesses how chronotype relates to various variables of functioning and psychopathology. An overall network was estimated using a sample of N = 447 students of higher education in the Netherlands. In addition, group networks for EC and LC were estimated and statistically compared using the Network Comparison Test (NCT). Results indicated that chronotype did not play a central role in the overall network. In fact, chronotype was one of the most peripheral nodes, while the psychopathology nodes were the most central. Furthermore, the group networks for early and late chronotype did not demonstrate any significant differences. These results are not in line with previous findings and possible explanations are put forward. Overall, the findings of the present thesis suggest that chronotype may not be as important for functioning and psychopathology as previously thought when viewed through the bigger lens of network analysis.","[': Chronotype, functioning, psychopathology, students, network analysis, network comparison test, netherlands, wellbeing, sleep, social jetlag, WARN-D']"

Previous research has mainly focused on cool EF, and the differences between hot EF and cool EF and their association with social cognition during middle childhood have received only limited attention. The current study examines the differences in effect on social cognition between hot EF and cool EF of children aged 9 to 12, as well as the influence of age and/or sex on this relation. Sixty children aged 9 to 12 participated in this research. The data was collected in Dutch primary schools. The parents of the participating children filled in the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF – child) about their child and the Sociaal Cognitieve Vaardigheden Test (SCVT) questionnaire was filled in by the children. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted including a moderation analysis for age and sex.

Moreover, this is expected to be even more the case when managers come from a profit organisation. By means of questionnaires, an essay and a BART experiment, this study attempted to look into the three hypothesis. The results from this study (N=323) demonstrated most of the hypothesis were not supported. The results did however indicate that the measured responsibility scale and risk taking were significantly negatively correlated and that opportunity construal was found to be higher within profit organisations.

If organisations are not moving toward completing their mandate, they cannot serve the purposes institutionalist theory ascribes to them. Mercosur, an economic integration process with the end goal of becoming a common market, is perceived by public opinion as a dormant organisation. Nevertheless, its activity in the last two decades seems to indicate that it is venturing into a new, non-economic agenda, although this has not been officially mandated to it. This thesis argues that, although Mercosur’s economic goals are currently stagnated, it has become a platform for its member states to further other socio-political interests, which has injected new vitality into the organisation.

The effect of impulsivity on reaction time and performance accuracy in a multisensory perceptual decision-making task,"Caljé, Fong Li","['Schomaker, J.', 'Opstal, F. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Most studies analyzing decision-making in individuals with impaired impulse control focus on decisions based on unimodal senses e.g., auditory or visual systems. Little is known about the effect of impulsivity on overall performance in a decision-making task based on multisensory presentation. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the relationship between impulsivity, reaction time and performance accuracy in a multisensory decision-making task. The task consisted of three modalities (visual, auditory, and audiovisual) and two difficulty levels (easy and hard). Data were obtained from 37 participants between the ages of 16 and 18 years old. Participants were either diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Disruptive Behavioral Disorder (DBD) or were typically developing. Impulsivity was measured using a self-report questionnaire. Due to a small sample of clinical participants, all participants were median split into a low and high impulsivity group. To test the effect of modality, difficulty, and impulsivity on reaction time and performance accuracy two mixed ANOVAs were conducted. The mixed ANOVAs showed no significant effects of impulsivity on reaction time or performance accuracy, thus no significant differences between the low and high impulsivity groups were found. The main effect of modality on reaction time was significant, with a shorter reaction time on the audiovisual trials than on the visual and auditory trials. Moreover, analysis showed a higher performance accuracy on the audiovisual trials compared to the visual and auditory trials. This shows the beneficial effect of multisensory (audiovisual) presentation on reaction time and performance accuracy. The current study confirms that multisensory presentation benefits overall performance but did not find a significant relationship between impulsivity and behavioral performance. Future research could focus on possible differences in multisensory behavioral performance between typically developing individuals and individuals with ADHD or DBD and should include a continuous impulsivity variable.","['impulsivity, multisensory decision-making task, multisensory integration, reaction time, performance accuracy, speed-accuracy trade-off, modality, ADHD, DBD']"

The Effect of Parental Verbal Communication of Threat and Safety on the Attentional Bias of Children,"Plagmeijer, Kelly","['Aktar, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common types of psychopathology. Parent-child interactions play a prominent role in the development of SAD. Verbal information from parent to child has been shown to be a potential mechanism for the transfer of fear. The current study aimed to investigate this transfer from parent to child by exploring the effect of parental verbal communication of threat and safety information on children’s attentional bias. Additionally, it was investigated whether the overall anxiety levels of parents would moderate this effect. The sample included 68 children aged 10 to 14 (38 girls and 29 boys, Mage = 11.23, SD = 1.17, range 9.57 - 14.28) and their parents (68 mothers and 55 fathers). The attentional bias was operationalized by using recorded videos of the social tasks performed by the children to calculate the total duration and frequency of the child's gaze at a safety-paired stranger and a threat-paired stranger. The results revealed no significant effect of parental verbal communication of threat versus safety on children’s attentional bias. Moreover, parental anxiety scores did not moderate this effect. The findings suggest that threat and safety information received verbally from parents does not influence the child's fear response. Our findings are not in line with previous studies, highlighting the importance of future research that will further clarify the mechanisms playing a role in the verbal transmission of threat and anxiety from parent to child.","['Social anxiety disorder, Attentional bias, Parent-child interaction, Children']"

De deelnemers aan het onderzoek waren jonge mannen (N= 66); deze groep was atypisch voor de onderzochte non-profit organisatie.

However, the causal mechanisms of the concept of guardianship within this theory lack experimental substantiation. The current study aims to capitalize on this research gap by testing the accuracy of RAT in practice, while also assessing the effects of offender-guardian identity similarities using Social Identity Theory (SIT) and deindividuation theory. The research question that is examined is: Does the presence of guardians inhibit cheating behavior, and is this relationship influenced by offenders’ perception of guardians as members of the in-group rather than the out-group? Participants performed an online quiz in which they could cheat. They either did the quiz alone, in the presence of in-group or out-group bystanders. In- and out-groups were manipulated through gender. Inconsistent with prior expectations, a one-way ANOVA showed no significant differences in cheating behavior between the conditions. Also, planned contrast analyses indicated no significant effects of the presence and the social identity of guardians on cheating behavior. Thus, failing to support the notion in RAT that the presence of guardians inhibits criminal behavior and negates the impact of social identity similarities between offender and bystander. However, these results could be subject to the inability to create strong group identities. Future research could therefore implement another manipulation criterion and conduct the quiz offline.","['routine activity theory', 'cheating behavior', 'social identity theory']"

Het studentenleven kan veranderingen en academische stressoren met zich meebrengen die van invloed kunnen zijn op de fysieke activiteit van studenten. Het voornaamste doel van dit onderzoek is om deze dynamiek tussen academische eisen en fysieke activiteit en de rol van zelfeffectiviteit hierbij te begrijpen om fysieke activiteit bij studenten te bevorderen. Methode: Voor dit cross-sectioneel onderzoek hebben 152 universiteitsstudenten een vragenlijst ingevuld om academische eisen (mentale belasting en tempo en hoeveelheid werk), fysieke activiteit en zelfeffectiviteit te beoordelen. Een meervoudige regressieanalyse werd uitgevoerd om de relatie tussen academische eisen en fysieke activiteit te onderzoeken. Een meervoudige regressieanalyse met interactie-effect werd gebruikt om het modererende effect van zelfeffectiviteit te onderzoeken. Resultaten: De resultaten toonden een significante relatie tussen academische eisen en fysieke activiteit bij studenten. Het modererende effect van zelfeffectiviteit werd in deze relatie als niet significant bevonden. Zelfeffectiviteit voorspelde echter onafhankelijk van academische eisen een deel van de variantie in de fysieke activiteitniveaus van studenten. Discussie: Hoewel zelfeffectiviteit de relatie tussen academische eisen en fysieke activiteit niet modereerde, bleek een hoge zelfeffectiviteit geassocieerd te zijn met lagere fysieke activiteitsniveaus. Het verband tussen zelfeffectiviteit en een verhoogd streven naar perfectionisme zou deze relatie kunnen verklaren. Het aanbieden van fitnessprogramma’s op universiteiten zou daarom een effectieve strategie kunnen zijn om fysieke activiteit bij studenten te bevorderen. Toekomstig (longitudinaal) onderzoek met objectieve metingen van fysieke activiteit zou echter meer nauwkeurige resultaten kunnen opleveren en dient aanvullende (modererende) factoren te onderzoeken en interventies te ontwikkelen die zowel academische eisen als zelfeffectiviteit aanpakken om fysieke activiteit bij universiteitsstudenten te bevorderen.","['zelfeffectiviteit', 'academische eisen', 'fysieke activiteit', 'universiteitsstudenten']"

From Negative Expectancies to a Nocebo Effect: Can Fear of Pain Be a Predictor?,"Budak, Çağla",['Gita Nadinda'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Pain is a subjective experience that can be broadly distinguished into two categories, acute and chronic pain. Acute pain is immediate and has a protective function, whereas chronic pain is persistent and its maintenance is influenced by a combination of social, biological, and psychological factors. One of the important elements that can alter pain perception is one’s negative expectations. This happens through a nocebo effect, in which expecting more pain itself increases the pain experience. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that some emotions, such as fear of pain, may be a predictor of the nocebo effect. It is highly important to understand the nocebo effect and find predictors, as it could have great benefits for individuals with chronic pain. In this paper, two hypotheses were investigated; firstly, whether one’s negative expectancies could induce a nocebo effect, and secondly if the fear of pain was a predictor of the nocebo effect. The study had a between-subjects design that included 20 participants aged between 18-23. Participants were randomly assigned to either conditioning or control group, and the control group was conditioned to expect higher pain by using color cues and verbal suggestions. In order to assess the respondents’ fear of pain at the baseline level, FPQ-III was used. The findings supported the first hypothesis by finding a significant nocebo effect (p = 0.018), however, fear of pain was not found to be a predictor (p = 0.402). The significant nocebo effect highlights the importance of framing information and open communication in clinical settings. Furthermore, it is valuable to conduct further research to identify predictors of the nocebo effect, as it can be helpful in identifying patients that are more vulnerable to pain and in developing effective treatment strategies.","['pain, negative expectancies, nocebo effect, fear of pain, FPQ-III']"

The prevalence in women is double the amount in men. More and more studies state that physical activity lowers the symptoms of depression. However, there is a lot of uncertainty regarding the combined influence of gender and intensity of physical activity. Our hypothesis states that the intensity of physical activity decreases the symptoms of depression less in women than it does in men. A correlational survey study was conducted. The respondents needed to be adults to qualify (between ages of 18 and 65). We then used the Global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ) to measure physical activity. To measure the level of depression we used the PHQ-9. We had 105 respondents to use for the data-analysis, and after selection 90 remained. Our linear regression shows the values P > 0.05, so our null hypothesis was not valid based on our sample. Combined, our independent variables (gender & METtotal) explained 3,8% (R2 = 0.038) of the score on the PHQ-9. Based on our study we cannot presume that gender and intensity of physical activity influence depressive symptoms. The design of our study was not sufficient. Researchers have not been able to get the distinction between depression, gender and intensity of physical activity entirely clear, yet depression remains a population wide issue. Therefore, we propose a longitudinal study in which we look at the biological components in detail that underlie these phenomena.",

To teach reading comprehension in a correct way, it is important to know what the skill consists of and what other factors, such as topic interest, have an important role. Reading comprehension is explained as creating a mental coherent representation of the text by using active and passive reading processes. Pre-knowledge, topic interest and the readers’ motivation and gender influence the comprehension processes. In this study we examine the role of the readers topic interest in reading comprehension and whether the readers’ gender, reading motivation and pre-knowledge have an influence on this role. This study has a within-subject design and is performed on students in the fifth and eight grade of primary school. These students filled in a survey where they had to select three interesting and three non-interesting texts from a list. Then, they had to read those six selected texts and were asked to answer six questions about each texts. After this, the researchers graded the answers. The students could receive 1 point per right answer. This resulted in a mean score of zero to six points and was divided in a mean score for the interesting and the non-interesting texts. We found that students had a significant higher score on the texts they selected as interesting than non-interesting. This effect was the same for boys and girls and also the same for children that do or don’t read a lot for fun in their free time. It was also found that children selected texts mostly as interesting when they had more pre- knowledge about that text topic. So it could be said that topic interest and pre-knowledge are important factors that need to be taken in account when teaching reading comprehension.","['begrijpend lezen', 'interesse']"

The article shows how different generations of choral vocalists shape and negotiate performances of gospel music, embedded in the socioreligious and postcolonial context of contemporary Paramaribo. Through studying discourse and embodied performances, I encountered intergenerational tensions and dialogue regarding the use of voice in religious singing practices. The ethnographic film provides a sensory experience, showing how each choir constructs its own vocal sound and socio-religious space. Narrated from the perspective of youth, the film highlights how young vocalists negotiate religious music traditions and modern pop culture, giving new meanings to everyday life religion and making songs their own.","['Gospel', 'Voice', 'Intergenerationality', 'Everyday', 'Religion']"
Gebruik van corticale kromming naast traditionele atrofiematen voor de classificatie van de ziekte van Alzheimer,"Gruppen, Fianne","['Vos, F. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De ziekte van Alzheimer wordt door middel van Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) gediagnosticeerd.

In deze studie wordt daarom onderzocht of de toevoeging van corticale kromming naast het gebruik van traditionele atrofiematen leidt tot een betere classificatie van de ziekte van Alzheimer. Dit is onderzocht door de MRI-scans van 76 Alzheimerpatiënten en 173 controle participanten te classificeren aan de hand van drie modellen: een model met traditionele atrofiematen, een met corticale kromming en een gecombineerd model met alle modaliteiten. Deze modellen zijn getest met een logistische regressie met een LASSO penalty, waarna er een kruisvalidatie uitgevoerd. Op basis van Area Under the Curve (AUC) is bepaald welk model het beste is in het classificeren van Alzheimer. Het gecombineerde model had een hogere accuratesse dan het atrofiemodel, met AUC- waarden van respectievelijk 0,928 en 0,918.

The Effect of Anticipatory Experience of Pleasure on Effort Expenditure in Patients with Bipolar Disorder,"Paludanus, Sofie","['Van Haren, N.', 'Hall, J.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Bipolar disorder (BD), characterized by fluctuations of mood and motivation, depicts behavioral and neurological impairments in reward processing. These impairments seem to be related to anhedonia. The clinical assessment of anhedonia is associated with anticipatory experience of pleasure (AEP). Deficits in AEP in major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) seem to predict a lower effort expenditure for reward. BD is underrepresented in AEP studies, and AEP’s effect on effort expenditure. More research is needed to determine if AEP is in deficit; and if improving this can decrease disability and mortality rates in BD. This study aims to confirm deficits in AEP and effort expenditure in BD and explore possible interactions between BD, AEP, and effort. Data was obtained from the Positive Valence study. 46 BD patients (59% female, M age = 57.6 years, SD = 11.2) and 39 controls (46% female, M age = 49.2 years, SD = 14.1) participated. Participants completed the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS), a self-report measure to score AEP, and the multi-trial Effort Expenditure for Reward Task (EEFRT). This study found a group difference in effort expenditure (p = .012), but not in AEP (p = .963), nor an interaction effect between group + AEP and effort (p = .407). AEP did not predict effort within the BD group (p = .488). This study found that BD patients expended less effort than healthy controls but found no deficits in AEP. It was proposed that anhedonia could be a deficit in consummatory pleasure instead of AEP in BD. More research for AEP in BD is needed to conclude if no deficits occur at all (accounting for the presence/severity of depressive symptoms, medication use, and treatment). Future research in effort expenditure in BD should control for psychomotor activity. This study states that the similarity between BD, MDD and SCZ is overestimated and that therapeutic interventions should be tailored specifically to BD.","['Bipolar disorder', 'Anticipatory experience of pleasure', 'Effort expenditure', 'Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale', 'Effort Expenditure for Reward Task']"
Group Therapy for Traumatized Forced Migrants: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Baart, Charlotte","['Molendijk, Marc']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: The number of forced migrants worldwide has been rising for years. Many forced migrants suffer from PTSD, yet demand for mental health care is high and waiting times long. Group-based interventions provide a solution, as they allow for the treatment of more patients. They also provide some unique benefits beyond those of individual therapy. Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of group-based psychological and psychosocial interventions in reducing symptoms of PTSD in child, adolescent, and adult forced migrants, and to investigate treatment predictors (treatment type, gender, age, and number of sessions). Methods: We conducted systematic searches in PubMed and Web of Science, searched the preprint server Biorxiv.org, and performed a grey literature search (final search date: March 9, 2022). A random-effects model was used for data synthesis, and moderator and subgroup analyses were performed with the predictors. Results: The systematic search yielded 38 eligible studies, including 43 treatment arms. Results showed significant effects of group therapy in reducing PTSD symptoms (Cohen’s d = -0.89, 95% CI = [-1.06, -0.72], SE = 0.085, z = -10.437, p < .001), with substantial heterogeneity. It is likely that publication bias existed. The selected predictors did not affect outcomes. Conclusion: Group therapy effectively reduces PTSD symptoms in forced migrants. Considering its cost and time efficiency and other benefits, practitioners should consider implementing group therapy (more frequently). Future studies will need to consider other predictors, compare group therapy with individual therapy, and evaluate long term effects.","['forced migrants', 'refugees', 'asylum seekers', 'PTSD', 'group therapy']"
Quality of parent-child relationships and the inflammatory response to acute stress in adolescents,"Semiz, Selma",['Dr. Lisa Schreuders'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In adolescence, the quality of a parent-child relationship is especially important as it can affect the adolescent’s development in various ways. One of the areas of development it can influence is the development of the immune system. Parent-child relationships achieve this through causing the adolescent stress, as stress has been shown to negatively influence immune regulation and development. With this study we aimed to discover how the quality of parent-child relationships affect an adolescent’s immune response to acute stress and whether this relationship is different between males and females. The sample consisted of 79 participants, all Dutch adolescents, ages 14 to 16, with even numbers of boys and girls. Inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α) served to measure the size of the participant’s immune response to stress. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was used to induce stress in participants and inflammatory cytokine levels were measured through a blood prick procedure at both pre- and post- TSST. The Network of Relationships Inventory (NRI) measured the quality of the parent-child relationship, where a majority of participants reported on their relationship with their mother. A Repeated Measures Analysis of Covariance (RMANCOVA) was performed, with the quality of the parent-child relationship and the adolescent’s BMI as covariates, and sex of the adolescent as the between-group variable. Quality of parent-child relationship did not affect the change in inflammatory cytokine levels between pre- and post- TSST, nor was this relationship different between boys and girls. However, IL-6 and TNF-α levels were generally higher in boys than in girls. To conclude, we did not find adolescent’s immune responses to stress to be affected by the quality of their parent-child relationship. We, furthermore, did not find the sex of the adolescent to play a role in the aforementioned relationship. Instead, we found that boys, ages 14 to 16, generally have higher levels of cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α than girls, ages 14 to 16. These findings further our understanding of sex-based differences in inflammatory responses, and sets precedent for further exploration of the mechanisms through which parent-child relationships affect an adolescent’s immune responses to stress.","['Adolescents', 'Parent-child relationship', 'inflammation', 'acute stress', 'inflammatory cytokines', 'Trier-Social Stress Test']"
The relationship between resilience and cognitive functioning in healthy adults,"Ditvoorst, Nathan","['Hulst, H.

As such, this study investigated the relationship between resilience and cognitive functioning in employed healthy adults. Resilience was measured using the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), while objective cognitive functioning was measured by means of a composite score combining information on information processing speed (Symbol digit modalities test), verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test-II), and visuo-spatial memory (Spatial recall test). In total, 30 participants aged were included in this study, of which 16 were female (53.3%) and 14 were male (46.7%). The age of the participants ranged between 19 and 59 years old. No significant correlation between resilience and cognitive functioning was found (N = 24, τ = .196 p = .193). A post-hoc analysis showed that there was a positive relationship present between resilience and cognitive functioning, when the correlation was calculated for females only (N = 14, r = .719, p = .004). No such relationship was found when the correlation was calculated for males only. It is recommended that future research investigates whether there are indeed differences between sexes on the relationship between psychological resilience and cognitive functioning, like the one reported here. In addition, this study encourages the further analysis of resilience and its relationship with cognition as well as its subdomains in healthy adults, to get a clearer picture if and how the two are related to one another, so that health programs could make potential use of psychological resilience, as to improve a person’s overall quality of life.",

The Role of Young Adult Cancer Survivors’ Self-esteem in Disclosing a Cancer History to (Potential) Romantic Partners And Satisfaction With Their Relationship Status: Self-esteem in Cancer Disclosure and Relationship Status Satisfaction,"Ellwart, Jana","['van Laarhoven, A. I. M.', 'van Beugen, S.', 'Lehmann, V.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Having cancer during childhood and facing its consequences might affect the development of self-esteem of young cancer survivors. Later in life, self-esteem can play a role in how one feels in romantic relationships or in singlehood, which might affect how satisfied one feels with their current relationship status. Additionally, self-esteem can affect self-disclosure regarding cancer in romantic relationships of young adult cancer survivors. Aim: Hence, the present study investigated whether survivors with different levels of self-esteem differ in the difficulty to disclose their cancer history to (potential) romantic partners. It was hypothesized that survivors with lower self-esteem levels had more difficulties disclosing a cancer diagnosis to (potential) romantic partners than survivors with higher self-esteem levels. Additionally, it was examined whether self-esteem adds to survivors' relationship status satisfaction next to their current relationship status. It was hypothesized that relationship status and self-esteem contribute to how satisfied survivors are with their current relationship status. Methods: A sample of 497 young adult cancer survivors, who were diagnosed with cancer before they were 18 years old and have been at least five years past their diagnosis were asked to answer questionnaires regarding their self-esteem, difficulties regarding cancer disclosure and relationship status satisfaction using a cross-sectional design. Results: An ANCOVA revealed that survivors with lower self-esteem levels experience more difficulties disclosing a cancer history to (potential) romantic partners than survivors with higher levels of self-esteem, indicating a small effect size. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that relationship status and self-esteem significantly contributed to relationship status satisfaction, with a bigger role of relationship status than of self-esteem. Conclusion: Overall, self-esteem appears to be little relevant for cancer disclosure or relationship status satisfaction. Relationship status is most important for this satisfaction. So, survivors who have a committed romantic partner are more satisfied with their status than survivors who are single.

Visuo-respiratory Synchronisation in Automated Vehicles. A novel Technique to increase Take-over Speed?,"Radbruch, Merlin",['Francesco Walker'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Background: To date, automated vehicles (AVs) still require human drivers to take back control upon request. When a take-over request (TOR) is issued, efficient and safe interaction between the AV and the driver needs to be ensured. Visuo-respiratory synchronisation has been proposed as a novel technique to reduce reaction time (RT) to TORs. Objective: In this study, we manipulated visuo-respiratory synchronisation in an automated driving simulation study. We hypothesize that exposing drivers to synchronised ambient light reduces RT and crash rate. In an exploratory fashion, we investigate trust in automation and heart-rate variability (HRV) development. Methods: During a 15-min automated driving phase, drivers were exposed to different types of ambient light. 57 participants were assigned to one of three conditions of pulsing ambient light: synchronised with their breathing (synchronised), in a set frequency (repetitive), or absence of ambient light (no-light). The automation phase ended with the AV issuing a TOR. Drivers had to react as quickly as possible to avoid an obstacle. Results: No significant differences in RT or crash rate between groups were found. An exploratory analysis yielded a significant increase of trust in automation after the simulation compared to before. HRV analysis showed no clearly interpretable results. Conclusion: Our results are conflicting with the results of prior research on visuo-respiratory synchronisation. More research is needed to determine whether visuo-respiratory synchronisation is an effective technique to increase take-over speed in automated driving.","['Automated Driving, Visuo-respiratory Synchronisation, Take-over Requests, Trust, Heart Rate Variability']"
Leesmotivatie op de basisschool: Een onderzoek naar de houding en het gedrag van leerkrachten wat betreft leesmotivatie van kinderen,"Oskam, Femke","['Koornneef, A.W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Er is in Nederland een achteruitgang te zien in de leesvaardigheid en leesmotivatie van kinderen (Gubbels et al., 2019). Een goede leesvaardigheid is van belang om succesvol te kunnen deelnemen aan de maatschappij (Gubbels et al., 2019). Leesmotivatie is van invloed op de leesvaardigheid van kinderen (Brandt et al., 2021). Een belangrijke factor die van invloed is op het stimuleren van de leesmotivatie van kinderen is de leerkracht (Fletcher et al., 2012). In dit onderzoek is er gekeken naar de houding en het gedrag van leerkrachten op de basisschool wat betreft het stimuleren van leesmotivatie. Er is onderzoek gedaan met behulp van 4 focusgroepen met in totaal 21 basisschoolleerkrachten. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat leerkrachten over het algemeen goed rekening houden met hun houding en gedrag wat betreft het stimuleren van leesmotivatie. Veel leerkrachten zetten meer in op intrinsieke motivatie dan op extrinsieke motivatie. Om in te spelen op de intrinsieke motivatie moet er door leerkrachten rekening gehouden worden met de drie basisbehoeften autonomie, competentie en verbondenheid (Ryan & Deci, 2000a). Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat er door leerkrachten minder op verbondenheid wordt ingezet dan op autonomie en competentie. Daarnaast vinden veel leerkrachten leesmotivatie belangrijk en zijn veel leerkrachten zich bewust van hun houding en invloed daarvan op de klas. Voor leerkrachten die minder lezen en leesmotivatie minder belangrijk vinden is het van belang dat zij extra rekening houden met instructiestrategieën en leesbevorderingsactiviteiten. Verder vinden een aantal leerkrachten dat zij bepaalde kennis missen om leesmotivatie goed te kunnen stimuleren. Het is belangrijk dat met vervolgonderzoek duidelijk wordt welke kennis er ontbreekt.","['Leesmotivatie, leerkrachten, gedrag, houding']"
Leesmotivatie in het basisonderwijs: Een focusgroep studie naar de houding en het gedrag van leerkrachten ten opzichte van leesmotivatie,"Dofferhoff, Tamara","['Koorneef, A.W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Met behulp van focusgroepen is onderzoek gedaan naar de invloed van houding en het gedrag van leerkrachten in het basisonderwijs betreffende de leesmotivatie van leerlingen. Aan het onderzoek deden 21 leerkrachten uit Zuid-Holland mee. Bij de focusgroepen is gebruik gemaakt van een topic guide bestaande uit vijf onderdelen: definitie, belang, houding, gedrag en ondersteuning en belemmering. Tijdens de focusgroepen bleek dat leerkrachten een duidelijk beeld hebben hoe een (on)gemotiveerde lezer er uitziet. Alle leerkrachten zien het als een voordeel wanneer leerlingen gemotiveerde lezers zijn. Het belang dat leerkrachten hechten aan leesmotivatie is terug te zien in het gedrag van de leerkrachten. Meer dan de helft van de leerkrachten is actief bezig met het motiveren van de leerlingen. Een klein deel van de leerkrachten is echter terughoudender en noemt als argument daarbij dat er diverse belemmeringen zijn, zoals het ontbreken van kennis en materialen. Bij leerlingen wordt door middel van verschillende werkvormen autonomie, relatie en competentie gestimuleerd. Leerkrachten lijken goed bezig met het stimuleren van leesmotivatie. Dit roept de vraag op waarom de leesmotivatie dan laag is. De reden kan wellicht gevonden worden in de motivatie van leerkrachten. Leerkrachten lijken zich vooral autonoom te voelen en minder verbonden en competent. Doordat de vorm van motivatie invloed heeft op de werkprestaties is de vraag ontstaan of leerkrachten hierdoor minder goed in staat zijn de zelfdeterminatietheorie toe te passen. Vervolgonderzoek zal moeten aantonen in hoeverre leerkrachten zelf intrinsiek gemotiveerd zijn en het effect hiervan op de leesmotivatie van leerlingen.",
Do State and Trait Anxiety Relate to Mild-Threat Visual Attendance?,"Guidry, Alana T.","['Putman, P.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Habitually attending to threat may contribute to anxiety. This threat-oriented attentional bias (AB) may occur in state anxiety (SA) and/or trait anxiety (TA). Current evidence is mixed, possibly due to the low reliability/internal validity of a popular AB measurement tool, the Dot Probe. This study aims to clarify previous findings with a novel tool, the Dual Probe. Hypothesis: We predict those high in TA and SA will exhibit the highest threat-orientation levels, followed by those with solely high SA, then those with solely high TA. We predict low TA/SA to correlate with threat-avoidance or neutrality. Methods: Female Leiden University students (n = 58) completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The Dual Probe task involved two on-screen pictures (mildly-threatening, neutral). After image offset, two letters appeared (50ms) in their respective locations, with participants instructed to press whichever key they saw. Threat-orientation was scored as proportion of threat-associated versus neutral-associated keypresses. Results: Analysis indicated re-test reliability of the Dual Probe (Spearman-Brown of .88). Bivariate Pearson’s r found no correlations between TA/SA and threat-orientation (TA revealed r = .03, p = .817; SA revealed r = -.05, p = .689). A multiple regression found no evidence of interaction effects (F (3, 54) = 0.986, p = .406, R2 = -.001). Discussion: Results suggest either a limited role of threat-oriented AB in the occurrence/maintenance of anxiety, or limitations in the study methods and sample. Possible theoretical connections to existing literature and practical implications for treatment are discussed, alongside future directions for the Dual Probe.","['anxiety', 'attentional bias', 'dot probe', 'dual probe', 'state anxiety', 'trait anxiety', 'TA', 'SA']"

Van denkbeelden naar daden: ideologie als stuwkracht achter oppositiegedrag,"Aukes, Noor",['P.G. Castenmiller'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek gaat over de rechtstreekse invloed van de ideologische positie van oppositiepartijen op de manier van oppositie voeren in Nederland tussen 2002 en 2012. In de literatuur is er aandacht voor de getrapte invloed van ideologische positie, maar de rechtstreekse invloed van de ideologische positie op oppositiegedrag blijft onderbelicht. Bij een rechtstreekse invloed van de ideologische positie is er sprake van een direct verband tussen de ideologische positie en het oppositiegedrag. Bij getrapte invloed wordt daarentegen gekeken naar andere factoren die een rol spelen binnen de relatie tussen ideologische positie en oppositiegedrag. De ideologische afstand tussen de oppositiepartijen en de regering of de regeringservaring van een partij is hiervan een voorbeeld. Met andere woorden: bij rechtstreekse invloed is er een duidelijke en directe relatie tussen de ideologie van een oppositiepartij en de manier waarop deze oppositie voert, terwijl bij getrapte invloed andere factoren van invloed zijn op de manier van oppositie voeren. Vanwege het gebrek aan onderzoek naar de rechtstreekse invloed van de ideologische positie, is dit een verkennend onderzoek. In dit onderzoek wordt de GAL/TAN schaal gebruikt voor de ideologische positionering van de oppositiepartijen. Deze schaal kan worden gezien als de progressieve/conservatieve of sociaal-culturele dimensie van het politieke spectrum. Verwacht wordt dat oppositiepartijen die rechts (TAN) zijn op de GAL/TAN schaal voor een actievere manier van oppositie voeren kiezen dan partijen die links (GAL) zijn op de GAL/TAN schaal. TAN-partijen zijn immers voor een grotere overheid die een morele autoriteit is op het gebied van sociaal-culturele vraagstukken; een actievere manier van oppositie voeren kan daarom worden gezien als een uiting van de ideologie van TAN-partijen. Ook wordt verwacht dat partijen met een extreme ideologische positie kritischer oppositie voeren dan partijen met een ideologie in of rond het centrum. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat TAN-oppositiepartijen inderdaad constructiever oppositie voeren dan GAL-partijen. Daarbij is er geen significant verschil gevonden in het oppositiegedrag tussen partijen met een extreme ideologische positie en partijen met een gematigde ideologische positie.","['oppositiegedrag', 'Nederlandse politiek']"
The invasion that changed everything: An evaluation of the effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on European security and defence policy,"Bosman, Ryan","['Akbik, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused the European security order to collapse. In response, the European Union (EU) has begun re-evaluating its security and defence policies. Consequently, it is worth examining whether the Russian invasion constitutes a critical juncture for the EU’s security and defence policies. The EU’s main policy in this area is the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), while only formalised in 2009 with the Lisbon Treaty, European security and defence policy has a long evolutionary history. However, much of that history shows neglect and little action to achieve further integration. This study conducts a content analysis of the rhetoric used by the High Representative/Vice President (HR/VP) to determine whether the EU called for institutional stability, constrained change, or abrupt change following the Russian invasion. Additionally, the policy decisions of the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) are evaluated to determine whether changes to European security and defence policy can be categorised as layering, displacement, drift, or conversion. These findings are contrasted with a similar evaluation of the EU’s response to the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea to determine whether the contrast allows for the determination that the Russian invasion constitutes a critical juncture. In line with the hypothesis, there is a stark contrast in the EU’s response between the two cases under evaluation, the rhetoric of the HR/VP shows significant calls for abrupt change and the FAC has agreed upon numerous changes to the CSDP. The findings indicate that the Russian invasion represents a critical juncture for the EU’s security and defence policies.","['Russian invasion of Ukraine', 'Annextion of Crimea', 'Common security and defence policy', 'European Union']"
Exploring the relationship between the level of pathological worry and the severity of burnout symptoms,"Cattel, Rosalie Anne","['Verkuil, B.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"A big knowledge gap exists about the cause, pathophysiology and course of burnout symptoms. Therefore, the current study investigates how worry cross-sectionally and prospectively relates to (components of) burnout and tests whether this relation is moderated by gender. Data of self-reported measures in a longitudinal study of 516 participants were analyzed using multiple regression analyses. Our data show a strong, positive cross-sectional relation between the level of pathological worry and the severity of burnout symptoms. However, the course of burnout symptoms was best predicted by burnout symptoms at baseline and worry did not additionally predict burnout symptoms. Moreover, the components emotional exhaustion and lowered professional efficacy were related to worry, whereas cynicism was not related. Additionally, the study could not confirm that gender moderates between worry and burnout. It can be concluded that the level of pathological worry and (two components) of burnout are positively related. Yet this association is not moderated by gender. A limitation of this study is that the measurements were based on self-reported inventories in an uncontrolled environment. Our findings strengthen the model of PC and create a basis for further research. An opportunity for future research is to further study the relation of worry in somatic and psychological health. Finally, future research could address the prospective relation of pathological worry of the severity of burnout symptoms in a clinical sample, since this relationship has not been researched yet.","['pathological worry, burnout, emotional exhaustion, lowered professional efficacy, cynicism']"

Spelend leren in groep drie: De vormgeving van spelend leren in groep drie volgens onderwijsprofessionals,"Driessen, Anna","['Jolles, D.D.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Abstract Om de overgang van de kleuterklas naar groep drie te vergemakkelijken kan spelend leren worden in gezet in groep drie. De literatuur is echter alleen gericht op spelend leren in de kleuterklas. Over spelend leren in groep drie is weinig bekend. Vandaar dat in deze casestudy kwalitatief onderzoek is gedaan naar de perceptie van onderwijsprofessionals over de vormgeving van spelend leren in groep drie. Hiervoor is een semigestructureerd interview afgenomen bij vijf onderwijsprofessionals (30-58 jaar) betrokken bij de onderbouw van school X. De onderwerpen die in het interview aan bod kwamen waren: definitie, doel, houding van de onderwijsprofessional, bekwaamheid over inzetten, rol van de leerkracht en opbrengsten van spelend leren. Spelend leren is een continuüm dat bestaat uit vijf vormen: vrij spel, onderzoekend spel, samenwerkend spel, spelenderwijs leren en leren door spelletjes. De rechterkant van het continuüm leent zich voor het aanbieden van leerstof en de linkerkant van het continuüm voor het verwerken van leerstof. Daarnaast is uit deze studie gebleken dat in groep drie een combinatie van spelend leren met directe instructie het meeste geschikt is. Vanwege bepaalde academische opbrengsten die alleen behaald kunnen worden met directe instructie en door spelend leren in te zetten om de betrokkenheid van de leerlingen te vergroten. De belangrijke rollen die de leerkracht heeft zijn: faciliteren, begeleiden en observeren van het spel. Uitdagingen die onderwijsprofessionals daarbij ervaren zijn het monitoren van de ontwikkeling van de leerlingen en het tekort aan tijd en middelen voor de voorbereiding van spelend leren. Al met al lijkt het mogelijk om spelend leren in groep drie in te zetten om de overgang van de kleuterklas naar groep drie te verkleinen.","['Spelend leren', 'onderwijs', 'groep 3', 'basisschool']"
Cognitive Functioning and Psychological Well-being in Patients with Anti-LGI1 and Anti-CASPR2 Encephalitis,"Kersten, Laura","['Ghita, I.A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Auto-immune encephalitis (AIE) is a neurological condition with significant cognitive implications that impact the individuals overall well-being. The cognitive status of the individuals with AIE remains unsatisfactorily understood. Anti-LGI1 and anti-CASPR2 encephalitis are two forms of AIE, both occurring in mostly males of late-middle age. This study aims to provide more insight regarding the cognitive impairment and the relationship to psychological well-being. Methods: The study is a cross-sectional observational cohort study in a cohort of 91 patients with AIE (72 anti-LGI1; 19 anti-CASPR2). All patients performed a neuropsychological assessment (NPA; covering memory, executive functions (EF), visual-spatial functions, language) and a questionnaire: the World Health Organization-5-Well-being Index (WHO-5-WBI). The data of the NPA was compared to the norm population from Advanced Neuropsychological Diagnostics Infrastructure Norms (ANDI-Norms) with a T-Test. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to test for type of antibody and improvement at different points of time after diagnosis. A Pearson correlation coefficient was used to test the correlation between NPA and the WHO-5-WBI score. Results: For anti-LGI1, all cognitive domains were significantly lower than the norm population. For anti-CASPR2, memory and total NPA were significantly lower than the norm population. Antibody was significantly predictive for EF (F(1,89) = 4.125, p = .045). Type of antibody, time in months between diagnosis and NPA and an interaction of these were not significantly predictive for EF (F(3,87) = 1.865, p = .141). Psychological well-being was negatively correlated with memory impairment for anti-LGI1 (r = .260, n = 68, p = .032). Discussion: This study determined the underlying cognition and psychological well-being mechanisms in patients diagnoses with anti-LGI1 and anti-CASPR2 encephalitis. Cognitive impairment, especially memory impairment, is evident in anti-LGI1 and anti-CASPR2 encephalitis. The attention span and verbal accuracy, as a part of EF, are significantly lower for anti-LGI1 compared to anti-CASPR2. Cognition improves in the first months after diagnosis, but thereafter stabilizes. Memory impairments, like forgetting information, have a negative influence on psychological well-being for anti-LGI1 patients. The sample size of the present study is larger than previous studies on cognition and psychological well-being of anti-LGI1 and anti-CASPR2 patients.","['auto-immune encephalitis', 'Anti-LGI1', 'Anti-CASPR2', 'cognitive impairment', 'psychological well-being']"

Volgens de oorspronkelijke wijsgeer Pyrrho van Ellis zelf verloopt dit middels uitstel van oordeel omtrent non-evidente zaken. In dit onderzoek is deze eeuwenoude leer onderzocht. De eerste hypothese om deze doctrine te onderzoeken was dat een pyrrhonistische denkwijze positief gecorreleert zou zijn aan gemoedsrust. Daarnaast is de mogelijke invloed van geloof op deze relatie bestudeert. Hiervoor was de verwachting dat de relatie tussen pyrrhonistisch denken en gemoedsrust minder sterk is voor gelovige mensen. Om dit te testen is een testbatterij opgesteld, bestaande uit de Non Evident Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 en Perceived Stress Scale. Aan de hand van de responses van 175 deelnemers, bleek de hoofdanalyse niet significant te zijn bij zowel de GAD-7 als de PSS. Uit de moderatie analyse bleek tevens een insignificant effect. Beide hypotheses kunnen dus worden verworpen. Mogelijke verklaringen hiervoor kunnen zijn dat de verkregen data relatief weinig gelovige mensen bevatte en relatief veel transgender mensen, waardoor conclusies voorzichtiger getrokken dienen te worden. Daarnaast waren de stellingen in de NE-Q voornamelijk gericht op hedendaagse onderwerpen, en is wellicht niet geschikt voor het meten van een dergelijk tijdloos construct.","['Pyrrhonisme, gemoedsrust, geloof']"

It critically examines primary education syllabuses from these countries through a lens of discourse content analysis to elucidate their strategies in cultivating social capital, social inclusion, and social mobility, vital components for achieving societal harmony. The study first reveals how each regime strategically employs education to cultivate social capital, contributing to societal and economic development. It then examines the use of language education and civic studies to promote social inclusion, fostering unity in culturally diverse societies. Lastly, it scrutinizes how these countries embed the concept of social mobility within their syllabuses, viewing education as a pathway for upward societal movement. Unique to authoritarian settings, this research delves into how these states utilize education as a strategic tool for disseminating state ideologies, norms, and values, reinforcing regime durability. It finds that these authoritarian regimes leverage education to exert subtle control over their citizenry and legitimize their rule, contributing to social cohesion and political stability. This thesis offers insights into the complex interplay between education and social cohesion in authoritarian regimes, shedding light on the strategic value of education in these contexts. It provides valuable understanding for policymakers, educators, and researchers interested in education's societal impacts, particularly within authoritarian settings. By studying the unique approaches of China, Singapore, and Indonesia, it underscores the potential of education in promoting social cohesion and contributing to regime durability.","['Social Cohesion, Authoritarian Regimes, Education, Social Capital, Social Inclusion, Social Mobility, Discourse Content Analysis, China, Singapore, Indonesia, State Ideologies, Political Stability, Regime Durability, National Syllabuses, Civic Education.']"
Stakeholder views on faciltators and barriers in eHealth interventions for Individuals with low SEP: A Delphi study,"van Os, Karin",['I. Al-Dhahir'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Low socioeconomic position (SEP) individuals are more likely to develop chronic illnesses and to have poorer health outcomes than the general population. One promising approach to reduce this incidence rate of chronical illnesses is through eHealth interventions. Even so, the uptake of eHealth amongst low SEP individuals is low, and there is a lack of understanding how to best connect eHealth interventions to low SEP individuals. This study therefore aimed to gain insights into the main barriers and facilitators in eHealth for low SEP individuals, by consulting stakeholders (i.e., health professionals and policy makers). In addition, the present study was interested in possible differences between health professionals and policy makers. To assess these research questions, an online Delphi study was conducted. The present study analyzed the ratings of 12 Dutch stakeholders regarding 86 statements on barriers and facilitators in different phases of eHealth (i.e., development, reach, evaluation and implementation). Moreover, a Mann Whitney U test was conducted to assess possible differences in the ratings between health professionals and policy makers. Results revealed that time and financial resources as well as the eHealth intervention content and the involvement of low SEP individuals are key factors in eHealth for low SEP individuals. Additional main factors included the involvement of the social environment of low SEP individuals and the involvement of professionals. Finally, it was found that the employment of continuous evaluation cycles throughout all phases forms a major factor in eHealth for low SEP individuals. Additionally, the results indicated that one statement regarding the importance of user privacy in the development phase received a significantly higher score from policy makers than health professionals. No additional significant differences in scores between health professionals and policy makers were found. This study provides an overview of key barriers in eHealth for low SEP individuals. Understanding these barriers and facilitators may generate insights on how to optimize eHealth interventions for people with a low SEP, and therefore help professionals to connect eHealth to low SEP individuals. Furthermore, the present study could be considered as a building block on which future studies can be conducted.","['chronic ilnesses', 'low socioeconomic status', 'eHealth interventions', 'stakeholders', 'delphi study']"
Expectations about the motivations of others: The effect of age and gender on expectations about others’ prosocial behavior.,"Smit, Dana","['Ma, I.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In this study a social prediction game was used to investigate expectations about others’ prosocial behavior in adolescence. Prosocial behavior can be seen as a voluntary action of a person to help others. There are different motivations to behave prosocially. This study investigated the motivations of selfishness; always wanting more, and risk aversion; avoiding risks. The goal of this study was to investigate adolescents’s expectations about the prosocial behavior of others and if there was a difference in gender and age in these expectations. First, an improvement in the number of correct predictions in the risk averse motivation over age was found. There was no significant improvement of the number of correct predictions in the selfish motivation found. Second, there were no gender differences within the number of correct predictions of both motivations. Third, a significant correlation was found between gender, age and the number of correct predictions, which showed that the number of correct predictions of the risk averse motivation increased with age for girls and the number of correct predictions of the selfish motivation increased with age for boys. In conclusion, there is a gender difference between the expectations of the use of selfish or risk averse motivations of other players in a social prediction game and age has an influence on this difference during adolescence. This means that within the classroom, a different approach for boys and girls is needed to adopt more prosocial and cooperative motivations and expectations.","['Social prediction game, motivation, risk aversion, selfishness, gender, age']"

Daarnaast wordt onderzocht wat de optimale frequentie van afname is. De set meetinstrumenten meet de behandeleffecten bij jongeren met een licht verstandelijke beperking (LVB) die ambulante zorg krijgen. Deze hoofdvraag is beantwoord aan de hand van literatuuronderzoek naar constructen en de daarbij horende meetinstrumenten die de behandeleffecten bij jongeren met een LVB meten. Ook is er een focusgroep ingezet, waarbij medewerkers van Ipse de Bruggen werd gevraagd naar belangrijke elementen van meetinstrumenten en de gevonden constructen. Op basis van het literatuuronderzoek zijn de volgende vier constructen geformuleerd die belangrijk zijn om behandeleffecten te kunnen meten bij jongeren met een LVB; adaptieve vaardigheden, zelfredzaamheid, emotionele- en gedragsproblemen en cognitieve vaardigheden. In totaal zijn zes meetinstrumenten gevonden die deze constructen meten. Deze meetinstrumenten worden in dit adviesrapport in detail besproken. Uit literatuuronderzoek is over de frequentie van het afnemen van deze meetinstrumenten naar voren gekomen dat er geen eenduidig beleid is, maar de voorkeur is om tweemaal, voor en aan het einde van de behandeling, de ROM-metingen te doen. Nadat meerdere constructen en meetinstrumenten onderzocht zijn door middel van het literatuuronderzoek, werd een focusgroep georganiseerd. Tijdens deze focusgroep gaven de medewerkers hun mening over de gevonden constructen, meetinstrumenten en de frequentie van afname. Daarnaast vertelden zij over hun eigen ervaringen met meetinstrumenten die bij Ipse de Bruggen al worden gebruikt. Tijdens de focusgroep is ook het belang van het afnemen van meetinstrumenten besproken en zijn de beperkingen van het gebruik van meetinstrumenten in het algemeen besproken. De belangrijkste constructen om te meten bij jongeren met een LVB waren volgens de medewerkers: ‘Emotieregulatie’ en ‘Psychische Problemen’. Het advies op basis van zowel het literatuuronderzoek en de focusgroep is om de volgende meetinstrumenten af te nemen in ROM-metingen indien de constructen (adaptieve vaardigheden, zelfredzaamheid, emotionele- en gedragsproblemen en cognitieve vaardigheden) passen bij het behandeldoel van de jongere met een LVB; Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Sociale Redzaamheidsschaal interview (SRZ-i), Adaptive Ability Performance Test (ADAPT), Fragebogen zur Erhebung der Emotionsregulation bei Kindern und Jugendlichen (FEEL-KJ), Children’s Depression Inventory-2 (CDI-2) en/of Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Ook is het advies om de meetinstrumenten aan het begin en aan het eind van de behandeling af te nemen. Minimaal één keer per jaar zouden de meetinstrumenten afgenomen moeten worden, en indien dat haalbaar is, dan elke drie maanden. Tot slot worden in de conclusie en het advies aanbevelingen gedaan voor vervolgonderzoek en worden sterke punten en beperkingen van dit onderzoek besproken.","['Behandeleffecten, LVB, jongeren, jeugd']"
Thinking out of the box in the classroom: The influence of teachers on intelligence and creativity in primary school children,"Oldenhuis, Annejet","['Stolte, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this study, the influence of teachers’ attitudes, beliefs and opinions regarding the creative and intellectual abilities of primary school children on the achievement of these children is investigated. Intelligence and creativity are both crucial for problem solving, high achievement and reasoning on a daily basis. The first hypothesis states that intelligence and creativity have a positive relationship, where intelligence predicts creativity, according to the “necessary but not sufficient” hypothesis. The second hypothesis states that the influence of teachers operates as a moderator in this relationship, thus strengthening the connection between intelligence and creativity. According to the idea that the social context is important in the development of intelligence and creativity and that this development commences early in childhood, teachers are seen as influential in this development. Intelligence is measured through the Nederlandse Intelligentietest voor Onderwijsniveau (NIO). Creativity is measured through the Creative Problem Solving task (CPS) and the Test of Creative Thinking and Drawing Production (TCT-DP). Teachers’ opinions is measured through a questionnaire. Results show that intelligence does significantly predict creativity, but that teachers have little to no influence on this connection and therefore do not operate as a moderator. Further research is needed to investigate the influence of teachers more comprehensive, expand the use of intelligence tests, examine the effects of a longitudinal instead of a cross-sectional study design, and look into the possible influence of parents, age and gender on the development of intelligence and creativity.","['intelligence', 'creativity', 'primary school children', 'teachers', 'social environment']"
The Relationship of Reward Anticipation with Alcohol Consumption in Patients with Bipolar Disorder Type I,"Grinten, Julia van der","['Anne Cuperus', 'Annabel Vreeker', 'Marisha Meijer']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Patients with bipolar disorder type I (BD-I) who consume alcohol, experience stronger than average negative effects from this consumption, as it leads to lower adherence to treatment and increased suicide attempts. Independently, excessive alcohol consumption is associated with lower reward anticipation, which is a mechanism that helps making decisions that minimize harm. Using the concept of reward anticipation, this observational and crosssectional study, aimed to understand the relation between BD-I and alcohol consumption. Understanding this relation could eventually help improve treatment of alcohol related problems among BD-I patients. First is hypothesized that BD-I diagnosis is related to more alcohol consumption, second that lower reward anticipation is related to more alcohol consumption, and third that lower reward anticipation is stronger related to more alcohol consumption in BD-I patients than control participants. Reward anticipation was studied both objectively, with a Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MID), and subjectively, with the Positive Valence Systems Scale (PVSS-21). This created an opportunity to include a fourth hypothesis that the MID and the PVSS-21 are correlated. In collaboration with the Erasmus MC, participants completed online surveys and games to measure reward anticipation and alcohol consumption. The participants included 35 BD-I patients (20 female, Mage = 55.94, SDage = 11.17) and 15 control participants (6 female, Mage = 49.08, SDage = 13.35). First, no relation between BD-I diagnosis and alcohol consumption (OR = .87, 95%CI [.21, 3.59]) was found. Second, no relation between reward anticipation (ORMID = 1.20, 95%CI [.91, 1.57]; ORPVSS = 1.01, 95%CI [.97, 1.05]) and alcohol consumption was found. Third, no stronger relation between reward anticipation (ORMID = 1.20, 95%CI [.88, 1.63]; ORPVSS = 1.00, 95%CI [.99, 1.01]) and alcohol consumption for BD-I patients was found. Fourth, no correlation between scores MID and the PVSS-21 was found (r (50) = .18, p = .21). The results, conflicting with previous research, are likely influenced by the small amount of alcohol consumed by the participants. Making it difficult to make conclusions about the relation between BD-I diagnosis, reward anticipation and alcohol consumption. Further research is recommended with a larger group of participants with more age distribution.","['Bipolar disorder', 'alcohol consumption', 'reward anticipation', 'Monetary Incentive Delay Task', 'MID', 'Positive Valence Systems Scale', 'PVSS-21']"

Play it Cool! Hoe speels sporten kan helpen bij een burn-out,"Gevers, Sacha","['Vries, J. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In 2021 bleek dat maar liefst zestien procent van de werknemers in Nederland kampt met burn-out klachten. Dit gaat samen met een hogere mate van verzuim en daarmee hoge kosten. Daarnaast bleek dat vrouwen vaker kampen met burn-out klachten. Vele onderzoeken bevestigen de positieve resultaten van sport en beweging op het voorkomen en verminderen van burn-out klachten. Echter is het door onder andere vermoeidheid bij een burn-out, lastig om sportieve activiteiten te initiëren. Door deze fysieke inactiviteit blijft juist deze vermoeidheid in stand. Dit onderzoek bekijkt of mensen die kampen met een burn-out gemotiveerd kunnen worden door playful sport design in te zetten. Deze manier van sport benadert training op een speelse manier door proactief plezierige en competitieve elementen toe te voegen. Door middel van een dagboekstudie is data verzameld van N = 118 respondenten, verdeeld over vier weken. De vragen gingen in op de mate van burn-out, de mate van ervaren PSD en in hoeverre de respondent uitkijkt naar een volgende training als indicator voor sportmotivatie. Er bleek een significant positief verband tussen de mate waarin iemand PSD toepast in een training, en de mate waarin iemand uitkijkt naar een volgende sportsessie. Hoe speelser iemand sport, hoe meer diegene uitkijkt naar een de sportsessies in de komende week. Daarnaast bleek deze relatie significant sterker voor mensen met een hoge mate van burn-out klachten dan voor mensen met een lage mate van burn-out klachten. Burn-out blijkt dus een modererend effect te hebben op dit verband, mits er gecorrigeerd is voor geslacht en leeftijd. Mensen die een hoge mate van burn-out klachten ervaren, hebben dus mogelijk meer baat bij sporten op een speelse en competitieve manier. Echter moeten de resultaten met voorzichtigheid worden geïnterpreteerd doordat de steekproef klein is, en er gebruik is gemaakt van zelfrapportages. Hoewel er meer onderzoek nodig is naar dit verband in de praktijk suggereren deze resultaten dat er mogelijk veel te behalen valt op het gebied van sportmotivatie door playful sport design bij mensen die kampen met burn-out symptomen.","['Burn-Out', 'sport', 'motivation', 'stress', 'playing', 'playful sport design']"

Facial mimicry in context: het effect van gender en gedrag van kinderen op de facial mimicry van volwassenen en de mogelijk modererende rol die een gender bias hierbij speelt,"Ruiter, Charlotte","['Bos, P.A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Throughout development, children rely heavily on social referencing to help them make difficult choices and to regulate their emotions and behavior. The expressions and facial mimicry of parents, teachers and other adults who are part of a child’s life play a large role in this process. Although it was first believed that this mechanism was just another part of motor mimicry, results of previous studies tell us otherwise. It appears that expressions and mimicry are strongly influenced by context, such as likeability, bias, and similarity. Based on this knowledge, the current study looked at the effect of externalizing behavior and gender of a child on the automatic facial responses of adults and took a possible moderating effect of an existing gender bias into account. The sample consisted of 25 participants who completed two EMG tasks to measure facial mimicry and the IAT to measure gender bias. Results show that there appears to be a difference in mimicry when looking at happy boys. Participants frown more towards happy externalizing boys than towards happy internalizing boys, a possible sign of disapproval. Bias also appeared to have an effect. Only participants with a lower bias score showed the aforementioned behavior towards happy boys, possibly because of the influence of expectations and empathy. The results show us that a small amount of information can influence the way adults behave towards children, even if the viewer is not familiar with the child.","['Facial mimicry', 'EMG', 'gender bias', 'emotions']"

Revisiting the ‘Convergence Hypothesis’ and its Foundational Arguments: In defence of an ecocentric approach to climate change,"Gregory, Olivia","['Belic, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"With the increasing and unprecedented threat of climate change, the ethical frameworks guiding climate policies and shaping the way humans relate to nature need urgent review. The publishing of Bryan Norton’s (1991) ‘Convergence Thesis’, which purports the idea that both anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric approaches converge at the level of practical policy proposals, made some issues in environmental ethics appear resolved and gave much more force to weak anthropocentrism. Consequently, weak anthropocentrism largely became the standard by which environmental policies were measured and justified. However, this thesis finds that the ‘Convergence Hypothesis’ and it’s weak anthropocentrist foundations are flawed (1) at a practical level, as there is divergence; (2) at the ethical level, as the weak anthropocentric position promoted by the Convergence Hypothesis would support bad policies, and (3) at the conceptual level, as weak anthropocentric attempts to articulate why undesirable policies shouldn’t be supported would mean the position collapses into non-anthropocentrism. Thus, concluding that non-anthropocentric, or more specifically ecocentric, valuations of nature will best enable policies that meet today’s demands of climate change.","['Ecocentrism', 'Anthropocentrism', 'Non-anthropocentrism', 'Convergence Hypothesis', 'Intrinsic value', 'instrumental value', 'rights of nature']"
"Child Maltreatment, Depression and Protective Factors on the Risk of Suicidal Behaviors and Ideation: A Network Approach","Haneveld, Cheyenne",['Myrthe Veenman'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction: Child maltreatment, such as sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect, have a great impact on the development of the brain and psychological health. Child maltreatment often leads to mental problems such as depression and suicide. It is however still unclear if there are differences between forms of child maltreatment and their relation to mental problems, such as suicidal behaviors. This research is interested in the specific relations that different forms of abuse might have with suicidal behaviors. Methods: In this study, we applied a Gaussian Graphical network model with regularization, that shows how the different forms of maltreatment are related to depression and suicidal behaviors and ideation. The sample size exists of 445 students that participated in the first trial of the WARN-D study. The participants filled in questionnaires with questions regarding among others child maltreatment, depression, suicidality, and social support. The network analysis is run in JASP (2022). Results: This study has found considerable correlations but of moderate strength. We found mostly positive partial correlations between emotional neglect and variables about suicidality, such as passive and active suicidality, suicide attempt and nonsuicidal self-injury. We also found that sexual abuse seems to have a relationship with passive suicidality and nonsuicidal self-injury. Lastly, social support seems to act as a protective factor for negative outcomes, since the results showed negative correlations between social support, depression, and suicidal behaviors. We have found that there are some differences in the psychological outcome of child maltreatment and with these results, we will understand de process of suicidal behaviors a bit better than before.","['Child maltreatment, depression, suicide, social support, network analysis']"

INVLOED VAN HOT EN COOL INHIBITIE OP AGRESSIEF GEDRAG BIJ KINDEREN MET EEN VERHOOGD RISICO OP EXTERNALISEREND GEDRAG,"Rutten, Iris","['Meijer, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Aggressive behavior of children or adolescents has long term consequences for themselves and society. Inhibition deficits can contribute to aggression. Inhibition can be divided into hot and cool inhibition. Cool inhibition is characterized by abstract, decontextualized problems and hot inhibition is characterized by problems that involve the regulation of affect and motivation. The aim of the current study is to investigate the relation between hot or cool inhibition and aggressive behavior in children with a higher risk of externalizing behavior. Furthermore, the influence of age on the relation between hot or cool inhibition and aggressive behavior in children with a higher risk of externalizing behavior is investigated. It is expected that hot inhibition is stronger related to aggressive behavior than cool inhibition. Furthermore, it is expected that age influences the relation between hot and cool inhibition and aggressive behavior. Hot and cool inhibition are measured by two subtasks of the Amsterdamse Neuropsychologische Taken (ANT). Hot inhibition is measured with ANT-Delay Frustration and cool inhibition with ANT-Shifting attentional Set Visual. Aggressive behavior is measured with the Instrument voor Reactieve en Proactieve Agressie (IRPA) questionnaire which is filled in by the teacher. The data are analyzed by performing linear regressions, multiple regressions and moderation analysis. Results indicated no separate or joint relation of hot and cool inhibition with aggressive behavior. Also, age did not influence the relation between hot or the speed component of cool inhibition and aggressive behavior. On the other hand, age did moderate the relation between the accuracy component of cool inhibition and aggressive behavior. Future research also needs to investigate other types of executive functioning and their influence on different forms of aggression. This will help in developing preventive programs and interventions to limit the consequences of the aggressive behavior for the child and society.","['PIT', 'externaliserend probleemgedrag', 'agressie', 'hot inhibitie', 'cool inhbitie']"

"The effect of worrying, anxiety and depression on adherence to creatinine measurement via protocol in post-transplant kidney patients.","Kunst, Jara","['Doef, M. van der']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The objective of this study was to predict adherence to measurement protocol based on symptoms of anxiety, depression and worrying in post-kidney transplant patients. Nowadays the aftercare of kidney transplant patients consist of frequent hospital visits for testing. In this study 49 patients were given the opportunity to monitor their symptoms at home instead trough a finger prick to analyse creatine levels in their blood. They took these measurements up to a year after the transplant. Adherence to this protocol was objectively measured by collecting data from The StatSensor® Xpress-i™, the device used to measure creatinine in the blood. Adherence to the protocol was interpreted both as a percentage of adherence (continuous) and adherent or non-adherent (dichotomous). Patients were considered adherent if they performed at least 75% of the measurements prescribed by the protocol. Since non-adherence could lead to serious health risks, it is important to understand its potential risk factors. The level of anxiety and depression was measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and worrying was measured by the Transplant Effects Questionnaire. It was hypothesised that both anxiety and depression would have a negative effect on adherence to the measurement protocol. For worrying a non-linear relation was expected, which means that there would be an optimal level of worrying which leads to better adherence. The relation between these factors and adherence was measured through regression analyses and logistic regression analyses. The analyses showed no significant relation between anxiety, depression, worrying and adherence. Therefore this study showed that symptoms of anxiety, depression and worrying are not risk factors for objective adherence to measurement protocol in post-kidney transplant patients.","['adherence', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'worrying', 'kidney', 'transplant']"
Does your background matter? The mediating effect of parental involvement on the association between socioeconomic background and social competence.,"Lutjenhuis, Marijke",['Mara van der Meulen'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social competence is a key part in the development of children. Social skills help children to follow directions, manage emotions, and improve interpersonal relationships. Therefore, these skills are important for happiness and welfare in adulthood. Several factors influence social development. Previous studies suggest that parental involvement has positive influence on children’s social competence. Science also stated how parents from lower SES-background are less available to their children. The aim of the current study was to test whether there is a relationship between SES, parental involvement and social competence. Furthermore, the current study tested if the relationship between SES and children’s social competence was mediated by parental involvement. Data was used from the L-CID project, a larger twin study from Leiden University. The current study used data from 120 families. By random sampling, from each twin one child was selected for participation. The mean age of the children was 10.94 years old. Results showed a significant positive association between SES and parental involvement. No mediation effect was found. Also, there was no relationship found between SES and social competence, or parental involvement and social competence. The contradicting findings are possibly due to the fact that attachment style, age of children, parental emotional distress, and the amount of time children spend in other environments was not taken into account. However, results did indicate the higher the SES, the more time parents have to support their children. Therefore, for society is remains important to be aware of a child’s background, because this has influence on parent’s involvement at home.","['Parental involvement', 'social competence', 'social behaviour', 'SES']"
Aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG) in subjects with a history of head injury: a post-mortem brain study,"Meijer, Luna","['Ruitenberg, M.F.L.', 'van Amerongen, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG) describes the pathological accumulation of abnormal tau proteins in a specific type of brain cell called: astrocytes. This phenomenon is related to the aging brain but has been predominantly observed in people who have experienced frequent head trauma, such as rugby and soccer players. The presence of ARTAG has been previously linked to head trauma, yet the relationship between trauma and ARTAG development has not systematically been studied. We evaluated whether the degree and amount of head injury is a significant risk factor for the presence of ARTAG in the brain. Data from 128 post-mortem brains, donated to the Netherlands Brain Bank (NBB), were used to determine the ARTAG presence, experienced head injury and the degree of the head injury. On the dataset created, a chi-square test and a binary logistic regression were performed. Results of the chi-square test showed no significant risk factor in ARTAG presence in the brain. Furthermore, the results of a binary logistic regression on ARTAG presence showed that such presence was not significantly associated with experienced head injury. In the logistic regression we adjusted for known risk factors of ARTAG pathology; NFT-pathology, FTLD-pathology, age and sex. When adjusting for these covariables, we were able to confirm that age and the presence of NFT-pathology pose a significant risk for the presence of ARTAG in the brain, as suggested by previous studies. Overall, the present findings do not support the notion that head injury is a risk factor for ARTAG presence in the brain. However, they do align with prior indications that age and NFT-pathology are risk factors for ARTAG presence. For future research, a prospective longitudinal design is recommended to classify and monitor head injury on a more detailed level. Accuracy is of great importance as it is possible that predominantly the repeated head trauma can make a difference in the development of ARTAG.","['ARTAG', 'TBI', 'Headinjury:Alzheimers', 'Dementia', 'Neurodegeneration']"

In the current exploratory, cross-sectional study (N = 442), using a mixed-gender (N = 442) and female (N = 354) subset, it will be examined whether there are relations between personality traits, between CAs, between personality traits and CAs, and if there are differences between a mixed-gender and a female subset network. Participants are students enrolled at Dutch educational institutions between the ages of 18 and 53. Personality traits and CAs are measured with the Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10) and Big Five Inventory-44 (BFI-44), questionnaires adapted from the Caring Universities survey, and the Childhood Trauma Screener (CTQ), respectively. Subsequently, these questionnaires are analyzed using correlational and network analyses in SPSS and JASP, respectively. Overall, almost all CAs co-occur. Furthermore, higher neuroticism scores co-occurred with more sexual abuse and emotional neglect, and vice versa. In contrast, no relation was found between emotional abuse and personality traits. Finally, the association of personality traits and CAs are not stronger in the female subset network than in the mixed-gender network. Future research should use a more representative student sample, with longitudinal design, and evenly distributed gender subsets, to ensure generalizability and causality.","['CA', 'personality', 'childhood adversity', 'network analysis']"

In deze studie is de modererende rol van self-efficacy in de relatie tussen psychologische distress omtrent klimaatverandering en milieuvriendelijk gedrag bij Nederlandse jongeren (16 – 24 jaar) onderzocht. De respondenten (N = 436) hebben een meerkeuze vragenlijst ingevuld over 12 variabelen die gerelateerd zijn aan klimaatverandering. Aan de hand van een lineaire regressieanalyse is een positief verband gevonden tussen psychologische distress en milieuvriendelijk gedrag. Een hoger niveau van psychologische distress bevordert milieuvriendelijk gedrag. Verder is door middel van een simpele moderatie-analyse een modererende rol van self-efficacy gevonden in de relatie tussen psychologische distress en milieuvriendelijk gedrag. Bij een hoog niveau van self- efficacy wordt de relatie tussen psychologische distress en milieuvriendelijk gedrag meer bevorderd dan bij een laag niveau van self-efficacy. Deze resultaten benadrukken het belang van self-efficacy.

While research regarding fathers is important to get the full image about parenthood, this kind of research is still mostly done with mothers. One of the topics within these researches is mind-mindedness. Recent studies have shown that parental mind-mindedness eases the cognitive and social growth of their offspring. Parental mind-mindedness is the ability of a caregiver to acknowledge their child as in having an autonomous mind, in which their child can have his or her own thoughts and emotions. It also includes the ability for the parents to interpret this. Present study is one of the first studies that investigated whether the hormones oxytocin, cortisol or testosterone are related to the mind-mindedness of first time fathers. In total, 71 first time fathers were included in this cross-sectional study. The mind-mindedness of the fathers was measured with an interview. The hormones oxytocin, cortisol and testosterone were measured from the baseline of saliva samples. A multiple regression analysis was used to investigate the relation between the hormones and the mind-mindedness. Prior to the multiple regression analysis, a Pearson’s correlation test was conducted. Although a significant correlation between mind-mind and oxytocin was found, this study has found no evidence that the three hormones together can predict the mind-mindedness of fathers. Limited evidence was found that oxytocin is correlated to parental mind-mindedness. In order to improve the academic knowledge of the field, it is recommended to perform research with enhanced conditions, such as with increased sample size.","['oxytocine, cortisol, testosteron, mind-mindedness']"
Growing up with a chronically ill family member: Resilience and risk of future problems in adolescents,"Ramcharan, Rachel","['Sieh, D.S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The number of adolescents growing up with a chronically ill family member is increasing, putting them at risk of developing psychosocial, emotional, and behavioral problems. This study examines the relation of having a chronically ill family member with adolescent resilience, and explores whether this relation is affected by the type of illness suffered by a family member (somatic, mental, or addiction). Additionally, this study investigates whether adolescent resilience moderates the relationship between the type of illness suffered by a family member and the risk that an adolescent will develop problems in the future. Adolescents (n = 12,348) aged 12 to 18 years (M = 14.22, SD = 1.24), in their second or fourth year of high school in the Netherlands, completed a self-report questionnaire. Of 12,348 adolescents 51.7% were female, 52.2% did pre-vocational secondary education, and 80.7% lived with both their parents. The results indicate that adolescents with a chronically ill family member (n = 3,059) were less resilient than adolescents with healthy family members (n = 9,289). Further, adolescents with mentally ill family members (n = 601) were less resilient than adolescents with somatically ill (n = 2,213) and addicted family members (n = 245). Resilience moderated the relationship between the type of illness suffered by a family member and the risk of future problems. These findings may be explained by the exposure to different home environments and (related) challenges that adolescents face. Resilience may help adolescents cope with future challenges, reducing the risk of future problems. More research is needed to understand how to strengthen resilience and reduce future problems in adolescents with chronically ill family members.","['resilience, risk of future problems, somatic illness, mental illness, addiction, growing up with a chronically ill family member']"

Brain knowledge in children – what do they crave for?,"Grimme, Romy","['Vandenbroucke, A.R.E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present study focuses on the amount of brain knowledge that children have, and specifically, which neuromyths they believe. Previous research suggests that brain knowledge, either right or wrong, can influence the way children think about themselves, and how they behave. If this knowledge is negatively framed, this can have a negative effect on their development. Therefore, we investigated whether curiosity, prior knowledge, and science-related curiosity were predictive of correctly distinguishing neuromyths and truths and whether these same predictors were related to the perceived relevance of brain knowledge in their daily lives. Furthermore, we looked at the difference between children in primary school and in secondary school with respect to how much they want to know about the brain, and what they want to know about the brain was examined. To test this, 321 children in primary and secondary schools, aged between 10 and 15 years, filled out a questionnaire about their curiosity and prior knowledge, and they judged whether 25 statements about the brain (13 myths, 11 facts, and 1 opinion) were right or wrong. We found that curiosity, prior knowledge, and science-related curiosity as measured with a questionnaire were not predictive of being better able to distinguish neuromyths and truths. However, in an exploratory analysis we found that a higher number of correctly detected facts predicted a lower number of correctly detected neuromyths. When looking at perceived relevance, higher levels of curiosity and science-related curiosity predicted higher levels of perceived relevance, while prior knowledge did not. No differences between children who go to primary school and secondary school were found in how much they want to know about the brain. Also, the themes they would like to know more about were quite the same, mostly focused on general brain knowledge and brain development. This is the first study that focuses on neuromyths and brain knowledge in children. It is important that more research is done on the effect of believing neuromyths and the influence it has on children’s behavior.","['brain', 'children', 'development', 'neuromyths', 'perceived relevance']"

However previous research has shown that the reading skills of Dutch 15-year olds is lower than that of surrounding western countries. Reading skills are closely linked with the reading motivation and the reading attitude. Reading skills can potentially be improved when aimed for increasing reading motivation and improving reading attitude. In the present study, the relation between the home literacy environment and the use of digital books on the one hand and reading motivation and reading attitude of 35 Dutch second graders on the other hand is investigated. Participants were divided in a group to which digital books were offered or in a group to which digital books and nudges were offered. Nudges were provided by teachers to pay extra attention to the digital books. The reading motivation and reading attitude of children were measured at a pre- and post-test. The home literacy environment was measured with a questionnaires for parents, the to assess the amount of books at home and parental reading behavior. Results show no relation between reading motivation and reading attitude and the amount of books at home. The reading motivation and reading attitude of children were higher when parents read more. No change in reading motivation was found in the group of students who were offered digital books. However, an increase in reading attitude was found. No change was found in reading motivation and reading attitude in the group of student who were offered digital books and nudges. These results provide support to emphasize the reading behavior of parents in reading interventions to increase the reading motivation and reading attitude.","['Digitale boeken', 'leesmotivatie', 'leesattitude', 'nudges']"

How the feeling of psychological ownership influences willingness-to-accept (WTA) in anticommons dilemmas.,"Tosellini, Riccardo","['Kwaadsteniet, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The anticommons dilemma is not a well known dilemma, but wellworth studying as it has a practical impact on individuals and society when it occurs. It occurs when multiple people co-own a resource or property who have to grant each other permission in order to use or sell the resource. This study explores whether in an anticommons dilemma a participant’s feeling of ownership over a resource increases when he or she has to put effort into obtaining it. Half of the participants (Ntotal = 208) had to exert effort by doing an effort task in order to influence their Willingness To Accept (WTA) value, i.e. the amount of points they are willing to accept as payment in order to let the other co-owner use the resource. The participants also filled in a Psychological Ownership scale. Effort did not significantly influence psychological ownership, but psychological ownership did significantly influence WTA. There was no significant WTA difference between the (un)equal effort treatment conditions. The effects of effort are further analysed and discussed.","['anticommons dilemma', 'willingness-to-accept', 'effort', 'social dilemmas', 'psychological ownership', 'decision making', 'uncertainty', 'game theory']"
The use of a Dutch version of the Hinting Task as a measure of Theory of Mind in dementia populations: Master Thesis Clinical Neuropsychology,"Boersma, Hidde","['Houdt, A.C. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The Dutch Hinting Task measures the ability to understand indirect speech as part of Theory of Mind. Examined is the interitem reliability and its ability to differentiate between memory clinic patients (n = 22) from control participants (n = 24) and its ability to differentiate patients with a dementia diagnosis (n = 12) from patients without a dementia diagnosis (n = 10) at the memory clinic. Associations with other (social) cognitive functions were explored. Results showed that the Dutch Hinting Task has a low interitem reliability. The Dutch Hinting Task total scores differed between memory clinic patients and control participants and also between patient with and without a dementia diagnosis at the memory clinic. The Dutch Hinting Task total scores correlated significantly with emotion recognition, executive functioning and verbal category fluency, but not with verbal letter fluency. In conclusion, the Dutch Hinting Task needs increased reliability and further research with larger sample sizes in order to be used to investigate the understanding of indirect speech in dementia populations.","['(Theory of Mind', 'dementia', 'Hinting Task', 'social cognition)']"

Explained through anxiety: Anxiety mediating the association between sleep duration and suicidal ideation,"de Mol, Marjolein",['Liia Kivelä'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Background: Suicidal ideation (SI) has been linked to specific types of sleep problems, including short sleep duration. A previous study highlighted general anxiety as a mediator between short sleep and SI. The present study aimed to replicate these findings by examining the effect of short sleep duration on next-day SI and whether anxiety functioned as a mediator. Methods: The present study, consisting of eighty-two participants, was part of a longitudinal cohort study, with a 3-week daily assessment period with Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and actigraphy. Results: Multilevel regression analyses showed that there was a significant negative effect of sleep duration, and a positive effect of time spent awake during the night on next-day suicidal ideation. Anxiety mediated the relationship between objective- and subjective sleep duration, and the subjective time participants took to fall asleep and the time spent awake during the night, and suicidal ideation. Conclusions: Subjective short sleep duration lead to increased next-day SI, and spending more time awake during the night (both subjectively and objectively) also led to higher nextday suicidal ideation. Anxiety mediated the relationship between the subjective parameters for sleep duration, the time participants took to fall asleep, and the time participants spent awake during the night. When assessed objectively, only objective sleep duration was mediated by anxiety.","['anxiety, suicidal ideation, sleep duration']"
The relationship between child emotional maltreatment and current parenting behaviour: depression as explaining factor?,"Keijzer, Meryem","['Kullberg, M.L.J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Background: Emotional forms of child maltreatment (CEM), emotional abuse (EA) and emotional neglect (EN), are the most prevalent forms of child maltreatment which are associated with an increased risk of depression as well as maladaptive parenting. Objectives: The current study aimed to examine the association between CEM and specific maladaptive parenting behaviour, i.e. parental warmth and parental criticism, in daily life and the mediating role of parental depressive symptom levels in a sample of fathers and mothers from Dutch adolescents (N=151). Methods: Multilevel modeling was used to examine the association between parents’ level of CEM and their level of daily parental warmth and parental criticism. Next, a mediation analyses was performed using PROCESS macro to examine the mediating role of parental depressive symptom levels. Results: Results revealed that parents who experienced higher levels of CEM reported less daily parental warmth. Although CEM was associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms of the parent, depressive symptoms did not mediate the association between CEM and parental warmth in our study. In contrast to our expectations, the association between CEM and parental criticism was non-significant. Conclusion: Results of this study suggest that CEM is directly related with parental warmth but not with parental criticism in daily life and parental depressive symptoms did not mediate this relationship. However, parents in the current sample are, on average, considered healthy and live in favourable socioeconomic circumstances. Longitudinal research including parents with (sub)clinical mental health problems and less fortune living circumstances is needed to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between CEM and parenting behaviour.","['Child Emotional Maltreatment', 'Parental depressive symptoms', 'daily parenting behaviour']"

A feasibility study on applying the Montreal Cognitive Assessment for online videoconferencing to test cognition in Parkinson's disease Patients,"Dhoum, Dalila","['Weijer, R.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has become widely used as a brief test of cognitive function in patients with neurological disease. The aim of this study is to adapt the MoCA into a videoconference version (eMoCA) and test it for equivalence to the MoCA administered as part of usual care, i.e., face-to-face, for test-retest reliability in Parkinson patients and assess the practical implementation of the protocol for the videoconference version. To achieve this, we conducted a feasibility study to examine the feasibility of remotely administering the MoCA to individuals with Parkinson’s disease. The study involved 10 participants with Parkinson’s disease, who underwent in-person and remote assessments using video conferencing. To establish the reliability of the eMoCA the Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and the Cronbach’s Alpha were calculated. To see if the MoCA and the eMoCA are equivalent to each other, the equivalence test was performed. Feedback questionnaires were used to obtain feedback from the participants and the assessors on how they felt about experiencing the eMoCA. The ICC (2,1) was .87 ((95% CI: .53, .97); p = .002) and the Cronbach’s Alpha was .68. The results showed that administering the eMoCA to individuals with Parkinson’s disease was feasible, but that the reliability and the equivalence were not enough to speak of complete similarity. The major negative aspect for both the participants as the assessors were the technical issues making the appointments more complicated. Numerous participants indicated that not having to travel was a significant advantage. This study suggests that the MoCA could be used in remote assessments of patients and research participants with movement disorders, however there are still areas for improvement before the eMoCA can be applied in a clinical setting.","['Parkinson', 'MoCA', 'Videoconference', 'Online']"

A big group of children is structurally exposed to (severe) child abuse. Several risk factors can contribute to the development of child abuse within families. This study aims to investigate whether several aspects of parenting are able to predict the severity of child abuse within families. The sample consisted of 627 Dutch parents that have recently experienced child abuse within their family. The parents filled in self-report questionnaires about themselves, their children and their experiences with child abuse under the supervision of student-researchers. Topics covered in the questionnaire were, among others, the experience of child abuse within the family, the way situations were handled, the level of experienced parenting stress, the level of warmth and involvement shown to the child(ren) and the professional help that the family received. Results showed that the level of parenting stress that parents experience is a positive significant predictor of the severity of child abuse within families. The level of warmth and involvement that parents show towards their children appeared to be a negative significant predictor of the severity of child abuse. However, the level of parental warmth and involvement did not seem to play a significant role in the relationship between parenting stress and severity of child abuse. Gender of the parent was a nonsignificant predictor of the severity of child abuse and did not seem to play a significant role in the relationship between parenting stress and severity of child abuse. The results of the study show that parenting stress can be an important risk factor for severe child abuse, while parental warmth and involvement may be an important protective factor. It is important to take these aspects into account when offering professional help and in future research.","['child abuse', 'severity of child abuse', 'parenting', 'parenting stress', 'parental warmth and involvement', 'gender differences in child abuse', 'families']"

Motor sequence learning in patients with Alzheimer's Disease and its potential role as a new behavioral biomarker,"Heuser, Johan","['Ruitenberg, M.F.L.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract In the past, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a preceding state of AD, have mainly been linked to causing cognitive dysfunction. However, research is indicating that dysfunction is also present in other domains, such as motor functioning. The goal of this study is to analyze whether significant motor dysfunction, in the form of motor sequence learning, can be observed in an AD and/or aMCI population and whether motor dysfunction can be used as a behavioral biomarker for AD. This was done by evaluating associations between sequence learning indices and previously established biomarkers of AD, namely hippocampal volume and amount of amyloid-bèta plaques. These biomarkers were measured using a structural MRI and a PET scan respectively. Learning indices were derived for individuals with AD (n = 17), aMCI (n = 23) and healthy controls (n = 45), using a serial reaction time task (SRTT). The SRTT measured the participants’ reaction time and accuracy. The differences on these measurements between random and sequenced trials were used to calculate amount of learning (difference between the first and final trial) and rate of learning (overall increase between trials). Results from a MANOVA run with condition and the learning indices indicated no significant difference between the three groups. Results from multiple simple regression analyses to analyze whether the indices were correlated to bilateral hippocampal volume and amount of amyloid-bèta plaques showed no significant correlations. In conclusion, the study did not support using motor sequence learning tasks as a non-invasive biomarker for AD. Future studies should investigate the benefit of implementing relatively intact sequence learning abilities of AD and aMCI patients in rehabilitation programs, and the usability of other motor and learning functions as behavioral biomarkers, such as adaptability or gait. Layman's abstract Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory. Current biomarkers, which are signs to see if someone has AD, are often invasive and expensive. Finding a non-invasive biomarker would therefore be useful in early recognition of AD. We measured how quickly and accurately people with AD, aMCI and healthy controls responded to stimuli that were presented in either a fixed or a randomized order, using a serial reaction time task. From this, learning indices were calculated using statistical analyses, which were linked to already established biomarkers for AD. These biomarkers were the total volume of the hippocampus, a brain area related to memory, and the amount of amyloid-bèta plaques, which is an accumulation of proteins, often found in large quantities in the brain of someone with AD. Three conditions were used: a healthy control condition, an amnestic mild cognitive impairment condition, in which participants did not have AD but did show cognitive decline with memory problems, and an AD condition. Results showed no significant differences between the three groups on any of the learning indices. Furthermore, no significant link between the established biomarkers and the learning indices was found. As such, this study did not support the idea of using learning indices as new biomarkers for AD. Future studies should investigate if motor sequence learning can be used in rehabilitation programs for AD patients. Another point for future investigation is if other forms of learning, such as adaptability, or other forms of movement, such as gait, can be used as behavioral biomarkers.",
Does the Schoolyard Design Matter? Enjoyment and the Social Network of Autistic Children during Breaktime,"Wigman, Carina","['Rieffe, C.J.', 'Tsou, Y.T.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Being able to enjoy yourself in the schoolyard is very important. However, no research has been done on the experience of enjoyment in the schoolyard for autistic children. Furthermore, having social interactions is important in developing social skills and building friendships. It is known that autistic children experience difficulties in social interactions. Therefore, the present study investigated if the schoolyard design has an effect on the experience of enjoyment and the social network of autistic children (N = 42; 6–12 years old). The schoolyard of a special educational school was redesigned and a multidisciplinary collaboration was established to achieve this. Enjoyment was measured using the Lunchtime Enjoyment of Activity and Play Questionnaire (LEAP), which is a self-report questionnaire. The social network was mapped using Radio-Frequency Identification Devices (RFID), which tracked face-to-face contacts. Results showed no increase in enjoyment, nor a relationship between enjoyment and social network. However, the position in their social network improved after the schoolyard was redesigned. Autistic children had a better network centrality and longer durations of interactions with fewer interaction partners, indicating that they can more easily join a social activity and better sustain their interactions with peers in the new schoolyard. The outcomes of this study suggest that the schoolyard design, thus the environment, has an impact on the social interactions autistic children have. By adapting the environment to the needs of autistic children, social interactions and network centrality can improve, which could have positive outcomes for later life.",

In this study this is examined by looking at the relationship and if this is mediated by two separate factors. This study uses data from a Dutch sample of mothers and children who stay at a women’s shelter and all have suffered from interparental violence. The participants were twelve mother-child-dyads with a variety of nationalities. The mothers were between the ages of 26 and 48 years old (M = 32.75, SD = 6.02) and their children between the ages of 1 and 6 years old (M = 3.5, SD = 1.57). The current study uses the data from the first research-appointment, in which the mothers filled out some questionnaires about themselves and their children. The relationship between mothers’ childhood trauma and the behavioural problems of their child is examined while also exploring if this relationship is mediated. It is expected that this relationship is mediated by the presence of posttraumatic stress disorder-symptoms (PTSD) of mothers and by traumatic life events. The results show no significant relationship between mothers’ childhood trauma and the behavioural problems of their children. The mediation by traumatic life events is also not found in this study. At last, the relationship is also not mediated by PTSD-symptoms in this study. While this study doesn’t have any significant findings, the possible explanations and implications for further research and practise are discussed.","['Domestic violence', 'PTSD symptoms', 'traumatic life events', 'traumatic childhood experiences', 'behavioural problems']"

Knowledge about determinants of QoL is limited, especially from patients' own perspective. We examined whether there was a relationship between sex and QoL in patients in different stages and with different types of dementia taken together (total sample), whether this relationship existed within patient groups of specific stages or types of dementia separately and whether this relationship in the total sample was mediated by anxiety, depression, perceived severity, perceived susceptibility and/or coping style. Methods: In total, 375 patients aged between 32 and 82 years, who visited the memory clinic and who completed an 88-item self-reported questionnaire, were included in the study. Linear regressions were performed to assess the relationship between sex and QoL and whether stage and type of dementia affect this relationship. In addition, we performed mediation analyses to assess whether anxiety, depression, perceived severity, perceived susceptibility and/or coping styles mediate the relationship between sex and QoL. In all our analyses, age and education were added as covariates. We corrected for multiple testing using False Discovery Rate (FDR). Results: Sex was not associated with QoL (p = .160) in the total sample. Sex was also not associated with QoL within the different stages (CN p = .847, MCI p = .688 and dementia p = .688), or within different types of dementia (FTD p = .895, AD p = .809 and other types of dementia p = .895). Our mediation analyses showed that only anxiety was a significant mediator in the relationship between sex and QoL (p = .010). Conclusion: In our study, there was no relationship between sex and QoL. For patients trying to maintain or improve their QoL, it is important to be aware of the factors that play an important role in QoL.","['QoL', 'sex', 'dementia', 'stage', 'diagnosis', 'depression', 'perceived severity', 'perceived susceptibility', 'coping style', 'quality of life', 'anxiety']"

Cognitive reactivity as a predictor of first depression onset,"Herrmann, Louisa","['Van der Does, A.J.W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Previous research has shown that cognitive reactivity predicts first onsets of depression over a two-year period. Its predictive power over longer periods is unknown. Aim: To investigate the predictive power of cognitive reactivity on first depression onset over a span of six years. Secondly, to explore the possible moderating role of anxiety disorder diagnosis at baseline. Design and methods: In a longitudinal prospective design, 719 never-depressed individuals were observed over a span of two, four, and six years. Cognitive reactivity was measured using the Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity-Revised (LEIDS-R) (Van der Does & Williams, 2003) self-report scale. Using multivariate binary logistic regression, the prognostic value of the LEIDS-R scores for first depression onset were tested against several background variables and established risk factors of depression. Analyses were repeated in high- and low-risk groups. Results: The analyses of the whole sample and the lower risk sample showed that cognitive reactivity was associated with the incidence of first depression onset over a span of two- and six years. In the higher risk sample, cognitive reactivity was not a significant predictor for depression incidence over a span of two years, but it was over a span of six years. Conclusion: The outcomes of the present research suggest that cognitive reactivity is a strong predictor for first depression onset over a six-year period, both in high- and low-risk groups. These findings emphasize the need for further research on this relationship.","['cognitive reactivity', 'depression onset', 'cognitive theories']"
Effect van afgeleid eten op BMI: Resulaten van een moderatie analyse,"Kempenaar, Ilse",['A. F. van Meer'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In de afgelopen decennia is de prevalentie van overgewicht en obesitas toegenomen tot een wereldwijd gezondheidsprobleem. Om die reden is het belangrijk om onderzoek te doen naar de achterliggende redenen. Door de recente ontwikkelingen kunnen mensen altijd en overal eten en drinken terwijl ze zichzelf actief of passief bezighouden met andere activiteiten. Recent onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat regelmatig afgeleid eten kan leiden tot herhaaldelijke overconsumptie, wat kan leiden tot een verhoogd BMI. Een mogelijke oorzaak hiervoor is een beperkte ruimte in de werkgeheugencapaciteit. Een verminderde werkgeheugencapaciteit kan leiden tot het meer consumeren van voedsel, waardoor het werkgeheugencapaciteit effect zou kunnen hebben op BMI. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om het effect van werkgeheugencapaciteit op de relatie afgeleid eten en BMI te onderzoeken. Hiervoor is een moderatie regressieanalyse uitgevoerd. Een online vragenlijst is beantwoord door 135 deelnemers (16-59 jaar, gemiddelde leeftijd =25,61, 103 vrouwen, BMI 14,4-49,2). Er is gebruikt gemaakt van de Stroop taak als maat voor werkgeheugencapaciteit. De meeste gemelde afleidingen waren praten met anderen en smartphone gebruik. Er kon geen significante relatie tussen afgeleid eten en BMI worden aangetoond. Ook is er geen significant verband van de werkgeheugencapaciteit op de relatie afgeleid eten en BMI gevonden. Een reden voor het niet vinden van deze effecten kan het gevolg zijn van te weinig spreiding in de leeftijd van de deelnemers. Aangezien geraadpleegde literatuur het tegenovergestelde vond, is een vervolgonderzoek met een aangepaste methode belangrijk om de effecten van de werkgeheugencapaciteit op afgeleid eten te bepalen.",
Attitudes towards the use of warmth as strategic helping motive,"Rijsbergen, Rosalinde van",['Esther van Leeuwen'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This research builds on previous research by Horlings and Massaar (2020) and Luhulima and Bennema (2021). The aim of this study was to examine if there is a difference in how observers judge both the help provider and the help itself, depending on whether a motive to appear moral (morality) or a motive to appear social (sociability) was used. An experiment was conducted in which participants (N = 209) read a scenario about a group offering help based on the strategic motive to appear moral or social. Within this scenario it was manipulated whether the underlying motive for the help was in line with the actual traits of the help provider. The scenario was followed by a questionnaire. Results of this study showed that participants had a more positive attitude towards the help providers when they acted in line with their actual traits (reality congruence) compared to when they acted inconsistently with who they truly are (reality incongruence). Unexpectedly, no significant results were found that showed a difference in attitude towards the help provider depending on morality and sociability. Other results showed that help providers induced more negative attitudes when they behaved inconsistently with who they truly are, compared to when they behaved in line with their actual traits, because they were perceived as more hypocritical. Considering we were unable to find any significant results of the strategic use of warmth dimensions, more research on this topic is necessary.

Seventy-nine participants wore the placebo God Helmet for 45 minutes in sensory deprivation and were interviewed about their experience. A qualitative analysis showed that, although participants reported unusual experiences, these were distinct from their previous mystical experiences. Additionally, a permutation analysis revealed that participants rated the intensity of the God Helmet experience lower on average than their previous mystical experiences, suggesting that the God Helmet experiences are less intense. Nevertheless, the experiences induced by the God Helmet were reported as stronger than normal daydreaming and shared similarities with hypnagogic (falling asleep) states. In addition, a regression showed that individuals with more previous mystical experiences had more unusual experiences with the God Helmet and a higher Mysticism scale score, highlighting the importance of considering individual differences for understanding sensitivity to mystical-type experiences. Furthermore, as the God Helmet shows potential for inducing hypnagogic states within a 45-minute session, it has potential applications in sleep research and provides new avenues for investigating altered states of consciousness. However, as the God Helmet does not induce authentic mystical experiences with long-term positive effects, it is not an effective tool for investigating mystical experiences or applying them for therapeutic purposes.","['God Helmet', 'Persinger Helmet', 'mystical experiences', 'placebo brain stimulation', 'placebo', 'mysticism', 'sensory deprivation', 'hypnagogia', 'daydreaming']"
Prognostic uncertainties and patient involvement in modern medical drama series,"Zeeman, Amber","['van Vliet, L.M.', 'Kunneman, H.J.A.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: To assess clinicians’ expressions of prognostic uncertainty, how these expressions are related to participants’ characteristics, and patient involvement in medical drama series. Methods: In this empirical, non-interventional study, we observed consecutive simulated encounters between patients and clinicians in modern medical drama series (Grey’s Anatomy, The Good Doctor, New Amsterdam & The Resident). We coded encounters in duplicate using a self-developed coding scheme to code prognostic uncertainty and the validated OPTION-12 scale to code observed clinicians’ behavior of involving patients in medical decision making. We performed Chi-square tests of independence to measure the hypothesized links between participant characteristics and prognostic uncertainty. We explored the occurrence of MCF dimensions within expressions of prognostic uncertainty using frequencies. Results: We included 80 simulated encounters. Prognostic uncertainty was expressed in the minority of patient-clinician encounters (N=28, 35%). We found no relation between the discussion of prognostic uncertainty and patients’ gender, age and ICD classification. In addition, no relation between discussing of prognostic uncertainty and clinicians’ gender, age and function was found. Within expression of prognostic uncertainty, the presence of MCF dimensions related to the patient future and preference was higher than MCF dimensions associated with the process, such as manner of collaboration. OPTION-12 scores indicated a low degree of patient involvement in the decision making process (M = 19.69, SD = 9.94). Conclusions and implications: Modern medical drama series portrayal both accuracies and inaccuracies related to prognostic uncertainties and patient involvement. These portrayals can contribute to unrealistic expectations about roles of patient and clinicians and general views on care and treatments. For example, prognostic uncertainties were expressed in a minority of encounters, possibly contributing to the impression that medicine entails low levels of uncertainty in prognosis. In addition, the paternalistic communication approaches and over-presentation of certainty in these medical drama series may reduce patient involvement in real-life care and limit possible effects of interventions. Future research should focus on patients wishes in the communication of uncertainties in medicine. Educational and in practice implications consist of awareness on the effects of portrayals in medical drama series and certain conversational techniques, to ultimately increase shared decision making and make care fit.","['medical prognostic uncertainty', 'medical drama series', 'serious illness', 'patient involvement', 'shared decision making', 'making care fit', 'evidence-based medicine', 'patient and clinician characteristics', 'shared awareness', 'patient-clinician relationships', 'unknown future']"

"Playing the blame game: Accountability, blame management, and human rights in Frontex","Pearlstein, Arianna","['Heaphy, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Gradually, the authority and capability of IOs to undertake tasks that enhance the enjoyment of human rights have proliferated, but these growing capacities also expand the potential for rights to be violated. This has led to increasing efforts to hold IOs accountable for the consequences of their behavior. The costs for IOs of being accused of human rights violations in terms of punishment and lost legitimacy creates the incentive for them to avoid accountability. Yet how IOs avoid accountability for human rights violations has not been substantially studied. This thesis fills this gap by applying a theory of blame management to the context of Frontex, which in recent years has faced scrutiny for violating the non-refoulement rights of migrants at sea. In doing so this thesis challenges the popular understanding of IOs as institutions committed to the high road in global governance, particularly on matters of human rights. Through a single case study of Frontex this thesis scrutinizes and ultimately finds support for the argument that when put in the spotlight for alleged human rights violations, accountability and blame are avoided through denial, delay, diversion, and delegation rather than accepted.","['Accountability', 'blame management', 'Frontex', 'human rights', 'international organization', 'international organisation', 'EU', 'European Union']"
Self-efficacy as a proxy for childhood agency: The association between self-efficacy and social competence of children with transgressive and aggressive behavior problems,"Knijff, Claire",['Hanna Swaab'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Developmental Psychopathology in Education and Child Studies (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Children that show high levels of persistent aggressive and transgressive behavior have found to be at serious risk of exhibiting delinquent and criminal behavior during later adolescence and adulthood. However, a clear explanation of possible underlying neurocognitive mechanisms contributing to the increased risk of developing criminal behavior is lacking. Therefore, this thesis aims to contribute to, and encourage comprehensive and nuanced analysis of the issue of children at risk of later onset of criminal and delinquent behavior, and to offer insight into the most effective ways of promoting positive outcomes for both individual children and society. Specifically, in the current study self-efficacy served as a proxy for childhood agency, whereby the relation between self-efficacy, social competence, and the possible mediating role of Theory of Mind (ToM) was investigated. The data in this study was derived from a sample of 425 children, aged eight to twelve, from the Preventive Intervention Trajectory (PIT) project. Overall, the results of the present study did not offer substantiation for the proposed mediation model. In addition, the comparative analysis of self-efficacy based on gender revealed a relatively equal distribution and there was no significant difference in mean self-efficacy scores between boys and girls. Total IQ did however show significant relations, as it was associated with higher ToM scores and less social problems. This finding is consistent with previous studies and suggests that intelligence should be taken into consideration in research and intervention of children with transgressive and aggressive behavior problems. The results do not necessarily rule out the underlying influences of self-efficacy, ToM, and social problems on transgression and aggression. More research is necessary to confirm the results of this study an identify the underlying neurocognitive constituents of childhood agency.","['Self-efficacy, aggressive, transgressive, behavior, children, childhood agency']"
Borderless Intelligence for a Borderless Threat: Will Europol Change the European Security Architecture?,"Vergano, Caterina","['Akbik, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Over the past decade, Europol has increased its capability to become a hub for EU intelligence exchange. This was found in large part of its strategies, as intelligence sharing became a central tool in the fight against terrorism. In light of this entrepreneurship, the research seeks to explain whether Europol’s information exchange was able to advance more integration in the area of counterterrorism. Through the lens of historical institutionalism, this thesis investigates counterterrorism integration through the concept of path dependence; past actions can possess causal relevance for the future of an institution, changing its initial primacy, towards innovative change. The main hypothesis drawn from this is that Europol’s intelligence-sharing drove counterterrorism into a path-dependent trajectory of integration. Starting from the Madrid 2004 bombings, and ending with the Paris 2015 attacks, the research employs a process-tracing method to track the changes between the two terrorist attacks. It finds that counterterrorism proceeded through a pattern of increase, as Europol proactively expanded its powers to allow more cooperation in the EU and become a central hub for intelligence exchange for counterterrorism.",

Reading Between the Emotional Expressions: Uncovering the Role of Gender Difference and Depressive Symptoms in Facial Emotion Recognition (FER),"Shadaqa, Neil Ghany","['Kemala, C.N.', 'Jongsma, L.A.', 'Ghiță, I.A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a fundamental component of social interactions. The accuracy of FER is influenced by several individual differences such as gender and depressive symptoms. In terms of gender, previous studies have shown a female-advantage in the FER accuracy performance of both positive and negative emotions. Nevertheless, experiencing depressive symptoms may prompt a negative impact on FER accuracy, resulting in an emotion processing bias (e.g., happy facial expressions perceived as neutral). The purpose of this study was to determine the role of gender, depressive symptoms, and the presented types of emotion on FER accuracy. Methods: Young adults of European origin (N = 170; Female = 92) with and without depressive symptoms were asked to identify facial expressions and rate their intensity and emotional valence. The arcsine transformed unbiased (HuArc) hit rates were used to calculate accuracy scores for the main analysis, whereas valence and intensity ratings were included in the exploratory analyses. A mixed ANOVA was conducted for the main and exploratory analyses. Results: The main analyses indicated that there were no effects of both gender and depressive symptoms on FER accuracy performance across all emotion types. Furthermore, non-significant results of depressive symptoms were found in the exploratory analyses of valence and intensity ratings. However, a gender difference was found in the valence ratings where women rated happiness more positively and anger more negatively than men. While on the intensity ratings, women rated all types of emotion as more intense than men. Conclusion: This study found no evidence of a female-advantage in accuracy performance. Nevertheless, this study’s exploratory analyses indicated that women process emotions differently than men concerning emotional valence and intensity ratings. Furthermore, depressive symptoms had no effect on FER accuracy. In order to ascertain the generalizability of the findings, future research should explore the gender difference on emotional valence and intensity across various ethnic backgrounds. Additionally, investigating when the severity of depression will influence the FER performance.","['Facial Emotion Recognition, Female-Advantage, Gender Difference, Depressive Symptoms']"
Examining Psychological Characteristics as Treatment Attrition Moderators for CBT and ACT in a Population of Older Adults Suffering from Anxiety,"Fang, Bao","['Witlox, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Research identified psychological characteristics underlying a ‘need for psychological control’ as treatment attrition moderators for anxiety disorders in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). It has not yet been examined if these characteristics moderate treatment attrition for older adults with anxiety, as this age population experience greater barriers in seeking therapy. Objective: This study evaluated whether the psychological characteristics of experiential avoidance and cognitive reappraisal moderated the observed attrition in CBT, and if mindfulness and positive mental health moderated the observed attrition in ACT. Method: Dutch speaking adults, aged 55-75 (N=314) with mild to moderate anxiety, were randomized into a four session CBT or ACT protocol. In the primary analysis, treatment attrition was defined as attending at least one treatment session but not completing all four sessions. In the secondary analysis, treatment attendance was defined as the total number of completed treatment sessions Results: The observed attrition rates were significantly different between the CBT and ACT condition (ꭓ2=6.58, p=.01). The four psychological characteristics did not significantly predict treatment attrition nor the number of completed treatment sessions in CBT and ACT. Conclusions: This study found no moderation in the examined psychological characteristics on the observed ACT and CBT attrition for older adults with anxiety. These findings may be explained by age related reorientations in the need for control and methodological issues in defining treatment attrition. Methods for developing a multi-layered definition of treatment attrition are discussed, and future directions for treatment attrition moderator research are proposed.","['attrition', 'dropout', 'CBT', 'ACT', 'older adults', 'psychological characteristics']"

The sample consisted of ten participants (therapists), including three men and seven women, who were invited via a call on the LinkedIn accounts of the lead researchers and by asking three different youth care institutions to distribute the call to their therapists. The study consisted of a semi-structured online interview of 45 minutes to one hour. The participants were individually interviewed by a researcher. The interviews showed that therapists seem to agree on the importance of using evidence-based trauma treatments, such as EMDR and CBT, treating the entire family system or treating parents parallel with the victim and having expertise or being able to refer to colleagues with the right expertise. In addition, explicitly discussing the sibling sexual abuse, making sure the client feels heard and seen and creating a safe therapeutic atmosphere by the therapist were notable themes that recurred in the interviews.",
Your Phone Bill is not the only thing that makes your Phone expensive: How Distraction increases Online Consumption and decreases Satisfaction,"Spiessens, Nienke",['Anouk van der Weiden'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this paper, the correlation between distraction and consumption and the correlation between distraction and satisfaction were examined, through two different questionnaires. Both correlations were regarding online consumption. These correlations were examined because of prior research by Grewal, Ahlbom, Beitelspacher, Noble, & Nordfält (2018) and Van der Wal and van Dillen (2013). These studies both indicated that distraction could increase consumption, and the last study also found out that satisfaction could be a possible cause of this. For this paper, it was expected that distraction also leads to higher consumption in an online setting, and that higher distraction would lead to lower satisfaction. In the first questionnaire, distraction was measured through average daily screen time. The consumption was measured over one month, and three different variables were constructed. The first variable was the number of items bought, the second variable was the amount spent and the third variable was the average amount spent per item. The results showed that higher screen time leads to more items bought, but a lower average spent per item. The amount spent was not higher for higher screen time. In the second questionnaire, distraction and satisfaction were measured subjectively right after a purchase was made, in order to get an accurate picture of the level of distraction and satisfaction in that particular moment. Distraction and satisfaction were measured through different Likert scale items. This correlation was not significant. Making distraction in the second questionnaire an objective measure, could have the advantage of being more accurate. Overall, distraction does increase the number of cheap products bought.",

Associative learning: Examining the impact of Trauma and Social Contexts,"O' Hanrahan, Sadhbh Ms.","['Topel, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Associative learning underlies much of our everyday decision-making. Understanding the factors that impact associative learning abilities thus represents an important research aim. Childhood trauma has been shown to negatively impact associative learning, but little is known about the impact of trauma in adulthood in healthy populations, or the impact of combined childhood trauma and recent trauma. Recent research suggests that associative learning may also differ across social and non-social contexts. This study utilised a matched aversive learning task and a within-subjects design to examine the impact of self-reported childhood trauma, recent trauma, and combined childhood and recent trauma on associative learning in social and non-social contexts. 250 participants were recruited via Prolific; 192 (97 female) were included in analysis. This was a healthy community sample. Results revealed distinct contributions of self-reported childhood trauma, recent trauma, and combined childhood and recent trauma to poorer associative learning scores. Overall associative learning performance was similar across social and non-social contexts. Combined trauma impacted associative learning scores significantly more in the non-social than social condition. This suggests qualitative differences in the processes underlying associative learning across contexts, and may illustrate strengths in navigating social uncertainty that emerge in those who experience both childhood and recent trauma. This study illustrates the potential of traumatic exposures to affect associative learning across the lifespan, and that experiences of both childhood and recent trauma may be superadditive in their impact. Recommendations for future research and appropriate designs to overcome this study's limitations are outlined.","['learning', 'childhood trauma', 'recent trauma', 'social contexts', 'life course adversity']"
Physical and social critical incidents for police officers: differences and impact of stressfulness and frequency on well-being,"Baltjes, Noah",['Eliska Prochazkova'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This survey study was conducted to examine differences between physical and social critical incidents for police officers and their impact on police officers’ well-being. The Critical Incidents Survey for Police Officers was used to measure Incident Frequency, Stressfulness, Preparedness, and Need for More Training. The WHO-5 Well-Being Index was used to measure police officers’ well-being. Paired Samples T-tests were performed to examine differences between physical and social critical incidents. Simple linear regression analyses were performed to predict Incident Preparedness on Incident Stressfulness and Incident Stressfulness on Well-Being and Process Macro moderation analysis was used to test the moderation effect of Incident Frequency on the latter. A total of 52 police officers (Netherlands and UK) reported higher frequency and preparedness for social than physical critical incidents and higher stressfulness for physical than social critical incidents (p < .001). Incident Preparedness did not predict Incident Stressfulness, Incident Stressfulness predicted Well-being (b = -.04, p = .008) and Incident Frequency moderated latter relationship (b = - .00, p = .016). We showed that police officers deal more frequently with social than with physical critical incidents, experience more stress with physical than with social critical incidents, and feel less prepared for physical than for social critical incidents. Moreover, we showed that experiencing high amounts of stress caused by critical incidents decreases police officers’ well-being and that encountering critical incidents at high frequency enhances this effect. To enhance police officers’ well-being, critical incidents high in stressfulness and frequency should be defining factors for police training interventions.","['police officers, well-being, mental health, critical incidents, physical critical incidents, social critical incidents, incident frequency, incident stressfulness, incident preparedness']"

"The relationship between sleep, exercise, and cognitive performance in adolescents at high-risk for severe mental illness","Offers, Marise","['Cuperus, A.A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction: Offspring of parents with a mood disorder have a strong risk of developing a mood disorder and displaying cognitive deficits compared to healthy controls. Research shows positiveassociations between sleep and cognitive performance and exercise and cognitive performance in the general population. The present cross-sectional study aimed to identify a relationship between sleep, exercise and cognitive performance in adolescents at high-risk for severe mental illness. It was expected that regular exercise or adequate sleep duration has a significant and positive association with cognitiveperformance in adolescents at high-risk for severe mental illness. Methods: Data were collected by the Mood and Resilience in Offspring (MARIO) study, a longitudinal study investigating the transmission of mood disorders between parents and offspring. In total, 146 participants from both a high-risk and control group were included and filled in questionnaires about sleep, exercise and depressive symptoms. They also completed two subtests (matrix reasoning and vocabulary) of the WISC-V or WAIS-IV. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to test whether there was a positive relationship between exercise, sleep and cognitive performance in adolescents at high-risk for severe mental illness and controls. Results: The analyses showed no significant association between exercise and matrix reasoning (β = -.02, p = .873) and vocabulary (β = .21, p = .146). Moreover, there was no significant association between sleep duration and matrix reasoning (β = -.06, p = .506) or vocabulary (β = -.07, p = .465). Furthermore, depressive symptoms did not moderate the relationship between sleep, exercise and cognitive performance. Sensitivity analyses, including only high-risk participants, did not reveal any additional insights. Conclusions: Contrary to the hypotheses, our findings show no positive association between adequate sleep duration and/or regular exercise and cognitive performance in adolescents at high-risk for severe mental illness. Offspring of parents with a mood disorder form a vulnerable group. Future research is therefore needed to better understand mood symptoms and cognitive deficits in offspring of parents with mood disorders.

Stakholderviews on facilitators and barriers in eHealth interventions for individuals with low SEP: A Delphi study,"van Os, Karin",['Isra Al-Dhahir'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Low socioeconomic position (SEP) individuals are more likely to develop chronic illnesses and to have poorer health outcomes than the general population. One promising approach to reduce this incidence rate of chronical illnesses is through eHealth interventions. Even so, the uptake of eHealth amongst low SEP individuals is low, and there is a lack of understanding how to best connect eHealth interventions to low SEP individuals. This study therefore aimed to gain insights into the main barriers and facilitators in eHealth for low SEP individuals, by consulting stakeholders (i.e., health professionals and policy makers). In addition, the present study was interested in possible differences between health professionals and policy makers. To assess these research questions, an online Delphi study was conducted. The present study analyzed the ratings of 12 Dutch stakeholders regarding 86 statements on barriers and facilitators in different phases of eHealth (i.e., development, reach, evaluation and implementation). Moreover, a Mann Whitney U test was conducted to assess possible differences in the ratings between health professionals and policy makers. Results revealed that time and financial resources as well as the eHealth intervention content and the involvement of low SEP individuals are key factors in eHealth for low SEP individuals. Additional main factors included the involvement of the social environment of low SEP individuals and the involvement of professionals. Finally, it was found that the employment of continuous evaluation cycles throughout all phases forms a major factor in eHealth for low SEP individuals. Additionally, the results indicated that one statement regarding the importance of user privacy in the development phase received a significantly higher score from policy makers than health professionals. No additional significant differences in scores between health professionals and policy makers were found. This study provides an overview of key barriers in eHealth for low SEP individuals. Understanding these barriers and facilitators may generate insights on how to optimize eHealth interventions for people with a low SEP, and therefore help professionals to connect eHealth to low SEP individuals. Furthermore, the present study could be considered as a building block on which future studies can be conducted.","['chronic illnesses', 'low socioeconomic status', 'eHealth interventions', 'stakeholders', 'delphi study']"

Children with Sex Chromosome Trisomies (SCT) have an abnormal number of X or Y chromosomes and may therefore be at risk for developmental problems, including internalizing problems. The present study aims to provide an answer to the question whether children aged 1 to 6 years with SCT have more internalizing symptoms than children without SCT, whether there is a difference between SCT karyotypes (XXX, XXY or XYY) and to what extent internalizing symptoms increase with age. This study included 29 children with XXX, 43 children with XXY, 20 children with XYY and 42 boys and 46 girls without SCT, all between the age of 1 to 6. These children’s parents completed the CBCL1-5 and a background-questionnaire while the WIPPSI-III was administered to the children. The study showed that children with SCT have an increased amount of internalizing symptoms compared to the control group. It also appears that there is a difference between the three SCT groups in degree of difference with the control group on internalizing symptoms. Finally, internalizing symptoms of children with SCT appear to have a stronger increase with age than the control group. In all three outcomes, it was also found that there is a difference between the SCT groups and between the SCT group and control group in which types of internalizing symptoms emerge. Thus, this study has shown that it is important to be aware of internalizing symptoms in young children, so that further development of these problems can be prevented. It is also important to keep in mind that internalizing problems manifest differently in these children, which makes it important to find a fitting intervention.","['Sex chromosome trisomies', 'XXX', 'XXY', 'XYY', 'internalizing problems', 'Klinefelter syndrome', 'Trisomie X syndrome']"
Beats That Ring a Bell: An Investigation on the Effects of Alpha & Delta Binaural Beats on Episodic Memory Consolidation.,"Dyrvold, Therese","['David Vogelsang, Samarth Varma']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Neural oscillations are known to underlie the dynamic neural processes related to episodic memory. On the one hand, low-frequency delta waves have been seen to facilitate memory consolidation, while higher frequency alpha waves are associated with more engagement in autobiographical thinking (ABT) which interrupts consolidation. Neural oscillations can be modulated via rhythmic auditory stimulation, also known as binaural beats (BB). Several studies have found that BBs have potential for enhancing cognitive functioning, such as attention and working memory. However, little is known about the efficacy of BB entrainment with regard to episodic memory. In this study, we investigated the effects of listening to alpha (9Hz) and delta (0.5 Hz) BB on episodic memory performance in an old/new recognition task in a within-subjects design. Thirty-six participants underwent three rounds of encoding, each followed by an 8-minute delay during which they listened to either alpha, delta or control BB soundtrack, ending with a recognition test. During BB stimulation, participants also reported the frequency and intensity of ABT. Results showed that listening to alpha and delta BBs did not significantly alter subsequent memory performance, nor did it affect ABT. Additionally, no correlations were found between ABT and memory scores. We discuss limitations to our methods and offer ideas for future research.","['episodic memory, neural oscillations, entrainment, binaural beats, autobiographical thinking, mind wandering']"
Predictors of stigmatizing attitudes of the general population towards people with health conditions,"Bossink, Fabienne","['van Beugen, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background Stigmatization can cause psychological problems and is commonly experienced by patients with chronic illnesses such as Parkinson’s disease and psoriasis. Little research about stigmatization towards health conditions and their predictors in the general population has been conducted. Objectives This study aimed to investigate the levels of stigmatizing attitudes towards individuals with psoriasis, Parkinson's disease, and a common cold in comparison to healthy individuals. Additionally, the study aimed to identify potential predictors of stigmatizing attitudes, including gender, familiarity with the health condition, and perceived vulnerability to disease. Methods After showing 4 vignettes describing encounters with people with health conditions (Parkinson’s disease, psoriasis, common cold and healthy individual), questionnaires were administered to 164 participants in a cross-sectional 4 x 1 within subjects design. A one-way repeated measures MANOVA, multiple regression analyses and univariate regression analyses were performed including 5 questionnaires measuring stigmatizing attitudes as outcomes and gender, familiarity and perceived vulnerability to disease as predictor variables. Results The study found a significant difference in the level of stigmatizing attitudes between the four conditions F (27, 1292) = 42.2, p < .001; Wilk’s Λ = .16, partial η2 = .46, with descriptively higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes in all health conditions when compared to the healthy control condition. In the Parkinson condition, women showed a significantly higher level of stigmatizing attitudes than men, and PVD was a significant predictor towards conditions which were perceived as contagious (psoriasis and common cold), which is in line with the behavioral immune system theory. In the psoriasis condition, higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes were predicted by greater familiarity. Conclusion This study provided insight into the extent of stigmatizing attitudes towards individuals with health conditions in the general population. The findings could be useful in defining target groups for stigmatization-reducing interventions, and could help develop these interventions, such as education and awareness campaigns or especially tailored interventions for men and women. Future research is recommended.","['stigmatizing attitudes', 'general population', 'Parkinson', 'psoriasis', 'predictors']"

Previous research showed that one-year PTSD, major depressive disorder (MDD), comorbid PTSD-MDD symptom severity and new traumatic events are associated with long-term PTSD symptom severity. These different factors are often not included in research together and there are large differences in follow-up duration and study populations. The determination of predictors of PTSD is a prerequisite for efficient service delivery and prevention. Therefore, this study investigated the predictive value of 1-year PTSD, MDD, comorbid PTSD-MDD symptom severity and new traumatic events on 15-year PTSD symptom severity after traumatic injury. This study is a sub-project of Trauma TIPS, a prospective longitudinal cohort study. In this study n = 315 participants completed the online self-report questionnaires Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Life Events Checklist for the DSM-5 (LEC-5). A multiple hierarchical regression analysis showed that higher 1-year PTSD, MDD and comorbid PTSD- MDD symptom severity significantly predicted higher 15-year PTSD symptom severity, unlike new traumatic events. These findings allow interventions to be developed to avert individual risk and may allow people with potential risk factors to be better monitored and treated in the future. This study partly replicated findings and revealed contradictions with previous research. Future research could focus on understanding the mechanism behind the association between 1-year PTSD, MDD and comorbid PTSD-MDD symptom severity and long-term PTSD symptom severity.","['PTSD, MDD, comorbidity, traumatic injury, subsequent traumatic exposure']"

Negative experiences and attitudes shape our present-day behaviour. Research identifies empathy and attitude as precursors to mimicry. Pupil mimicry can indicate trust and bonding in human-human interactions, as the pupil provides a look into people’s mental state or intentions. It is unclear whether pupil mimicry in human-human interactions extends to other species. This research investigates how factors such as, negative experience and attitude, can change pupil mimicry responses with conspecifics (humans) and cross-species (bonobos and dogs). Using a Repeated-measures ANOVA, the effect of Species (human, bonobo or dog) and Pupil action (dilating or constricting) on pupil mimicry was investigated. This analysis found that while the interaction was not significant, the main effects of Species and Pupil action were. Secondly, the impact of negative experiences with dogs on pupil mimicry with only dog stimuli was investigated using an ANOVA, this was not significant. Lastly, an ANCOVA was conducted, using Species and Pupil action, with Attitude as a covariate, on pupil mimicry. The results of this analysis were insignificant for both interaction and main effects. The current study was unable to find evidence of negative experience or attitude influencing pupil mimicry cross-species. Areas for improvement on the study design include a more in-depth analysis of the non- human stimuli prior to data collection and pre-conceived biases towards dog breeds used in the experiment. Additionally, more information on context and severity of negative experiences with dogs would be beneficial to future research.","['Pupil mimicry', 'Negative experience', 'Dogs', 'Attitude']"

These impairments differ from person to person, as autism concerns a spectrum of symptoms. As metacognition (the ability to monitor and control one’s own thought processes) is said to be related to executive functioning and social cognition, impairments in metacognition might explain difficulties in daily functioning of autistic children. Therefore, the relationship between metacognition, emotion recognition and the quality of children with ASD-symptoms was examined. Method: 25 boys and 21 girls between the age of 8-16 (M = 10) from primary- and secondary schools in and around Leiden participated by performing the Thinking Aloud- task (metacognition) and Morphed Face Emotion Recognition Task, as well as completing the Cantril ladder (quality of life. One parent of each participant completed the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 to measure ASD-symptoms. Results: ASD-symptoms did not significantly correlate to metacognition (F(1.39) = 1.911, p = .175, R² = .047). Furthermore, metacognitive skills did not significantly predict emotion recognition skills (,F(1.41) = .073, p = .789, R² = .002). Neither metacognition nor emotion recognition was a significant predictor of the quality of life of children (F(2.40) = .683, p = .511, R² = .033). Conclusion: Due to the small sample, the current findings should be interpreted carefully. However, this study underscores the importance of examining the individual strengths and needs of children to promote their personal development and well-being. Future research within a larger sample should further investigate the role of metacognition in relation to the well-being of children in different contexts to better support pupils according to their neurocognitive strengths and weaknesses. This might not only contribute to the well-being of the individual child, but might also be beneficial for society as a whole.","['Metacognition', 'emotion recognition', 'quality of life', 'well-being', 'autism', 'children']"
"Symptom Structures of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder and Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder","Glock, Phoebe","['Veenman, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Individuals from communities characterized by high crime rates, violence, poverty, and social disadvantages are of greater risk to develop PTSD. Due to high comorbidity rates between PTSD and borderline personality disorder (BPD), recently, complex PTSD was introduced. Complex PTSD contains, next to PTSD symptoms, the additional symptoms as disturbances in self-organization (DSO) and negative alterations in cognitions and mood (NACM). However, it remains unclear how symptoms of complex PTSD, PTSD, and BPD are related in an at-risk, urban sample. The present study explored the relations between PTSD, BPD, DSO symptoms and NACMs using a network approach. The symptoms were assessed using semi-structured clinical interviews. Participants (N = 470; 98.1% female; 97.7% African-American) were recruited by Powers et al. (2022) from medical clinics within urban areas in the USA. Two network analysis were estimated using EBICglasso model to create regularized partial correlation networks. The first to explore the overall structure of PTSD, BPD, and complex PTSD, the second to investigate the relatedness of the NACM and DSO symptoms. The results were in line with previous studies and indicated that the NACM symptoms play a crucial role in the PTSD structure, in connecting PTSD with the DSOs. BPD and DSO symptoms were related via emotional dysregulation. Of the specific NACM symptoms, trauma-related amnesia was more related to BPD than to PTSD, and DSO symptom. This suggests BPD and PTSD to be distinct, complex PTSD to be phenomenologically related to both and the NACM and DSO symptoms to be associated with each other.","['PTSD', 'Borderline', 'complex PTSD', 'African-American', 'Network Analysis']"
Exploring the relation between maternal depression and anxiety and child pupil responses to dynamic facial displays of emotion,"Sabino da Costa, Inês Alexandra I.A.","['Aktar, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Observing emotions in others’ facial expressions is an important factor guiding social interaction. Observing others’ emotions elicits physiological arousal in the observer, which is reflected in increased pupil diameter (i.e., pupil dilation). The current study used pupil dilation as an index of physiological arousal to explore children’s responses to emotional facial expressions. More specifically, we investigated whether maternal symptoms of depression and/or anxiety were related to offspring’s pupil responses to negative (versus positive) facial displays irrespective of the child’s symptomology. A community sample of 87 mother- (M = 42.30, SD = 5.60, range = 27-57) child (M = 10.11, SD = 1.32, range = 7.2-12.9) dyads participated in the current study. Mothers and offspring reported on their depressive and anxiety symptoms via self-report questionnaires. Children’s pupil responses to angry, fearful, sad, and happy dynamic facial displays were measured during the dynamic emotions task using eye-tracking. Results revealed that maternal depressive symptoms were not related to child pupil responses to negative (versus positive) faces. Higher levels of maternal anxiety, however, were linked to stronger child pupil responses to fearful and sad faces than to happy faces. In turn, child pupil responses to angry (versus happy) faces did not statistically differ as a function of maternal anxiety. These findings persisted after accounting for the link between child anxiety symptoms and child pupil responses. Therefore, the way typically developing children react to negative versus positive emotional faces in later childhood appears to be related to maternal levels of anxiety, but not to maternal levels of depression. This points to the importance of exploring maternal anxiety symptoms as a potential risk factor for the development of negativity biases in offspring across the general population.","['School-aged children', 'Mothers', 'Offspring', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'Pupillometry', 'Pupil dilation', 'Negative emotional faces', 'Positive emotional faces', 'Dynamic stimuli', 'Emotional facial expressions']"
Personality disorders and stigma,"Dullaart, Julia","['Blom, J.D.', 'Slotema, C.W.', 'Hofman, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Patients with a personality disorder may experience stigmatization, sometimes even on a daily basis. However, research suggests that not everyone with a personality disorder experiences it in the same way, and that the extent to which it is internalized is also different for different persons, depending on a number of possible variables. The aim of the current study is to investigate the role of some of these variables, i.e. that of the type of personality disorder and age. It also examines whether the age at which patients have first been diagnosed might influence the extent to which they internalize stigmatization. In total, 36 participants from two specialized outpatient clinics filled out four questionnaires on stigma, in a cross-sectional comparative study design. The results show that neither the type of personality disorder nor age play a role, and that the age at which someone receives a diagnosis of personality disorder does not predict whether stigma will be internalized. Although the present study has its limitations, such as a modest representation of the target group and low statistical power, it is of value because it focuses on the patients’ perspective and paves the way for further research on this topic.","['Personality disorder', 'personality disorders', 'stigma', 'stigma experiences', 'stigma internalization', 'self-stigma', 'cluster', 'personality disorder cluster', 'age', 'age at first diagnosis']"
Gut feelings: The Relationship between Gut Microbiota and Cognitive Reactivity: The moderating effect of enterotype,"Grol, Eva","['Steenbergen, L']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Recent evidence indicates that the gut-brain axis plays a role in mental well-being, with microbiota as a crucial component. Yet, it is still unclear how it influences cognitive reactivity, known as a predictor of depression. Understanding how the microbiota-gut-brain axis affects cognitive reactivity may contribute to enhancing interventions targeting cognitive reactivity and eventually depression. Objective: The current observational study investigated the association between cognitive reactivity and Alpha diversity in the gut microbiota, and the moderating role of enterotype among (self-reported) healthy Dutch adults (N = 75, M age = 24.04, SD = 3.43). Methods: The gut microbial composition and enterotype were based on a 16S rRNA analysis, after which the Shannon index was calculated to indicate Alpha diversity. Based on literature, enterotype was categorized into three groups: Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus. The LEIDS-r was used to measure cognitive reactivity. A simple linear regression and moderation analysis using Hayes PROCESS were performed. Results: The moderation analysis revealed a significant moderation effect; however, the overall model was not significant therefore the results should be interpreted carefully. The results demonstrated an association between gut microbiome diversity (Shannon index) and cognitive reactivity among participants in the Bacteroides dominant group and the Ruminococcus dominant group, whereas no such correlation was found among participants in the Prevotella dominant group. Discussion: The current findings suggest an enterotype-dependent link between gut microbiota diversity and cognitive reactivity in healthy adults, which may provide a new perspective for the development and deployment of therapeutic gut microbial interventions targeting cognitive reactivity and ultimately depression","['Gut microbiota', 'Microbial Alpha diversity', 'Enterotype', 'Cognitive reactivity', 'Depression']"
Impact of COVID-19 social distancing measures on mental health care treatment outcomes for common mental disorders in the Netherlands: Videoconferencing therapy vs in-person interventions,"Podgorski, Alicja","['de Beurs, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In March 2020, the Dutch government began implementing measures to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and to reduce the burden to the national healthcare system. Historically, Dutch mental healthcare has been slow to implement and utilise digital interventions, however, the new public health policies regarding social distancing presented an acute and emergent need to do so. Despite therapists’ concerns regarding its efficacy and potential technical challenges, countless mental healthcare professionals turned to videoconference therapy to conduct generalistic Basic Mental Healthcare outpatient treatments. This paradigm shift presented a rare opportunity to examine whether videoconferencing therapy yields comparable results to in-person interventions for common mental health disorders. Arkin, a large mental healthcare facility and research institute in central Amsterdam, collects routine outcome monitoring data for patients under its care, to support shared decision-making. For the purposes of this study, basic mental healthcare patients (N = 1392) were divided into three cohorts: Treatments performed prior to, treatments performed partially during, and treatments performed entirely during the COVID-19 lockdown; and pre- and post-test data were used to compare outcomes. Across the three cohort conditions, there were no differences in the treatment outcomes for videoconferencing therapy conducted during lockdowns, as compared to in-person interventions done prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, or blended treatments that had commenced as in-person treatment before the pandemic and then transitioned to videoconferencing during the lockdown. This observational study seems to indicate that videoconferencing and in-person therapies can produce similar clinical results in Basic Mental Healthcare patients with common mental health disorders, bolstering the findings of other meta-analyses and randomized controlled studies investigating this topic.","['COVID-19', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'effectiveness', 'videoconferencing treatment']"

Clear Your Mind Through Exercise? A Lab Study Investigating the Effect of Exercise on Emotion Regulation,"Garbrecht, Claudia","['de Vries, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Despite a strong theoretical background suggesting that physical exercise reduces negative emotions, methodological shortcomings produced inconsistent evidence for this relationship. Studies indicate adaptive cognitive emotion regulation (ER) as a mediator in this relationship and suggest that trait emotional intelligence (EI) may moderate the relationship between exercise and adaptive cognitive ER. Aim: While improving methodological shortcomings, this experiment aimed to clarify and extend previous research investigating the exercise-negative emotions relationship. To allow for stronger causal conclusions, this study was the first to explore adaptive cognitive ER as a mechanism. As another theoretical extension, it examined whether trait emotional intelligence strengthens the relationship between exercise and adaptive cognitive ER. Method: 103 participants completed a measure of negative emotions and trait EI before recalling a negative personal event to induce negative emotions. After indicating their negative emotions again, they were randomly allocated to one of three conditions: An experimental condition in which participants exercised by cycling at a moderate intensity, an attentional control condition in which participants completed a puzzle and a no-attention control condition in which participants relaxed. While completing their respective task, participants were instructed to reflect on their negative personal event. After task completion, negative emotions and adaptive cognitive ER were assessed. Results: Contrary to expectations, a one-way ANCOVA showed that negative emotions were not lower after exercising compared to puzzling or relaxation. An exploratory analysis revealed that all participants, regardless of their condition, experienced less negative emotions from before to after exercise, puzzling or relaxing. However, PROCESS showed partial support for an indirect effect: Compared to participants who puzzled, those who exercised engaged in more adaptive cognitive ER and consequently experienced less negative emotions. Finally, trait EI did not strengthen the relationship between exercise and adaptive cognitive ER. Conclusion: Exercise reduces negative emotions as well as puzzling and relaxation. This effect may be due to mechanisms not assessed in this study. However, this study provides preliminary evidence that exercise indirectly lowers negative emotions via adaptive cognitive ER. Future studies are needed to clarify the potential of exercise to reduce negative emotions by employing larger and more diverse samples, such as clinical samples, as well as including other – theoretically sound – underlying mechanisms. Practically, this study suggests that different strategies effectively reduce negative emotions, regardless of how emotionally intelligent individuals are.","['Physical exercise', 'negative emotions', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional intelligence']"

"The Effect of Culture in Treatment of PTSD, Depression and Anxiety-Disorders in Refugees: A Meta-Analysis","Roozendaal, Tim",['Marc Molendijk'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The number of people in the world that are refugees is ever increasing, and because of this the mental problems associated with refugee status is an ever increasingly important problem. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate whether similarity in culture between a refugee’s country of origin and country of residence could predict the treatment related progression of their symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety. Distance between countries was taken as a moderating variable to separate similarity of culture from other, correlated considerations, such as the duration of the journey. Through (multivariate) regression analysis it was found that when this distance was controlled for, similarity of culture was associated with improved treatment of PTSD and anxiety. This means that although on average symptoms were significantly reduced by treatment (Cohen’s d = -0.77 for PTSD, -0.68 for depression, -0.54 for anxiety), this was in large part moderated by the similarity of culture, with PTSD treatment efficacy being up to about one standard deviation greater for the most culturally similar countries than for the least. For anxiety this difference was about half a standard deviation, and although no significant results were found for depression, the data did point in the same direction. Furthermore, a subgroup analysis showed that this effect could fully be mitigated by adapting the treatment to the language and culture of the refugee. These result show that it is likely that dissimilarity of culture has a detrimental effect on treatment efficacy. They show as well the importance of adapting treatment to the language and culture of the refugee, especially when their culture is very dissimilar to that of the country of their arrival.","['Meta-Analysis, PTSD, Depression, Anxiety, Refugee, Culture']"
The role of preoperative anxiety in the patient's preference between general anesthesia and spinal anesthesia after patient education,"Nguyen, Danielle","['Veldhuijzen, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background Preoperative anxiety (prevalent in 60-80% in adult patients) describes an unpleasant state of tension resulting from a patient's doubts or fears before surgery, and may play an important role in one’s anesthetic preference, as anesthesia seemed to be the main cause of preoperative anxiety (62%) rather than the surgery (15%). Preoperative anxiety was associated with increased complications during the preoperative and postoperative period, thus implies the importance of reducing this anxiety while examining anesthetic choice. Aim To examine the role of preoperative anxiety (in the form of fear of needles, fear of pain and fear of losing control) in a patient’s preference in anesthetic choice between general (GA) or spinal anesthesia (SA), after the patient is adequately educated on the risks and benefits of both techniques. Hypotheses included that if the patient has a higher fear of needles, a higher fear of pain, an external health locus of control (HLC) or a high degree of trust in physicians, the patient will prefer GA over SA. Method This prospective exploratory study examined fear of needles, fear of pain and fear of losing control using several questionnaires: Injection Phobia Scale-Short Form (IPS-SF), Fear of Pain Questionnaire-9 (FPQ-9), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLC) and Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS). Patients of preoperative anesthesiology outpatient clinic (N = 484) of Albert Sweitzer participated and twelve binary logistic regression analyses were executed. Results 68.8% of participants preferred GA over SA. IPS-SF (OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.96, p<0.001), FPQ-9 (OR 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.98), p=0.006), and physician scale of MHLC (OR 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.98), p=0.007) reported to be statistically significant associated with anesthesia. Discussion Fear of needles, fear of pain and trust in physicians played a significant role in a patient’s anesthetic preference. Suggestions for future research include reassessment of the used information videos, specify study inclusion to those who could choose their anesthetic and inclusion of detailed information of a patient’s previous anesthetic experience. This study also highlighted the importance of health care professionals and their efforts to reassure the patient in minimizing preoperative anxiety on an educational level and implementing interventions specifically aimed at fear of needles and fear of pain.",

"Extraversion, neuroticism, social anxiety, emotion regulation and sex as possible risk factors for experiencing peer victimization in adolescence","Appels, Nené",['Dr. E. Schreuders'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Research shows that peer victimization is a major and common problem in adolescence. Changes are also taking place socially, emotionally, and personally during this period, where some studies found associations between extraversion and neuroticism regarding peer victimization and suggest links between social anxiety and emotion regulation regarding peer victimization. With this study, I investigated whether sex, extraversion, neuroticism, social anxiety, and emotion regulation are significant predictors of the experience of peer victimization and whether there is a significant interaction effect between extraversion and social anxiety (1) and neuroticism and emotion regulation (2). Boys were expected to experience more peer victimization than girls. It was also hypothesized that extraversion and emotion regulation were significant negative predictors, and neuroticism and social anxiety were positive predictors for experienced peer victimization. Data came from self-reports of 87 adolescents from 13.75 to 16.42 years of age (M = 14.9, SD = .51). Results showed that higher levels of social anxiety are associated with more experienced peer victimization, as expected. In addition, higher levels of extraversion were associated with more experienced peer victimization, which was not in line with expectations. Speculatively, this could be explained by the distinction between assertive and dominance constructs versus being approachable and easygoing regarding extraversion. No evidence was found for sex, neuroticism, emotion regulation, the interaction between extraversion and social anxiety, and the interaction between neuroticism and emotion regulation as predictors of experienced peer victimization. This study provides evidence that higher levels of extraversion and, separately, higher levels of social anxiety are associated with greater experiences of peer victimization in adolescence, with implications and thoughts for future research.","['peer victimization, adolescence, extraversion, neuroticism, personality']"
Onderzoek naar de invloed van PTSS op delinquent gedrag van Nederlandse jongeren die kindermishandeling hebben meegemaakt,"Knops, Anna","['Oudega MPhil, M.H.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"A Dutch study indicated that young people who experienced child abuse exhibit significantly more violent delinquent behavior, and that this did not decline over time. This can have harmful consequences for both the individual and society. Child abuse has been identified as a cause of risk factors of delinquent behavior, possibly due to the disruption of social, emotional, and cognitive development. Recent literature suggests that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may play a role in the link between child abuse and delinquent behavior. This study aims to investigate whether PTSD moderates the relationship between the seriousness of delinquent behavior and severity of exposure to child abuse in the same sample as the Dutch study. Surveys were conducted among 127 Dutch youths aged 12 to 20 years who have experienced physical and emotional abuse. The severity of child maltreatment is measured using the Child Parent Conflict Tactics Scale (CPCTS) around the time of the official CPS report. PTSD and delinquent behavior are measured 1,5 years later, using the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) and the International Self Report Delinquency (ISRD). The results show no significant relationship between the severity of child maltreatment and the seriousness of delinquent behavior, nor identifies any direct or moderating effect of PTSD on delinquent behavior in maltreated youth. However, gender and age are significantly related to the seriousness of delinquent behavior, implying older teenagers and males have a higher likelihood of showing delinquent behavior to a more serious extent. This study finds no relationship between the severity of child maltreatment, PTSD, and the seriousness of juvenile delinquency. Other factors than child maltreatment or PTSD may play a role in predicting delinquent behavior, such as the youth’s social environment. Professionals should focus on identifying and addressing the various factors that influence youth’s behavior.","['child maltreatment', 'youth delinquency', 'PTSD']"

ICF not only aims at reducing emissions, but mostly focuses on reducing the vulnerability of populations in developing states, through financial transfers from the Global North to the Global South. Climate justice movements insist on bottom-up policymaking, whereby power is handed back to non-state actors (NSAs) from the Global South. While the role of NSAs in international climate policies has been researched, their role in the specific finance programmes has been largely overlooked up until now. This paper therefore tries to contribute to the field through researching what role NSAs play in the design, implementation and evaluation of ICF programmes. This is done on the basis of content analysis of four of the United Nation’s climate financing programmes as part of its Green Climate Fund (GCF). This research concludes that the role of communities is only limited in the design and implementation stage, but much more present in the evaluation stage. The projects still have a very top-down focus and the involvement of the communities is hampered because of cultural and practical reasons. Strict objectives help to formalise the involvement of communities. While models of democratic pluralism and functionalism are already in place, a neocorporatist model could help the GCF to overcome difficulties in involving NSAs and to make their policies more effective and legitimate.","['climate justice', 'international climate finance', 'non-state actors', 'Green Climate Fund', 'communities', 'democratic pluralism', 'neocorporatism', 'functionalism']"

Hoewel in de literatuur steeds meer bekend is over de consequenties van affectieve polarisatie, is er weinig bekend over hoe affectieve polarisatie tot stand komt. In deze studie stellen wij voor dat affectieve polarisatie ontstaat doordat mensen morele overtuigingen vormen over bepaalde onderwerpen. Morele overtuigingen zijn attitudes die gefundeerd zijn in iemands overtuigingen over wat goed en fout is en wat moreel of immoreel is. Door middel van een survey onderzoekt de huidige studie de relatie tussen morele overtuigingen en affectieve polarisatie met betrekking tot twee actuele thema’s in Nederland: coronavaccinaties en klimaatverandering. Daarnaast wordt het moderatie-effect van sociale media gebruik op deze relatie onderzocht. De analyse laat zien dat respondenten meer affectieve polarisatie vertonen bij een sterkere morele overtuiging voor het thema coronavaccinaties, maar niet voor klimaatverandering. Daarnaast tonen de resultaten dat sociale media gebruik wel een moderator is bij klimaatverandering, maar niet voor coronavaccinaties.

Avoidance behavior as a mediating factor in the relationship between Intolerance of Uncertainty and PTSD symptoms in a non-clinical sample,"Visser, Emise",['Marike Kooistra'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop in individuals after exposure to traumatic events. Exposure to at least one traumatic event is high throughout the entire population (80.7%). Evidence suggests that intolerance of uncertainty (IU) plays an important role in the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms. However, there are mixed results regarding the two dimensions of IU, prospective IU (P-IU) and inhibitory IU (I-IU), that related differently to PTSD symptoms. Moreover, relationships between IU and avoidance behavior, and avoidance behavior and PTSD symptoms have been shown. Objective. Our study aimed to assess whether IU is associated with PTSD symptoms, whether P-IU or I-IU seemed to be more strongly related to PTSD symptoms, and whether avoidance behavior mediates this relationship between IU and PTSD symptoms. Methods. Participants from our non-clinical, trauma-exposed, sample (N = 133) were administered the Life Events Checklist for the DSM-5 (LEC-5), PTSD checklist for the DSM-5 (PCL-5), Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale – Short Form (IUS-12), and Posttraumatic Avoidance Behavior Questionnaire (PABQ). Results. Results of regression analysis showed that IUS-12 scores were moderately correlated with PCL-5 scores, and that I-IU, and not P-IU, was a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms. Results of simple mediation analysis showed a significant effect of IU on PTSD symptoms through avoidance behavior. Conclusion. IU is positively associated with PTSD symptoms, and I-IU, and not P-IU, is significantly associated with PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, avoidance behavior partially mediated the relationship between IU and PTSD symptoms. More research is needed to replicate and extend our findings.","['Negative/traumatic life events, intolerance of uncertainty, Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, avoidance behavior']"

Effect van een preventieve maatwerkbehandeling op internaliserend en externaliserend probleemgedrag bij jongens en meisjes met een hoog risico op crimineel gedrag,"Abrahams, Élise","['Jonge, M.V. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"A decrease in juvenile delinquency over the past years triggers questions about the effectivity of current preventive interventions. Past research shows that behavioural factors form risks to a different extent in girls as they do in boys. For primary-school aged girls, internalising problems form a risk of delinquency in adolescence, whereas for primary-school aged boys, externalising problems are a greater risk for adolescent delinquent behaviours. In this study, the effectivity of a Dutch preventive intervention is examined, namely the preventive intervention trajectory (PIT). In particular, changes in internalising and externalising problems after following the PIT at primary-school age are compared between two genders, namely male and female. Results show significant decreases in internalising and externalising problems for all children. A mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows that the decreases for both internalising and externalising problems do not differ for boys and girls. On the one hand, it can be argued that this is the desirable outcome, since the decrease of both types of problem behaviour are fairly divided between boys and girls. On the other hand, the PIT could learn from current research to focus more on the internalising problems in girls and more on the externalising problems in boys to effectively decrease the risk on juvenile delinquency at a later age. Furthermore, on average the externalising scores remain clinical for the whole sample, which could indicate room for improvement for the PIT concerning decreasing the externalising problems even more, especially in boys. These clinical remaining scores could, however, also be explained by the fact that some participants’ trajectories may not yet have been completed. In conclusion, this research adds to the awareness of gender responsive prevention in juvenile delinquency.",
Autistic features in Angelman Syndrome: A Longitudinal Analysis of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale,"Lens, Eline","['Weng, L']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurogenetic disorder characterized by, severe developmental delays, little to no speech development, seizures, gross and fine motor deficits, stereotypical behavior, and anxiety. There are four genetic subtypes of AS: deletion, UBE3A mutation, Paternal Uniparental Disomy (UPD), and Imprinting Defect (ID). Former research showed that there is a high comorbidity between AS and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, little is known about how autism symptoms develop over time in AS. This study aimed to investigate how the severity of autism symptoms develop over time for the total group of AS children, per genetic subtype, and per gender. The sample consists of 41 children with AS who were tested two to four times at the center of expertise in Rotterdam. The ages ranged between 2.7 and 18.6 years, and the average time between the first and last test date was 4.2 years. The severity of autism symptoms was measured with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS). The course of autism symptoms over time was analyzed with a linear mixed effects model in R. Results indicated that the severity of symptoms does not change over time (p = .220). In addition, it was found that children with a deletion presented with more autism symptoms on baseline compared to the other genetic subtypes (for all comparisons the p-value was < .001). Longitudinally, we found that children with a deletion develop differently from children with UPD regarding the severity of autism symptoms (p = .012). Children with a deletion stay stable in the severity of autism symptoms over time whereas children with UPD decrease in the severity of autism symptoms. For gender, we found that boys present with more autism symptoms at baseline than girls (p = .046). Longitudinally, no differences were found in how boys and girls develop regarding the severity of autism symptoms (p = .356). This study was the very first to investigate how autism symptoms per genetic subtype and per gender develop over time in children with AS. The results will help to inform the clinicians and caregivers about the prognosis of autism symptoms in Angelman Syndrome.","['Angelman syndrome', 'autism, ASD, autism spectrum disorder']"

The manipulations (experimental design) did not seem successful, but we still found negatively correlational evidence that various forms of intergroup threat were negatively related to the purchase intention of products from China. Surprisingly, we found that threats from China also led to fewer US buying intentions. In addition, we found that negative emotions and consumer ethnocentrism mediated the effects of purchase intentions toward China. The implications for work on intergroup threat and consumer behaviour are discussed, together with the practical implications for international and domestic marketing.

Hoogerwerf']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating and pervasive disorder involving persistent preoccupations with intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and ritualized actions or behaviors (compulsions). Investigating the mechanisms underlying the development, maintenance, and treatment outcome can increase our understanding of the heterogeneity of the OCD population. One factor that may affect OCD symptom severity is self-efficacy, which is the belief in one’s capacity to perform necessary behaviors for goal attainment. Another potential factor is experiential avoidance, the avoidance of negatively perceived inner experiences including thoughts, emotions, memories, or physical sensations. This cross-sectional study is embedded in the 3D (Doorbreek Dwang Digitaal) study, which is a randomized controlled trial investigating the treatment effects of treatment for OCD by comparing exposure as usual and a personalized online approach to this therapy. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between baseline levels of self-efficacy, experiential avoidance, and OCD symptom severity in patients with OCD. Methods: To this end, the baseline questionnaires of self-efficacy (the Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for OCD; SEQ-OCD) and experiential avoidance (the Avoidance and Acceptance Questionnaire; AAQ-II), and a structured interview for OCD symptom severity (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; Y-BOCS) were used. A multiple linear regression model tested the relationship between baseline scores on the SEQ-OCD, AAQ-II, and Y-BOCS of 40 participants diagnosed with OCD. Consecutively, a hierarchical and a k-means clustering analysis were performed, to form clusters of participants using the SEQ-OCD, AAQ-II, and Y-BOCS baseline scores. Results: Results showed that self-efficacy had a significant negative relationship with OCD symptom severity, as higher levels of self-efficacy were associated with a lower level of OCD symptom severity. However, this relationship was not significant anymore when experiential avoidance was added to the model. Experiential avoidance was not significantly related to OCD symptom severity or self-efficacy. With hierarchical and k-means clustering, two clusters were identified that significantly differed in levels of self-efficacy, OCD symptom severity, and experiential avoidance. One cluster showed significantly higher levels of OCD symptom severity and experiential avoidance and significantly lower levels of self-efficacy. This cluster also experienced more obsessions involving contamination, religion, symmetry/ordering, and more compulsions involving cleaning and counting. Conclusion: This study indicates that there is a relationship between self-efficacy and OCD symptom severity. Moreover, we found evidence of distinct groups of OCD patients with different levels of self-efficacy, OCD symptom severity, experiential avoidance, and different OCD symptom subtypes. This may indicate a differential role of self-efficacy and experiential avoidance across the different OCD symptom subtypes. Limitations of this study included the small sample size and the overrepresentation of females and the contamination obsession subtype. Future studies using larger sample sizes and a more diverse sample are required to further establish the precise mechanism of self-efficacy and symptom subtype in the development and maintenance of OCD.","['Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Self-efficacy', 'Experiential Avoidance', 'Psychological Flexibility', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Symptom Severity', 'Y-BOCS', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Symptom Dimensions', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Subtypes']"
"eHealth Interventions for People with Low Socioeconomic Position (SEP): Cardiac Rehabilitation Attendance, Digital Literacy, and eHealth Preferences","Urbanaviciute, Rasa","['Al-Dhahir, I.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: People with low socioeconomic position (SEP) have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), however they attend and benefit from cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs less than the people with high SEP. eHealth can facilitate healthcare management, yet individuals with low SEP lack access or digital skills to use eHealth tools. Our aim was to examine the relationship between SEP and CR attendance and test whether digital competence mediates the association between SEP and eHealth preferences. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted with 812 Dutch adults from various CR clinics in the Netherlands. Eligibility criteria was being 18 years old or older and having a basic knowledge of English and Dutch. CR attendance was measured by the number of attended physiotherapy sessions. SEP was determined by the highest attained educational level which participants indicated in an online questionnaire. The digital competence and eHealth preferences were also collected via the same questionnaire. One-way ANOVA was used to test the association between SEP and CR attendance, Kruskall-Wallis test and logistic regression analysis were used to test the mediation models with digital competence as the mediator between SEP and eHealth preferences. Results: We found no statistically significant differences among SEP groups in their CR attendance. Additionally, none of our mediation models were significant. Nonetheless, the low SEP group had a significantly lower digital competence score compared to both middle and high SEP groups, 2 (2, N = 463) = 82.23 p < .001. Low SEP individuals also preferred eHealth guidance by friends and family more often than the individuals with high SEP, b = -1.64, SE = .68, p = .02. Conclusions: The efforts to incorporate eHealth into cardiac healthcare programs should consider socioeconomic differences in digital skills and differential eHealth guidance preferences. Easy-to-use eHealth tools and the involvement of patient’s social circle might be a helpful approach when designing cardiac treatment programs for people with low SEP. Future studies should further explore the eHealth preferences of different groups and search for strategies to address the digital divide.","['Cardiovascular disease', 'cardiac rehabilitation', 'socioeconomic position', 'eHealth', 'digital skills', 'digital literacy']"

We also examine whether specific groups of bystanders influence this behaviour. Thee hypotheses were formed: first, ostracism leads to less green consumption when no bystanders are present. Second, the presence of pro-environmental bystanders will lead to more green consumption, meanwhile the presence of anti-environmental bystanders will lead to less green consumption. Third, the influence of the bystanders on green consumption will be largest for ostracized individuals and smallest for over-included individuals. After a game of Cyberball to manipulate the level of inclusion, participants would choose a pro-environmental or conventional product. However, none of our hypotheses yielded significant results. Further research can focus more on the difference in gender eco-gap and the prices of the pro-environmental products in order to further battle a the current climate crisis.","['Green Consumption', 'Ostracism', 'Bystander Identity', 'Basic Social Needs']"
De rol van psychopathologie in de intergenerationele overdracht van de verschillende vormen van kindermishandeling.,"Beekman, Birgit","['Jonge, M.V. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Tens of thousands of children have to deal with some form of child abuse on a daily basis in The Netherlands alone. Studies have shown that experiencing child maltreatment enhances the chance of maltreating your own child as a future parent. This study examines this so-called intergenerational transmission of child maltreatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between the different subtypes of child maltreatment (abuse and neglect), to find out if the experienced type of maltreatment during childhood could be a predictor for the type of perpetrated maltreatment of their own children as parents. Furthermore, this study examined the role of psychopathology as a possible mediator between experienced and perpetrated child maltreatment. Participants were families with at least three generations, with a minimum age of seven and a half. The information was obtained using questionnaires and the data was analyzed through multiple regressions and mediation analysis. Results show that the subtype of experienced maltreatment was indeed a predictor for the perpetrated subtype of maltreatment. This means that parents who have suffered neglect in their own youth, were more likely to neglect their own children as parents and parents who have suffered abuse were more likely to abuse their own children. No evidence was found for psychopathology to mediate the relation between the types of experienced and perpetrated maltreatment. However, follow-up research is needed to gather more information on the exact role of psychopathology.","['Kindermishandeling', 'intergenerationele overdracht']"
"The role of focused attention on visual memory for objects in a crime scene, in the Implicit Memory Method for Criminal Investigation (IMMCI)","Bes, Heleen",['Fenna Poletiek'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Due to an increase in cybercrime, new methods for proving a suspect’s guilt are needed. One potential new method is the Implicit Memory Method for Criminal Investigation (IMMCI), that aims at eliciting unique crime scene knowledge from suspects. This method relies on different patterns of source monitoring between guilty and innocent suspects. The current study aims at testing the validity of this method, and in particular tests the effect of focused attention on source memory performance. Participants were divided in a guilty or innocent suspect condition, with either focused attention or no-attention instructions. The guilty suspects were first exposed to pictures of a cybercrime scene (CS) at T1, and a slightly manipulated version of this cybercrime scene (CSm) at T2. The innocent suspects were exposed to a control set of stimuli (trees) at T1, and the same CSm as the guilty suspects at T2. At T1, half of the participants received instructions for focused attention on the images, while the other half did not. During the test session (T3), item recognition and source memory was measured. Results indicate that guilty suspects had a lower source memory accuracy than innocent suspects, while visual recognition memory was high and equal between both. Moreover, this study found that source memory accuracy has a relatively good predictive ability to discriminate guilty from innocent suspects. Besides that, no main effect of attention was found. To conclude, this study suggests that the IMMCI might be a useful method for distinguishing between guilty and innocent suspects.","['IMMCI', 'Source memory', 'Recognition memory', 'Focused attention']"

The Reciprocal Relationship Between Smoking-Related Self-Identities and Intention to Quit,"Kernbach, Pia-Eileen",['Kristell Penfornis'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Rationale: Smoking-related self-identities (perceptions of oneself) can directly influence quit-intention, as posited by PRIME Theory of Motivation by Robert West, through an evaluation of ourselves. The outcome of how pleased or distressed we are with ourselves motivates us to create plans (set intentions) to change our behaviour to eliminate possible distress. Therefore, intention plays a mediating role between self-identity and behaviour. Objective: This study aims to corroborate earlier findings that smoker self-identity is negatively associated while quitter- and non-smoker self-identity are positively associated with quit-intention. Further, the study assessed if quit-intention reversely is negatively associated with smoker- and positively related with quitter- and non-smoker self-identity. By that, we assessed a possible reciprocal relationship between quit-intention and three smoking-related self-identities. Smoking-related self-identities and quit-intention may therefore be valuable components of interventions, especially, a possible reciprocal relationship which would allow targeting both components simultaneously. Methods: The current research project employed an observational online cross-sectional design including measures of 238 Dutch and Belgian adult smokers from 2017/18 who reported an intention to quit. Participants came from low, medium, and high SEP backgrounds, had smoked between half a year and 65 years, and had attempted to quit up to 50 times. Primary outcomes were quit-intention as well as smoker-, quitter-, and non-smoker self-identity. Results: Regressions showed that stronger quit-intention was associated with a weaker smoker self-identity and a stronger quitter- and non-smoker self-identity. Reciprocally, stronger smoker self-identity was associated with a weaker while non-smoker self-identity was associated with a stronger quit-intention. No relation between quitter self-identity and quit-intention was found. Overall, non-smoker self-identity had the strongest association with quit-intention as well as, reciprocally, quit-intention was associated with the strongest relationship with non-smoker self-identity. Conclusion: The observed reciprocal relationship shows that quit-intention as well as smoker-related self-identities, especially non-smoker self-identity, can be used to influence each other to increase the chances of successfully completing smoking cessation interventions. These interventions could target both ends, self-identity (e.g., by using future-self tasks) and intention (e.g., by using intention-setting techniques). The interventions would then not only strengthen self-identity and quit-intention directly but also indirectly through each other.","['smoking, self-identity, intention to quit']"
Eye-tracking as an Outcome Measure of Social Functioning in Children with Angelman Syndrome: A Feasibility Study,"Berg, Louise van den",['Dr. Anne Cuperus'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurogenetic disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, little or no speech development, and movement problems. Currently, there is a lack of suitable outcome measures to assess autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children with AS, and the prevalence of ASD in AS is debated. This study aims to contribute to the development of better outcome measures by investigating the feasibility of a social eye-tracking task in children with AS. We hypothesize that 1) eye-tracking is feasible in children with AS; 2) the severity of the disability of the child can predict the feasibility; 3) children with AS show a preference for faces similar to neurotypical children, and; 4) autism symptoms correlate significantly with eye movement behavior towards faces. Methods: Data from an observational cross-sectional study of 23 children with AS was analyzed. Children were presented with an eye-tracking task that included six slides, each containing a picture of a face and four other non-social stimuli. We considered the task feasible if 1) 70% completed the task and 2) 60% of those who completed the task contributed to data of acceptable quality. Autism symptoms were measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS-2). Results: 52.17% of participants completed the pop-out task and 80% of those provided evaluable eye-tracking data. The main reason for unsuccessful measurements was failed calibration. A logistic LASSO regression revealed that severity of disability was not a predictor of feasibility. One sample t-tests showed that participants directed their first looks more often towards faces than would be expected by chance, t(5) = 5.64, p =.002. This effect is also seen in neurotypical children. Results on whether children’s attention is also maintained on faces are mixed. Eye-movement behavior towards faces was not significantly correlated with ADOS-2 scores. Conclusion: According to our criteria, the task is not feasible since less than 70% completed it. However, in our sample, we observed that once calibration is successful, most participants completed the task and had data of acceptable quality. Therefore, we believe that eye-tracking can be a feasible measuring instrument if a better calibration method is found.",
Examining the Impact of Peer-Support Group Sessions for Women who Have Experienced Domestic Violence and/or Childhood Abuse,"IJzerman, Eline","['Tollenaar, M.S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Violence against women is a persistent problem with deleterious consequences, such as the onset and maintenance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is still little evidence-based research done on the effects of peer support for people with symptoms of PTSD that have experienced domestic violence. Consequently, it is of great clinical interest to investigate if peer support groups are beneficial for this subgroup. This study investigated whether peer support groups are an effective treatment for reducing PTSD symptoms by increasing hopefulness among women who have experienced abuse. Thirteen female participants (Mage = 37.54 years at baseline) attended ten sessions of peer support groups led by an experience expert and completed questionnaires at a pre-measurement and a post-measurement. The methods used in this study were the Life Events Checklist, PTSD checklist for DSM-5, adult hope scale, and childhood trauma questionnaire. We found a reduction in the severity of PTSD symptoms (for intrusion symptoms and negative changes in cognitions and mood) and an increase in hopefulness after participation in the peer support sessions. This increase was seen for both participants' goal orientation and their ability to make plans to achieve their goals. Although we expected a relationship between PTSD symptomology and hopefulness, this was not found. The findings from this study suggest that peer support groups may be a beneficial addition for women with PTSD symptoms who are not in treatment (yet) or have tried established PTSD treatment.","['intimate partner violence', 'peer support', 'domestic violence', 'hope', 'posttraumatic stress disorder']"
Measuring Vulnerability to Depression Relapse: A Meta-Analysis of the LEIDS(-R) in Comparison to the Golden Standard of Cognitive Reactivity Measurement,"Braam, Laura","['Does, A.J.W van der']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Vulnerability to depression can be indicated by cognitive reactivity (CR), which is the ease with which depressive thoughts are (re-)activated in people who are not currently depressed (Solis et al., 2017). The golden standard to measure CR as the change in dysfunctional cognition scores before and after mood induction, is the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS). However, the use of mood induction and the administration of the DAS are not always reliable (Martin, 1990; Gillies & Dozois, 2021; Solis et al., 2017). The LEIDS(-R) questionnaire was developed to measure CR without the need of mood induction. The aim of this study is to compare both questionnaires on the basis of a meta-analysis. The following main question is formulated: Is the LEIDS(-R) a more accurate index of depression vulnerability compared to the DAS? To answer this question, a Bayesian meta-analysis was done in JASP. A systematic literature search resulted in fourteen articles that made use of the LEIDS(-R) and DAS and compared CR scores for previously depressed and never depressed groups. We found that the LEIDS(-R) has a significantly larger effect size than the DAS difference score in the distinction between vulnerable (previously depressed) and non-vulnerable (never-depressed) groups. This indicates that the LEIDS(-R) is more reliable in the measurement of vulnerability to depression relapse. However, it is advised that more research is done on the concept of CR and its measurement, to ensure that differences between the DAS and LEIDS(-R) are not due to measuring a slightly different concept.","['depression relapse', 'cognitive reactivity', 'dysfunctional attitudes scale', 'mood inductions', 'Leiden index of depression sensitivity']"

Substance Use and Executive Functioning in Adults Diagnosed with a Psychotic Disorder: No Mediating Role of Sleep Quality,"Prins, Kimberly","['Ruitenberg, M.F.L.', 'Van Aken, B.C.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Impairments in cognition are considered as one of the core features of psychotic disorders, including impairments in executive functioning (EF). EF is an umbrella term that incorporates several higher cognitive functions. Findings on the relationship between substance use and EF are inconsistent. A potential mechanism underlying the effect of substance use on EF may be sleep disturbance. Therefore, the aim of this thesis study was to identify the relationship between substance use and EF in people diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and examine whether sleep quality mediates this relationship. Methods: The current sample comprised 301 participants with a primary diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. Schizophrenia was the most common diagnosis in the sample (43.2%). EF was assessed using the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function for Adults (BRIEF-A). Substance use was assessed using the Measurements in the Addictions for Triage and Evaluation questionnaire (MATE). Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: Results of a linear regression analysis showed a significant positive relationship between the MATE and BRIEF-A (β = .25, p < .001). The mediation analysis confirmed this significant positive relationship between the MATE and the BRIEF, by a significant total effect (β = .25, p = .001). The indirect effect of the MATE on the PSQI was not significant (β = -.0004, p = .996). The indirect effect of the PSQI on the BRIEF-A was significant (β = .22, p = .002). The direct effect of the MATE on the BRIEF-A was significant as well (β = .25, p < .001). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that more problematic substance use is associated with worse EF. This relationship is not mediated by sleep quality in our study, as substance use was not found to be associated with sleep quality. However, we found that better sleep quality was associated with better EF. These results highlight the importance of taking substance use and poorer sleep quality into account in the treatment of psychotic disorders.","['psychotic disorders', 'executive functioning', 'substance use', 'sleep quality']"

The prevalence has doubled between 1990 and 2016 to 43.8 million people. Pain, discomfort and lack of stimulation are the most common unmet needs in people with dementia. Namaste Care, a multisensory intervention, has been shown to be somewhat effective in addressing these needs. Evidence for Namaste Care effectiveness is inconclusive and there is a need for more randomized controlled trials with large sample sizes to further solidify the evidence base for the workings and effectiveness of this intervention . This study aims to further establish the if the Namaste Care Family programme, an adapted version of Namaste Care, is capable of addressing these unmet needs. Method 19 nursing homes participated in this study, resulting in 231 participants separated into the control and intervention condition. Measurements took place from baseline, through 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. Observations were carried out by trained researchers using the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD), the Discomfort Scale-Dementia or Alzheimer Type (DSDAT) and through observing frequency of positive vocalizations, which is an important dimension of being stimulated (engagement). Results The Namaste Care Family programme led to higher frequencies of positive vocalizations over time (F(2.771, 322.266) = 4.608 , p = .005). Discomfort scores at 6 and 12 months follow-up were significantly lower than those of controls (t(58) = 2.926, p = .005 and t(31) = 3.338, p = .002). This effect on discomfort seemed to translate to daily life as there was no significant difference in discomfort scores between Namaste sessions and daily life. There was a dose-response relationship between pain and Namaste dosage. Pain scores were significantly lower at 12 months follow-up as frequency and duration of attended Namaste Care Family sessions increased (F(1, 51) = 7.088 p = 0.01). Discussion and conclusion This large scale randomized controlled trial suggests that the Namaste Care Family programme could be an effective intervention component in providing stimulation, pain and discomfort management.","['Namaste Care Family Program', 'unmet needs', 'pain', 'discomfort', 'lack of stimulation', 'people with dementia', 'intervention', 'large scale cluster randomized controlled trial']"

Various attempts have been made to combat the disease, but none have succeeded. To understand why this is the case, it is essential to research what political factors can contribute to eradicating malaria. Previous research has claimed that democracy has a positive influence on health outcomes. Nevertheless, very little is known about the causality between democracy and its influence on malaria. This thesis aims to close this gap by answering the following research question: Are democracies better at handling malaria than non-democracies? Several linear regressions are done to test different democratic mechanisms, following the electoral accountability-, public goods- and political trust theory. The overall research findings show a positive but small and insignificant effect on the influence of democracy on malaria. Thus, this thesis does not provide evidence that suggests that democracies are better at handling malaria compared to non-democracies.","['Malaria', 'sub-Saharan Africa', 'Public Health', 'Democracy', 'Electoral accountability theory', 'Public goods theory', 'Public trust theory']"
The Influence of Substance Abuse on the Association Between Functional and Personal Recovery in Psychotic Disorders,"Broer, Marit M. I.","['Hanneke Hulst', 'Ruth Rietveld']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The definition of recovery in psychotic disorders is shifting from just the alleviation of symptoms to a more multidimensional approach where in addition to clinical recovery, personal, societal, and functional recovery also play an important role. Even though much research has been done to investigate the different dimensions and possible confounders, mediators, and moderators, the concept is still very new and so more research is needed before treatment can be innovated. This paper investigated the question: is there an association between functional and personal recovery? Personal recovery is the subjective road to recovery, which includes concept like connectedness, hope and optimism, identity, meaning in life, and empowerment. Functional recovery revolves around the compensation for the loss of skills due to illness. In addition, we investigated the question: do substance abuse and substance dependency have an influence on the association between functional and personal recovery. People with a psychotic disorder have a higher chance of becoming substance abusers or substance dependent and thus this is an important factor to investigate that could influence recovery. We investigated these two questions by interviewing patients with a psychotic disorder. We used three validated questionnaires to measure the dependent, independent, and mediating variable, which are personal recovery, functional recovery, and substance abuse/dependency respectively. We found an association between functional and personal recovery (p < .001). A mediating effect of substance abuse and substance dependency on the association between functional and personal recovery was not found. Our results are in line with previous research that has also found associations between functional and personal recovery, adding to the evidence that the dimensions in the multidimensional approach are related concepts. A possible reason for the absence of a mediating effect of substance abuse and substance dependency on the association between functional and personal recovery could be that drug use alone might not influence recovery, but when including more possible mediators, for example homelessness, substance use might significantly influence recovery. Future research should investigate a possible causal relationship between functional and personal recovery, and the possible mediating effects of drug use in combination with other mediators.","['functional recovery, personal recovery, psychotic disorder, drug abuse, drug dependency']"
The Effect of Training Dataset Size on the Quality of MRI Site Harmonization,"Heuvel, Liam van den","['De Vos, F.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Most neuroimaging studies are affected by small sample sizes and poor reproducibility of research findings. Therefore, aggregating data from multiple research centres is crucial to the development of the neuroimaging field. For this reason, MRI site harmonization is essential, as it allows for comparison and joint analysis of MRI data from multiple studies. MRI site harmonization aims to remove inter-site variability, while maintaining variance of interest. However, neuroimaging studies generally have low numbers of subjects to estimate the harmonization model. This paper examines the effect of dataset size on the quality of MRI site harmonization, and whether this effect is dependent on age differences between sites and the size of site differences. In order to evaluate the quality of MRI site harmonization we calculated the extent to which the correlation between GMD and age was recovered. To answer our research questions, we studied the performance of MRI site harmonization using a variety of training dataset sizes in an empirical study. Our empirical study shows no clear effect of the size of the training dataset. In addition, we studied the performance of MRI site harmonization in a simulation study, where we varied the number of subjects in the training dataset, the age differences between the centres, and the size of the centre effects. Our simulation study shows that the effect of training dataset size is minimal. The effect is only present when sites differ largely in mean age and when site effects are small. Thus, in all other conditions, inter-site variability is successfully removed, while variance of interest is preserved. This leads us to the conclusion that the limited effect of training dataset size suggests that prospects for the quality of harmonization in multi-centre studies with small datasets are promising.","['Harmonization', 'ComBat']"

M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"In deze masterthesis is onderzoek gedaan naar welke relatie er bestaat tussen adaptieve vaardigheden en kwaliteit van bestaan, bij mensen met een intensieve zorgvraag en persisterend probleemgedrag. Kwaliteit van bestaan is een begrip waarmee gemeten kan worden hoe iemand zijn leven ervaart. Adaptieve vaardigheden zijn nodig om je als individu zijnde staande te houden in het leven en mee te bewegen in de dynamiek van alledag. Het doel is te onderzoeken hoe deze vaardigheden zich verhouden tot de kwaliteit van bestaan. Het onderzoek is onderdeel van een longitudinale studie en uitgevoerd onder cliënten woonachtig binnen verschillende gehandicaptenzorgorganisaties. Er is bij alle cliënten sprake van een intensieve zorgvraag en/of persisterend probleemgedrag. De data is verworden door middel van het afnemen van vragenlijsten over de cliënten, bij begeleiders en/of nauw betrokken anderen. Uit het onderzoek is naar voren gekomen dat er over tijd een vooruitgang wordt gezien op adaptieve vaardigheden. Echter wanneer er onderscheid wordt gemaakt in een hoge en lage ontwikkelingsleeftijd, wordt gezien dat enkel de groep met een hoge ontwikkelingsleeftijd vooruit gaat. De andere groep stagneert over tijd. Voor beide groepen wordt over tijd wel een vooruitgang op kwaliteit van bestaan gemeten. Adaptieve vaardigheden blijken tot slot een voorspeller voor kwaliteit van bestaan. Dit geldt voor de gehele onderzoeksgroep, waarbij een vooruitgang op adaptieve vaardigheden zorgt voor een vooruitgang op kwaliteit van bestaan. Deze verworven resultaten en inzichten leiden ertoe dat de ondersteuning gericht op toename van kwaliteit van bestaan, nog beter ingericht kan worden om dit doel te behalen.","['Verstandelijke beperking', 'adaptieve vaardigheden', 'kwaliteit van bestaan']"
Mistakes that harm others: A neurocognitive investigation of social performance monitoring and psychopathic traits,"Goetzke, Eva","['Jansen, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Psychopathic traits are associated with reduced empathy, lack of concern for others and a tendency for externalisation of blame, which are important motivating factors for monitoring our own actions with negative consequences for others. Those with high levels of psychopathic traits may therefore engage in reduced performance monitoring in a social responsibility context than those with low levels. To investigate this, healthy adults scoring low or high on psychopathic traits (N=23 each) performed the error-responsibility task, a social variant of the Flanker task, in two contexts: they were led to believe their mistakes either resulted in non-harmful consequence (soft sound) or harmful consequence (loud, aversive sound) for a confederate. Error-related event-related potentials in the form of the error-related negativity (ERN), the early error positivity (Pe) and the late Pe were recorded as electrophysiological correlates of performance monitoring and analysed with linear mixed effect models. The study hypothesised that those scoring high on psychopathic traits would show reduced ERN amplitudes and differentiate less between the harmful versus non-harmful context than low scorers. As expected, ERN amplitudes were reduced for high scores in comparison to low scorers; context, however, did not affect any electrophysiological measures. Early and late Pe as well as behavioural measures were generally unaffected by psychopathic traits. These results indicate those scoring high on psychopathic traits engage in less performance monitoring in social responsibility contexts than low scorers, although further research is required to explore mediating factors such as motivation and examine whether this differs to a non-social context.","['social performance monitoring', 'psychopathic traits', 'error-related negativity', 'event-related potential', 'responsibility']"
The Effect of Atomoxetine on the Functional Connectivity of Large-Scale Brain Networks,"Ramos Valenzuela, Yanitsa","['Rover, M. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Atomoxetine is a prescription drug often used to restore executive (or cognitive) functioning in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and other neuropsychiatric conditions. Moreover, this drug may potentially be ingested by healthy individuals who seek to improve their cognitive performance. However, the effect of atomoxetine on healthy brain functioning remains largely unclear. Network approaches have become useful for studying how the functional connectivity between brain regions may enhance or hinder executive functioning. Accordingly, to further examine the underlying mechanisms of action of atomoxetine, it is relevant to explore how this drug influences the functional connectivity of a large-scale brain network involved in the control of top-down processes: the executive control network (ECN). The aim of this study was thus to investigate the effect of atomoxetine (40 mg) on the functional connectivity of the ECN in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Network analyses were conducted on unpublished functional magnetic resonance (fMRI)-data collected by Chamberlain and colleagues (2009) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects, crossover design in which participants completed a goal-directed fMRI-task (i.e., the temporal discounting task), probing the ECN. Contrary to expectations, a paired-samples permutation test, corrected for multiple comparisons by means of a threshold free cluster enhancement, revealed that the functional connectivity of the participants’ ECN does not increase significantly after ingesting atomoxetine as compared to placebo (p > .05 corrected). Nevertheless, exploratory analyses indicated that, relative to placebo, atomoxetine significantly strengthens the functional connectivity of a frontoparietal network highly associated with cognition and language paradigms (t(14) = 7.61, p = .003). Together, these results suggest that, in healthy individuals, atomoxetine might not have enhancing effects on the processes supported by the ECN but (potentially) on those supported by a frontoparietal network. Atomoxetine might thus have beneficial effects in the cognitive performance of healthy individuals by facilitating certain processes associated with both cognition and language. Further research is however warranted to corroborate these findings in confirmatory studies and enhance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of action of atomoxetine in healthy brain functioning.","['Atomoxetine', 'functional connectivity', 'large-scale brain networks', 'executive control network', 'frontoparietal network', 'healthy individuals.']"
Door de jeugd getekend? Een onderzoek naar de bufferende werking van sociale steun in relatie tot meegemaakte kindermishandeling en angst onder adolescenten,"Kolk, Vera van der","['Geel, M. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"It is estimated that between 89.160 and 127.190 children in the Netherlands experience maltreatment every year, which can cause long term effects such as medical problems, trauma, depression and anxiety. Research has shown that social support is a protective factor for experiencing behavior problems in maltreated individuals. This study examined whether social support moderates the relationship between maltreatment and anxiety by questioning 39 Dutch adolescents between 12 and 17 years old. During lab visits the participants filled out an informed consent and multiple questionnaires like the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS-PC) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Social Support Scales for Children and Adolescents SSSC/SSSA and the Youth Self Report (YSR). A PROCESS-analysis was conducted to determine whether social support moderated the relationship between experienced maltreatment and anxiety. The relationship between child maltreatment and anxiety was found to be non-significant. Results also showed a non-significant negative relationship between social support and anxiety. Furthermore, social support did not moderate the relationship between experienced maltreatment and anxiety. These results may be partially explained by the small sample and the limited number of maltreated children in the sample. Furthermore, the group that experienced anxiety was also lower than expected due to a restriction of range. These results are not as expected, as other research has shown the buffering role of social support in relation to maltreatment and anxiety. Due to previous research and the limitations of this study it is important to implement social support for people who experience anxiety in society. Examples like reading books and school curricula are discussed. Upcoming research should be conducted with a larger and representative sample and ways to diminish social desirability should be taken into consideration.","['anxiety', 'child maltreatment', 'social support', 'moderation', 'buffer']"
IMPLICIT MEMORY METHOD FOR (CYBER) CRIME INVESTIGATION: Differentiating guilty from innocent suspects of cybercrime through the IMMCI method,"Theeuwes, Marieke",['Fenna Poletiek'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The current study investigates a new crime investigation procedure; the Implicit Memory Method for (cybercrime) Investigation (IMMCI). This investigation technique makes use of deficits in human memory. In general people are good at recognizing images they have seen before (recognition memory), but find it difficult to indicate when they have seen a certain image (source memory). The IMMCI method makes use of these memory mechanisms to differentiate guilty suspects (who have seen the crime scene), from innocent suspects (who have not seen the crime scene). Within the study the influence of focused attention and reminding the participant of the previous picture is also measured. During the study participants are shown two sets of pictures. At the first exposure session (T1), one group of participants is exposed to pictures of the crime scene (guilty condition). The other group of participants (innocent condition) is shown pictures of trees (control pictures). During T1 some participants are asked to look for something in the picture, which is intended to elicit focused attention. At the second exposure session (T2), all participants are exposed to pictures of alternative crime scenes. Before being exposed to the second set of pictures, some participants are asked to imagine what pictures they saw at T1, to measure whether this would lead to more source confusion. During the test session (T3) participants are asked to indicate whether they have seen a picture before (recognition memory), and during which session they saw the picture (source memory). The main finding is that all participants were good at indicating whether they saw a picture (recognition memory), however the participants who were exposed to the crime scene and the alternative crime scene had difficulties indicating during which session they saw a certain picture. Asking the participants to imagine what they saw at T1 before being exposed to T2 did not have an effect on recognition- or source memory. An interaction effect was found between attention/no-attention and guilty/innocent. The results indicate that the IMMCI method could be a useful investigation technique to differentiate guilty from innocent suspects.",
Adverse Childhood Experiences: Nieuwe inzichten in de relatie tussen partnergeweld en fysieke kindermishandeling,"Baars, Brenda",['M. Geel'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Background: Child abuse has many negative consequences for the child and the society. Many risk factors of physical child abuse have already been reported, such as adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and intimate partner violence. Previous research has shown that an accumulation of 4 or more ACEs in the parents, significantly increases the risk of intergenerational trauma. However, previous research has not addressed a possible moderating relationship of parental ACEs within the domain of (physical) child abuse. The present study is the first study to examine the moderating association of parental ACEs. Objective: The aim of the present study is to examine the moderating relationship of parental ACEs within the relationship of intimate partner violence and child physical abuse. The research question was: Is the relationship between intimate partner violence and physical child maltreatment in children aged 3 to 18 years moderated by the parents' cumulative ACE score? Method: The participants of this study were parents (N=645) with a report to ‘Veilig Thuis’ under the heading of domestic violence. Of all participants, 73,5% were female and 83.9% were born in the Netherlands. All participants were collected from a larger study conducted by the Verwey-Jonker Institute. The parents completed the ACE questionnaire, the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale and the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale. The results were measured by a moderator analysis in PROCESS. Results: Intimate partner violence is a positive predictor of physical child abuse. However, ACEs of parents do not moderate the relationship. Conclusion: Future research is advised to take into account the intensity of an ACE and the influence of a restriction of range. Current research showed that intimate partner violence has negative consequences that do not decrease over time. It is important that everyone who is dealing with intimate partner violence receives help to limit these consequences.",
The effect of social anxiety on gaze patterns in a face-to-face conversation,"Kim, Da Hye","['Chen, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The relationship between social anxiety and gaze avoidance was investigated in previous research and indicated that socially anxious individuals avoid eye contact during social interaction to reduce the level of social anxiety. However, recent studies suggested that socially anxious individuals might fixate on alternative sources of social information to gather social cues and improve social interactions. The current study aimed to investigate the influence of social anxiety on gaze patterns during social interaction. The participants (n = 59) were asked to engage in a face-to-face gettingacquainted conversation with a confederate. The fixation counts and duration on the mouth and the eyes were collected using an eye-tracker and the level of social anxiety was measured using Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self Report (LSAS-SR). The results showed there was no effect of social anxiety on gaze patterns, in terms of fixation count and duration, during a face-to-face conversation. However, the study found a marginally significant effect on facial regions regardless of the social anxiety level, indicating that participants fixated more frequently on the mouth than on the eyes. The current study suggested that the mouth region may be an important variable to consider in future investigations. The limitations of the current study highlighted the need for further investigation with a larger sample, diversely distributed levels of social anxiety, and naturalistic conditions.","['social anxiety, gaze pattern, eye contact, face-to-face conversation, eye tracking']"
"Helpt Beeline Reader studenten een tekst sneller te lezen en beter te begrijpen?

Sometimes studies show that an application claims to influence reading behavior, but in practice, this effect is not achieved. This also applies to the subject of this study, namely the application Beeline Reader. The current study investigates to what extent the application Beeline Reader makes reading a digital text easier and faster for students, as they claim on their website. Students read eight texts, including four in black font color and four in Beeline font colors. Students (N=19) were randomly assigned to one of four different layouts, each with a combination of single or enlarged line spacing with short or long lines. Data were collected with eye-tracking and reading comprehension questions and analyzed with a Repeated Measures ANOVA. Results showed that the use of Beeline font colors had no effect on reading speed (duration first-pass reading, duration second-pass reading and duration return-sweep) or text comprehension. In contrast, the layout with single line spacing and long lines was found to cause a lower reading speed (first-pass reading and second-pass reading) as well as the layout with enlarged line spacing and long lines (first-pass reading). In conclusion, the use of Beeline font colors has no positive effect on students' reading speed and text comprehension, but no negative effect either. For follow-up research, it might be useful to test the effect of Beeline font colors on different target groups.","['Beeline Reader', 'opmaak', 'letterkleur', 'leessnelheid', 'tekstbegrip']"

Prediction Model for Irritable Bowel Syndrome using Routine Primary Care Data,"van de Graaf, Maud",['Willeke Kitselaar'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex disorder, in which patients experience abdominal pain, diarrhea and constipation among other symptoms. Many studies have tried to examine the medical and psychological aspects of the disorder; however, the symptoms patients experience can vary a lot. Because of this, examinations need to be done which can be burdensome to the patient. Also, the time that passes waiting for the right diagnosis leads to frustration in patient and clinician. The aim of this study is to investigate if there is a possibility to make a prediction model, to be able to predict IBS two years before a patient gets the actual diagnosis. With this prediction model we want to predict the variables and symptoms patients show to provide the diagnosis in a quicker, more concise way. To make the model we used data from an electronic primary healthcare database from GPs in Leiden and The Hague. This consists of different symptoms patients have reported. From this data patients will be selected with the IBS-diagnosis, and without the IBS-diagnosis. There were 3586 patients selected from the primary healthcare database, from which 326 had the IBS-diagnosis. From all the available variables from the primary healthcare data, we selected certain prediction variables. These certain variables can be used to generate a prediction model to predict the IBS-diagnosis in patients. This study shows that prediction models have a potential to lighten the burden of the patients and to shorten the time waiting for the right diagnosis.","['Irritable bowel syndrome, routine care data, primary care']"

Explaining differences in learning speed in the decision-making task of the International Brain laboratory by light cycle and training time consistency,"Wulfse, Felice","['Urai, A.E.', 'Ghosh, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The International Brain Laboratory created a standardized and reproducible decision-making task set up, and trained over hundred mice across seven laboratories in three countries. They discovered that almost all mice are trainable and performance increases in a similar pattern, but learning speed was variable across mice and across laboratories. This study aimed to investigate the differences in learning speed between mice and laboratories and explore the impact of the light cycle and training time consistency on these differences. Our hypothesis was that mice trained in an inverted light cycle (dark during the day and light during the night) would have higher learning speed than those trained in a non-inverted light cycle (light during the day and dark during the night) due to their nocturnal nature. Additionally, we believed that training time consistency would also influence learning speed. The results from our mixture analysis indicated that there may be an interaction effect between the light cycle and training time consistency, but this appears to vary depending on how you quantify learning speed and training time consistency. Further research should focus on the quantifications of the variables mentioned above and additional analyses.","['International Brain Laboratory, circadian rhythm, decision-making task, learning speed, light cycle, training time consistency']"

J']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"A good vocabulary is a prerequisite for a school career without many problems. The vocabulary level at which children enter kindergarten varies widely, which is due to the language environment in which children grow up. Current study examined the effectivity of e-Prent&ABC. This program combines interactive reading with the 4-Cycle-model for expanding the literacy. This study also examined the effect of an additional differentiation. The additional differentiation is designed for the low-achieving preschoolers to give them an extra boost for expanding their vocabulary. During the additional differentiation the low-achieving preschoolers read the picture book once more and afterwards they were actively involved in processing different target words from the picture book. Current study investigates which processing form (open-ended questions or labeling) is most effective for the additional differentiation. Finally, current research examined which child factor plays a role in the success of the additional differentiation. Current study had a quantitative design with both a within and between factor. In this study, 81 preschoolers participated with a mean age of 5.26 years. These preschoolers were divided into two groups; 41 high and 40 low achievers. The results showed us that the e-Prent&ABC program was effective for stimulating the early literacy and that the additional differentiation increased the vocabulary level of the low achievers further. During the additional differentiation answering open questions was the most effective processing form. The success of the additional differentiation does not depend on various child factors (e.g. executive function or phonological awareness).","['interactive reading, 4-Cycle-model, vocabulary, literacy, additional differentiation']"

De rol van taal en emotieherkenning in externaliserend probleemgedrag onder kinderen en jongeren,"Klein, Tirza","['Jong, R. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Children with externalising behavior problems often show difficulty in their social communication towards others (Verhulst et al., 2014). However, little studies have yet examined the relationship between social communication and externalizing problem behavior. The present study therefore explored the role of social communication in externalizing behavior problems among children at high risk of developing future criminal behavior. Participants were 130 (pre)adolescent children (5 to 16 years old) at high risk of developing criminal behavior in the future (74.6% boys). The children were recruited through the “PIT-project”, an ongoing intervention in the city of Amsterdam aimed at reducing externalizing behavior problems among children. Social communication skills were operationalized as receptive vocabulary, facial emotion recognition and affective prosody recognition. Receptive vocabulary was measured using the task Begrippen en aanwijzingen volgen (BAV) of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF-4NL; Semel et al., 2010). Facial emotion recognition was measured with the Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) test (Bowen et al., 2014), and affective prosody with the prosody task from the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks (ANT; De Sonneville, 1999). The results suggest a significant small positive correlation between each of the different social communication variables. In contrast to the hypothesis, receptive vocabulary, facial emotion recognition and affective prosody recognition were no significant predictors of externalizing behavior problems. 12 months after receiving the PIT-intervention, externalizing behavior problems were significantly reduced among the children. Children with social communication difficulties showed a greater decline in externalizing problem behaviors after following the PIT-intervention, compared to children without social communication difficulties. However, this effect was only near significant. These results add to the growing literature on possible underlying mechanisms of externalizing problem behavior that could provide directions for future interventions.",
Een blik op de accuraatheid en uitgebreidheid van de verklaring tijdens het kindverhoor,"Buitelaar, Danitia","['Lotz, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Through the years more and more minors are being heard as victims of sexual offenses by the police. During interrogation, the minor is expected to tell as much as possible about the events concerned. There are factors that may influence the course and outcomes of the interrogation. For example, the method of interrogation should be well tailored to the victim by considering age and developmental stage. This is important because children seem to make more accurate statements when they feel supported and at ease. In addition to factors like age and development, there are other factors that may be related to the minor’s final statement. The current study examined to what extent neutral and forensic elements during an online yoga class are related to the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the statement during the interrogation and whether personality might be a predictive factor in this regard. It was important to investigate this because there are many contradictions about the relationships between memory, stress and personality. Children among the age of eight and eleven years old took part in an online yoga class which consisted of neutral and forensic elements. The forensics elements reflect situations or actions that could possibly happen during sexual offenses, for example children had to come close to the camera. After one week the participants took part in an online interrogation in which they had to tell the interrogator all about the yoga class. The recordings of the interrogation were transcribed to encode and statistical analyses could be done. A statistically significant difference was found for the accuracy of the statement. Contrary to expectations, the average percentage accuracy for forensic elements was lower than percentage for neutral elements. No significant difference was found for comprehensiveness of the statement. Personality was not predictive for the accuracy of both neutral and forensic elements. Nor was personality predictive for the comprehensiveness of both neutral and forensic elements. These findings confirm the contradictions shown in literature. Further research is necessary to ensure that interrogation of minors proceeds as good as possible.","['kindverhoor, accuraatheid, uitgebreidheid']"
Wounds of Generations: An Investigation of Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma Exploring the Role of Parent-Child Attachment and Child Personality among High-Risk Families,"Compagner, Tamara","['Vliet, M.S. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"A growing body of literature suggests that parental trauma can be passed on to children, possibly creating persistent intergenerational cycles of trauma. The present study aimed to obtain a better understanding of the intergenerational transmission of trauma by focusing on the relationship between parental trauma symptoms and child trauma symptoms among 630 parent-child dyads who were previously involved with Child Protection Services (CPS). Additionally, the potentially mediating role of parent-child attachment within intergenerational trauma was investigated. Finally, the study looked at the Big Five dimensions of child personality (i.e., Neuroticism, Extraversion, Imagination, Benevolence, and Conscientiousness) as possible risk or protective factors in the process of intergenerational transmission of trauma. Results suggested that parental trauma symptoms predicted child trauma symptoms. Moreover, parents’ exposure to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and child gender did not predict child trauma symptoms, implying that parents’ current trauma symptomology was a stronger predictor of child trauma than exposure to ACEs. Moreover, approximately 10% of the relationship between parental trauma symptoms and child trauma symptoms was explained by parent-child attachment. Finally, provisional support was found for the moderating roles of Benevolence, Extraversion, and Imagination, suggesting that children with high levels of these traits are less affected by their parents’ trauma. Although no causal conclusions could be drawn based on this correlational study, the results supported the notion of intergenerational transmission of trauma. In addition, opportunities were proposed for breaking cycles of intergenerational trauma, such as focusing on differentiation of children from their parents’ trauma, early recognition of trauma symptoms in parents, and targeting the parent-child attachment within families with histories of trauma. In sum, the present study offered additional support for the intergenerational transmission of trauma and has pointed to the possibly important roles of parent-child attachment and child personality in discontinuation of intergenerational cycles of trauma.","['intergenerational transmission of trauma', 'trauma symptomology', 'adverse childhood experiences', 'parent-child attachment', 'child personality']"
