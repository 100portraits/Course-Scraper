Dealing with policies and working culture: Working mothers in Tokyo tell their experience,"Steenmetz, Nina Maria Kulumi","['Ezawa, Aya']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The reality of a shrinking labor market as the population is aging and birthrate is declining in Japan, is asking for more female participation. Changing economic demands and working conditions is leading to an increasing number of double-income families. It is creating variety in the gender roles and contributing to a new order. A study of ten qualitative interviews was conducted to examine the working conditions and experiences of working mothers in Tokyo. The case study shows that working mothers are facing three main challenges when trying to find a work-life balance: (1) time management, (2) high responsibility of work within the household and (3) working culture that impacts career. The case study of this thesis gives an insightful assessment of policies, what they do and do not address. Analyzing narratives and understanding how mothers approach their working situation and lifestyle is an important element in discussing the work-family balance to clarify remaining issues in working culture. It turns out that informal resources and strategies are important to overcome or deal with the challenges, as formal policies still seem to lack in addressing part of the core labor issues and remaining gender inequality.","['women employment', 'japan', 'working mothers', 'work life balance', 'employment', 'interview', 'working culture', 'family policies', 'policies']"

Uzbek Jihadists and the Ideal of the Caliphate: Understanding the Motives of Uzbeks to Join Daesh,"Lam, Monica","['Berg, Gabrielle van de']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"After five international attacks commited by Uzbek individuals in the name of Daesh in 2016 and 2017, many (news)articles have been quick to speak of a trend regarding radicalization in Uzbekistan and Central Asia. Research has shown that scholars either look at internal or external factors for the radicalization of Uzbek nationals. This study aims to explain the apparent recent interest of Uzbek nationals to join Daesh and if we can speak of a myth or a phenomenon regarding radicalization in Uzbekistan. Building on existing work on radicalization in Central Asia and Uzbekistan, this research both analyzes the internal and external factors. These internal and external factors have been applied on case studies of three Uzbek individuals committing the international attacks. The analysis was based on a literature research on the history of the region, the Uzbekistan state since 1991 onwards and migration from Central Asia towards Russia, and a textual analysis of (1) videos, messages, and websites, and (2) interviews of journalists with friends, neighbors and family members of the Uzbek individuals in the case study. In addition, the social movement theory and social psychology theory were applied accordingly. The results indicate that we should not speak of a phenomenon regarding radicalization in Uzbekistan. Besides, the case study shows that external factors particularly explain the apparent recent interest of Uzbek nationals to join Daesh. Nevertheless, internal factors could indeed explain other radicalization processes, such as why Uzbek nationals decided to join the Hizb ut-Tahrir and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.","['Central Asia', 'Uzbekistan', 'Daesh', 'Islamic State', 'ISIS', 'Radicalization', 'social movement theory', 'social psychology theory']"

Hollywood war movies & US foreign policy in Afghanistan before and after 9/11,"Alami, Roman","['Blezer, H.W.A.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The prime purpose of this paper is examining the varieties of Orientalist discourse in major Hollywood war movies which simultaneous depict Afghanistan and show favour towards US foreign policy. In order to draw a conclusion, the methodological framework was set using Orientalist themes from the work of Edward Said as a way of examining the discourse within the sample movies. The first movie examined is Rambo: First Blood III, set during the close of the Cold War. To have variety across the movies’ political landscapes and times, the second examined was the award-winning Zero Dark Thirty, set in the post-9/11 era. The last movie, Lone Survivor, however, was picked in order to challenge my main hypothesis – it is a US war movie depicting brotherhood between the two sides. My main conclusion was that the motive throughout all three movies was the Orientalist mindscape being exploited for military justification of the US wars abroad. Be it supporting or demonising the other, it always had a favourable outcome for US foreign policy rather than being critical of it. Seen from the point of view of art reflecting reality, it serves as a model showcasing how Orientalist discourse can be exploited, thus motivating military operations in the Orient. This in turn amplifies conflict and creates false symbolic imprints on audiences attracted to the genre.","['hollywood', 'war', 'movies', '9/11', 'Zero Dark Thirty', 'Lone Survivor', 'US Foreign Policy', 'Rambo: First Blood 3', 'Afghanistan', 'Orientalism', 'cold war', 'Edward Said', 'discourse analysis', 'US military']"

A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words: Comparing the Representations of Ethnic Minorities in Official Images in the People’s Republic of China,"Haas, Hidde de","['Nie, Y.', 'Burgos Martinez, E.E.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on the representation of ethnic minorities in official images in the People's Republic of China (PRC) during Mao's chairmanship (1949-1976) and 2018-2019. Representation of ethnic minorities in the PRC has been researched before, but most of this research was focused on solely one time period. By studying two different time periods, the development of the representation through time is made visible which can provide insights regarding future development. Since the PRC's government controls almost all information outlets within the country, the analyzed images (propaganda posters and newspaper images) representing Chinese ethnic minorities therefore reflect the government's official discourse of these people. The results of this research show that the official discourse of ethnic minorities in the PRC has remained relatively similar. Ethnic minorities are portrayed in images from both times as less civilized, more backward, more exotic and inferior to their Han counterparts.","['China', 'Ethnic minorities', 'Representation', 'Discourse', 'Propaganda posters', 'Newspaper images']"

There is an academic debate whether this rise is peaceful and possibly mutual beneficial or that it is a threat, economically speaking as well as political. This thesis aims to determine to what extent Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) affects the economic sovereignty of Laos. In this context, economic sovereignty is defined as the power and capability of a national government to decisions make independent of the interests of other governments. Using quantitative and qualitative research and various case studies, research has been conducted to examine the effects of Chinese FDI on the economic sovereignty of Laos in the last five years including current times. The results indicate a strong correlation between Chinese economic activity in Laos and the deepening of economic dependency on China as well as a decay of economic sovereignty for Laos due to significant debt accumulation.","['China', 'Laos', 'economy', 'politics', 'BRI', 'FDI', 'Asia', 'Southeast Asia']"
Culinary traditions as a challenge to the UNESCO's conception of heritage: a critical comparison between the Gastronomic Meal of the French and Washoku,"Lé, Camille","['Cwiertka, Katarzyna J.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"It is commonly accepted that food is part of heritage; indeed, food, because of its universal character, carries an emotional value that makes it a fundamental component of identity-making. Food heritage was given an international recognition in 2010 when the UNESCO inscribed the first culinary practices on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Taking the Gastronomic Meal of the French registered in 2010, and the Japanese Washoku inscribed in 2013, this paper explores the issues surrounding the listing of national culinary traditions by the UNESCO. First, comparing the registration processes in France and Japan allows to understand how both elements can be perceived as “invented traditions”. However, the inscription had various consequences; if both countries used the UNESCO label for political and economic purposes, it seems like France did it to a lesser degree than Japan. Finally, a newspapers analysis shows the divergent reactions in the French and Japanese media and underlines the political nature of the inscription.","['Washoku', 'Intangible heritage', 'Food', 'Gastronomic meal of the French', 'Gastrodiplomacy', 'Critical heritage studies', 'UNESCO', 'Nation-branding', 'Japan', 'France']"

Violence and local manifestations of global contention.,"Shabalina, Ksenia","['Augusteijn, Joost']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Looking at the possibility of violence in local manifestations of global protest movements can help predict the likelihood of violence occurring during new instances of protest. Looing at Occupy Wall Street and the Global Justice movement and their local chapters in New York, London and Hamburg has led to several insights. Despite the disconnect between conflict and violence, the underlying logic of using violence as a repertoire of contention becomes evident. The time available for both the preparation of the protest and the response from the authorities do play a role in determining the degree of violence. Spontaneous protests, such as Occupy Wall Street in New York and London only were met with attention, and later violence, when their primary goal of public deliberation became evident. The violence was coupled with attempts at eviction. In case of Global Justice Movement protests as a response to the G20 summits in London and Hamburg, the activists had a longer time to prepare, which gave the authorities to prepare a response. Moreover, the protesters only had a limited time available and had to utilise that time to make their demands known. It appears, therefor, that the temporality of a protest is a significant factor in the likelihood of violence.","['Global', 'Protest', 'Movement', 'Occupy', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Justice', 'Activism', 'Violence']"
How to Teach Chinese Characters? Theory and Practice in Dutch High Schools,"Cameron, Mara","['Sybesma, R.P.E.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Learning Chinese characters is one of the major challenges CFL learners face, and it may in some cases become overwhelming and cause learners to lose their motivation for learning the language. However, the character script is one of Mandarin Chinese’s most salient features, and is indeed one of the aspects that draws learners to learning Mandarin in the first place. This brings us to an important question: How should Chinese characters be taught to CFL learners? In The Netherlands, Mandarin is now being taught at more and more high schools, but as this is a relatively recent development, not that many Dutch textbooks are as yet available for Dutch high school student CFL learners. This study has examined: What research has had to say about how to teach Chinese characters to CFL learners (‘Theory’); How several beginner-level textbooks in use at Dutch high schools teach Chinese characters (‘Practice’); The views and approaches of a group of Chinese CFL teachers and a group of Dutch CFL teachers regarding teaching Chinese characters (‘Practice’); and finally: To what extent practice, especially practice in Dutch high schools, appears to correspond with theory (‘Practice versus Theory’). Insofar as research has provided clear results or suggestions, and insofar as the present study has touched upon the corresponding topics, practice in fact appears to closely correspond to theory. It is also clear, however, that more research is needed.","['CFL teaching', 'Chinese characters', 'Dutch high schools']"

The discursive construction of Chinese modern history in education: the century of humiliation,"Friesen, Jip","['Teh, Limin']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since the Xi leadership, the Communist Party lays significantly more emphasis on the importance of history and its education, which is reflected in the party’s overall discourse, institutional changes and the compiling of a new series of unified textbooks. Education is key in the national socialization process, and can be utilized for fostering patriotism. This study is concerned principally with the discursive construction of a key period in Chinese history in the new junior high school textbooks: the “century of humiliation”. Through combining one of the approaches within the critical discourse analysis school and ethnographic research methods, this study dissects the discourse within in the textbooks and examines the transmission process of the discourse in the classroom environment. Furthermore, the research also analyses the contextual environment in which the textbooks arose, taking into consideration the broader official discourse and relevant recent trends. This study reveals the applied discursive strategies and demonstrates their significance in creating a historical truth.","['discourse', 'patriotism', 'humiliation', 'education', 'history']"

The Internationalization of Internal Conflict: Regional Politics and Intervention in Yemen,"Remmits, Femke","['Yenen, Alp']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In international politics and throughout academic literature, the current civil war in Yemen (2015-present) has regularly been discussed as being a proxy war between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran. As a consequence, the international community’s military interference in what has been labelled by the United Nations as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world has been rather limited. This research aims to counter the general proxy warfare narrative, and to provide an alternative explanation of the causes and dynamics of Yemen’s devastating conflict. Therefore, this thesis will critically analyze the context, development of events, and transformation of the war in Yemen and discuss how to characterize the internationalization of Yemen’s internal conflict over the period 2014-2018. To formulate an answer to this question, the thesis will first discuss the Saudi-Iranian rivalry in the contemporary Middle East and the use of proxy warfare in their regional balance of power. Then, the theoretical framework of internationalization of civil war will be discussed to explicate the connection between domestic and international dimensions of conflicts. Next, the thesis will analyse the internal social and political causes of the war in Yemen to assess the original nature of the conflict, and discuss the developments from the outbreak of the civil war to its present internationalized condition. Together with an analysis of the extent and motivations of the Saudi and Iranian military interventions in the conflict, this research will develop the argument that the war in Yemen (2014-2018) is essentially an internationalized civil war. The proxy warfare narrative fails to accurately describe the causes, dynamics, and international intervention processes of this internationalized internal conflict, and the use of this rhetoric by Saudi Arabia should be interpreted as a political tool to justify its military intervention in Yemen’s domestic struggles to secure its own regional strategic objectives. Moreover, the limited support of Iran to the Houthis remains far too marginal to have any significant impact on the balance of power in Yemen. The research and arguments will be substantiated by academic study of regional politics experts and by analysing UN reports, reportages from independent journalists, and interviews with policymakers. Understanding the highly local and non-ideological origins and dimensions of the war in Yemen is fundamental to any future attempts at conflict resolution at the international level. Analysing the process of internationalization, as well as the contemporary nature of the conflict, will provide significant insights regarding what type of mediation would be most effective. Furthermore, emphasizing the escalated and internationalized nature of the Yemeni civil war since its outbreak in 2015, as opposed to the general proxy warfare narrative, will hopefully contribute to the international community’s recognition of the necessity and responsibility to resolve this humanitarian disaster. Academically, the research will contribute to the academic body of literature on the internationalization of internal conflicts. In addition, 1 this thesis will generate a greater understanding of proxy warfare and expose the dangers of the use of proxy war frames.","['Yemen', 'Huthis', 'Proxy war', 'Internationalized War', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Iran']"

Often referred to as twin countries due to the wide array of shared features; they are similar in terms of demography, ethnic composition, geography and post-colonial political structures. While both emerged from comparable instances of civil war containing elements of genocidal violence, Rwanda’s conflict ended by a rebel victory, whereas Burundi’s civil war resulted in a negotiated settlement. Therefore, how has the rebel victory vis-á-vis the negotiated settlement contributed to preventing civil war recurrence in post-conflict Rwanda and Burundi, respectively? Connecting concepts of multiple sovereignty and institutions with Collier’s model of breaking the conflict trap, this thesis argues that the rebel victory in Rwanda has contributed to preventing civil war recurrence through economic development, whereas Burundi’s negotiated settlement was more effective in resolving the grievances underlying conflict.","['Rebel victory', 'Negotiated settlement', 'conflict trap']"
Problems with defining ‘autism’ as a spectrum disorder,"Stift, Megan","['Sleutels, Jan']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since its inception, many changes to the concept of ‘autism’ have been suggested, by both autistic people and researchers. Recently, the number of people diagnosed with a form of autism has increased, and a contemporary topic of discussion is whether it should be defined as a disorder, a mere human variation, or something else. As society is inclined to stigmatise eccentricity, it is important that the definition used does not harm autistic people, or misrepresent the large variety of their experiences. This thesis argues that the fifth Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders’ (DSM-5) current conceptualisation of autism as ‘Autism Spectrum Disorder’ is both inaccurate and dangerous. Definitions from all DSMs are described, and the motivations behind the changes between DSMs are considered, alongside arguments from a collection of philosophers. The conclusion is that the components ‘Spectrum’ and ‘Disorder’ in ‘ASD’ risk inciting stigmatisation and suggest a more uniform expression than autism actually has. Thus, an alternative definition much be found. This alternative, which could be pursued through further research, should give autistic people a way to think about their identity, and non-autistic people a way to accurately understand and describe the diverse autistic experiences, both negative and positive.","['autism', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'neurotype', 'neurotypical variation', 'philosophy', 'concept analysis', 'psychiatry', 'philosophy of language', 'identity', 'disorder']"

As language is a powerful tool for identity construction, and its nature of being redefined within specific contexts, allows for CDA to observe how identities are constructed within discourses. Hence, by using Critical Discourse Analysis as an approach to analyzing music excerpts, this research will argue that the album Sobrevivendo no Inferno, by the Brazilian rap group Racionais MCs, uses specific structural and stylistic religious features as a semantic tool for Afro-Brazilian identity reconstruction. After presenting the Brazilian context of inequality and marginalization of peripheries, this research will apply the three stage model of analysis presented by Fairclough (1984): description, interpretation, and explanation of text. Although the primary focus of CDA has been on analyses of texts containing discourses produced by controlling groups, this research will apply the CDA approach to analyze discourse of resistance against dominating groups.","['Critical Discourse Analysis', 'CDA', 'Marginalization', 'Linguistics', 'Music', 'Identity Construction', 'Peripheralization', 'Brazilian Rap', 'Racionais MCs']"

"A Phenomenological Understanding of Fjordenhus Building in Vejle, Denmark: The Role of “Art-and-Architecture” on Contemporaneity","Chaves Ferraz, Maíra","['Shobeiri, Ali']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the last two to three decades, throughout the world, urban and architectural spaces have been losing their identities over cities, driven mainly by commercial and economic interests. Nevertheless, a number of artists have been escaping from their own traditional sphere of activity and exploring questions about space, the main tool of architects. These artists have been creating innovative hybrid works of art-and-architecture that highlight the singularity of places. Furthermore, they have also been focusing on the spectator’s bodily experiences using a phenomenological approach on their artworks. Recognizing these issues, this research opens discussions on how the adoption of phenomenological aspects in the creative process of art-and-architecture can contribute to an embodied experience through the artist Olafur Eliasson’s constructed work Fjordenhus (2018), in Vejle, Denmark, in partnership with the architect Sebastian Behmann. The main argument is that works embedded in a phenomenological bias can serve as a tool for resuscitation and vitality of architectural spaces in a relationship between architecture, space, and body. This study aims to contribute to the recent debates, concerning the tenuous limit of the interdisciplinary fields of visual art and architecture, with the participation of an artist in the conceptual process of an architectural project.","['Art', 'architecture', 'contemporaneity', 'phenomenology']"

Stimulering van de lokale journalistiek naar Engels model,"Veen, Mariska van der","['Jong, Jaap de']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De aanleiding voor het schrijven van dit onderzoek werd gevormd door de zorgen die er zijn over de lokale journalistiek die zich wereldwijd in zwaar weer bevindt. Kritische lokale journalistiek zit in de verdrukking door bezuinigingen als gevolg van onder andere dalende advertentie-inkomsten, concurrentie van het internet en de toenemende invloed van het bedrijfsleven. Hierdoor vindt op lokaal niveau onvoldoende controle plaats van de macht. Deze problemen spelen ook in Nederland, ook hier is de lokale journalistiek onvoldoende in staat om de lokale raden te controleren. In onder andere Nieuw-Zeeland, de Verenigde Staten en meerdere Europese landen werd besloten om fondsen op te richten om de lokale journalistiek te stimuleren. In Engeland besloot de BBC in mei 2016 om per jaar ongeveer 9,5 miljoen euro te investeren in 150 lokale journalisten. Deze journalisten kwamen in dienst bij lokale media verspreid over het hele land. De taak van deze journalisten is om verslag te doen van lokale autoriteiten en lokaal beleid voor de lokale media en voor de BBC. Ook in Nederland wordt nagedacht over oplossingsrichtingen. Er is nog weinig informatie over het BBC-model in Nederland bekend en wetenschappelijke informatie ontbreekt volledig. Dit onderzoek is daarom van toegevoegde waarde voor een beter begrip van het BBC-model en de mogelijke kansen voor dit model in Nederland. De hoofdvraag is dan ook: Wat zijn de kansen en bedreigingen voor het toepassen van het BBC-model voor stimulering van de lokale journalistiek in Nederland? De werkwijze bestond uit het analyseren van de ontwerpplannen, uiteindelijke plannen en de evaluatie van het BBC-model. Daarnaast werden de documenten bestudeerd van betrokken organisaties als de News Media Association (NMA), de National Union of Journalists (NUJ) en de Engelse overheid. Verder werd gekeken naar de kritiek die geuit is door verschillende partijen. Een grote bron van informatie vormden de interviews die afgenomen zijn met Nederlandse nieuwsspecialisten en de directeur van het Engelse stimuleringsmodel. Wat buiten dit onderzoek valt is het interviewen van Engelse critici en het uitvoeren van een eigen evaluatie door bijvoorbeeld het bestuderen van producties die door stimulering van het BBC-model tot stand zijn gekomen. De belangrijkste conclusies van dit onderzoek zijn dat kansen voor dit model zeker aanwezig zijn, er is onder andere, net als in Engeland, dringend behoefte aan stimulering. En bepaalde focuspunten van het model, zoals de nadruk op controle van lokale overheden, zijn ook in Nederland meer dan welkom. Maar de bedreigingen zijn in de meerderheid en lijken een opeenstapeling van moeilijk te overkomen hindernissen. Eerst zullen in Nederland grote veranderingen plaats moeten vinden in en om het medialandschap op zowel lokaal, regionaal als landelijk niveau. Gekeken zou moeten worden naar de mogelijkheid van het op- en inrichten van een organisatie waarin voor al deze verschillende niveaus van nieuws brengen ruimte is. Pas dan zou er ook ruimte kunnen ontstaan voor het implementeren van een model als de Local News Partnerships.","['Lokale journalistiek', 'stimulering', 'BBC-model']"

In een land dat nog in puin lag, was de Grundgesetz het resultaat van een langdurig proces waarin de belangen van geallieerden, oud en nieuw, Duitsers en politici elk een eigen plek moesten vinden. Een politieke, nationale en internationale kijk naar een van de belangrijkste periodes in de geschiedenis van het moderne Duitsland. Tegen de achtergrond van de Koude Oorlog zou een voor Duitsland unieke grondwet worden opgesteld. Westen en oosten begonnen lijnrecht tegenover elkaar te staan, het wantrouwen jegens de Duitse bevolking was enorm en spanningen binnen het westelijke bondgenootschap maakte de politieke toekomst van Duitsland onzeker. Het proces was moeilijk, speelde zich tot op de hoogste niveaus af en zou niet over een dag ijs gaan. In deze scriptie gaan we terug naar net na het einde van het grootste en meest destructieve conflict in de geschiedenis van de mensheid, in een periode waarin men de draad weer moest oppakken. De periode 1945-1949 in de politieke geschiedenis van Duitsland zal bekeken worden met als focus het proces richting 24 mei 1949, met daarin de hoofdrolspelers, de beslissende momenten en de spanningen die uiteindelijk leidden tot de politieke wording van West-Duitsland, en in het verlengde daarvan het huidige Duitsland, in de vorm van de Grundgesetz für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland.","['Duitsland', 'Grundgesetz', 'Grondwet', 'Bezetting Duitsland', '1945-1949', 'Duitse deling', 'West-Duitsland', 'Koude Oorlog', 'Zesmogendhedenconferentie', 'Geallieerden', 'Frankfurt Documenten', 'Herrenchiemsee', 'Parlamentarische Rat', 'staatsvorming']"
The Inevitable Resemblance between Terrorism and Genocide,"Akker, Josephine van den","['De Bruijn, Mirjam']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"According to the Global Terrorism Index, Nigeria’s Boko Haram is one of the worlds most deadly insurgencies. Even though there have been national as well as international efforts to try and halt the sect, with the latest attack on June 16th 2018, they can still be seen as claiming many lives today. Looking at genocide according to the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime Genocide, it can be argued that Boko Haram is committing a genocide under international law. No definition of genocide is as internationally recognised and legally binding as the United Nations definition in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime Genocide. Despite this, throughout history the United Nations and the international community have been reluctant to name various crimes a genocide, as this would result to the increased legal and moral pressure for the international community to respond. An example is during the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Since this genocide, the United Nations has continuously claimed that genocides can never ‘happen again’. However, looking at Nigeria and Boko Haram there has been no claim of a genocide according to the United Nations. If the United Nations would officially recognise Boko Haram as committing a genocide under international law, the international community would legally be pressured to respond to the violence.","['Genocide', 'Boko Haram']"

Emotionally Speaking: Expressing anger or Happiness in Dutch or English by Turkish-Dutch bilingual teenagers and ESL Dutch teenagers,"Huijsman, Michele","['Grijzenhout, Janet']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis will test the hypothesis that Turkish- Dutch teenagers and Dutch English as a second learner teenagers, code-switch back to their first language, Turkish or Dutch when they are expressing the emotions ‘anger’ and ‘happiness’ in Dutch (second language for the Turkish-Dutch teenagers) or English (second language for the Turkish- Dutch teenagers, but third language for the Turkish- Dutch teenagers). According to scholars like Dewaele and Pavlenko among others, the first language is more encoded in the bilingual’s memory and that the first language feels more vivid and natural to the bilingual participant or the second language learner, therefore they codeswitch back to their first language when they are expressing strong emotions such as ‘anger’(Dewaele 119). However, there are also participants from Pavlenko’s study who claim to express their emotions in their second language, because it is the language of self-control. In order to test the hypothesis, 16 Turkish- Dutch participants and 16 Dutch participants, who varied between the ages twelve till twenty-one, had to fill in a survey, which contains questions about language exposure and language use. The survey also contains indirect questions about social- economic status. After the survey the participants were asked to do a role-play in either Dutch or English. They were randomly given a cartoon, which contains animals who were either best friends or complete strangers to each other, the cartoon had either a good end or unhappy end. The participants were audio-recorded and these audio recordings were transcribed word for word. Later on, they received a qualitrics link to fill in a final survey for a follow up study. The results of the survey, transcribed conversations and the follow up study were analysed on the base of sex, age, and ethnicity. Due to the experimental setting, the hypothesis could not be confirmed.","['emotions', 'bilingualism']"

The study was conducted through a frame analysis in the context of the Shannon and Weaver communication model. The speeches were chosen according to the occurence of the keyword ""China"" (mentioned at least four times). The four frames identified in the official political speeches are (1) China as an opportunity, (2) China as a global power, (3) China as a role model, and (4) China as a threat. In the context of previous research, economic cooperation remained the main factor in advancing diplomatic relations between Germany and China. Chinese competition in regards to financial institutions (AIIB) and the Emission Trading System (ETS) were presented under the ""China as a threat"" frame by Angela Merkel. A possible explanation is the shortfall or missing initiatives in those aspects by the European and/or German institutions. More so, this research suggests to expand the term smart power by the elements of normative power in the context of the Chinese development. To expand on this thesis, further research is recommended in regards to the Chinese culture as perceived abroad. Furthermore, a media perspective could give insights about the question, whether political and media publications differ in their perception on the Chinese ""Peaceful Rise"" and analyze which medium is more effective in addressing the audience.","['Merkel', 'speeches', 'Peaceful Rise', 'China', 'Chinese strategy', 'Germany', 'Politics', 'shannon and weaver', 'communication model']"

Uit onderzoek blijkt dat de lokale media, naast het feit dat ze de belangrijkste bron zijn voor lokaal nieuws, bijdragen aan sociale cohesie in de samenleving. Deze casestudy van de lokale krant van Amsterdam Oost (De Brug) beantwoord de onderzoeksvraag van deze scriptie aan de hand van een inhoudsanalyse en een interview met de eindredacteur en uitgever van de krant. Deze onderzoeksvraag is: Hoe wordt sociale cohesie gerepresenteerd in de berichtgeving van de lokale krant van Amsterdam Oost (De Brug)? In totaal zijn 101 artikelen uit De Brug edities oktober 2018 tot en met januari 2019 geanalyseerd. Na de uitvoering van de inhoudsanalyse is gebleken dat twee dimensies vaker terugkomen in de berichtgeving: sociale netwerken en acceptatie van diversiteit. Deze twee dimensies horen bij het domein van sociale relaties, en dit betekent dat sociale cohesie in De Brug het vaakst tot uiting komt in verwijzingen naar de relatie tussen burgers onderling (horizontale relaties). Daarnaast heeft het interview met de hoofdredacteur en uitgever van de krant, Martijn en Linda van den Dobbelsteen, uitgewezen dat er in zekere mate bewust wordt ingezet op het uitdragen van sociale binding in de krant. Deze casestudy van De Brug schetst een beeld van de vormen waarin sociale cohesie terug te vinden is in de berichtgeving van een gemiddeld lokaal nieuwsmedium en duidt de bewuste en onbewuste invloed die een lokale redactie daar op uitoefent.","['sociale cohesie', 'lokale journalistiek', 'inhoudsanalyse']"

China in the UN: Responsibility to Protect and the Rohingya Conflict,"Bzyl, Claudia Katarzyna","[""d'Hooghe, I.M.A.""]",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The goal of this paper is to give an insight on the complexity issues connected with the role of China in the United Nation’s (UN) action upon the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) principle. The research does so by analyzing the variety of steps undertaken, between August 2017 and February 2019, by the Security Council (SC), General Assembly (GA) and Human Rights Council (HRC), and China’s response to them in the UN in the context of the Rohingya Conflict within the three pillars concept. The Security Council is the most important decision making body in the UN and China has an important role in it as a member of the permanent five (P5). It’s growing importance in the UN and close relationship with Myanmar make it one of the most important actors in the peace process in Rakhine state. Even though China has accepted the R2P concept, it still remains cautious about its influence on the principle of sovereignty. The issue of the principle of sovereignty is often used by China as an narrative against putting more pressure on Myanmar’s government in regards to the Rohingya Conflict. Therefore, undertaking any decisive action by the UNSC under R2P proves to be a complex matter. This research thus agrees with major critiques of the UNSC structure and the R2P principle, which state that the R2P needs more clarification. However, the research also agrees that the R2P has been accepted into the UN as a norm and that China has assumed a key role as a mediator in the Rohingya Conflict using R2P as a narrative supporting its actions.","['Responsibility to Protect (R2P)', 'United Nations(UN)', 'Security Council (SC)', 'China', 'Rohingya', 'Myanmar', 'Rakhine State']"
A Resistance of Normality through Imagery: Queer Aesthetics and Contemporary Queer Photography,"Zhengová, Linda","['Steinbock, Eliza']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on the contemporary queer photography of the artists Zanele Muholi, Momo Okabe, and Zach Blas. More specifically, it examines the role of different theories on gender, queerness, and photography in connection to queer time and space, haptics, affect, and queer opacity. These aesthetic elements are treated as potentially subversive in relation to Gilles Deleuze’s concept of the society of control. The frameworks of both queer and photography theories are employed to analyze the photographs’ formal and political aspects in order to explore their subversive possibilities. My readings and analysis of the photographs suggest that each of these artists deploys aesthetic features as queer tactics to resist the society of control. Additionally, based on the analysis of my own photographic series, Showering with Glasses (2018), I provide an artist’s perspective on possible methods to approach queer aesthetics and the ways in which they might be harnessed as queer tactics. By specifically addressing contemporary queer photography, my hope is to provide insight into what this genre is capable of achieving in the real world.","['archive', 'queer', 'haptics', 'photography', 'affect', 'punctum', 'Roland Barthes', 'Momo Okabe', 'Zach Blas', 'gender', 'Zanele Muholi']"
The War on Drugs in the United States: Drugs as an instrument to securitize racial minorities (1875-1937),"Kraan, Tibor Jonathan Emile","['Fulo Regilme Jr., Santino']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, the background of the modern War on Drugs in the United States is explained. Guided by the research question: ‘’How did the American Elites in the United States use the existential threat of drugs to securitize racial minorities between 1873 and 1938?’’, this thesis is written. By analyzing 12 articles of the New York Times, guided by the principles of the social constructivism and securitization, the thesis tries to prove racist motives in the War on Drugs. Between 1875 and 1937, three populations have been subject of racism, with drugs as an excuse to hide these racist motives. By linking opiates to the Chinese population, the American Elites found an excuse to discriminate the Chinese population by means of drugs legislation between 1875 and 1900. Shortly after, crack cocaine was heavily illegalised, since it could be linked to the Black population using it. From the 1920's on, Mexicans and Marijuana were closely framed together, before Marijuana legislation passed in Congress. This thesis proves that a collaboration between the New York Times and powerful actors in the United States resulted rather in a war on race instead of a War on Drugs.","['History', 'United States', 'Drugs', 'Race', 'Racism', 'Securitization', 'New York Times', 'Social Constructivism']"

Of je worst lust: Een onderzoek naar transparantie als journalistieke norm en het correctiebeleid op nieuwsredacties,"Jong, Eline de","['Pleijter, Alexander']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Thema: Een wekelijkse mail van de hoofdredacteur, het vermelden van informatie over de auteur bij een artikel en de precieze tijd van publicatie, verantwoordingskaders, correctienaschriften, ‘wie-zijn-we- en-wat-doen-we’-statements, ‘over ons’-rubrieken en ombudslieden die in de arm worden genomen: het zijn allemaal inspanningen vanuit de journalistiek om het publiek inzicht te geven in de totstandkoming van nieuws. Inspanningen omwille van transparantie. En uiteindelijk, inspanningen omwille van vertrouwen - door het publiek ervan te verzekeren dat de journalistieke organisatie in kwestie de kwaliteit van haar werk openlijk waarborgt. Maar wat behelst transparantie in de journalistiek precies? Waarom is het belangrijk en hoe moet dat worden vormgegeven? En hoe wordt een visie op transparantie vertaald naar de manier waarop redacties fouten corrigeren? Methode: Om antwoord te krijgen op deze vragen zijn semi-gestructureerde interviews gehouden met twaalf hoofdredacteuren van landelijke nieuwsmedia; het zijn immers de hoofdredacties die het beleid van een nieuwsredactie bepalen. Resultaten: Uit deze gesprekken is gebleken dat alle geïnterviewde hoofdredacteuren transparantie in de journalistiek beschouwen als de bereidheid om verantwoording af te leggen over het eigen werk. Een deel van de hoofdredacteuren is van mening dat transparantie daarmee een belangrijke rol vervult als het gaat om de geloofwaardigheid onder het publiek; een ander deel is ervan overtuigd dat transparantie daar geen wezenlijke invloed op heeft. Op basis van de gevoerde gesprekken is een typologie ontwikkeld van de drie vormen die transparantie in de journalistiek in de praktijk kan aannemen: 1) proactieve transparantie: openheid, 2) anticiperende transparantie: waarmerking, en 3) reactieve transparantie: verantwoording. Het openlijk corrigeren van fouten valt onder de laatste vorm van transparantie. Volgens de hoofdredacteuren is transparantie over een fout en de correctie daarvan geboden wanneer de fout 1) een inhoudelijke impact heeft, 2) een risico vormt voor de geloofwaardigheid, en 3) schade toebrengt aan derden.","['Journalistiek', 'transparantie', 'correctiebeleid']"
Imagining Colonial Community: The Construction of Indigenous Intermediaries and Limitations of Assimilation in Colonial French-Senegal (1852-1906),"Janssens, Yorik","['Augusteijn, Joost']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Assimilation in colonial African history has often been studied as an active policy. Recent literature has argued that assimilation was instead far more limited and complicated, especially in the case of French-Senegal. This thesis therefore examines cultural assimilation as a rhetorical tool rather than as a directly implemented idea, asking: did the French colonial government in Senegal, between 1852 and 1906, consciously implement assimilation processes with the intended purpose of stimulating the general acceptance of French identity in local indigenous groups, or were there other factors involved? A precursory analysis of how the métis of the Four Communes self-gallicised into French mercantile and cultural intermediaries frames the complex historical situation of French-Senegal. The centuries-long public disinterest towards imperial affairs that the métis experienced resulted in certain freedoms, which they used to construct themselves as French intermediaries over a long period of time. This directly contrasts the short-term adjustments to the indigenous status quo undergone by the Toucouleurs of Futa Toro in the late-19th century, after decades of direct and indirect conflict with the French. This paper provides a more complete picture of how assimilation evolved, was viewed, and significantly more limited than 19th and early-20th century ideological rhetoric suggests. Limited intermediary construction emerges instead as the colonial government’s main policy to ensure long-term stability in newly acquired interior regions, imperial competition with other European powers being a key catalyst. While the colonial government did attempt a few instances of direct assimilation, the budgetary and logistical difficulties of enforcing the acceptance of French civilization indicate that this was not in colonial interest. Policy was instead driven to construct effective intermediaries, which allowed the government to focus on the larger issues it had to deal with. This is connected to the initial war against the jihadi Toucouleur Empire, and the continuing threat that both it and its leaders represented. The Toucouleur Empire had control over a significant swath of West Africa, and the ruling Tall dynasty that claimed those territories was a problem for French colonial ambitions. In addition, the predominantly Islamic indigenous group was highly resistant to foreign Europeans, making assimilation all the more difficult and unlikely in the long run. Due to the demands of imperial competition, the French sought to undermine the Toucouleur Empire, and the Tall dynasty that held sway over it. This was successful, in part thanks to manipulation of the geopolitical situation through treaties with local indigenous chiefs and arming Toucouleur rivals - with indigenous geopolitics playing a significant role on its own in causing the decline of the Toucouleur Empire. The colonial government seized Futa Toro in 1890, forcing the Tall dynasty into exile. The years that followed and the policies implemented further suggest that assimilation was limited in French-Senegal, largely relegated to rhetoric that exaggerated events to fit into unrealistic ideological expectations. A form of limited intermediary construction was emphasised instead, as seen in source description of Islamic policies, which sought to restrict the movement of Muslim preachers and curtail the influence of Islam. Due to the cultural importance of the Islamic faith in Futa Toro, this policy intended to favour French civilization as a replacement – but was unsuccessful. This shows the difficulties that the colonial government encountered when it did attempt to enforce the widespread acceptance of French civilization, and by extension identity, in indigenous groups. Information-gathering practises through 19th century military expeditions also highlight that the colonial government was in no position to extensively consolidate French identity in the region. The French had to acquire as much information about local affairs as possible, so that effective policies could be enacted within budgetary restrictions – which they used to guide the writing of treaties. This is tied to the power wielded by the Tall dynasty, which originated from established Islamic traditions such as the hajj. The French, through information-gathering practises, were well aware of these traditions, and sought to limit the ability for the clerical elite to rebel effectively against them in the long-term. The eventual restriction of the hajj was subsequently enacted through enforced treaty terms, ensuring that indigenous elite children would acquire a predominantly French-education. Yet even in these schools, they were able to speak their own language outside of class and attend Qur’anic schools. This was done so that the ruling elite would be gallicised enough to never question colonial rule, yet not French enough to be able to identify themselves as such in any meaningful way – potentially unable to act as effective leaders and intermediaries in their respective communities as a result. Even this process was complicated by conflicting interpretations of assimilation between colonial missionaries and officials, relating to assimilation’s conceptual connection to the European civilizing mission. This thesis therefore concludes that the French colonial government in Senegal, between 1852 and 1906, certainly talked about assimilation in a way that implied they had consciously implemented assimilation processes with the intended purpose of stimulating the general acceptance of French identity in local indigenous groups. Other factors show that this was not the historical reality, however. The colonial government was not able to apply direct assimilation to the same ideological extent as rhetoric portrayed. Rather, over the span of several decades and due to budgetary restrictions, the government focused on applying pragmatic long-term solutions to ensure public order and stability. This conclusion was driven by theoretical and methodological considerations. To ensure that colonial perspectives remained firmly fixed in their context, this thesis was written using a social imaginary approach, permitting this paper to speak more objectively to what occurred within colonial conversations. Importantly, this avoids the assumption that a ‘superior’ civilisation was dictating the terms of interaction in West Africa.

The Ruining of an Empire: On the Causes of the Marinid Decline,"Sanderse, Daan","['Gewald, Jan-Bart']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis is an attempt to place the decline of the Marinid Empire in a wider perspective, in order to gain a better understanding of the causes of the decline. Although long considered to be a weak and ineffective polity in modern historiography, the Marinid Empire was perhaps one of the wealthiest polities of the medieval world. By controlling and facilitating the Trans-Saharan trade networks, the Marinids had access to the largest source of gold in their time, which enabled them to become an important regional polity. Their relative short reign and quick collapse however, cast a shadow over their legacy. But what caused their collapse? This thesis focused on the influence of the Black Death and its possible causative role in the decline of the Trans-Saharan gold trade. By doing so, a series of interesting correlations emerge that suggest that there is a causative relation between the arrival of the Black Death in West Africa, the decline of the Trans Saharan gold trade in the late 14th century and the Marinid decline itself.","['Marinids', 'Black Death', 'North Africa', 'African history', 'Morocco', 'Mali Empire', 'Trans Saharan trade', 'Medieval history']"
The relative universality of the right to respect for family life,"Graaf, Myrthe van der","['Oster, Jan']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"By conducting socio-legal research comprised of an internal legal doctrinal approach and an external moral approach, this thesis analyses the extent to which the EU is obligated to enact legislation on the recognition of same-sex legal relationships from a legal and moral dimension. The internal legal doctrinal approach locates and analyses the ECtHR’s case law and explicates three legal doctrines demonstrating the ECtHR’s interpretive ethic. This thesis will use the necessary flexibility provided by the legal doctrines to develop and improve the interpretation of the ECHR in order to safeguard the universal enjoyment of the right to respect for family life under Article 8 of the ECHR. The external moral approach illustrates the underlying heteronormative structures of society and the institutionalised system of law within the frameworks of constructivism and queer theory. Following the internal legal doctrinal and external moral approach, this thesis shows discrepancies between law in theory and law in practice and presents reconstructive recommendations in line with legal and social reality to solve these discrepancies. It provides compelling arguments and justifiable means for the ECtHR to broaden the notion of family life within the meaning of Article 8 to include marital same-sex legal relationships, thereby extending the positive obligation flowing from Article 8 with the aim of improving the substantive rights of same-sex couples in the EU and to safeguard the universal enjoyment of Article 8.","['human rights', 'same-sex legal relationships', 'Article 8 ECHR', 'private international law', 'legal doctrines']"

Milieuvernietiging of Economische kansen,"Hart, Lynn de","['Jungslager, Francisca']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Nederlandse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Wanneer een thema belangrijk wordt in de maatschappij of de media moeten alle politieke partijen daar een standpunt over vormen. Vaak is er één partij die door de stemmers als autoriteit op dit gebied wordt gezien; deze partij heeft dit issue geclaimd. Als andere partijen stemmen willen winnen, moeten ze ownership krijgen over dit issue. Een van dit soort issues is het klimaat. GroenLinks heeft voor dit issue de confirmation bias van de kiezers. De VVD heeft geen issue ownership en moet zijn eigen spin geven aan het issue om zich dit onderwerp te kunnen toe-eigenen. Een manier om een eigen draai te geven aan een onderwerp is om framing te gebruiken. Frames geven een context aan een onderwerp en zorgen ervoor dat een abstract onderwerp concreet wordt. Op deze manier kunnen frames het denkkader van de lezer of hoorder van een boodschap beïnvloeden. Framing is dus uitermate geschikt om te gebruiken in persuasieve teksten. Een voorbeeld van een persuasieve tekst is een verkiezingsprogramma. Politieke partijen brengen voor een verkiezingsperiode hun standpunten naar buiten via de verkiezingsprogramma’s. In deze documenten staan alle standpunten over de verschillende issues uitgewerkt. Deze teksten zijn informatief, maar ook persuasief, omdat ze de lezer willen overtuigen om te gaan stemmen op de betreffende partij. In deze verkiezingsprogramma’s kunnen partijen dus een poging wagen om zich een issue toe te eigenen wanneer ze deze nog niet bezitten en als het in hun voordeel lijkt om het wel te bezitten. Aangezien de VVD een standpunt moet hebben over het issue ‘klimaat’ en hier nog geen ownership over heeft, is de kans groot dat er in het verkiezingsprogramma een poging gedaan wordt tot het toe-eigenen van dit issue. Deze scriptie geeft antwoord op de onderzoeksvraag: Met behulp van welke frames probeert een rechtse partij, zoals de VVD, zich het issue ‘klimaat’ toe te eigenen en af te pakken van een conventioneel groene partij, zoals GroenLinks? Om deze vraag te kunnen beantwoorden moet eerst een deelvraag beantwoord worden: Met behulp van welke frames heeft GroenLinks het issue ‘klimaat’ geclaimd? Met behulp van de inductieve analyse van Van Gorp (2007, 2010) zijn er voor elke partij drie dominante frames uit de klimaatpassages van de twee verkiezingsprogramma’s gehaald. GroenLinks benut het bewegingsframe, het verantwoordelijkheidsframe en het (drugs)verslavingsframe. De VVD geeft een eigen draai aan het issue ‘klimaat’ door gebruik te maken van het economische-kansenframe, het eenvoudsframe en het strijdframe. Door deze traditioneel rechtse en liberale thema’s waar de VVD bekend om staat, te gebruiken voor een nieuw issue, geeft de VVD een nieuw perspectief op het issue ‘klimaat’. Ook de VVD benut het bewegingsframe dat dominant is in het verkiezingsprogramma van GroenLinks. Dit wordt gedaan omdat zowel GroenLinks als de VVD allebei verandering in het huidige beleid willen. Door middel van het bewegingsframe uiten ze dit in hun verkiezingsprogramma’s.","['framing', 'klimaatbeleid', 'milieubeleid', 'holian', 'van gorp', 'issue ownership', 'vvd', 'groenlinks']"

Public-Private Partnerships in Kenya: A Case Study on the Socio-Economic Impacts of SNV Projects on Smallholder Farmers,"Akerboom, Alexander","['Akinyoade, Akinyinka']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This master thesis attempted to research the kinds of socio-economic dynamics of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) on rural communities in Kenya. To do this, the Kenyan branch of the SNV Netherlands Development Organisation hosted me to analyse the impacts of three SNV-initiated PPP projects focusing on the fields of agriculture, dairy and water management. Research was conducted directly in the field by interviewing twenty different smallholder farmers who are using products or services of one of the five different analysed SNV business partners taking part in the PPP projects. The history of PPPs in Africa and particularly Kenya was summarised while simultaneously elaborating as to why PPPs are an increasingly more prevalent means of development in the country. My methodology was then outlined including information about the relevant Kenyan counties and the different SNV PPPs and business partners. The results of the twenty different interviews were then detailed and critically discussed showing the strengths and shortcomings of the collected data while highlighting key findings. It was found that the farmers I interviewed were primarily very pleased with the products and services they were using through SNV’s PPP projects, being fairly hesitant in sharing any critiques or points of improvement. Upon further analysis this could have been due to shortcomings in my methodology meaning that it is important to always critically evaluate gathered qualitative data before coming to a definitive conclusion since various unintended consequences could still negatively impact rural communities even though interviewed farmers remain positive. For future research there is room for improvement by looking into different factors that may introduce bias into data gathering, requiring adjustments to the methodology, as well as increasing the sample size of conducted interviews. Additionally, future interviews should include questions about specific quantitative figures in order to have a clear manner to measure changes in production and income.",['Public Private Partnerships Kenya SNV']

"Unshakeable Inequality? The State, the Media and the Construction of Gender in Japan","Lennox, Adam","['Mes, Thomas']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The objectification of women is explored in the writings of Bourdieu. Bourdieu claims that “the social world constructs the body as a sexually defined reality and as the depository of sexually defining principles of vision and division” (2001, 11). Within this structure, society categorises its constructions of gender, with ‘masculine domination’ used to outline those constructions (Ibid.). Bourdieu further argues that “things and activities” receive their objective value when they are juxtaposed in relation to their “homologous [opposite]” (Ibid., 7). This can be applied to social gender dynamics in which men hold power and women act out gender stereotypical and unequal activities. For example, regarding workplace customs in Japan, men are preferred for long-term positions whilst women often fulfil temporary, lesser valued roles (Goff 1995, 1153). Bourdieu's theorisation of female objectification and gender hierarchy may be applied to the social constructions of gender in Japan and their reinforcement through institutions of power. This helps to understand the link between pornography and gender inequality which the thesis argues, must be challenged at state level. Applying Bourdieu’s theory, pornography may be seen as a system to serve ‘male domination’ and pornographic media as an instrument to reinforce and reflect the wider problem of institutionalised gender inequality in Japan. The irony to be explored in this, and the following two chapters, is that the institutions of the Japanese state themselves propagate gender inequality, whilst simultaneously blaming issues of gender inequality on marginalised groups, such as the Otaku – discussed in Chapter 3. Pornography itself is also blamed. An example is the case of Yoshimoto, where after being arrested for rape, police officer Yoshimoto claimed: “I bought and got aroused by pornographic videos with a rape theme, and could not control my compulsion. I feel sorry for the victims” (Shibata 2008, 12). This agent of the state diverted blame away from both himself and the structures of the state, as if neither it, nor he had any responsibility for this victimisation of women.","['Inequality', 'Objectification', 'Obscenity', 'Blame', 'Pornography', 'Law', 'Workplace']"

Intelligibility of Papiamentu among Native Speakers of Spanish and Portuguese,"Jonker, Amarens","['Parafita Couto, Maricarmen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Latijns-Amerikastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Previous studies (Jensen, 1989) (Börestam Uhlmann, 1994) (Zeevaert, 2004) (Gooskens et al., 2018) have attempted to establish intelligibility between cognate or sister languages - languages descending from a common ancestral language. But what happens to intelligibility when those languages are not only related but are a direct continuation such as descendant languages or a creoles? This thesis attempts to establish the intelligibility of Papiamentu as an Iberian-based creole language among native speakers of Spanish and Portuguese. By means of a cloze test (Aitken, 1977) performed online and distributed through social media, participants were asked to look at three written texts and listen to three audio fragments, each with certain words missing for which the participants had to select replacements through multiple choice. Participants were sorted into different categories in order to establish whether the order of performed tasks had any impact on the end results. Additionally, participants were asked to self-assess their performance at the end of each task. Results showed that Spanish speakers generally performed better at the reading task, while Portuguese speaking participants scored better during the listening task. Overall, the Portuguese speakers had the highest scores. The order in which tasks were performed also impacted the scores, with those who performed the listening task first scoring higher than those who performed the tasks in the reversed order.","['INTELLIGIBILITY', 'CREOLE', 'PAPIAMENTU', 'PORTUGUESE', 'SPANISH']"

Brazil’s Agricultural South-South Cooperation with Mozambique: Building Capacity or Creating Dependency?,"Scharwies, Daniel Ulrich","['Amann, Edmund']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In light of Africa’s gradual integration into the global market economy, the continent has increasingly attracted international investments from the emerging economies, in particular Brazil and China, since the early 2000s. Since Africa has a rich historical past related to colonialism, exploitation of and subordination to the global North, these developments question the potential of these new, dominant players in Africa to break with this vicious cycle of dependency on dominant economies. As Latin America’s strongest economy by nominal gross domestic product (GDP), Brazil’s growing cooperation with the African continent is therefore raising the question of the country’s economic and political intentions behind its South-South Cooperation (SSC) projects. Formerly regarded as a promoter of cooperation between Southern countries by the African community, Brazil’s shift in foreign policy towards economic pragmatism is now viewed as a double-edged sword. While extensive academic research has focused on China’s role in accessing these new markets, less work has looked at Brazil’s underlying intentions behind its SSC projects. In fact, Brazil’s leading agricultural SSC project in Mozambique, the ProSAVANA project, has sparked a public and academic debate about the implications of Brazil’s cooperation for its Southern partners. The hypothesis of this thesis therefore argues that since president Luiz Inácio ‘Lula’ da Silva’s rise to power in 2003, Brazil uses SSC as a tool to strengthen its economic and political influence on Sub-Saharan Africa and to diversify its economy, while subordinating the local markets to Brazil’s economic activities, hence reproducing the dependency theory. In order to confirm this hypothesis, the following research question will be central to the discussion of this thesis: How does Brazil’s agricultural South-South Cooperation with Sub-Saharan Africa, with a focus on the ProSAVANA project in Mozambique, reproduce the dependency theory?","['Brazil', 'South-South Cooperation', 'Dependency Theory', 'Mozambique', 'ProSAVANA']"

Print News and Panic during the 1799 Insurrection in the Midi Toulousain,"McMillan Summons, Charles","['Laborie, Lionel', 'Broers, Michael']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Newspapers reveal much more than the facts reported within them. They illustrate revolutionary culture and the climate of ideas which faced readers. Understanding this is crucial to imagining how people experienced the daily reality of living through such times. Newspapers during the Directory period have seldom been studied. This is a particular lacuna given the crisis and unexpected chaos of the summer of 1799. By mid-1799, multiple military fronts as well as internal unrest backgrounded the beginning of the royalist rebellion in the Haute-Garonne. The way in which the press characterised this royalist threat and communicated the crisis discloses much about what editors, and in turn their readership, were afraid of happening. Editors relied on collective memories of the horrors of the Terror to characterise opposing political factions thereby demonstrating fears of repeating the recent past. Contrasting this dire rhetoric and the extreme demonisation of the rebels with actual indifferent government attitude to the insurrection illustrates that this was merely a form of propaganda employed for political ends by the Jacobin, royalist, and republican political movements. In the same vein, the post-rebellion manipulation of the depiction of peasant rebels once again establishes that these words were more motivated by political needs than by reality. This reveals an underlying anxiety from a Directory whose control over France was steadily eroding.","['France', 'French Revolution', 'Press', 'Midi', 'Representation of Crisis', 'Newspaper Culture', 'Europaeum']"
"Identity, Social Inclusion and Progression: a comparative study of Somalis migrating to the UK from Somalia and the Netherlands","Websdale, Asher","['Glynn, Irial']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study aimed to explore the differences in self-perceived identities, perceptions of social inclusion and perceptions of social progression of Somali-born migrants entering and residing in the UK. The study focuses on whether these differences exist depending on whether migrants arrive from the Netherlands, a Member State of the European Union (EU), or whether they arrive directly from Somalia, a nation outside of the EU. Literature concerned with Somalis residing in the UK, as well as specific literature focusing on Somalis leaving the Netherlands to migrate to the UK was used to contextualise the study. The research consisted of 18 face-to-face interviews carried in the UK: 10 interviews with individuals who arrived from Somalia and 8 with those that arrived from the Netherlands. Based on the data collected from these interviews, self-perceived identities between the two groups largely differ. Those arriving from the Netherlands typically disassociate from their Somali identity. Secondly, formulations of identity play a pivotal role in perceptions of social inclusion and social progression. On arrival those arriving from the Netherlands perceive themselves to be more socially included and have higher prospects of progressing in society. In terms of how these factors change over time, few conclusions could be drawn – though it appears that differences in country of arrival may become less important. Nevertheless, Somalis residing in the UK from both groups hold positive perceptions of how they are progressing in society.","['Migration', 'Somalis', 'Somalia', 'United Kingdom', 'Social Capital', 'Social Inclusion', 'Social Progression', 'Identity', 'Secondary Movement', 'Interviews', 'Netherlands']"

The last decade has been a period overshadowed by a variety of crises, from immigration crises to financial crises. This has raised criticism, demanding to reconsider the current development paradigm. The rational of development through economic growth cannot be maintained, particularly due to our planets’ boundaries. We have exhausted our planets limits and are steering towards its tipping point. This paper will look at the Ecuadorian case of Sumak Kawsay, a variant of Buen Vivir which, has been an increasingly popular worldview in the Andean and Amazon region of Latin America. This paper will explore Buen Vivir as an alternative development strategy and critically assess its viability to achieve a set of three distinct UN sustainable development goals. Additionally, the current global political economy will be critically discussed.

The nation and the antique market: An analysis on the influence on the Chinese art market,"Fogelberg, David","['Wang, Jue']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Chinese art and antiques market is to a large extent influenced by nationalism. In contrast to other governments, the Chinese government is not very successful in the repatriation of Chinese cultural heritage. Therefore, it supports individuals to do so by rewarding those who step in. Nationalism nowadays is a very important value in Chinese society encouraged by the government. Part of that is also to encourage people to show their nationalism by means of buying art. Donors are also encouraged by the rewards they get for their donations. When an object that has been stolen from China comes up for sale it always attracts a lot of attention in China. This is especially the case when it originates from the Yuanmingyuan, a place connected to the humiliation of China. Many think the sale of stolen objects should be forbidden and if the government does not succeed in stopping the sale, people will try to buy it in order to repatriate it to China. Which can result in a bidding war in which the price reaches unrealistic heights. Individuals outside of mainland have used antiques to construct their Chinese identity and to strengthen their ties with China by among others donating stolen art. This is a way for them to show they support Chinese nationalism. Something that has had an influence on the buying behaviour of the overseas on the Chinese art and antique market. Since the beginning of the 2000s buyers from mainland China with the same purpose have entered the market. This has had an enormous influence on the Chinese art and antiques market. Thus, the Chinese art and antique market is to a large extent influenced by nationalism.","['Chinese art', 'art', 'art market', 'international politics', 'museum', 'nationalism', 'patriotism', 'china foreign policy', 'colonial art', 'stolen art']"

It also gave an overview of the historical and political situation of the two Koreas by looking at the inter-Korean relations through South Korea’s foreign policies. The second chapter discussed the literature review on film theories, including the narrative theory of Roland Barthes and the theory of realism, used in the analysis. In addition, the methodology explained how the research is conducted. Lastly, the third chapter was dedicated to the case studies analysis and the related discussion. In this study it was discovered that the representation of North Korea changed throughout the years. These changes often corresponded to the political and social situation experienced in reality.","['Korean cinema', 'blockbuster movies', 'portrayal', 'policies']"

Impose or teach AI moral intelligence?,"Oei, Timo","['Sleutels, Jan']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper considers the morality that comes with the actions of autonomous AI-systems (AAA). AAA are becoming more autonomous and more intelligent every day, and are already part of our daily lives in the form of decision support tools, all sorts of apps, or even self-driving cars and that is why they need a moral compass. Currently, implementing a moral compass into AAA is problematic since the current strategies, laws, principles, guidelines and moral codes do not suffice for solving the moral challenges that surround AAA and impact human lives. Two strategies are considered: Top-Down (TD) and Bottom-Up (BU) strategies. TD strategies use explicit rules that are programmed into AAA, and AAA are designed to follow these rules. BU strategies allow AAA to teach themselves the correct behaviour using feedback from the evaluation of their actions. The problems with TD strategies are that situational dilemmas require almost infinite lists of rules which account for every possible factor, and that a shorter set of rules will result in definitions that are too vague to be eligible for implementation in practise. The problems with BU strategies are that they provide limited transparency of the actions and reasoning behind these actions, and that it becomes harder to evaluate AAA’s moral compass. Furthermore, additional problems come with the moral compass of AAA. Understanding how to emulate the relevant human factors in the moral compass of AAA is difficult, and the moral compass of AAA should adapt to the changing and subjective moral compass of humans over time. This paper concludes that, currently, both TD and BU strategies for implementing a moral compass into AAA prove to be problematic, and that proper evaluation of AAA is difficult. Additionally, the moral compass of AAA becomes more problematic because the programmed moral compass differs from human reasoning and actions.","['AI', 'morality', 'responsibility', 'moral compass', 'robots', 'implementation problems']"

Digital ICT and State Legitimacy in China,"Keil, Sebastian","['Choi, Nan']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The question of how technology and the state interact is arguably one of the most pressing issues in contemporary scholarship across disciplines. The rise of digital ICT infuses the debate with hopes that the network technology can be a key in breaking down the rigid, hierarchical structures of authoritarian states. On the other side, dystopian thinkers fear that the technology will add a powerful device to the toolkit of dictators and oppressors around the world. This paper seeks to gain insights on how technology and the state relate by examining the influence of digital ICT on state legitimacy in China. It analyses the phenomenology of a specific linguistic code which developed in China’s online communities and seeks explanatory models to show how this digital discourse challenges the hegemony of the Communist Party of China (CCP). To gain a grip on this complex issue, a theoretical model is developed on the basis of ideas which were developed by Gramsci and Habermas. This model is integrated with findings of the literature review, which aims to isolate essentialist notions and flaws in the cyberutopian and dystopian views and conceptually move beyond them. This paper builds upon the work of scholars like Guobin Yang and Min Jiang, who developed the thesis of dialectic coevolution. This view integrates critiques from the other viewpoints, while acknowledging the socio-economic, economic and cultural developments which are specific to China. This paper is an attempt to combine the key insights from this view, a theoretical model for analysis and analysis itself. It utilizes an inter-disciplinary approach to explain how hegemonic meanings are negotiated in the digital realm in China.",

Een onderzoek naar het gebruik van frames bij Greenpeace Nederland,"Vorm, Daphne van der","['Jungslager, Francisca']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Nederlandse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Abstract Greenpeace probeert met zijn campagnes problemen aan te kaarten bij het grote publiek en te stimuleren tot duurzame oplossingen. Greenpeace doet dit door gebruik te maken van overtuigende teksten zoals wervingsteksten en teksten van meer informatieve aard waarbij er gefocust wordt op het geven van achtergrondinformatie. In beide typen teksten wordt er gebruik gemaakt van het middel framing. Dit houdt in dat bepaalde aspecten sterker worden belicht dan andere aspecten en dat heeft invloed op de interpretatie van de tekst (Gagestein, 2015: 53). Greenpeace schrijft zowel wervende teksten als informatieve teksten over dezelfde onderwerpen. Het doel van deze twee types teksten is anders. Wervende teksten richten zich bovenal op het overtuigen van de lezer terwijl bij informatieve teksten het gaat om informeren. Op basis van de verschillende tekstdoelen zou je je kunnen afvragen of dit van invloed is op de manier waarop er gebruik wordt gemaakt van frames. In dit onderzoek is onderzocht of er een verschil is in het gebruik van frames tussen wervingsteksten en informatieve teksten. Dit wordt onderzocht door in kaart te brengen welke frames er in beide teksttypes aanwezig zijn en door de resultaten met elkaar te vergelijken. Het corpus is geanalyseerd met behulp van onderzoeken van Van Gorp (2006 & 2007) en Joris e.a. (2015). Het corpus bestaat uit tien teksten, waarvan vijf wervende teksten en vijf informatieve teksten. Steeds twee teksten horen bij één onderwerp (één wervende tekst en één informatieve tekst). De behandelde onderwerpen in dit onderzoek zijn: plastic, vlees, olie, klimaatakkoord en de zuidpool. De eerste verwachting is dat het type frames dat voorkomt in wervingsteksten krachtiger is dan het type frames dat voorkomt in informatieve teksten. De tweede verwachting is dat een deel van de gevonden frames in zowel de wervingstekst als de informatieve tekst voorkomt, omdat ze zijn terug te brengen op de visie van Greenpeace. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat er aanwijzingen zijn dat er krachtigere frames worden ingezet bij wervingsteksten dan bij meer informatieve teksten, maar ook dat er aanwijzingen zijn dat er even krachtige frames worden ingezet in wervingsteksten als in meer informatieve teksten. Ook is gebleken dat alle onderzochte onderwerpen als overeenkomst hadden dat een deel van de gevonden frames in beide teksttypes werd teruggevonden. De uitkomsten van de verwachtingen kunnen alleen nog niet generaliseerd worden, omdat dit onderzoek indicatief van aard is.",
Het belang van de firma Goupil voor de aquarellen van de Haagsche School. Een analyse van de verkoopboeken van aquarellen 1870 - 1900,"Hakuno, Akiko","['Boers, M.E.W.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Dutch Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In de tweede helft van de negentiende eeuw stonden Nederlandse levende kunstenaars alsmede hun schilderijen enorm in de belangstelling, zowel in Nederland als daarbuiten. Als de vraag vooral naar de werken van de Haagse School-schilders vergrootte, speelden kunsthandelaren een belangrijke rol om deze kunstenaars en hun kunst in contact te brengen met potentiële kopers. Waterverf was een geliefde techniek van de schilders van de Haagse School. Terwijl deze schilders veel waterverfschilderijen produceerden, is er relatief weinig onderzoek naar de handel in aquarellen gedaan. In deze scriptie wordt nader onderzoek verricht naar de markt voor aquarellen. Wat kan er worden gezegd over de afzet en de handel in de eigentijdse, Nederlandse aquarellen in de laatste decennia van de negentiende eeuw, met nadruk op die van de Haagse School-schilder? Dit onderzoek wordt gebaseerd op de verkoopboeken van het Haagse filiaal van de Franse kunsthandel Goupil, waarin de dagregisters van de aquarellen gevonden kunnen worden. Bovendien beperkt deze studie zich tot volgende kunstenaars: J. Israëls, J. en W. Maris, A. Mauve, J. H. Weissenbruch en F.J. van Rossum du Chattel in de periode 1870-1900. In dit werkstuk worden aantallen, in- en verkoopprijzen, onderwerpen, kopers en verkopers van de door Goupil verhandelde aquarellen van de geselecteerde kunstschilders geanalyseerd. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat de handel van de aquarellen bij Goupil tijdens 1870-1900 net zo actief was als die van de olieverfschilderijen. Vooral in het laatste decennium van de negentiende eeuw leverde de firma de meeste winst op ondanks het kleinste aantal van de verhandelde aquarellen en de stijgende concurrentie met andere handelaren. Met behulp van een betaalbare prijs, ontwikkelden de aquarellen zich tot een populair verzamelobject voor het kopende publiek. Dit onderzoek reflecteert een aspect van het totaalbeeld van de afzet van de aquarellen in de periode 1870-1900.","['De Haagse School', '19e eeuwse Nederlandse kunst', 'Goupil', 'Aquarellen', 'Kunsthandel']"

"Persuasive political rhetoric in Scottish popular print, 1707-1736","Prenen, Beryl","['Augusteijn, Joost']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyses the use of persuasive rhetorical styles within the political discourse that was present in the popular prints of early eighteenth century Scotland. Using Aristotle’s rhetorical schemata of logos, pathos and ethos as a tool for textual analysis, this thesis demonstrates how Whig, Tory and Jacobite agents used the medium of popular print to endorse their own political ideologies as well as undermining those of their opponents from the Act of Union of 1707 until the Porteous affair of 1736. About twenty percent of the popular prints that constitute this thesis’ corpus of sources, were found to contain political notions corresponding to the contemporary party lines. Within these prints, Whigs were found to appeal to logos for factual representation and amplification, but primarily made use of the pathos of graciousness to portray themselves as righteous. The appeal to this emotion was supported by a virtuous ethos that focused on characterizations such as goodness, honesty and grace. Contrarily, Tories and Jacobites hardly made use of logos but instead appealed to a range of emotions within the concept of pathos, such as gentleness and pity, and ascribed themselves an ethos that included bravery, valance and loyalty. In undermining the opposition, both Whig as well as Tory and Jacobite prints vilify the opponent through the pathos of anger, hatred, enmity and contempt. However, it is in the undermining where ethos becomes the main means of persuasion. Tories are described as incompetent, Jacobites are characterized as barbarous fools, and Whigs as conceiting and self-serving politicians. Consequently, Whigs typically sought to portray themselves as morally and ethically superior to their opponents and their readership, whereas Jacobites seemingly sought to identify with their readership more, emphasizing how everyone was suffering under the Whig government. This thesis outlines the persuasive content of a political discourse that was present within a type of print available to both high and low culture. With this, it argues that political discussion was not strictly reserved for intelligentsia, although it also sustains the assumption that ephemeral print was generally used as a trivial news agent. Ass well as this, this thesis provides two relative novelties. First, it constructs an explicit and restricting definition of the concept 'popular', unlike most academic publications on this concept that apply the term without restrictions. Second, it offers a series of perspectives on the content of a previously unstudied corpus of ephemeral prints published in early eighteenth century Scotland, which is both a period and area that has been understudied with regards to the role of politics in popular print culture.","['Scotland', 'Scottish print', 'popular print', 'persuasive rhetoric', 'eighteenth century', 'print culture', 'print']"

Evaluating Peer Education in Cambodia: Why peer education regarding HIV and Sexual Health has been ineffective for female sex and entertainment workers in Cambodia,"Hawcroft, Harry","['Rizal, Shidiq']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Encompassed by ambiguity, the effectiveness of peer-education has yet to be systematically evaluated despite its prevalent usage worldwide. However, research has shown that the success of peer education is predominately influenced via the reciprocate of peer education and the environmental context where peer education is being implemented. In regards to the environment, it further dictates that peer education is more effective where there is a persistent social capital. In this context, social capital is defined as the cultural components that facilitate trust and public support within a designated space, community or country. This study aims to investigate whether the failure of HIV and sexual health orientated peer education programs in Cambodia were due to the organisations that were implementing peer education or whether the social fabric that exists in Cambodia is currently incompatible with peer education. This thesis builds upon an existing theoretical framework in order to determine why peer education regarding HIV and Sexual Health has been ineffective for female sex and entertainment workers in Cambodia. Based on a review of three case studies, two of which are in Cambodia and a comparable case study from India, the analysis suggests that the failure of peer education programs lays with the organisations as opposed to the country’s social fabric. In response to this investigation, I recommend that Cambodia specific alterations should be used to enhance the effectiveness of future peer education programs in Cambodia.","['Peer Education', 'Cambodia', 'HIV']"

Alternative Development Based on Extractivism - The Way out of Dependency?,"Merx, Ariane","['Valdivia Rivera, Soledad']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The thesis examines the successes and limitations of Evo Morales's alternative model of development called ""Vivir Bien"" and how the need for alternative development arose in the first place. Therefore, it expounds the country's trajectory towards dependence on the export of primary resources and the deteriorating effects that development models conceived in the global North and applied in the global South, particularly in Bolivia, had. Evo Morales assumed presidency in 2006 with the promise of overcoming the primary-resource-exports dependency and centering development around local needs, stressing indigenous knowledge and a communitarian lifestyle. His proposal is formulated in the so-called Plan Nacional de Desarrollo, which was issued in 2007. In order to overcome extractivism and raw materials exports, however, the Morales administration suggests to utilize the very extractivism to generate the capital needed to industrialize the extractive sectors and to later diversify the economy. However, the industrialization levels have not increased, and neither has the economy shown notable signs of diversification, on the contrary. As extractivism is a self-reinforcing activity, it does not weaken ties of dependency, does not improve the extracting country's position in the world economy or promote autonomy in the global capitalist system. Further on, extractivism under Morales has led to clashes with the population that Evo Morales supposedly caters to in particular - the indigenous and peasant communities. Therefore, extractivism is not suited to drive alternative development because it contradicts too strongly with a goal of development that takes into account local needs. In fact, it reinforces ties of dependency to the capitalist center and neglects the aspect of citizen participation in political processes.","['(neo-) extractivism', 'alternative development', 'Evo Morales', 'Bolivia', 'Communitarian Socialism', 'dependency', 'Vivir Bien', 'primary resource export']"
Mafia in the Market: A Look at Ghanaian Market Women & their Methods of Survival,"Garwe, Nicole Nyasha","['Stathopoulos, Athanasios']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Africa is a generally patriarchal society, so it is interesting that when one enters the open market, it is a society where women dominate. These women are known as market women. There is significant debate over their role and their effect on the fruit and vegetable economy in Ghana. Some scholars view them as detrimental to the economy due to their strategies that include unionisation, cross-border trade among others. They also operate in an informal system that often leads to tax avoidance. On the other hand, there is the view that these women are simply making a living in a developing society and manage to aid the economy by having micro-financing schemes, putting their children through school and creating their own society where the rules are clear and there is co-dependence. The thesis aims to explore both these schools of thought and clearly define what role these women play through both socio-economic and cultural lenses with a final conclusion determining to what extent the Ghanaian economy is affected by their activities",

Public-Private Partnerships and Sustainable Development in Kenya,"Bierkens, Philip Alexander","['London, Jonathan']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Public-private Partnerships (PPPs) are today considered an integral avenue for the pursuit of Kenya’s sustainable development agenda. They are seen as a vehicle through which the government involves the private sector in its development agenda to assist in the provision of public goods and services. The international development community continues to promote PPPs as a model for sustainable development too. Nonetheless, our understanding of the contributions of PPPs for sustainable development is limited. The academic streams on the topic hold rival claims, which further impedes our understanding of the limits and contributions of PPPs for sustainable development. Therefore, it is essential to understand the theoretical implications of PPPs applied on a practical context. Through a case study comparison of two PPP projects in Kenya, this thesis finds that PPPs are not inherently effective or ineffective for sustainable development, but that bottom-up people-first objectives can significantly contribute to local sustainable development, to a national development agenda and the SDGs more broadly. This bottom-up approach, as opposed to the more generally used top-down approach, allows for a more effective and efficient PPP process due to political support and community engagement. Furthermore, the thesis finds that next to PPP design, the political economy of a country can significantly influence the overall effectiveness of PPPs. This means that that future PPPs should take into account the political economy context of the country and its sectors, as well as bottom-up approaches, to optimally contribute to sustainable development.","['sustainable development', 'public-private partnerships', 'SDGs', 'sustainability', 'global political economy', 'Kenya', 'PPPs', 'private sector involvement']"

Regime Survival in the International Community: North Korea's Institutional Legacies in Kim Jong-Un's New Year Speeches,"Jong, Roza de","['Choi, Nankyung']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since Kim Jong-un acceded as North Korea’s state leader in 2012, it was speculated that North Korea would gradually become more involved in the international community. Although the absence of international involvement ensures authoritarian regime survival, authoritarian regimes benefit from involvement international community if they obtain a position of negotiation for financial and material aid. In relation to this dichotomous effect of international involvement on authoritarian state survival, this study aimed to define North Korea’s efforts to deploy its fundamental institutional legacies of state ideology, economy and military to achieve regime survival in the international community. Accordingly, the main research question that this study addressed is: How does North Korea intend to deploy its fundamental institutional legacies in the process of achieving regime survival in the international community, with regard to the dichotomous impact of international involvement on authoritarian state survival? In order to answer this question, this study conducted a word frequency analysis of Kim Jong-un’s New Year addresses from the years 2013 and 2018. Although this study disregarded the contextual value of the selected words, the data obtained from the New Year speeches indicated that North Korea intends to pursue involvement with South Korea and the United States in the international community. This study concluded that, through the preservation of the vital essence of Juche ideology and the reinforcement of the essential components of its economic institutional legacy, North Korea intends to retain regime survival in its external environment. In addition, through increasing the emphasis on its nuclear abilities, rather than reinforcing the focus on the fundamental constitutes of its military institutional legacy, it is suggested that North Korea intends to create a position of negotiation in the international community. Overall, this study could provide the foundation for future comparative research on the contemporary relation between North Korea and the international community, with regard to North Korea’s intentions for its fundamental institutional legacies and the reflection of words related to economy, military and ideology in Kim Jong-un’s New Year speeches.","['North Korea', 'word frequency analysis', 'institutional legacies', 'international community', 'Juche ideology', 'siege mentality', 'path dependence theory']"

The American Response to China's Rise to Power: An Analysis of Think Tanks' Foreign Policy Proposals Towards the Belt And Road Initiative.,"Meijer, Sebastian","['Forough, Mohammadbagher']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to enrich the discussion about the impact of China’s rise on the role of the US as a global leader, however, it wishes to avoid the theoretical prediction or speculation often seen in this discussion. Instead of using prescriptive theories, the much- anticipated American response to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be researched from an inventive angle that possesses the ability to bridge the gap between theory and policy: think tanks. Publications by think tanks are distinctly suitable for a pragmatic analysis on the direction of US foreign policy. The policy research publications of three prominent American think tanks will be analyzed to make informed statements about the direction of long-term US foreign policy towards the BRI. These think tanks have been carefully selected to represent all sides of the spectrum that dominate simultaneously the political arena of the US and the think tank sector; conservative ideology, liberal ideology, and the neutral, independent, or moderate center. Besides researching the policy recommendations in general this thesis will also research two dimensions that could have a significant impact on the American response; theoretical lenses and ideological orientations. The policy proposals are researched with a qualitative content analysis to identify their theoretical foundation of the IR-paradigms of realism and liberalism. This thesis will broadly map the position of theory, ideology, and policy in the issue at stake: the American response to the BRI. Given exacerbating trends in the think tank sector, the different positions could ultimately pose threats to geopolitical stability.","['Geopolitics', 'Foreign Policy', 'Realism', 'Liberalism', 'Think Tanks', 'Politicization', 'International Relations', 'China-U.S. relations', 'Belt and Road Initiative']"

A tale of two countries: a comparative study of the struggle for indigenous rights and the long road to reconciliation in Australia and Canada.,"Mejri, Fedi","['Moody, Simanique']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The ongoing debate in Canadian and Australian societies about the meaning of multiculturalism and the associated discussion of belonging, citizenship and national culture cannot be divorced from the consideration of a major social element in both societies: the original inhabitants of the territories prior to their colonization by the European settlers. This group of people, which over the course of the national histories of these two countries was reduced to the status of minority on its own ancestral land , has since the early 1960s demonstrated increased agency by mounting a campaign of political, cultural, economic and social mobilization to reclaim its rights, most notably through the recognition of sovereignty, and to re-negotiate its relationship with the settler majority societies. The outcome of this mobilization is often portrayed in an interesting account that shows Canada to have gone further than Australia in the accommodation of indigenous rights and the righting of the historical injustices towards them. This thesis will be an attempt to reassess the veracity of this portrayal through a comparative study of the struggle for indigenous rights in both countries.","['Indigenous rights', 'Canada', 'Australia', 'civil rights', 'social movements', 'colonialism', 'biopower', 'Aboriginals', 'residential school system', 'Stolen Generations']"

‘Qué Calor’: Reggaeton and the Reproduction of Machismo A Research on the Representation and Perception of Chilean,"Pušić, Kim","['Alves Vieira, Eduardo']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Reggaeton has risen in popularity, spreading outside its continent of origin and entertaining both Latino and non-Latino people alike in recent years. However, the songs within this music style have been criticized for their degrading lyrics that perpetuate machista behavior, which is still prevalent in Latin American countries like Chile. This paper analyses how machismo manifests in reggaeton and the extent to which its songs’ specifically vulgar lyrics affect Chilean women’s perception of gender roles, their self-worth and the state of gender equality in their society. This investigation has been conducted via an online survey in Chile among women between the ages of 18 and 30. The findings of the research indicate that the women are more or less likely to be affected by the lyrics based on their individual state of mind and demographic factors such as age, education level, and geographical location. However, seeing as the majority of the women that answered the survey could be categorized as members of the middle- and upper-classes, the results cannot be generalized beyond these particular strata of women without further research. Nonetheless, the data indicates that reggaeton still plays a role in the reproduction of machismo in Chilean society.","['Reggaeton', 'degrading lyrics', 'machismo', 'gender equality', 'Chile']"
Conceptualizing the Early Dynastic Tomb: Creation and Utilization of Private Mortuary Space,"Lunden, Geirr Kristian Homme","['Walsem, René van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The ancestors and conceptions of the afterlife have always been one of the most prevalent topics of research within Egyptology. From the ‘scenes of daily life’ in the tombs of the Old Kingdom to the New Kingdom books of the afterlife, a variety in interpretation is not lacking. It is perhaps due to this wealth of later evidence that the Early Dynastic period (c. 3000 – 2613 BCE) remains somewhat of a ‘Dark Age’ in the history of ancient Egypt. This dissertation explores the Early Dynastic attitude towards the tomb, the ancestors, and the afterlife by a holistic examination of the parts of the Early Dynastic tombs that were accessible after the interment of the tomb owner: the tomb superstructure and enclosure space. The corpus of the thesis consists of published superstructures from the Memphite area, that being the capital of Egypt at the time and most densely populated. The spaces are examined in a heuristic manner in Chapter One, with little initial reliance of previous identification and theory. Chapter Two features an examination of the material through the lenses of modern theories and methodologies. Included here are landscape biographies, the structure of the authority of things, human-thing entanglement, ancestor identity, and the ontological turn. The final chapter sees the reintegration of the material into a wider Egyptological framework. The resulting thesis has suggested that little to no uniformity can be seen in regards to post-mortem existence other than the social importance of the individual, and a subsequent wish for acknowledgement and offerings.","['Tombs', 'Early Dynastic Period', 'Relationship with the dead', 'Ancestor identity']"

In addition, it was studied how the differences in the procedures adopted by the translators have affected characterisation and character relationships. A final aspect of this thesis’ research is the inclusion of one of the translators’ views and approach to dialect translation. Based on the results of this study, it was found that the main procedure adopted in both translations is the use of only a standard variety of language, followed by omission, and finally the direct import of dialect vocabulary. As a result of the first two procedures, there is a major loss of meaning and characterisation in the translation. However, this loss is compensated in TT1 mostly through the inclusion of dialect vocabulary and in TT2 through other visual and audible means that result from ST2 and TT2 being perceived simultaneously. Finally, it is the translator of TT1’s view that there is no way of including ST dialect in the translation without making the translation incomprehensible. However, second languages in translations can be retained, and depending on the knowledge of the TT audience, the translator is allowed to retain some lexical instances of dialect in the translation.","['translation', 'literary translation', 'subtitling', 'dialect', 'dialect translation', 'Scots dialect', 'Outlander', 'characterisation', 'Gaelic', 'Scots language']"

Explaining the Development of British Conservative Euroscepticism,"Wieren, Charlotte van","['Broad, Matthew']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis offers a qualitative descriptive analysis to explain what drivers affect the development of Euroscepticism within the Conservative Party (UK) between 1990 and 2016. Three drivers are found to have enormous impact on Conservative Euroscepticism. These are as follows: inner party divide, radical right threat and issue salience within party strategy. The Conservatives became increasingly divided over European integration throughout the time frame. Through the attempts to mend this divide by Conservative leaders, most importantly John Major and David Cameron, they increasingly adopted harsher Eurosceptic policies to please their pro/anti EU divided party. UKIP, a radical right party, experienced electoral success throughout the time frame, which is seen as a threat towards the Conservatives, and thus a driver of Conservative Euroscepticism. Lastly, UKIP’s success largely interplays with issue salience. This thesis sees issue salience as a driver of Conservative Euroscepticism, as both parties adopted shifts in political strategy in order to compete for electoral success in light of EU issue salience. All three factors interplay; meaning the one affects the other.","['Euroscepticism', 'Conservative Party', 'Party Management', 'Issue Salience', 'European Integration', 'mainstream', 'niche', 'UKIP', 'BREXIT', 'UK Politics']"
"One more story, please? The Tokto/Takeshima Conflict in South Korean Children's Literature","Bremer, Ifang","['Breuker, Remco']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Koreastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines the role of Tokto/Dokdo in the creation and maintenance of South Korean nationalism, and the way in which Tokto narratives are created and disseminated in Korean society. It aims to answer the question: how is the Tokto/Takeshima conflict portrayed and communicated through South Korean Tokto-related children’s literature? Based on a critical discourse analysis of a selection of the most popular Tokto children’s literature, this thesis identifies a set pattern that characterizes Tokto children’s literature as a genre. Furthermore, this thesis challenges the modernist notion that nationalism is a top-down affair, as the analysis of Tokto children’s literature shows that nationalist sentiment stems from an interplay between governmental and civil efforts. In the case of Tokto children’s literature, that is the effort to promote and proclaim Tokto as a vital part of South Korean national identity. Lastly, this thesis argues that Tokto children’s literature reflects the agenda of Tokto activists, who seek to strengthen a particular notion of South Korean national identity that centres on the idea of Japan as continuous external threat.","['Tokto', ""Children's literature"", 'Genre studies', 'Japan-Korea relations', 'National identity', 'Political socialization']"

"From Democratisation to Genocide: Explaining Myanmar’s Atrocities Against Rohingya Muslims, 2012-2018","Holmes, Arthur J.","['Maat, Eelco van der']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"From 2010, the historically isolated state of Myanmar began a transition to democracy, a transition which would bring the first elections in nearly two decades. The regime diluted political power between the military and new civilian institutions, allowing for significant democratisation, market liberalisation and de-censoring of communications and media in the years which followed. Simultaneously, the military implemented the most intense period of atrocities in the northwestern periphery of Rakhine State, against the Rohingya Muslim minority. To date, no research has sufficiently explained why the opening up of the state of Myanmar to the international community coincided with atrocities, the severity of which may well amount to genocide. Scholarship generally attributes Myanmar’s crimes to ‘ethnic-cleavages’, a narrative which has been debunked in scholarship on other atrocity cases; or over-zealous counter-insurgency, despite no significant Rohingya insurgent group being in existence at the time these atrocities began. Rather than atrocities being coincidental to the democratisation process, this paper argues transition in fact sparked atrocities in Myanmar’s northwestern periphery, by destabilising an internal balance of power between elite rival factions. Based upon extant research into political violence, it poses a novel explanation for the timing of Myanmar’s atrocities against Rohingya Muslims. It argues that the resignation of elites in the military junta in order to compete in the 2010 elections resulted in heightened elite rivalry between the generals which took their place. Changes to the strategic environment of Myanmar’s new military leadership led to a calculation by which atrocities in Rakhine State were perceived as useful for new Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing. Having faced insecurity upon taking office in 2011, Senior General Hlaing had insurmountable control by 2018, suggesting atrocities in the northwest periphery had proven successful from the perspective of the new leadership. A new mechanism for the regression of democratisation to mass atrocities is posed, combining research into political violence with the chronology and context of Myanmar’s transition.","['Democratization', 'Genocide Theory', 'Political Violence', 'Myanmar', 'Rohingya']"

Saudi Arabia leads a military intervention in Yemen, whilst Iran diplomatically supports the Houthis and provides them with marginal military aid. The Yemeni war has been subject to various frames, varying from civil war to proxy war. This thesis focuses on the understanding of the proxy war frame. It aims to enhance the understanding of Saudi Arabia and Iran’s involvement by an examination of the portrayal of the Yemeni war in both states’ national presses. These national presses are considered propaganda tools, and thereby provide an insight into national ideologies, and the ways in which the Yemeni war is explained to domestic and foreign audiences. The rhetoric of these national presses is compared to the framework of moral responses to distant suffering. In so doing, the following research question was answered: ‘To what extent does the reporting of the Yemeni war in Saudi Arabian and Iranian national presses correspond to the rhetorical framework of moral responses to distant suffering?’.","['Yemeni War', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Iran', 'National press', 'Morality']"

Instead of focusing on the possible jihadi/terrorist threat Salafism might pose, like most previous research on European Salafism, the stances of Salafi’s on Dutch society will be analysed, and what effect this has on society. This will be done through researching the representation of Enlightenment values in Dutch political manifesto’s before and after the rise of Salafism in the Netherlands.. The thesis concludes that Salafism is a largely diverse group which rejects Enlightenment values to various degrees. Furthermore it concludes that Salafism has strengthened these Enlightenment ideals in the Netherlands, as the political manifesto’s represent Enlightenment values in a much stronger manner after the rise of Dutch Salafism.","['Salafism', 'Islam', 'Enlightenment', 'Counter Enlightenment', 'Cultural values']"

Executive Branch Hegemony in Venezuela: The Constitutional Allowance of Indefinite Presidential Re-elections and the Case of Judge Afiuni,"Briceno, Juan Pablo","['Churampi, Adriana I.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The elimination of restrictions on presidential re-elections is commonly considered detrimental for the consolidation of democracy. The removal of such limitations tends to be correlated to the increase of executive branch hegemony and political disequilibrium, as the several incumbency advantages intrinsic of the presidential position allow presidents of institutionally weak countries to easily halt any serious threat of dispossession from office. A country that lacks both presidential re-elections restrictions and judicial independence, is left with nothing but little chances of democratic alternability. In 2009, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela eliminated the restrictions on presidential re-elections contained in the Venezuelan political Constitution of 1999 by establishing through a constitutional amendment the allowance of indefinite presidential re-elections. By examining a discursive event of President Chávez during 2009, in which he informs the country about his order to sentence judge Afiuni to thirty years in prison, the present work determines the lack of a constitutional judge able to counterbalance and limit the power of the executive. Through the use of Van Dijk’s Critical Discourse Analysis on such speech, and the historical overview of the 2009 constitutional amendment, the paper clearly demonstrates how the chances for presidential alternability and democratic consolidation in Venezuela were significantly reduced.","['Bolivarian Republic', 'Venezuelan political constitution 1999', 'Indefinite presidential reelections', 'Political (dis)equilibrium', 'Judicial independence', 'Executive branch hegemony', 'Democratic alternability']"

Due to Vlasotince’s considerable growth since the end of WWII (Vukmirović 2013: 106) and the proliferation of media and schooling in the standard language, what is most commonly heard on the street nowadays is a variety with stronger influence from the standard language than is usually found in the works on Torlak dialectology from the past century, yet one that clearly retains much of its distinctive character.

Unconditional Basic Income and Reciprocity,"Dijke, Tim van","['Bagatur, Sine']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"The principle of reciprocity has been the essence of many different reciprocity arguments against the unconditional basic income (UBI). In brief, this entails that one who enjoys the benefits of social cooperation, should also contribute to the social cooperation. In this essay I introduce three perspectives on the reciprocity objection against basic income that reflect current societal tendencies. I also counter the objections against the basic income these perspectives pose. First the libertarian perspective combines the principle of reciprocity with a strong focus on self-ownership, private property and the minimal state. Second, the societal perspective entails that UBI undermines the political, economic and social structures of society through the lack of a reciprocity element in its program. Third, the market perspective shows that UBI poses a threat to the market mechanism, which pursues the common good, because there is no need for reciprocating the basic income. If these objections are true, this poses a serious problem for UBI. Yet, I demonstrate that the underlying arguments of these objections are flawed and inconsistent, so that it is fair to conclude that these reciprocity objections do not hold in relation to UBI.",['Unconditional Basic Income Reciprocity']

Rose Revolution: Mass Mobilization for Political Change Consensus and Action Mobilization through Framing Strategies,"Kuvendjieska, Zlatka","['Boele, Otto']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2003, in response to the terminal socioeconomic instability and political ignorance, the Georgian civil society initiated a wave of mobilization, consolidation and protest actions. The Rose Revolution represents the culmination of elite tensions and civil disobedience. The Revolution continues to be one of the most influential and important Color Revolutions in the post-Soviet sphere because of the large-scale mobilization of Georgian citizens. Consequently, the purpose of this thesis is to identify how did the Rose Revolution develop and promote mass mobilization required for political change. The thesis adopts the concept of “framing” and the three different framing strategies (diagnostic, prognostic, motivational) and applies them to the case of the Rose Revolution in order to analyze the consensus and action mobilization of the protest actors. By pursuing these strategies, the Rose Revolution opened opportunities for confidence and hope among the Georgian citizens. People began to distinguish between politics and the party, and thus the parties began to lose the occupied space of the political. Especially the prognostic strategies liberated the activist cores, enabled them to ‘flourish’. In other words, the public got inspired to take part in the popular discontent with the governmental establishment.","['Georgia', 'Rose Revolution', 'Civil society', 'Mobilization']"

Ovid's Daedalus Analogy,"Riepma, Reuben","['Wessels, A.B.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis charts Ovidian references to Daedalus, the archetypal craftsman, made in and around the poet's 'own' exile. Analysis reveals several strong parallels between the artists (the poetic persona and his mythical character): firstly, and most simply, they are innovative; they also reside in hated exile; they suffer oppression by authority; they advise 'moderation' to their ‘children’; they grieve and repudiate their arts; yet literary immortality brings some sort of consolation. Considering these rich parallels, this thesis states the case for a strong analogy between the two that effectively adds layers of significance to Ovid's own status as an artist - one who can both fly and fall. This leads further to a reflection on 'why', and on what effects this might produce. This thesis suggests poetic self-aggrandisement, the evocation of sympathy, and also a deeper poetological point about how one subjectively adopts/responds to such techniques in reading and being read as an artist/audience.","['Ovid', 'Daedalus', 'Metamorphoses', 'alter-ego', 'Epistulae Ex Ponto', 'Tristia', 'artist', 'exile']"
A Victory for the Principle of Military Burden-Sharing? Explaining the Role of the United States in the 2011 Intervention in Libya,"Rooij, Mats de","['Thakur, Vineet']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis will seek to explore the Obama administration’s reasoning behind its foreign policy of ‘leading from behind’ in the NATO alliance. While the United States proved willing to account for an excessive share of the burden during, for example, the intervention in the former Yugoslavia of 1999, Washington DC called for a wider shared responsibility during the 2011 intervention in Libya. It will be argued that the core arguments of the hegemonic stability theory, which are generally neglected in debates about military burden-sharing, render useful in explaining this shift in American contributions made to the NATO alliance. By analysing and comparing the two major NATO air campaigns in the former Yugoslavia and Libya, it will be revealed that the shift from a unipolar to a multi-polar world has resulted in this new direction in US foreign policy. This thesis will demonstrate that the unipolar world in which the intervention in the former Yugoslavia took place allowed the US to retain – and even strengthen – its hegemonic position in the global order. However, the Obama administration took the relative decline of US power into account in its decision to lead from behind in Libya. As predicted by the hegemonic stability theory, hegemons that lose power become less willing to accept free-riding in alliances and reconsider the way in which they spend their resources. The intervention in Libya should, therefore, be considered as a tipping point that reflected this new direction in US foreign policy.","['NATO', 'Military Burden-Sharing', 'Libya', 'Leading from Behind', 'Hegemonic Stability Theory']"

Smokin’ hot: Nationalism in Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company newspaper advertisements,"Tjiong, Louis Xia Wei","['Teh, Limin']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This bachelor thesis examines the use of nationalist elements in Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company (NBTC) advertisements in the Shenbao newspaper between 1919 and 1937. Changes in the political climate and the resurgent competition with other tobacco companies played a role in the decision of the NBTC to engage in the nationalist sentiment that prevailed in society. Taking into account the relative novelties of nationalism, factory manufactured tobacco, multinational companies, competitive rivalry, print media and advertisements in print media, this examination sheds light on how a 'domestic' tobacco company uses nationalism in its advertisements and what kinds of language, signs and symbols are used to get across the 'domestic' image of the company. Due to the complicated historical origin of the NBTC, one might question whether the NBTC can be regarded as a domestic company that produces 'National products'. Before the advertisements are examined, background information about various subjects is provided to get familiarized with important economic developments, the political stage and nationalism.","['Republican China', 'Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company', 'Nationalism', 'Shenbao', 'Newspaper advertisements analysis', 'National products']"

Italiaanse factcheckers in de strijd tegen desinformatie en ‘bufale’: Een onderzoek naar de rolopvattingen en werkwijzen van Italiaanse factcheckers,"Opromolla, Fiorella Luisa","['Pleijter, Alexander']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Nepnieuws is een veelbesproken fenomeen dat overal ter wereld aandacht krijgt: van Europa tot Zuid-Amerika en van Azië tot Afrika. De afgelopen jaren zijn er in korte tijd veel factcheck-organisaties opgezet in Europa en ook de Italianen blijven daarbij zeker niet achter. Een aantal bekende en grote organisaties als Pagella Politica en Lavoce.info zijn niet de enige die zich bezighouden met factchecken: ook zijn er mensen die vanuit een hobby of passie actief bezig zijn met factchecken. In dit onderzoek is gekeken naar de rolopvattingen en werkwijzen van Italiaanse factcheckers. Uit diepte-interviews met acht factcheckers is gebleken dat de rolopvatting grotendeels afhankelijk is van een lidmaatschap bij de Ordine dei Giornalisti, de journalistengilde. Het is in Italië niet mogelijk om jezelf officieel een journalist te noemen in Italië als je daar geen lid van bent. Italiaanse factcheckers hebben dus verschillende rolopvattingen, en de mensen die lid zijn van de ODG noemen zichzelf een journalist. De rest noemt zichzelf een factchecker of debunker. De werkwijzen van de Italiaanse factcheckers komen op bepaalde vlakken overeen: checkbare claims worden vooral gevonden via sociale media, kranten en televisie en het benaderen van bronnen en experts is van groot belang bij het maken van een factcheck. De beoordelingssystemen die factcheckers gebruiken verschillen per organisatie, en ook de ideeën over de effectiviteit en bruikbaarheid daarvan verschillen per persoon.","['Factchecken', 'Nepnieuws', 'Rolopvatting', 'Werkwijze', 'Italië', 'Journalist', 'Desinformatie', 'Debunker', 'Objectiviteit']"

How Trump Trumps Rhetoric: A Stylistic Comparison Between Pre- and Post-Election Trump-Speeches,"Coté, Jelle","['Jeffery, Jill']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This article examines whether the speeches given by Donald Trump after his election have become more presidential since his election campaign speeches in 2016. Four speeches, selected from both before and after the 2016 elections, have been analysed and compared in two different ways. The speeches selected from before the elections were Trump’s announcement of his run for the presidency and his acceptance of the Republican nomination. The selection of post-election speeches consisted of the first speech Trump gave to a joint session of congress in his official appearance as president and his first official SOTU address. The first manner of comparison used Pennebaker et al’s (2007) Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) programme. The second manner of comparison analysed the speeches for their differences in their use of rhetorical and stylistic figures. The analysis showed that the speeches given by Trump before his 2016 election were less complex, more divisive and less positive than those given after his election. Furthermore, the analysis showed that the use of stylistic devices in the pre-election speeches was more focused on emphasising problems, whereas post-election they were used more to emphasise achievement and to embellish the speech itself. This suggests that there has been a visible change in style between the two periods, which indicates that Trump’s speeches have become more like those of his predecessors.","['Trump', 'rhetorical figures', 'speech analysis', 'LIWC']"

FOR MEN AND BY WOMEN: HOW WOMEN ARE PORTRAYED IN SOUTH KOREAN ALCOHOL COMMERCIALS,"Dielen, Isabelle","['Veldkamp, Elmer']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Koreastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Alcohol commercials are a universal phenomenon. In Asian countries such as South Korea however, given the cultural and societal emphasis on traditional gender roles, the way alcohol is sold and consumed differs from other countries. Commercials often show the consumer how the producers believe people will use their product in a natural environment or otherwise how they want the consumer to view this certain product. This paper, therefore, analyzes different alcohol commercials in order to answer the following research question. How are South Korean women portrayed in Korean alcohol commercials and how does this differ from cultural and societal reality? The gender differences that can be noticed in all of these researches contain an important message within them, which is that gender inequality in South Korea is still an ongoing issue. Through commercials in which these female actors are portrayed as if they are truly part of the Korean culture, there is a dissonance between the truth and what people want to believe. People want to believe that, as a woman in South Korea society, they can take part in any activity they want. Truthfully, however, they are portrayed through these commercials as a marketing object that sells and as someone who is in any case still the inferior half of society.","['South Korea', 'Soju', 'Alcohol', 'Commercials', 'Gender']"

The multi-level interplay in asylum politics. The case of the Christian asylum seekers from Turkey in West Germany in the early 1980s,"Schulz, Maren","['Schrover, M.L.J.C. (Marlou)']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the early 1980s, the number of asylum seekers doubled in West Germany and the issue got increasingly politicised. Most of the asylum seekers originated from Turkey where political unrest and socio-ethnic conflicts were widespread. In this setting, Turkish asylum seekers belonging to Christian minorities became a source of controversy within the German Federal Ministry of the Interior. This thesis looks into the dynamics of asylum politics through analysing primary sources from the Federal Ministry of the Interior that depict the most important intergovernmental, federal and societal governance actors who either argued in favour of or against the admission of this specific group of asylum seekers. Their interplay is examined with the help of four main concepts under the umbrella of the gap hypothesis, which explain why the Christian asylum seekers were granted a right to stay in the long run although their asylum applications were first rejected: The liberal paradox of democratic states and the difficulty of interpreting the right of asylum gave room for multiple actors negotiating the case. Eventually, the positively constructed social class of the asylum seekers enabled the political realm to reach consensus to smartly settle the liberal paradox with a generously applied hardship regulation.","['Asylum politics', 'Migration', 'Governance', 'Germany', 'Turkey', 'Federal Ministry of the Interior', 'Gap Hypothesis']"
The influence of English as L2 on the processing of preposition stranding by Dutch L1 speakers.,"Vos, Renate","['Pablos Robles, Leticia']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study aimed to investigate how Dutch natives with a different exposure to English as a second language process Dutch sentences with a preposition stranding structure. It reacts on an earlier study by Koopman (2010), who reported that P-stranding is only grammatical with r-pronouns and not with non-r DPs. Preposition stranding with non-r DPs is grammatical in English, and English is becoming more and more present as a second language in the Netherlands. Therefore, the present study tested whether preposition stranding in Dutch could be undergoing a shift towards the English structure, and whether we could see this reflected in the processing strategies of on the one hand, a group of students with a high exposure to English and on the other hand, a group of student with a low exposure to English. Two groups of students were tested in a word-by-word self-paced reading task, and the results showed a clear difference between the two groups. Even if at first the obtained results seemed contradictory with the hypothesized results, as the high proficient group showed a bigger slowdown after the stranded P than the low proficient group, after critical reflection on the stimuli and the data, evidence was found that the high proficient group uses an English processing mode while reading Dutch sentences with a seemingly English structure.","['Preposition stranding', 'L2', 'Self-paced reading', 'Language shift']"

Livius besluit boek 22 met de besluitvorming in de senaat over het losgeld voor de Romeinse krijgsgevangenen die in handen van Hannibal zijn gevallen. Het besluit wordt genomen tegen de achtergrond van een militaire en civiele noodsituatie. Livius illustreert diverse aspecten die traditioneel met virtus werden geassocieerd in scènes voorafgaand, tijdens en na een slag. Zonder deze aspecten of virtus te benoemen, herkent de lezer deze aspecten in zijn weergave van het senaatsbesluit. Op subtiele wijze neemt de lezer kennis van een senaatsbesluit dat getuigt van een vorm van virtus in een historische setting waarin traditionele en meer contemporaine aspecten van virtus zijn verwerkt. Kenmerkend voor de wijze waarop de senaat tot zijn besluit komt is de beslissing om de tijd te nemen voor het horen van verschillende standpunten, de relatie met de omstandigheden en tegelijkertijd de eerbied voor de kern van de traditionele virtus-cultuur.","['Livius', 'consilium', 'boek 22', 'virtus']"
Assessing the Impact of the European Union’s Novel Data Protection Legislation on European Transatlantic Competitiveness in the Development of Artificial Intelligence,"Akkerman, Nick","['Oster, Jan']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study examines the impact of recently introduced personal data protection legislation of the European Union (EU) on the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in Europe. It compares the competitive position of the EU in relation to the United States (US), which is in many respects the market leader in the field of AI. It finds that the degree of freedom for the collection and handling of personal data by companies working with AI is central for the functioning of machine-learning and deep learning. The wide definition of personal data, as has been constituted by the EU in the Breyer case, has resulted in a wide variance of data being labelled personal data through the EU regulatory scope. Therefore, the legal framework in the EU that deals with nearly all data is the recently implemented General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), since this is the appropriate framework for personal data. This study finds that the GDPR severely limits the freedom to collect and process personal data on the long-term by companies, most notably through the ""right to be forgotten"" and the ""right to explanation"". These rights, deriving from the GDPR, have several negative effects on the ability of European companies to use personal data to develop their AI systems, which negatively affect their competitive position vis-à-vis the US, which still has more relaxed data protection regulation. However, we are starting to see that the European data protection model is being implemented in other jurisdictions. The US has announced the California Consumer Protection Act, which echoes some key provisions from the GDPR, but is still being reviewed by the state of California. Moreover, due to several factors that are discussed in the study and the so-called “Brussel’s effect”, this study finds that it is highly likely that the trend of privacy norms stemming from the GDPR being copied by the US will continue and therefore will ‘level the playing field’ for European and American firms developing AI.","['artificial intelligence', 'machine-learning', 'deep learning', 'GDPR', 'personal data protection', 'European Union', 'pseudonymization', 'personal data', 'privacy', 'transatlantic']"
De waarheid in beeld - Een kwalitatief onderzoek naar de ervaring van Nederlandse hbo-journalistiekstudenten met online verifiëring om de authenticiteit van foto- en videomateriaal vast te stellen,"Zuijdam, Kelly van","['Burger, Peter']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Journalisten zullen in hun werkzaamheden steeds vaker te maken krijgen met verifiëring van foto- en videomateriaal afkomstig van sociale media, mede omdat sociale media journalisten van informatie voorzien waar zij anders wellicht geen toegang toe zouden krijgen. Het is dan ook relevant om de ervaring van journalistiekstudenten met online verifiëring vast te stellen; zij zijn immers de journalisten van morgen. Daarnaast is het voor opleidingen belangrijk om aandacht te besteden aan verifiëring, zodat studenten klaargestoomd worden voor het journalistieke werkveld. Om die reden gaat deze scriptie in op de ervaring van Nederlandse hbo-journalistiekstudenten met online verifiëring om de authenticiteit van foto- en videomateriaal vast te stellen. Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd aan de hand van semigestructureerde interviews, waarin ook een praktische opdracht aan bod is gekomen. Bij die praktische opdracht werd aan de studenten gevraagd om hardop na te denken, zodat hun genomen stappen onderzocht en geanalyseerd konden worden. Uit de resultaten is uiteindelijk naar voren gekomen dat Nederlandse hbo-journalistiekstudenten weinig ervaring hebben met online verifiëring om de authenticiteit van foto- en videomateriaal vast te stellen. Hoewel de aanname was dat jongeren wellicht meer affiniteit hebben met verificatie omdat zij zijn opgegroeid in een internettijdperk, geven de journalistiekstudenten aan dat zij helemaal niet altijd zo behendig zijn volgens henzelf. Ze geven aan dat ze het nog lastig vinden om te bepalen welke content zij kunnen vertrouwen. Hun verificatievaardigheden zijn matig, waardoor studenten moeite hebben om beeldmateriaal afkomstig van sociale media te verifiëren. Opvallend genoeg zochten een aantal studenten tijdens de praktische opdracht ter plekke in Google op hoe zij online beelden konden verifiëren. Sommige andere studenten gaven aan dat zij een traditionele journalistieke aanpak zouden hanteren: bellen. Er ligt hier dan ook een winstpunt voor hbo-journalistiekopleidingen. Binnen hogescholen komen volgens de studenten vooral traditionele journalistieke handelingen aan bod, maar er is weinig ruimte voor diepgang over onderwerpen als sociale media en verifiëring. Daar wordt er volgens de studenten vooral aandacht besteed aan het opstellen van onderzoeksrapporten, creative commons, hoor- en wederhoor, en andere standaard journalistieke praktijken. Volgens de studenten zou het dan ook goed zijn als kennis van sociale media en verifiëring gestimuleerd wordt.","['Verificatie', 'Sociale media', 'Authenticiteit', 'Journalistiekstudenten', 'Beeldmateriaal', 'Factchecken']"

Familiar Traits in a New Reality: The Central Bank of Russia's Response to Economic Sanctions,"Kowalski, Boris","['Skalamera, Morena']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The economic sanctions introduced by the United States and European Union against Russia since 2014 have specifically targeted Russia’s financial system, while having significant negative consequences for Russia’s macroeconomic position. Yet, today the Russian financial system continues to function in a stable manner while inflation is low for modern Russian standards. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is the main actor responsible for guaranteeing the stability of the Russian financial system and has used a range of monetary and institutional policies to do so. Therefore, this research aims to explain the monetary and institutional policies pursued by the CBR in response to economic sanctions in the context of Russia’s political economy. The research uses process tracing in order to analyse the policy decisions by the CBR used since 2014 and explain them in the context of developments in Russia’s political economy in recent decades. The research finds that the CBR’s monetary policy is different compared to earlier crises, but not novel as many policy decisions can be traced back to developments in the CBR’s policies over the last decade. Meanwhile, the CBR’s institutional policies can be linked to developments in Russia’s political economy, as they are increasingly aimed at sterilising the Russian economy from external shocks. Therefore, even though the CBR’s crisis response can be seen as successful from the perspective of Russian policymakers, the content of the policies is not surprising considering broader developments in Russia’s political economy.","['Central Bank of Russia', 'Economic Sanctions', 'Monetary Policy', 'Institutional Policy', 'Political Economy']"

Kritiek via Twitter: een goede voorzet of roepen langs de zijlijn? - De kritiek die sportjournalisten krijgen via Twitter en hoe ze hiermee omgaan,"Euwe, Quirien","['Pleijter, Alexander']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Het in 2006 opgerichte Twitter is inmiddels een belangrijk onderdeel geworden van de werkroutine van menig journalist. Dit geldt zeker ook voor sportjournalisten, die er een groot publiek treffen. Een van de gevolgen van Twitter, is dat voor journalisten een extra kanaal is ontstaan voor het krijgen van kritiek. Door de jaren heen is het nodige onderzoek gedaan naar Twitter, sportjournalistiek, kritiek en combinaties van de deze onderwerpen. Specifiek onderzoek naar de combinatie ‘Twitter’, ‘kritiek’ en ‘sportjournalistiek’ ontbreekt echter nog. Dit onderzoek gaat wel uit van die combinatie en heeft als doel een beeld te schetsen van de soorten kritiek die sportjournalisten krijgen via Twitter en de manieren waarop ze hiermee omgaan. Dit onderzoek werd uitgevoerd onder tien sportjournalisten. Op de kritiek die de journalisten gedurende zes maanden ontvingen via Twitter, werd, evenals op hun reacties op kritiek in deze periode, een kwalitatieve inductieve inhoudsanalyse toegepast. Ook werden bij deze journalisten kwalitatieve interviews afgenomen. Vanwege het kwalitatieve karakter van beide onderzoeksmethoden zijn op basis van dit onderzoek geen uitspraken te doen over de mate waarin bevindingen ook van toepassing zijn op sportjournalisten die niet aan dit onderzoek deelnamen. Uit de inhoudsanalyse kwam naar voren dat er een onderscheid is tussen beledigingen en bedreigingen aan de ene kant en inhoudelijke kritiek aan de andere kant. Inhoudelijke kritiek kan onderverdeeld worden in ‘kritiek op een mening’, ‘kritiek op de kwaliteit van de (uiting van een) journalist’, ‘het betwisten van de objectiviteit van de journalist’ en ‘het suggereren van een feitelijke onjuistheid’. Verder kwam naar voren dat de reacties van journalisten kunnen worden opgedeeld in ‘constructief’ aan de ene kant, tegenover ‘niet-constructief’ aan de andere kant. Ook zorgde de inhoudsanalyse voor een beeld van het twittergebruik van de journalisten, dat tijdens de interviews aan de journalisten kon worden voorgelegd en waaraan de uitkomsten van de interviews konden worden getoetst. Uit de interviews kwam naar voren dat kritiek zeker nuttig kan zijn, maar dat de journalisten het merendeel van de kritiek niet als nuttig beschouwen. Een uitzondering daarop is het gewezen worden op een feitelijke onjuistheid. Daar zeggen de journalisten bijna altijd wat aan te hebben. De journalisten raken over het algemeen niet in de war van de kritiek en zeggen dat ze vinden dat kritiek erbij hoort. Ook zeggen ze dat kritiek weinig invloed heeft op hun werk. Wel zeggen enkele journalisten te signaleren dat collega’s uit angst voor kritiek via sociale media, niet alles durven te doen of schrijven. Geen van de journalisten dit bij zichzelf zo te ervaren.","['Twitter', 'Sportjournalistiek', 'Sociale media', 'Kritiek', 'Sportjournalisten']"
Heritage Language Maintenance and Shift among Chinese Families in The Hague,"Li, Xuefei","['Lukac, Morana']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study investigates attitudes toward heritage language maintenance and shift among Chinese parents and their children in The Hague. It specifically explores the attitudes held by the parents and efforts made by them to maintain their children’s proficiency in Chinese language varieties. Ten families residing in The Hague were included in the study. Data for this paper were drawn from an online questionnaire shared through Wechat and face-to-face interviews with two families. Analysis of the data indicates that Chinese parents value their heritage language very much and they make a lot of efforts to maintain their children’s proficiency in Chinese language varieties. The children, however, do not have the same attitudes compared to their parents. Most of them consider Chinese to be a challenging language and do not see the necessity of learning it. Meanwhile, a lingua franca shift from Cantonese to Mandarin is gradually taking place and a new Chinese migrant category has been emerging in The Hague over time. Moreover, the local Dutch schools also play an important role in heritage language maintenance (HLM). My findings suggest that parents should attempt to adopt more measures to encourage their children to learn Chinese, and cultivate interest in Chinese culture and language for their children in order to motivate them to learn Chinese at a young age. Furthermore, the local Dutch schools should also continue the current education system and try to cooperate with parents in emphasizing the significance of Chinese heritage language.","['language maintenance', 'language shift', 'lingua franca', 'language attitudes']"

The study hypothesises that the statements made were meant to redefine gender identities, societal values, and gender role expectations for women in the Japanese society and to find empowerment within the societal structures. It hypothesises that the statements were meant to signify a rebellion against the idea that dressing in a stereotypically feminine, childlike, and kawaii way is disempowering for women. Furthermore, this research finds that Japanese Gothic Lolitas lay the foundation to rethink the gendered structures embedded in the Japanese society through the signifiers of their clothing and the discourse within their statements by defining themselves not in relation to others, but to themselves. Thus, a framework is created that allows women to rebel against the traditional constraints of gender role expectations and to redefine their identities as influential, assertive individuals.","['Criticlal Discourse Analysis', 'Gender Identity', 'Gender Performativity', 'Clothing Semiotics', 'Feminism', 'Japan', 'Gothic Lolita']"

Dit wordt gedaan aan de hand van de volgende onderzoeksvraag: hoe verhoudt zich de betogende religieuze sproke formeel, retorisch en exhortatief tot de preek en wat zegt dit over de functie van de betogende religieuze sproke? Het corpus voor dit onderzoek bestaat uit de 51 sproken die door Hogenelst in Sproken en sprekers als betogend religieus worden aangemerkt. Eerst worden de begrippen ‘preek’ en ‘sproke’ gedefinieerd en de formele, retorische en exhortatieve kenmerken waarop de betogende religieuze sproken worden geanalyseerd toegelicht. De sproken worden daarna geanalyseerd op formele aspecten van een preek, koppelingen met feestdagen en liturgie, op retorische kenmerken waaronder het gezag van de spreker, het citeren en parafraseren van autoriteiten en de uitwerking van de dilatatio en tot slot op hun exhortatieve karakter. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat er genoeg overeenkomsten op formeel, retorisch en functioneel gebied te vinden zijn tussen de preek en de betogende religieuze sproke om een verband tussen deze twee genres te leggen. Er zijn zelfs diverse aanwijzingen dat de betogende religieuze sproke gefunctioneerd heeft als een soort preek voor de leek.

Prosthetic memory in The Birth of a Nation: The effect of the sociopolitical context on prosthetic memories,"Rozendaal, Tim Jan","['Polak, Sara']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis aims to investigate the prosthetic memories generated by the movie ''The Birth of a Nation'' made in 1915 by D.W. Griffith. The theory of prosthetic memory, conceived by Allison Landsberg, claims that the advent of mass culture has given rise to a new type of collective memory that can reach a broader audience than has been possible thus far. As such, it can potentially be politically progressive by enhancing mutual understanding between different groups. A close reading will be executed and subsequently considered in two sociopolitical contexts: that of 1915 when the film was issued, and the present. This is done because the sociopolitical values between these two eras with regard to race-based discrimination are significantly different, which in turn impacts the nature of the prosthetic memories generated. The thesis statement is, in that light, that the sociopolitical context in which a prosthetic memory is generated determines whether the memory is politically progressive or regressive. Landsberg has argued that prosthetic memories can be politically progressive but neither she has pointed at the importance of the sociopolitical context to this, nor has any other scholar. As such, the argument made in this thesis could potentially supplement Landsberg's theory.",

Betrouwbaarheid beoordelen: De invloed van journalistieke objectieve stijl op geloofwaardigheid,"Thelosen, Sandrine","['Pleijter, Alexander']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Steeds meer mensen geven aan dat ze niet weten wat ze wel en niet moeten geloven in de (online) media. Jongeren gebruiken steeds minder nieuwsmedia en als ze nieuws consumeren doen ze dat dikwijls online. Dat hoeft geen enkel probleem te zijn voor de vergaring van hun informatie, mits zij de online nieuwsberichten goed kunnen beoordelen. De mediawijsheid van jongeren, maar ook van volwassenen, moet daarvoor dus ontwikkeld zijn. Dit gaat om het begrijpen, analyseren en op waarden schatten van nieuws. Geloofwaardigheid of credibility is een subjectief oordeel over hoe betrouwbaar een artikel is. In dit onderzoek ligt de focus op message credibility. Objectiviteit is een van de aspecten om de geloofwaardigheid van een artikel te vergroten. Journalisten gebruiken strategieën om objectief over te komen. Drie van dit soort elementen worden gebruikt in dit onderzoek: de kop, de stijl van de tekst en de bronvermelding. Het is de vraag of middelbare scholieren en hun docenten in staat zijn om deze elementen te herkennen. Aan de hand van een veldexperiment en interviews wordt de gedachtegang van de respondenten geanalyseerd. Zij krijgen artikelen te lezen, waarvan de helft gemanipuleerd is en geven vervolgens aan waarom ze een tekst wel of niet geloofwaardig vinden. Hieruit is gebleken dat zowel scholieren als docenten zich niet erg bewust zijn van de elementen van objectiviteit. De docenten waren meer kritisch dan de scholieren. Correct brongebruik wordt het vaakst als argument voor geloofwaardigheid gezien. Voor dit onderzoek waren alle artikelen van één medium afkomstig in de hoop dat dat geen rol zou spelen. Het bleek echter dat de meeste respondenten in het medium het meest geloofwaardige element zagen.","['Journalism', 'Credibility', 'Media literacy', 'objectivity', 'Geloofwaardigheid', 'betrouwbaarheid', 'Mediawijsheid', 'objectiviteit']"
A typological study of evidentiality in Linguistic Melanesia,"Mayer, Clemens","['Engelenhoven, Aone van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis studies evidentiality in Linguistic Melanesia. The thesis focuses on the differences and similarities of evidential strategies in a sample of languages spoken throughout the area while trying to refrain from using a rigid framework in which to place the strategies. This leads to a broad, adjusted definition of evidentiality that allows evidentiality to be seen as a more general strategy for expressing a speaker’s access to certain information, rather than only the grammatical encoding of this. The thesis studies languages from both the Austronesian and Papuan language families and compares each language’s strategy both individually and in context of linguistic and geographical proximity. As this is a typological overview, it is the goal to give an impression of the situation that is as objective as possible. Therefore, generalizations were minimalized and conclusions given or tendencies highlighted only based on the data within this study. Hopefully, this thesis shows that rigid (typological) demarcations of features is not always helpful but can often hamper a deeper understanding and skew typological overviews.","['Linguistics', 'Papuan Languages', 'Austronesian Languages', 'Linguistic Typology', 'Evidentiality']"
"South Sudanese Health Beliefs and Health-Seeking Behaviour in regard to Tuberculosis, in Adjumani District, Uganda: a medical sociology approach","Morber, Julia Roswitha","['Dekker, Marleen', 'Akinyoade, Akinyinka']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"AIM: It is the aim of this study to understand how and why South Sudanese women living in refugee settlements in Adjumani look for treatment in regard to Tuberculosis (TB), by answering the main question ‘What are the health beliefs and health-seeking behaviour within the South Sudanese community in Adjumani district in regard to Tuberculosis?’. The sub-questions focus on different factors that influence health-seeking behaviour and health beliefs. METHODS: Focus group discussions (FGDs) (15) and individual interviews (3) with South Sudanese women were held in different refugee settlements in the Adjumani district in Northern Uganda. These were transcribed and analysed through ‘open’, ‘axial’ and ‘selective’ coding. Also, respondents were asked to draw something TB related, to make a visual interpretation of their knowledge about TB. By using Seale’s (2008) scheme, factors that influence health beliefs and health-seeking behaviour were formulated to answer the main question. Additionally, the district TB focal person was interviewed. RESULTS: The main health beliefs were that TB is a contagious disease which is mainly transmitted through sharing a cup with an infected person and that it is curable. Still, in more than half of the FGDs respondents said TB is caused by other factors (such as heavy work or fear) and in about one third of the FGDs no respondents mentioned the early symptoms of TB. In more than half of FGDs respondents said they would isolate someone with TB. The health-seeking behaviour of the respondents was commendable, since all respondents sought to find treatment when necessary. However, the majority would end up looking for treatment at a private clinic or a distant health facility, since the closest health facility would not provide them with medicine or the treatment they were expecting. In one in five of the FGDs a respondent mentioned self-treatment in the form of finishing old medication or using local herbs. The main factors that influence health beliefs about TB in this study are body perception, perception of susceptibility, supernatural beliefs, levels of education and familiarity with TB. The main factors that influence health-seeking behaviour are experiences with health care in Uganda, distance to the health facility, familiarity with TB, compliance and identity. CONCLUSION: To conclude, even though the health beliefs and perceptions about TB among the South Sudanese women were often different from medical or professional points of view, the health seeking behaviour was very much present and the South Sudanese women were willing to find treatment whenever they considered it necessary. Nevertheless, due to bad experiences with the health facilities, which was mainly about frequent drug-stock-outs, bad attitude of health workers, lay-professional rivalry and inappropriate testing machines, the South Sudanese mothers believe that the district’s health facilities are often unable to make a proper diagnosis. With the insecurity of how the conflict in South Sudan will continue, it will be important for the district to more strongly monitor the spread of TB and include the perspective of the South Sudanese community in order to understand why and where people look for treatment. Recommendations for the district health office and for future research were formulated.","['South Sudanese refugees', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'Health Beliefs', 'Health-Seeking Behaviour']"
The Glocalization of Hip Hop in Russia: The Difference Between Mass Taste and Mass Culture,"Lilla, Andrea","['Skalamera, Morena']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Both the Russian and Soviet youths demonstrated an attraction for Western music. With the collapse of the USSR, American popular music has had the opportunity to increment its leverage on the cultural and political developments of the country. Nowadays, rap is a genre that is playing a major role in Russia society. Even Putin is aware of the magnitude and the influence that rap has on local youth. Indeed, a major control over the development of this genre has been recently brought up to debate by the president. Taking into account the strong censorship which characterized the freedom of music expression during Soviet Union and the importance of the relation between culture and politics in this region; an analysis of the lyrics of contemporary Russian artists can be regarded as an opportunity to better comprehend Russia’s culture and its political stances within today’s globalized reality. Therefore, the concept of glocalization will be adopted in order to pinpoint the adaptation of Hip hop subculture in Russia and its political and cultural impacts on the society of the country.","['Glocalization', 'Hip hop', 'Globalization', 'Youth Subcultures', 'Russian Hip Hop', 'Soviet Culture']"

Lobbying within the European Committee of the Regions by Dutch members: multilevel governance in practice,"Verhees, Sóphia","['Rood, Jan']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"As a result of large decentralization processes of recent times, Dutch decentral governments have had to increasingly deal with the implementation of laws and regulations coming from the European Union (IPO1 and HNP2, 2015: 9). The decentralization process has allegedly made it therefore increasingly important for Dutch provinces and municipalities to influence European policies, as the latter are ultimately responsible for the implementation of said policies (Mastenbroek et al., 2013: 20). Next to this process of decentralization, another process has simultaneously taken place; namely, the fortification of the position of European provinces and municipalities within the EU decision-making procedure on laws and regulations. The strengthened position of regions and municipalities has been warranted by, among other institutions, the Committee of the Regions (ibid.). Situated in Brussels, the Committee exists of 350 members (and 350 alternates); these members are regionally or locally elected officials within their own member state (“About”, cor.europa.eu). Members write opinions on new EU laws which are proposed by the European Commission. Furthermore, the Committee of the Regions has, through its active promotion of multilevel governance (the institution has issued both a White Paper and a Charter on the application of this theory), established itself as an advocate for the inclusion of subnational governments in European-level policy crafting and implementation. Multilevel governance has been described by the Committee as cooperation between various levels of government (local, regional, national and supranational) (“A Charter to do what?”, portal.cor.europa.eu). The central research question of this thesis pertains to the ways in which Dutch Committee members make use of the Committee, as it has emerged that the Committee has multiple functions. The first chapter of this thesis will feature a theoretical and practical discussion of multilevel governance theory. In the second chapter, the history, functions, and level of influence of the Committee of the Regions will be touched upon. The third and final chapter contains the results of interviews conducted with representatives of both provincial- and municipal Dutch Committee members and an external academic in the field. The central question of chapter three, divided into subquestions, is posed with the purpose of determining in what ways the Dutch representatives have utilized the Committee of the Regions. The conclusion features an analysis as to which features of the Committee might be regarded of as characteristics of a multilevel governance institution.","['multilevel governance', 'Committee of the Regions', 'lobbying', 'subnational governments']"

Towards a Corporate Social Responsibility Culture in Iran Drawing a basis to establishing the concept of CSR culture from the stakeholder theory and Business case for CSR,"Schön, Vincent Louis","['Immerzeel, Mattheus']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The increasing presence and influence of companies in the political, economic, and social aspects of life has led to the questioning of the roles and responsibilities that should be taken by them in society. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a concept arose from the debate around the before mentioned issue. CSR is considered to be contextual. Due to this assumption, research has gone into the realities of CSR in developing economies. Furthermore, political, cultural, and religious values on CSR themes within specific regions have been included as potential factors of analysis. As such Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) provides an interesting and vastly underresearched case study on CSR culture. The thesis will examine CSR culture by examining at the role of stakeholder demands in shaping the use of CSR by companies and the public debate on CSR. This will be achieved by comparing five different theories that aim to explain CSR through differing interpretations of the demands. These theories include the stakeholder approach and four varying argumentations within the business case for CSR. Therefore, this paper aims to answers the question, “To what extent are the established theories on Corporate Social Responsibility; the Stakeholder Approach and the Business Case for CSR, useful in explaining the Corporate Social Responsibility Culture of Iran?” by comparing the validity of the afore mentioned explanatory frameworks towards the CSR Culture in Iran. The author coins the term Corporate Social Responsibility culture (CSR culture) as a concept which summarizes the trends in the public debate on CSR in a region. The research indicates that the contemporary CSR culture in Iran can best be explained through the lens of the business case, as a “cost and risk reduction” oriented business tool. Similarly, to the trends visible in the debate on CSR, the thesis argues that in order to move towards a sustainable business culture in Iran, the Iranian state must use its unique position in its most important economic sector, the oil, gas, and petrochemical industry, in order to enforce higher standards in the field of environmental protection and social development.","['Corporate Social Responsibility', 'Corporate Social Responsibility Culture', 'Iran']"

Socialemediaredacteuren in Nederland: Een kwalitatief onderzoek naar een nieuwe journalistieke functie,"Schouten, Anna","['Pleijter, Alexander']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Sociale media hebben vandaag de dag een grote rol in het digitale medialandschap. Hier spelen journalistieke redacties, net als andere bedrijven, op in, om bijvoorbeeld voor meer publieksbereik te zorgen. Hieruit is de nieuwe journalistieke functie als socialemediaredacteur voortgekomen: een redacteur die zich in een afzonderlijke functie bezighoudt met de taken en processen op en rondom de socialemediakanalen die een redactie in gebruik heeft. In dit verkennende onderzoek is een studie uitgevoerd naar deze nieuwe journalistieke job, om de (Nederlandse) socialemediaredacteur in kaart te brengen. Aan de hand van een theoretisch kader is de basis gelegd voor het onderzoek naar de socialemediaredacteur. Hierbij staan vijf thema’s centraal: de achtergrond van de socialemediaredacteur; redactioneel socialemediagebruik door de socialemediaredacteur; werkzaamheden van de socialemediaredacteur; strategieën en richtlijnen; en houdingen van de socialemediaredacteur. Met deze brede onderwerpen is een analyse uitgevoerd naar verschillende aspecten die relevant zijn in de functie als socialemediaredacteur, om een zo volledig mogelijke definitie te schetsen. De vijf thema’s vormen tevens de rode draad bij de diepte-interviews die in dit kwalitatieve onderzoek zijn gehouden met veertien socialemediaredacteuren van verschillende nieuwsredacties in Nederland. Deze veertien redacteuren representeren een divers medialandschap, waarbij redacteuren van krantenredacties, omroepen en online only-redacties, en van zowel landelijke als regionale redacties zijn geïnterviewd. Uit de uitgebreide data die in dit onderzoek zijn verzameld, komen betreffende de vijf centrale thema’s verschillende bevindingen naar voren. Zo gaat het om een relatief homogene groep, waarbij overeenkomsten zijn in leeftijd, opleidingsniveau en -richting, eerdere werkervaringen, en het korte tijdsbestek in de huidige functie. Wat betreft de socialemediakanalen, werkzaamheden, en strategieën en richtlijnen hebben de socialemediaredacteuren te maken met uiteenlopende onderwerpen en processen, waarbij deze thema’s vaak samenhang vertonen. Dit maakt de functie uitdagend; er is flexibiliteit, innovatie en expertise nodig om alle onderwerpen aan elkaar te knopen. Hoewel naar voren komt dat de functie in vergelijking met bijvoorbeeld journalisten die onderzoek doen of artikelen schrijven minder inhoudelijk is, zijn beslist bepaalde capaciteiten benodigd om de functie op niveau uit te kunnen voeren, welke bij traditionelere journalistieke vormen veelal niet of in mindere mate van belang zijn. Hier komt dan ook bij dat een ruime meerderheid van de respondenten positief tegenover de inzet van socialemediajournalistiek en de functie als socialemediaredacteur staat en het idee aanhangt dat dit van waarde is, waarbij de job onder andere voldoening geeft gezien het vernieuwende karakter en de kansen die deze biedt op het gebied van het genereren van bereik en groei voor de redactie.","['journalistiek', 'onlinejournalistiek', 'sociale media', 'socialemediajournalistiek']"

To address this, previous years have witnessed the rise of ‘social entrepreneurship’ in sub-Sahara Africa. Incorporating a societal or environmental vision at its core, the social enterprise has the potential to be particularly effective in stimulating (local) economic growth. In their own environment, these social entrepreneurs face an array of unique challenges that ordinary Western business literature does not cover. This thesis makes a case to acknowledge the context in which these social entrepreneurs operate and investigates how they incorporate Western business tools in their own strategies. It also considers the importance of knowledge interpretation and creation and the influence of urbanization, globalization and digitalization on this process. The research questions are: How are Western business concepts and technologies interpreted and applied by local social entrepreneurs in Lagos, Nigeria and in what ways are they helpful in tackling the social entrepreneur’s unique challenges? Additionally, this thesis examines whether there are other sources from which local social entrepreneurs can derive strategies and tools in order to solve their problems and become more effective in creating impact. The findings, which are based on a single case study and a focus group discussion with several Lagos-based social entrepreneurs suggest that while Western business concepts can be very useful on some levels, the local social entrepreneurs have difficulty in effectively applying them to their own situation. Finally, the discoveries in this thesis suggest that African social entrepreneurs can tackle these challenges by creating, recording and sharing their own data and knowledge with each other in order to seize agency in the field of social entrepreneurship.","['Social Entrepreneurship in Africa', 'Lagos', 'Nigeria']"

To answer the question, the thesis was divided into three parts. Firstly, the state of the field was established in the literature review before giving an historical background on the Nixon Presidency, and more particularly, on the role this presidency played in the Vietnam War. The third chapter researches, using primary sources, whether or not the anti-war movement has changed Nixon’s decision to bomb North Vietnam again. The first Linebacker Operation had more support than the second campaign, but still received a lot of protests from the American people. The second Linebacker received a lot of protests, not only within the US itself, but also from other countries. Even though there were protests, they had little influence on Nixon’s decisions on his policy towards Vietnam.","['Linebacker operations', 'Vietnam War', 'United States involvement Vietnam', 'President Nixon', 'Henry Kissinger']"
Democracy beyond representation: Constructing modern democracy and the problems of representation,"Broersen, Pieter","['Fossen, Thomas']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"The democratic legitimacy of political representation is not obvious. In the literature, however, it is often treated as such, mostly because the alternative of direct democracy is deemed unfeasible. In this thesis, I approach this issue based on the fundamental critique of representation as made by Rousseau, according to which democracy and representation are mutually exclusive, and representative democracy thus a contradiction in terms. I compare Rousseau’s position, supported by a more modern argument by Hanna Pitkin, to an attempt by modern authors in defending representation, which started with David Plotke. I support Plotke’s ideas with those put forward by Nadia Urbinati and Mark Warren, and also look at a more extreme position as argued by Frank Ankersmit. Comparing these positions to the critique by Rousseau and Pitkin, it becomes clear that defence of representation is lacking democratic justification that can withstand Rousseau’s fundamental critique. Finally, I discuss a potentially strong argument at providing such a justification, based on arguments by Laura Montanaro and Clarissa Hayward, which emphasizes the constructive role that representation plays in the shaping of people’s interests. Until the representative turn provides a substantial argument that people do not have politically relevant interests prior to representation, I argue, Rousseau’s critique remains intact, and we need to be more careful in ascribing democratic properties to representative systems.","['Rousseau', 'Democracy', 'Representation', 'Representative turn', 'Representative democracy', 'Democratic legitimacy', 'Sovereignty', 'Direct democracy']"

This thesis aims to explore the role of identity politics in this foreign policy shift by assuming that such notions are influenced by the ‘identity dilemma’ left after the fall of the Soviet Union. Through a constructivist lens, this paper finds material as well as identity interests to be mutually constructive and employs this framework throughout. Three empirical chapters explore the relationship of Russia with one of its important regional partners and examine the decisions and motivations in the regions after the foreign policy shift. Through the analysis of Russian bilateral relations with the Middle East, Europe and China the thesis identifies three main trends influenced by identity politics namely, (1) the importance of Central Asia, (2) the use of energy as a method of achieving Great Power status and (3) the undying competition of Russia with its Western counterparts. From the research, the thesis finds that identity politics cannot be ignored, and has a position of importance Russian decision-making processes during and after the 2012 foreign policy shift.","['Identity Politics', 'Foreign Policy', 'Foreign Policy Shift', 'Russian Federation', 'Vladimir Putin', '2012 Foreign Policy Shift']"

"“It’s the (geo)economy, stupid!” An analysis of the rationales behind China’s mediation in the Yemeni conflict","Lanfranchi, Guido","['Forough, Mohammadbagher']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis analyzes China’s mediation efforts in the Yemeni conflict, and in particular the rationales behind Beijing’s approach. The analysis addresses the following question: how do China’s geoeconomic and geopolitical interests influence its approach to mediation efforts in Yemen? This question is tackled from two distinct but interrelated standpoints: from a geoeconomic perspective, the focus is on China’s interest in the shipping lines running through the Bab al-Mandeb strait; from a geopolitical perspective, the emphasis is on Beijing’s interest in balancing between Saudi Arabia an Iran when getting involved in the Yemeni conflict. The thesis relies on both qualitative and quantitative data, which is analyzed through the tool of process tracing. The analysis reveals that both geoeconomic and geopolitical interests have played a significant role in shaping China’s mediation efforts. Drawing on theoretical insights concerning the relation between geoeconomic and geopolitics, this thesis argues that geoeconomic interests should be considered as a major determinant of China’s mediation approach, due to the fact that geoeconomic interests are important determinants of geopolitical ones. An in-depth understanding of the rationales behind China’s mediation efforts in Yemen bears significance for broader debates on China’s increasing presence in the Middle East, especially in the times of the Belt and Road Initiative. The Asian Century is set to begin, and a thorough understanding of the rationales behind China’s policies would be a welcome development for academics and policymakers alike. ","['China', 'Yemen', 'geoeconomics', 'geopolitics', 'mediation']"

Multiculturalism in Japan: Intercultural Challenges in Anticipation of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics,"Baños Sánchez, Guillermo Manuel","['Mes, Thomas']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The present paper explores the myth of Japanese homogeneity in relation to current multicultural challenges existing in Japan and analyses them in contrast with the country’s endeavours in anticipation of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. In order to do so, fundamental theories on multiculturalism, nationalism, identity politics, and intercultural communication are first examined and then applied to the literature on the organisation of mega-events—such as the Olympics. The focus being on the case of the coming Tokyo Olympics, this paper has a more in-depth look at the current situation in terms of tourism and multiculturalism—briefly looking at the past Olympics celebrated in Tokyo 1964. Special attention is devoted to perceptions towards immigrants and foreigners in Japan, as well as the approaches and regulations taken by the government in terms of immigration, tourism, and hospitality, particularly regarding demographic and economic challenges. The final findings suggest that both political and social change are strongly interconnected and are equally crucial in achieving the goal of a more welcoming and accessible Olympics.","['Japan', 'Olympics', 'multiculturalism', 'nationalism', 'homogeneity', 'tourism', 'immigration']"
"Repatriation, Resettlement or Assimilation: The Protection Gap Linked to the Status of Palestinian Refugees","Kirschbaum, Maurice","['Ennis, Crystal']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The present Bachelor thesis looks at why refugees of Palestinian origin are treated differently from all other refugees and how this affects their rights. Palestinian refugees are the only group that has been specifically excluded from the protection and the rights stipulated in the 1951 Refugee Convention. Although their ongoing displacement clearly constitutes a protracted refugee situation, Palestinian refugees do not respond to three-step solution that the UNHCR pursues in such situations: assimilation, resettlement or repatriation. By resolution 194 the United Nations in 1948 enshrined the right of return for the Palestinian refugees and created a dedicated agency, the Conciliation Commission on Palestine (UNCCP), to assure the collective rights of Palestinians. The UNCCP has become obsolete over the years without being formally abandoned and the UNRWA, the Relief and Works Agency that is tasked with the delivery humanitarian assistance is facing increasing restrictions. Being tied to weak organisations that were meant to offer some sort of protection, many Palestinian refugees today have to face the dilemma that only collective rights, as stipulated in resolution 194, preserve their right of return. Upholding this collective claim means that they have to no access to individual rights and thus suffer from a protection gap that is ever growing.","['Palestine', 'refugee', 'migration', 'UNRWA', 'Protection Gap', 'UNCCP', 'Human Rights', 'Middle East', 'United Nations', 'Institutionalism']"

"Showing Our Grandeur: Elite Identity, Collective Memory, and Provincialisation in Late-Imperial Aphrodisias","Wang, Banban","['Tacoma, Laurens Ernst']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This Research Master Thesis focusses on the rich epigraphic corpus in the third- and fourth-century Aphrodisias. By examining the Aphrodisian corpus of inscriptions, this Thesis aims to explore how several elements, crucial to civic identity in the Principate, were used and adapted by different parties in Aphrodisias in the third- and fourth-century changing political and ideological landscape to position themselves within the city, within the surrounding area, and within the Empire. I attempt to consider external elements of inscriptions when offering interpretations. The Thesis shall present most of its studies in the form of case study. Chapter 1 focusses on the elements the Aphrodisian elite applied to represent their identity, and how they selected to represent themselves in such ways according to the context. It aims to show that the Aphrodisians inherited traditional ideas of the civic elite, but religious affiliations gradually became dominant. Chapter 2 offers a case study on the ‘Archival Wall’, one of the best examples of civic self-representation in the city. Regarding the Wall as consciously fabricated lieu de mémoire, the chapter argues that the city, as a whole, defined itself by the concept of liberty, the competition with the famous Asian cities, and the continuous friendship with Rome. The key question is why the Aphrodisians chose these documents in this specific time to set up a Wall. Chapter 3 examines how Aphrodisias and Aphrodisians found and expressed their new role when the city was provincialised.","['Aphrodisias', 'Late Antiquity', 'Greek Epigraphy', 'Identity', 'Civic Competition']"

"What causes China's foreign investments to have limited enduring and positive economic impacts on a host country, like Angola?","Buccheri, Bianca","['Shidiq, Rizal']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The scope of this research is to figure out why, despite all the “infrastructure for resources” kind of investments undertaken by the Chinese, Sub-Saharan countries have not yet solved their widespread poverty issue. More specifically, the focus will be on Angola; a country that experienced extraordinary GDP growth in the first years of the economic partnership with China, yet poverty among the population remains rampant. Therefore, in order to discover what might explain a lack of economic development in a particular country that receives a great amount of infrastructure-related investments from China, I will firstly list four aspects that have been claimed to be destructive for the sustainable economic development of a country. These are: the non-interference approach adopted by China, the Chinese companies’ hiring policy, the lack of good governance and the disadvantage of the resource curse, by which many African countries are affected. After that, I will analyse these aspects in the more specific case of Angola in order to investigate which obstacles are inhibiting its economic development in actuality. Finally, I will argue that if the Angolan government solves its governance issues and adopts adequate measures to change the structure of the national economy, then, China will presumably be able to provide good opportunities to further stimulate economic development. However, if nothing is changed at the governance level, it is very unlikely that an economic transformation will ever take place.","['China', 'Angola', 'Chinese foreign direct investments', 'Infrastructure for resources', 'Economic development']"

The times we live in. Witnessing the rise of fascism in Austria from 1930 to 1934,"Buchinger, Hannah M.","['Dassen, Patrick', 'Stargardt, Nicolas']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The experiences of contemporaries have been neglected in the research of the far-reach-ing changes in Austria in the early 1930s. With the historiography focussing on institutions and structures as well as mostly the time since 1933, significant gaps exist and underlying assump-tions which do not reflect the experiences of people living in the troubled times. In contrast, this thesis uses a bottom-up approach to unravel the lives of contemporaries, their hopes and fears and the impact of the various crises in politics, economics and identity from 1930 to 1934. It thus asks how ordinary members of society experienced their times and witnessed the slow slide towards fascism and how they reacted to it. Based on the accounts of seven diarists, these troubled times are analysed through the lenses of contemporaries writing soon after the events and often still under the impression of them. Hence, they paint unblurred pictures of their times influenced by their surroundings. Their views shed light on the past as it ‘actually was’ and unravel the stories beyond the institutions. The first chapter analyses the end of parliamentary democracy in Austria in 1934 as witnessed by the diarists with a focus on the turning point of February 1934. The second chapter situates the diarists within the political and financial crises of the violent times. Lastly, the third chapter looks at the profound unsolved questions of identity, linked to religion and political decisions within the framework of the diarists’ perceptions of the past. In this fascism in Austria is understood as existing in two similar yet distinct variants: clerical Austrofascism and Nazism. The former tried to establish itself foremost by eliminating its biggest enemy, the Socialists, at the same time as creating a collective identity based on religion, German nationalism and the Habsburg past. The diarists’ experiences change the external narrative especially in view of February 1934: they showed the necessity of reinterpreting February 1934 as the turning point in the timeline of Austrian history as which it was perceived in comparison to the Anschluss in 1938. Furthermore, the accounts revealed the interconnectedness of the many crises of their times and how these as well as the remembered past and anticipated future shaped their perceptions and everyday life. However, also the split into distinct ‘Lager’ and the thesis of Austrofascism op-posing the threat of Nazism have to be revisited. The latter was insofar challenged as the step from democracy to an authoritarian regime was seemingly more impacting the diarists’ lives than the step from one variant of fascism to another.","['fascism', 'diary', 'interwar years', 'Austria', 'ego-documents', '1934', 'Austrofascism', 'Nazism']"

"Kidnapping the Caucasus, Russian Style: Changing Constructions of Orientalist Discourse in Film","Sirotin, Sebastian","['Roberts, Flora']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Although the USSR often claimed to promote equality in relations with other peoples, this has frequently been shown to be untrue. Specifically, in the case of the USSR's relationship with the Caucasus through the use of Orientalist tropes. So, using Edward Said's theoretical framework of Orientalism, the question ""How have constructions of Orientalist discourses of the Caucasus changed from the Soviet Union to the Russian Federation?"" was investigated in the context of Leonid Gaidai's 1967 film ""Kidnapping, Caucasian Style"" and Alexei Uchitel's 2008 film ""Captive"". These constructions have primarily changed along 5 Orientalist tropes. First, tropes of 'backwardness' have remained, though they have shifted from a focus on lack of modern technologies and customs to tropes of either a disorganized band of people in some cases or a militant and violent group in others. Second, representations of alcoholism, as a means of showing a lack of faith in Islam as well as an overly textual approach to understanding it, have remained largely unchanged over time. Third, portrayals of the Caucasus as a feminized ""Other"" have changed over time. Although feminine aspects have remained as justifying Soviet and Russian intervention in the region. Fourth, the exotic aspect of the Caucasus, though very present in Soviet portrayals, has largely faded from Russian Orientalist representations. Finally, Soviet and, especially, Russian Orientalism portray the Caucasus as being in a state of nature, as a wild and mysterious land that is inherently hostile to Russians. Thus, although constructions of Orientalist discourse have changed in some aspects and remained similar in others, their use as a means of justifying Soviet and Russian presence remains strongly similar and Orientalist.","['Orientalism', 'Russia', 'USSR', 'Soviet', 'Film', 'Chechnya', 'Caucasus', 'Islam', 'neo-Orientalism']"
"Negotiating Statehood in de facto states: peace processes, de facto statehood and strategic interests in the Transnistrian de facto state","Tudose, Florentina Maria","['Skalamera, Morena']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has redirected the attention of scholars and political analysts towards the often-forgotten frozen conflicts, now, consolidated into functioning de facto states in the Post-Soviet region. The recent opening of the official diplomatic representation of Transnistria in Moscow has sparked a series of questions regarding the intentions of the de facto state and its patron, Russia. While other de facto states, such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been recognised and have established official diplomatic missions in Moscow since 2008, the PMR is only taking these steps now. These developments point to a new chapter for Transnistria and raise questions regarding the statehood of the de facto state. This thesis seeks to uncover the overarching mechanisms which foster the development of de facto statehood. Considering the ‘renewal’ of negotiations in the ‘5+2’ format and the declared progress made in in terms of the ‘policy of small steps’ in Transnistria, this is a good place to start. Hence, this thesis aims to explore the causal link between peace processes and de facto statehood.","['de facto states', 'Russia', 'statehood', 'Transnistria', 'strategic interests', 'peace processes']"

Rebel Governance and Self-Determination: The Cases of ISIS and Hezbollah,"Pizzichini, Enrico","['Calculli, Marina']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the international system, ISIS and Hezbollah are non-state actors involved in the power struggle characterizing the Middle East, and they found themselves opposed in the Syrian Civil War since 2011. Although they are different by virtue of their confessional identity, they share multiple similarities. Both are the product of the international intervention in Iraq/Syria and Lebanon; both share, until recently, a powerful military apparatus as well as a functional organizational system; both are recognised as terrorist or criminal organization by part of the international community. They share another characteristic too: the pursuit of the Islamic State, a utopia rooted in the teachings of the Qu’ran and Mohammad that calls for the demise of the Western-type of state in the Middle East. Nevertheless, their ideals of Islamic State are essentially different, and different are their historical and political contexts as well as their ideological motivations. One group has declared the Islamic State whereas the other has not. This work aims to unravel under what conditions non-state armed groups claim territorial sovereignty. Consequently, ISIS and Hezbollah are two cases subjected to deep analysis. Building on the concept of rebel governance, I argue that rebel’s strategies are affected respectively by the place and time-frame but mostly by the group’s relationship with the population, other armed groups, and the international community. Notwithstanding, ideology is still the building block of the rebel’s approach. I sustain that historical and political developments have structured the actors’ ideologies which in turn have affected their approaches and consequently the self-determination claim. The difference in the outputs then lies in the ideological and socio-political divide between ISIS and Hezbollah. The contrasting developments of these groups, which replied differently to national and international menaces, and their different regional priorities, as well as their distant ideas of Islamic State, allow us to understand what led to the creation of the “Islamic State of Iraq and Syria” and the “Party of God”. Inter alia, how the refusal of any compromise and the creation of a new Sunni identity rejecting the nation-state favoured the self-determination, whereas the entry into politics to gain resilience from a plethora of confessional realities has suggested the suspension of the Islamic State.","['International Relations', 'Rebel Governance', 'Self-Determination', 'ISIS', 'Hezbollah']"

Caught in The Net: An Investigation into NGO Development Interventions Targeting Coastal Fish-smokers in Ghana,"Evans, Aincre","['Akinyoade, Akinyinka']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Fish-smoking is a popular post-harvest preservation method in Ghana, predominantly carried out by women in fishing communities. NGOs and researchers in Ghana in the 1950s identified a range of adverse health risks in local fish-smoking oven technologies that place fish-smokers at risk. The main approach that has been adopted to combat these risks has been through developing new fish-smoking oven technology, which is being distributed across Ghana by NGOs. This research paper aimed to contribute an alternative understanding of these NGO approaches in Ghana through investigating the level of participation within NGO interventions and by drawing attention to gender dynamics that frame fish-smoker’s agency. Through conducting research at fish-smoking sites in Jamestown, Greater Accra, this paper’s findings demonstrate how fish-smoker’s participation and inclusion in NGO interventions are limited, leaving fish smokers hesitant to adopt NGO distributed oven technologies. Drawing from key theory around participation and Gender and Development, this paper stresses the dynamic interplay between participation and gender within NGO fish-smoking oven interventions and the far-reaching implications for women’s collective success in the Ghanaian fish-smoking industry. This study’s conclusions suggest that alternative approaches, which consider the role of gender in the fisheries value chain more closely, could result in more transformative interventions for fish-smokers in Ghana.","['Gender analysis', 'Fisheries', 'Value chain', 'Participation', 'Research', 'Ghana', 'Gender']"
They Were Also Humans: On the Dehumanising Nature of Photographic and Filmic Portrayals of Egyptian Mummies,"Sallam, Sara","['Shobeiri, Ali']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The ancient Egyptian mummies have been extensively portrayed throughout history, since the early inceptions of photography and cinema, and remain popular in visual culture. Certain ways of portraying them have been repeatedly followed like traditions, which resulted in establishing stereotypes. In this thesis, I investigate how some of these recurring portrayals dehumanise the ancient Egyptians. For this purpose, I have compiled an archive of photographs and films, and analysed their stereotypical portrayal patterns. In doing so, I have identified two traditions; the portrayal of mummies in non-fictional photographs as artefacts (artefication), and their portrayal in fictional films as monsters (monstrification). In two visual essays accompanying this thesis, I demonstrate how these traditions systematically deny the portrayed mummies essentially and uniquely human qualities, resulting in their dehumanisation. Further, I discuss their spectacularisation — inherent in their artefication and monstrification— and the mode of spectatorship evoked by the mummified body as a spectacle. The thesis thus aims to offer a critique on dehumanising portrayals of the ancient Egyptians, shedding light on the repercussions of the encounter with such images.","['Dehumanisation', 'Artefact', 'Monster', 'Spectacle', 'Archive', 'Egyptian Mummy']"

Their research has studied the different means of strengthening the performative potential in Old English wills, along the lines of speech act theory and discourse analysis. This study will do the same but focus on manumissions. The literate practice of vesting written texts with performative power was still developing during the tenth century, which is visible in the Bodmin manumission documents. These documents incorporate both oral and literate elements into their text, which demonstrates that while not fully trusted yet, the written word was slowly gaining ground.","['orality', 'literacy', 'manumissions']"

In addition, the CSDP has been criticized by scholars for its ineffectiveness for various reasons. This thesis prioritizes the argument that the CSDP lacks effectiveness due to institutional defects. Furthermore, initiatives have been implemented as a result of the EUGS and the IPSD. These institutional constructs may influence the CSDP’s ineffectiveness. Within academic literature, however, research is lacking concerning the impact of the initiatives of the IPSD on the CSDP. Therefore, this thesis aims to answer the question of how the EU has addressed the criticisms concerning the CSDP. The theoretical foundation of this thesis is rational-choice institutionalism, and is conducted on the basis of a triangulated study. First of all, the correspondence between the EUGS and the IPSD has been examined. Thereafter, it has been researched how the IPSD addresses the scholarly criticisms concerning its institutional defects. It is concluded that with the implementation of the IPSD, the EU has not been able to address all the scholarly criticisms. The plan has addressed the criticisms concerning the lack of capacities, and also the ability to ensure compliance in generating resources. Furthermore, the issue concerning the absence of military headquarters has been addressed as well. Finally, it is argued that the initiatives may have created the opportunity to increase the CSDP’s effectiveness indirectly.","['Common Security and Defence Policy', 'European Union Global Strategy', 'Implementation Plan on Security and Defence', 'Effectiveness', 'European Union']"

The African Union's self-conception as a peace actor: a role theory approach,"Land, Hans van 't","['Karen, Smith']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The African Union emerged in 2002, and presents itself to the world as Africa’s peace actor. Its expressions contain Pan-African ideals, and the conviction that peace and security are main prerequisites for a prosperous future. Most AU-studies regard the question if AU’s peacekeeping efforts in interventions are successful, or investigate how states harm the continental endeavour. They conclude that the PSC lacks structural and incidental capacity and political willingness of states. This approach and outcome fits to the dominant realist approach, assuming that the African Union consists of power-seeking states, looking after their interests. This thesis contributes to this debate by utilizing another, constructivist approach. Role theory advances the understanding of this peace actor. The performance of the AU in peace policy, and the position of member states is investigated in the context of role-conception, role-contestation and role-expectations. In this thesis the AU’s role-conception, and how it develops, is central. The definition of this role was not given yet in the CA, although some ingredients where in there. The contestation by states and AU-institutions shaped the self-conception of the AU, and stimulated the policy of prevention. The expectations of others, in particular international financial partners, have had significant influence on the AU. The UN requires IOs to take responsibility in building peace in their region, and pays for AU-led missions. The political and social contexts cause, by a process of socialization, a dynamic and continuously developing self-conception of the AU. The current self-conception of the AU is being a comprehensive power. It deploys troops in African conflict areas as a military power. However, it performed also as a civil power by promoting and supporting CSOs; and even as normative power, by emphasizing the responsibilities for states to secure their people (policy of indifference).","['African Union', 'peace actor', 'conflict', 'role theory', 'self conception']"

"Competing, Feasting, and Preaching: Missionaries and Social Mobility in Eastern Indonesia during the 19th century","Linde, Sebastiaan","['Schrikker, Alicia']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis focused on the question of how it had been possible for Europeans to become ‘white rajas’ in eastern Indonesian contexts. In order to answer this question, I have conducted a microhistorical study on the ‘social life’ of the ‘successful’ missionary Ernst Steller, who had been working on the island of Sangihe Besar. Ernst Steller eventually managed to acquire significant social status in local society, an extraordinary large following, access to a large free labour force, a large plantation, and eventually the ability to dominate local chiefly politics. In order to explain Ernst Steller’s political, social and economic rise, I have utilized Tony Ballantyne’s concept of ‘imperial entanglement’, which positions the missionary as a dependent social actor within local society. As Ernst Steller had been largely dependent on local elites, he became a part of local society, and had to adapt to local culture and institutions. Ernst Steller actively participated in the competitive and ritualistic politics of Sangihe Besar – in the process adapting and manipulating local cultural conceptions and institutions in order to achieve his own goals. Due to his connections to the Netherlands and the Dutch colonial state, Ernst Steller eventually managed to gain an edge over the local elites. Ultimately, Ernst Steller became one of the dominant figures in the Sangirese political arena, together with a small number of European actors who had used similar ways to acquire their political, social and economic positions. These ‘white rajas’ competed amongst each other, perpetuating the competitive and ritualistic political culture of Sangihe Besar. This thesis has demonstrated that 1) missionaries had – given the right political and social circumstances – been able to transform their dependent social positions into positions of political power, and 2) social mobility in Sangirese contexts greatly resembled processes of social mobility in both eastern Indonesian and Melanesian contexts.","['Social Mobility', 'Entanglement', 'Missionaries', 'Ernst Steller', 'Dutch Empire', 'Sangirese world', 'Sangirese ethnohistory', 'Historical anthropology', 'Pacific Studies', 'Southeast Asian Studies', 'Religion', 'Redistributive Status Feasts', 'Man of Prowess', 'Big Man', 'Charismatic Leadership', 'Control over labour', 'Localisation', 'North Sulawesi', 'Southeast Asian-Melanesian Connections', 'Early Colonialism', 'Sangihe Besar', 'Competitive behaviour', 'Social competition', 'White rajas', ""Southeast Asia's Pacific Rimlands""]"
Challenging a Western Narrative: How the Washington Redskins influences the Traumatic Memory of Native Americans.,"Goedhuys, Joris","['Polak, Sara']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Native American logos, mascots, and slang names in sport contribute negatively to the traumatic memory of Native Americans. The stereotypical nature of these logos force the Native American community not only to adhere to a western view of Native Americans, but it also undermines Native Americans to actively retell their own story and therefore change this western view. This thesis contributes to the academic discussion by showing the case of the NFL-team The Washington Redskins. By analysing the logo and name of The Washington Redskins, this thesis shows how this team contributes negatively to the traumatic memory of Native Americans. As a conclusion, this thesis argues that, first of all, the stereotypical logo and name of The Washington Redskins change the narrative memory of Native Americans. Second of all, the commodification of the logo and name together with Barthes concept of myth keep the Native American community from telling their own narrative. To give the Native American community the chance to heal their traumatic memory, Native American logos, mascots, and slang names should therefore be excluded from not only sport, but from all media that includes these stereotypes.",

Authoritarian Stability and Out-Group Survival,"Gayed, Maria","['Maat, Eelco van der']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to show how authoritarian regimes opt for using small-scale violence against minority out-groups to counteract any regime instability. Essentially it argues that authoritarian leaders change out-group treatment according to the needs of their stability. It is a within-case study, focused on the Coptic christian minority in Egypt. It traces the treatment of Copts under Sadat and under Mubarak. The thesis found that the biggest need or factor in determining out-group treatment is domestic legitimacy. By bringing various theories on authoritarian regimes and minority treatment together, this thesis proposes the stoking fire theory. By allowing violence to be perpetrated against minority groups, regimes stoke a small fire and keep it burning for a regime's own survival. It is the first step in arguing that low-level violence, perpetrated by state and citizen, is used for strategic purposes, as others have argued for mass violence. The insights in the nexus between the three factors (domestic legitimacy, an out-groups refusal to be co-opted and external support) for out-group treatment can help foreign policy makers in determining finding the best timing to pressure regimes for democratization, if that is truly their pursuit, and when to support an out-group without becoming the topic of rumored ‘evil’ relations between out-group and democratic supporter. More importantly, by understanding how their position is used by autocrats, out-groups may better understand their predicament at a given time. Understanding their behavior and the changing needs of an authoritarian regime, they may be better able to see increased violence coming, giving them the chance to defend themselves against it.","['authoritarianism', 'out-group survival', 'minorities', 'violence', 'regime survival', 'egypt', 'religious minority', 'mubarak', 'sadat', 'Coptic Orthodoxy']"

A Path Dependency for Turkey's European Union Membership,"Zandstra, Lily","['Duzgun, Eren']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Parallels have been drawn between a catholic marriage and the relationship between the EU and Turkey. Every time the relationship appears to be on the brink of divorce a closer step towards Turkey's accession is made. In this sense, the EU-Turkey relationship is in historical institutionalist terms path dependent. The institutionalisation of this relationship has meant that divorce incurs a high cost and is, therefore, unlikely to happen. Theoretical explanations have been given for and against Turkey's accession, but these are unable to explain the fluidity of this relationship. Concentrating on history and how arguments are historically and contextually conditioned, this thesis incorporates a historical institutionalist framework to explain the decision-making by the EU in deepening its path dependent relationship with Turkey in order to aid in understanding EU enlargement and in particular Turkey's EU accession process. Two critical junctures of the periods from 1997-1999 and 2011-2016 will be analysed to reveal the central elements which explain the EU's decision-making. This analysis will examine EU documents concerning Turkish accession such as presidency conclusions, statements of the EU Heads of State or Government and international agreements between Turkey and the EU. In addition, this research will also draw on the already existing academic literature and use statements from the media and from leading figures to reflect on Turkey's accession. Through using a historical institutionalist approach this thesis makes an original contribution in arguing that Europe's enlargement approach has become vulnerable to reverse conditionality, fostering a path dependent relationship. The EU sees Turkey as a strategic ally rather than as an equal partner. Enlargement in the case of Turkey was initially used to incentivise Turkey to cooperate and has, therefore, been the EU's most powerful source of leverage. However, this use of enlargement has made the EU vulnerable to the implementation of reverse conditionality. As soon as accession loses its significance divorce could be immanent unless the couple can find a compromise to settle on a different kind of relationship.","['EU', 'Turkey', 'Englargement', 'Historical Institutionalism', 'Reverse Conditionality', 'Path Dependency', 'EU Accession']"
