"Insularity and Maritime framing in Northern Europe: The shaping of early modern notions concerning islands, isolation and connectivity by Olaus Magnus 1535-1555","Jong, Zeno de","['Sicking, Louis']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research shows how notions of insularity and the role of islands within the maritime systems of Northern Europe were thought of and consolidated during the Early Modern period. Northern Europe experienced transitions on economic and cultural levels. The Swedish scholar and ecclesiast in exile, Olaus Magnus, brought forth a representation concerning the Northern lands encompassing tradition, politics, heritage and Scandinavian culture into his work. Firstly by his map the 'Carta Marina' published in 1539 and later on with his chronicle the 'History of the Nordic Peoples' published in 1555. By linking Olaus' representation of islands with the historiograhpical insular discourse concerning islands resembling either isolation or connectivity, the way these islands were implemented into the maritime networks of Europe shows what purpose they fulfilled as well as how this adhered to their conceptualization. Islands before thought of as isolated can be viewed as tied into European maritime systems through Olaus Magnus' map and chronicle.","['Islands', 'Iceland', 'Olaus Magnus', 'Early Modern', 'isolation', 'Maritime connectivity', 'Representation', 'Cartography', 'medieval chronicle', 'Northern Europe', 'Northern Atlantic Ocean', 'Maritime framing', 'Maritime history', 'ethnography']"

Painting the Palaces: Studying the Transference of Artistic Motifs and the International Style in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Middle and Late Bronze Age,"Hamer, Marijke van den","['Naerebout, F.G.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"In a globalizing world, where experiencing new cultures is on a lot of bucket lists, the study of cultural interaction has become very popular. In our modern day and age, we like to project this etic phenomenon of our modern day globalization onto the ancient world. And not without avail, research has found that cultural interaction did indeed take place in the ancient world, although we need to keep in mind that the emic perspective might have been a bit different from our own. A lot of intercultural interaction took place in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Bronze Age. During this period ships filled with luxurious gifts and exotic merchandise were plying the seas. However, this transfer of material culture did not only occur through trade or gift exchange, but also through warfare and travelling craftsmen. The transfer of non-material culture also took place, for example through the transfer of techniques and ideas. This could also take the form of motif transference. This thesis examines the phenomenon of motif transference between the Aegean, the Near East and Egypt during the Bronze Age. Besides the acculturation between two cultures, it is also possible for cultural interaction to take place between three or more cultures. This is reflected in the art of the Bronze Age, in which some motifs were shared by the artistic traditions of the Aegean, the Near East and Egypt. The transfer in style as well as technology and iconography created a new level of hybridity that lasted until the end of the Late Bronze Age and which is often called the international style. But the objects which are considered to belong to the international style, were not the only ones displaying a common style. Throughout the Eastern Mediterranean frescoes were found with motifs from the Aegean artistic tradition, which were produced during the Middle and Late Bronze Age. They are found in geographically important cities, which were located along important trade routes. These paintings were found at Alalakh, Miletus and Hattusa in Turkey, Qatna in Syria, Tel Kabri in Israel, Tell el-Dab’a, Malkata and Amarna in Egypt and display hybrid influences in iconography as well as technology. The goal of this thesis is to determine if the much-debated international style at present has a too narrow definition, which might need to be expanded to include these frescoes. This study tries to determine whether or not the palatial art found in the Eastern Mediterranean can be seen as a part of the international style.","['International Style', 'Aegean art', 'Egypt', 'Syria', 'Israel', 'Artistic motifs', 'Crete', 'Minoan', 'Turkey']"

"Euroscepticus sinds jaar en dag? De rol van Margaret Thatcher in de totstandkoming van euroscepsis binnen de Conservative Party, 1981-1999","Koster, Ayrton Samuël","['Augusteijn, Joost']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Hoe kan het zo zijn dat de Conservative Party in de jaren ’60 en ’70 vrijwel onverdeeld pro-EEG was, maar dat euroscepsis vandaag de dag een prominent deel is van de partijideologie? Dit onderzoek richt zich op de rol die Margaret Thatcher in de ontwikkeling van euroscepsis binnen haar partij speelde. Aanvankelijk was Thatcher net zo pro-EEG als haar partijgenoten, zij het enkel uit neoliberale bewegingen. Zodra Thatcher in 1988 echter inzag dat de voorzitter van de Europese Commissie, Jacques Delors, inzette op niet alleen een gezamenlijke Europese markt, maar ook op zoveel mogelijk gezamenlijk Europees politiek beleid, kreeg ze in vrij korte tijd een grote afkeer van de EEG. Met haar plots ingezette ramkoers genereerde ze zowel eurosceptische aanhang als EEG-gezinde tegenstanders binnen haar partij. John Major volgde Thatcher in 1990 op als premier en erfde een partij die erg verdeeld was geraakt over Europa. Tijdens zijn premierschap was er onder eurosceptische Conservatives, die achter de schermen door Thatcher tegen Major werden opgezet, zeer grote weerstand tegen de EMU en het Verdrag van Maastricht. Zodra dit verdrag was geratificeerd, schoot de door Thatcher gegenereerde euroscepsis ook buiten de Conservative Party wortel, met name in de Referendum Party en UKIP.","['Thatcher, Margaret (1926-2013)', 'Euroscepsis', 'Conservative Party', 'Verenigd Koninkrijk', 'Delors, Jacques (1925)', 'Europese Monetaire Unie', 'Verdrag van Maastricht', 'Major, John (1943)']"
TPP: Chile's Remedy or Destiny?,"Smidt, Having Sjoerd","['Foulon, M.W.B.', 'Gawthorpe, A.J.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Chile signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement in February 2016 with twelve other countries from the Pacific Rim. As the only country with trade agreements in affect with all participating countries and the grandeur of the economic, political and substantive scope of the TPP, some concerns were raised as to whether it was beneficial for Chile to join. For this, I analysed the domestic affairs that may have played a role during the negotiations. It became apparent that political leaders and business groups were able to directly influence the negotiations in which they believed the TPP could serve to solidify relations with the Asia-Pacific for the copper industry and enter higher value chains, in order to counter the inequality causing much societal unrest. As the continuous pushing of the neoliberal agenda shows whilst civil society groups opposed this, the failing cooperation between the different sectors of Chile becomes apparent. This confirms the theory of Katzenstein (1985) that small states need strong social policies if it wants to be successful in the international arena. Next to that, this thesis has shown that it is important to look at the domestic affairs of a country to understand its international behaviour.",['Chile TPP Trade International Relations Politics Domest Affairs']

Het grafmonument van Dirk van Assendelft en Adriana van Nassau in de Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk te Breda,"Andrik, Christel","['Hartog, Elizabeth den']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Het grafmonument van Dirk van Assendelft en Adriana van Nassau in de Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk te Breda - Samenvatting. Er is onduidelijkheid betreffende de kunstenaar die verantwoordelijk is voor het ontwerp en uitvoeren van het grafmonument voor Dirk van Assendelft en Adriana van Nassau in de Grote of Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk te Breda. Aan de hand van een analyse van de compositie, de toegepaste ornamenten en de gebruikte materialen wordt onderzocht wat de naam van de beeldhouwer is. Het Van Assendelft epitaaf (1555) bevindt zich aan de noordzijde van het schip op de westelijke zijmuur van de voormalige kapel van St. Franciscus. De keuze om het epitaaf op de westelijke zijmuur te plaatsen is opmerkelijk, aangezien de kerkgangers er nu met hun rug naar toe zitten gedraaid. Opvallend is bovendien dat het Van Assendelft epitaaf vrij ver verwijderd van de andere grafmonumenten in de Grote Kerk, die zich in de kooromgang en Prinsenkapel bevinden, hangt. Het monument bestaat uit drie niveaus, die zich naar boven toe versmallen. Het valt gelijk op dat het epitaaf erg hoog hangt, waardoor de reliëfs op zowel de onderste als tweede laag niet goed tot hun recht komen. Bij een nadere beschouwing blijkt het epitaaf zelf vreemd in elkaar te zitten. In de onderste laag zijn de albasten figuren van Dirk van Assendelft (1498-1553) en Adriana van Nassau (1507- 1558) in knielende houding vormgegeven, waarbij opvalt dat beide echtelieden niet goed in de omlijstende nis van Baumberger steen lijken te passen (hetgeen in de hoofdstuk drie uitgelegd gaat worden). Ook het ontbreken van een stilistische eenheid in het monument komt hier ter sprake. Tenslotte is het grafmonument in zijn totaliteit niet geheel symmetrisch; aan de rechterzijde, waar het epitaaf tegen de buitenmuur ‘rust’, lijkt een deel te zijn weggehaald zodat het in de kapel ‘past’. Waarschijnlijk is het monument voor een andere plaats in de kerk bedoeld geweest, hetgeen in het laatste deel van de scriptie wordt toegelicht. Eveneens wordt er een, met argumenten onderbouwd, alternatief aangereikt voor de mogelijke locatie van het epitaaf in de Grote Kerk. In de literatuur wordt het grafmonument voor Van Assendelft door Hedicke, Van Wezel en Scholten aan Cornelis Floris (1514-1575) toegewezen. Huysmans geeft aan dat ze de door Hedicke gebruikte argumenten om het epitaaf voor Van Assendelft aan Floris toe te schrijven op te weinig argumenten vindt berusten. Zij vraagt zich af of het Van Assendelft epitaaf daadwerkelijk van zijn hand is aangezien er een probleem is ten aanzien van de eigenhandigheid van Floris’ werken, hetgeen ook speelt bij de kleinere, niet-gedocumenteerde epitafen. Het is eveneens mogelijk dat de ideeën van Floris zijn overgenomen door andere kunstenaars, die gebruik maakten van een in 1557 verschenen serie van ontwerpen, uitgegeven door H. Cock te Antwerpen, waar Cornelis Floris deel van uitmaakte. Om meer duidelijkheid te krijgen over de achterliggende gedachte om het epitaaf de huidige vormgeving te geven, luidt mijn onderzoeksvraag: Wat is de reden dat de albasten sculpturen van het epitaaf voor Dirk van Assendelft en zijn vrouw Adriana van Nassau in de Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk in Breda te groot zijn ten opzichte van de stenen nis? Welke kunstenaar heeft dit epitaaf ontworpen? Kan dit epitaaf aan het oeuvre van Cornelis Floris toegevoegd worden of is een andere kunstenaar, die op dat moment actief was in Breda, de beeldhouwer? Om te kunnen bepalen of de stilistische en compositorische karakteristieken van het werk van Cornelis Floris terug te zien zijn bij het epitaaf van Dirk van Assendelft en Adriana van Nassau wordt er van de gedocumenteerde werken van Floris een uitvoerige beschrijving en datering gegeven en vervolgens vergeleken met het epitaaf van Van Assendelft. Bovendien wordt er ingegaan op de betekenis van grafmonumenten in de late middeleeuwen en wordt er een beeld geschetst krijgen van de gememoreerden: Dirk van Assendelft en zijn vrouw Adriana van Nassau. Wat heeft hen bewogen om het oudtestamentische verhaal van de Koperen Slang te kiezen?","['Assendelft', 'Van Nassau', 'epitaaf', 'Grote Kerk Breda', 'Cornelis Floris', 'grafmonument', 'Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk Breda']"

The possibility of using differentiation to better control irregular migration into the European Union,"Evers, Aaron","['Krop, Marnix']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The EU has not succeeded in developing a uniform approach in response to the exceptionally high number of asylum seekers entering Europe. Instead, the EU’s recent handling of irregular migration has been marked by unilateral action, mutual accusations and political deadlock. Moreover, the European migration crisis of 2015 has demonstrated that the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) is unable to handle migratory pressure and actually stimulates secondary movements. However, the current East-West divide prevents the emergence of any meaningful compromise that would allow the CEAS to be successfully reformed. For this reason, the question examined by this thesis is whether the CEAS can be reformed through using differentiation and if so, how and to what extent this would be possible. In order to answer this question, three topics surrounding EU asylum and migration policy are discussed, i.e. Schengen, external border management and the relocation program. The analysis of this thesis concludes that differentiation cannot be applied to Schengen and is not required to enhance external border management because of an emerging consensus. Still, differentiation does have the potential to improve the functioning of the relocation program but this would require member states to centralize their asylum policies, something that is unlikely to happen in the near future. Even so, a coalition of the willing should aim to reform the CEAS into a centralized EU asylum system because only then will the EU be able to effectively control high levels of irregular migration into Europe.","['European Union', 'Irregular Migration', 'EU Asylum Policy', 'Differentiation', 'Migration Crisis', 'CEAS']"

Emotietheater Op zoek naar emotie in het theater tussen middeleeuwen en vroegmoderne tijd,"Vergeer, Timothy","['Anrooij, Wim van']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Theater is een kunstvorm die het meeste effect heeft in de uitvoering. In de vijftiende, zestiende en zeventiende eeuw was theater het genre bij uitstek dat ingezet werd door overheden en door opiniemakers om de gemoederen te beïnvloeden. In de Nederlanden waren het de rederijkers die deze rol op zich namen en de grootschalige stedelijke evenementen organiseerden. Rederijkerstoneel stond garant voor spektakel, maar maakte tegelijk ook een duidelijke ontwikkeling door van vertogen naar vertonen. Maar daar ligt ook meteen het grootste probleem: hoe kun je een uitvoering analyseren die vierhonderd, vijfhonderd of zelfs zeshonderd jaar geleden heeft plaatsgevonden? Hoe kun je het effect van deze grootscheepse ondernemingen herkennen en duiden? En is het dan vervolgens mogelijk om een ontwikkeling in toneelpraktijk in kaart te brengen? Het antwoord op al deze vragen lijkt zo gegeven: dat is onmogelijk. In deze masterscriptie staan juist deze vragen centraal. Het is het doel van deze scriptie om 1) op zoek te gaan naar aanknopingspunten voor de emotionaliteit, en dus het effect, van rederijkerstoneel en de daarbij behorende toneelpraktijk. 2) de veranderingen en constanten in de toneelpraktijk tussen middeleeuwen en vroegmoderne tijd te herkennen en te duiden wat betreft de uitbeelding van emoties 3) uiteindelijk de vraag te beantwoorden emotie in Nederlandstalig toneel werd vormgegeven in de overgang tussen middeleeuwen en vroegmoderne tijd.","['Antwerpen', 'Jan Smeken', 'Cornelis van Ghistele', 'Guilliam van Nieuwelandt', 'History of Emotions', 'Toneel', 'zestiende eeuw (16e eeuw)', 'zeventiende eeuw (17e eeuw)', 'Emotives', 'Emotional regime']"

Curating Difference: An Analysis of Contemporary Curatorial Practices in the Context of Indigenous Australian Art - Burgeoning Strategies in the Modes of Address,"Florander, Sarah Benedicte","['Zijlmans, C.J.M.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since entering the international fine arts market in the 1970s, Indigenous Australian art has long contended with its positioning within a system that — until very recently — was ascribed to an exhibitionary method based on Western epistemology only. Debates surrounding the display of so-called ‘non-Western’ art and its place in modernity and the fine arts institution have produced several responses in the form of curatorial strategies. These strategies have emerged both in light of an increasing public awareness of the role of the curator in the representation of culture, and in the context of the museum as an inherently contentious space of knowledge construction. This thesis centres on the identification of these strategies, and its usage in four case studies. These case studies include the exhibitions fluent (1997), held at the 47th Venice Biennale, Theme Park (2008) at the Museum of Contemporary Aboriginal Art (AAMU), Indigenous Australia: Enduring Civilisation (2015), held at the British Museum and Frontier Imaginaries (2015 - ongoing), a travelling exhibition. By evaluating the applications of these strategies, this thesis sheds light on the manner in which curatorial strategies have formed the display of contemporary Indigenous art, and further highlights potentially impactful developments in the field of contemporary curation.","['curatorial studies', 'Indigenous art', 'colonial collections', 'contemporary art', 'exhibition strategy', 'modes of address']"

Perceptions of the Other can play a role in the way we engage with them, and those perceptions can be partially shaped by the images of the Other constructed by the media. This thesis discusses how one particular medium, video games, contributes to the perception and misperception of Russia by asking, what image of Russia and Russians do American-made video games construct, and how is it constructed? It examines and analyses two case studies, two popular video game trilogies, and concludes that the games’ gameplay, game-world and game-structure construct a Russia that is imperialist, immoral and cruel, hardly different from the Soviet Union that came before. Russians are frequently stereotyped as mindless patriots, unified in their love for “Mother Russia” and in their hatred for the West, especially America. Such depictions can be a contributing factor in the shaping of public and decision-makers’ perceptions of Russia as a threat to the West.","['Russia', 'video games', 'perceptions', 'Cold War', 'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare', 'Command & Conquer: Red Alert']"
"Brazilian Bergamasch: an Italian language spoken in Botuverá (Santa Catarina, Brazil)","Paganessi, Giulia","['Crevels, Mily']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis proposes a sketch description of Brazilian Bergamasch, a Gallo-Italian language spoken in the town of Botuverá, in the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. Brazilian Bergamasch is a non-standard variety of Bergamasch, an Italian language currently spoken in the Italian region of Lombardy, which was brought to Brazil by Italian immigrants in the late 19th century. This thesis has two main goals. Firstly, it aims to provide a grammatical and sociolinguistic sketch of the language, since Brazilian Bergamasch is currently undescribed. The description focuses on the analysis of the sociolinguistic situation present in the community, as well as on the main linguistic structures of the language (lexicon, phonology, morphology, syntax). In both cases, emphasis is given to the features that diverge from the standard variety spoken in Italy. On the basis of numerous discrepancies due to the geographic origins of the community founders on the one hand, and language internal and contact induced change on the other hand, it is argued that Brazilian Bergamasch can in fact be classified as a linguistic system independent from Standard Bergamasch. Secondly, the thesis provides a short wordlist of the basic lexicon of the language. The wordlist, which counts around 770 items, is organized by semantic fields and aims to contribute to projects of language maintenance that are currently being discussed and implemented by the community.","['Italian dialectology', 'Language contact', 'Grammar sketch', 'Immigration language']"
The Progressive in the Personal Correspondence of Charlotte Brontë,"Pennock, Barbara","['Caon, L.M.D.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Studies on Charlotte Brontë have focused on her personal life (Peters, 1975; Thörmahlen, 2012), her letter writing (Brontë, Smith ed., 1995–2000) and her work as an author. Her novel Jane Eyre (1847) was even included in a study investigating the use of the progressive during the nineteenth century (Arnaud, 1998). Although Arnaud’s study incorporated both novels and personal correspondence of contemporary authors, it excluded her letters. This thesis examines Brontë’s usage of the progressive in her letters exchanged with four members of her social network. Moreover, the investigation considers other contexts, such as formal and informal relations, as well as the gender of the recipients. Instances of the progressive were measured in terms of density, a method of normalization. This study finds evidence which supports the notion that the author’s use of the ‘be +-ing’ construction was likely to have been influenced by her second social network. Moreover, it indicates that her usage became more systematic during the final period of her life. The gender comparison shows that she used most progressive forms in letters addressed to women, than to men. Such usage of the construction correlates with female progressive usage of the nineteenth century (Arnaud, 1998, p. 131). However, the low use of the progressive in letters to men might indicate that Brontë adopted male ‘linguistic behaviour’ (Tieken-Boon van Ostade, 2009, pp. 114–115) as a result of her work as an author and her interaction with multiple social networks.","['Progressive', 'Personal Correspondence', 'Charlotte Brontë']"

The Space of Χώρα: A Perspective on Contemporary Art,"Buzhashka, Iva Boykova","['Zwijnenberg, Robert']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"The thesis proposes a perspective on contemporary visual arts through the viewpoint of Plato’s notion of χώρα (chôra) – a concept, which in Plato’s philosophy is defined as a third kind of being and is designated as a space between the World of Being and the World of Becoming, necessary for the world to originate and become manifested. The text engages with the idea of χώρα in Plato’s dialogue Timaeus, the understanding of the concept in contemporary thought in the work of the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Julia Kristeva, and investigates two distinct yet interconnected artworks – HAEM Blood Bound (2016) by Cecilia Jonsson and Cracks in Time (2009) by Michal Rovner, through the viewpoint of χώρα. In the text, art is considered equal to χώρα, as, it is argued, approaching the main features of Plato’s receptacle – the crucial aspects of ontology, motility and ‘in-betweenness’ as art characteristics could enable a rediscovery of the significance of the messages it implies for contemporary society. In this manner the research offers a different approach towards art, a prospect for widening its understanding, which, in turn, would allow examining its role and disclosing what it can contribute to the societal issues of the present-day world.","['Χώρα', 'Plato', 'Contemporary visual art', 'Ontology', 'Dynamics', 'Transformation', '‘Deconstructive’ Khôra', '‘Semiotic’ chôra']"

No Cult for Yudhiṣṭhira,"Babajee, Siegfried Jeremy","['Cuneo, Daniele']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Theology and Religious Studies (Master),Master thesis,en,"The Mahabharata, being a humungous epic narrative and a significant Hindu scripture, has been studied intensely by western academics for more than a century. The various characters, scenes and doctrines have been subject to academic scrutiny, all seeking to establish the multi-dimensional and even paradoxical aspects and teachings of the epic. However, while characters such as Arjuna, Karna and Draupadi have been focused on by academics and Hindus to look for heroism and epic and moral paragons, the most viable candidate for the moral exemplar, Yudhisthira, remains largely ignored by both academics and Hindus. He is the dharma-raja and the royal heir, he is placed at the pith of the epic narrative. He plays a central role in most of the ethical dilemmas which enforce the story. Yet despite these factors Yudhisthira does not enjoy the same popularity as other characters. This thesis looks into why this is the case. It establishes that Yudhisthira is an epic character through which the contradictory and significant philosophies which defined Epic, ancient Indian history, are explored. Being a didactic instrument in the narrative, Yudhisthira unifies, in confusing fashion, the multiple ideologies presented in the epic. Thus, in Yudhisthira, we find a significant aspec of the narrative which suggests a holistic reading of the entire Mahabharata, and suggests its cohesiveness despite apparent contradictions.","['Yudhiṣṭhira', 'Mahābhārata', 'dharma-rāja', 'dharma', 'pravṛtti', 'nivṛtti']"

Companies are engaging in developing interesting advertisements that are not only appealing but also convincing. Amul India, is one such company that markets its products very well. Amul is ranked as the number one dairy producing companies in India, but how does Amul maintain that position? It’s the unique nature of Amul’ advertisements that successfully stimulate the sales of the company. Amul started as just a dairy co-operative and now it is not only the biggest initiative in India but it is also getting national and International recognition. Amul is known for using its politically and socially crisp advertising. Correspondingly, a lot of its TV commercials touch upon the cultural and social values of India. Studying the uniqueness of ‘Amul India’ advertisements can prove to be of great importance in marketing. There are ample theories and techniques that teach the essentials of a good advertisement but studying what makes ‘Amul’ unique in its advertisements will give a chance to the other corporations to learn from it. More importantly, Amul’s understanding of Indian society and its use of that understanding to create very successful marketing can be used to gain knowledge on how to market in India successfully. Why Amul?: Amul India is the best-selling dairy co-operative in India has maintained its position for a long time. They have an intimate understanding of Indian culture, which allows them to be so successful.Most importantly it is one company that works for the people by the people unlike other companies whose main objective is to main profit and care a little about the welfare of the people.","['Social and political norms', 'Dairy co-operatives', 'Consumer Psychology', 'Media', 'Indian society', 'History of Diary in India', 'Billboards', 'Product Promotion', 'Bollywood', 'Advertising', 'Mother Dairy']"

The Impact of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident on the Opinions About the Nuclear Power Plants Among the Victims of Great East Japan Earthquake,"Zielinska, Olga","['Herber, Erik']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Great East Japan Earthquake and the following tsunami, which occurred on March 3rd, 2011, was a natural disaster of an unprecedented scale. One of its more severe aftermaths, the accident in Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, remains unresolved until this day. Thousands of people were relocated due to the nuclear contamination, and the local communities were severed. This paper addresses the discussion about the further exploitation of nuclear power in Japan, which arose as a consequence of the nuclear accident. Although the Japanese government intends to continue relying on atomic energy, various statistics have shown the citizens’ objection. In this qualitative study, the representatives of three areas within Tohoku region were asked about their opinions towards nuclear power plants, and their arguments. The interviews were analyzed through the premises of socio-psychological dual-process theory, which explains how the opinions are constructed. One’s personal experience, perception of benefit or loss, and the trust towards the government and the energy companies proved to be the crucial factors for opinions’ construction. Moreover, the tragedy contributed to end the indifference of citizens, disappointed with the centralized government and its poor disaster response. The importance of the local authorities is increasing, and the close-knit societies are recovering faster. Lastly, the Japanese urgent need for alternative energy sources became visible, however currently there is no substitute capable of replacing nuclear power completely.","['Dual-process Theory', '3/11 Disaster', 'Fukushima Daiichi', 'Studies on Opinions', 'Nuclear Energy in Japan']"

In order to do so, the methodological approach must be multidisciplinary. Quantitative analysis will be applied in order to understand the architectural development of the tombs. The prosopographic analysis will contribute to the identification of social relations and influences within the necropolis. Lastly, the landscape archaeology perspective will help us to understand the necropolis as an holistic element within ancient Egyptian beliefs. Understanding the necropolis as a whole, where all tombs shaped a large complex that ended up working as a sacred space, is necessary in order to give a semiotic meaning to landscape; a perspective not deeply studied yet. The symbolic complexity of Ancient Egyptians has been widely studied through its iconography or through its artistic elements but we have forgotten their own environment. Landscape is foremost a symbolic construction, a reference system where the different activities of a community acquire sense. Landscape is not a pre-existing reality, but a social and historically shaped one. This multidisciplinary approach will contribute to the understanding of the whole necropolis and also the role that Sheik Abd el-Qurna played in its development. Linking together the great material record of the funerary area with the symbolic thinking of Ancient Egyptian will create a wider insight into the Theban necropolis.","['tombs', 'thebes', 'New Kingdom', 'Location', 'landscape']"

Low translation quality in this documentation can have a detrimental effect on the quality perception of the brands by potential customers. This thesis examines the Automotive Customer Facing Literature, such as brochures, specification and price guides, and website texts, for the premium car brands Jaguar and Land Rover (JLR) and can be positioned within the fields of Terminology, Translation and Translation Quality Assessment. Since the involvement of the new communication agency Spark44, two years ago, the translation quality of ACFL texts has decreased due to mistranslations, incorrect language use and polluted translation memories and term bases. This is a serious problem that an increasing number of markets complain about. Therefore, this study has examined the translation process for JLR Nederland and provides a Translation Quality Assessment (TQA) utilizing the Multidoc adaptation of the SAE J2450 model, which was specially designed for assessing automotive translations. Based on the results from both the mathematical and observational TQA, the main problems have been identified and solution/advices for these problems have been presented. The aim of this thesis is to present solutions and advice to the involved companies to help them improve the translation quality of their target texts in the Netherlands and other European markets, and eventually all markets worldwide. This has been done in cooperation with the Dutch Product Manager and the in-house transcreator of Jaguar Land Rover Nederland (JLR NL), who, thanks to extensive translation reviews, is responsible for the high quality of the translated texts for the Dutch market, and the Product Manager of JLR NL. Therefore, this thesis will be presented to the Dutch Product manager of JLR NL, the in-house transcreator of JLR NL, Spark44, and the translation agency responsible for all the translations of Automotive Customer Facing Literature (above the line) for both brands.","['Translation', 'Car', 'Automotive', 'Translation problems']"

Hoofdstuk twee beschrijft de aanloop naar de beslissing tot een nieuw tramstelsel, hoofdstuk 3 behandelt de artikelen uit de periode waarin er definitief afscheid werd genomen van de paardentram. Het blijkt dat de overstap naar een nieuw tramstelsel in eerste instantie veel discussie met zich meebracht, maar dat uiteindelijk de noodzaak werd ingezien en de opvolger met enthousiasme werd ontvangen. Wel werden er voor de allerlaatste paardentrams in Nederland afscheidsceremonies georganiseerd, waarbij de tram uitgeleide werd gedaan naar de laatste rustplaats.

More than 15 years have passed since the 9/11 terror attacks, and yet success in suppressing terrorist activities and insurgencies still remains unclear. Successful counter-terrorism strategies in the wake of ISIS seem to require nations addressing extremism as the ideological motivation for terrorism. Reliance solely on the hard approach of war on terror seems to neglect the importance of the historical, cultural and ideological roots of terrorism. There is a pressing need now for countries to implement and include both “hard” and “soft” approaches in its counter-terrorism framework. Being the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country Indonesia has been an appealing target for ISIS in Southeast Asia. As a lynchpin in the region it has become absolutely critical for the country to handle the ISIS threat and reduce potential spillover in the region. While the Indonesian state has faced several challenges in countering the ISIS threat, it has also attained reasonable success in mitigating and containing the threat.","['Indonesia', 'Counter-Terrorism', 'ISIS']"

Gender ideology is the presumption that Western countries and institutions are imposing gender theory, which is the theoretical assumption that gender is a social construct. According to this presumption, Western countries are aiming to make structural changes regarding the positions of women and the LGBTQA community. The purpose of this study is to determine to what extend this claim can be hold by using a postcolonialism method, discourse analysis. The discourses of the representatives of Latin American countries were analyzed to see to what extent they are similar, and to see if they are comparable with Western countries. By looking at the Latin American region, this study tries to avoid methodological nationalism. The results of this study appear to not support the claim that Latin American countries are forced by external actors.

Word categorization in Mandarin: with special attention to its system of classifiers and measure words,"Tuijl, Annabella van","['Sybesma, R.P.E.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis I focus on the system of word categorization in Mandarin. The discussion on this topic is an ongoing one. I try to shed some light on categoriality in Mandarin by discussing several different views and contrasting proposals which have been put forward by different authors. In order to obtain some new insight I conducted two experiments, based on Borer’s (2003) theory about the exo-skeletal approach, in which I tested verbal coercion on nouns. The results of these experiments have led me to adopt the term ‘categorical fluidity’ (Kwong & Tsou, 2003) to describe word classes in Mandarin. This fluidity proved to be accommodated by the high potential for innovative ambiguities, which, in turn is caused by characteristics of Mandarin when it comes to morphology and syntax. I then take a sidetrack and focus on one word category in particular to point out a peculiar similarity. The results of a third experiment show that the flexibility that is found between different word classes in Mandarin, is also found within the word category of classifiers and measure words.","['Mandarin', 'word categorization', 'classifier', 'measure word', 'word class', 'exo-skeletal', 'categorical fluidity']"

Literatuuronderwijs na de kaalslag: visie en vernieuwing. Een toepassing van het begrip 'bewuste geletterdheid' in het schoolvak Nederlands.,"Vesters, M.","['Anrooij, W. van']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Nederlandse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Er wordt momenteel hard gewerkt aan vernieuwing van het schoolvak Nederlands, onder meer door de in de neerlandistische vakgemeenschap opgerichte Meesterschapsteams. Hun visie op het schoolvak is dat dit in het teken moet staan van 'bewuste geletterdheid'. In mijn onderzoek staat de vraag centraal hoe dit begrip vorm kan krijgen in een didactisch kader voor het literatuuronderwijs in de bovenbouw van havo en vwo. De uitwerking van deze vraag bestaat uit drie delen. Allereerst geef ik de belangrijkste maatschappelijke en wettelijke ontwikkelingen in het literatuuronderwijs sinds de Mammoetwet weer, evenals de realisering van het literatuuronderwijs in de hedendaagse lespraktijk. Dit levert inzicht op in een aantal bestaande problemen, zoals de huidige 'verkaveling' binnen het schoolvak waardoor literatuur een marginaal bestaan leidt (lijdt). Ten tweede geef ik een overzicht van aanbevelingen uit studies naar het literatuuronderwijs en de stand van het huidige onderzoek. Dit levert een aantal didactische aanbevelingen op die in vernieuwd literatuuronderwijs kunnen worden geïntegreerd. Als derde stap analyseer ik hoe het begrip 'bewuste geletterdheid' zoals gehanteerd door de Meesterschapsteams zich verhoudt tot verschillende opvattingen over geletterdheid. Ik beargumenteer dat een 'brede' opvatting van geletterdheid, als cognitieve vaardigheden in een cultureel domein - en dus niet een 'smalle' die vooral gericht is op taalvaardigheid - vruchtbaar is voor het literatuuronderwijs. De opvatting van literatuuronderwijs als onderwijs in cultureel zelfbewustzijn stelt mij in staat het te koppelen aan een model van Van Heusden (2010, 2012), waarmee aan literatuuronderwijs en de vaardigheden die erin worden getraind een basis kan worden gegeven die in de moderne cognitiewetenschap ligt. Tot slot test ik de toepasselijkheid van dit model voor cultuuronderwijs op literatuurhistorisch onderwijs, waarbij ik rekening houd met didactische aanbevelingen en leertheoretische principes. Het model lijkt inderdaad goed toepasbaar. Een toekomstige studie zou meer in detail de cognitieve vaardigheden kunnen onderzoeken die 'bewust' literatuuronderwijs (d.w.z. opgevat als onderwijs tot cultureel zelfbewustzijn) van leerlingen vraagt, om vervolgens het didactische kader verder te concretiseren.","['literatuuronderwijs', 'onderwijsvernieuwing', 'bewuste geletterdheid', 'cultuuronderwijs']"

"Frog, where are you? On the acquisition of ‘Motion events’ by second language learners of Portuguese","Alves da Silva, Iris","['Parafita Couto, Maria del Carmen']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Talmy’s (1985;2007) typology classifies languages into satellite-framed (S) languages, that express Manner of motion in the main verb and Path of motion in a satellite to the verb, and verb-framed (V) languages, that express Path of motion in the main verb and express Manner only when explicitly foregrounded for some reason. Given this background, how do late second learners of Portuguese, whose L1 (Dutch) is characterized as an S-language, lexicalize spontaneous dynamic Motion events in their L2, which is characterized as a V-language? In this study we investigate Slobin’s Thinking For Speaking (TFS) hypothesis (1996a), which states that the language we speak influences the way we are thinking during the mental processes of preparing content for speech and that restructuring these TFS patterns during second language acquisition may be difficult. As the L2 learners are acquiring a language that differs typologically from their L1, we investigate if they restructured their TFS patterns to those of the L2, or still use the TFS patterns of their L1. To do this, we look into the lexicalization patterns of Portuguese L2 (Dutch L1) learners and compare them to both Portuguese native speakers’ and Dutch native speakers’ performance. This study makes use of data gathered by the Leiden Learner Corpus (LLC) [http://hum.leiden.edu/lucl/llc], a collection of spoken and written data of Dutch learners of Romance languages. In total 42 participants were selected for this study: 11 native speakers of Dutch; 11 native speakers of Portuguese; and 20 second language learners of Portuguese. Participants’ linguistic patterns in encoding Motion events were examined by presenting them a selection of fifteen images taken from the picture book Frog where are you? (Mayer, 1969), which is regularly used in data elicitation for Motion event research. The participants were told to produce a narrative, describing as complete as possible what is happening with the boy, the dog and the frog in the pictures. The oral data was transcribed using the software Praat. The speech was divided into clauses. All the clauses that contained a spontaneous 6 dynamic Motion event, if the figure moves self-contained from one location to another (e.g. ‘The boy falls into the water’), were extracted. All verbs and modifiers were classified into the following motion categories: Manner verb (manner of motion); Path verb (direction or trajectory of motion); Manner+Path verb, (intermediate position between ‘pure’ Manner verbs and ‘pure’ Path verbs and has both a manner and a path component); Neutral verb (verb that expresses motion, but does not provide information about the manner or trajectory of motion). Native speakers of Dutch and Portuguese performed as I expected, with the Dutch speakers using more Manner verbs and the Portuguese showing a preference for Path verbs. L2 learners’ patterns of motion event lexicalization do not resemble those of either Dutch or Portuguese native speakers. This in-between pattern found in L2 learner’s production suggests two possible explanations: the first explanation builds on the theory of ‘Interlanguage’ as first proposed by Selinker in 1972 (Slabakova, 2016), which claims that the L2 system should be considered a system in its own right and not a defective copy of the target language. The second explanation builds on practical constraints of. This explanation builds on the fact that L2 learners did not possess the same amount of grammatical and lexical knowledge as the native speakers, and therefore they did not perform as native speakers of the target language.","['motion events', 'interlanguage', 'dutch', 'portuguese', 'thinking for speaking', 'second language acquisition', 'SLA']"

The European Union – A Strategic Donor? Linking Aid Channels and Foreign Aid,"Georgieva, Iskra","['Regilme, Salvador']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Foreign aid, inherently political in its nature and deeply embedded into the states’/organizations’ external relations, has been a subject of intensive analysis. The academic literature concerning foreign aid reveals that the topic of international assistance is a complex heterogeneous subject, since a number of factors directly or implicitly shape aid, these being institutional characteristics, domestic and international politics, as well as the role of public opinion. Moreover, International Relations scholars argue that aid policies differ tremendously depending on the channel through which the international assistance is disbursed. As a result, aid has been classified into bilateral, multilateral and multi-bi, where each of these channels has been associated with specific characteristics. In fact, on the basis of the donor’s trends in the employment of these channels, implications could be drawn about the overall foreign aid policies of traditional state donor. Yet, it is controversial whether the same approach could be used when considering other fund providers, such as international organizations, which feature peculiar arrangements. Especially intriguing is the case of the European Union, due to it being reputed as highly humanitarian international organization, which also contributes large volumes of aid. This research aims by expounding the trends in the Union’s employment of aid channels to explore the extent to which these are correlated to and indicative of its overall foreign aid approach.","['foreign aid', 'European Union', 'aid channels']"

De precaire balans tussen invloed en objectiviteit in de geëngageerde kunst,"Prinse, Marjolein","['Ruiter, Martine de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De maatschappij wordt gedomineerd door groeiende conflicten naar aanleiding van de vluchtelingenstroom, migratie en het botsen tussen culturen, religies en andere diversiteiten. Kunstenaars springen in op deze momenten van conflict om verschillen te duiden, te verklaren en mensen te verbinden. Deze kunst wordt ook geëngageerde kunst genoemd, doordat deze betrokkenheid balanceert op de grens van het maken van kunst en het helpen van mensen in de maatschappij. Een groot verschil met niet-geëngageerde kunst is dat deze geëngageerde kunstenaars met hun kunst niet enkel bepaalde situaties analyseren of bekritiseren, maar ook zelf de handen uit de mouwen steken om een poging doen om bijvoorbeeld politieke besluitvorming te beïnvloeden die verder gaat dan protest. Dit wringt, doordat de grens wat kunst is, die toch al heel precair was, nog vager lijkt te worden. Nadat ik op de filosofie van Hannah Arendt stuitte, merkte ik dat dit een interessant kader kan bieden om deze geëngageerde kunst te analyseren. Hannah Arendt bespreekt namelijk twee cruciale onderdelen in haar filosofie: Het politieke handelen en de rol die kunst heeft in dat politieke handelen. Ze stelt dat de kunstenaar die het werk maakt, geen directe invloed kan uitoefenen op het politieke handelen. Het werk wordt gemaakt, het object is af en zou aanleiding kunnen geven tot discussies. Maar of dit daadwerkelijk gebeurt, is buiten de macht van de kunstenaar. Als dit sec het geval is, dan zou dat betekenen dat de geëngageerde kunstenaar aan een onmogelijke taak is begonnen. Is de filosofie van Hannah Arendt nog toepasselijk? En zo ja, op welke manier is dat het geval, of zou dat kunnen zijn? Ik zal mij toespitsen op de video Episode III van Renzo Martens. Zijn werkwijze lijkt zich af te zetten tegen het engagement, maar poogt te spelen met verwachtingspatronen van de toeschouwer en deze juist te activeren. Hierdoor wordt de grens opgezocht wat ethisch acceptabel is en wordt de vraag gesteld wat de grenzen van de vrijheid van de kunstenaar behelst. Het medium video wordt sinds 1960/1970 gebruikt als kunstvorm en is daarmee relatief nieuw in vergelijking met traditionele kunstvormen. Daarnaast wordt vandaag de dag video veelal gebruikt (tv, internet) in de enorme mediastroom waarin informatie de mensen bereikt. Het werk van Martens balanceert op de grens van zijnde een documentaire of kunstwerk, ` waarmee hij de vraag stelt of zo’n afbakening nog relevant is. Wat ligt er nog binnen de macht van de geëngageerd kunstenaar en kan een kunstenaar zoals Renzo Martens invloed hebben of verandering teweegbrengen in een maatschappij die overspoeld is geraakt met media beelden?","['Art', 'engaged', 'collaborative', 'video', 'Renzo Martens']"

Gothic Drama on the Victorian Stage: Performing Dickens' Bleak House in 1853,"Korovsky Moura, Fernanda","['Newton, Michael']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Charles Dickens (1812-1870) is mainly known for his Victorian novels. However, Dickens pursued a lifelong relationship with the theatrical world. This thesis aims at exploring this relationship, taking into account two theatrical adaptations of Dickens’ novel ""Bleak House"" in 1853: James Elphinstone and Frederic Neale’s ""‘Bleak House’, a drama in two acts"", performed at the City of London Theatre in June 1853, and George Dibdin Pitt’s ""The Bleak House, or the Spectre of the Ghost Walk"", performed at the Royal Pavilion Theatre, also in June 1853, before the final instalments of the novel had been published. The main focus of this analysis is the investigation of Gothic motifs present in Dickens’ novel, and how they were represented in these two productions. The conclusion is that these Gothic elements were enhanced on stage by means of textual selections, set arrangements and plot focused on the Dedlocks’ Ghost legend, illustrating the sensationalist character of the nineteenth-century melodramatic theatre. Furthermore, the focus on spectacle also resulted in an impoverishment of the social criticism layer present in Dickens’ novel, demonstrating the productions’ focus on entertainment, in accordance with the theatres’ purposes and target audience in the East End area in London in the nineteenth century.","['Victorian theatre', 'Gothic drama', 'Charles Dickens', 'Bleak House', 'Theatre history']"

The field of song translation, and musical song translation in particular, has been underdeveloped and underresearched compared to other areas in translation. For this reason, the author decided to compare the translations of the original English songs, focusing on elements such as word count, grammar, humour, use of abstract vs concrete language, exaggeration and culture. This thesis first examines the research and studies done on the subject of song translation over the years. In a second stage, the lyrics from the original movie are compared to the Dutch and Italian translations, with special focus on the elements listed above. The results of the author’s research show that the Dutch translation is truer to the original English source text, whereas the Italian translation differs in areas such as concrete language, humour and word count. The author recommends further research on multiple other musicals, and the comparison between English, Dutch and Italian translation of the musical songs in particular, in order to be able to fully support this conclusion.","['Song Translation', 'Disney', 'Translation Studies']"

Cyber threats and cybercrime – a disruption of human security?,"Ossip, Silja-Madli","['Gawthorpe, Andrew J.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Cyberspace is everywhere in the world nowadays – all our activities are connected to the internet, devices are connected to each other and at least part of our life takes place online. Although it makes daily life easier and faster most of the time, sometimes people do not apply the level of protection in the online sphere, as they do offline. Crime takes place no matter the space, and the digital sphere has enabled a new world where crime is becoming even more common due to the easy access and anonymity. Cybercrime does not have geographical boundaries or time restrictions; instead, it is becoming easier to commit fraud online. Cyber awareness among people, such as knowledge about existing threats and their prevention in the online world is often considered the weakest link in the chain of committing a crime. Whether or not cybercrime has a direct threat on or even a connection to human security has not been discussed much. Human security in relation to cyberspace is shifting away from physical threats and towards psychological harm. This paper will search for the relationship between human security and cybersecurity through a deeper research on the subject of cyberspace and the threats that it poses to internet users. It will also analyse the level of awareness of potential cyber threats among internet users using the empirical data taken from an online survey of 220 participants and through the human security concept to explore the level of disruptions created by different threats.","['cybercrime', 'cyber threats', 'cyber hygiene', 'human security', 'cyber education', 'cyber crime']"

Hoy en día, los malls se han vuelto indispensables en la industria del comercio en Chile porque más del 25% de las ventas del retail se realiza en estos espacios, lo que no es sorprendente sabiendo que los malls más concurridos reciben cerca de cuatro millones de visitantes al mes. Mientras los promotores presentan los malls como espacios públicos de encuentro y sociabilización, varios académicos han criticado los malls por ser excluyentes y por lo tanto el objetivo central de la tesis es analizar el carácter de espacio público y privado del mall y su relación con la segregación en Santiago de Chile. La pregunta de investigación correspondiente al objetivo central de la tesis es entonces: ¿Qué relación hay entre los malls como espacio público y privado y la segregación en Santiago de Chile? La hipótesis correspondiente a la pregunta de investigación es que los malls contribuyen a la segregación en Santiago de Chile porque son tanto espacios públicos como espacios privados y lo último, junto a la ubicación y la oferta de los malls hace evidente la estructura de segregación en ellos.","['mall', 'santiago de chile', 'espacio público', 'espacio privado', 'segregación']"
The UPP program in Rio de Janeiro: The policy of pacification and its effects on citizenship of favela residents,"Gogar, Sharon","['Valdivia Rivera, Soledad']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2008, Brazil introduced a new public policy called the Unidade de Policía Pacificadora (UPP), specifically aimed at improving security within the favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro. The level of excessive violence in combination with the permanent presence of the police as a result of the programme sparked a lot of international attention. The UPP programme, however, also has a second objective after a specific level of security is achieved, which is to improve citizenship of the residents living within these areas. This study focuses on the latter objective in order to analyse the level of success of this programme in relation to the improvement of citizenship of the favela residents. Furthermore, the approach of the perspective of the state is used in the history and analysis, to focus on the role of the state in addressing complex issues in neglected areas. By understanding and explaining the difficult historical relations between the state and favelas and the residents, and by analysing previous initiatives aimed at inclusion and integration of the favelas and its residents, this study gives a brief overview of the history of the dualities in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The analysis of the UPP programme uses four main lenses through which the level of citizenship is analysed: a) recognition; b) inclusion; c) participation; and d) integration.","['Citizenship', 'Spatial inequality', 'Social integration']"

Further, how can coup-proofing impact civil war onset and leader survival? This thesis provides insight into elite rivalry, coup-proofing and leader survival in authoritarian regimes. I use a single case study of authoritarian leader Mohamed Siad Barre of Somalia, who ruled Somalia from 1969 to1991. With the use of existing theories on authoritarian leaders, I determine whether leaders use interstate conflict initiation as a coup-proofing strategy by examining the Ogaden War (1977-1978). I also ascertain whether coup-proofing can contribute to civil war onset and the removal of leaders from office. I propose that the Ogaden War was initiated as a coup-proofing strategy to reduce the coup risk of the Somali leader from the Somali National Army. Thus, I argue that interstate conflict initiation can be considered a form of coup-proofing. The study also suggests that protracted use of coup-proofing strategies, specifically, exclusion along ethic or tribal lines can deepen cleavages within already fractionalized societies, which in turn can lead to civil war onset.","['Somalia', 'authoritarian regimes', 'elite rivalry', 'coup-proofing', 'leader survival', 'interstate conflict', 'civil war onset']"

Attitudes towards Georgian and Floridian English,"Put, Ruben Baruch van de","['Horslund, Camilla S.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study focuses on the various attitudes towards Southern U.S. English; Georgian and Floridian English in particular. The research was executed through a questionnaire where the participants judged Georgian and Floridian speakers on their likability and their perceived intelligence on a 9-point Likert scale. These participants were 14 L2 speakers of English, who were first-year students of English Language and Culture at Leiden University. The questionnaire was divided into a section with audio fragments of the speakers asking questions and a section with audio fragments of the speakers speaking words.

"On the Moral Obligation to Obey Unjust Laws. Two Defenses, a Case Study, and Critique","Haerkens van den Brand, René","['Mokrosinska, D.M.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"The claim that democratic citizens are morally obligated to obey unjust laws has been defended by several political thinkers, among whom John Rawls and Thomas Christiano. In essence, both believe that citizens have to obey the law, even when it is unjust, that is to say, when citizens disagree with it, in a just democracy. As an example of an existing unjust law that would have to be obeyed on both Rawls’ and Christiano’s account, I discuss the Dutch law on euthanasia. My critique of their theories is that they do not take into account the distinction between laws addressing self-regarding and other-regarding conduct. It is my thesis, strengthened by John Stuart Mill’s harm principle, that every individual has a most basic and innate right to be the sole authority on her self-regarding conduct, and therefore that democratic authority is limited to citizens’ other-regarding conduct. Discussing in particular euthanasia in cases of a completed life ('voltooid leven'), I defend euthanasia as self-regarding conduct and therefore as a choice that everyone should be able to make freely. Rawls and Christiano are right to claim that democratic citizens have a moral obligation to obey unjust laws only insofar as they concern other-regarding conduct. To uphold the claim, they have to incorporate said right into their theories and protect it accordingly.","['Political obligation', 'Unjust laws', 'John Rawls', 'Thomas Christiano', 'John Stuart Mill', 'Democratic authority', 'Personal authority', 'Self-regarding conduct', 'Other-regarding conduct', ""Completed life ('voltooid leven')""]"
Integrated education and Irish language policy under the Good Friday Agreement,"Liakopoulos, Petros","['Milevski, Lukas']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Almost two decades after the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, opinions differ in terms of its effectiveness in fostering peace and reconciliation. Although the number of deaths linked to the conflict has sharply decreased since the signing of the agreement, a series of recent political developments have underlined some inadequacies within the current framework. Within academia, the two opposing schools of thought, namely consociationalism and integrationism, have been engaged in a debate regarding the empirical case of Northern Ireland and how it relates to current political science theory on conflict resolution in multi-ethnic states. This paper proposes an argument for a more nuanced theoretical approach to peacemaking by exploring two political issues that have been particularly problematic in Northern Ireland following the implementation of the Agreement. By analyzing the issues of integrated education and of the Irish language through the lens of both consociationalism and integrationism, I plan to further advance the theoretical debate in addition to providing relevant academic research applicable to the case of Northern Ireland. The inclusion of research and literature from a variety of disciplines allows for a more evidence driven approach to understanding the challenges facing the Northern Irish peace process today.","['Northern Ireland', 'Consociationalism', 'Power-sharing', 'Education', 'Linguistic policy']"

For this examination the three main reasons corporations give for collecting art are discussed; employee well-being, corporate image and corporate social responsibility. By using available research and interviews conducted with the case studies, it became evident, that if a company is serious about its art collection and would like to utilize it further than simply as mere wall decoration, it could be fruitful to employ an in-house curator with an art degree who can communicate with employees and other stakeholders about the art. By utilizing the art in a professional manner, it can have positive effect on employees moral and productivity, portray a positive corporate image and help to fulfill a corporation´s social responsibility by making their art collection (which often includes heritage artworks) available for the public and by contributing to the arts economy.","['corporate art collection', 'collection management', 'employee well-being', 'corporate image', 'corporate social responsibility']"

Gender Assignment in mixed Greek-English Determiner Phrases: insights from late bilingualism,"Goula, Eleni","['Parafita Couto, Maria Carmen']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The present study explores gender assignment strategies in mixed Greek-English determiner phrases, where the determiner comes from Greek, a language that bears grammatical gender and exhibits a three-way gender system (masculine, feminine and neuter) and the noun from English, a genderless language. We test late Greek-English bilinguals in both a production and a comprehension task. Previous studies on Spanish-English (Liceras, Fernández Fuertes, Susana Perales, Pérez-Tattam & Todd Spradlin 2008, Liceras, Fernández Fuertes & Klassen 2016) have shown that the analogical criterion (the translation equivalence) and the default gender play an essential role in gender assignment. The default is the gender that is the least marked and the most frequent in everyday speech (Poplack, Pousada & Sankoff 1982). In Greek, the neuter is the default gender since it has unmarked properties and it is encountered more often than the masculine and feminine gender (Tsimpli & Hulk 2013, Kavoukopoulos 1996, Stephany & Christofidou 2008). I designed a multitask study comprising (1) an elicitation task (director-matcher task), and (2) an alternative forced choice task. For the elicitation task, I tested 29 Greek people living both in Greece and in the Netherlands and having learned English in a classroom-based environment. The results show that the majority of the participants assign the default gender, which is the neuter in Greek when they are forced to produce mixed sentences indicating that they neutralize English words when they produce mixed Greek-English nominal constructions. In the alternative forced choice task, which is a comprehension task, the same participants of the production task as well as 11 Greek people living in the U.S.A. and in the U.K. took part. Those people living in English speaking countries were chosen to detect differences and similarities with those living in Greece and in the Netherlands. However, in the production task, it was not easy to gather data from people abroad and as a result, comparison and contrast were not implemented. They were divided into two groups; Group 1 consists of the participants of the production task and Group 2 includes Greek people living in English-speaking countries. Both groups behaved similarly choosing the translation equivalence in the mixed nominal constructions and the default gender in the pairs of sentences with the default and an incongruent gender. To sum up, both tasks produced different results; the production task reveals a preference for the default gender while in the comprehension task, participants pay more attention to translation equivalence indicating task effects on the participants. Production tasks are mostly spontaneous and can be seen as natural speech where participants do not process language as they do in comprehension tasks resulting in different outcomes. The combination of both tasks emphasizes the importance of gathering data from both naturalistic and experimental tasks.","['Code-Switching', 'Determiner Phrases', 'Elicitation Task', 'Alternative Forced Choice Task', ""Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgment"", 'Default Gender', 'Translation Equivalence']"

Het ontstaan van het vrouwelijk geslacht in de Indo-Europese talen,"Kuiper, Jelle","['Kloekhorst, Alwin']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Ondanks dat het vaststaat dat het Anatolisch binnen de Indo-Europese taalfamilie valt, zijn er belangrijke verschillen tussen het Anatolisch en de Kern-IE-talen. Een voorbeeld hiervan is een verschil in het aantal geslachten. Het Anatolisch heeft twee geslachten, commune en onzijdig, terwijl de klassieke Kern-IE-talen drie geslachten laten zien, mannelijk, vrouwelijk en onzijdig. Op basis van onder andere dit verschil zijn er taalwetenschappers die denken dat het Anatolisch eerder dan de andere taalfamilies is afgescheiden van het PIE. In deze zogenaamde Indo-Hittitische hypothese hebben de Kern-IE-talen gezamenlijke innovaties ondergaan. Eén van deze innovaties is het vrouwelijk geslacht. Het PIE had volgens deze hypothese dus geen vrouwelijk geslacht. De klassieke hypothese stelt daarentegen dat het Anatolisch tegelijkertijd met de andere taalfamilies is afgescheiden. Het PIE had wel een vrouwelijk geslacht. Dit geslacht is later weggevallen in het Anatolisch. Het verschil in geslacht dient binnen deze discussie een belangrijke rol, omdat geslacht binnen de morfologie valt en omdat het bij de Indo-Hittitische hypothese om een gezamenlijke innovatie gaat. Omdat geslacht zo belangrijk is binnen deze discussie, luidde mijn hoofdvraag als volgt: Is het ontbreken van het vrouwelijke geslacht in het Anatolisch terug te voeren op een Indo-Europees stadium of is het vrouwelijk geslacht oorspronkelijk en in het Anatolisch weggevallen? Om deze vraag te beantwoorden, heb ik de Agreement Hierarchy van Corbett (1979) toegepast op de vraag of het Anatolisch ooit een vrouwelijk geslacht zou kunnen hebben gehad. Deze hiërarchie laat zien welke onderdelen van een taal het meest gevoelig en welke onderdelen het minst gevoelig zijn voor geslachtsverlies. Nomina zijn niet opgenomen, omdat markering op nomina nog geen congruentie laat zien. Congruentie is essentieel voor het bestaan van een geslachtssysteem. In deze hiërarchie is het nominale geslacht het meest gevoelig voor geslachtsverlies en het pronominale geslacht minst gevoelig. Voor dit onderzoek is daarom het pronominale geslacht het belangrijkst. Immers, de onderdelen van een taal die het minst gevoelig zijn voor geslachtsverlies, laten het langst een oorspronkelijk geslacht zien. Vervolgens heb ik de Agreement Hierarchy toegepast op de situatie in het Anatolisch, beginnend met het nominale geslacht. Ondanks dat deze vorm van geslacht minder relevant is dan het pronominale geslacht, is deze vorm in de literatuur het meest besproken. Eventuele geslachtsmarkering op het nomen is irrelevant, omdat dit geen congruentie met andere delen van de zin laat zien. Bij de aanwijzende voornaamwoorden was geen spoor van het vrouwelijke geslacht te vinden. Bij de bijvoeglijke naamwoorden is de meeste discussie gevoerd. Starke (1982) stelde namelijk de relatie voor tussen het i-motionsuffix van het Anatolisch met het vrouwelijk markerende suffix *-ih2/-ieh2 van de Kern-IE-talen. Dit i-motionsuffix verschijnt verplicht in het Luwisch, Lycisch en Lydisch bij veel bijvoeglijke en zelfstandige naamwoorden in de nominativus en accusativus, maar alleen als ze in het commune geslacht staan. Oettinger (1987) liet vervolgens zien dat zowel het i-motionsuffix als *-ih2/-ieh2 de themavocaal vervangen en Melchert (1990) toonde daarna aan dat de distributie van deze suffixen tussen thematische en athematische stammen vrijwel overeenkomt. Ondanks deze argumenten, acht ik echter het scenario van Rieken heel waarschijnlijk. In dit scenario is het i-motionsuffix niet gerelateerd aan het vrouwelijke suffix *-ih2/-ieh2 in de Kern-IE-talen, maar is de beperkte distributie van het i-motionsuffix een gevolg van analogische processen binnen de i-adjectieven. Het paradigma dat volgde uit deze processen heeft zich vervolgens uitgebreid over de andere thematische adjectieven. Dit suffix kan dus niet als relict van het vrouwelijk geslacht worden beschouwd. Wat echter essentieel is, is dat het pronominale geslacht geen enkel spoor heeft van een vrouwelijk geslacht. In de talen van de wereld is dit juist de categorie, waarin relicten van geslachten te vinden zouden moeten zijn. Bij de persoonlijke pronomina is er beargumenteerd dat de mannelijke en vrouwelijke uitgangen fonologisch zijn samengevallen. Maar Lycische data laten zien dat de mannelijke en vrouwelijke uitgangen een andere vorm moeten hebben gehad in het Proto-Anatolisch. Vandaar dat ik de Indo-Hittitische hypothese aanhang en denk dat het PIE geen vrouwelijk geslacht bezat. Ik denk dat de Kern-IE-talen gezamenlijk het vrouwelijk geslacht ontwikkeld hebben.","['Anatolisch', 'Hittitisch', 'vrouwelijk geslacht', 'Agreement Hierarchy', 'Congruentie']"

Justification of suicide terrorism and the gendered interpretation. Case study: Al-Qaeda & ISIS,"Lee, Vivian","['Regilme, S.S.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Terrorism has been a controversial and focal point for discussion with many perspectives on the subject.The objective of this thesis is to present the justifications of suicide terrorism, focusing on Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Iraq with a comparative analysis. The gendered interpretation is also taken into account to present how this contradicts female participation in terrorism. The purpose of this thesis is to engage in terrorism studies from a different perspective and stress the inclusion of the role of women as this is often underestimated and hence used strategically by terrorist groups. In terms of justifications, this thesis investigates the strategic, social and individual logics set out by Pape (2005) in order to analyse the different reasons behind suicide terrorism and how terrorist organizations can justify their acts in relation to the broader goal. The gendered interpretation concept refers to the existence of masculine and feminine ideals that are connected to specific roles and activities in society. In this sense, prejudice based on gender is often the result and women’s capabilities to perform an attack are underestimated. The similarities and differences of Al-Qaeda and ISIS are teased out in terms of deployment of women and logics of suicide terrorism. The findings show that foreign presence in Iraq tend to drive both terrorist groups to their acts to free the territories. By connecting the Islamic ideology to the organizations, recruitment and support among the communities are facilitated. Individual motivations to participate in terrorism are mostly related to identity and religious attachments. By referring to terrorism as a masculine activity, women’s capabilities are underestimated based on their image and traditional feminine ideals. Hence, the dangers of a gendered interpretation are presented as this strategy can be used by terrorist organizations to conduct deadly attacks with many casualties by deploying women suicide bombers.","['suicide terrorism', 'gendered interpretation', 'al-qaeda', 'ISIS', 'terrorist groups', 'female participation']"

Met andere woorden, wordt Boëthius’ argumentatie beter door de 'Timaeus' in te zetten of had hij er goed aan gedaan een andere strategie te kiezen? Ik focus op de wijze waarop Boëthius de 'Timaeus' als bron heeft gebruikt om specifieke filosofische accenten te leggen en daar een agenda uit af te leiden. Echo’s van de 'Timaeus' vinden we bij Boëthius met name in de passage 3m9. Ik poog voor het voetlicht te brengen wat Boëthius met zijn 'Timaeus'-selectie in 'De consolatione philosophiae' aan het doen is. Om die selectie te verklaren, achterhaal ik het Plato-beeld in 'De consolatione philosophiae', beschrijf welke argumenten voor Boëthius belangrijk waren en redeneer, per via negativa, wat Boëthius zou missen in 'De consolatione philosophiae' als hij de 'Timaeus' niet zou gebruiken. Er is veel specialistisch onderzoek naar Boëthius verricht. Zo heeft Qi Wang in 2014 het belang van de basislogica en de wiskunde van Boëthius voor de filosofie onderzocht. Tot dusver heeft echter noch iemand in het algemeen de argumentatieve structuur achter de 'De consolatione philosophiae' onderzocht, noch de reden waarom Boëthius aan Plato’s 'Timaeus' refereert in het bijzonder. Dus, ik hoop een gat in de literatuur te vullen door een uitleg te geven van de argumentatieve rol van de 'Timaeus' in de Consolatio. Ik kom tot de conclusie dat het de combinatie is van, een, de kosmologie van Plato die tegen moreel relativisme en een doelloze kosmos ingaat, twee, de wiskunde van Pythagoras in de kosmologie van de 'Timaeus' waarvoor Boëthius sympathie had, drie, het veronderstelde primaat van de filosofie ten opzichte van de politiek, en vier, de epistemologie en de exegese van het begrip 'schepping' in de 'Timaeus' waarom Boëthius de 'Timaeus' in 'De consolatione philosophiae' aanhaalt.","['Boëthius', 'Pythagoras', 'Troostliteratuur', '3m9', 'Platoonse kosmologie en metafysica', 'Aristotelische ethiek en logica', 'Menippeaanse satire', 'Kosmodicee', ""'Timaeus'"", ""'De consolatione philosophiae'""]"

Comparing the respective contexts of British and Japanese sea monster art, it will show how similar circumstances produced art that, while very different in visual aesthetic, has a remarkable amount of features in common in terms of subject matter and context. Furthermore, it will examine the ways in which these monsters are depicted in visual art can tell us about how British and Japanese societies approached and dealt with the fear and anxiety surrounding issues such as loss of traditional social structures, political and economic instability and the rapid and unpredictable change this brought about.","['william blake', 'utagawa kuniyoshi', 'sea monster', 'leviathan', 'dragon', 'tenpo era', 'yokai', 'romantic period', 'ukiyo-e']"

Furthermore, the conduction of semi-structured interviews enabled the identification of attitudes and perceptions of the main Jewish Brazilian leaders towards Israel, as well as their role as members of a significant Jewish Diaspora. Central political issues that affect Israel, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, were also analysed by the leaders of the most prominent Jewish institutions. The relevance of the research lies in the fact that it touches upon issues of long-distance nationalism, collective identity and Diaspora politics from a standpoint that is not sufficiently explored by the contemporary academia.","['Brazil', 'Diaspora', 'Jews', 'Israel', 'Identity']"

It is the result of four months of fieldwork in Ruhija, Rubanda County, one of the four appointed areas in Uganda where gorilla tourism is established. This qualitative study aims at understanding how different stakeholders perceive the gorilla as an animal, whether that be a conservation goal or an economic income, or an anthropomorphized species. The analysis will develop by focusing on these three conceptual domains, namely, political, economic and anthropomorphised. Further, in order to understand how different stakeholders have different perceptions and attitudes, the research participants are divided into four groups. The stakeholders groups involve the local community, the entrepreneurs, the conservationists and the tourists. By doing so, the research will present the point of view of local, national and international actors. The main argument of the thesis revolves around the discourses about mountain gorillas. More specifically, how international actors have imposed western-centred discourses about wildlife conservation in order to ensure gorilla conservation. Along with national actors, who have later adopted the same discourses, to guarantee the development of the tourism industry.","['Mountain Gorillas', 'Wildlife Conservation', 'Uganda', 'Politics', 'Economy', 'Anthropomophization']"

Understanding the Protection Gap in Regional Migration Management Programs: A Case Study of the EU-Moroccan Partnership,"Yoo, Ye Na","['Milevski, Lukas']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The EU-Moroccan Mobility Partnership has been understood as EU’s migration policy to keep off unwanted migrants from reaching the Schengen area. EU is noted to have induced its southern neighbors’ cooperation by offering positive (or negative) conditionality. However, this paper claims that such an understanding remains Eurocentric and limited. The chronological development of the partnership demonstrates that Morocco complied with EU’s demands when deemed politically pragmatic, rather than based on the conditionality EU presented. Morocco implemented the partnership on border control to its advantage, politicizing the issue in accordance with the country’s geopolitical interests. On the other hand, Morocco was hesitant to institutionalize protection of migrants, including asylum seekers, in spite of EU’s growing commitment to the agenda. This paper claims that the emerging protection gap represents Morocco’s attempts to prevent EU from shifting an undue burden. By showing that Morocco acted with an autonomous agency, this paper shifts the scholarly attention from the North to the South and from positivist to constructivist understandings in accounting for international cooperation on migration challenges.","['Mobility Partnership', 'European Union', 'Morocco', 'migration management', 'protection gap']"

The first produced word from the utterances is analysed to give an answer of the research question: how to plan an utterance during online vs reading-aloud speech production? It turned out that at syntactic planning the phrase for both experiments is the preferred unit of planning. Speech onset latencies and initial F0 peaks form evidence for this planning process. Within the first phonological word of the utterances no main effect was found for onset latencies in the reading- aloud task, while this was found in the online speech production task. Furthermore, no main effect was found for the initial F0 peaks in the online speech production task, while this was found for the reading- aloud task.

Globalization of Japanese Art Galleries: An analysis of Tokyo’s contemporary art galleries’ art fair participation and artist nationalities,"Koppers, Roos","['Kharchenkova, Svetlana']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Although Japan started participating in the commercial international art world during its so-called ‘bubble period’ between 1986 and 1991, very few Japanese artists currently enjoy international art market visibility. Furthermore, Japan’s own art market and market actors remain understudied. This study aims to provide insight in Japan’s position in the international art world, focusing on contemporary art galleries, important gatekeepers of the art market. Through quantitative data analysis of Tokyo’s contemporary art galleries, this thesis identifies two factors to measure art galleries’ globalization: their ‘home bias’, which is the degree in which galleries represent artists from the country it is based in; and its participation in international art fairs. Although data for both factors show a relatively high national focus, Japan’s galleries’ home bias is especially large. Furthermore, Japan’s own art market stays underdeveloped and does not sufficiently succeed in attracting international art crowds.

Authoritarianism and War: An Attempt to Rationalise the Eritrean-Ethiopian Border Conflict of 1998 - 2000,"Holtland, Sari","['Bellucci, Stefano']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This International Studies Master Thesis adds to the existing explanations of the outbreak of the border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia, from 1998 till 2000. In order to do so, the thesis makes use of the insights derived from the theory of Chiozza and Goemans (2011). This theory takes on a starting position in which an (authoritarian) leader faces domestic opposition. Chiozza and Goemans argue that when, in such a situation, an ‘exogenous shock’ favours the position of the opposition, the leader might rationally choose to use international conflict to secure his/her position in office. Embedded in this framework, the thesis finds that the relationship between the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF) and the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) has been problematic from the start, in particular because the EPLF was not prepared to let go its superior status. Furthermore, during the 1990s the EPLF turned into an authoritarian regime, centred around Isaias himself. Despite the fact that official opposition within Eritrea was impossible due to the repressive measures, foreign opposition emerged, including the ethnic minority groups of the Red Sea Afar peoples and the Kunama peoples, which were both supported by the Ethiopian government. At the same time, the balance between the EPLF and TPLF was changing; the EPLF had to accept the TPLF as the ‘senior partner’ as they had become the leader of a more powerful country, Ethiopia. This also implied that the ethnic minority groups were supported by a more powerful actor, which could have been the ‘exogenous shock’ that favoured the opposition, mentioned by Chiozza and Goemans. Therefore, Isaias might have rationally chosen to initiate the border war as a means to regain his power.","['Border conflict', 'Ethiopia', 'Eritrea']"
The Revolutions of 1848 and notions of Britishness in the Mainstream and Radical Press,"Doklestic, Petar","['Evans, Robert']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the ways that ‘Britishness’ was engaged with in the British press during the revolutions of 1848 on the European continent. It investigates how both the reactions in the mainstream and radical press of Britain reflected their attitudes to and perception of ‘Britishness’. In addition ‘Britishness’ is considered as a concept still in development. The focus of this thesis has been The Times, The Illustrated London News, and The Northern Star between 22 February, which marked the outbreak of revolution in Paris, and 10 April, the date of the unsuccessful Chartist demonstration in London. The main body of this thesis has been divided up between the themes of Britishness as have been identified in the press, with consideration also given to the themes identified by the historiography. The sub-divisions are Order and Orderliness, which looks at how the press saw the revolutions, as well as the British people themselves, in terms of their capacity for maintaining order as well as being naturally ordered. The second theme is Reform and Revolution which investigates how the press relates these to Britishness, and the extent to which a distinction between the two was sought. The final theme is Exceptionalism and Exemplarism, which looks at to what extent Britain was seen as the exception and example to the rest of Europe. In all cases comparisons have been made between the mainstream and radical press. Overall the thesis has revealed that the radical and mainstream press had different, often contradictory and competing, views of Britishness, and used their own definition as a weapon against the other. The widespread and significant occurrences during 1848 presented a great opportunity for the development of a concept such as Britishness, and while the mainstream press increasingly saw 1848 as the other itself, the radical press appeared to try to combine Britishness with the revolutionary experience 1848.","['Britishness', 'Press', '1848']"
"Gender Roles in Jane Eyre, Dracula, and Middlemarch","Buijsman, Simone","['Liebregts, P.T.M.G.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis discusses Victorian gender roles in Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, George Eliot’s Middlemarch and Bram Stoker’s Dracula. The Victorian Era had strict ideas about gender roles, which can be seen in the literature from that time. Jane Eyre is the earliest novel that is discussed and it presents a complex view of masculinity and femininity. It might seem, at first glance, that the characters are mostly conforming to the gender roles, but it becomes clear that the lines between both genders are blurred. This is also the case in Middlemarch, where meddling wives and insecure husbands destroy their own marriages and happiness. This nuanced view of both male and female characters defies the rigid gender roles of the time. Dracula, on the other hand, is focussed on femininity rather than masculinity. Manliness is still important in the novel, but the main focus is on the transformation women undergo when they are turned into vampires. The perfect woman turns into an evil seductress when she is bitten by Dracula, and her misdeeds are harshly punished. This black and white view of femininity, or gender in general, is absent in the other novels.","['Jane Eyre', 'Dracula', 'Middlemarch', 'Gender', 'Victorian Literature', 'Masculinity', 'Femininity', 'Bram Stoker', 'Charlotte Brontë', 'George Eliot']"

GLOBALIZATION IS A CHOICE: UNDERSTANDING WHY JAPAN HAS SO FEW FOREIGNERS,"Kohnstamm, Natascha","['Pieke, F.N.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Japan is facing an aging society and a low birth rate, which turned out to be a dreadful combination. In order to “save Japan” from extinction and economical degradation, the Japanese government made effort in taking some measurements they saw as the best acceptable solutions. The most important of these included increasing the number of women, elderly, and even robots in the labor force to fill the labor shortages, while stimulating women to have more children at the same time. However, many scholars and other organizations such as the International Monetary Fund have criticized the Japanese government’s strategy stating that the only way to really save Japan is to increase the extremely low share of foreigners in Japan. One would think that this solution would not be too big a problem to implement, especially in such a highly globalized world. However, for Japan this turned out not to be the case. In order to understand why Japan as one of the biggest industrialized countries has so few foreigners even in a globalizing era, this thesis has looked at different factors that have influenced this outcome. This has clearly shown that Japan in fact chooses to remain ethnically and culturally homogeneous.","['JAPAN', 'IMMIGRATION', 'FOREIGNERS']"

The Abe Administration on Historical Remembrance and Constitutional Revision in Japan: A Poststructuralist Discourse Analysis,"Rocha Lopes, Marta","['Black, L.O.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyses political speeches by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during his second period of office from 2012 onwards, in order to uncover how he uses narratives of historical representations to reach his policy goals. In light of the opposition to constitutional revision as proposed by Abe, researching how he deals and tries to manipulate discourse in this field allows for a better understanding of the future trajectory of Japan’s foreign policy. This is because constitutional revision would allow for Japan to have a more active role in security issues. At the moment Japan’s security position is still constricted by historical narratives based on constructed memories or political myths. While the push for constitutional revision is not new, the recent missile threats from North Korea together with pressure from the international community seem to be speeding up the process. These constitutional constrictions are also heavily bound by the post war relationship between the United States and Japan. Furthermore, because of historical narratives, the Japanese national identity remains a problematic issue in Japanese politics. Thus, the Japanese government has to cater to both Japanese citizens and the international community in its official communications. An analysis of political speeches may help us understand possible changes or disputes on memory as a result of political interests. This is because official representations of the past are strongly linked with identity and thus also with foreign policy. Therefore, through the use of poststructuralist discourse analysis, this paper aims to research how Abe positions himself in the discourse of war memories and his actions to accomplish constitutional revision from his second term onwards. Additionally, due to the importance of apology issuance for the stabilisation of Japan’s relations with neighbouring countries, such as China and Korea, this paper will briefly analyse Abe’s apologies and utterances of remorse during his speeches through Lind’s framework of apologetic apologies.","['Shinzo Abe', 'Japan', 'Discourse Analysis', 'Constitutional Revision', 'Speech Analysis', 'Memory Studies', 'Apologies']"

Virtual Reality and Cultural Heritage,"McBride, Miriam","['Brood, Paul']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis was designed to investigate the the uses of Virtual Reality technology within cultural heritage. Using a postmodern analysis, this thesis is both a document study and case study that aims to inform, and help archivists and other cultural heritage specialists to contextualise themselves and their new digital environments. First, I establish why postmodernity is important to the archival profession by outlining its relevance to knowledge, technology, and the economy. I then describe Virtual Reality (VR) and the newly released and commercially available Head Mounted Display units (HMDs). This is followed by my case descriptions of Virtual Reality developers and developments, and a discussion of examples of VR’s current use in cultural heritage sites. I then move on to a discussion of archiving Virtual Reality. My thesis shows that Virtual Reality is no longer a promise, or something to work towards, but that it is presently here. The audio/visual illusion created by the currently available Virtual Reality hardware and software, has serious potential in the realm of cultural heritage learning. And this thesis argues towards an interdisciplinary method of creating cultural heritage content, with archivists, librarians, and museum curators teaming up with information technology and VR specialists to create, and store, their work.

"“Was auch immer käme, er würde nirgendwo ganz dazugehören. Das dritte Geschlecht!” Non-normative sexualities and gender identities in the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany","Littel, Nina","['Baar, Monika']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this thesis, I discuss the history of non-normative sexualities and gender identities in the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, during the period of 1945-1990. The main question of this thesis is ‘What are the similarities and differences between transsexual experiences in the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany during the period of 1945-1990, and how do these experiences fit within the broader gay and lesbian history of their respective countries?’ This is placed within the broader historical context of the German East-West divide. Studying the history of sexualities and gender identities that defy the cisgender heterosexual societal norm helps deconstruct the prevalent myth of a universal, timeless, natural, and self-evident heterosexuality. This heteronormativity obscures the experiences of everyone outside these restrictive boundaries, resulting in a distorted and limited body of knowledge. There has been a growing historiography on gay and lesbian movements within the German Democratic Republic and Federal Republic of Germany, but transsexual history has been severely neglected. This thesis takes gay and lesbian history as a natural starting point and then goes on to show how transsexual people fit within and compare to that history, based on transsexual (auto)biographical narratives. Whilst some problems were shared, transsexual people faced their own specific issues and treatment by the state and society. Furthermore, the (auto)biographical transsexual narratives are placed within the broader theoretical framework laid out by Sandy Stone and Dean Spade. Stone and Spade argue that the medical establishment created a narrative that transsexual people had to adhere to if they wanted to obtain medical treatment. This narrative was copied by transsexuals in a self-conscious strategy to obtain treatment, and thus many autobiographical narratives adhered to a set of very traditional gender-norms. The case-studies presented in this thesis follow in some ways the traditional transsexual narrative, but also often create a powerful counter-discourse. This thesis shows a more nuanced vision on the East-West binary divide, that goes beyond the prevalent opposing stereotypes about the republics. Often, the German Democratic Republic is perceived as controlling, moralistic, traditional, static and oppressive, and the Federal Republic of Germany is perceived as liberalizing, tolerant, modern, flexible and free. I argue that these perceived opposed tendencies actually coexisted and were intertwined, as reflected in the LGBT+ history of the republics. Despite the fact that the German Democratic Republic’s legal situation seemingly enabled a more progressive legal situation sooner than the Federal Republic of Germany, it cannot be argued that the German Democratic Republic was more progressive than the Federal Republic of Germany. In both countries, the sexual revolution of the 1960s was a heterosexual revolution, since social attitudes remained homophobic and discrimination persisted. For transsexual people, both societies imposed conservative gender-norms and supplied carefully restrictive provisions. The different political and societal circumstances of the republics created different realities for LGBT+ subjects, but these circumstances disrupt the perceived dichotomy between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.","['German Democratic Republic', 'Germany 1945-1990', 'Federal Republic of Germany', 'non-normative sexualities and gender identities', 'LGBT+', 'lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender history', 'transsexuality', 'Cold War', 'the German division', 'gay liberation movement']"

There is also no gainsaying the fact that he had countless ‘apprentices’ in late Qing China, and apparently many Chinese intellectual elites during that period thought so as well. In the field of literature, Émile, ou de l'éducation inspired Chinese intellectual circle, especially realms of literature and publication, and stirred up a trend of ‘novel of education’. In addition, Rousseau’s writings and his image frequently appeared in the new-styled prints in late Qing China. Yet if we make a general survey of Chinese history evolving towards the point of modernisation and afterwards, the course of history in China was essentially advancing forward in its own way. All in all, I will claim that the interpretation, misinterpretation and internalisation of Rousseau’s thoughts in China was a highly complex progress. The new community of modern intellectuals in late Qing China took and adapted what they needed from Rousseau without pursuing Rousseau’s original intention, and such tendency and the transformation of the men of knowledge themselves were underlain by both the macro framework of Chinese society and the internal development within Chinese society that had started several centuries before the Western impact.","['Rousseau', 'China', 'Late Qing', 'Modernisation', 'Literature', 'Intellectuals']"

Dit argument komt in de argumentatieve praktijk veelvuldig voor, vooral in het communicatieve domein van de politiek. Deze scriptie richt zich op de mogelijkheden en het gebruik van talige middelen in de presentatie van het argumentum ad populum. Hiertoe is zowel een theoretisch-analytisch als een corpusonderzoek naar de populistische variant van ad populum-argumentatie beschreven, dat uit drie onderdelen bestaat: (1) een theoretische afbakening van het argument, (2) een inventarisatie van talige presentatiemogelijkheden van het argument in de argumentatieve praktijk en een analyse van het strategisch potentieel van deze mogelijkheden, en (3) een corpusonderzoek naar de presentatie van het argumentum ad populum door Geert Wilders. Opvallende talige kenmerken waarmee een discussianten zijn ad populum-argumentatie strategisch kan presenteren zijn een perspectiverend werkwoord en de representaties van aantallen. In een corpusonderzoek is het gebruik van het argumentum ad populum door de populistische politicus Geert Wilders tijdens de Algemene Politieke Beschouwingen (APB) van 2004 tot en met 2016 geanalyseerd en ter vergelijking een corpus van bijdragen van de eveneens populistische politicus Henk Krol aan de APB van 2012 tot en met 2016. Uit een kwantitatieve analyse naar verschillende presentationele kenmerken komt naar voren dat de keuzes die Wilders significant vaker maakt dan Krol passen binnen een strategie die overeenkomt met de doelen van zijn populistische politieke stijl, waarbij het verwijzen naar en identificeren met de kiezer voorop staat. Deze keuzes die hij maakt in de presentatie van zijn argumentatie appelleren namelijk aan contextafhankelijke normen en conventies van een democratische rechtsstaat die ervoor zorgen ervoor dat politici een verantwoordelijkheid hebben om de inwoners van het land te vertegenwoordigen.","['argumentum ad populum', 'pragma-dialectiek', 'strategisch manoeuvreren', 'populisme', 'Geert Wilders', 'presentatie van argumentatie']"

Temporal Predicative Particles in Sanapaná and the Enlhet-Enenlhet Language Family (Paraguay). A Descriptive and Comparative Study.,"Gysel, Jens E. L. van","['Crevels, Mily']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This MA thesis provides the first description and discussion of three temporal predicative particles (aɬta, ɬke and hata) found in Sanapaná, an underdocumented and underdescribed Enlhet-Enenlhet language of the Paraguayan Chaco. Furthermore, it compares the form and function of these particles in Sanapaná to that of their cognates in the other Enlhet-Enenlhet languages: Angaité, Enxet, Enlhet, Guaná and Enenlhet. As such, this thesis has three main objectives. Firstly, it aims to be a contribution to the descriptive literature on an understudied indigenous language of South America, since it is based on primary data gathered during my own field work. Secondly, it hopes to provide insights into the genetic relations between the languages of the Enlhet-Enenlhet language family. Thirdly, this work hopes to provide data for possible areal or typological studies of the phenomena manifested by these particles: tense-aspectmodality systems, and (nonverbal) predication. It is argued that aɬta, when it follows a verb, functions as a prehodiernal past marker. When it follows a word from a different word class, it can locate the referent of a noun in the past (but is not a nominal tense marker), and it makes the inherent predicativity of this word explicit, just as Kalisch (2009) argues that these particles do in Enlhet. ɬke, secondly, is argued to be an immediate aspect marker when it follows a verb, and has the same predicative force when following a word from a different class. Furthermore, it can locate the previous mention of a referent or its previous presence in the extralinguistic context in the past. Lastly, hata functions as an indefinite future marker when combined with a verb, and also has this aforementioned predicative force. Based on these (admittedly limited) Sanapaná data and that of its sister languages, it seems that Unruh & Kalisch’ (2003) hypothesis of a Western and an Eastern branch of the family is warranted: Guaná, Sanapaná and Enenlhet cluster together, while Enlhet shares fewer features with these languages. Within the former group, Guaná and Sanapaná seem to be most similar.","['Descriptive linguistics', 'Comparative Linguistics', 'Enlhet-Enenlhet', 'Sanapaná', 'Nonverbal predication', 'Word class flexibility', 'TAM', 'Gran Chaco']"

Child murder narratives in Dutch newspapers (1930-2010),"Verspoor, Mark","['Burger, Peter']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"How do newspapers write about stories that are truly terrifying? Like the murder of children. This is the underlying thought that drives this thesis. An interest in the phenomena of child murder coverage in the press was sparked when Ximena Pieterse, a 15-year-old girl from The Netherlands got brutally robbed of her life in 2012. The headlines were full of powerful emotive language, the offender described as a “person without a conscience”. A question arose: had newspapers always written about child murder cases in this way? This thesis examines Dutch newspaper coverage of seven child murder cases over four decades; 1930s, 1960s, 1990s and 2010s. Employing a quantitative content analysis on a sample of just under 600 individual newspaper articles to answer the research question: what types of narratives are used by Dutch newspapers when reporting on child murder cases (1930-2010)? This study found that Dutch newspaper coverage of child murders was relatively similar in the 1930s, 1960s and 1990s. The vast majority (more than 70%) of articles written in these decades were composed of institutional narratives, this means that they focused mainly on the police investigation and subsequent trial. In the 2010s this changed. The percentage of articles with a societal narrative soared from 14% in the 1990s to 38% in the 2010s. Societal narratives focus on the response of the local community to the crimes, and concerns about the greater impact on society. While the percentage of articles with a personal narrative also increased from 9% to 19% in the respective decades. Articles with personal narratives focus on aspects such as the impact of the crime on the victim’s family, creating stories loaded with emotions.","['Child murder', 'Narratives', 'Dutch newspapers']"

Deze vraag beantwoorden we door middel van een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse. De vijf verschillende sportmedia zijn gevolgd op Snapchat. Op basis van de inhoud van deze snaps is gezocht naar de corresponderende websiteberichten, op de website van het betreffende sportmedium. Van de 385 matchende snaps en websiteberichten is een vergelijking gemaakt op basis van onderwerp, genre, nieuwswaarden, emotionaliteit en originaliteit. Resumerend kan gesteld worden dat de twee verschillende platforms van compleet andere aard zijn. De overeenkomsten qua genre, onderwerp en nieuwswaarden zijn ver te zoeken. Wat opviel was dat er op de website meer emotionaliteit wordt gebruikt in de nieuwsberichten dan op Snapchat. Het enige waarin Snapchat en de website niet verschillen is de originaliteit.

In an extraordinary fashion, these constructions merge typical North Korean socialist realism with African nationalism. The research question of this thesis is why the regimes of Namibia and Zimbabwe use the services of the North Korean firm Mansudae Overseas Projects to construct their National Heroes’ Acres. This phenomenon can be explained through the historical connections that existed between the southern African liberation movements and the DPRK, that have been fostered since the 1960s. The DPRK funded southern African liberation movements during their struggle for independence and thereby strengthened their ideas on post-colonial history writing. It will be argued that the Heroes’ Acres can be understood as potent symbols of nationalist history, used to legitimize the rule of the former liberation movements and inspired by the example that the DPRK has set for their African allies.","['Namibia', 'Zimbabwe', 'North Korea', 'DPRK', 'Political culture', 'Nationalism', 'Liberation movements', 'African Studies', 'History', 'Monuments']"

By analysing this bulk of literature and by comparing different writings from different periods, this thesis tries to move beyond the nationalist paradigm and focuses on the evolution from the hybdrid atmosphere of 'Ottoman Bulgaria' towards the outspoken sealed of identity of the 'ancient' ethnic-national category of the Bulgarians, so outspokenly supported by the current political order. The comparative and chronological analysis of the main Bulgarian nationalist sources, are supported by three theories concerning nationalism that are applicable in the Southeastern European context. These theories consist of the periodization-theory of Miroslav Hroch, the thoughts of Benedict Anderson who underlines the influence of the erosion of religion and the assumed political relevance of ethnicity as assumed by Azar Gat.","['Nationalism', 'Ottoman-empire', 'Balkans', 'Bulgaria', 'Ottoman Balkans', 'national identity']"
Challenging the ideas of 'Thainess' in contemporary art. On the construction and deconstruction of cultural identity.,"Taner, Sabiha","['Zijlmans, Kitty']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Recently, a change has been noticeable in the artworks of Thai artists. Appropriations from Japanese, European and American cultures have become more common and Thai artists seem to be more critical about their cultural identity. Thai cultural symbols and elements, as large standing Buddha's or characters from the Ramakien, are placed next to Disney figures and Batman, and artists are singing the Thai national anthem in other countries. Much is happening which has not been possible in the last decades. In this thesis an attempt was made to understand this current development. The Thai cultural identity, or the alleged 'Thainess', has been investigated and several possibilities of understanding Thainess were created. This concept is based on the effects of the nation-state, identity and the sense of belonging which all proved to be highly influential for Thai artists and their sense of Thainess. The contemporary artists Kata Sangkhae, Jirapat Tatsanasomboon and Rirkrit Tiravanija have shown that there are various ways to represent a sense of Thainess in artworks. However, not Thainess seemed to be the most important factor for Thai artists and the creation of their artworks, rather the individual positioning of the artists themselves. Cultural identities are fluid constructs and open to changes. The positioning and the context of the artist are most probably much more influential than their sense of Thainess. The three artists have therefore all different positions concerning Thainess and are also fundamentally different from each other, from critical to protective. But all three artists prove that the tension between the local and the global is something that they are aware of.","['Cultural Identity', 'Thainess', 'Appropriation', 'Thai art.']"
The promotion of civic identity through maps of Leiden: 1574-1700,"Jongh, Tim de","['Pollmann, Judith']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"In seventeenth century Holland, a fierce urban competition stimulated civic magistrates to commission works of art that increased their city's prestige.

Leiden's magistrate increased the city's prestige in the province by commissioning maps that reflected Leiden's urban identity and showed its importance in Holland between 1574 and 1700. Maps allowed urban magistrates to promote their cities to a larger audience compared to traditional works of art. Leiden's magistrate commissioned maps that reflected the importance of the relief of 1574 for the Dutch Revolt, the city's university, and its textile industry. By promoting these elements of Leiden's identity to a broad audience of elites and non-elites in the Dutch Republic and Europe, these maps increased Leiden's prestige in the political arena of Holland and secured the city's influence and power in the province.","['Urban identity', 'Civic reputation', 'Maps', 'Leiden', 'Promotion', '17th century']"

A thorough discussion and the positioning of these histories in the broader research agenda on Jadidism, has not been done yet. Besides the Turkish historiography, two more geographically located historiographical traditions exists; the Soviet and the Western. The Soviet discourse did not survive, whereas the Western underwent significant revisions in the new era. Based on comparisons in time of new Turkish histories and Cold War Turkish works, the changed perspectives from secular-nationalist to religious oriented, have been unfolded. In the comparisons between each other, the new Turkish histories either show the tendency of a traditional religious discourse nested in the Islamic scholastic scholarly domain, or an almost-secular reformist one that perceives the Jadid attempts as not bounded by the scholastic tradition. In result, neither the strong ideological framing of the Cold War does prevail anymore, nor can speak one of a thorough revision of the new histories; a ‘lighter’, de-ideologized construction of Cold War Jadidist narratives continues, by shedding light on the previously underlit religious aspects of the movement.","['European intellectuality', 'Tatar Jadidism', ""modernization of Imperial Russia's Muslims"", 'Turkish historiography of Jadidism']"

It studies the writings of Fanon on colonialism and post-colonial politics as well as the revolutionary ideology brought forward by Julius Malema and the Economic Freedom Fighters(EFF)in their political manifestos as well as Malema's speeches. This ideology has appropriated the works of Fanon to bring togehter the different ideological positions within the EFF. Fanon serves to bring together socialist as well as pan-Africanist and Black Conciousness crtitiques of the ANC's government of South AFrica since 1994. While these ideologies are historically at odds with one another, the appropriation of Fanon serves to bring a degree of coherence to a revolutionary ideology drawing on different ideologies and grassroots critiques of the ANC. While this makes the EFF's ideology seem incoherent or shallow it does allow the EFF to appeal to different sections of South Africa's population and to unify different political movements into one political party.","['Fanon, Frantz', 'Malema, Julius', 'Economic Freedom Fighters(EFF)', 'ideology', 'populism']"

'Geen hart kan kloppen in twee oorden tegelijk'. Hybriditeit in Paravion: 'othering' in een postmodern perspectief.,"Badwy, Sarah","['Dijk, Yra van']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Nederlandse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Paravion, a novel by the Dutch Moroccan writer Hafid Bouazza, was often linked to the Dutch public debate about the multicultural society in which Bouazza himself warned people for the dangers of Islam. With that in mind, people read Paravion as a novel about the ‘is-sues’ concerning the Moroccan and the Dutch people. However, this reducing reading dis-regards ambivalent elements in the novel itself and comes to a simplistic conclusion. In Paravion realistic elements are combined with obvious fantastic elements and ‘reality’ is presented in a specific way. More so, the artificial line between reality and fiction becomes blurred and often evaporates, which means that it is very complex to link the ‘novel-reality’ to our own reality, something that previous reading tended to do. In my research I analyzed ‘othering’ between the ‘Moreanen’ and ‘Paravionners’ with regard to perspective and focalization. I found that ‘othering’ becomes a hybrid process in which both the Moreaan and the Paravionner are Self and Other, depending on who focalizes or who narrates. I linked this ‘hybrid othering’ to the specific novel-reality in which reality and fiction are closely related. I argue that this hybrid ‘othering’ in which the difference between Self and Other becomes vague and ubearable has everything to do with a very important theme of the novel: the hybridization of the antithesis Self-Other. Another important question has to do with the value of representation in a postmodern novel where reality and fiction are intertwined and often impossible to separate. What is the value of certain representations when they are explicitly presented as fake? And what ‘good’ are ambivalent and contradicting representations that are not easy to link to our own (concept of) reality? Those questions come from the idea that representations, or even a whole novel, are only relevant when they can be related to the ‘real world’ and are in general mimetic. But even if representations are ambiguous and proposed as fake they are still inevitably tied to our reality. Not because they mimic that reality or attempt to recreate it, but because they ask us questions about our own concepts of reality and fiction.","['postmodernisme', ""'othering'"", 'postkolonialisme', 'representatie']"

The limits of boundaries: to which extent does the all subjected principle do justice to the personal autonomy of the agents under its scope?,"Appeldoorn, Maurits","['Fossen, Thomas']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"The all subjected principle aims to overcome the democratic boundary problem from within democratic theory. At the core of the principle lies the concept of personal autonomy. The principle contains an issue-specific demarcation strategy by which the demos will transcend community boundaries. In other words, a consequence of implementing the principle will be that the demos will be disconnected from the community. The objective of this thesis is to determine whether or to which extent the principle and its consequences do justice to the personal autonomy of the agents involved. This thesis will argue that, on the one hand, the principle has direct effects that seem to do justice to the personal autonomy of agents since it makes them co-author of the formal laws and policies within which their personal autonomy is embedded. Moreover, it provides them a de jure position to (co-)govern the social conditions of personal autonomy. In that sense, it promotes the self-governance of agents and, thus, their personal autonomy. On the other hand, the principle seems limited for the indirect effects of the disconnection of the demos from the community: firstly, it only makes agents co-author of the formal laws and policies and not of the informal rules of society. The informal rules of society, however, are affected by the formal laws and policies. Therefore, implementing the principle would open up the possibility of a situation in which an agent is not included into the demos because a particular law or policy does not potentially undermine her personal autonomy in the local sense, but will indirectly affect the informal rules of society within which the personal autonomy of agents in the global sense is embedded. Such a situation would not improve the extent to which an agent is capable of governing herself. And secondly, although the all subjected principle might provide agents a de jure social position by including them into the demos, this does not guarantee that these agents will also possess a de facto social position to (co-)govern the social conditions within which their personal autonomy is embedded. According to Oshana’s interpretation of the communitarian claim, such a de facto social position is a requirement of genuine self-government. As the principle is unclear to which extent it provides agents such a social position, in the sense that it only guarantees an inclusion into the demos, it remains unclear to which extent it does justice to the personal autonomy of the agents involved.",['all subjected principle abizadeh personal autonomy boundaries']

Shades of green: a comparative study of climate discourse in the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement,"Hisbaron, Nabila","['Shidiq, Rizal']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Earth’s natural systems have evolved over billions of years to support the life we live today. Yet, the Earth’s innate ability to sustain the ecosystem is taken for granted. This research addresses on arguably the most ubiquitous issue to penetrate all aspects of the human experience – climate change. The omnipresent nature of climate change presents the challenge of approaching the issue: where does one begin? The discursive history of climate change can reveal where the current position stands, and how it may proceed in the future. The transformations in the conceptualization of climate change, including its evolutionary discourse, reveals humankind’s normative relationship with the Earth. This research aims to explore the evolution of climate discourse on an international level through a qualitative discourse analysis. It compares two important landmarks in the climate regime: the Kyoto Protocol of 1998 and the Paris Agreements in 2015. Through a coding scheme based on three discourse strands—national climate security frame, international climate security frame, and human security frame—this research uncovers that there has been a significant increase in the prominence of human security frame and international climate security framing in the Paris Agreement since the Kyoto Protocol of 1998. This is due to the increased inclusivity of international cooperation and informed awareness of the pervasive impacts on human welfare. The findings of this study contribute towards the evermore relevant and urgent field of green diplomacy and its discursive practice in policies. It surfaces normative assumptions and ideas held by the international community towards the climate threat and their strategies to combat it.","['climate security', 'green diplomacy', 'Kyoto Protocol', 'Paris Agreement', 'discourse analysis']"

The right to leave and the right to enter: two sides of the same coin,"Jansen, Linde","['Meijers, Tim']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"It seems to have become a tendency to focus on the negative consequences of higher migration flows. More open borders would supposedly undermine the sovereignty of states and lead to an unfavorable lack of control over who enters the country and who does not. Yet I believe there are many good reasons to defend looser border controls and actually far fewer reasons to support strict immigration policies. The conviction with which almost every country in the world defends the right to leave a country, while they simultaneously resist to acknowledge a subsequent right to enter another country, is suprising to me. As Phillip Cole pointed out “one cannot consistently assert that there is a fundamental human right to emigration but no such right to immigration; the liberal asymmetry position is morally ethical, but also conceptually incoherent” (Cole, 2000, 46). Cole argues that in case of nation state, the right to exit one’s state is dependent upon entry elsewhere because there is no livable ‘space’ of statelessness (2011, 203-204).

Perceptions of Islam and Muslims by a Hindu Mystic A Systematic Study of Thanwardas Lilaram Vaswani’s (1879 – 1966) Thought on Islam and Muslims,"Sampat, Amit","['Jong, Ab de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Theology and Religious Studies (Master),Master thesis,en,"While there are academic scholars who have been studying the perceptions of Muslims about Hinduism and Hindus (Ernst, 2003; Engineer, 2007), there are no academic works which specifically deal with the perceptions of Hindu (mystical) scholars about Islam and Muslims. The purpose of this thesis is to introduce some Hindu scholars from the 19th and early 20th century, who have dealt with Islam and Muslims in their works. This thesis could be used as a framework to explore the Hindu perceptions of Islam and Muslims and therefore as an explanation for the complex relationship between Hindus and Muslims. The thesis will draw on the ideas of: Rammohun Roy (1772 – 1833), Dayananda Sarasvati (better known as Svami Dayananda, 1823/1824 – 1883), Vivekananda (1863 – 1902) and Thanwardas Lilaram Vaswani (better known as Sadhu Vaswani, 1879 – 1966) as sources of inspiration. Vaswani’s thought on Islam and Muslim will shed a new light on the relationship between Hindus and Muslims (for example when we take a look at his personal experiences with both religious communities in Sindh) in the late 19th and early 20th century. Furthermore, Vaswani must be seen as an ‘inclusivist’ Hindu (mystical) scholar who tried to unite Hindus and Muslims not only for a political purpose, but also on a spiritual level.","['Islam', 'Hinduism', 'Perceptions']"

Strengthening the digital Achilles heel of the European Union: Make use of ethical hackers to find vulnerabilities in information systems?,"Peeters, Gijs","['Oster, Jan']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Vulnerabilities in information systems have always been the Achilles heel of digital security. Ransomware-campaigns such as WannaCry and (Not)Petya highlighted the global and multidimensional nature of vulnerabilities and showed how substantial the impact of these could be for many aspects of the daily life. Vulnerability disclosure is a valuable instrument to report and solve these vulnerabilities to increase the security of information systems and prevent such events from happening. However, EU’s legal landscape for vulnerability disclosure is fragmented, and vulnerability researchers have to deal with legal uncertainty. Therefore, this thesis focuses on how the EU can increase the resilience of its cyber ecosystem through stimulating vulnerability disclosure. The purpose of this study will be to describe the different policy instruments the EU may use to stimulate coordinated vulnerability disclosure and prescribe which ones would be most valuable for increasing the EU’s cyber resilience. Coordinated vulnerability disclosure refers to the approach of disclosing vulnerabilities in the security of information systems in a controlled and responsible manner. This thesis will combine an analysis of primary and secondary sources – using technical and non-technical perspectives to bring these two worlds closer together to develop effective cybersecurity policies. To provide a deeper understanding of how the EU could construct a resilient cyber ecosystem: insight on cybersecurity, the resilience of ecosystems and security governance will be combined. Concluding, it is recommended that the EU uses a mix of regulatory instruments making optimal use of the expertise of the private sector to stimulate coordinated vulnerability disclosure. The outcomes are timely because in September 2017 a new EU Cyberstrategy will be presented.","['cyber resilience', 'cybersecurity', 'European Union', 'Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure', 'Responsible Disclosure', 'Ethical Hacking', 'Regulatory instruments', 'white hats']"

Origins of Supranationalism: Crisis and Democratisation in Southeast Asia,"Benschop, Anne Laurens","['Shidiq, Rizal Akhmad']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The increase of ASEAN tasks and functions has risen to a point where human rights have become enshrined in a regional commission. How can this be explained considering the history of straight up human right abstinence and abuses throughout the history of the member states. I hypothesise in this thesis that the recent democratisation of regimes of ASEAN member states caused supranationalism in the form of the creation of the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission for Human Rights. In order to consolidate the new democracy, regimes may pursuit locking them in into supranational institutions. This will prevent the democratic regime from falling back to authoritarian rule, since it’s citizens rights are protected by a higher authority, out of reach of the direct power of the regime. Results suggest this theory may hold validity in the ASEAN region where recently democratised states are more likely to support supranational institutions than the long term democracies or authoritarian states. This means change in direction and norms in ASEAN is the result of democratisation of member states that are using ASEAN as vehicle for domestic political goals.","['Liberal Intergouvernmentalism', 'Supranationalism', 'Democratisation', 'ASEAN', 'Indonesia', 'Human Rights']"

Republican ideal or war strategy? French support for an Irish rebellion in the 1790s,"Vrijer, Siri de","['Augusteijn, Joost']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Irish rebellion of 1798 is pivotal in Irish history. The ideas of the French Revolution contributed greatly to the development of Irish republicanism in the 1790s, when the United Irishmen began their struggle for an independent, republican Ireland. But the French also contributed in practical manner, by providing military aid in the form of two expeditions to Ireland in 1796 and 1798. This thesis analyses why the French Directory, the executive power during this period, decided to support the Irish, and if it fits within the framework of sister republics. The findings of the thesis suggest that the rhetoric the Directory used to justify the first expedition combined Republican ideals, such as liberating the Irish people from oppression and establishing a republican system of government, with war-strategic arguments such as using Ireland as a weapon to defeat France’s great enemy, England. However, the plan to use a guerrilla-warfare strategy, a chouannerie, in Ireland, with the aim to cause chaos and civil war, shows that Republican ideals were ultimately not the priority for the promoters of the Irish expedition, Carnot and Hoche. Before the second expedition, the political circumstances were very disadvantageous to the Irish cause, and the only way the French would help Ireland again was when they were to rise on their own. When this ultimately happened, the idea of an Irish revolution was enough to justify another expedition, and the Directory reached back to the rhetoric of the 1796 expedition. Moreover, the establishment of the Republic of Connacht shows that there was an attempt to establish a republican system, and the republican rhetoric was thus not uttered in vain. A successful invasion of Ireland might thus have led to an Irish sister-republic; however, the prominence of French interests in the event of an Irish revolution, the focus on English defeat and the chouannerie strategy show that the promotion of Republican ideals was not priority for the Directory.","['Ireland', 'France', 'French revolution', 'Irish rebellion', 'Theobald Wolfe Tone', 'republicanism', 'sister republic', 'French Directory']"

The thesis employs a qualitative discourse analysis method that researches online articles of news portals Tempo.co, Kompas, and The Jakarta Post. To understand discourse on the Chinese-Christian identity in its proper context, first is researched what the Chinese identity means within Indonesian society by taking a historical perspective. Secondly, this thesis explores the role of religion in modern Indonesian politics as well as the political and religious context of the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial elections. News articles linked to Ahok’s blasphemy case, demonstrations against Ahok, and the elections are selected for analysis. In total 42 articles have been analyzed. The results show that there is difference in writing styles between English and Indonesian language based online news portals. Whereas the Indonesian language based news portals remain neutral to Ahok’s identity as Christian-Chinese by not referring to it, the English language based The Jakarta Post creates a narrative in which Ahok is emphasized as part of a Christian-Chinese minority.","['Indonesia', 'chinese identity', 'media', 'stigmatization', 'discourse']"

"A Revolution Betrayed? The January 1919 Spartakist Uprising in Berlin seen from three perspectives: MSPD, USPD and Spartakusbund","Knoops, Michiel","['Dassen, Patrick']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis the author analyses the events between November 9th, 1918 and January 15th 1919 in Germany and Berlin in particular. This period is characterised by political instability. The socialist movement had fractured during the First World War over the support of the war effort. Radical socialists were further emboldened by the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The struggle between the three main factions of German socialism; the moderate MSPD, the independents of the USPD and the radical Spartakusbund, forms the core of this thesis. This thesis answers the question to what extent was the Spartacist Uprising a revolution to defend the November revolution or a counter revolution which would only damage the gains of the November revolution? By analysing primary sources such as newspapers, autobiographies and personal recollections the attitudes and opinions of these three parties the author traces the evolution these parties and their leaders underwent during the months November, December and January. Recent work by Mark Jones on the role of autosuggestion (self-generated beliefs allowing historical actors to truly and firmly believe that particular events were happening when they in fact were not) and the role and nature of revolutionary crowds provide additional perspectives how the main leaders of the three parties behaved during times of massive pressure.","['Spartakist Uprising', 'MSPD', 'USPD', 'Spartakusbund', 'Friedrich Ebert', 'Karl Liebknecht', 'Hugo Haase', '1919', 'Germany', 'Berlin']"

Disneyization in Shangri-La,"Baks, Maaike","['Landsberger, Stefan']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In 2001, the Chinese government officially recognized Zhongdian County in Yunnan Province as Shangri-La, which is a fictional concept that signifies paradise introduced by the British author James Hilton (1933). Ever since the region has been renamed, some visitors have started to express that Shangri-La County has transformed into a theme park and has lost its authenticity. The current essay explored, by using Bryman’s (2004) theory of Disneyization as a framework, whether it can be said that the name change into Shangri-La has changed the region into a theme park. The resources of this research were scholarly literature, travel blogs and TripAdvisor reviews about Shangri-La. Of the four principles mentioned in Disneyization, that all describe a trend common to a theme park, the principles of theming, hybrid consumption and merchandising were all found to be take place in the Shangri-La region. Only performative labor, as defined in the theory, was considerably less present in Shangri-La County. However, in regard to how Chinese theme parks (like Yunnan Ethnic Folk Village) function, such as the lack of smiling service, the principle of performative labor may still apply to Shangri-La. Thus, the result indicates that Shangri-La is comparable to a theme park and that how the theory of Disneyization is defined currently has no universal validity because it takes no cultural differences in account. Furthermore, in view of Jean Baudrillard’s (1994) account of postmodernism, Shangri-La is similar to a theme park in that they both create a hyper-reality in which a highly similar but ‘unreal’ reality is experienced by visitors through the processes of simulation or simulacrum. In this sense, the Shangri-La narrative has bestowed a frame by which tourists started to percept and experience the region’s authenticity. However, considering that Western tourists are predominantly the ones seeking authenticity in Shangri-La – may it be an authentic setting or an authentic self – it is their confrontation with the touristic environments like Dukezong that sways them to evaluate the region as a theme park. The voices of the local population and Chinese tourists were not brought into account in the current research; future research should therefore explore deeper how these groups’ experience the changes in Shangri-La County.","['Authenticity', 'China', 'Disneyization', 'Ethnicity', 'Shangri-La', 'Theme Park', 'Tourism']"

In June 2016 an answer was provided in the form of the European Global Strategy but is this the real answer for European collaboration in security? Is any real common EU strategy even possible without a common strategic culture that provides the context wherein policy choices are made? This thesis topic has relevance within the scientific debate around the possibility of an EU that serves as a security provider, particularly in the current era characterized by (home grown) terrorism, destabilized neighbouring regions and rising populism. This thesis researches the evaluation (if any) of a European strategic culture by the analysis of the main strategic EU documents, namely the European Security Strategy (ESS), the European Global Strategy (EUGS) and its related key policy documents. These documents lay out the plans for EU security and defence collaboration but do they incite the formation of a strategic culture? The presented strategic documents are researched and compared using document analysis on the basis of Biava, Herd and Drent’s provided Strategic Culture analytical framework. This document analysis will help to place the conducted expert interviews (n=9) that sketch the drafting process of the ESS and EUGS in perspective. These interviews are conducted with in particular Dutch experts in the field divided through two main branches: Policy Making (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence, EU) and Think Thank.","['EU', 'International Relations', 'Strategic Culture', 'Constructivism', 'Expert Interviews', 'EU Global Strategy', 'European Security Strategy']"

In brief, I researched the differences between the Netherlands and Japan. The political attitude towards the two different colonies might have been the biggest difference between the two colonisers. Therefore, I gave this subject the most attention during the writing of this thesis. I was curious about the different political policies that the Netherlands and Japan had regarding their language implementation in the colony. This thesis is a literature study that focuses on the available material of the two colonizers and their respective colonies. In brief, this thesis shows that Japan had a more direct and aggressive approach to colonization compared to the Netherlands. While the Netherlands mainly focused on becoming as rich as possible from the trade,the Japanese wanted to completely assimilate Korea.Several interesting differences were noticeable;one of those was Japan’s assimilation policy, which resulted in the uniform Kokuga language/culture. Conversely, the Dutch did not try their utmost to make Dutch the uniform language in Indonesia. Furthermore, the Japanese forbid the use of other languages apart from Japanese whereas the Dutch accepted the use of Malay, Portuguese and many other languages.","['Language policies', 'Indonesia', 'Korea', 'the Netherlands', 'Japan', 'Colonization']"

One country where this is especially true is China. This thesis therefore analyzed three different Chinese newspapers on their discourse regarding the US in the period between the latter part of the 2016 US elections and the first few months of Trump’s presidency. Special focus is paid to how the discourse of the newspapers relates to China. Generally, the newspapers treated the presidency of Trump, as well as his election, as symptoms of a greater US decline. Apart from US decline, there was also special emphasis in the newspapers on China’s importance as a great power. Overall, there was a big difference in reporting between the two state-owned newspapers and the one private-owned newspaper. These difference were mostly related to the focus of the articles and a relatively large shift in tone of the articles. The official newspapers changed their reporting on the US drastically in later reporting, as well as China’s relationship with the US. These changes betray a lack of coherent strategy in regards to China’s view of itself as a great power and its relationship with the US.","['Trump', 'Great Power', 'China', 'US', 'Media', 'Discourse Analysis', 'Soft Power']"

The Impact of Automation on Unemployment in China,"Mastenbroek, Lucas","['Wang, Enoch']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Human society is facing radical shifts of paradigm in all aspects of culture, politics, economics, and society in an age of exponential technological development. Ever since the first Industrial Revolution, innovations in production have resulted in the automation of many tasks initially performed by human labor. Especially China will face a large influx of unemployed citizens which can increase inequality and harm social stability, and sectoral shift of employment is unlikely to occur. This thesis will explore the scope of automation on a worldwide scale and narrow it down to the impact on technological unemployment in China. The thesis analyses the situation in Guangdong and Jiangsu in particular, because here there is a lot of employment in manufacturing threatened by automation. Furthermore, there will be an analysis of the government’s management of previous unemployment waves, inequality and social unrest. The social welfare system in China is currently ineffective to deal with future technological unemployment. For this reason, China should explore the implementation of a universal basic income (UBI) through experimentation. It is likely within the Chinese government’s financial capabilities, and similar wealth distribution projects have already enjoyed success around the world and in China. UBI has the potential to ensure the benefits of technology are distributed more equally to all of China’s citizens.","['Technological Unemployment', 'Sectoral Shift', 'Universal Basic Income']"

Shifting Politics in the Gulf: The Implications of Oil Depletion on the Saudi Social Contract,"Leijenhorst, Aron D.","['Ennis, Crystal A.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Oil-induced revenues that are directly accrued to states, or rents, are one of the foundations for many states in the Middle East, Africa, and elsewhere in the world. In exchange for political inactivity, these so-called rentier states redistribute a fraction of this oil wealth in the form of healthcare, education, salaries and other benefits. However, with oil gradually running out, the social contract that bases itself on this rentier principle is facing a potential end-scenario. In this thesis, I will be addressing this dilemma, by asking the following question: To what extent does a relationship exist between oil depletion and change in the rentier social contract? Focussing specifically on Saudi Arabia, I will deconstruct the Saudi social contract, and compare a quantified version of this contract with the process of oil depletion, in order to find whether such a relationship exists. The study will show that even though the exact form of this relationship remains subject to discussion, it clearly exists. In conclusion, this means that scholars should redirect their focus to the political implications of oil depletion.","['Oil Depletion', 'Political Economy', 'Social Contract', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Rentier State']"

Representation of Women in Zainichi Film: A Case Study of Blood and Bones(2004),"Mangoentaroeno, Winona Nikita Legijem","['Han, Namhee']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Zainichi community in Japan faced numerous difficulties in Japan due to their Korean ethnicity. However, the experience of Zainichi women is distinct from Zainichi men because of their subordinate position in a patriarchal social structure in their community as well as within Japan. The patriarchal structure in the Zainichi community is the main cause of the predicaments of Zainichi women, such as domestic violence and restrained self-determination. Further, melodrama is an appropriate genre to portray and create awareness on the predicaments of Zainichi women, as its element of tragedy focuses on human suffering to evoke pathos, an emotion of sadness, which is melodrama’s aim. By representing the social problems of Zainichi women, melodrama connects the domestic issues of Zainichi women with the larger social structure of patriarchy and sexism in the Zainichi community. However, melodrama film recreates situations where women are suffering and portrayed as victims, which contributes to their negative stereotypes. Moreover, melodrama’s constant focus on human suffering to emphasize the represented social problems reinforces the cause of the problems rather than criticize it. This thesis therefore aims to analyze the representation of women in film and the political role of melodrama in the representation of the predicaments Zainichi women in the Zainichi film Blood and Bones (2004). Furthermore, this thesis argues that melodrama’s element of tragedy in melodrama fails to criticize the subordinate position of women in the Zainichi community.","['Zainichi', 'Film', 'Women']"

It compares BVSC to a similar music project named ‘Black August Hip-Hip Collective (BAHHC), which was made during the same time and was also founded by an American. The main argument of this chapter is that the foreign perception of Cuba is incorrect and biased. The second chapter examines the internal view of Cuba. It studies and critically analyzes a Cuban music group named ‘La Charange Habanera’, who released an album in the same year as BVSC, and is quite famous within Cuba. This chapter will then compare La Charanga Habanera to both the BVSC and the BAHHC projects. The main argument of this chapter is that the internal view on Cuba differs largely than the foreign perception. The last chapter will compare all three music projects and albums and will attempt to investigate and understand the extent to which all three projects can be seen as ‘authentic’ Cuban music. It will argue that the BVSC is authentic, despite its Euro centrism, the BAHHC less so and La Charanga Habanera is most authentic. The conclusion will provide an answer to the research question and will provide a further discussion on the material that has been debated throughout the paper.","['Cuban Music', 'Authenticity', 'Buena Vista Social Club']"

In the last few years LGBT adolescents have found in YouTube a platform on which they can establish a virtual community and provide help such as sharing advice on how to overcome LGBT-phobia. The first chapter will provide an overview on the current stance of academia on the topic of how YouTube enables participatory culture and community building, with a special focus on the LGBT community. The second chapter will provide more background information on the problem of LGBT-phobia in Brazil. The third chapter analyzes four videos uploaded by Brazilian LGBT-themed channels and pays special attention on how the community is portrayed, and what kind of messages the YouTubers share. As bonds have been established among the virtual community, the YouTubers can spread encouraging messages that seek to empower the viewers to strive for more equality and acceptance in society.","['Youtube', 'Brazil', 'LGBT', 'Virtual Communities']"

“We Have Won the Battle for Linguistics”: The Role of Singlish as a Uniquely Singaporean Identity Marker,"Jagan, Julian","['Arps, Ben']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this thesis the author examines the attitudes of the Singaporean government and societal groupings towards Singlish. By assessing the change in the predominant themes explicated in the government’s stance towards Singlish, as well as the main themes present in the societal representation of Singlish amongst both the establishment leaning and non-establishment leaning sectors of society, the author attempts to ascertain whether Singaporean government policy regarding Singlish is at odds with the societal attitudes towards Singlish. Additionally, this thesis seeks to determine whether there is a divide within Singaporean society regarding Singlish. In order to do this the author uses thematic analysis of three main forms of sources, namely governmental speeches, letters to editor in the Straits Times online newspaper and user-generated content posted on YouTube. This thesis concludes that Singaporean government policy has changed regarding Singlish, becoming much less aggressive in its demotion of the dialect. The thesis also finds that there is a divide between the attitudes expressed in the traditional media and YouTube, with views on YouTube being decidedly more pro-Singlish in outlook. Indeed, this thesis also finds that young Singaporeans view Singlish as integral to identity construction and government attempts to demote the use of Singlish as misguided. These findings have implications more generally for the traditionally invasive style of governance adopted by the Singaporean government.","['Singlish', 'Language Policy', 'Identity', 'Media', 'User-generated Content', 'YouTube', 'Speak Good English Movement']"

Oil: Venezuela's Sticky Language of Corruption?,"Tenkink, Tirza","['Solheim, H.A.S.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Venezuela has one of the largest oil resource in the world and the oil sector is one of the most prone sectors to corruption. As the Corruption Perception Index shows is the level of corruption in Venezuela also one of the highest of Latin America. In this thesis the level of influence of corruption on the resource curse will be assessed, specifically looking at the case study of Venezuela during the Bolivarian Revolution of Hugo Chávez. First, a theoretical framework is created in order to understand the relation between corruption and the resource curse. Second, a contextualization is provided through analyzing the Punto Fijo Pact which preceded the Hugo Chávez government. In this chapter increasing dissatisfaction of the Venezuelan population is shown, which together with the Caracazo massacre, created a platform for Hugo Chávez to gain power and popularity. In the third chapter, the theoretical framework will be applied to Chávez’s Venezuela and its consequences. Whereas the theoretical framework suggests that the resource curse is strengthened by corruption and thus will prevent a country with an abundant resource from developing, the case of Venezuela appears to be have proved the contrary. After analyzing the resource curse in Venezuela it shows that even though an abundant resource is present and corruption is still increasing, the oil revenues have allowed Hugo Chávez to fund several new socioeconomic programs which largely have benefitted the Venezuelan development.","['Oil', 'Resource Curse', 'Venezuela', 'Corruption', 'Hugo Chávez', 'Neoliberalism', 'Political corruption']"

象は鼻が長い　An analysis of wa and ga in L2 Japanese speakers’ written production,"Baque', Giulia","['Yoshioka, Keiko']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In recent years, the number of people, both students and adults, learning Japanese has been on the rise throughout the world. With such a fast development, problems and issues concerning both the acquisition of the Japanese language and the teaching method used have become evident. In particular one of the most challenging features of the language has noticeably been detected in the two particles wa and ga. Those two particles, having mainly the function of theme and subject markers, represent an intriguing point for scholars and students alike. Their uses have been at the center of analysis for many years and many linguists have devoted a huge part of their research to inspect their most debated aspects. Researches have focused on different functions each particle can assume and, how their usages can influence the general meaning of a sentence. From Kuno‟s The structure of the Japanese language, considered to be the cornerstone in the field, many different angles of analysis have been used to describe these two particles. Wa and ga are an interesting point of analysis inasmuch as their distinction is vague and subtle both for learners and for Japanese native speakers. Hence, with my research I would like to analyze this issue more in depth, producing evidences of a link between teaching method and particles errors. Through the analysis of written production by L2 Japanese learners, this research confirmed previous findings. It demonstrated a link between classroom instruction and errors in particles usage, calling for much needed reform in Japanese second language teaching.","['Japanese', 'linguistics', 'SLA']"

"Voor Vlaanderen, voor Vlamingen, enkel in het Vlaams Belang. Een taalkundig-stilistisch onderzoek naar populistisch taalgebruik in het Vlaams Parlement","Mes, Jolijn","['Leeuwen, Maarten van']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"‘Populisme’ is een term die vaak wordt gehoord, maar waarvan niet helemaal duidelijk is wat het precies is. Er is een visie die zegt dat populisme gezien kan worden als een communicatiestijl, maar in de wetenschap blijft dit concept vaak wat impressionistisch: de indrukken zijn globaal gekarakteriseerd en de suggestie dat populisme een politieke communicatiestijl is die door middel van bepaalde kenmerken tot uitdrukking komt in taal, blijft dan ook niet meer dan dat: een suggestie. Om erachter te komen wat het taalgebruik van populisten precies kenmerkt, is in deze scriptie taalkundig-stilistisch onderzoek gedaan naar een specifieke casus. Taalkundig-stilistisch onderzoek is gebaseerd op de idee dat stilistische keuzes van een taalgebruiker invloed kunnen hebben op de globale indruk die wordt gewekt. De indruk van een populistische communicatiestijl zou dus kunnen worden gewekt door bepaalde keuzes die worden gemaakt in het taalgebruik. Als er zoiets als een ‘populistische stijl’ zou bestaan, is het dus aannemelijk dat deze stilistische keuzes aan te wijzen zijn in het taalgebruik van verschillende mensen die de indruk van populisme wekken, en dat ze niet of minder aan te wijzen zijn in het taalgebruik van niet-populistische mensen. Op basis van politicologische literatuur is eerst bepaald uit welke kenmerken populisme bestaat. Het centrale thema van populisme bleek de relatie tussen ‘het volk’ en ‘de elite’ te zijn, waarbij ‘volksverheerlijking’ tegenover ‘anti-elitisme’ staat. Aan deze kernkenmerken zijn de uit de literatuur gedestilleerde overige kenmerken van populisme gekoppeld: de kiezers centraal stellen, een volkse stijl, een ‘wij versus zij’-gevoel, gevoelens van crisis of dreiging en slechte manieren. Deze kenmerken zijn vervolgens met behulp van taalkundig-stilistische literatuur over populistische politici gekoppeld aan stilistische keuzes op microniveau, wat resulteerde in een lijst van 27 bruikbare stijlmiddelen. Deze stijlmiddelen zijn geanalyseerd in een case waarbij het taalgebruik van twee niet-populistische Vlaamse politici (Sven Gatz (Open VLD) en Joris Vandenbroucke (sp.a)) met twee populistische Vlaamse politici (Filip Dewinter (VB) en Chris Janssens (VB)) zijn vergeleken. De verwachting was daarbij dat de communicatiestijl van Gatz en Vandenbroucke aan de ene kant significant zou verschillen van die van respectievelijk Dewinter en Janssens aan de andere kant, op basis van de 27 stijlmiddelen die gekoppeld konden worden aan de kenmerken waar een populistische communicatiestijl uit bestaat. Uit de resultaten bleek dat van drie stilistische middelen gezegd kon worden dat zowel Dewinter als Janssens ze significant vaker gebruikten in hun teksten dan respectievelijk Gatz en Vandenbroucke: het aantal geciteerde woorden lag bij de populistische politici hoger, net als het aantal concrete naamwoorden en het aantal intensiveerders. Daarnaast maakte Dewinter vaker gebruik dan Gatz van citaten en categorie C-metaforen en juist minder van potentieel problematische verwijswoorden en een inclusief ‘wij’ waarmee politici werden bedoeld. Janssens maakt naast het aantal geciteerde woorden, het aantal concrete naamwoorden en het aantal intensiveerders ook vaker dan Vandenbroucke gebruik van verwijzingen naar kiezers in de subjectspositie in combinatie met een perspectiverend werkwoord, een inclusief ‘wij’ waarmee politici werden bedoeld en categorie-A metaforen. Aangezien binnen de visie dat populisme een communicatiestijl is wordt aangenomen dat deze communicatiestijl een gradueel verschijnsel is, kan uit de resultaten geconcludeerd worden dat, met betrekking tot de hierboven genoemde stilistische middelen, Dewinter een volksere stijl hanteert, meer een wij-tegen-zij-gevoel oproept en vaker een gevoel van crisis oproept dan Gatz. Over Janssens kan gezegd worden dat hij met betrekking tot de hierboven genoemde stijlmiddelen de kiezers meer centraal stelt, een volksere stijl hanteert en vaker een gevoel van crisis opwekt dan Vandenbroucke. Het lijkt er dus op dat door de populistische politici inderdaad meer gebruik wordt gemaakt van een populistische communicatiestijl, hoewel dit in mindere mate is dan aanvankelijk werd verwacht.","['Populisme', 'Taalbeheersing', 'Taalkundig-stilistisch onderzoek', 'Vlaanderen', 'Politiek']"

Chinese classifier categorizations and the application to second language acquisition,"Huang, Wenyu","['Sybesma, Rint']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Mandarin Chinese is usually considered a numeral classifier language (Del Gobbo, 2014). According to Allan’s (1977) definition, a numeral classifier is an independent morpheme that “denotes some salient perceived or imputed characteristic of the entity to which the associated noun refers” (p. 285). The present study first constructs a categorization of Chinese classifiers, and second, an investigation in the acquisition of Chinese Classifiers for L2 learners. To construct the categorization of Chinese classifiers, I will first provide an overview of the categorizations of Chinese classifiers from previous studies and discuss the primary features of the categorizations provided by Chinese and Western scholars. In general, there is no distinction between measure words and classifiers in the categorizations given by Chinese scholars, while most of the Western categorizations do make the distinction. However, the classifiers that are discussed by Western scholars only represent part of a large system of Chinese classifiers. Based on current categorizations, a revised categorization focusing on Chinese classifiers is carried out. The second part is to explore the acquisition of Chinese Classifiers for L2 learners with the goal of providing some suggestions on teaching and learning Chinese Classifiers that potentially benefits both L2 learners and teachers. First, I will illustrate previous studies of Chinese CLs acquisition for L2 learners in which the difficulties in learning Chinese CLs for L2 learners will also be displayed. Secondly, I will discuss current teaching materials and methods of Chinese CLs. Finally, the revised categorization will be applied in order to propose a more effective approach in teaching and learning Chinese classifiers before the conclusion is addressed.","['Chinese classifier', 'second language acquisition']"
"Access to information on sexual reproductive health amongst young women in Mara region, Tanzania","Pirvu, Anastasia","['Both, Jonna']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"High prevalence of HIV, teenage pregnancy and unsafe abortions are challenges faced by many countries in the Global South. Research shows that much of the health problems that arise are due to a lack of general basic understanding on reproductive biology. However engaging in open discussions on sexual and reproductive health is not always fruitful due to social and cultural barriers. Using the theory of empowerment, the thesis looks into the relation between ICT, youth and public health in Mara region, Tanzania. Research findings point to a growing usage of ICT within the region, however mostly limited to radio and mobile phones. Efforts in Tanzania to improve information access on public health are visible, although they are more often than not handled as individual cases rather than collective attempts to work towards a long-term goal. A strong centralised system that allocates sufficient funds and resources for further developing sexual and reproductive health matters is therefore required along with research to assess the effectiveness of the changes implemented.","['ICT', 'Public Health', 'Empowerment', 'Tanzania', 'Youth']"
Reduplication in Serudung Murut,"Townsend, Joel","['Audring, Jenny']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The thesis concerns Serudung Murut, a language of the Southwest Sabah subgroup of the Austronesian language family. Outside of a wordlist in Lobel (2016), virtually no published material on Serudung Murut exists. Data for this thesis comes from three main sources: two corpuses of language material collected in the periods of 1988-1991 and 2013-2016 by SIL researcher Jack Rushing, and one corpus of language material collected by the author for the author's Fieldwork (Internship) module in the period of January 16 to February 17, 2017. The bulk of language material comes from the variety of Serudung Murut spoken in the village of Serudung Laut in the western-most corner of Tawau Division, Sabah, Malaysia. Serudung Murut displays full lexical reduplication (mugad ""travel"" > mugad-mugad ""wander about""), full root reduplication (gadingan ""elephant"" > gading-gadingan ""lots of elephants""), and partial reduplication (bariu ""wind"" > babariu ""windy""). Reduplication may occur with a stem from any word class, and may either alter the word class or the semantics of the stem, or both. Sometimes, a word which displays reduplication is amorphous, as with certain animal names and body parts: kakapir ""praying mantis"", sisigon ""stingless bee"", susuap ""kneecap"", bibingo ""ankle"". The thesis frames an analysis of reduplication in Serudung Murut according to a recent model devised by Jackendoff & Audring (to appear), called Relational Morphology. Relational Morphology is an offshoot of the Parallel Architecture (Jackendoff, 2002), a linguistic model which proposes that Phonology, Semantics and Syntax are independent linguistic components and are active simultaneously in speech production and parsing. Relational Morphology generalizes patterns between words in a lexicon and represents them as schemas. Therefore, a description of Serudung Murut reduplication according to this framework must posit generalized schemas which capture not only the structural variation, between full and partial reduplication, but also the variation in semantic effects.","['austronesian', 'sabah', 'reduplication', 'parallel architecture', 'relational morphology', 'murut', 'borneo']"

First, the aim of this thesis is to ascertain the perceived effectiveness of the 2015 Tanzanian Witchdoctor Ban as a countermeasure to the violence being perpetrated against people with albinism from the standpoint of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Tanzanian Government, and various NGOs actively engaged in the welfare of people with albinism in the region. The second chapter illustrates the state of the art of the literature concerning the Tanzanian societal witchcraft paradigm, status of PWA in traditional culture, occult-legislation, and indicators of legislative efficacy. The third chapter explains the multi-indicator document analysis conducted to determine each actor’s perception of the ban’s efficacy. The fourth chapter relays the results of the analysis, where it was determined that the United Nations Human Rights Council held a neutral perception of the effectiveness of the Witchdoctor Ban, the Tanzanian Government held a positive perception, and the various NGOs held a negative perception. This thesis henceforth concludes with a critical examination of the results and methodology, and a conclusory statement that further research into efficacy indicators and occult-legislation as an institutional countermeasure towards the violence against people with albinism can be facilitated by the foundation built through this research and its accompanied findings.","['albinism', 'occult', 'Africa', 'Tanzania', 'legislation', 'efficacy']"

Uruguay's Low Corruption Levels: A Search For Explanations,"El Bakioui, Omar","['Silva, P.', 'Rios Oyola, S.M.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Uruguay‘s favourable position on the Corruption Index is one which has baffled many scholars in the region. While many attempt to explain Uruguay‘s success by looking at specific policies and programmes that have been implemented in the last two decades, this paper attempts to explain the low corruption levels by analysing the shift in the Uruguayan political structure. The long drawn out transformation, from a state riddled with clientelistic-networks towards a programmatic political spectrum, illustrates that the country has improved its levels of universalism and that the manner parties compete for votes has drastically changed. This paper argues that the shift towards programmatic politics is due to a number of events that took place after the Military Authoritarian-Regime. The dissatisfaction with the traditional parties, after the fall of the authoritarian state, allowed for the left-wing parties to surge. The increase in electoral strength of the left meant the introduction of a third actor within the political realm. This new actor broke the equilibrium of co-participation that the traditional parties had been experiencing for a prolonged time. The disruption of this equilibrium meant that the traditional parties now had to change the manner for competing for votes, from a clientelistic and particularistic manner towards a programmatic and universalistic approach. Nevertheless, institutional reforms together with the decentralization of power ensued in the 1990s further reducing corruption levels. We come to the conclusion that in order to grasp the success of Uruguay concerning its corruption levels, one has to look at the broader political shift, as the policy and programmes that have been implemented in the last two decades are nothing but a bi-product of said transformation.","['corruption', 'clientelism', 'particularism', 'programmatic politics', 'Open Access Order', 'Universalism', 'co-participation']"

"Contraventions of the labor rights of Indonesian undocumented migrant workers in The Netherlands: Policies, Safeguards and Access to Justice","Atfin, Hafizh","['Oster, Jan']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The relationship between the Netherlands’ state policy and migrants in an irregular situation is mediated by international and EU conventions, agreements and Directives. This study will suggest that victims’ protection safeguards are not fully in place, especially for undocumented migrants. This research provides an overview of the provisions for the protection of the basic human rights of undocumented migrants in particular, as the most vulnerable group of migrants. The study suggests that the effectiveness of legal protection provisions depends on how these provisions are formulated and also on their practical application in specific cases. Recognition of undocumented people’s rights includes the important issue, which is focused on in this study, of the undocumented as victims of criminal forms of labor exploitation. Therefore this research focuses on the implementation of these safeguards through the study of three cases of three undocumented Indonesian migrants in the Netherlands in attaining their rights and protection as victims of labor exploitation. Being undocumented has put them in a precarious situation when it comes to reporting crime to the police, and then accessing justice for prosecution and reparations. A related study has been conducted by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights on labor exploitation in EU member states more generally. However, this study seeks to fill a gap in empirical studies by interviewing and reporting on, and analyzing the accounts of Indonesian undocumented migrants in particular, about their experiences in relation to crimes of labor exploitation in the case of the Netherlands. This is the knowledge gap this research seeks to address. The study’s findings tend to confirm the view that irregular migrants can be understood both as victims of labor exploitation crimes, and as agents seeking justice within the provisions of what is possible, given the priority of the Dutch authorities with protection of the national territory and labor market from ‘unauthorized migrants’.","['undocumented migrants', 'irregular migrants', 'indonesia', 'the netherlands', 'illegal', 'ongedocumenteerd', 'imwu', 'tanpa ijin tinggal', 'migration', 'eu directive']"

Determination of the relation between Chinese OFDI and China's economic performance,"Meijer, Nina","['Wang, J.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"After the opening up policy was implemented in 1978 and China’s joining of the WTO in 2001, Chinese OFDI flow fluctuated heavily. Also, the last few decades, China’s GDP rate has experienced enormous growth. This thesis tries to measure the role that Chinese OFDI has on China’s economic performance. First, a literature review is executed, thereby focusing on Chinese OFDI going into advanced economies. Second an empirical research is performed, concentrating on all Chinese OFDI. The empirical research is performed by using an OLS regression, using data from 1982 to 2015. The dependent variable is China’s GDP per capita growth, the main independent variable is Chinese OFDI flow, the control variables are openness to trade, portfolio investment and initial GDP. In my literature review I found that the main cause for OFDI to effect China’s economic performance is technological spillover during the process of OFDI. In my empirical research I found that the positive influence of Chinese OFDI on China’s GDP growth rate was insignificant.","['China', 'OFDI', 'economy', 'investment', 'trade']"

Hinduism as a World Religion,"Johannes, Edwin Jordan","['Jong, A.F. de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Theology and Religious Studies (Master),Master thesis,en,"This master thesis explores the factors that were crucial in the process that led to the separate category of ‘Hinduism’ in the world religions paradigm. Our present image of Hinduism as a world religion is for a large part a continuation of nineteenth century ideas on Hinduism and religion in general. Due to nineteenth century scholarship and the agency of prominent Hindus, Hinduism as a world religion is presented as a book religion and belief system with the philosophy of Vedanta as its essential doctrinal substantiation. Vedanta is certainly an important and influential facet of Hinduism, but presenting the philosophy of Vedanta as Hinduism’s essence has created a one-dimensional image of Hinduism that does not do justice to the extreme versatility and complexity found in Hinduism. Next to that, emphasising belief and doctrine has led to an undervaluation of all those other aspects of Hinduism, such as rituals, materiality and social relations, all of which are important characteristics of Hinduism.","['Hinduism', 'World Religion', 'Comparative Religion']"
