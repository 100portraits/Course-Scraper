Sacred Sites in Cyber Space: Bridging Indigenous Connections to Place,"Winkler, Isabelle","['Arps, B.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the connection between physical place and identity in Indigenous cultures across Turtle Island (North America), with a focus on how this connection can be preserved in virtual worlds. Indigenous sacred sites hold deep cultural and spiritual significance but have been affected by historical separations enforced by colonial powers. To help mitigate some of these harms, emerging digital platforms and virtual worlds offer a unique avenue for cultural expression and reconnection to land. By studying the experiences within two Indigenous-owned platforms, Our Worlds and AbTeC Island, this research investigates how these platforms construct and reimagine sacred sites digitally. Analysing the interaction between users and platform elements, the study uncovers the opportunities and hurdles they present for cultural preservation. This exploration also extends to the potential role of these virtual sites as proxies for reclaiming colonised lands in instances where their physical return is unfeasible. In this pursuit, the research engages with the primary research question: “How do Indigenous communities in the North American continent utilise virtual reality worlds to recreate sacred sites and challenge notions of land ownership?”. In addition, to address the scholarly tensions that exist around the benefits and detriments of technology use for marginalised communities, the study also probes a secondary query: “How may virtual worlds benefit Indigenous communities in the North American continent despite the neoliberalist infrastructure of these technologies?”. Through this investigation, the study contributes to a broader understanding of the intersection between Indigenous cultural connections to place, emergent digital media, and geopolitical dynamics in two North American nation states that share the same Indigenous lands, underscoring the potential for virtual spaces to reshape the narrative of cultural preservation and land reclamation.","['sacred sites', 'Indigenous communities', 'digital platforms', 'land reclamation', 'digital ethnography']"

De taal omtrent genders op Nederlandse radiozenders: Een kwalitatief onderzoek naar genderneutraal taalgebruik op de Nederlandse radio,"Dekker, Lotte",['Prof. dr. Jaap de Jong'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Genderneutraal taalgebruik is een onderwerp waar veel om te doen is in Nederland. Dit soort taalgebruik is onder andere bedoeld om mensen die zich niet identificeren als man of vrouw, oftewel non-binaire personen, erkenning te kunnen geven middels taalgebruik. Genderneutrale persoonlijke voornaamwoorden, bijvoorbeeld ‘hen’ en ‘die’, kunnen dan gebruikt worden om te verwijzen naar non-binaire personen. Ook kan ervoor gekozen worden om geen aparte beroepstermen meer te gebruiken voor mannen en vrouwen die dezelfde functie bekleden. Verschillende nieuwsmedia spelen hierop in door een stijlboek op te stellen, waarin regels zijn vastgelegd met betrekking tot de toepassing van genderneutraal taalgebruik door journalisten. Echter, voor zover bekend zijn er voor de radio niet zulke stijlboeken. Daarom heb ik onderzocht op welke manier radiopresentatoren van landelijke radiozenders omgaan met genderneutraal taalgebruik. Ik heb acht radiopresentatoren van NPO 3FM, NPO Radio 5, Qmusic, Radio 538 en Radio Veronica casussen voorgelegd met daarin situaties die mogelijk in hun radioprogramma’s zouden kunnen voorkomen, en hen gevraagd een uiting te formuleren zoals zij deze ook in hun radioprogramma zouden formuleren. Op deze manier heb ik getracht zo dicht als mogelijk bij teksten in een echt radioprogramma te komen. Deze data heb ik geanalyseerd aan de hand van een korte inhoudsanalyse. Ook heb ik semi- gestructureerde interviews afgenomen bij de radiopresentatoren, welke geanalyseerd zijn aan de hand van de grounded theory approach. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat genderneutraal taalgebruik bij de meeste respondenten niet direct gebruikt wordt. Radiopresentatoren vinden het belangrijk dat iedereen zich betrokken voelt bij het radioprogramma, en daarom geven zij aan het belangrijk te vinden zich aan te passen aan de behoeftes van personen, dus ook wat de manier van aanspreken betreft. Daarentegen vinden de radiopresentatoren genderneutraal taalgebruik ingewikkeld. Een deel van hen weet genderneutrale uitingen te formuleren, wanneer zij praten met of over een non-binair persoon. Echter, de radiopresentatoren geven aan hier nog niet aan gewend te zijn. Toch verwachten zij dat genderneutraal taalgebruik in de toekomst meer ingeburgerd is, en dat dit soort taalgebruik dan ook op de radio te horen is. De meeste radiopresentatoren hebben hierbij niet het idee dat de radio 5 hierbij een voorbeeldfunctie heeft. De radio zou eerder het taalgebruik volgen dat in de maatschappij wordt gehanteerd.",
‘Elke 8 dagen wordt in Nederland een vrouw vermoord’: Vrouwen als slachtoffer van dodelijk huiselijk geweld in de truecrimepodcast Vrouwenmoord,"Schriel, Luka","['Burger, J.P']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"True crime is een van de populairste podcastgenres, zowel in Nederland als internationaal. Het publiek aan luisteraars van truecrimepodcasts bestaat voor het merendeel uit vrouwen en sommigen beweren zelfs dat het huidige true crime feministisch is. In het internationale academische veld is de laatste jaren een discussie gaande over de al dan niet feministische aard van true crime. Enkele academici stelden criteria op waar feministische true crime aan zou moeten voldoen, in het bijzonder op het gebied van karakterisering van vrouwen als slachtoffer. Internationaal is er al veel literatuur geschreven over discours en framing met betrekking op vrouwen als slachtoffer in true crime en in truecrimepodcasts. In Nederland is het onderzoek naar true crime zeer gering. Er is dus ook nog geen onderzoek gedaan naar discours met betrekking tot vrouwen als slachtoffers in Nederlandse truecrimepodcasts. Het onderzoek in deze MA-eindscriptie beoogt bij te dragen aan het opvullen van deze leemte, door onderzoek te doen naar het discours met betrekking op de slachtoffers in de podcast Vrouwenmoord. In deze scriptie wordt naar aanleiding van de wetenschappelijke discussie over feministische true crime de volgende onderzoeksvraag beantwoord: Welk discours wordt gebruikt in de Nederlandse truecrimepodcast Vrouwenmoord bij het spreken over de slachtoffers? Deze onderzoeksvraag wordt beantwoord aan de hand van een kritische discoursanalyse op basis van Fairclough (2001). Aan de hand van de resultaten van deze inhoudsanalyse wordt ook getoetst of Vrouwenmoord voldoet aan de door het academische veld opgestelde criteria voor feministische true crime. Uit de analyse is gebleken dat de podcast Vrouwenmoord relatief veel feministische elementen bevat. Zo besteedt de podcast uitgebreid aandacht aan het leven van de vermoorde vrouwen en wordt het seksisme aangekaart dat ten grondslag ligt aan dodelijk huiselijk geweld tegen vrouwen. Vrouwenmoord voldoet niet aan alle criteria voor feministische true crime, vooral het gebrek aan etnische diversiteit doet af aan het feministische karakter van de podcast. De resultaten van dit onderzoek nodigen ook uit tot verschillende vervolgonderzoeken naar karakterisering van vrouwen als slachtoffers in true crime.",
Who's Afraid of Epistemic Inequality in the Algorithmic Public Sphere? Defending Deliberation for Digital Misinformation,"Massey, Arushi (Rush)",['Dr. Thomas Fossen'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This master’s thesis investigates the overlapping democratic concerns underlying diverse paradigms of participation proposed for the contemporary digital public sphere. I present conceptual frameworks in Chapters Two and Three to frame the contested problem of political polarization in the digital public sphere. The research highlights the persistent challenge in framing the problem of political polarization, which necessitates a philosophical reconciliation of competing democratic accounts. In my review, I imply a priority for discursive principles for the digital age. Defending the deliberative-republican analysis of the digital public sphere, I identify specific democratic principles at-risk: epistemic equality, inclusivity, media pluralism, mediated exchange, relational equality, competent participation, and civic solidarity. Chapters four and five contain examples to support my core argument, centred on using deliberative processes to counter algorithmic misinformation. I propose three deliberative solutions to enhance formal accountability of social media platforms. At the core of my argument lies the imperative to cultivate a participatory digital culture aligned with citizens' epistemic interests in accuracy and truth, requiring commitment from both governments and citizens. In light of these considerations, I analyse the potential of citizen juries, deliberative polling, and voting advice applications as mechanisms to debunk misinformation and mitigate amplification risks intrinsic to the digital public sphere. In Chapter Four, I additionally outline three plausible challenges to the empirical assumptions I adopt. While the extent of echo-chambers is debated in various democratic perspectives, I argue that prioritizing improved quality of deliberation is essential. This is particularly important due to the increased susceptibility of some citizens to fake news on social media platforms, largely stemming from intergenerational digital media illiteracy. I maintain that addressing algorithmic misinformation through wider deliberation enhances citizens' knowledge and reduces their isolation. In concluding Chapter Five, I highlight the connection between democratic accountability, the formal authorization of social media platforms, and the ongoing discussions surrounding digital power. I align with the republican viewpoint that emphasizes involving citizens in processes of authorization and accountability. Furthermore, I outline potential directions for deeper exploration and discuss the broader impacts of my specific proposals aimed at enhancing the digital competence of citizens.

Dressing the Dutch: Dutch dressmakers in the late nineteenth century,"Schwillens, Lotte","['Cosmo, L.K.', 'Keblusek, M.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"The importance of the labelling of clothes in the late nineteenth century is often associated with couturiers. Their use of labels was aimed at branding both their fashion houses as well as themselves as artist designers. Little attention has been paid to the labelling practices of nineteenth-century dressmakers, although it is known to have been widely applied. Just as few women have been identified while the dressmaking trades were a female dominated industry. For the Netherlands in particular, it is interesting to examine dressmakers and their labelling practices as the lack of Dutch couturiers made Dutch dressmakers the most important figures in the Dutch dressmaking trades of the nineteenth century. This thesis aims to identify Dutch dressmakers through their labels while questioning to what extent late nineteenth-century Dutch dressmakers used their labels for branding their fashion houses and how this related to the Western European fashion practice. The Dutch labelling and dressmaking practices are contextualised and compared with their Western European counterparts through literature analysis and stylistic object-based analysis of labels found in five Dutch museums and seven museums from across Western Europe. The exceptionality of these labelling practices in a female dominated industry is explored as a notion of female agency through the concepts of feminisation, female individualisation and authorship. In addition, this thesis examines how the commercial significance of a dressmaker’s name as a brand name manifested itself in a dressmaker's labels and advertisements. This research results in fourteen biographies of Dutch dressmakers whose labels, together with the Western European labels, can be divided in three stylistic categories. It shows that the strength of the label as a branding tool laid in the continuous use of the same design, just like a signature. This thesis argues that the strongest example of female agency lies in the dressmaker’s name on the label which speaks of an awareness of her own originality and individuality, while at the same time publicly claiming her authorship.","['Dutch dressmakers', 'labelling practices', 'dressmaking practices', 'dressmakers’ biographies', 'branding', 'female agency', 'authorship', 'object-based research', 'stylistic analysis']"

The Future of the EU as a Military Hard Power: A US political perspective,"Koerhuis, Thomas-Jan",['Dr. Maxine David'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The current war in Ukraine and the coinciding tectonic shifts in geopolitics have made discussions about the role of the US as the security provider of the European continent and the increased role of the EU as a security actor within the European security architecture more relevant than ever. It is therefore crucial to understand the US White House perspectives on the development of the EU as a more autonomous security actor. That is why this thesis analyses the research question ‘Has the US perspective on the development of the EU as a more autonomous security actor changed under the administrations of Trump and Biden and if so how?’ by using a critical discourse analysis. The findings underpin that this perspective has changed from a skeptical and critical perspective under the Trump administration to a supportive and stimulating perspective under the Biden administration. This change is meaningful as it has contributed to a context whereby EU defence policies can be realized more easily, while also leading to actual steps of enhanced cooperative US-EU security measures contributing to the further development of the EU as a more autonomous security actor. This change can be explained by two core reasons. First, perceptions will differ when two administrations look at the same international strategic context, which is shifting towards a multipolar world order, through different lenses. Second, in certain circumstances these lenses must bow to the hard reality of the international strategic context if it is sufficiently undeniable. This led to a situation whereby the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine made the Biden administration realize that it needs the EU as a partner in order to defend the US led world order and hegemonial position with multiple geopolitical threats now coming its way, the most important one still coming from China.",

Which Opinions about the EU Led to Voting against Ukraine? Voting Behaviour during the 2016 Ukraine Referendum in the Netherlands Explained Based on more Explanatory Models of Euroscepticism,"Berg, Brigitte van den","['Shaev, B.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The outcome in the Netherlands of the 2016 Ukraine referendum was influenced by Eurosceptic voting. Both this thesis and The National Referendum Research show that a lack of trust in the European Union corresponds with a ‘No’ vote. This thesis takes the analysis of the role of Eurosceptic voting a step further by using more explanatory models of Euroscepticism, giving insight on not only the relationship with Euroscepticism as a linear factor, but also as a multi-dimensional concept and a benchmark concept. With these models, this thesis shows that perceived utility of the EU - separate from trust in the EU - is an important factor that influenced the outcome of this Ukraine referendum. Beyond this, it shows that the referendum voters’ average trust in the EU’s policy and regime is lower than their trust in the national policy and regime. This leads to the conclusion that the Dutch voters have sent a message to The Hague and Brussels that they must put more effort in showing the Netherlands’ benefits through EU membership, for lack of confidence in the EU’s utility has been a key element in not accepting this international association agreement. On a methodological level, this thesis aims to contribute to a new research method predicated on the idea of ‘average towns’ because its data is collected based on the comparability of the municipality of Heemskerk with the Netherlands as a whole, in both demographics and voting outcomes.","['EU Referendum', 'EU', 'Referendum', '2016', 'Netherlands', 'Ukraine', 'Euroscepticism', 'Eurosceptic voting', 'survey', 'Multilevel approach', 'linear', 'European Union', 'public opinion', 'National Referendum Research', 'Brexit', 'Heemskerk', 'average town']"

Natural resources: a catalyst for chaos or order? Rebel governance by resource-rich rebels,"Lokenberg, Sarah","['Van der Maat, E.', 'Duyvesteyn, I.G.B.M.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis problematises the finding that resource-rich rebels do not govern civilians because of their short-term perspectives and fixation on looting which results in predatory behaviour. Therefore, this thesis investigates under what conditions resource-rich rebels do engage in rebel governance. I argue that the characteristics of natural resources affect the exploitation strategy of rebels, which comprises extraction, kidnapping and theft. Those exploitation strategies and the presence or absence of armed competition over resource-rich territory, determine the extent to which resource-rich rebels govern civilians. Three rebel groups are analysed through a focused structured comparison in combination with process tracing. The analyses have revealed that rebels who enjoy both a complete and partial monopoly on resource-rich territory have the ability to divert their resources to rebel governance. Further findings have revealed that rebel groups who adopt extraction as an exploitation strategy engages in governance. In particular, rebel groups mobilise civilians to extract resources in order to acquire economic rents as well as establish civilian administrations to impose taxes and provide security and welfare services. To obtain profits from natural resources, rebels depend on civilians for physical labour. Therefore, rebels establish contractual relations with the local population which results in rebel governance. Hence, resource-rich rebels perceive civilians as valuable assets who can sustain their rebellion. These findings provide an intriguing theoretical framework which renders the first tools to unravel the conditions under which resource-rich rebels govern.","['rebel governance, natural resources, extraction, kidnapping, theft, territorial monopoly, FAPC, CNDP, MEND']"

The Withdrawals of Major Powers from Their Long-term Foreign Interventions in the Last 20 Years: The Importance of this Time Frame to Identify Whether There are Correlations Between the Different Major Powers' Retreats,"Cohen, Olivia",['Eelco van der Maat'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Recently, major powers retreated from their long-term foreign interventions. Their latest withdrawal from both Afghanistan and Mali has been mainly addressed under the scope of international failure within the academic literature. Therefore, this thesis aims to go beyond the international failure spectrum by focusing on the timing of these retreats. To do so, the paper investigates when and why major powers retreated by providing an extensive overview of the international and national socio-political environment of major powers in the last twenty years. Thereby, it proposes a theoretical framework composed of the three following answers; the Completion of Initial Goals; the Normative and Legitimacy Concerns; and a National Strategic Interest. This thesis defends that major powers retreated mainly due to Normative and Legitimacy Concerns as well as National Strategic Interest reasons. It uses process tracing components as well as a comparative structural approach between the cases of the United-States and France. In fine, it provides valuable insights into the general patterns of the major power’s foreign interventions’ mechanisms and retreats. It incorporates a discussion of major powers’ history, their use of media, as well as other topics in the field of international relations influencing the timing of their long-term foreign intervention retreat.",

The Changing Portrayal of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk on Television: A Comparison between Liberation (1994) and Crossroad (2012),"Zhao, Yutong","['Dr. Bruijn, P. de']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is not only recognized as the founder of modern Turkey but also revered as its ""eternal leader."" His image holds significant cultural and political weight in Turkey, and understanding how it is constructed and portrayed in media is crucial for comprehending the evolution of Turkish national identity. This thesis explores the portrayal of Atatürk's image in cultural products, specifically through TV series, and how this portrayal has evolved over time, with a focus on the comparison between the TV series Liberation (1994) and Crossroad (2012). Using the research methodology of film analysis, this paper conducts a comparative study of two television series from content and context perspectives. It argues that while both television series emphasize Atatürk’s role as a Turkish nationalist, dedicated to modernization and democratic reforms, Liberation attempts to depict him as an almost unopposed omnipotent leader and retells the official history. In contrast, Crossroad highlights the significant disagreements between the Republican People's Party officials and Atatürk, as well as societal opposition to the party’s rule in the context of the establishment of a loyal opposition party, Liberal Republican Party. These differences are closely related to the changes in Atatürk veneration and the secular institutions’ status from the 1990s to the 2010s, shifts in the government's promotion of national identity, and the policies of the Justice and Development Party government in the 2010s.

Student Translation of Japanese BodyPart and Non-Body-Part Idioms,"Woude, Laureen van der","['Dorst, A.G.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines body-part and non-body-part idiom translation by student translators from Japanese into English or Dutch. Several researches have been conducted regarding the perceived translatability of body-part idioms, but the actual translation of these idioms as well as student translation has not been widely researched. Body parts are a major aspect of figurative language, but body-part idiom translation, the image of body parts in translation, is an area that is under researched. By examining the strategies student translators use as well as their reflections on the translations, this study argues that both body-part and non-body-part idioms are preferably translated using figurative language. In addition, body parts and their image (or other images) can and do play a part in the translation decision, however, no strong preference for body parts to be transferred can be detected in this study. However, this study also argues that other images, might play a role in the translation decision for student translators.","['idiom translation, body parts, Japanese, images, student translation']"

Enlightenment in the Name of Rejection? Chinese Straussians’ self-image within the intellectual debate in post-1989 China,"Zhao, Peng",['Dr. Vincent K.L. Chang'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Existing literature on the intellectual field in the post-1989 China has focused predominantly on the intellectuals of the mainstream trends of thoughts and “-isms”, including for example, the neo-conservativism and the Liberals. While scholarships contribute to the discussion from a variety of perspectives, one genre has probed into the divergent self-images of the mainstream intellectuals in the post-1989 era. Despite the mainstream trends of thoughts and “-isms”, however, the intellectual field of the post-1989 China had also comprised marginal trends of thoughts and inconspicuous intellectuals respectively, for example, Chinese Straussians. Current studies revolving the rise of Chinese Straussians have so far concentrated mainly on its critiques on the mainstream trends but have not yet discussed whether Chinese Straussians’ self-image is divergent from the mainstream. In this regard, this thesis is proposed to study the self-image of Chinese Straussians and to compare it with the self-images of the mainstream intellectuals. This thesis will thus contribute to the existing academic debate by providing a more sophisticated understanding of Chinese Straussians, one of the marginal threads of the post-1989 intellectual field, that is considered to have fundamentally challenged the mainstream intellectuals.","['Post-1989 China', 'Chinese Intellectuals', 'Self-Image', 'Chinese Straussians']"

Nicolina Sant and Aaïcha Bergamin take a walk through the Stoofsteeg: An exploration of sex workers' urban citizenship in Amsterdam,"Deekman, Melchior","['Pluskota, M.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The discourse surrounding sex work in Amsterdam has evolved, reflecting shifting approaches by municipal authorities and stakeholders. Currently, a proposal for an ""erotic center"" seeks to relocate sex work from the Wallen district to address issues of over-tourism and congestion. However, this proposition has ignited controversy, as sex workers voice concerns about safety, social networks, and potential workspace loss. Researchers and activists advocate for recognizing sex work as tangible heritage to preserve its history and narratives. Despite initiatives of activists and advocates to document and safeguard the sector's history through the website www.sekswerkerfgoed.nl and the Prostitution Information Center, academic exploration of sex workers' experiences and sex work heritage in the Netherlands remains limited. Narratives from sex workers of color, migrant sex workers, and marginalized voices are often overlooked. Media portrayals often perpetuate stigmatization and negative stereotypes about sex work. The life stories of Nicolina Sant and Aaïcha Bergamin, two sex workers from the 20th century, offer valuable insights into Dutch sex work. Their narratives encompass diverse perspectives, encompassing ethnic backgrounds, cultural nuances, gender, and sexuality. Incorporating these stories enriches historical research on sex work, fostering a deeper comprehension of the industry and its intersections with urban life. Using the concept of urban citizenship, which emphasizes self-identity and recognition, challenges conventional notions tied to nationhood. Sex workers' claims to citizenship impact urban planning and city politics, influencing the socio-spatial fabric of the city, and reorienting research on sex workers to focus on agency rather than victimhood. Analyzing the stories of Aaïcha and Nicolina through this lens reflects on the idea of sex work as heritage while supplying an intersectional perspective to sex work history in the Netherlands.","['citizenship', 'urban citizenship', 'sex work', 'sex worker', ""sex workers' citizenship"", 'agency', 'intimate citizenship', 'sexual citizenship', 'economic citizenship', 'heritage', 'sex work heritage', 'Wallen', 'Red Light District', 'gender', 'gender and sexuality', 'intersectionality', 'race formations', 'sex industry']"

In 2015 already, Europe had faced a sharp increase in demands for asylum, following the Syrian civil war. Immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers have been generally marginalized in recent years in Europe, through an ‘us and them’ rhetoric. The welcoming of Ukrainian refugees however, demonstrated a never seen before impetus for support and integration, proving the European ability to set up effective and quick responses to humanitarian crisis. Why then, were such means never deployed before? Why did European member-states never demonstrate a similar level of cohesion before? And what does that say about the ways in which the European Commission sets its migration policies? This thesis will shed light on the European Commission’s setting of policy- responses on migration, through a comparative study of the Syrian and Ukrainian migration crises, to explore the potential ‘double-standard’ on refugees.","['Migration', 'Double-standard', 'Racism', 'Solidarity', 'Europe.']"

Corruption and land grabbing in the palm oil industry of Riau,"Bekkering, Jasper","['Hadiprayitno, I.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the last decade, the Indonesian corruption eradication commission (KPK) and various Indonesian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have reported cases related to corrupt behaviour and land grabbing by palm oil companies. Thus, corruption remains a persistent problem within the Indonesian palm oil industry. This thesis has investigated the underlying causes of this persistent corruption by analysing the motivations of actors in two corruption cases in Riau, in which the shareholders of two large palm oil companies are accused of bribing public officials in exchange for acquiring land rights permits (HGU). The third case study provides evidence of land grabbing associated with palm oil operations. Four main theories on the motivations behind corruption have been considered in the assessment of the three case studies. Our conclusion is that all four theories provide a partial explanation for the motivation behind corruption, but in isolation, none of the four theories provides an exhaustive explanation. In addition, this study contributes to the understanding of the incentives and motivations for actors in the palm oil industry to engage in corrupt behaviour and land grabbing.","['Corruption, Land grabbing, Palm oil industry, Riau,']"

In particular, using Erving Goffman’s question of “what is it that is going on” to identify whether Ajam Media Collective and the Iranian Diaspora Collective are aware of the many forms of feminism that exist in Iran or whether they continue to enforce the dominant Western feminist doctrine in their framing of Iranian women and their participation in the current movement. In the examination, the focus is on the traditional narratives of the protection scenario and Orientalism to better understand the politics of pity and how the research by Joanna de Groot, Saba Mahmood, and Sara Mameni provides alternative understandings of what it means to be a feminist. Concluding that even though both organizations have a different approach in the framing of Iranian women and their feminism, it becomes clear that the dominant feminist doctrine did influence the diasporic community.","['Erving Goffman, media framing analysis, Iranian women-led movement, Western versus Islamic feminism']"

Framing The Diplomatic Feminine: from the Chevalier(e) d’Eon to the Pompadour; exploring the ascendency of gender in mid-eighteenth century diplomatic narratives,"Rixhon, Clementine",['Jasper van der Steen'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The nascent field of ‘New Diplomatic History’ has so far been focussed on masculinity and formality. Women’s contributions are largely overlooked or merely assessed through the concept of the diplomatic wife. This thesis aims to enlarge the scope of the study through the lens of feminist theory and sociology to allow the inclusion of hitherto unrecognised and forgotten informal diplomatic agents and the exploration of the complex relationship between informal diplomacy and gender. The juxtaposition of the cases of the Chevalier(e) d’Eon and the Marquise de Pompadour serves to explore the landscape of diplomatic informality and femininity in the eighteenth century. These figures prove that women had diplomatic agency beyond marriage and formality. De Pompadour’s informal status doubtlessly allowed her to navigate an array of diplomatic spaces, from the arts to warfare to dinner diplomacy. Similarly, d’Eon enjoyed a unique social position at the intersection of genders which allowed them to position themselves as a role model to women. The unique character of these figures is perhaps not their sex but their ability to shape their story despite the patriarchal structures constraining them to informality and misogyny. This thesis will assess how d’Eon and de Pompadour cultivated their agency by shaping and embracing their narrative. Ultimately it will be recognised that in the case of d’Eon and de Pompadour, diplomatic femininity granted them the freedom to move between roles and spaces.",

Since the Percy Commission in 1957 in England, and the Commission of Inquiry into Mental Illness in 1966 in Ireland, both countries have strived to modernise and improve the quality of their mental healthcare systems. Despite this, they have experienced several shortfalls surrounding funding, staffing and community care amongst other issues. As a result of these problems, both countries have some of the highest rates of mental illness in Europe, with 18.5 percent of Irish people and 17.7 percent of English people experiencing at least one mental illness. While both England and Ireland inherited a similar system based around asylums and a focus on long-term institutionalisation the outcomes for the respective countries were vastly different. Additionally, both countries have moved towards a community-based approach in the hope to rehabilitate and reintegrate patients into the community. Though, England has seen lower rates of hospitalisation and shorter hospital stays for mental illness than in Ireland, as well as historically having lower rates of mental illness. However, since the 1990s, English rates of mental illness have been increasing gradually. As a result, English rates of mental illness are nearly that of Ireland. By discussing the historic developments in mental healthcare in the two countries and issues around welfare and healthcare, the causes for this discrepancy as well as the recent increases in the rate of mental illness can hopefully be explained.","['Mental Health', 'Social Issues', 'Homelessness', 'Healthcare', 'Poverty', 'Welfare', 'England', 'Ireland', '1950-2019']"

This new perspective, in line with the poststructuralist de-emphasis of the figure of the literary author, diminishes the role of the literary author in the meaning of a literary text. This allows the adaptation to be examined in relation to the adapted text. Which aids the acknowledgement of their interconnection, without discrediting the adaptation, and encourages the examination of the respective cultural and social contexts of the adapted text, and the adaptation. However, images of literary authors return throughout pop culture, even in cinematic adaptations. This thesis is concerned with the portrayal of literary authors in cinematic adaptations of their literary works. In relation to Barthes' 'The Death of the Author' and other theories on literary authorship, this thesis examines the potential function of a representation of the literary author in an adaptation of their literary text.","['authorship, film, adaptation studies']"

"Exploring Sentiment Analysis for Plot Extraction in Literary Studies: Methodologies, Replication, and Critical Evaluation","Pouli, Jim",['Dr. P.A.F. Verhaar'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Sentiment analysis is the method of computationally recognising opinions stated in a piece of text, particularly to identify if the writer has a positive, negative, or neutral attitude towards a given topic. Although sentiment analysis is commonly used to analyse short texts on social media platforms, its application in literary research has gained traction in recent years. The emergence of sentiment analysis tools, such as Syuzhet, has notably expanded the research possibilities in this field. However, despite these advancements, there remains a need to further explore and understand the strengths and limitations of sentiment analysis in the context of literary analysis. The aim of this thesis is to further the body of knowledge about the use of sentiment analysis as a technique for plot extraction. Throughout this thesis, I experiment with a modified form of the social media analysis tool VADER. While this method proofs to work as an effective tool for extracting sentiment from linear stories, it still shows limitation on a sentence-to-sentence basis. Moreover, I use this tool to replicate an often-cited study by Reagan et al., where it was stated that the majority of stories can be categorized in six basic ‘plot shapes’. I argue that while most of these shapes can still be identified using an alternative sentiment analysis technique, this technique occasionally classifies a story into a different shape than Reagan et al.’s analysis did. I conclude by giving a critical evaluation of sentiment analysis as a tool for plot extraction. Since the ‘plot’ of a story is a multifaceted concept, we cannot simply argue that a sentiment analysis graph displays the progression of plot. Nonetheless, modifications can be made to get a fuller understanding of the narrative of a story.","['Sentiment analysis', 'Digital Humanities', 'Plot', 'Narratology']"
(Re-)Collections: Reading the Family Memoir as Archive,"Olters, Hanna Ware","[""Dr. Irene O'Daly""]",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In recent decades, our understanding of archives has evolved beyond the familiar, institutional archive carefully tended to by a small group of trained professionals. Movements such as postcolonialism and postcustodialism, combined with the digital turn, have allowed interest in other, less conventional forms of archiving to emerge. As such, the concept of an archival continuum (that is, the understanding of archives as evolving and participatory systems rather than fixed institutions) has been accepted by archival scholarship. This thesis investigates whether printed family memoirs that incorporate visual material from family archives can be placed along said archival continuum. Four such memoirs – The Hare with Amber Eyes (2010), In Memory of Memory (2018), Heimat: A German Family Album (2018), and Letters to Camondo (2021) – have been selected as case studies by which to examine their potential archival and evidentiary value. Each memoir is a work of postmemory – following Marianne Hirsch, the authors are processing generational trauma passed down as a result of the Holocaust. I argue that it is not only the narratives that lend them archival value, but also their inclusion of archival material. As I will show, understanding published memoirs as archives supports an expanded recognition of non-professional memory work as archival. Importantly, the increased accessibility of published memoirs to a general audience versus that of conventional archives allows for greater interaction with the preserved objects, and so aids in supporting the societal memorialization of the Holocaust. By focusing on the paper editions of the books, I am able to examine the unique benefits and challenges of the printed book as a form of accessible archive and memory object.","['archives', 'memory', 'postmemory', 'memoir', 'family memoir', 'book']"

One’s Place: Privilege and Responsibility in (Post-)Apartheid White Writing,"Zijlstra, Hester","['Cameron-Gardos, P.S.', ""O'Donnell, M.P.""]",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The era of Western colonialism and slavery has ended, but racism and discrimination still exist and the privileged position that White people still have in Western society makes it difficult for people of colour to trust them, no matter these White people’s often good intentions. Similarly, but also in a more visibly extreme way, the struggle against racism in South Africa did not end with the abolition of Apartheid. Scholars think differently about what the appropriate response would be of White South Africans to their dark history. Should they withdraw in silence and humility? Alternatively, should they play an active role in the future of the country? And how? From her position as a White Dutch woman, Zijlstra has explored the issues of race, identity and progressive change in South African literature. For White South African authors, silence was never an option, but they were nonetheless aware of their ambiguous position. With the analysis of three novels from such authors (Burger’s Daughter (1979) by Nadine Gordimer, The Rights of Desire (2000) by André Brink, and The Promise (2021) by Damon Galgut), this thesis aims to contribute to a nuanced view on both the controversy around the position of well-intentioned White people in a position of privilege, and their possibilities to take responsibility. The theorists who inform the analysis are Michael Rothberg (2019) with his concept of the implicated subject, Melissa Steyn (2001) with her research on the fragmentation of White identity in South Africa after Apartheid, Shannon Sullivan (2006) with her theory on unconscious racial habits, and Zoë Wicomb (2018) with her critical eye on myths of traditional culture and identity, as well as on the responsibility of literary authors.","['White privilege', 'place', 'responsibility', 'Apartheid', 'deconstruction']"

Art of Embassy: Material Culture of Exchange between the Ryukyu Kingdom and Ming-Qing China,"Tsai, Yi-Chien","['Gerritsen, A.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Ryukyu, also known as Okinawa, is the southernmost prefecture of Japan today. However, these islands were once an independent Kingdom and played a crucial role as a link between Northeast and Southeast Asia during the maritime period. Established in 1429, the Ryukyu Kingdom existed as a separate state for nearly 450 years until it was incorporated into Okinawa Prefecture by the Meiji Japanese government in 1879. Scholarship on Okinawa has predominantly focused on post-war geopolitics or the general exchanges between China, Japan, and Ryukyu in the early modern period, often relying on textual accounts. Unfortunately, the arts of Okinawa have largely been overlooked by the Western world due to the prevailing notion that Japan is a homogeneous culture, disregarding local variations and leading Western Japanologists to lack specialized interest in Japan's peripheral regions. Similarly, ethnographic museums in the West have limited collections related to the Ainu people. These circumstances suggest that contemporary studies on Japan are largely influenced by the country's nationalist concept of a unified nation, particularly after the Meiji Restoration. China had been sending diplomatic envoys to the Ryukyu Kingdom since the Ming Hongwu Emperor, and this practice continued until the mid-19th century when Japan annexed Ryukyu and made it part of its territory. The four-century-long diplomatic history between Ryukyu and China can be considered the golden age of Okinawan history, during which numerous art forms thrived, and Okinawans took great pride in their unique culture and language. The Okinawans referred to the vessels carrying envoys from China as Okansen (meaning ""crown ships""), and the primary envoys who crowned the Ryukyu King were called Sappōshi. Although the Ryukyu Kingdom was officially established as a unified dynasty by King Shō Hashi in 1429, the tributary relationship with Ming China had already begun in 1372, during the reign of the Ming Hongwu Emperor and King of Chūzan. In addition to the vassal and tributary relationship with China, the Kingdom maintained careful relations with Japan after the invasion by the Japanese Satsuma-Shimazu clan based in Kagoshima, Kyushu in 1609. The Ryukyu Kingdom pursued a diplomacy of equidistance and multilateralism, establishing trade with China, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asian countries as the foundation of its economy. Consequently, people, goods, and information from various Asian countries were exchanged, giving rise to an international ""Ryukyu culture."" This study aims to explore the enduring but relatively understudied tributary relationship between the suzerain and vassal states through an examination of historical documents and material culture.

Verstraten']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis is focused on the portrayal of Arabs and Muslims in post 9/11 war films and television shows. The case studies used to do research on this topic were the popular and mainstream productions: The Kingdom (2007), Lone Survivor (2013), and Homeland (2011). The aim of this research was to examine how Arabs and Muslims were depicted in these productions and identify the underlying causes of these portrayals. The analyzation reveals that the majority of Arab/Muslim characters were portrayed as violent and dangerous, reinforcing negative stereotypes that originated from orientalism and have been incorporated in films since the beginning of the twentieth century. The stereotypes that have been identified within the case studies include: the Islamic rage boy, the savage and violent terrorist, the sex-deprived Muslim, and the portrayal of Islam as a violent religion. In order to be as thorough as possible, the following sub-questions have been answered: (1) How was the connection between the U.S. Military and Hollywood constructed, and what did it entail before 9/11? (2) How did the combination of a jingoistic sense of national identity, desire for retribution and the relationship between Hollywood and the Ministry of Defense, create the ideal circumstances for the vilification of Arabs and Muslims in the wake of 9/11? (3) In which way were Arabs and Muslims depicted/portrayed in in post-9/11 war films and television such as The Kingdom, Lone Survivor and Homeland? The first sub-question has displayed why it was “normal” for Hollywood producers to meet up with the people from the U.S. government by describing the history of the relationship of Hollywood and the U.S. military. The second sub-question was focused on how the American society reacted towards the 9/11 attacks and what kind of rhetoric was popularized as a consequence. This rhetoric created the ideal circumstances for the vilification of Arabs and Muslims. In the last sub-question, analyzed scenes, visuals, and dialogue from the case studies showcase that Arab and Muslim characters were depicted in a negative light. The latter meant that the events of 9/11 still had a substantial influence on the productions and it showed that Matusitz, Bayraktaroğlu and Westwell were wrong by claiming that the tone of post 9/11 cinema had a turnaround from 2004 onwards as a result of the Abu Ghraib scandal, because the negative stereotypes were still very prominent within the case studies.","['Film, Islam, Arab, Stereotypes, Orientalism']"

The Role of Preprints in Scholarly Communication: Complementing the Functions of Academic Publishing,"Kraakman, Demi","['Praal, F.E.W.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Preprints are complete scholarly manuscripts that have not (yet) been through a formal peer review process and are made publicly available, often by uploading them to a preprint server, which can be accessed without any limitations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, preprints gained popularity because they allow for rapid dissemination of research, which was vital at that point. Yet, this increased popularity of preprints does not appear to have lessened since the recent end of the pandemic and it is not expected that it will rapidly diminish either. Instead, it has even spread to fields that have arguably had little to do with COVID research. It would appear that the pandemic was the boost preprints needed to become more widely accepted across many academic fields. Now, many contemporary critics argue that preprints are becoming ‘a common part of the scholarly publishing process’ and are referring to preprints as an ‘important tool’ in scholarly publishing, a way to ‘complement’ the current system. This thesis analyses which functions of academic publishing are complemented by preprints and in what way they prove to be important tools within the existing system. In order to do so, the thesis commences with a comparative analysis of five separate theories regarding what the functions of (academic) publishing are and builds a new theoretical framework with which to analyse preprints and their role.","['preprint', 'preprint server', 'academic publishing', 'functions of publishing', 'Bhaskar', 'Clark and Phillips', 'Origgi and Ramello', 'Roosendaal and Geurts', 'Anderson', 'complementary']"

Navigating AI Portrayal in Speculative Fiction (1950-2015): Uncovering Insights with Computational Analysis,"Beentjes, Manon",['Dr. P. Verhaar'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores how literature has represented AI and evaluates the effectiveness of computers in assisting us to answer this question. This representation is studied starting from the period just before it was born as a scientific discipline in 1956, and ending in 2015. It first sets out to examine both the optimistic and the fatalistic view of AI and traces the sources of the fear of AI, and then continues to use computational methods to research the portrayal of AI in fiction. To facilitate the analysis, 39 speculative fiction books were filtered and a file was created that contained sentences on AI in the books. This enabled a study of animacy, sentiments, emotions, and synonyms of ‘helpful and ‘doom’ across the corpus. During the study, the flaws of computational analysis are highlighted, especially its lack of interpretation skills and inability to fully understand context. Consequently, this provides difficulty in drawing definitive conclusions about AI’s representation specifically. Still, despite its limitations, the study is able to conclude that most AI-themed fiction conveys a positive message to the reader.","['AI, Artificial Intelligence, Speculative Fiction, Computational Analysis, AI Representation in Fiction']"

By examining the socioeconomic policies of the Christian Social Party and their impact on the experiences of ‘ordinary’ people, this research aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the Austrian interwar period. The analysis draws upon diaries and local administration records from a smaller Lower Austrian town to explore how people experienced economic crises and how these experiences influenced their perceptions of politics through their lived experiences. The findings reveal a complex interplay between economic factors and political sentiments among the Austrian population. The economic crises faced by individuals were profound and enduring, marked by high unemployment rates, hyperinflation, and deteriorating living conditions. The Christian Social Party's policies, while initially promising, ultimately failed to effectively address these economic hardships effectively. As a result, a sense of disillusionment and despair took hold, leading to a growing disaffection with the political establishment. By shedding light on the perspectives of ordinary participants in democracy, this study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the interwar period. It emphasises the importance of considering the voices and experiences of the general population, which are often overshadowed by the dominant political discourse.","['Austria', 'Interwar Period']"

Bronnen aan boord bij de lokale krant: Een onderzoek naar de macht van nieuwsbronnen bij lokale nieuwsmedia in Zuid-Holland,"Duivenvoorden, Alexander","['Vandendaele, A.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De bron is van cruciaal belang voor de journalist. Alleen door gebruik te maken van betrouwbare bronnen, is de journalist in staat om het publiek te voorzien van betrouwbare en verifieerbare informatie. De bron voorziet de journalist van de informatie waarop nieuwsverhalen zijn gebaseerd. Bronnen spelen daarnaast een rol in het werk van de journalist. Dat blijkt onder meer uit het feit dat geïnterviewde bronnen de kans krijgen om teksten na te lezen voor publicatie. Deze studie poogt bloot te leggen welke macht bronnen hebben in de lokale journalistiek. De leefwereld van de eindredacteur van de lokale krant is daarbij het uitgangspunt, gezien hij de kwaliteit van de krant dient te bewaken. Voor de kwaliteit van lokale journalistiek wordt al langere tijd gevreesd. Zo zorgen financiële tekorten sinds de digitalisering van het nieuws voor een redactiekrimp en een stijgende werkdruk. Het werk van de eindredacteur veranderde daardoor ook. Er bestaan in onderzoek zorgen over hoe dit ook het brongebruik in de lokale journalistiek beïnvloedt. Veelal zouden lokale kranten te weinig bronnen gebruiken, persberichten meteen doorplaatsen en moeizaam de lokale samenleving representeren. Dit heeft tot gevolg dat de lokale krant tekortschiet in het vervullen van haar drie functies: informeren, controleren en verbinden. Dat is onwenselijk, want lokale burgers moeten goed geïnformeerd zijn over de politiek zodat ze onder meer weloverwogen beslissingen maken bij de lokale verkiezingen. In eerder onderzoek naar bovenstaande problematiek spelen vier onderwerpen een grote rol. Deze zijn ook van belang voor deze studie: de bron, de lokale journalistiek, het nieuwsproductieproces en de eindredacteur als kwaliteitsbewaker. Om vast te stellen welke rol de bron speelt in het nieuwsproductieproces op lokale redacties volgens de eindredacteur, zijn twaalf interviews afgenomen met eindredacteuren bij lokale kranten in Zuid-Holland. Uit de resultaten kwam naar voren dat de macht van de bron groot is. De lokale inwoner is de belangrijkste bron van de lokale eindredacteur. Daaronder vallen de lezers, institutionele bronnen en mensen uit het verenigingsleven. Deze bronnen voorzien de lokale eindredacteur van veel nieuwsonderwerpen. Eindredacteuren selecteren wekelijks uit honderden mails en persberichten welke onderwerpen er in de krant komen. Bij deze ‘in-kant’ van het nieuws, zitten ook verzoeken tot interviews. Eindredacteuren bevestigen dat bronnen hen meestal benaderen voor een interview. Aan het einde van het nieuwsproductieproces krijgen bronnen de kans om artikelen voor publicatie na te lezen. Ze mogen suggesties doen om feitelijke onjuistheden aan te laten passen, maar gaan vaak een stap verder dan wat eindredacteuren verstaan onder ‘feitelijk onjuist’. Zo nemen bronnen uitspraken terug of herschrijven ze quotes. Daarbij geeft de eindredacteur niet-institutionele bronnen met persoonlijke verhalen meer vrijheid dan institutionele bronnen en mensen met belangen. Bronnen zijn ten slotte doorgaans bekenden van de eindredacteur. Dit komt doordat de eindredacteur zelf onderdeel uitmaakt van de lokale gemeenschap of doordat hij de bron eerder sprak voor een interview. De eindredacteur bij lokale media is namelijk verantwoordelijk voor het volledige nieuwsproductieproces van een krant, en neemt dus ook zelf interviews af. Echter, de eindredacteur vindt het belangrijk om verschillende bronnen in de gemeenschap te spreken om representatief te zijn. Daarnaast zou hij geen mensen uit zijn nabije omgeving interviewen in verband met belangenverstrengeling. Hoewel dus blijkt dat de macht van de bron groot is, blijft het voor de eindredacteur belangrijk om een onafhankelijke kwalitatieve krant te maken. Hierbij is het voor hen voornamelijk belangrijk dat de lokale journalistiek ‘voor en door bewoners’ wordt gemaakt.","['lokale journalistiek, Zuid-Holland, brongebruik, lokale krant, huis-aan-huisbladen']"

Genderneutrale taal in het nieuwsverhaal? Hoe presentatoren en eindverantwoordelijken van Nederlandse televisienieuwsprogramma’s zeggen om te gaan met genderneutraal taalgebruik en het gebruik van de term queer als neutrale term voor de lhbti+-gemeenschap,"Gerven, Mitchell van","['Jong, J.C. de']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Genderneutraal en inclusief taalgebruik zijn vaak onderwerp van discussie op veel nieuwsredacties. Er bestaan verschillende studies over hoe de geschreven journalistiek hiermee omgaat. Er is nog geen onderzoek gedaan naar genderneutraal taalgebruik in de gesproken journalistiek zoals in presentatieteksten. Daarom focust dit onderzoek zich op Nederlandse televisienieuwsprogramma’s. Specifiek komen in deze analyse presentatoren en eindverantwoordelijken van twee publieke organisaties (NOS en EenVandaag) en twee commerciële partijen (RTL Nieuws/EditieNL en Hart van Nederland) aan het woord. Met hun inzichten wordt de hoofdvraag: ‘Hoe zeggen presentatoren en eindverantwoordelijken van Nederlandse televisienieuwsprogramma’s om te gaan met genderneutrale voornaamwoorden en neutrale beroepsaanduidingen?’ beantwoord. De deelvragen richten zich op genderneutrale voornaamwoorden en neutrale beroepsaanduidingen, de rol van nieuwsmedia en het gebruik van queer. Uit de literatuur komt naar voren dat de media een belangrijke rol spelen bij het vastleggen en veranderen van taalnormen, omdat de taal die de media gebruiken gezien wordt als de standaard (Van Poecke & Van den Bulck, 1991 – p. 83). Taal moet als het ware een spiegel zijn van de maatschappij waarbij de journalistiek verantwoordelijk is voor representatieve berichtgeving. De media kijken dan ook naar de (gender)neutrale taalontwikkeling over beroepsaanduidingen en voornaamwoorden voor non-binaire personen in het bijzonder. Daarnaast is queer als overkoepelende en meer neutrale term voor de lhbti+-gemeenschap, waar non-binaire personen onder vallen, opgenomen als taalontwikkeling, omdat queer vaker door organisaties wordt gebruikt. Uit de theorie blijkt dat een stijlboek met taalrichtlijnen een belangrijk hulpmiddel kan zijn voor nieuwsredacties om stereotypering en discriminatie tegen te gaan (De Jong, 2016 – p. 17; Sczesny et al. 2016 – p. 8). Uit de resultaten komt naar voren dat nieuwsredacties al veelvuldig gebruikmaken van neutrale beroepsaanduidingen en daarbij kiezen voor de neutrale vorm voor iedereen, bijvoorbeeld schrijver in plaats van schrijfster. Genderneutrale voornaamwoorden (hen/hun, die/diens) zijn nog niet bewust in een nieuwstekst voorgekomen en verdienen volgens de respondenten ook altijd een inleiding, omdat woorden die bij de kijker nog niet ingeburgerd zijn, uitleg nodig hebben. De begrijpelijkheid van een nieuwstekst staat voorop. Een term als ‘queer’ zal dan ook pas gebruikelijk worden als het woord in de samenleving breed gebruikt wordt. De deelnemers aan dit onderzoek vinden dat de media een voorbeeldfunctie hebben, maar in inclusief taalgebruik niet voorop moeten lopen. Over wanneer je in taalgebruik precies vooroploopt, verschillen de opvattingen. Zo neemt het ene medium bewust inclusieve stijlregels op en de andere niet. Maar elk nieuwsprogramma behandelt met respect dergelijke inclusieve casussen en kijkt altijd hoe het voor de kijker zo begrijpelijk mogelijk blijft.","['genderneutraal', 'voornaamwoorden', 'lhbti', 'queer', 'genderneutraal taalgebruik', 'nieuws', 'journaal', 'presentator', 'hoofdredacteur', 'eindredacteur', 'diversiteit', 'inclusiviteit']"
Op de kaart: De professionalisering van de Nederlandse voedseljournalistiek,"Kimmijser, Megin","['Burger, J. P.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Deze studie dient als een wetenschappelijke verkenning van de voedseljournalistiek in Nederland. Daarbij heeft dit onderzoek als doel inzicht te bieden in de professionalisering van voedseljournalistiek en de positionering van voedseljournalisten in hun dagelijkse praktijk. Een beter begrip van de professionalisering van de voedseljournalistiek kan het werk van voedseljournalisten ten goede komen. De onderzoeksvraag die in deze studie wordt beantwoord, luidt: ‘Hoe ervaren voedseljournalisten de professionalisering van de voedseljournalistiek in Nederland?’ Deze vraag wordt onderzocht aan de hand van twee concepten: ‘grenswerk’ en ‘rolopvattingen’. Dit onderzoek is kwalitatief van aard. Om antwoord te kunnen geven op de onderzoeksvraag zijn twaalf semigestructureerde interviews afgenomen bij Nederlandse voedseljournalisten. Deze zijn geanalyseerd en in verband gebracht met voorgaand onderzoek. Op deze manier is verkend hoe de respondenten hun beroep afbakenen en onderzocht hoe de respondenten hun rollen in de maatschappij percipiëren. Nederlandse voedseljournalisten zeggen het belangrijk te vinden om hun vakgebied af te bakenen voor aangrenzende actoren buiten (zoals foodinfluencers en -bloggers) en binnen (zoals restaurantrecensenten en voedselcolumnisten) het vakgebied. In de antwoorden van de respondenten zijn enkele grenswerktechnieken (zoals het benadrukken van de traditionele waarden van de journalist) en rolopvattingen (zoals het informeren van het publiek) herkend, waarmee zij dit (onbewust) zeggen te doen. Aangrenzende actoren worden echter noch geaccepteerd, noch definitief verstoten uit het vakgebied. De respondenten kijken namelijk naar hen voor inspiratie, werken met ze samen en nemen werkzaamheden van ze over. In die zin bewegen voedseljournalisten zich dicht bij de grenzen van de aangrenzende actoren, in plaats van andersom. De respondenten zeggen dat uitdagingen zoals de komst van nieuwe media het lastig maken om grip op de professionalisering van het vakgebied te houden. Zij beweren daarom constant de grenzen van het vakgebied te herdefiniëren. Voor vervolgonderzoek wordt er voorgesteld een inhoudsanalyse van voedsel journalistieke content uit te voeren, om te achterhalen of de voedseljournalisten de herkende rolopvattingen en grenswerktechnieken ook uitvoeren in de praktijk. Tot slot zal er meer vergelijkend onderzoek verricht moeten worden naar de professionalisering, grenswerktechnieken en rolopvattingen van voedseljournalisten in andere landen. Deze studie dient als pleidooi voor meer onderzoek naar de lifestylejournalistiek en legt de basis voor toekomstige studies naar de professionalisering van de voedseljournalistiek.","['Culinaire journalistiek, voedseljournalistiek, grenswerk, rolpercepties, boundary work, role perceptions']"

Kwalitatief onderzoek naar brongebruik en verificatiegedrag van (wetenschaps)journalisten bij berichtgeving over het coronavirus,"Schreurs, Evelien","['Burger, J.P.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Journalisten bevonden zich op onbekend terrein bij verslaggeving over het coronavirus: weinig was bekend over de verspreiding en impact van het virus, maar tegelijkertijd was er een grote nieuwsbehoefte vanuit het publiek. Een uitzonderlijke situatie als deze kan zorgen voor veranderingen in journalistieke waarden, de manier waarop journalisten met hun bronnen omgaan, en verificatieverdrag. In dit onderzoek wordt onderzocht hoe (wetenschaps)journalisten de betrouwbaarheid van een bron beoordelen en hoe zij bepalen om al dan niet aan verificatie te doen. Dit is onderzocht door middel van 14 semi-gestructureerde interviews met journalisten die producties maakten over de meer technische aspecten van het coronavirus. Uit deze interviews blijkt dat nieuws over het coronavirus verschilt van ‘regulier’ nieuws omdat het ander nieuws overschaduwt, er weinig over bekend is, wetenschap prominenter in het nieuws is, en doordat journalisten het idee hebben onder een vergrootglas te werken. Bij het selecteren van bronnen is de expertise van de bron verreweg het belangrijkste voor de journalisten. Verder gebruiken journalisten graag bronnen die ze vertrouwen, en zijn er pragmatische redenen om een bron te kiezen zoals de beschikbaarheid van de bron. Bij het beoordelen van de betrouwbaarheid van wetenschappelijk onderzoek letten journalisten op de auteur, methoden en conclusies van het onderzoek, ook leggen ze onderzoeken regelmatig voor aan wetenschappers of collega’s die de kwaliteit van het onderzoek kunnen beoordelen. Voor journalisten is de voornaamste reden om aan verificatie te doen het principe dat je altijd meer dan één bron gebruikt. Veel journalisten zien verificatie dan ook als de kern van journalistiek werk. Belangrijke redenen voor journalisten om niet aan verificatie te doen, is wanneer zij vinden dat een expert zelf verantwoordelijk is voor diens uitspraken, wanneer zij vertrouwen hebben in een bron, en wanneer informatie niet te verifiëren is. Wanneer journalisten wel aan verificatie doen, doen zij dit door het spreken van meerdere experts voor één productie, door beweringen bij andere experts of bronnen te checken (op achtergrondbasis), door de uitspraken te laten controleren door de geïnterviewde zelf of door de oorspronkelijke bron van een bewering terug te zoeken. De belangrijkste rolopvatting die journalisten voor zichzelf zien, is het bieden van betrouwbare informatie aan het publiek en om deze te voorzien van context en duiding. Journalisten vinden het hebben van een kritische bril bij verslaggeving over het coronavirus extra belangrijk.","['Journalistiek', 'Wetenschapsjournalistiek', 'CoronaVirus']"

Cultural Global Intifada: Contemporary Art House Films about Palestine as a Medium for Broadcasting the Global Intifada,"Basaran, Raziye Rabia",['Dr. Haneen Omari'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The question of the Palestinian and Israeli conflict and the political situation at hand strongly indicates that the existing popular culture is influenced by power and politics. Film as a form of popular culture is also influenced by the wider discourse of world politics and beholds the features of broadcasting certain messages to the audience. Therefore, film is worth studying as a potential medium to convey the struggle of the Palestinian people. This research provides a better understanding of the importance of culture as a political medium in the Palestinian struggle, especially in the global context, given regard to the correlation between politics and culture. More specifically, the research aimed to analyze how contemporary art house films about the Palestinian struggle relate to the new form of the intifada also referred to as the global intifada. The research focused on three art house films from 2013 onwards: Mars At Sunrise, Condom Lead and In Vitro. The analysis was based on how these films relate to the characteristics of the global intifada, such as the cultural, intersectional, decolonial-global and inter/national features through interconnected-joint initiatives. To gain a better understanding of the social relationship between these film productions and the global intifada, the theory of Pierre Bourdieu of the cultural field was applied. The findings suggest that these films, as a cultural medium, visualize the global intifada mainly through cultural practice. Non-traditional film techniques and genres, such as visual effects and fantasy/science fiction, are hereby key factors. Moreover, the statements of the film producers indicate an inter/national, and most importantly global, approach to highlighting the Palestinian struggle in their artworks. Finally, the works relate to the transformational and decolonial character of this intifada, as they challenge the wider public to change their narrative of the Palestinian individual and the Palestinian struggle.","['(Palestinian) Art house films, cultural production, global intifada, cultural intifada, visual effects']"

This was a transformative period for both countries' leftist groups, following the 1967 June War and the 1968 global protests. This was reflected in the Italian approach towards the Middle East and the Palestinian cause, as public opinion and the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) moved from a pro-Israel position to support the Palestinian struggle. I argue that this shift was influenced by the close relationship between the PCI and the LCP, which evolved from preferential contact to a special relationship. The LCP was the PCI’s preferred interlocutor in the region, and as the 1975 Civil War approached the PCI began supporting the Lebanese comrades with first humanitarian and then financial aid. This close relationship in turn provided the PCI with information on regional politics and direct access to the Palestinian groups. By the early 1980s, the Italian position completed the shift in favour of Palestine, and both the PCI and PSI abandoned their traditional pacifism to support an Italian military intervention in Lebanon to stop the Israeli invasion in 1982. I investigate this shift mainly through PCI and PSI archives, which show the increasing contact with Lebanese groups and the growing involvement in the country. Looking at the evolving relationship between the Italian and Lebanese Left, this thesis highlights the transnational nature of the leftist movement and connects Italian and Lebanese local politics to the global context of the Cold War and the Long-Sixties.","['Left', 'Italy', 'Lebanon', 'Long Sixties']"

"Mingei Theory and Ceramics Today: Performance, ‘Nature’ , Artists and Craftspeople","Damen, Maxime",['Doreen Müller'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Japanese Mingei (Folk craft) theory has played a prominent role in the realm of crafts, drawing parallels to the Arts and Crafts movement that emerged in Great Britain during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Mingei, as a counter-movement, aimed to revive traditional crafts in response to the perceived decline of fine arts. Influenced by pioneers of the Arts and Crafts movement, Yanagi Sōetsu (1889-1961) began developing Mingei theory in the early 20th century after exploring Korean crafts. Yanagi's theory centered on appreciating objects crafted by the people (min) and aimed to highlight the significance of these creations. Even today, Mingei continues to be applied to various objects, endowing them with an air of ""authenticity"" and ""naturalness."" Objects classified as Mingei are often perceived as traditional, reflecting regional techniques and shapes. The link to ""nature"" arises from the production process, where craftsmen prefer using locally available materials, operating in a state of mushin (no mind) – a concept derived from Zen Buddhism. According to Yanagi Sōetsu, this non-conscious state enables craftsmen to channel ""nature"" or a higher power, resulting in objects that embody a spiritual connection to the natural world. This research explores the evolution of Mingei theory in the context of Japanese ceramics and its reciprocal influence on ceramicists. Focusing predominantly on Yanagi's original theories, this study investigates how ceramicists have adapted and applied these ideas. Notably, Mingei theory has been instrumental in differentiating Japanese ceramics from non-Japanese works, imbuing them with a sense of ""authenticity"" associated with ""folk art."" While certain elements may not inherently qualify as ""folk,"" they still carry Mingei attributes, reflecting national and possibly essentialist notions. Through comparative analysis, this study examines the work and comments of two prominent figures in Japanese ceramics – Hamada Shōji (1894-1978) and contemporary ceramicist Matsuo Haruka (b. 1974). Hamada Shōji, renowned for his association with Yanagi Sōetsu and the Mingei movement, serves as a compelling case study. His influence on Yanagi and vice versa sheds light on the essence of being a Mingei artist. In contrast, Matsuo Haruka, a ceramicist active in the Netherlands, offers a contemporary perspective, adhering to traditional ""folk"" techniques while receiving formal education in fine arts and textiles. Her experience and familial connections to Yanagi Sōri, Sōetsu's son, present a unique opportunity to explore the intersection of tradition and modernity in Mingei theory. Ultimately, this research aims to illuminate the dynamic relationship between Mingei theory and Japanese ceramics, uncovering the ways in which this influential movement has shaped the world of crafts. By examining the insights of Yanagi Sōetsu, Hamada Shōji, and Matsuo Haruka, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of Mingei's impact on the appreciation of Japanese ceramics and its continued relevance in contemporary artistic practice.","['Ceramics, Japan, Mingei, Diaspora, Art']"

To Learn Three Centuries in Two Years: The Pioneering Japanese Students at Leiden University in the 1860s,"Zhang, Minghao","['Slaman, P. J.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis revisits the Japanese student delegation of 1863, which was sent by the Tokugawa Shogunate to the Netherlands. The thesis concentrates especially on the journey of Nishi Amane and Tsuda Mamichi, who studied Western academic disciplines with Leiden University professor Simon Vissering between 1863 and 1865 and introduced this knowledge to Japan for the first time in history. The thesis revisits the case in Chapter 1 from the perspective centered around Nishi, Tsuda, and Vissering, who were long thought to be the most important characters of this trip. In chapter 2, with the help of previously unmentioned primary sources, the thesis revisits the case from the Dutch perspective, a perspective never taken by previous historians. By analyzing these new sources in a broader context, the thesis discovers numerous new insights. The most important insight was the pivotal role of Johannes Josephus Hoffmann, the professor of Chinese and Japanese studies at Leiden University and the translator of the Netherlands Indies Government, within this study trip. This thesis finds that Hoffmann was essential for this historical event to happen, due to his envisioning actions to persuade both the Japanese and the Dutch decisionmakers to conduct this event in the way they did. In addition, the thesis finds that Hoffmann was the central figure in preparing, receiving, optimizing, and coordinating the trip. Therefore, this thesis argues that the current public and scholarly attention, as well as the historical recognition granted to Hoffmann, are remarkably inadequate.","['Netherlands-Japan', 'Leiden University', 'Simon Vissering', 'Nishi Amane', 'Tsuda Mamichi', 'Rangaku', 'J.

With an art-historical analysis of these works, I demonstrate that the cooperation between Atlas Van Stolk and the Rotterdam Public Library makes them as a whole greater than a sum of its parts. A brief overview of the task that the Rotterdam City Council has set to make Atlas Van Stolk publicly accessible, provides insight into the future aims of the Van Stolk collection. A historical analysis of the origins and collection policy explains the role and function of the collection to serve both historical and public interest: now and in the future. A subsequent analysis of the library as a public space sheds light on its mission and public policy and explains its position to expose heritage to a wide audience. The outline of the history, present, and future substantiates the connection between Atlas Van Stolk and the Rotterdam Public Library to actively pursue social development and education. An art-historical analysis of nineteen newsprints from the time 1500-1815 demonstrates that the combination of entertainment and education in these prints makes newsprints an inherently publicly engaging medium. Theoretical analysis of the intermediality of a selection of prints explains their educational and entertaining function because of the interplay between text and image. The public sphere and the public space come together because the library functions to create a democratic environment that stimulates critical thought, active citizenship, and community participation. The outcomes of the theoretical analysis and the methodology are translated into present-day cultural values of democracy and critical citizenship within the public sphere by means of the exhibition proposal.","['Art History, Print Culture, Public Space, Public Sphere, Satire, Political Prints, Atlas Van Stolk, Rotterdam Public Library, Public Library, Intermediality']"

The first section situates the research gap in the diverse field of landscape thinking, an interdisciplinary field engaging cultural geography, philosophy, art history, media studies and critiques of national thought. In response to John Wylie’s call for concern for ‘homeland thinking’ in landscape studies, it pursues a critical comparison of phenomenological and relational conceptions of ‘embeddedness’ in landscapes alongside the notion of landscape as ‘foundation’ of identity as defined by the European Landscape Convention. The second section of the paper opens up to an in-depth exploration of land and landscapes in the first episode ‘Hunters and Farmers’ of the popular docudrama Het verhaal van Nederland (The Story of the Netherlands). The analysis demonstrates the frequently narrow and exclusionary effect of engaging land and landscapes in national ‘stories’.","['landscape(s), docudrama, Het verhaal van Nederland, embeddedness, national identity']"

Deliberately, the above title refers to ‘temporality’, and not to ‘Time’. Temporality is not a term employed by Hegel in his writings. In a strict sense, what Hegel explicitly refers to as Time is limited to natural Time, and any other sense that might be associated with a temporality beyond natural Time is understood by Hegel as History —not as temporality. In Hegel’s works, Time and History pertain to the different realms of Nature and Spirit. Nevertheless, at the same time, for Hegel Nature and Spirit constitute instances in the unfolding of the Absolute Idea. Far from being a merely pure or abstract form, the Absolute Idea exists and becomes concrete as both realms. Consequently, beyond the letter of Hegelian philosophy, there is a common element to ‘Time’ and ‘History’, in that they both are the existing logical figure of finitude, or of ‘that which has its negation out of itself’ . The central claim of the present essay is that, in Hegel’s philosophy, there is this larger and contradictory logic connecting ‘Time’ and ‘History’ (a paradox of temporality), and that the paradoxical nature of this logic can be explained by an early concept found in the Difference: the notion of absolute identity. Therefore, the following argument will consider two main questions. Firstly: what are the main aspects of the contradiction of temporality in Nature and in Spirit? Secondly: how does Hegel’s early notion of absolute identity account for this paradox of temporality?","['Time', 'temporality', 'eternity', 'infinite', 'nothingness', 'existence', 'absolute identity', 'Absolute Idea', 'Hegel']"

Moving beyond (neo)liberal care ethics, this thesis argues for a non-gendered Confucian care ethics, illustrating what it means to care democratically. The aim is to alter democratic deficits by embracing interrelated Confucian selfhood. This enables intergenerational care to adapt to contemporary social challenges to humanity, democracy, equality, and freedom. I expand the notion of Confucian interrelated selfhood – transforming dichotomous moral boundaries of identity, community, and society – to include non-gendered, non-dyadic relationships. To be relevant for future generations, Confucian care ethical democracy must offer a theory of justice that understands how to care for each other in society. Whilst facing numerous care crises, it is imperative to encourage people to explore what it means to care intergenerationally for the present and future world. A communal effort to flourish on this planet starts by understanding the complexity of raising oneself, each other, and a whole society.","['Care Ethics', 'Confucianism', 'Non-Gender theory', 'Feminism', 'Confucian Care Ethics', 'Global Village', 'Democratic Selfhood', 'Communal Selfhood', 'Non-Dyadic Relationships', 'Intergenerational Care']"

It will contain six chapters with each its own research question. First, I will elaborate on what Nussbaum’s work on animal ethics entails, after which I will go into detail as to why we have sufficient reason to believe that many mysteries on the animal mind have yet to be solved. Nussbaum claims humans have a duty to treat each species according to their wants and needs, but this proofs to be difficult when new aspects of the animal mind are discovered as we speak. The third chapter will contain the main problem with Nussbaum’s theory: she relies too heavily on scientific research about animal consciousness. After I have elaborated on what Carter’s theory on opacity respect entails, I will identify what modifications need to be made in order to apply Carter’s theory onto non-human species. Carter argues that we must look at a creature’s capabilities only at a superficial level; to treat them ‘opaque’ as to avoid unequal treatment. The last chapter will explain why Carter’s theory on opacity respect cannot solve the problem within Nussbaum’s theory, because the core idea of her work will be lost. We will face a difficult dilemma: either we keep Nussbaum’s theory and accept the inconsistency, or reject her theory fully. Other possibilities and further research will be explored additionally.","['Animal Ethics, Opacity Respect, Ian Carter, Knowledge on Animal Consciousness']"

The medium of photography for representing the cloud has not yet been researched. Central to this research is the analysis of the photography of Acid Clouds that photographs datacenter exteriors as a means to map the cloud. By the way in which photography is discursively embedded as both informative and desensitizing, photography of data centers as a form of visualizing the cloud can easily, instead of offering visibility, make the cloud more distractive but omnipresent, as well as reinforce ideas of security and complicity. This paper develops two concepts, ""concealment"" and ""stability,"" that can be used by researchers and artists who want to work with the interplay between the medium of photography, cloud infrastructure, and the cloud.","['data centers', 'photography', 'cloud infrastructure', 'Acid Clouds', 'hypervisibility', 'invisibility']"

By presenting my own argument, I will engage in the debate on whether Japan truly fulfils this role. The research conducted for this thesis draws on case studies and primary and secondary sources to observe that despite facing various obstacles, Japan was able to maintain a liberal approach to its international relations with these countries. This was achieved through the use of soft power, diplomatic efforts, and cooperation in addressing common challenges posed by the pandemic. The thesis argues that liberalism is indeed a useful framework for understanding Japan's relations with these countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.","['COVID-19 pandemic, Liberalism, Japan, Foreign Policy, Asia’s Liberal Leader']"

Assessing the Development of Dockless Shared Electric Mopeds in The Hague,"Barboza, Nicolas",['Dr. Alistair Kefford'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Mobility worldwide is being transformed following the rapid emergence of dockless shared schemes of e-bicycles and e-scooters. Dockless modes give users freedom to park at any location within large geographical boundaries. They are advocated on the premise of sustainability and accessibility, although there is also a for-profit agenda behind operative decision-making processes. Often, these micro-vehicles are competing for space with pedestrians in already overcrowded cities. The Hague, Netherlands, is experiencing poorly parked e-scooters in its coastal area. The aim of this paper is to assess the state-of-art of dockless shared electric mopeds in The Hague. The topic is addressed with a mixed-methods design combining desk research with spatial analysis. Review of municipal and company policy documents indicate conflicting and abstract rules which lack determined spatial parameters. It was found that the dockless model is managed by the geofences drawn by operators, who are making arbitrary decisions over the service coverage areas. Furthermore, the spatial analysis of two dockless shared electric moped operators, Check and Felyx, indicates that sharply different approaches are taken in the mapping of geofences. Based on these results, technological and policy recommendations include that mutual agreements are needed among operators for advancing the geofencing system, and that the state should demand clear rules from providers regarding the parking of e-mopeds, as well as the functions of geographical boundaries drawn. This paper concludes that functionality of dockless micromobility varies among operators as they possess differing GPS systems, definition of geofence types, and stated rules.","['Dockless, Geofences, Micromobility, Shared e-Mopeds, The Hague']"
British support for the Saudi military operations in the Yemen War: why does this alliance continue?,"Bie, Anne de","['Shaev, B.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In order to identify why the British government continues their support for the Saudi military operations in the Yemen War, this research focuses on three major British policy areas: (geo)politics, security, and economics. British geopolitical interests in backing the Saudi military operations in Yemen focus on expanding their own regional influence in the Middle East. British relations with Iran influences the British strategy towards the Yemen War, as this was is perceived to be a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, in which the UK engages in substitution warfare to counteract the enlargement of the Iranian sphere of influence. Further security interest of the UK to continue their support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen is to counteract the terrorist presence of the AQAP in Yemen, which fits into a wider trend of British counterterrorism policy. Furthermore, British arms sales to the Saudi army play a role in British security as well as economic interests in the Yemen War. The contested British arms sales to Saudi are continued both to strengthen the Saudi military power and to benefit from the lucrative military arms market. Lastly, this research discusses the influence of the oil market on the British determination to continue their support for Saudi Arabia in the Yemen War, relating to energy security facilitated by Saudi oil.","['Yemen War', 'UK-Saudi relations', 'geopolitics', 'security', 'oil', 'proxy war', 'substitution warfare', 'UK-Iran relations', 'British arms sales', 'British foreign policy in Middle East', 'counterterrorism']"

"A Critical Consideration of the Representation of Women in Ukiyo-e: Celebration, Aesthetic and Objectification","Roelofs, Bente","['Müller, D.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"'Ukiyo' was both a state of mind and a world of pleasure-seeking. It offered freedom from the limitations placed by the Tokugawa shogunate. It also gave the merchant class, and urban life in general, a break from the controlling samurai warrior class. Edo (present-day Tokyo) society was generally regarded as a highly controlled society. Not unexpectedly, the Edo, Kyoto, and Osaka pleasure districts were likewise restricted. The most well-known of them was the Yoshiwara licensed brothel district, a separate walled town to the north of the main city that was exclusively created to entertain its male inhabitants. While ukiyo-e like paintings, prints, and illustrated books portrayed nearly every element of coeval Japanese society in Edo, pictures of female entertainers and pleasure districts in Yoshiwara were the most prevalent. A large selection of these portrayed women, although perhaps unintentionally by the artist because of the different social roles women had back then, are depicted in an objectifying manner. This is especially the case in bijinga, literally translated as ‘images of beautiful women’. The women, although it is debatable whether the depicted women are supposed to represent the actual women from the Edo period or if they are merely icons, are put down as objects of desire and vessels for reproduction among other things. In this paper, I will shed light on this issue and question whether ‘celebration’ or ‘aesthetic’ are used as a justification for these forms of objectification or not. Using ambiguous prints, I will give an analysis of the different perspectives and explanations that exist about that specific print.","['art history', 'utamaro', 'bijinga', 'bijin', 'objectification', 'women', 'ukiyo', 'floating world', 'celebration', 'aesthetic']"

Extraverts and introverts: The influence of personality traits on speech production,"Croonen, Rens",['Niels Schiller'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research paper investigated the influence of introversion and extraversion on speech production. Psychological studies showed differences in human behaviour between extraverts and introverts (e.g. in social interaction and in being talkative). The field of linguistics focused more on the use of language, and found differences between the two personality traits on, among others, speech production and second language acquisition. However, in-depth research on the differences between extraverts and introverts in making speech errors during speech production was missing. Therefore, this study was carried out to answer the following research question: ‘To what extent differ extraverts and introverts in the amount of speech errors they make during speech production?’. To examine this research question, the following method was used. Forty-four participants were recruited and divided into 22 extravert participants and 22 introvert participants, based on the Quest-questionnaire. The SLIP paradigm was used to elicit and investigate the amount of speech errors the two groups made. Speech errors were analysed in terms of spoonerisms, non-responses, miscellaneous errors and other false responses. Significant results were found between the two groups, resulting in the claim that introverts make more speech errors during speech production on population level. However, further research on this topic is still needed.","['Extraverts, introverts, personality traits, speech production, speech errors']"

External Factors on Language Learning: How do Dutch L2 Speakers of English Experience External Influences while Learning English?,"Klijn, Calvin","['Jeffery, J.V.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Language learning has been a widely researched topic for many years. Most research that has been done on language learning focuses on the impact of external factors on language proficiency. However, no research has been done on the personal experiences of language learners and how these learners perceived these influences during this process. Therefore, this thesis researched the perceived impact of external influences on learners of English in the Netherlands, focusing on the perceived influences of education, engagement with media and participants’ own added perceived influences. This information can be helpful for educators and learners alike. The perceived impact of external influences was investigated with a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews using deductive and inductive coding. This study recruited recently graduated participants (1-4 years post-graduation) with different educational tracks. The interviews showed that Dutch participants with English as their second language (L2) perceived primary education to be of no influence because the participants received so little training during their primary education. Secondary education was perceived as incredibly helpful; additionally, it was perceived as rather boring. The influence of tertiary education depended on the subject of the degree rather than the participants' education level. Media engagement was perceived as a helpful tool that could add extra context and input to the training received during education. Negative influences of engaging with media pertained to content being generally addictive and desensitising to the real world. Media was also perceived as untrustworthy concerning the correctness of the language that is produced online. The oral proficiency of the 3 participants was also investigated by deductive coding of the transcripts using Communication Strategies (CS. These results were compared with the self-reports on their speaking abilities. This revealed that participants had a surprisingly accurate view of their speaking skills.","['Language Learning', 'External Factors', 'Thematic Analysis', 'Communication Strategies', 'Self-Report', 'Interview']"

Pit or phit? The production of English aspirated stops by speakers of Dutch,"Broek, Merel van den","['Caspers, J.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines whether native speakers of Dutch can aspirate unvoiced word-initial plosives in English as a second language and if they are able to do so to the same degree as native speakers of English. Aspiration was measured in word-initial unvoiced plosives /p, t, k/ using Voice Onset Time (VOT). Influence of sex, age, age of onset of the second language, and self-reported general pronunciation ability in English were also examined. Native Dutch VOT generally lies between 0-20ms, while native English VOT is anywhere between 50-100 ms. Using recordings from 19 participants who read both Dutch and English sentences out loud, it was found that participants increased their aspiration with an average of 10 ms when switching from Dutch to English. The analysis also shows that two participants out of 19 had an average VOT at a native-like level (>50 ms). Further investigation showed that sex, age, and age of onset did not influence VOT. Participants who graded their general pronunciation abilities with an 8 or higher did show a bigger increase in VOT, but there was no correlation to higher VOT in English when compared to other speakers. Other results showed that /p, t, k/ were not aspirated to the same extent, with /t/ being aspirated significantly more and /p/ significantly less. Lastly, the co-existence of words in both English and Dutch did not significantly alter the VOT, only when words started with /k/ did aspiration significantly improve when the exact word also existed in Dutch. These results conclude that native speakers of Dutch increase aspiration and can aspirate to a native-like degree while speaking English. Any defining factors of the participants who were able to do so are not available due to the limited sample size.","['Aspiration', 'Dutch', 'English', 'Voice Onset Time (VOT)', 'Cross-Linguistic Phonetic Interaction (CLI)', 'plosives', 'Second Language Acquisition (SLA)', 'pronunciation']"
Emails from Transylvania – Immersion in Bram Stoker’s Dracula through the Online Serialized Publication Dracula Daily,"Arbouw, Amber",['Dr. R.A.

The temporal spread of the Dracula Daily publication has made it possible for its readers to form an emotional connection to the various characters in the text, which has resulted in a deepened sense of immersion. Dracula Daily has taken advantage of contemporary readership habits by providing readers with serialized short-form fragments of the novel Dracula, which have resulted in the popularity of the publication. The online Dracula Daily community has led to the readers’ increased interaction with the novel. For the readers of the Dracula Daily publication, this has led to a deeper sense of immersion in the novel Dracula. The findings of this thesis suggest that publishers of classical literary works could benefit from utilizing online serialized publication as a means to deepen the readers’ immersion in the text.","['Dracula', 'immersion', 'serialized online publication', 'contemporary reading habits']"

The gender congruency effect in Dutch noun phrase and bare noun production: evidence from behavioral and electrophysiological data,"Hinsberg, Myrte van","['Schiller, N.O.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"While multiple models of language production exist, it remains difficult to find conclusive evidence for one or the other model. The present study is one of the first to incorporate both behavioral data and EEG data in a native Dutch noun phrase production task to investigate the processing of grammatical gender. We used a picture-word interference paradigm in which speakers had to name a picture while being distracted by a superimposed word. The distractors were manipulated for grammatical gender congruency with and semantic relatedness to the picture names. In separate blocks, participants had to produce either bare nouns, or determiner noun constructions. We found a robust effect of the semantic relatedness effect in the behavioral data, in which targets belonging to the same semantic category as the distractor were named significantly later than unrelated targets. The EEG data on the semantic relatedness effect were less clear, possibly due to opposing ERP components in (partly) overlapping time windows. More importantly, we replicated the gender congruency effect in reaction times, showing that naming latencies were longer for gender-incongruent trials than for congruent trials. This behavioral effect disappeared in bare noun naming. The EEG data showed similar results, in which a more positive peak was found between 385-585 milliseconds for incongruent than for congruent trials, again only in the determiner noun block. The result seems to indicate a P300 effect rather than the expected enhanced N400, suggesting higher conflict resolution processes for incongruent trials. The absence of the gender effect in bare noun naming in both data types suggests that grammatical gender is not automatically accessed or selected in Dutch noun (phrase) production. This in turn has implications for speech production models.","['gender congruency effect', 'grammatical gender', 'Dutch', 'picture-word interference paradigm', 'EEG', 'semantic relatedness effect', 'N400', 'P300']"
"Female Agency in the Gulf: Show, but Don’t Ask","Verhagen, Nordin","['Ennis, C. A.', 'Theunissen, H.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since the first oil-boom of the 1970s, the Arab Gulf countries have witnessed rapid socio-economic developments as a result of expansive oil-revenues. These rapid socioeconomic developments were multifaceted, but in a region known for its social conservatism, it is interesting to explore the evolution of the position of women amid socio-economic changes. The expression of female agency offers numerous possibilities to explore this evolution in Arab-Gulf societies from a woman’s perspective, but it also offers challenges to Western academics as contemporary literature on female agency in the Arab Gulf is limited. In this thesis, I present a case study of the social media accounts of six Arab-Gulf women with a relatively large social media following. Research has been conducted into their social media posts to explain a changing attitude in female agency in the Arab Gulf, in terms of clothing, self-expression and positioning in their society. As all six women are part of the wealthier echelons of their society, it is interesting to observe that there is little cohesion in their posts to changing societal progress in terms of women’s rights. While the women seem to acknowledge societal change through their posts, none of them used their relatively large social media following to explicitly call out leaders to demand rights or to express gratitude for obtained rights. This research highlights the need for further exploration into the expression of female agency through the use of social media in a digitalizing world.","['Female agency', 'social change', 'Gulf States', 'social media']"

Een reflectie van een nieuwe vrouw: Het vrouwenbeeld in de negentiende-eeuwse posterkunst,"Dauvillier, Eden",['Helen Westgeest'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit essay wordt het vrouwenbeeld in Franse posters uit de negentiende eeuw onderzocht. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te kijken in hoeverre het beeld van de new woman en de verleidelijke vrouw in de commerciële poster contrasterende beelden zijn. Door middel van interdisciplinair onderzoek waarbij er gebruik werd gemaakt van genderstudies, zijn verschillende vrouwentypen in negentiende-eeuwse posterkunst worden geanalyseerd. Uit deze analyse blijkt dat er opvallende overeenkomsten zijn tussen verleidelijke vrouwentypen en ‘progressieve’ vrouwentypen als de new woman. Het commerciële aspect van de posterkunst zorgt ervoor dat de verleidelijkheid altijd aanwezig is, maar dat dit niet betekent dat de vrouw in de poster geen intellectualiteit kan uitstralen. Daarnaast blijkt uit het onderzoek naar het nieuwe toeschouwerschap van het medium dat de poster een nieuw soort toeschouwer aantrok, waar ook vrouwen bij hoorden. De verschillende vrouwentypen in de posterkunst van de late negentiende eeuw blijken allemaal reflecties te zijn op veranderende genderrollen in de samenleving.","['Genderstudies', 'New Woman', 'Posterkunst', 'Toeschouwerschap', 'Vrouwenbeeld']"

"An Analysis of Offensive Language, Taboo Language and Characterisation in the First Season of Netflix’s Sex Education","Drijgers, Mees","['Dorst, A.G.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"As offensive and taboo language is becoming increasingly common in day-to-day life, this type of language has also become a part of our entertainment media, including in subtitles. Offensive and taboo language can be used for many different reasons and to create many different effects in the source text. This means that offensive and taboo language can also be used for a character’s characterisation, meaning it will be a way for them to express their own personality, their intent, or to form a relationship with the people around them. However, subtitlers often deal with spatio-temporal constraints that will not allow them to retain every single instance of offensive and taboo language in the target text. This means offensive and taboo language is often the first to be omitted, and this could potentially negatively affect the characterisation of certain characters. This study is an analysis of the offensive and taboo language in the first season of Netflix’s Sex Education and the characterisation of four characters in the English and Dutch subtitles. Ávila-Cabrera’s (2016) taxonomy of offensive and taboo language was used to categorise the offensive and taboo language that was found in the target text. Pinker’s (2007) and Dynel’s (2012) typologies of function were used to classify the functions of the offensive and taboo language. Lastly, a combination of Vinay & Darbelnet’s (2000) and Díaz Cintas & Remael’s (2007) translation strategies were used. The results show that, even though all four characters had parts of their offensive or taboo language omitted during the translation process, their characterisation was not negatively affected. This entails that the Dutch subtitles did not portray an entirely different personality compared to the English source text.","['offensive language', 'taboo language', 'taboo words', 'swear words', 'subtitling', 'Sex Education', 'English', 'Dutch']"

The study used transcriptions to obtain frequency and syntactic constructions and interviews with speakers of Acehnese to obtain social functions and perceived attitudes toward CS. It was found that the use of Acehnese relative to Indonesian and other languages in the parliamentary was 26.5% in terms of word count and 3.3% in terms of continuous speech duration and furthermore could be classified as CS wherein Acehnese served either as Matrix and Embedded Language based on Matrix Language Framework (MLF – Myers-Scotton and Jake, 2009). The CS were mostly intersentential in both direction and extrasentential CS were found only from Indonesian to Acehnese. In addition, the CS mainly functioned as a manner of quotation and interlocutor addressing.

A seminal study by Kovács and Mehler (2009) provided evidence that there is a bilingual advantage in 7-month-old pre-verbal infants in a switching task, although replication findings are inconsistent (Dal Ben et al., 2022; D’Souza et al., 2020; Kalashnikova et al., 2021; Spit et al., 2023). Measuring the pupil dilation response (PDR), a physiological measurement linked to the locus coeruleus (LC) and as such, to cognitive processing load, could give us a more direct look into whether 7-month-old bilingual infants indeed have a cognitive advantage compared to monolinguals. For this pilot study, additional pupil size measurements were taken in the Leiden arm of the replication effort of Spit et al. (2023) to examine whether bilinguals have a smaller PDR from baseline. After hearing a syllable pattern (AAB or ABB) the infants had to predict on which side a visual reward appeared. The reward side would be the same for the first nine trials in the pre-switch block. The next nine trials had the other syllable pattern and the reward on the other side in the post-switch block. Finally, the last 18 trials mixed both syllable patterns, retaining their associated reward side. The results suggest no difference in cognitive load between the monolingual and bilingual groups when they needed to relearn to predict the target reward side in the post-switch block, nor was there a difference in mean PDR in the association block. This is in line with the results found in Spit et al. (2023) where anticipatory looking behaviour was examined. However, an exploratory analysis suggested there was a significantly larger PDR in monolinguals during stimulus presentation in the pre-switch block compared to the post-switch block, indicating monolinguals had a higher processing load in the first block of the experiment. The implications of this are unclear, but might be explained by an effect related to the unfamiliarity of the task stimuli seen in monolinguals only due to different attentional strategies between the groups. Future research should be done with larger sample sizes and more sophisticated statistical modelling.","['bilingualism', 'pupillometry', 'bilingual advantage', 'infants', 'cognitive processing load', 'inhibitory control']"

Raging about Climate Breakdown: On the Justifiability of Violent Protest and Property Damage,"Koning, Paulien","['Fossen, Thomas']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the justifiability of violent climate disobedience, specifically focusing on the inclusion of property damage as a symbolic element of the wider climate movement. By analysing the urgency and severity of the climate crisis, the research argues that limited and targeted property damage can serve as a catalyst for public debate and draw attention to the pressing need for immediate action. The research explores the ethical and strategic implications of different protest tactics, challenging negative perceptions and providing a clearer understanding of the moral boundaries surrounding climate activism. It highlights the need for more radical tactics in cases where nonviolent methods have been ignored by authorities. The implications of this research are challenging existing discourse and providing a framework for assessing the legitimacy and acceptability of property damage within the climate movement. However, the thesis acknowledges the need to consider the personal costs and consequences for protestors engaging in violent protest, as well as the broader impacts on their well-being and the regenerative culture of the climate movement. Future research should address these limitations and explore philosophical and legal perspectives to further understand the moral complexities and legal considerations associated with violent climate protest. By undertaking these lines of research, a comprehensive understanding of the ethical, legal, and practical dimensions of violent climate disobedience can be achieved, contributing to informed discussions and decision-making processes for activists, policymakers, and society at large.","['climate activism', 'climate breakdown', 'civil disobedience', 'uncivil disobedience', 'property damage', 'fairness of costs', 'futility', 'self-defence', 'non-violence']"

Through interviewing visitors of the Nxt Museum, Amsterdam, this thesis investigates the ways in which persons engage with and are present in front of the hypermediated installation art in the exhibition Unidentified Fluid Other (June 2022–September 2023). The immersive and spatial qualities of the installations retain an enticing quality that are a popular photographic motif for visitors and designate the institution as a heterotopic environment. Moreover, the installations possess an alluring aesthetics of hypermediation that provokes profound, embodied and affective sensations in their viewers. Instagram usage and smartphone photography hereby significantly reshape and restructure visitors’ attention and behavior in the gallery space, resulting in a remediation of their embodied experiences via the hand-held device that oscillates between a desire for immediacy and profuse hypermediation. In renegotiating their sense of presence and sense of selves in the art experience, visitors resort to a dual engagement with the installations whereby they actively experience the art with and without their phones. This research therefore identifies smartphone photography as an additional trajectory in the contemporary museum experience, as an extension of the visitors’ selves. The effects of smartphone remediation on embodied affectivity and presence of visitors in art spaces thus retain beneficial qualities which may inform cultural institutions and art historical research at large.","['smartphone remediation', 'new media art installation', 'museum visitor experience', 'affective presence']"

A Look into Singapore's Multiculturalist Society: how do Recognition and Redistribution Function as a Cornerstone for Multiculturalism?,"Leeuw, Fabiènne de","['Li, J.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Filosofie (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"As multiculturalism is becoming the norm for countries and cities in the 21st century, it becomes more important every day to create harmonious, peaceful societies in which multiculturalism can thrive. However, multiculturalist societies will face the following problem: will they prioritize the recognition of several identities? Or focus on economic redistribution for all identities, placing them all on an equal level. The problem becomes that of either assimilating all identities in a large one, or rather emphasizing the differences and varieties between the identities. This thesis will make a case study by looking at how Singapore has tackled this Recognition-Redistribution-dilemma and how it has emerged successful. Singapore itself is a large multiculturalist society that in spite of a complicated colonial past, which led to a varying ethnic population that has seen its fair share of conflict, has been able to maintain both a peaceful society and several identities. How has Singapore achieved this, and how might future multiculturalist societies learn from this example?","['Multiculturalism, Globalisation, Singapore, Citizenship']"

The most crucial organisation that set this in motion, K-pop Stans 4 Leni, created a community to talk politics, campaign for Robredo, and spread truthful information concerning the election. Through interviewing a member of this organisation and circulating a survey, this research aims to research how and why Filipino K-pop fans used K-pop as a tool for their political expression and activism during the 2022 Philippine presidential election and, therefore, how K-pop can be political. Results show that the participants in the organisation are politically active in character. The organisation became a political force using K-pop mechanisms to mobilise many fans swiftly. This research concludes that the organisation used K-pop since it effectively mobilises a large demographic who support their goals. Furthermore, this thesis concludes that K-pop fandom can be political, as shown by KS4GG. However, it cannot be concluded that all aspects of K-pop are political due to a lack of political participation. As this research primarily analyses participants involved with the organisation K-pop Stans 4 Leni, this should be noted as a limitation and allows for further research to be done.","['Activism', 'Fandom', 'Glocalisation', 'K-pop', 'Soft Power']"
Extraordinary influence of ASD portrayals: how the ASD portrayal in the K-drama Extraordinary Attorney Woo affects public perceptions in South Korea,"Mulder, Jolijn","['Jang, S.Y.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Koreastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores the influence of the portrayal of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the K-drama Extraordinary Attorney Woo on public perception and attitudes toward ASD in South Korean society. The study begins by examining the ASD portrayal in Extraordinary Attorney Woo, aiming to comprehend its positioning and characteristics in relation to general criticisms of ASD portrayals. Subsequently, interview videos featuring Korean individuals with ASD are analyzed to identify similarities and differences between their lived experiences and the drama's portrayal. An online survey is then conducted among South Koreans to investigate the impact of the ASD portrayal in Extraordinary Attorney Woo on public perceptions and attitudes toward individuals with ASD. The findings reveal that the drama presents an authentic character with ASD, fostering understanding and awareness of ASD as a spectrum disorder. However, certain aspects of the portrayal, such as romantic relationships and savant skills, do not accurately reflect the realities of individuals with ASD. Nonetheless, the portrayal of ASD in Extraordinary Attorney Woo positively influences public perception and promotes improved understanding and knowledge of ASD in South Korean society.","['autism spectrum disorder', 'K-drama', 'autism portrayal', 'public perception', 'South Korean society']"

The research considers the significance of cultural preservation and audience comprehension to determine the best-fitting translation technique to achieve a good balance between the two. Four main groups of viewers are identified along with their level of familiarity and interest in Korean culture and language, with the majority valuing the preservation of culture. The study analyses frequently used translation techniques and shows that there is a tendency to favour target-oriented techniques, resulting in the loss of most of the culture-specific items. A case study on the drama Squid Game reveals how target-oriented techniques often fall short in preserving culture-specific items. The paper finds that it is best to use a balanced approach between cultural preservation and audience comprehension, avoiding the usage of omission, utilizing source-oriented techniques when possible, and supplementing with translator notes for accents and dialects. This balance will ensure that subtitles accurately convey the intended meaning of the dialogue with their cultural nuances whilst simultaneously ensuring audience comprehension.","['Translation, culture-specific items, cultural preservation, audience comprehension, subtitles, Korean drama, Squid Game']"

Since then no restoration movement has emerged. Restoration movements are an understudied phenomenon and no overarching theoretical framework exists via which their relative strength can be explained. This thesis investigates the reasons behind the lack of an existence of a restoration movement for the Mohammed Ali-dynasty. It does so via a partial application of Grounded theory, which enables the emergence of an explanatory theory via continuous analysis and the use of a wide array of sources. Through a thorough analysis of the existing academic literature concerning the Mohammed Ali-dynasty, Post-revolutionary Egyptian politics an extensive overview is provided of all known restoration sentiments concerning the Mohammed Ali-dynasty. This overview is expanded by analyzing previously unused sources, such as the Dutch national archives, and via an investigation of the political actions of several prominent members of the dynasty. This detailed description of restoration sentiments enables a comparison with the restoration movements for the Bourbons, Senussis and Pahlavis. This comparison finds several crucial factors which are not present in the case of the Mohammed Ali-dynasty and therefore help explain the lack of a restoration movement for this dynasty. In doing this this thesis also provides an initial outline for a broader theoretical framework concerning restoration movements.",

Paskaleva'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study explores the historical transformation and contemporary perception of the Taoyuan Shrine in Taiwan, shedding light on the complex interplay between heritage preservation and visitor experience. Beginning with the Dutch conquest in 1624, Taiwan's colonial history has been shaped by foreign powers, with Japanese rule (1895-1945) leaving a lasting impact. Amidst the transition from Shinto Shrines to Martyrs' Shrines under the martial regime of the Kuomintang (1949-1987), the Taoyuan Shrine stands as an exception, touted for retaining its original appearance. However, questions arise regarding the authenticity of this preservation effort, particularly within the context of a Cultural Park offering commodified experiences. Examining the intertwined notions of heritage preservation and visitor perception, this study seeks to address the question: To what extent does the Taoyuan Shrine remain authentic in the aftermath of structural changes and how is this authenticity perceived by contemporary visitors? This investigation spans two distinct research areas – an exploration of built environment authenticity through qualitative analysis and fieldwork, and an examination of visitor perceptions via a survey informed by key academic discussions. By delving into these dimensions, this study contributes to heritage studies and the discourse on authenticity.","['Japanese Architecture', 'Taiwan', ""Martyrs' Shrine"", 'Shinto', 'Taoyuan', 'Colonial Heritage']"

The Neoliberal Food Regime: A Cause or Solution to the MENA’s Food Crisis?,"Boomgaard, Dante","['Englert, S.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The pressing water shortages, extreme population growth, and high food dependency rates lie at the roots of the contemporary food crisis in the MENA region. These circumstances will exaggerate in the near future, leading to even more challenges in guaranteeing food security. There is an ongoing academic debate on whether the region should focus on the international food market or strive for food self-sufficiency. According to some, the former lies at the roots of the food crisis, while the latter is challenging because of climate issues. To contribute to this debate, this thesis critically examines the coming about of the food crisis based on food regime theory. It takes Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt as case studies to reflect on the agricultural policy in the MENA region from the colonial period onwards. There is a large focus on the neoliberal food regime, being the current global system of food production, consumption, and distribution that can be characterised by 1) a liberalised agricultural market, 2) a centralisation of power and wealth through large agribusiness from the Global North, 3) a focus on the export market and 4) the significant role of International Financial Institutions like the WB and the IMF. This thesis expounds on the contemporary food crisis in the MENA region, both in socio-economic and ecological terms, and explores the relationship between the neoliberal food regime and these issues. As for prospects, it suggests combining food self-sufficiency with the global market, striving for a fair and sustainable global food system that takes into account the contemporary context, its historical background, economic and collaboration opportunities and ecological restrictions. This entails a critical reflection on the role of the persisting Global North in the contemporary food regime and the global food crisis.","['food regime theory', 'food crisis', 'neoliberalism', 'MENA region']"

Malaysia is known as a multi-ethnic and culturally diverse nation. However, this public identity is in contrast with the political reality of Malaysia. This multi-ethnicity comes paired with ethnic segregation, where political parties only represent their ‘own’ ethnicity and their ‘own’ people. Though the ethnic Malay community is the most privileged in the country, politicians spread the idea that the ethnic Malays are under a constant threat of marginalization by ethnic minorities. To take this a step further, the privileged position of the ethnic Malay community is protected through the Constitution, resulting in the exclusion of ethnic minorities from political and public spheres. Advocating for ethnic equality and inclusive politics is considered to be going against the Constitution and is taken as a direct attempt at subordinating the Malay community. This has resulted in far-right sentiments surrounding the position of the Malay community vis-àvis the ethnic minorities. In this context, this paper analyses how institutionalized practices of ethnic segregation in Malaysia have created an environment of right-wing extremism.","['Ethnic segregation', 'Identity politics', 'Right-wing extremism', 'Nationalism', 'Ethnicity', 'Religion', 'Identity']"

The sitcom, following the lives of a group of teenagers living in Derry in the 1990’s, combines the grimness of the sectarian conflict with the recognisability of teenage hardship. In the series, trauma is inherently linked to the everyday concepts of youth, humour, and community. These concepts are used to allow the characters and the audience to think critically on the events occurring in the series, as the conflict is presented with such normalcy. Additionally, they highlight a sense of hope and kinship and advocate for a youth-inclusive approach to peacebuilding. The series can also be seen as a product of its time; not only does it portray the zeitgeist of 1990’s Derry, it is also a response to the ongoing violence and paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland since the Good Friday Agreement. Derry Girls underlines the importance of community in the processing of trauma, established the ‘Derry Girls’ as an exemplification of peacebuilding, and uses humour as a means of the demystification of conflict.","['Derry Girls', 'Trauma', 'Northern Ireland', 'The Troubles', 'Youth']"

The Racialised ‘Other’: Postcolonial ‘black’ migrants in Dutch and British parliamentary debates 1950-1975,"Gohar Elanany, Marwa","['Shield, A.D.J']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The post-WWII period in the Netherlands can be described as a period of great change in Dutch society. Postcolonial migrants from the eastern and western (former) colonies started to immigrate to the Netherlands, changing the racial fabric of the Dutch society. This thesis is a product of researching the Dutch parliamentary debates on postcolonial ‘black’ migrants between 1950 and 1975. The attitudes and use of language in these Dutch debates is then compared to an influential parliamentary debate in the UK in the late 1950s. Central to this comparison is the difference in explicit and implicit references to race by Dutch and British politicians. The study of these debates serves to answer this thesis’ research question: how do parliamentary debates on postcolonial immigration in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom compare and contrast with regard to the ways race and identity factor into these debates between 1950-1975? This thesis attempts to make a contribution to the current debates on the relation between race, postcolonial migration and identity in the political discourse, discussed in the first chapter. Processes of ‘othering’, that are racially conceptualised as a consequence of the effect of the colonial legacy, are being discussed in chapter two to four.",['Postcolonial black migration to Europe']
"Site Specificity and NFTs: The case of Refik Anadol ""Machine Hallucination - Nature Dreams 2021","Zanon, Alessia",['Dr. K. De Wild'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"NFTs, after the recent boom in 2021, are increasingly exiting the online-only realm and are entering the physical space as museums and galleries are increasingly acquiring, displaying and commissioning NFTs artworks. Some of these NFTs are created precisely for a physical space and can be defined as site-specific NFTs. In particular, the digital media artist Refik Anadol (b.1985 Istanbul, Turkey) is a pioneer in creating site-specific NFTs for some of the most important art institutions in the world. The merging between NFTs and Site Specific art has never been discussed previously, and generally the literature on curating NFTs is still lacking. The aim of this paper is to find the tools to analyse a site specific NFTs artwork. To achieve this, Refik Anadol’s artwork Machine Hallucinations – Nature Dreams : AI Data Sculpture 2021 1/1, which was made site-specifically for König Galerie in Berlin, will be studied. The outcome of this research will serve as a tool that could be used to analyse other NFTs site specific works and eventually will be helpful for future re-locations of the artwork.",['NFT – NFT Art – Site-Specificity – Refik Anadol – Digital Art']

Door te kijken naar een grote hoeveelheid archiefmateriaal (vergadernotulen, briefpost, nota's, moties, periodieke uitgaves) van een viertal zeer diverse organisaties kan bepaald worden welke tactieken een significante rol speelden in het uitoefenen van invloed op de Nederlandse overheid. Deze scriptie bouwt daarmee voort op Vosters' onderzoek naar de invloed van NGO's. Dit onderzoek toont aan dat in eerste instantie organisaties met een directe lijn tot de overheid meer invloed konden uitoefenen dan organisaties die een outsider status hadden en zich in een formeel isolement bevonden. Deze insider organisaties beriepen zich hierbij vaak op hun expertise over het onderwerp en hun logistieke autoriteit, waardoor de overheid taken naar hen overhevelde en er een wederzijdse afhankelijke relatie ontstond. Outsider organisaties konden echter extremere eisen stellen, waarbij ze ook meer gegenderde emotionele en morele claims maakten. Hoewel de overheid hier niet responsief voor was, namen de insider organisaties deze eisen en tactieken over tijd over, waardoor outsider organisaties indirect toch nog hun invloed deden gelden. Dit problematiseert de strikte scheidslijn tussen insider en outsider en laat zien dat organisaties met extremere eisen zonder formele toegang tot de overheid toch zeer invloedrijk kunnen zijn.","['Migratiegeschiedenis', 'Repatrianten', 'Spijtoptanten', 'NGO', 'Indonesië', 'Postkoloniale migratie', 'CCKP', 'NASSI', 'Pro Patria']"

Een dubbele handicap: De emancipatie van vrouwen met een handicap in de jaren negentig,"Wall, Fenna Van der","['Van Trigt, P.W.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze scriptie onderzoekt de emancipatie van gehandicapte vrouwen in de jaren negentig van de vorige eeuw. Vanwege een intersectionele positie hadden gehandicapte vrouwen andere ervaringen dan gehandicapte mannen. Als gevolg van sociale vooroordelen, beeldvorming en een laag verwachtingspatroon ervoeren gehandicapte vrouwen een dubbele achterstandspositie die van grote invloed was op hun leven. Deze scriptie heeft de volgende vraag centraal gesteld: Waarom bleken de jaren negentig belangrijk voor de emancipatie en aandacht voor de ervaringen van gehandicapte vrouwen? Na een uiteenzetting van de intersectionele positie van vrouwen met een handicap in de jaren negentig is er onderzoek gedaan in verschillende primaire bronnen, waaruit is gebleken dat deze groep meer aandacht ontving in de jaren negentig door bijvoorbeeld de politiek en belangenorganisaties als de Gehandicaptenraad. Vervolgens zijn er verschillende ontwikkelingen aangewezen die ervoor zorgden dat juist in de jaren negentig deze stappen in de emancipatie gezet konden worden. Hier hadden bijvoorbeeld de theorieën van de feminist disability studies en het sociale model invloed, maar ook ontwikkelingen in de samenleving, politiek en de vrouwenbeweging van de jaren negentig. Met deze scriptie is bovendien de golvenmetafoor van de feministische historiografie ontkracht, door aan te tonen dat ook buiten deze feministische golven er heel belangrijke stappen gezet werden.","['Intersectionaliteit', 'vrouwengeschiedenis', 'handicap', 'sociale geschiedenis: feminist disability studies']"

"The Needle and the Damage Done: The relation between migration, structural marginalization, and drug addiction in the eyes of Dutch parliament: Surinamese and Moluccan immigrant communities and heroin addiction in the Netherlands in the 1970s and 1980s","Tahitu, Ruana Anine",['P. W. van Trigt'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Approximately fifty years ago, the Netherlands was plagued by a heroin endemic. From 1970 to 1980, there were approximately 30,000 heroin users in the Netherlands. Besides ‘native’ Dutch users, two minority immigrant communities quickly fell victim to the substance. Surinamese and Moluccan youngsters had a heroin addiction rate which was ten to twenty percent higher than that of the Dutch native youth. According to a calculation by the Surinamese institution Srefidensi, there were about 2,400 Surinamese heroin users in the Netherlands in 1974. Moluccan institution Tjandu estimated 1,000 Moluccan heroin users in the Netherlands in 1978. Considering the noticeably higher rate of heroin addiction amongst the Surinamese and Moluccan minorities, one starts to wonder about the possible triggers. More recently, there has been an increase in research on migrants and drug addiction. This thesis aims to combine contemporary literature on migration and (drug)addiction, a historical understanding of the Surinamese and Moluccan migration to the Netherlands and post-migratory experiences, with an in-dept analysis of parlimentary documents to answer the research question: How did the Dutch parliament perceive Surinamese and Moluccan heroin addiction and addiction care from 1975 to 1982?",

It inquires whether Simmons' philosophical anarchism implies political anarchism— involving a duty to oppose and undermine the state. The thesis critically examines Simmons' arguments and counterarguments against critics Joseph Wellman and Thomas Senor, who assert that Simmons' position results in justified disobedience and a moral duty to resist the state. By viewing the moral implications of state illegitimacy within Simmons' 'balance-of-reasons' approach, this thesis contends that Simmons fails to defend his framework against implying political anarchism. Additionally, it proposes the concept of an 'adaptive duty to oppose and undermine the state,' a nuanced approach in response to non-consensual state coercion that acknowledges moral concerns while striving for peaceful yet effective political reform.","['Anarchism', 'Philosophical Anarchism', 'Political Anarchism', 'John Simmons', 'Political Obligation', 'State Illegitimacy', 'State Authority', 'Adaptive Duty', 'Non-consensual Coercion']"

Het onderzoek omvat een analyse van de consensus tussen de politieke partijen die zich ontwikkelde tussen 1945 en 1967. Er wordt specifiek gekeken naar de voortzetting en reconstructie van deze consensus na de Suez-crisis van 1956, in relatie tot het koloniale en defensiebeleid ten aanzien van de Britse kolonie Aden tot aan de onafhankelijkheid in 1967. De studie benadrukt de complexiteit en nuances die inherent zijn aan de politieke verhoudingen in het naoorlogse Verenigd Koninkrijk, en onderstreept de noodzaak van een analyse om het concept van consensus te evalueren. Door een herwaardering van de rol van de Suez-crisis en de daaruit voortvloeiende veranderingen binnen het defensie- en koloniale beleid, wordt een vernieuwende blik geworpen op de invloed van deze crisis op de politieke consensus. De kolonie Aden fungeert als casestudy binnen het onderzoek, en er wordt uitgebreid gebruik gemaakt van de Britse Defence White Papers als primaire bronnen van informatie.

In this study, I aim to understand the relation between Schrödinger’s physics and his embrace of Indian philosophy. By showing how Schrödinger embedded his physics in his overarching philosophical worldview, I argue that Indian philosophy takes up a seemingly modest yet ever-so-important role in Schrödinger’s life and work. I show in this thesis how Advaita Vedāntin insights on monism and the illusory character of distinct phenomena form the core of Schrödinger’s metaphysics. In turn, this worldview serves as a guiding framework in his life, thought, and professional work, including his physics. This thesis clarifies the existing confusion in current scholarship on Schrödinger’s use of Indian thought. Furthermore, as an interdisciplinary and intercultural case-study, this thesis sheds light on debates on the role of philosophy in physics, specifically the role of Indian and intercultural philosophy in contemporary thought.","['Schrödinger, Indian Philosophy, Advaita Vedānta, Quantum Mechanics, Intercultural Philosophy, History and Philosophy of Science']"

The protagonist in Alan Bennett’s “The Uncommon Reader” is based on Queen Elizabeth II and contains features that are not present in Dutch. In order to investigate how the idiolect of the protagonist has been translated into Dutch, the research question for this thesis is the following: “How is the royal idiolect in ‘The Uncommon Reader’ by Alan Bennett translated into Dutch?” This was researched by determining the features of the idiolect of Queen Elizabeth II; which of these features were used by Bennett; and how they were translated into Dutch. The royal idiolect in “The Uncommon Reader” was analysed and compared to the Dutch translation. In order to determine how the idiolect was translated, the translation strategies used by the translators were determined based on the analysis. The results of the analysis show that the translators stayed close to the source text by maintaining the linguistic variation that is used in the source text. They also used several translation strategies to maintain the sense of the source text, while changing some features of the royal idiolect that were not present in the target language. The translation strategies that the translators used the most are: clause structure change; sentence structure change; changes in schemes and tropes; explication; and paraphrasing.","['idiolect translation, literary translation, translation strategies']"

"The Horror of the Human: A Contrastive Analysis of Monstrosity, Heroism, and Theology in Beowulf and Frankenstein","Matheijsen, Julia",['Drs. E. Ramirez Perez'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"No matter if one intends to study the Marvel, Star Wars, DC Extended Universe franchise, or medieval and gothic literature, one will find that there is one fundamental element that incites the expected tension present within all of those works: the presence of both a monster and its opponent, the hero, whose interaction serves as the baseline for the plot. In this thesis, the dynamics between the presumed monsters and heroes within two of England’s greatest literary works, Beowulf (Anonymous, ca. 8th-11th century) and Frankenstein (Mary Shelley, 1818), are explored from a number of angles. The objective of this analysis is to comprehend the dynamic between opponent and monster by exploring the notions of monstrosity, heroism, and, ultimately, the relation of both to theology. As Beowulf and Frankenstein were produced in distinct time periods, both works convey and exhibit specific cultural components with respect to these notions. Beowulf, as an Early Medieval text, is a primary example of a heroic epic poem, and is the product of a culture in which Christianity began to manifest itself as a predominant theology in traditional Anglo-Saxon society. Frankenstein, first published in 1818, is written in a tumultuous period with respect to religion and science, as the two seem to be competing in a race for credibility and moral acceptance. Comparing the two works with one another illustrates the gradual difference between the Early Medieval culture and the Late Modern English culture of the 19th century with respect to the ideologies and concerns regarding monstrosity, heroism, morality, and theology. Such a contrastive analysis of both works, to my awareness, has not been made to date. First, the theoretical framework and the historical context of both works are discussed in chapter one. Subsequently, Frankenstein is analyzed in chapter two and Beowulf in chapter three. Finally, these findings are combined and re-evaluated in order to return with a final answer to the initial question that is central within this thesis: to what extent do the dynamics between monster and hero in both Beowulf and Frankenstein reflect the contemporary concerns and ideologies regarding monstrosity, heroism, and theology?","['Beowulf', 'Frankenstein', 'Monstrosity', 'Heroism', 'Theology']"
