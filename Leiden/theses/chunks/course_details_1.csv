Colorism Amongst Asians: The History of Colorism and its Influence on the Present,"Jansen, Claire","['Naafs, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Colorism, an issue that can be dated back thousands of years ago, is an issue of big importance in the present day. People will often compare it to racism, and although it has its similarities, it is not the same. There is a global preference for lighter skin, which affects people not only socially, but also economically. The color of one's skin affects their day-to-day life and is other than skin tone, strongly connected to gender and class. Specifically looking at Asian societies, the preference for a lighter skin has existed for a long time, but got stronger and developed further ever since Western colonization and their ideas of race and skin color. In the modern day these skin color ideals keep getting reinforced, not only by Western influences, but also by inter-Asian influences. The idea of ""beauty"" in Asia is having a lighter skin tone and even having certain Western facial features, as their desire is to look like ""high-class Asians"" (and thus not necessarily to look white). These beauty ideals keep getting reinforced by media and popular culture, and has a big impact on Asians, especially young Asian women. This causes many Asians to bleach their skin, sometimes even when they know it can be harmful to their physical health as they believe the benefits of having a lighter skin outweighs the potential risks. Colorism is not an often talked about issue and is not a widely known topic, even though it affects so many people’s lives every single day. It is a complex concept that is intersectional and has many causes and effects.","['Colorism', 'Skin Color', 'Race', 'Gender', 'Class', 'Inequality', 'Colonialism', 'Asia', 'Inter-Asian Referencing', 'Skin Bleaching', 'Beauty']"

Creative Strategies for a Society in Change: Multimodal Investigations at the Forefront of Epistemological Inquiry.,"Schönberger, Thomas","['Boy, J.D.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis delves into the intersection of investigative aesthetics and multimodal methodologies in the context of anthropological ethnographic inquiry. Focused on three investigative projects–the Visual Investigations Team of The New York Times, Forensic Architecture, and Earthrise Studio–the thesis explores how these initiatives harness the power of multimodal storytelling to uncover hidden truths, expose injustice, and promote accountability. Examining the rise of investigative Aesthetics within the media landscape, the thesis sheds light on the challenges of information overstimulation, misinformation, and distrust in media and scientific knowledge. It highlights how investigative projects act as beacons of truth amidst the chaos, offering an avenue to navigate complex global issues with integrity and depth. Furthermore, the thesis presents the implications of investigative endeavors for Public Anthropology, underscoring the significance of embracing innovative approaches to enhance the impact and reach of anthropological research in the digital age.","['(Investigative Journalism', 'Multimodality', 'Investigative Aesthetics', 'Visual investigation', 'Forensic Architecture', 'Earth Rise Studio', 'Anthropological Ethnographic inquiry', 'Public Anthropology', 'Social Justice', 'Social Media)']"

Acting Upon Love: Making Justice Real through Loving,"Rodao Herrero, Florentino","['Boy, J.D.', 'Ochigame, R.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Unconditional love is theorized across different fields to be key for making our politics more forgiving and our social justice more effective. This is because of love’s 1) willed character in contrast to mere sentimentalism, 2) its dynamic tendency towards turning love into action and help, 3) the forgiveness it brings that is necessary for embracing the heterogeneity of politics, 4) the purpose and embrace it can give to the anger that sprouts out of societal injustice, 5) the embodiedness and personal touch that they give to policies of care, and 6) a common interest with justice towards giving loveable people what they deserve. However, this is not just theory, and as a proper anthropologist I have shown how different actors longing for social justice put this love-justice relation into practice. Ranging from meditating to embody love and turn political and societal ideals of embrace into a reality, to seeing love as entailing and impulsing a drive towards LGBT+ inclusion campaigns and justice, all across the world love is employed as a vital component for making a better world. I have argued that unconditional love has a wide variety of benefits it can bring to social justice, both seen by academics and by actors that put this into practice. Because in the end, love’s dynamic character cannot let us sit still when we see that those we love deserve better.","['Love', 'One Piece', 'Martin Luther King', 'MLK', 'Justice', 'Unconditional love', 'Manga', 'Agape']"

To do so, this thesis firstly departs from current narratives related to the dichotomy between humans and machines to analyze the novel role social scientists play in this digital reality and future. Secondly, this thesis addresses what an interdisciplinary methodology of social scientists applying computational techniques may look like, as well as helps to answer the part of the research question that deals with “incorporating” the two disciplines. This more technical section focused on Laura K. Nelson’s Computational Grounded Theory which sets out to incorporate computational tools for social scientists wanting to conduct content analysis. Finally, this thesis highlights viable solutions for social science research and more culturally-centered research is working towards creating more human-centered algorithms by exploring possible strategies for cultural interpretations of these existing systems by evaluating metrics of algorithmic systems.","['Digitalization', 'Methodologies', 'AI', 'Interdisciplinary collaboration', 'Algorithm design', 'Human-centered design']"

Classcore: Looking For Class In The Digital Age: Transmediated Constructions Of Class-Based Femininities,"Alcalá Pérez, Laura","['Naafs, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Following the pioneer work of Bettie,Ortner and McRobbie, this thesis analyzes how cultural discourses arisen from big societal trends in the last decades have contributed to a limited consideration of young women’s class realities. As the internet has become part of everyday life, it has opened up new possibilities for identity formation and representation. Following the increasing blurring between offline and online spaces and identities, the analysis also looks at class, at the intersection of other social axes, as it acquires a transmediated nature, and presents the ways in which online presence and practice remains highly classed and gendered. The three chapters unveil the influence of postfeminism, neoliberalism, and postindustrialism on class expressions, the impact of digital spaces on identity negotiation, and the agency of young women in countering dominant discursive structures. Through an intersectional and transmediated lens, this work emphasizes the importance of recognizing class complexities within contemporary identities. By connecting historical insights with present-day considerations, it contributes to a comprehensive understanding of class dynamics and the nuanced interactions between class, gender, and digital spaces. Current considerations include the content of popular discourse and media, the use of digital spaces and a conceptualization of internet aesthetics such as 'cottagecore' and 'dark academia'. Each chapter offers a specific lens into why and how the class realities of young women are both expressed and hidden through the current prevalent discourses informing the construction, explanation and understanding of young women’s identities.","['class', 'gender', 'identity', 'femininities', 'cultural discourse', 'popular discourse', 'postfeminism', 'neoliberalism', 'online space', 'digital', 'social media', 'internet aesthetics', 'cottagecore', 'dark academia']"

Deradicalization Dilemma: Balancing Public Opinion and Government Action,"Zekri, Salma",['Dr. Babak RezaeeDaryakenari'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the impact of public opinion on the establishment of deradicalization programs for returning foreign fighters. The issue of returning foreign fighters has become increasingly relevant in recent years and governments worldwide have been struggling to reintegrate them back into society. By implementing a bottom-up approach to deradicalization initiatives, this thesis contributes to the body of literature on counterterrorism and sheds light on the potential influence of public opinion on the implementation of deradicalization programs. Agency theory, which forms the foundation of the study, contends that there will be a weak implementation when public opinion is against a deradicalization program, but the government is in favor of it. To test this theory and the causal mechanism suggested, this thesis studies France as the case using a qualitative method that incorporates process tracing and discourse analysis. The thesis’ findings support the claim that when the government is in favor of deradicalization programs, but the public is not, the programs will be weakly implemented with a high likelihood of failure.","['Deradicalization, Rehabilitation, Foreign Fighters, France, Public Opinion, Twitter, Counterterrorism']"

The Coloniality of Migration Ethics: The Case of Undocumented Migrants,"Labib, Albena",['D.E. Gómez Uribe'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Migration ethics has its strongest implications on the particularly vulnerable population of undocumented migrants. In philosophy, decolonial conceptions of migration ethics have surfaced as a counterargument to the hegemonic canon of migration ethics, with the latter approaches focusing on the extent of a state’s right to regulate its borders and the former approaches undermining this state right to exclusion in order to uplift the rights of the migrant. In legal practice, the theory of the Strasbourg reversal argues that the ECtHR, the judicial human rights body representing the European states of the Global North, has an inclination to side with the state in its rulings, whilst the IACHR, the human rights court representing the Latin American states of the Global South, has a pro-homine bias. This study conducted a discourse analysis of a legal ruling from each court pertaining to undocumented migrants to explore the extent that decision-making in verdicts towards undocumented migrants is influenced by coloniality in migration ethics, through either a hegemonic or decolonial conception of migration ethics. The results show that the ECtHR is influenced by the hegemonic discourse and the IACHR is influenced by the decolonial discourse, although there remains room for even more decolonial radicality.",
Context matters: Differences between Jordan and Lebanon in providing Syrian Refugee Education,"Khalaf, Layan","['van Meegdenburg, H.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The purpose of this study was to explore how the local context of host countries shapes the provision of education to refugees. To achieve this aim, a comparative case study of Syrian refugee education in host countries Lebanon and Jordan was undertaken. Resting on the theoretical argument that context inherently matters for outcomes, it was expected that contextual differences between Jordan and Lebanon will have created differences in education for refugee children. Interviews were conducted with experts that have worked at various organizations in either context, in order to corroborate data from document research published by the governments, NGOs, or international organizations. An analysis of these diverse sources produced five contextual factors – political context, economic context, encampment policy, family practices, and cultural proximity – that provide an answer to this study’s research question and further endorse the notion that context inherently matters, and that ‘good practice’ for refugee education is highly contextual. In light of the contextual differences found, and their unique effects on refugee education, it can be said that Jordan and Lebanon should not be grouped together as hastefully as is done by existing scholarship, but should each be treated in their own right instead.","['local context, host countries, refugees, refugee education']"

Political strategic silence and social movements: understanding how Bolsonaro’s silence mobilized a post-electoral social movement in Brazil,"Bretas Lopes, Heron Luiz","['Masullo, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Based on the theory of strategic silence, this paper analyzes the mobilization of social movements in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, following 2022 presidential elections and the unexpected silence of President Bolsonaro about his loss. The objective of this paper is to understand the degree to which silence influence collective mobilization. By drawing on social movements theory and political strategic silence theory, this paper creates a theoretical model to test the effects of silence, thus challenging a long existing notion that the effects of silence cannot be studied due to the difficulty in establishing casual links. A qualitative case study allied with semi-structured interviews of 8 protest leaders are used to test the theoretical model and understand the extent to which Bolsonaro’s silence played a part in their decision to mobilize. This paper finds that political strategic silence may increase the likelihood of mobilization when political opportunity, perceived threats and framing are also present.",

Kleur en vorm geven aan gevoel: Een onderzoek naar het verband tussen het gebruik van Buts en Bofn en emotieherkenning bij kinderen,"Maas, Amber","['Rippe, R.C.A']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het afgelopen studiejaar is er onderzoek gedaan naar de methode Buts en Bofn door studenten aan de Universiteit van Leiden. Tijdens een sessie met Buts en Bofn wordt er gewerkt met blokjes in verschillende vormen en kleuren. De blokjes kunnen kinderen helpen om hun gevoelens zichtbaar en bespreekbaar te maken (Buts en Bofn, 2023). In overeenstemming met de opdrachtgever, Jeanette van Tricht, is de volgende onderzoeksvraag geformuleerd: ‘In welke mate is er een verband tussen een sessie met de methode Buts en Bofn en het vermogen om emoties te herkennen bij anderen, bij kinderen in de leeftijdsgroep van 6 tot 12 jaar?’. Om deze onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden, is er data verzameld met behulp van de Emotion Recognition Task (ERT). Deze test is gebaseerd op en gevalideerd door wetenschappelijk onderzoek (Metrisquare, 2023; Kessels & Montagne, 2017). Bij het invullen van de ERT kregen de participanten gezichten te zien, die wisselende emoties uitdrukten. Van de participanten werd gevraagd om te beoordelen welke emotie bij de getoonde gezichtsuitdrukking hoort. Er is zowel een voor- als nameting afgenomen bij de participanten. Tussen deze twee metingen zat tenminste één sessie waarin de methode Buts en Bofn is ingezet. De resultaten van de ERT suggereren dat er een kleine vooruitgang is in het vermogen om emoties te herkennen van de participanten na een behandeling met Buts en Bofn. Dit wijst op een eventueel positief verband tussen Buts en Bofn en emotieherkenning. Daarnaast lijkt de emotie blijheid gemiddeld genomen het beste te wordt herkend. Naast dat de vooruitgang in testscores een verband kan hebben met de methode Buts en Bofn, zijn er ook andere mogelijke verklaringen voor de vooruitgang. Een mogelijke andere verklaring is bijvoorbeeld dat er sprake is van een leereffect. Er zou sprake zijn van een leereffect wanneer de prestaties van participanten op de ERT verbeteren doordat ze geleerd hebben om de emoties van specifieke gezichten te herkennen tijdens de voormeting (Leary, 2012). Verder kan de vooruitgang die is gevonden verklaard worden door een andere therapievorm die gelijktijdig werd gegeven of de kwaliteiten van de professionals. Voor het onderzoek werd er gestreefd naar minimaal 20 participanten. Dit aantal is niet gehaald. Uiteindelijk zijn er vijf participanten die de ERT volledig hebben afgerond. Een verklaring hiervoor is dat de professionals geen tijd of mogelijkheid hadden om mee te werken aan het onderzoek. Doordat de steekproefgrootte klein was, moesten de resultaten voorzichtig geïnterpreteerd worden. Daarnaast konden er geen statistische toetsen gedaan worden. De resultaten van de ERT zijn daarom visueel gemaakt om mogelijke patronen zichtbaar te maken. Op basis van de onderzoeksresultaten is er een advies gegeven aan de opdrachtgever. De kern hiervan is om te investeren in de gebruikerscommunity, zodat er in eventueel vervolgonderzoek meer duidelijk is over de frequentie en de manier waarop professionals Buts en Bofn inzetten. Dit kan gedaan worden door online feedbackformulieren, die de professionals naar de opdrachtgever sturen. Voor vervolgonderzoek moet er rekening gehouden worden met de beperkingen vanuit het huidige onderzoek. Zo werd er veel van de professionals gevraagd en was het gebruik van de ERT lastig. Door meer inzicht te krijgen in de gebruikerscommunity zou er in vervolgonderzoek een gerichtere onderzoeksvraag kunnen worden gesteld, waarbij mogelijke beperkingen al van tevoren kunnen worden voorkomen. Een ander advies is om kinderen die nog niet hebben gewerkt met Buts en Bofn, kennis te laten maken met de methode door te beginnen met makkelijk herkenbare emoties, zoals blijdschap en boosheid.","['Buts & Bofn', 'emotieherkenning', 'kleur & gevoel']"

Draagkracht en draaglast onder Nederlandse jongeren: In opdracht van GGD Zeeland en het Nederlands Centrum Jeugdgezondheidszorg,"Herrenberg, Dunya","['Lotz, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het is bekend dat het mede door de coronacrisis slecht is gesteld met het welzijn van jongeren. Om dit welzijn van jongeren in kaart te kunnen brengen, is het nuttig om inzicht te verkrijgen in de factoren die volgens jongeren bijdragen aan hun draagkracht en draaglast. Daarom is er behoefte aan het ontwikkelen van een balansmeter voor jongeren. Deze balansmeter kan bijdragen aan de vroegsignalering en mogelijke preventie van latere problematiek, om zo het welzijn van jongeren te kunnen verhogen. Dit onderzoek vormt de eerste stap in het proces richting het ontwikkelen van een balansmeter. De vraag die centraal staat in dit onderzoek is welke factoren Nederlandse jongeren van 13 tot en met 15 jaar ervaren als belangrijk voor het definiëren van hun draagkracht en draaglast. Om dit te meten is een online vragenlijst ontwikkeld waarin de domeinen mentaal welzijn, fysiek welzijn, sociale relaties, schoolbeleving, leefomgeving en vrijetijdsbesteding zijn uitgevraagd. Op basis van de resultaten blijken factoren met betrekking tot sociale relaties, met name in de thuissituatie, van belang te zijn voor draagkracht. Factoren met betrekking tot het mentaal welzijn worden als belangrijkst ervaren voor draaglast. Er wordt geadviseerd om aan de hand van voorgaande factoren in te zetten op preventie en vroegsignalering van problematiek onder jongeren. Ook kan aanvullend kwantitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd worden onder een andere representatieve steekproef om zo de resultaten beter te kunnen generaliseren. Daarnaast wordt geadviseerd om door middel van kwalitatief onderzoek het belang van de gevonden factoren uit te laten diepen door jongeren. Ten slotte is het interessant om de onderzochte leeftijdscategorie te vergelijken met de leeftijd van 16 tot en met 18 jaar wat betreft de ervaren draagkracht en draaglast. Daarmee kan onderzocht worden of het nuttig is om voor elke leeftijdscategorie apart een balansmeter te ontwikkelen.","['Draaglast', 'draagkracht', 'jongeren', 'welzijn', 'balansmeter']"
Leseffecten vergroten van de Noordwijkse Methode,"Lamers, Ezrie","['Schlatter, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek bestaat uit een literatuur- en observationeel onderzoek. De twee onderzoeksvragen die hierbij centraal staan, luiden als volgt: “Welke leselementen die het probleemoplossend vermogen stimuleren bij basisschoolleerlingen zijn bekend in de literatuur?” en “Hoe vaak komen deze leselementen voor tijdens de bovenbouwvakateliers van de Noordwijkse Methode?” Bij de Noordwijkse Methode krijgen leerlingen in de ochtend les over de basisvakken en in de middag wordt tijd besteed aan de overige vakken in vakateliers onder leiding van gespecialiseerde leerkrachten. Tijdens de vakateliers werken leerlingen binnen een overkoepelend thema en wordt gebruik gemaakt van de denkbubbels die centraal staan in de Noordwijkse Methode. Dit zijn een set vragen waarmee alle aspecten van onderzoekend leren aan bod komen (De Noordwijkse Methode, 2021a). Binnen de denkbubbels wordt gestreefd om probleemoplossend vermogen te stimuleren. De eerste onderzoeksvraag wordt beantwoord middels het literatuuronderzoek, waarvoor in de literatuur is gezocht naar stimulerende leselementen voor het probleemoplossend vermogen. Er zijn verschillende zoekmachines en zoektermen gebruikt om de betrouwbaarheid van het literatuuronderzoek te waarborgen. Vervolgens is op basis van dit onderzoek een observatieformulier van vijftien observatiepunten opgesteld dat gebruikt is tijdens de observaties. Aan de hand van de verkregen data van dit observatieonderzoek is de tweede onderzoeksvraag beantwoord. Tijdens zeven vakateliers zijn zeven verschillende leerkrachten geobserveerd, deze observaties duurden tussen de 60 en 105 minuten. De geobserveerde vakateliers bestonden uit zowel reguliere vakateliers als verwerkingslessen. Bij verwerkingslessen moeten leerlingen laten zien welk leerdoel zij geleerd hebben, als afsluiting van het thema en krijgen zij geen uitleg. Uit de observaties bleek dat leerkrachten sommige leselementen, zoals inspelen op voorkennis, conceptuele uitleg en scaffolding vaak toepasten. De leselementen het aanbieden van realistische problemen, toepassen van modeling door de leerkracht, samenwerken van leerlingen, visueel denken van leerlingen, en het gebruik van wijsgebaren door de leerkracht werden echter door weinig leerkrachten toegepast. Voor het leselement motivatie geldt dat sommige leerkrachten dit leselement vaak toepasten en anderen zelden. Daarnaast is onderzocht of er een verschil was tussen de leselementen die werden toegepast in een regulier vakatelier en in een verwerkingsles. Hieruit bleek dat bij de leselementen inspelen op voorkennis, probleem identificeren, en scaffolding een significant verschil was. Deze leselementen kwamen gemiddeld vaker voor tijdens de reguliere vakateliers dan in de verwerkingslessen. Op basis van het onderzoek kan geconcludeerd worden dat leerkrachten van de Noordwijkse Methode veel stimulerende leselementen van probleemoplossend vermogen toepassen. Een aantal leselementen worden echter onvoldoende toegepast. Dit zijn onder andere realistische problemen, modeling, samenwerken, visueel denken, en wijsgebaren. Daarom wordt geadviseerd om leerkrachten de mogelijkheid te geven om hun kennis te vergroten en te oefenen met het toepassen van alle stimulerende leselementen. Dit geldt zowel voor de reguliere vakateliers als voor de verwerkingslessen. De Noordwijkse Methode kan dit realiseren door de self-efficacy van leerkrachten te vergroten, bijpassende studiedagen in te richten, en de leselementen in de denkbubbels te implementeren.","['Noordwijkse Methode', 'leseffecten', 'vakateliers', 'onderwijsmethode', 'coöperatief leren']"
De invloed van intelligentieniveau en executief functioneren op de uitstroomrichting in het VSO voor leerlingen met een autismespectrumstoornis.,"Warmerdam, Lisanne",['DR. Rachel Plak'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurological condition that profoundly impacts individuals throughout their lives. In special secondary education, autistic youth frequently receive inaccurate post-secondary destinations due to a deficit of knowledge and guidelines for assessing factors like intelligence and executive functioning within a developmental framework. This study aimed to explore the role of intelligence and executive functioning in determining the post-secondary destinations of autistic students in special secondary education. Gaining insight into the factor determining the transition outcomes of autistic students is crucial, as these outcomes significantly impact their future career prospects and further education. Consequently, this study could help prevent the negative consequences such as over- and underload and societal disengagement. Data were obtained by analysing developmental perspective files, with a total of 14 participants (93% male) aged 12-18 years included in the study. The findings suggest that autistic students with higher levels of intelligence are more inclined to pursue further education. Conversely, those with higher levels of executive functioning tend to have a lower likelihood of transitioning to further education and tend to gravitate towards employment. Furthermore, executive functioning was found to moderate the relationship between intelligence and the post-secondary destination. When executive functioning is low, there is a stronger correlation between intelligence and post-secondary destination.

Does dynamic training have an effect on children's performance in a dynamic visual-spatial complex figure drawing task?,"Asimakopoulou, Magdalini",['Veerbeek J.(Jochanan)'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Process-oriented dynamic testing aims to investigate children's processes to solve cognitive tasks and evaluate changes in these processes due to training. The aim of the present study was to explore if dynamic training within a dynamic test has an effect on children's performance in a dynamic visual-spatial complex figure-drawing task. Children's working memory and planning ability were considered as possible predictors of their performance in both phases (pre-post). Participants were 46 regular primary school children (M=9.8 years, standard deviation [SD] =0.87 years). Planning proved a non-significant predictor in both phases. However, working memory proved a non-significant predictor in the pre-test and post-copy phase but significantly related to the accuracy of drawing by memory in the post-phase. Also, repeated practice and training significantly improved from the pre to the post-test. However, the training did not lead to significantly more improvement from pre to post-test than repeated practice.","['dynamic testing, process-oriented measurement, visual- spatial complex figure drawing task, graduated prompts, working memory, planning']"
Systematic Review in Interventions for eating difficulties in children with autism spectrum disorders,"Pepelasi, Artemis","['Veek, S.M.C. van der']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by deficits in sociability, behaviour and communication. Children with autism spectrum disorder often face eating difficulties. Those difficulties might be accompanied by disruptive behaviours. Individuals with autism and their families might therefore be negatively influenced by such eating difficulties. The aim of the present research was to examine the interventions available in the literature in order to treat eating difficulties children with ASD display. Therefore, the following research questions were formulated: What interventions exist for treating eating difficulties in children with ASD? What techniques are effective in treating eating difficulties in children with ASD? Are interventions that include parents more effective in treating eating difficulties in children with ASD compared to those that do not include parents? To answer the research questions, a systematic literature review was conducted. The PICO system was used to establish the search term of the review. The quality of the selected studies was assessed by two independent reviewers, using a combination of methodological quality assessment tools. Regarding the first research question, eleven interventions were available for eating difficulties in children with ASD. The other two research questions failed to be answered. No specific technique was found as effective in treating eating related difficulties, yet the combination of techniques was used among the studies. Reinforcement accompanied by other techniques, constitutes promising results. None of the studies compared interventions which include parents and not include parents. Based on this, it is recommended that further research is needed to be performed, provided with more rigorous research designs in order to test the effectiveness of techniques and parental component in the interventions treating eating difficulties in children with ASD.",

Ons Boere Goed: An Exploration into Farmers' Cosmovisions in Relation to Blaming Narratives and Notions of Dignity,"Barink, Kirsten","['Bähre, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study researches conventional farmers' resentment towards the nitrogen policies in the context of Zeeland (a Dutch region in the South-West of the Netherlands). Since 2019, when the Raad van State decided that the current policies on Plan Handling Nitrogen (Plan Aanpak Stikstof, PAS) where insufficient in protecting Dutch nature reserves from biodiversity loss, strict regulations were opposed on the agricultural sector by the government. From that moment the already dormant crisis became ignited, because many farmers strongly resisted these regulations in what became known as ‘the farmers protests’. To be able to understand farmers' resentment both in its diversity and in its depth, this thesis focusses on farmers' cosmovisions in relation to blaming narratives and notions of dignity. Each showing a different element of what resentment entails. The research shows how conventional farmers are resentful towards the nitrogen policies, because their perspectives of the world, structured through their cosmovisions, are fundamentally different from the perspectives underlaying the nitrogen policies. Because of this, they blame others, which are to a lesser degree, affected by the policies, such as big industries, but mostly the actors that inflicted this experience on them. At the same time they feel a denial of their dignity, as they feel unrecognized as fulfilling an essential role in society.Understanding these three aspects is vital for understanding the deeply felt emotions that are at play in farmers’ lives during the nitrogen crisis. The aim of this research is to bring nuance in the polarized discussion around nitrogen. While facing many (societal and ecological) future crises, both in the Netherlands and on a larger scale, I argue that research on which convictions and beliefs form resentment, can be the only basis from which relevant policies should be constructed.","[""Cosmovision, blame, dignity, resentment, farmers' protests, nitrogen crisis""]"

This assumption is put as unreliable, however ethnographic findings reveal that women of the Greek island Corfu redefine ‘closeness to nature’ through the practice of herbalism. This study shows a nuanced depiction of the relationship between women and the natural environment, by revaluating notions of care and labor. Through ethnographic methods based on participant observation, in-depth interviews and filming, data is obtained. The data shows that the women of Corfu use herbalism as a means to be independent from their demanding role as caregivers; traditional knowledge is based on connections with past generations that refer to survival skills; herbalism teaches how mainstream society can live more sustainable. Concluding, herbalism is more than a practice. In the context of Corfu, herbalism critiques capitalist economies and creates a sustainable relationship with the natural environment. Through redefining labor and performing care as herbalist practice, lived experiences refine discussions on ‘women as closer to nature’.","['herbalism', 'ecofeminism', 'traditional knowledge', 'sustainability', 'care', 'labor', 'medicinal herbs', 'Corfu', 'Greece', 'survival skills', 'intergenerational', 'ethnography']"
(UN)SILENCED: What doesn't kill us makes us louder: A Visual Ethnography of Academic Censorship and Palestinian Resistance,"Persico, Giulia Sole",['Mark Westmoreland'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Academic freedom is a core value of Western higher education, with freedom of speech and research being its main pillars. When it comes to Palestinian rights, however, these principles are often applied selectively or fail to materialize at all. By conducting qualitative ethnographic research on and in collaboration with Palestinian advocacy groups in the Netherlands, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of how and why anti-Zionist dissent is often silenced in the context of Dutch academia. This multimodal research focuses on one particular event of academic censorship that resulted in the cancelation of a panel discussion organized by “Students for Palestine” (SfP). The visual output shows my main interlocutors gradually reconstructing what happened through a decolonial lens; they bear upon colonial and orientalist practices in order to deconstruct this specific incident. I then elaborate on these practices in this article, in order to provide a deeper understanding of what laid the foundation of this censorship case. I do this by looking at the impact that orientalist and neoliberalist practices have on the institutional censorship of Palestine. The written output also more accurately discusses the aftermath of this event, that is the way the student group resisted this discrimination case by means of an academic boycott. Moreover, both the visual and text portions of this thesis offer a thorough analysis of what it means for minoritized and racialized voices to be silenced and delegitimized, and how censoring attempts affect Palestinian identity. Finally, the article provides a reflexive analysis that is meant to gauge the extent to which internalized sentiments of fear and paranoia within the movement at large influenced my own ability to gain access and trust throughout the realization of this study.","['Academic freedom, censorship, decoloniality, silence, Orientalism, delegitimization, Neoliberalism, boycott, paranoia, reflexivity.']"
Inspiration farmer: A visual ethnography on a Dutch agroforestry farmer,"Schollaardt, Kiki",['Sander Hölsgens'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The global climate crisis shows the need to take measures to reduce our emissions. With agriculture taking up more than half of the land in The Netherlands, policies to achieve this primarily focus on the agrarian sector. Consequently, the uncertainty for farmers’ future practices led to big national farmers’ protests, followed by a national win for the farmers’ party on a provincial level. With farming deeply rooted in culture and place, acknowledging the need to look at the social side of the issue is vital for establishing a sustainable agricultural system. This research uses visual ethnography’s strengths, giving insight into a sustainable practice in the Anthropocene and providing a new view of human-environment relationships. It does so by looking at a Dutch agroforestry farmer who acknowledges an inherent connection between humans and non-humans within his practices. Moreover, the motivation for his practices lies in his ideologies, prioritising non-human nature over humanity. These perspectives can help us find a way to overcome the agrarian crisis in The Netherlands by producing an alternate view on human-environment relationships. It overall inspires us to think that when we care for the non-human, we will ultimately take care of ourselves.","['Agriculture, Agroforestry, Human-environment relaAonships, Anthropocene, Sustainability']"
Nostalgia and Musical Objects: The Role of Music from Turkey and Material Objects in Connection to Nostalgia,"Mese, Ece","['Fogarty-Valenzuela, Benjamin']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The interest towards music of Turkey in Europe is growing in the last decade under the emerging genre of “Neo-Anatolian” music in relation to migrants from Turkey living in Germany. Even though migration studies have always put the conditions of guest workers from Turkey living in Germany under the magnifying glass, there hasn’t been much research regarding the relationship between the sense of nostalgia, material culture and music among new-wave migrants. This research was set out to bridge this gap. The research was conducted from January 2023 until March 2023 with new-wave migrants from Turkey living in Berlin by employing structured observation, participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and music elicitation interviews as methods. With the findings of the fieldwork and in relation to the existing literature, the research project concludes that nostalgia in relation to music is experienced to construct a relationship between the self and personal history, nostalgia became a commodified experience in the music scene with the revival of gazinos and the emergence of the arabesque genre among the new wave migrants and musical objects may help us to reconstruct certain memories and provide a material dimension to our personal history.","['nostalgia, material culture']"

Jewish? A Visual Auto-Ethnoghraphy: On Collaborating Jewish Meaning.,"Goldberg, Eden","['Westmoreland, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Despite having been the most influential Jewish population in the world, seventy-eight years after the Shoah Jewish life in the Netherlands remains ambiguous. For Dutch Jews, especially those non- religious, a post-war memorialisation of genocide overwhelmingly determines what it means to be Jewish today. This Dutch post-war reality materializes in the omnipresence of Jewish death (monuments, memorials, and museums) and the absence of Jewish life (shops, bakeries, and restaurants) in Dutch public spaces which contributes to the invisibility of Jewish contemporary life, vitality and joy. This has led to a generational search for ways to reclaim, co-construct and make space for contemporary Dutch Jewish identity and life. This research is an expression of such a search, where it simultaneously explores and constructs a future-oriented rethinking of being and doing Jewish in a Dutch contemporary context. It does so by using ‘future-memory work’ as a methodological tool to explore what it could mean to be Jewish in the Netherlands today, making sense of a contemporary Jewish experience in relation to the past and the future. The study is an auto- ethnographic film project in which unaffiliated (not a member of a practising community) millennial Dutch Jews from Amsterdam, the Dutch city that had the largest Jewish population before the second world war, embark on a collaborative open-ended search for Jewish identity and community to learn about and beyond their families’ past.","[""Millennial Dutch Jews in search for Jewish identity, visual auto-ethnographic research, Jewish identity, Jewishness, Dutch postwar society and 'the Jew', Jewish futurism""]"

Our Own Pace: Stories of Black British women walking and talking in nature,"van Steijn, Tamar","['Westmoreland, M.R.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Exploring the countryside has been a phenomenon in the United Kingdom for many decades. In contemporary discourse, challenges to who frequents these landscapes have risen. Indeed, ethnic minorities are underrepresented in the UK outdoors communities. As stories of human’s relation to nature are foremost told from Eurocentric, white, and male perspectives, this thesis centres Black women and women of colour who are members of the women’s outdoors organisation Bristol Steppin Sistas (BSS). Operating as a safe space for black women and women of colour, the organisation organises multiple walks a month to get local women to explore rural landscapes in the UK’s South West region. This ethnographic research comprises two complimentary elements: a 30 min.-long film, and an article, which examine the role walking and talking in nature plays in the daily lives of black British women. It uses data gathered from interlocutor observation of BSS members, semi-structured sit-down interviews, and un-structured walk-along interviews with three members of the group, during two months of fieldwork. This article has the dual purpose of making theoretical arguments and discussing methodological considerations in reference to the film. In doing so, three key themes emerge: (1) BSS challenges racial and gender stigmas around exploring British nature, (2) the group provides a safe space for its members to gain a sense of belonging, strengthening their individual identities, (3) Black British women living in urban areas need the outdoors to lessen anxieties and better physical health. By claiming space in the South West UK’s countryside, BSS provides an indispensable community for black women and women of colour living in the hectic urban environment of Bristol.","['outdoors', 'walking ethnography', 'community-building', 'diaspora', 'Black British women', 'belonging', 'safe space']"

In North Jakarta, relationship with the environment is strongly affected by the presence of environmental issues, namely sea level rise, land subsidence, and chronic floods, which force local communities to come to terms with the surrounding waters on a daily basis, developing different experiences and perceptions of the environment. Moreover, such different experiences and perceptions are connected to political struggles related to the protection of the Jakarta bay ecosystem, the livelihood of fishing communities, and mitigation projects such as the construction of a giant seawall and of reclaimed islands off the coast of the city. The research population includes residents of four different neighbouring districts located along the coast of the Indonesian capital. Despite being so close to each other, these are very different areas, home to fish markets, fishing settlements and industries, luxurious residential areas, shining malls and exclusive leisure spaces. These districts are inhabited by very different communities in terms of social class, income, lifestyle, occupation, and ethnicity. Therefore, they are an ideal field to observe diverse forms of human-environment relationship, and to test to what extent could these be related to the above-mentioned inequalities and to different ontologies of the environment.","['environmental anthropology', 'human-environment relationship', 'inequalities', 'climate justice', 'ontology', 'sea level rise', 'urban development', 'Jakarta', 'Indonesia']"

Through a combination of casual conversations, semi-structured interviews, observation, use of drawings, and analysis of online discourse, this research unveils the strategies employed by community members to negotiate societal norms and expectations. After defining gender roles and expectations in Japan, the thesis focuses on looks and the ability to ""pass"" as a cisgender person, which not only influence trans and X-gender people's possibility to access to queer and non-queer settings, but also condition their gender performance. Afterwards, the thesis focuses on gender performance in the ""frontstage"" and ""backstage"". Whereas the ""frontstage"" showcases the performative aspects of gender identity, often influenced by societal pressures and traditional gender roles, the ""backstage"" allows for a more authentic exploration of self, often characterized by fluidity and experimentation.","['gender performance', 'queer', 'X-gender', 'trans', 'Japan', 'LGBT']"

It's all about understanding how factors like caste, gender, and labor intertwine to shape their lives in the bustling world of textile factories. The journey starts by shining a light on the influence of big international brands on the factories' conditions and how the caste systems still affects people’s lives and opportunities. We dig into how traditional gender roles shape the lives of these female workers, dealing with both unequal power dynamics and family expectations. With the guiding question, ""How exactly do female low-caste garment workers in South India show their power, and how do they tackle the challenges they face in their lives and jobs?"" in mind, the research takes us through six chapters. The heart of the matter reveals that these workers, despite the odds, aren't just passive players. They've got agency and plans, like prioritizing their children’s education if their financial situation allows it in order to break free from the cycle of struggle. And then there's the central role of NGOs like READ, who give them skills and a voice to demand better conditions. Wrapping it all up, the conclusion shows strength doesn't always mean pushing back hard; it's often about finding ways to stand tall and find strategies when facing difficulties. All said and done, this research paints a vivid picture of these female workers' multi-faceted strengths, highlighting how they navigate their world with grit and grace, all while shaking up the social norms that surround them.","['garment worker', 'textile worker', 'South India', 'anthropology', 'gender', 'women', 'female', 'caste', 'low caste', 'NGO', 'labour work', 'textile factory', 'garment factory', 'spinning mill', 'garment sector', 'working conditions', 'migration', 'agency']"

These global changes influence the local employment structure, the landscape, nature, biodiversity and the overall perception of agriculture. More than one third of the land in Romania is dedicated to agriculture, and nearly a quarter of the population works within the agricultural sector, which makes it an ideal area to examine how these global changes take place on a local level.

To shed light on how the sociocultural aspects of the farmers livelihoods and households relate towards the decisions and pathways farmers take within their profession. By both exploring the micro-level of the thoughts and actions of the farmers and how their households react to change, it gives implications on changes within the macro-level of regional and global structural changes taking place. This is done through case studies of farmers living in rural Transylvania. Reflection on these case studies is done through implementing Van der Ploeg his theory of repeasantisation.

National and international efforts are permeated by a lack of ambition and urgency. Psychosocial scholars have argued that this reflects a state of ecoparalysis, a result of ecoanxiety and fear of ecological destruction. However, this thesis argues that the ecological crisis and our responses to it cannot be seen in isolation from the hegemony of capitalism. Capitalism’s need for unlimited growth drives the ecological crisis. Under the current stage of capitalism, neoliberal rationality permeates our every interaction, neoliberal logics govern every sphere of life, and becomes common-sense. This thesis explores how this influences our responses to the ecological crisis. It argues that the hegemony of capitalism distorts reality in such a way that capitalism becomes what is real, and as a consequence we cannot conceive of ourselves or of the world outside of capitalism. This fosters an inability to see alternatives, thus, preventing us from collectively and meaningfully responding to the ecological crisis.","['ecological crisis', 'climate change', 'environment', 'hegemony', 'capitalism', 'neoliberalism', 'depoliticization', 'ecoparalysis', 'ecoanxiety']"

The inclusion of democratic values in the education law of nine different countries,"Rans, Bryant","['Reuler, A. A. H. E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Education is one of the most important determinants of an individual livelihood. Not only does education contribute to the development of a nation, but it also fosters democracy through the teachings of democratic values in schools and exposure to the benefits of civic engagement. Furthermore, the education system of a country is reflective of its ideology and can serve as a tool for the government to shape the view of its citizens. Literature on the relationship between democracy on education is vast, but most are based on quantitative measures. Thus, this research conducts a qualitative study in analysing the effect of the level of democracy on the inclusion of democratic values in the fundamental education law of each country. Employing a diverse case selection, qualitative content analysis method, and a deductive coding frame, this thesis finds that the effect of democracy on democratic values in education law has varying effects. A clear division based on the level of democracy is visible for democratic goals in the education law, but is less visible regarding participation, freedom, and equality. The findings of this thesis contribute to narrowing the literature gap and allow further understanding of the impact of democracy on daily life and human development.","['Democracy', 'education', 'Finland', 'Japan', 'South Africa', 'Namibia', 'Indonesia', 'Malaysia', 'Cambodia', 'Zimbabwe', 'China']"
"Exploring the Relationship between Empathy, Depression and Gender in Adolescents using Reported Causes of Depression","Flamand, Matthijs","['Elzinga, B.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: Depressive disorders represent a significant burden on mental health care services across the globe, with many cases starting during adolescence. Recent literature provides evidence that both high and low empathy may be risk factors for depression. This study explores the relationship between empathy and depression in a clinical (n=35) and non-clinical (n=80) sample of adolescents, while taking age and gender into account as potential confounding factors. Method: This study uses data from the Relations and Emotions in Parent-Adolescent Interaction Research (RE-PAIR). Participants filled out the PHQ, the perspective taking and empathic concern scales of the IRI, and parents and adolescents were interviewed surrounding the perceived causes of the adolescents’ depression. ANOVA comparisons were used to establish whether there are meaningful differences between depressed and non-depressed adolescents on measures of empathy while controlling for age and gender. To investigate whether low or high empathy scores are associated with higher severity of depression, depressed adolescents were divided in three groups for each measure of empathy according to empathy scores and compared in terms of PHQ scores. Finally, adolescents were grouped and compared based on empathy-associated reported causes of depression to determine whether those causes are associated with differences in empathy. Results: There was no association between depression and empathy scores. There was a significant difference on only one item of the IRI, which may drive a false positive correlation between affective empathy and depression. Gender was associated with significant differences in reported empathy scores, as was age. There was no significant relationship between empathy and severity of depression, nor between empathy and reported causes of depression. Conclusion: This study finds limited evidence for the relationship between empathy and depression. It highlights the importance of studying empathy in combination with other factors, and the challenges in measuring empathy in the context of depression. Limitations and implications of the findings are discussed.","['Empathy', 'Adolescent Depression', 'Adolescent Empathy', 'Reported Causes', 'Self-reported causes', 'IRI']"

In federal India, the municipal, provincial, and federal governments have all worked jointly to manage air pollution. Numerous studies have examined the effects of federalism on environmental policy, although frequently the studies place more of an emphasis on the federal structure than on the interests of sub-national entities in terms of the difficulties that arise in the implementation of environmental policy. Despite having federal frameworks that take into account diversity, India has trouble overcoming subnational interests. The geographical, socioeconomic, and political disparities between regions had distinct consequences on environmental governance. Even Though environmental laws are mostly designed to shield citizens from the tragedy of the commons it continues to be a central theme in many environmental problems. Thus, air pollution policy implementation is a Common Pool Resource management issue. Therefore, this thesis employs a qualitative content analysis on the Ambiguity-Conflict Model of Policy Implementation by Richard E. Matland to investigate the effect of sub-national interest on air pollution policy implementation in India. The results demonstrated a Low Ambiguity and High Conflict paradigm which conveys the effect of sub-national interest as Political Implementation of air pollution policies in India.","['Collective Action, Air Pollution, Sub-national interest, Policy Implementation']"
The Intimate Presence of the Future: A thesis on the effects of the imagined future on young climate activists in the Netherlands,"Leerdam, Roos van","['Fogarty-Valenzuela, B.L.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Within anthropological studies about climate activists (Cassegård & Thörn, 2018; Haugestad et al., 2021; Knops, 2023; Spyrou et al., 2022; Weij, 2022, i.a.), the way they imagine the future is often overlooked (Haugestad et al., 2021), even though this imagined future could be seen as the incentive for their actions. Taking this into account, the main objective of this article is to explore the imagined future of young climate activists in the Netherlands and the effect that the imagined future had on their lives in the present. The article is based on ethnographic fieldwork in the Netherlands among climate activists connected to the Extinction Rebellion movement. Through visual ethnography, in-depth interviews, experimental ethnography, participant observation and a reflective group video elicitation interview, I researched the present-day experiences of the activists from a future-focused approach. In doing so I answered my main research question: How does the imagined future of young climate activists affect their lives in the present? My main finding is that to the activists, the imagined future is intimately present in their lives, intertwined with their present experiences regarding their worldview, their affect, and the way they organize and devote their lives. With this research I hope to create more understanding of the experiences and motives of climate activists.","['Future anthropology, climate activism, Extinction Rebellion, Dutch climate activists, imagined future, catastrophism, video-elicitation interview, ethnographic film']"

The number of students that voluntarily read in their spare time is also decreasing. However, reading is an important presentation mode in order to understand information. The ability to process information is important in order to function in society. The purpose of this thesis is to research which factors influence story comprehension. The effect of presentation mode, child-specific-factors and reading skills on the ability to understand information was investigated. For instance, the influence of a reading comprehension-test and the class-level on the comprehension scores for each presentation mode was examined. Furthermore, the effect of the level of intrinsic reading-motivation and the frequency of reading in spare time on the scores of comprehension for reading was investigated. An experiment was carried out in which 82 students from grade 4, 5 and 6 answered comprehension questions about three stories that they have read, listened to and viewed. The participants also filled in questionnaires about reading, listening and viewing frequency and about intrinsic motivation. The analysis of the results showed that scores for comprehension differed between text and video, but not between audio and the other presentation modes. The highest scores are reached by viewing a story. The results showed also that the effect of presentation mode on the level of story comprehension is not different for various reading comprehension-test scores and class-levels. Eventually, only a small part of the comprehension score can be explained by intrinsic reading-motivation and the amount of reading in spare time. Intrinsic reading-motivation is the best explainer for this relationship. Implications for theory and practice were also discussed. Follow-up research could for example focus on different aspects of story comprehension, like retelling a story or predicting how a story will continue.","['story comprehension', 'reading comprehension', 'presentation mode', 'intrinsic reading motivation', 'narrative texts']"

Risk perception in social contexts in adolescents with AD/HD: the buffering role of peer attachment and adopting a continuous approach to AD/HD,"Opschoor, Adriana Cornelia Elizabeth",['Dr. J. van Hoorn'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Adolescents with ADHD partake in risk-taking behavior (RTB), such as risky driving or unsafe sex, more often than their peers. Because RTB is strongly related to risk perception and RTB takes place in a group of peers, it is important to gain a better understanding of risk perception in a social context. First, this study investigated whether adolescents with ADHD are more susceptible to 1) peer influence only and 2) peer influence and presence on a behavioral level. Further, we examined the neural responses to these two social manipulations. We examined whether peer attachment acted as a buffer against susceptibility. Finally, we adopted a continuous approach of ADHD and examined the link between inattention symptoms and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms and susceptibility to peer influence and presence. Adolescent boys (ages 13-23) with ADHD (n = 46) and without ADHD (n = 57) performed a risk rating task with a behavioral part and an fMRI-scanner part. The scanner part included highly believable virtual peer influence and peer presence manipulations. For our fMRI analyses we selected regions of interest that are implicated in the social brain (TPJ and dmPFC), the reward processing network (VS, Insula and vmPFC), and the cognitive control network (dlPFC). All adolescents showed equal susceptibility to peer influence only. Similarly, all adolescents showed a higher susceptibility to peer influence and presence. We found no effects on susceptibility of clinical diagnosis, inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms or peer attachment. Our fMRI results showed effects in the TPJ. First, peer influence only elicited less activation in the bilateral TPJ for adolescents with ADHD. Second, activity in the left TPJ elicited by peer influence and presence was stronger for adolescents with weaker peer attachment. Together, these findings indicate that peer influence and presence may partly cause increased RTB in adolescence. However, increased RTB in adolescents with ADHD cannot be explained by increased susceptibility peer influence and presence. These findings provide an opportunity to decrease excessive RTB through increasing resistance to peer influence and presence in interventions for adolescents in general.",

The association between cognitive fatigue and work functioning in employed individuals with multiple sclerosis,"Weerd, Amber van der","['Ruitenberg, M.F.L.', 'Hiele, K. van der']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"A high number (55-59%) of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) lose their job due to complex interactions between disease related factors, the working environment, job demands and personal factors. Identifying factors that will help provide a sustainable and healthy working life is essential. Our aim was to examine the association between cognitive fatigue and work functioning. The study included 225 individuals with relapsing-remitting MS in paid employment (>12 hours a week) (75.6 % female, median age: 42.5 years, median EDSS: 2.0). Five multiple regression analyses were conducted while accounting for known correlates (age, gender, education, duration of disease, MSrelated disability, job type) to examine the relationship between both subjective and objective measures of cognitive fatigue and work functioning in employees with MS. Secondly, a correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between objective and subjective cognitive fatigue. Subjective cognitive fatigue is obtained by self-report questionnaires (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)/Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)) and objective cognitive fatigue is obtained by using a neuropsychological test, the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). The outcome variables are (1) current work ability compared to lifetime's best measured by the Work Ability Index (WAI) and (2) work functioning measured by the 4 subscales of the Work Role Functioning Questionnaire-2 (WRFQ-2). No association was found between objective cognitive fatigue and work functioning. An explanation could be that objective and subjective measures are often only weakly correlated with each other. A lower subjective cognitive fatigue (MFIS: β = -.18, p = .041; VAS: β = -.39, p = < .001) was associated with better work ability. No association was found between subjective cognitive fatigue and the 4 subscales of the WRFQ-2 measuring work functioning. Lastly, no association was found between objective cognitive fatigue and subjective cognitive fatigue. In conclusion, subjective cognitive fatigue was associated with self-reported work ability in persons with relapsing-remitting MS with mild disability, while objective cognitive fatigue was not associated with self-reported work functioning. Further research should focus on objective measures of work functioning and other objective measures of cognitive fatigue.","['MS', 'Work', 'cognitive fatigue']"
Ik zeg niets: Een studie naar kwaliteit van leven bij adolescenten met selectief mutisme.,"Kuit, Sanne",['Nikki Nibbering'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"In the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, selective mutism is classified as an anxiety disorder. Literature has shown that there is a strong overlap between social anxiety and selective mutism. Social anxiety is known to be related to a lower quality of life. A lower quality of life is associated with stress and depression and an increased risk of medical problems. This study aims to gain a clearer picture of what is more important in an adolescent's quality of life: selective mutism, social anxiety, or low speech behaviour. 79 adolescents aged from 10 to 18 and one of their parents completed various questionnaires. Adolescents completed subscale C of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) and the domain psychological well-being of the Kidscreen-52. Parents completed the Selective Mutism Questionnaire (SMQ) and a short questionnaire that showed whether or not an adolescent has selective mutism. Significantly less speaking behavior has been reported in adolescents with selective mutism than without selective mutism (t(78) = -12.28, p<.001). In addition, significantly more social anxiety was found in adolescents with selective mutism than in adolescents without (t(78) = 9.19, p < .001). A significantly lower quality of life was found in adolescents with selective mutism than in adolescents without selective mutism (t(78) = -2.71, p = .010). The association between speaking behavior and social anxiety turned out to be significant (r = -.77, p<.001), the association between social anxiety and quality of life aswell (r = -.33, p<.001) and the association between speaking behavior and quality of life was also significant (r = .30, p = .01). The variables have been shown to be related to each other but not to have a significantly unique contribution to the quality of life of adolescents. Selective mutism as well as social anxiety and a low level of speaking behavior lead to a lower quality of life. More research is needed to further expand the picture of selective mutism and quality of life.","['Selective mutism', 'quality of life', 'kwaliteit van leven', 'sociale angst', 'selectief mutisme']"
"Climate change and conflict through the lens of Political Ecology: a case study of the farmer-herder conflict in Laikipia, Kenya","Kruizinga, Imke","['Tsagkroni, V.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyses the role of political factors in conflict arising from climate change through a single case study of the farmer-herder conflict in Laikipia, Kenya. A better understanding of climate change and conflict is necessary, as there is no clear consensus among scholars. This thesis uses political ecology that states that political factors, such as politicised ethnicity, access to land tenure, and perception of identity have a direct influence on conflict. It criticises the environmental scarcity theory, which states that resource scarcity due to climate change directly influences conflict. Mixed methods are used to analyse the role of political factors. The process tracing method is used to test whether power relations in politics influence conflict and the qualitative content analysis method is used to support process tracing by providing inside into the political factors presented in three major Kenyan newspapers. The results show that perception of identity, access to land tenure, and politicised ethnicity all contribute to a negative impact on the ability of pastoralists to access and influence the distribution of resources. This causes the competition for resources to become violent. The findings also show there is indirect link between climate change and conflict. These findings are in line with political ecology theory. Therefore, this thesis contributes to the theory and discussion in the literature about climate change and conflict.","['Conflict', 'Climate Change', 'Africa', 'Kenya', 'Laikpia', 'farmer-herder conflict', 'political factors']"
The Influence of Mastery and General Cognitive Functioning on the Relation Between Concerns About Falling and Falling in Older Adults,"Reus, Noëlle de","['Ruitenberg, M. F. L.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background – Each year, over 100,000 older adults (older than 65 years) are admitted to hospitals across the Netherlands after falling. Fall risk is influenced by physiological factors like impaired mobility and age, as well as (neuro-)psychological factors like concerns about falling, mastery – perception of control of own life – and general cognitive functioning. The extent to which these factors interact towards fall risk is unknown, thus this thesis studied the influence of concerns about falling, mastery, and general cognitive functioning on fall risk. Methods – A sample of 1313 older adults (49.1% male; age range 65-89 years) participated in a 3- year longitudinal study. Participants were assessed at baseline on concerns about falling (Falls Efficacy Scale), mastery (Pearlin Mastery Scale), and on general cognitive functioning (Mini Mental State Exam). Participants completed fall calendars for three years where they reported falls. For those reporting one or more falls during the follow up, the time to first fall in weeks was calculated. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted on concerns about falling, mastery and general cognitive functioning, with fall risk as outcome variable. These models were also fitted with interaction terms of concerns about falling and mastery, and concerns about falling and general cognitive functioning. All models were fitted unadjusted and adjusted for covariates, such as age, sex, and fall history. Results – Results showed that more concerns about falling increased fall risk (HR = 1.049, 95% CI [1.034-1.065], p < .001), but this effect disappeared in the adjusted model. Higher mastery (HR = 0.955, 95% CI [0.934, 0.976], p < .001) decreased fall risk in our sample and this remained after adjustment (HR = 0.975, 95% CI [0.950, 0.999], p = .043). General cognitive functioning did not significantly predict fall risk in our sample, neither did the interaction terms. Discussion – Mastery decreased fall risk, even after adjustment for covariates. This suggests mastery may be relevant in interventions aimed at decreasing fall risk. These interventions can focus on learning, decision-making, discovering of barriers and risk-management assessment. More mastery-increasing interventions can be developed. In this study, cognitive functioning was assessed in a broad and general way. Future research can focus on assessing the influence of different, specific cognitive functions which may give other or more subtle information.","['Mastery, General Cognitive Functioning, Concerns about Falling, Falling, Fear of Falling']"
Exploring Predictors of Intention to Use Digital Tools for Brain Health,"Switajska, Anna","['Jennifer Becker', 'Leonie Visser', 'Tanja de Rijke']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Developed countries are currently facing the trend of aging societies, which leads to citizens being more prone to diseases, such as Alzheimer’s. Based on the amount of time and money that care of patients with dementia costs every year, growing numbers of people with this condition, are expected to put significant pressure on the healthcare system. One of the strategies to approach this crisis is digitalization. This study aimed to identify significant predictors for the behavioral intention (BI) to use digital tools (DT) for brain health, focusing on mobile device proficiency, technology acceptance, health literacy, and motivation to change lifestyle and health behaviors for dementia risk reduction, while controlling for age. Four DT (ADappt, MijnBreincoach, cCog, and Neurokeys) were analyzed separately due to their unique functions and designs. The study hypothesized that health literacy and motivation to change lifestyle and health behaviors for dementia risk reduction would predict BI, as would mobile device proficiency and technology acceptance, while age would influence these relationships. The sample included 507 participants, spanning ages 20 to 89. Data was collected through an online questionnaire measuring the aforementioned variables. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the Health Model, including motivation to change lifestyle and health behaviors for dementia risk reduction and health literacy, significantly predicted the willingness to use most of the studied tools. High motivation to change lifestyle and health behaviors for dementia risk reduction (DRR) was associated with lower BI. Which might have been caused by the lack of direct influence of these tools on DRR. The Technology Model, involving mobile device proficiency and technology acceptance, significantly predicted behavioral intention to use cCog, web based diagnostic tool. Age moderated the relationships within the Technology Model for cCog, with mobile device proficiency being more relevant for older participants and technology acceptance for younger participants. Overall, this exploratory study sheds light on the factors influencing behavioral intention to use digital tools for brain health. These findings contribute to understanding the barriers and facilitators of adopting digital tools for brain health, potentially informing strategies to increase their implementation among the general public.","[""Azlaheimer's, health care, digigitalisation, intention to use""]"
Self-Love in the AOD Recovery Context: Exploring an Other-Focused Narrative to Loving the Self,"Manthey, Hanna",['Kelly Lynn Ziemer'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Popular science literature on self-love frequently portrays individuals as self-sufficient entities. This furthers a neoliberal narrative of self-optimization and stigmatization of help-seeking. Drawing on social media discourse among people within alcohol and other drug (AOD) recovery, this study aims to explore an alternative narrative of self-love that involves the other instead of centering around the self. The paper extends a larger project assessing lay beliefs of self-love in 902 #selflove and AOD recovery Instagram and Twitter posts from 2019 by focusing on one aspect of self-love: self-care strategies. This study examines the relationship between other-focused (e.g., seeking or offering help) as opposed to self-centered self-care strategies (e.g., cognitive reframing). Additionally, the mention of three common self-care strategies—namely expressing gratitude, reframing, and taking responsibility—to predict other-focused self-care in a post is assessed. Results from a chi-square analysis indicate no significant association between self-centered and other-focused self-care. Further, our regression model did not significantly predict other-focused self-care, calling for further exploration. Future research calls for a refined conceptualization and associated detection criteria of self- and other-focused care. This study provides a first step toward exploring a narrative of self-love rooted in solidarity and cooperation. As such, it adds to a growing body of work clarifying for those in recovery, practitioners, and researchers how self-love can be implemented in behavioral treatment and recovery interventions and promote AOD prevention.","['self-love', 'self-care', 'Alcohol and other drug recovery', 'social media', 'neoliberalism']"
Unveiling Parallel Pathways: Bridging the Gap between Structure and Reinforcement Learning: Utilizing the structure of the tasks and employing reinforcement learning strategies.,"Ince, Selin","['Wurm, F.R.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study aimed to investigate the link between reinforcement learning and structure learning. Reinforcement learning is a framework where humans learn to make decisions by interacting with their environment, receiving rewards or punishments based on their actions, with the goal of maximizing cumulative reward over time. While structure learning is the cognitive process by which individuals acquire and internalize the underlying organizational principles or structures of information. It enables individuals to perceive patterns, rules, and relationships, allowing for effective organization and comprehension of knowledge. In the context of the environment, structure learning involves the representation and understanding of stimulus or action-outcome associations within one's surroundings. By recognizing and learning the environmental structure, individuals can better navigate, anticipate, and respond to stimuli, optimizing their interactions and adapting their behaviours accordingly. The link could be shown by the presence of a cognitive module, between reinforcement and structure learning. The cognitive module refers to the mental processes involved in acquiring, processing, and using information. Participants completed three tasks, as they are a good representation of reinforcement learning and structure learning, as well as, learning and decision-making, and have been shown to be reliably linked to e.g., specific neural correlates. The tasks are the two-stage bandit task, the weather prediction task, and the credit assignment task, Participants performed above chance in all three tasks. Interestingly, we found significant correlations between central (performance) metrics between tasks. The main analysis using Pearson correlation revealed significant correlations between the credit assignment task and the two-stage bandit task, as well as between the credit assignment task and the weather prediction task. There was only a marginal correlation between the weather prediction task and the two-stage bandit task, which disappeared after controlling for shared variance with the credit assignment task using partial correlation. The findings indicate that reinforcement learning and structure learning share common variances and behavioural metrics, such as reaction time, accuracy, performance, and outcome, suggesting a link between the two forms of learning and supporting the presence of a shared cognitive module underlying these processes. This has implications that structure learning seems to be a promising link between different learning tasks, highlighting its importance for understanding learning and decision-making across different contexts and across individuals.","['structure learning', 'reinforcement learning', 'credit assignment', 'two-stage-bandit-task', 'weatherprediction task']"
"Exploring the Relationship between Contraceptive Method, Disordered Eating, and Past Mental Health Problems: A Mediation Analysis","du Preez, Zuzanne","['Proppert, R.K.K.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: The relationship between contraceptive use, past mental health problems, and current disordered eating behaviors is an emergent area of exploration in behavioral health research. With the evolution of contraceptive methods over time, understanding their potential interplay with mental health conditions is pivotal, especially among younger populations, for whom reproductive decisions and disordered eating behaviors are most prevalent. Objective: This exploratory study sought to determine if contraceptive use has an influence on current disordered eating behaviors and if past mental health problems serve as a mediating factor in this relationship. Methods: A nationally representative sample of students from occupational, applied science, and university institutions was utilized. Employing a cross-sectional design, extensive baseline data were collected through questionnaires. Respondents were classified into hormonal oral contraception and non-hormonal contraception groups. Mediation analyses were conducted to ascertain if any direct or indirect effects of contraceptive use on disordered eating behaviors were mediated through past mental health problems. Results: The mediation analyses did not identify significant direct or indirect effects of contraceptive use on current disordered eating behaviors through the lens of past mental health problems. Influential factors shaping the relationship between the studied variables included age, social support, and cognitive and behavioral coping mechanisms. No evidence was found to suggest past mental health issues mediated the connection between contraceptive use and current disordered eating. Limitations: The cross-sectional design of the study hampers causation or directional conclusions. The broad categorization of contraceptive methods and the aggregate scoring for past mental health problems may obfuscate specific influences. Relying on self-reported data also raises concerns of potential biases like recall and social desirability biases. Conclusion: This exploratory study offers an in-depth assessment of the proposed relationships between contraceptive use, past mental health conditions, and disordered eating behaviors in a student demographic. Although no significant associations were unearthed, the findings should be interpreted with circumspection due to the study's inherent constraints. Future research should emphasize longitudinal frameworks, delve into the granularities of contraceptive types and mental health conditions, and encompass more diverse cohorts to foster a richer understanding of these complex interrelationships.","['Eating disorder', 'oral contraception', 'mental health']"

Financial strain and its relationship to the chronical physical stress response: A meta-analysis.,"Bos, Danique van den",['Prof.dr. J.F. Brosschot'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Financial strain is associated with negative health consequences. The physical health risks seem to be related to the physical chronic stress response and its impacts. The Generalized Unsafety Theory of Stress (GUTS) provides an explanation for persistent of stress responses, namely a continuous sense of unsafety. We hypothesized that people with increased financial strain have a higher physical, chronic stress response, than people without or with low financial strain. Blood pressure was used here as a biomarker to measure the physical chronic stress response. Objective: The aim of this thesis was to investigate whether financial strain is associated with an increased chronic physical stress response, measured as high levels of blood pressure, compared to individuals with no or low levels of financial strain. Method: The method used is a meta-analysis in which, using an elaborated keyword profile and several inclusion criteria, 8 studies were selected in Web of Science. The effects sizes of the studies were converted to odds ratio, and we used the program CMA to run the analysis. Results: The association of financial strain on blood pressure was positive and significant (z = 2.022, p = 0.022, two-sided). Moderator analyses showed a significant association of objective financial strain (z = 2.247, p = 0.012, two-tailed) with blood pressure but not of subjective financial strain (z = -0.142, p = 0.887), and showed a significant association of self-reported blood pressure with financial strain (z = 1.761, p = 0.0183 two-tailed) but not of physical measurements of blood pressure (z = 0.800, p = 0.212, two-tailed). Conclusion: The findings strongly suggest that chronic stress levels, measured by blood pressure, are higher in people with high financial strain than in those without or with low financial strain. This seemed to be especially the case when financial strain was assessed objectively. Since it is unlikely that high blood pressure can cause financial strain, the results may be interpreted as financial strain causing high blood pressure on the long term.",
Workplace Bullying and Mental Health in Nurse Populations – A Meta-Analysis,"Schumacher, Lucia Katharina",['Marc Molendijk'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Aim: Considering the vital role of nurses in healthcare, especially amidst the light of the COVID-19 pandemic and an aging society, understanding the implications of workplace bullying becomes crucial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to summarize the cross-sectional literature on the association between workplace bullying and mental health in nurses. Methods: A systematic review of 37 relevant articles out of 8458 identified was conducted, using a random-effects model for statistical analysis, alongside assessments of moderating factors. Results: The cross-sectional data showed a positive association between workplace bullying and mental health issues (r = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.418 – 0.53, p < 0.001, k = 40), more specifically depression, anxiety, burnout, stress-related complaints, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and general mental health complaints. In this study, r represents Pearson’s correlation coefficient, 95% CI signifies the 95% confidence interval, p the significance level and k denotes the number of studies. Geographic differences in the data, (r = - 0.01, CI = -0.06 – 0.04, p = 0.61, k = 40) and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (r = 0.05, CI = -0.09 – 0.19, p = 0.51, k = 32) were not associated with an impact on the association between workplace bullying and mental health.

To trust or not to trust: No apparent effect of communicating different magnitudes of epistemic uncertainty on perceptions of trust in the source,"Stoltenhoff, Immanuel",['Sanne Willems'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"There is an ongoing debate about whether and how to communicate the epistemic uncertainty of scientific findings. In this debate, skeptics that shy away from communicating uncertainty measures of their work, commonly name loss of trust in scientists and the information they produce as important arguments. Efforts to provide clarity in this discussion, generated insight on many aspects of epistemic uncertainty but the effect of different magnitudes, or sizes of epistemic uncertainty has rarely been the subject of studies. To collect evidence on the nature of the relationship between different magnitudes of communicated uncertainty in science and the trust scientific laymen have in the source of information, this study presents respondents to a survey (N = 235) with one of three magnitudes of uncertainty (no uncertainty, low uncertainty, or high uncertainty) across three different formats (verbal, numerical, and visual) and measures their trust in the source of information. No association was found between magnitude and trust in the source. Furthermore, exploration of the data revealed no interaction between the format and the magnitude of epistemic uncertainty on trust in the source. This study’s limitations in representability and validity restrict strong conclusions. Future research should ensure that participants comprehend what high or low magnitudes of uncertainty are in the context of scientific findings, so participants’ comprehension of the magnitudes is increased and hence also the meaningfulness of judgments they make based on them.","['epistemic uncertainty', 'uncertainty magnitude', 'trust', 'epistemic trustworthiness', 'survey', 'scientific laypeople']"

De rol van fantasie in Playful Sport Design: Over de inhoud en effecten van het gebruik van fantasie tijdens het sporten,"Swart, Esther","['Vries, J.D. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Aangezien de helft van de Nederlanders onvoldoende beweegt, is het van belang om nieuwe manieren te vinden om plezier te vinden in het sporten, waardoor de sportmotivatie vergroot. Het gebruik van Playful Sport Design (PSD) (Verwijmeren et al., 2023) biedt nieuwe mogelijkheden in het speels inrichten van sporttrainingen, en het gebruik van fantasie tijdens sporten is een belangrijk element van PSD waar nog nauwelijks onderzoek naar gedaan is. In dit onderzoek werd daarom gekeken naar (1) of er onderliggende thema’s te vinden zijn in het gebruik van fantasie tijdens sporten, (2) of het gebruik van fantasie het sportplezier en hierdoor de motivatie vergroot, en (3) of het gebruik van fantasie voor meer sportplezier en -motivatie zorgt wanneer iemand al fantasievol is vergeleken met iemand die niet fantasievol is. Dit werd gedaan met behulp van een dagboekstudie, waarbij door de respondenten (die minstens twee keer per week sportten) gedurende één maand elke week een vragenlijst over hun sportervaringen ingevuld diende te worden. De onderliggende thema´s werden geanalyseerd met behulp van inductieve analyse, en uit de resultaten bleek dat variatie/creativiteit, visualisatie met competitieve elementen en visualisatie van doelen de grootste thema’s waren in het gebruik van fantasie. Verder werd het voorgestelde gemodereerde mediatiemodel (gebruikt voor het testen van hypothese 2 en 3) door regressieanalyses in PROCESS (model 7) (Hayes, 2013) niet bevestigd, maar er werd wel aangetoond dat het gebruik van fantasie (1) direct leidt tot meer sportmotivatie en (2) leidt tot meer trainingsplezier wanneer iemand fantasievol is. Het speels gebruik maken van fantasie binnen sporttrainingen is daarom een mogelijke manier om plezier en sportmotivatie te vergroten. Binnen de sportpsychologie heeft dit onderwerp veel potentie, en meer onderzoek zou moeten volgen.","['Fantasie, Playful Sport Design, Trainingsplezier, Sportmotivatie']"
"The Effect of Novelty on Free Recall, Recognition, and Delayed Memory Task","Narmania, Ana Na","['Vogelsang, D.A.,Dr']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research paper aimed to investigate the effect of a novel environment on memory consolidation in healthy participants. Using virtual reality, the study exposed participants to two distinct environments and assessed their performance on a subsequent word-learning tasks. The goal was to determine if exploring a novel environment would lead to better memory outcomes compared to a familiar environment. The results of the study failed to support two of the three hypotheses and found no statistically significant differences in memory performance between the prior exposure to novel and familiar environment in the free recall, recognition, or delayed memory tasks. These results suggest that the environment in which information is learned does not have a significant impact on memory consolidation. The literature on the relationship between novelty and memory consolidation is mixed, some studies have found that a novel environment improves memory consolidation, while others have found no significant effect. The results of the study may be influenced by the type of novelty manipulated, the memory tasks used, the duration of the that further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between these variables. Additional studies can help to clarify the mechanism of how novelty affects memory and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon.",

Decision-making processes can get affected by countless various factors such as gender, age, personality traits, empathy… However, what still remains unclear about decision-making is how these various factors affect the decision-making process and each other especially in a conflict scenario. This paper investigates decision-making in an asymmetric conflict scenario, specifically Machiavellianism and its relationship with aggression. Our hypothesis proposed that the relationship between Machiavellianism and Attacker’s Aggression would be positively correlated. The relationship between these variables was tested in an online decision-making experiment called the Attacker and Defender Contest. In the experiment; both sides had to decide how much to invest in either attacking or defending based on their role. Both the attacker and defender’s decisions at the end affected the reward amount that they would receive. After running the experiment, the data was analyzed. The alternative hypothesis was rejected due to insignificant results and negligibly small effect sizes. The null-findings’ possible reasons were discussed under the topics of publication bias, confirmation bias, external distractions, confounding variables. The paper concluded that a laboratory setting, controlling external distractions and taking confounding variables into consideration is important for future research.","['decision-making, asymmetric conflict scenario, Attacker and Defender contest, Machiavellianism, aggression…']"
Males vs. Females in the Transfer Attacker-Defender Contest,"Hene, Wilma",['Lennart Reddmann'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Appeasement has been both beneficial and risky in asymmetrical conflicts. Appeasement as a response to the threat of aggression can be a successful strategy by containing aggression but can also be exploited by the opposing party. However, research is lacking in the field of whether gender differences influence behaviour towards appeasement. Males have been shown to be more risk-taking and use more costly aggression compared to females. Gender may therefore be influential to behaviour in conflicts involving appeasing effects. This paper explores the behaviour of male and female attackers' aggression in asymmetrical conflict through a transfer attacker-defender contest (TAD-C). We hypothesized that aggression would decrease with increasing levels of transfer, and that males would respond more aggressively to increasing levels of transfer than females. The strategy method was used where 279 participants were assigned an attacker or defender role. Attackers first received a transfer of Monetary Units (MU) at seven different levels from the defender, in addition to the initial 30 MU. Based on this, they decided on a conflict investment toward the defender. Lastly, attackers declared their expected investment from defenders. Attackers’ aggression was measured based on their conflict investment to seven levels of transfer. The repeated measures analysis of variance conveyed there were no significant differences between male and female attacker aggression toward increasing levels of transfers from the defending party. In conclusion, no significant gender differences in behaviour towards appeasement were found. Thus, the study questions whether gender differences exist in appeasement conflicts and decision making practices.","['Asymmetrical conflict, aggression, appeasement, gender differences']"

In dit onderzoek is er gekeken naar de rol van Playful Sport Design (PSD) als proactieve cognitief-gedragsmatige manier om een sporttraining met behulp van plezierige- en competitie elementen in te richten. De steekproef bestaat uit zowel mannen (n = 40) als vrouwen (n = 78) boven de achttien jaar die minstens een keer per week sporten. In deze studie zijn er een vijftal vragenlijsten opgestuurd waarvan de respondenten iedere week gevraagd werd deze in te vullen. Zo kon er gekeken worden naar het effect van PSD op self-efficacy en doelprogressie. En daarbij de mate van uitdaging als mediërende factor voor de relatie tussen PSD en self-efficacy en tussen PSD en doelprogressie. Op basis van literatuur werd er verwacht dat er een positieve relatie bestaat voor PSD en self-efficacy en doelprogressie. Lineaire regressie analyses laten zien dat deze verwachting klopt. Dit betekent dat hoe meer een sporter PSD toepast in zijn/haar training, hoe meer geloof in eigen kunnen er bestaat en hoe meer er een gevoel bestaat van het behalen van doelen. Ook werd er verwacht dat ‘uitdaging’ voor beide relaties een mediërende factor is. Met behulp van de SPSS-extensie PROCESS werd dit onderzocht en bleek de mate van uitdaging inderdaad de relatie tussen PSD en doelprogressie te mediëren. Hoe meer PSD wordt toegepast, hoe meer uitdaging er bestaat en hoe meer het gevoel bestaat van het behalen van doelen. Daarentegen geldt uitdaging niet als mediatie bij PSD en selfefficacy, hier is mogelijk een ander mechanisme verantwoordelijk. Uit deze studie blijkt dat PSD bij kan dragen aan verhoogde prestatie en geloof in eigen kunnen wat betreft sportprestaties.","['Playful Sport Design (PSD)', 'self-efficacy', 'doelprogressie', 'uitdaging', 'proactiviteit']"
Testing a Product Repositioning Nudge in a Supermarket in a Deprived Area in the Netherlands,"Donkers, Marloes","['Van Bekerom, L.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. Having an unhealthy diet and its consequences are a pressing, public health issue and diet quality follows a socio-economic gradient. A factor that contributes to health disparities is the food environment and people with low socio-economic status (SES) get exposed to less healthy food environments. However, most policies are targeted towards individuals, while especially people with low SES are influenced by biases and heuristics. Moreover, their cognitive capacity is taxed by scarcity-related stressors. Nudging is frequently proposed as a solution to improve health behaviours, especially in relation to food consumption. A well tested nudge in the general population is a product repositioning nudge. However, this nudge is not tested among people with low SES in particular. Therefore, the main objective of the study is to examine whether people with low SES can benefit from a product repositioning nudge. Additionally, the study aims to test whether the nudge-effect is guided by the presence of a retail display at a register. Methods. To examine the effect of a repositioning nudge and if the effect was guided by the presence of a display, sales data were collected for the control condition during a 4-week baseline phase (N = 28), and during a 4-week the nudge phase (N = 28). For exploratory analyses the study collected data about demographics, consumer behaviour, attitude towards healthy eating and (financial) concerns of participants (N = 90) via a cross-sectional questionnaire. As well as sales data on unhealthy items during both phases. Results. The nudge was found to be effective, however, the displays did not guide the effect. There was no effect found in the nudge phase on the sales of unhealthy items and no significant difference in sales per register. There was no significant predictor found for how often someone buys a snack at the register. Conclusion. The current study highlights the effectiveness of a product repositioning nudge in promoting a healthy diet among people with low SES and that the effect was not guided by the presence of a display. This emphasizes the role of the environment in guiding behaviour and suggests that a subtle change can have significant effects on behaviour.","['Nudging, health disparities, SES, diet quality, policies']"

The psychological mechanisms underlying health behaviour change in microdosing,"Woermann, Ella","['Prochazkova, L.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The practice of microdosing (taking small amounts of psychedelics) has been found to affect neurochemistry without causing hallucinogenic effects. This allows for daily use that can enhance cognition, mood, and overall wellness without negatively impacting normal cognitive function. It has been proposed that microdosing may also positively impact health behaviours such as improving dietary habits, increasing exercise frequency or quitting smoking. In this cross-sectional exploratory study, we sought to identify the health behaviours that were most commonly reported as changing after microdosing. Additionally, we aimed to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving these changes and examine the influence of set and setting on the outcomes. 365 individuals who engage in adult microdosing completed an online survey questionnaire to share their personal experiences with the practice. Additionally, 21 microdosing coaching practitioners were asked to complete a similar questionnaire. The two most frequently reported changes in health behaviours by both the users and practitioners were sleep and contemplative/mindfulness practices. Emotion regulation, psychological flexibility, and resilience were the three most often reported psychological mechanisms underlying the health behaviour changes. Moreover, the environment and mentality during psychedelic experiences impacted the outcome. The study found that incorporating other behavioural strategies alongside microdosing and practicing mindfulness had a significant correlation with improved health behaviours. Further research is needed to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie health behaviour change and what the exact relationship these psychological factors have with the health behaviours.",

Brizi'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Food waste is a serious global matter. Various studies have investigated factors that influence individuals’ food waste intentions. Earlier studies suggest that environmental knowledge is positively correlated with pro-environmental behaviour and negative attitudes and beliefs towards food waste. In this study we investigate whether more environmental knowledge is associated with less household food waste, and to what extent country of residence moderates this relationship. Using a cross-national survey conducted with 210 respondents originating from Belgium and the United States, we found that individuals who possess more environmental knowledge do not significantly waste less food. Nonetheless, country of residence does significantly play a role in the extent to which people waste food. Residents from the U.S. do not intend to waste more or less food regardless of their level of environmental knowledge. In contrast, Belgian residents do show to waste less when environmental knowledge is high and vice versa. Lastly, limitations in the study and future research are discussed.","['Environmental knowledge, Food waste, Cross-national survey']"
Stay positive! – Persistent positivity bias in social learning across development,"Wicinski, Kathrin Marie","['van der Molen, M.J.W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social feedback can influence how we feel about ourselves, and previous studies have shown that adults preferentially incorporate positive social feedback into their perception of themselves. Such an optimism bias might contribute to good mental health and could help to explain mood and anxiety disorders. Although adolescence is a period of increased risk for psychopathology, only little is known about how adolescents update their self-feelings when receiving social feedback. This study investigated how adults and adolescents adjust their self-feelings after social feedback (i.e., affective updating) using the SELF-speech paradigm. In addition, we recorded EEG during the task to measure theta (4-8 Hz) reactivity to feedback. Theta activity has previously been associated with negative feedback. Under the assumption, that adolescents would be more sensitive to negative social feedback, we expected to see stronger EEG theta activity in adolescents. During the SELF-speech task, seventy-two adolescents (12-17 years old) and 175 adults (18-25 years old) unexpectedly had to perform a short speech in front of three judges. After the speech participants evaluated themselves on 80 items and were presented feedback from three judges on these same items on a trial-to-trial basis. Following the judge’s feedback participants indicated how they felt about themselves. Using an adapted form of the Rescorla-Wagner model, we could observe age differences in affective updating. The results indicate a persistent positivity bias throughout development with an increase in learning from negative feedback during adulthood. The EEG results indicate no differences for valence our age in theta activity. However, we observed a trend towards a developmental decrease in theta reactivity to feedback regardless of valence. Together, these findings suggest that while the positivity bias prevails from adolescents to adulthood, it seems to weaken towards adulthood. Further, possible age differences in theta reactivity to feedback cannot be explained by valence.","['Social Feedback, Reinforcement Learning, Adults, Adolescents, Positivity Bias, Theta Activity']"
The Association between Academic Stress and Sleep Quality in Students Considering Caffeine Consumption and Timing of Caffeine Use,"Sotelo Lazaro, Katherine Yoeli",['Dr. J.F van den Berg'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Sleep is fundamental for a healthy lifestyle, yet people commonly report problems regarding sleep quality. Poor sleep quality is also a frequent issue among college students. Sleep quality can be affected by various factors, including stress and the consumption of specific substances like caffeine. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the connections between caffeine consumption, caffeine time use, academic stress, and sleep quality. This study also investigated possible moderating roles of caffeine consumption and timing of caffeine consumption in the relationship between stress and sleep quality, as well as the evening caffeine use in the association between caffeine consumption and sleep quality. Data were gathered from 315 participants (78.4% female, mean age 20.8 years, SD = 2.52) in March 2020. Respondents completed online questionnaires, including the Law Student Perceived Stress Scale to measure stress levels, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to measure sleep quality, and self-reporting questions about caffeine, alcohol, and cannabis consumption. Multiple regression analyses with interactions were performed. A negative association between stress and sleep quality was found, indicating that more stress is related to poorer sleep quality; however, there was no association between stress and caffeine use, nor between caffeine and sleep quality. Furthermore, there was no evidence of moderation in any of the relationships. It appears that among college students, the relationship between stress and sleep quality may be influenced by other substances rather than caffeine itself. More investigation is warranted to provide clarity on the inconsistencies in the existing literature. Future research can focus on exploring the advantages of online interventions for students experiencing poor sleep quality.","['stress', 'caffeine', 'sleep', 'students']"
Rejection Sensitivity as a Predictor of Social Feedback Processing from a Developmental Perspective,"Saarela, Heidi","['Saygin, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Receiving social feedback from others influences one’s self-view through social feedback processing. Healthy people tend to have a positivity bias toward social feedback, but many factors can influence social feedback processing leading to a negativity bias. Rejection sensitivity (RS) is characterized by a habit of anxiously expecting rejection with a heightened attunement. RS is often coupled with an intense reaction which is common in individuals with borderline personality symptoms. In this paper, the level of RS and developmental stage, adolescents versus adults, is predicted to influence positive and negative learning levels from feedback. 144 adults and 74 adolescents performed an impromptu speech whilst alleged judges were evaluating their performance. The participants completed self-evaluations, received feedback from the judges, and further evaluated how they felt about themselves and their performance. Affective updating, referring to the change in feelings about the self in response to feedback, was modeled using an adapted learning model. The level of RS did not predict the level of positive or negative learning rates, contrary to most previous research findings. Generally high RS has been found to pose a vulnerability to hypervigilance toward negative feedback. In comparison to adolescents, adults showed higher negative learning rates, in contrast to the general theoretical understanding of adolescents being more sensitive to social feedback. The findings suggest that future research should include additional constructs like emotion regulation, depression, and self-esteem, to investigate their influence on learning from feedback in different developmental stages.","['Rejection sensitivity', 'Social learning', 'Adolescence', 'Development']"

Our experiment consisted of an online quiz where participants performed a quiz alone, or in the presence of guardians. Furthermore, when in the presence of guardians, those guardians were either part of the participants’ ingroup or outgroup. Ingroup and outgroup were created through the manipulation of gender. Based on Routine Activity Theory, we expected cheating rates to be highest in the condition without guardians. Moreover, we expected cheating rates to be higher in the ingroup condition compared to the outgroup condition. We did not find significant differences across the conditions in our experiment. For future research, changing our method to create stronger manipulations of the different conditions should be considered.","['social psychology, criminology, Routine Activity Theory']"

Emotion Recognition in Children: is there a Concordance between Self-reported and Observer-reported ratings of Emotions?,"Spiekerman, Fenna","['Riddell, C.D.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Emotion recognition is an important skill for individuals to acquire, leading to effective communication and smooth social interactions. While previous research has extensively studied emotion recognition in childhood, many of these studies are limited by the use of non-authentic expressions produced by actors and assuming a direct correspondence between facial expressions and felt emotions, disregarding individual context. This study aimed to measure children’s emotion recognition using a more naturalistic approach by comparing self-reported and observer-reported emotions in children. In the first phase of the study, children (8 to 12 years old; N = 10) and adults (18 to 40 years old; N = 10) were filmed while watching emotion-inducing videos and self-reported their emotional experiences. In the second phase, a separate group of children (8 to 12 years old; N = 15) rated the expressed emotions of the participants from the first phase of the study. The concordance between self-reported and observer-reported emotions was examined, with a focus on whether concordance differed across emotions and the age of the stimulus actors. The results indicated that children exhibited similar accuracy in recognizing happiness, sadness, fear and disgust. Additionally, children demonstrated an own age bias, which reflects a better emotion recognition accuracy for own-age faces compared to other-age faces. These findings highlight the importance of considering self-reported emotions and the age of the stimulus actors in understanding the development of emotion recognition. Further research should explore the underlying factors that influence emotion recognition in children using a naturalistic approach.","['emotion recognition', 'psychology', 'children']"

One major concern in women’s health is dysmenorrhea. Amongst many other aspects, it can disrupt their daily and quality of life. A sincere and effective intervention is critical, especially as early as possible. Puberty is a milestone in children's development, especially in their personality and autonomy, which emphasises the need to alleviate the pain and allow for a healthy life and development. A lack of understanding and research has led to little progression in these types of life-changing interventions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the data that is available is attested. This paper examines the replicability of the interaction effect of Anxiety and Depression on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). The replicability of this will be an indication of robustness. This was investigated through the implication of percentage dropout conditions (excluding 5%, 15% and 30%) as well as resampling conditions with the most central, the most extreme and a random resampling condition. The results revealed that the central subsampling condition was comparatively the most robust to the percentage dropout condition, indicating a genuine interaction effect. The variability of the extreme condition, and its influence which is also reflected in the random condition, signifies the importance of proceeding research with caution.",
Eating and Moving in Young Children with ASD: Are Parents Affected?,"Brühöfner, Amelie","['Chavez Arana, C.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have often shown issues in the domains of eating habits and physical activity. Many display food refusal and selectivity and engage in lower levels of physical activity than their typically developing peers. Moreover, parents of children with ASD have reported increased parenting stress in association with various symptoms of ASD. Aim. This study aims to investigate the relationship between ASD traits, eating habits, physical activity and parenting stress. It further explores if parenting stress is associated with eating habits and physical activity of children with ASD traits. Methods. Parents of 93 children filled out the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ-10) to screen for ASD, frequency questionnaires to measure eating and physical activity, and the Parenting Tax Questionnaire (OBVL-K) to measure parenting stress. Four separate multiple regression analysis were performed. Results. Results show no association between ASD traits and eating habits, physical activity and parenting stress. Neither physical activity, nor eating habits predicted parenting stress in parents of children with ASD traits. Conclusion. Overall, mild symptoms of ASD may not raise concerns about eating habits and physical activity in children. Parents of children with mild symptoms are generally not exposed to higher stress levels and are likely to not experience any distress related to the child’s eating habits and engagement in physical activity. Findings illustrate how problems specific to ASD are manifested differently along the spectrum. Future research should address the influence of ASD severity on the relationship between health habits and parenting stress.","['Autism Spectrum Disorder, Eating Habits, Physical Activity, Parenting Stress']"
Attention to Gender: Gender differences in the relationship between traits of ADHD and Cognitive Flexibility,"Schulten, Mare","['Jongkees, B.J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"ADHD is a well-known neurodevelopmental disorder that extends from childhood into adulthood for many individuals. Symptoms of ADHD can be categorized into three subtypes: hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity. Males typically exhibit more external symptoms, while females tend to display more internal symptoms, such as inattention. However, both genders are diagnosed using the same criteria, resulting in a higher rate of ADHD diagnosis among males. Our understanding of gender differences in the presentation of symptoms, particularly inattention, remains limited. However, exploring the concept of cognitive flexibility becomes relevant when examining inattention, as it encompasses the ability to adapt and shift one's thinking and behavior in response to changing circumstances or tasks. By considering cognitive flexibility, we can gain valuable insights into how inattention may impact individuals with ADHD and potentially contribute to gender differences in symptomatology. A total of 100 participants completed a computer-based task that assessed task-switching performance which measured reaction time and accuracy for switch cost and incongruent cost. A Multiple Regression Analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between gender, inattention, and task-switching performance. The results of the study did not yield statistically significant findings, indicating no substantial gender differences in task-switching performance and its association with inattention in individuals with ADHD. A few limitations of the study include a relatively small sample size and the possibility that females filled in the self- report questionnaire based on their presumption that they are less likely to have characteristics of ADHD. Future studies should focus on larger and more diverse samples to enhance the generalizability of the findings.","['ADHD', 'gender differences', 'inattention', 'task-switching performance']"

Interestingly, no gender differences were found when testing risk preferences with perceived financial scarcity, while a significant effect of gender was uncovered for the association between perceived financial scarcity and risk tolerance. The results of the study can hopefully provide more clarity regarding the differences between risk preference and risk tolerance, in addition to providing more information that could break down harmful gender stereotypes.","['risk', 'scarcity', 'gender']"

Door middel van een multiverse analyse is er opnieuw gekeken naar dit effect om te kijken hoe robuust het is tegen logische alternatieve routes. De resultaten toonden aan dat het effect relatief robuust is voor variaties in de scoreregels, de steekproefgrootte, het opnemen versus uitsluiten van bepaalde participanten en het toevoegen van covariabele in de analyses. Geen een van de 40 alternatieve paden bleek significant te zijn.

Het belang van opvoedstijl voor de mentale gezondheid van kinderen: De samenhang tussen ouderlijke warmte en depressie bij kinderen en de rol van empathie van het kind,"Salfeld, Lynn",['Marieke Tollenaar'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Depressie is één van de meest voorkomende psychische stoornissen onder jongeren en brengt vele risico’s en gevolgen met zich mee die de kwaliteit van het leven van de depressieve jongeren kunnen schaden. Om dit te voorkomen is er onderzoek nodig naar de risicofactoren van een depressie. Factoren die mogelijk een belangrijke rol spelen in de mentale gezondheid van kinderen, zijn zowel de mate van ouderlijke warmte die de kinderen ontvangen, als de mate van cognitieve empathie van het kind. De huidige studie onderzoekt of ouderlijke warmte een beschermende factor speelt tegen het ontwikkelen van depressieve klachten bij kinderen, en onderzoekt of de mate van cognitieve empathie van het kind hierin een mediërende rol speelt. De steekproef bestond uit 115 adolescenten (gemiddeld 15.80 jaar waarvan 37 jongens en 78 meisjes) vanuit een grotere studie over depressie, die binnen dit onderzoek drie vragenlijsten invulden over ervaren ouderlijke warmte, cognitieve empathie en depressieve klachten. Resultaten van de regressieanalyses laten zien dat ouderlijke warmte inderdaad negatief geassocieerd was aan depressieve klachten bij kinderen (β = -0.546, p <.001). Cognitieve empathie speelde echter geen significant mediërende rol binnen deze relatie. De resultaten suggereren dus dat een hoge mate van ouderlijke warmte een beschermende factor kan zijn tegen het ontwikkelen van depressieve klachten bij kinderen, maar de rol van (cognitieve) empathie hierin is nog niet duidelijk. De bevindingen van dit onderzoek bieden aanknopingspunten in het verbeteren van behandelstrategieën voor depressieve adolescenten, en benadrukken het belang van opvoedingsstrategieën die op populatieniveau gestimuleerd zouden kunnen worden.","['Depressie, opvoedstijl, empathie']"
Negative mood and motor adaptation in response to the virtual avatar: The effect of negative mood on performance and adaptability in a virtual environment: with potential influence of sense of agency and body ownership,"Kallansee, Roos",['J. M. Hall'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"People with a higher negative mood have been shown to perform worse on motor tasks, such as moving slower than healthy individuals. Dysfunctions depressed people experience in psychomotor areas imply restriction in movement and response times that may complicate performance on an action-based virtual reality (VR) task. Additionally, VR illusions body ownership and sense of agency were found to predict how well someone performs on a VR task. These illusions are found to be distorted in depressed people. They may therefore have a moderating effect on negative mood and VR performance. This study investigated the relationship of negative mood and performance on a motor adaptability task in VR. The four hypotheses were: negative mood can predict overall performance on a VR game; negative mood can predict motor adaptability to asynchronous events; and body ownership and sense of agency separately act as moderators between negative mood, overall performance, and adaptability. 70 participants performed a VR game and caught objects with an avatar arm. Asynchrony between the avatar and the real arm examined adaptability to mismatches. Participants filled in the BDI, body ownership and agency questionnaire. The results show that negative mood does not significantly predict overall performance nor adaptability. Body ownership is not a moderator. Sense of agency does show a moderating effect on overall performance, but not adaptability. This means that a higher negative mood might only affect performance in general when a distorted sense of agency is experienced, but asynchronous conditions can affect sense of agency equalizing adaptability scores.",
The Impact of Neuroticism on Motor Adaptability: Investigating the relationship between neuroticism and motor adaptability utilizing virtual reality technology,"Goes, Fleur van der","['Hall, J.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Neuroticism plays an enormous role in someone’s adaptability to unexpected and unfavorable events. Research on the influence of a neurotic personality profile on motor adaptability has not been conducted yet. However, preliminary findings show the impact of neurotic personality on affect, cognition, and the physical body, straining the healthcare system. The current study makes use of the Big Five Inventory (BFI) and a Virtual Reality (VR) game in which temporal and spatial asynchronies between participants and their VR avatars were present. This paper aims to find an answer to: What is the relationship between the degree of neuroticism and motor adaptability to the asynchrony of your VR avatar? The hypothesis states that neurotic character traits are related to lower motor adaptability. The effect of neuroticism score on motor adaptability to the presented mismatches is investigated among 70 participants. Experience with VR is included as a covariate. A hierarchical multiple linear regression using the “enter” command is executed within SPSS. Based on this, it can be concluded that a higher neuroticism score does not predict worse motor adaptability. Therefore, the hypothesis is rejected. Results also reveal no significant effect of VR experience. Taken together, the current study implies that the expression of a neurotic personality profile is not to be extended to motor aspects. More research is necessary, both to investigate motor effects using a different study design and to acquire knowledge on how to help neurotic individuals overcome challenges in life to diminish negative individual and societal outcomes.","['Neuroticism, Motor Adaptability, Virtual Reality, Asynchrony, Mismatch']"
Actions Speak Louder Than Values: Testing the Robustness of the Inaction-Driven Prejudice Increase Effect,"Weyler, Larissa","['McCormick, E.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Discrimination and prejudice are serious problems in our society. The desire for cognitive consistency is eminently influential on how such implicit and explicit attitudes translate into behavior and how attitudes change over different contexts. While it has been found that experiencing cognitive dissonance between discriminating behaviors and one’s values can lead to bias reduction, a recent study by Szekeres et al. (2022) also found the opposite: Inaction, or a failure to confront, in the face of witnessing prejudice, subsequently correlates with more discriminating attitudes. This effect was reported to be mediated by how much a person values confronting; it was specifically observed for respondents that valued confronting highly. The present paper aimed to test the robustness of this interaction of confronting importance with confronting behavior on attitude change across other subsamples. For this, three different resampling approaches instrumentalizing bootstrapping were employed that excluded different percentages of random respondents. The exclusions were either completely random or random within either extreme or central scoring participants. The comparison of the mean interaction coefficients and variances of the different resampling conditions showed that the mean interaction remained quite stable after resampling. Only excluding large percentages of extreme values led to somewhat of a drift to a larger interaction effect.","['Robustness', 'Interaction Effect', 'Prejudice']"

Sex differences in fMRI Alzheimer disease (AD) classification accuracy,"Kluge, Sarah","['Vos, F. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that impacts females substantially more than men. However, not much research has been conducted on the classification possibilities of functional MRI (fMRI) on the basis of sex, although fMRI may be a better classifier of AD in women as functional connectivity (FC) research has shown that women with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) show weaker connectivity in the hippocampal area as compared to males. This research investigated if 1) functional connectivity is a better classifier of AD for females compared to males and 2) the addition of functional connectivity to grey matter density for AD classification improves accuracy more for females than for males. The measures grey matter density (GMD), functional connectivity between brain regions (FC) and a combined model of the two measures predicted the classification of AD or control, analyzed separately for males (AD = 30, controls = 74) and females (AD = 46, controls = 99). This was done with a logistic regression analysis with LASSO penalty. The results found that, unlike expected, males increased their AUC value (AUC = 0.941) when the FC measure was combined with the GMD measure (AUC = 0.959). The females however showed a decrease in their AUC value (AUC = 0.876) when the FC measure was combined with the GMD measure (AUC = 0.860). The FC measure also had a higher AUC value on its own in males (AUC = 0.723) versus females (AUC = 0.626). This shows that the FC measure used in this research increases accuracy of AD classification in males and implies that fMRI is not a better classifier of Alzheimer in females and does not improve diagnosis when compared to solely using structural MRI (sMRI).","['AD', 'fMRI', 'sex differences', 'brain imaging', 'Alzheimer', 'grey matter density', 'functional connectivity']"

Recent onderzoek toont aan dat tijdens de COVID-19 pandemie de mentale gezondheid afgenomen was, vooral onder jongvolwassenen. Psychologische flexibiliteit kan echter mogelijk de negatieve impact bufferen, met name tijdens stressvolle periodes zoals een pandemie. In de huidige studie werd getest of de mentale gezondheid het laagst was tijdens de pandemie – in vergelijking met de periode ervoor en erna – en dat dit met name voor jongvolwassenen (18-32 jaar) het geval was, ten opzichte van volwassenen (33-62 jaar) en ouderen (63+ jaar). Daarnaast werd onderzocht of mensen met een hoge psychologische flexibiliteit een betere mentale gezondheid hebben dan mensen met een lage psychologische flexibiliteit, met name tijdens de pandemie in uitdagende tijden. In een herhaald cross-sectioneel ontwerp werd data verzameld in Nederland vóór (2018, n = 531), tijdens (2020 & 2021, n = 3813) en na de pandemie (2022 & 2023, n =2143). Jongvolwassenen hadden een verlaagde mentale gezondheid tijdens de pandemie, maar de gemiddelde mentale gezondheid van alle deelnemers tijdens de pandemie bleef verrassend stabiel. Na de pandemie had iedere leeftijdsgroep een hogere mentale gezondheid dan tijdens én voor de pandemie. De mogelijke bijdrage van psychologische flexibiliteit aan de mentale gezondheid was tijdens de pandemie even relevant als na de pandemie.

"The Sleep Trap: The Impact of Parental Stress, Physical Activity, and Screen Time on Sleep Problems in five-year-old Children","Szabo, Csilla","['Chavez Arana, C.L']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Sleep habits are among the most essential elements in a child's development. A variety of fundamental areas of a child's development, such as brain development, memory, acquiring new abilities, academic achievement, physical development, and physical health, are linked to sleep patterns (El-Sheikh & Sadeh, 2015). However, several factors, including physical activity (Bjørgen, 2016; Owens, 2005), screen use (Davis et al., 2004; Paavonen et al., 2006), and parental stress (Byars et al., 2011; Deater-Deckard, 2008) can have an impact on sleep habits. Aim: The purpose of this research is to determine if parental stress, children’s physical activity, and their screen use predict sleep problems in 5-year-old youngsters. Methods: Data of 4588 participants (51.7% female; mean age 5.1; SD=0.445) were used from the Cool Little Kids Project (CLKP). A multiple regression was conducted with parental stress, children’s physical activity, and screen use as predictors of sleep problems. The Parenting Tax Questionnaire was used to measure parental stress, and the Child Sleep Diagnosis List was used to measure sleep problems. Physical activity and screen use were assessed with questions designed for the CLKP. Results: Parental stress (β = 0.137), children’s physical activity (β = -0.053), and their screen use (β = 0.052) predicted sleep problems with small effect sizes. Conclusion: Increased physical activity was linked to less sleeping problems, whereas higher levels of screen use and parental stress predicted greater levels of sleep issues.",
Classificatie van de ziekte van Alzheimer bij mannen en vrouwen op basis van structurele MRI-scans: Het onderzoeken van geslachtsverschillen in classificatie-accuratesse van verschillende structurele MRI-maten voor de ziekte van Alzheimer,"Kuiper, Sterre","['Vos, F. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het accuraat diagnosticeren van de ziekte van Alzheimer (AD) is van belang voor symptoombehandeling en onderzoek. Eén manier waarop deze diagnose kan worden gesteld is met behulp van Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Momenteel wordt AD bij mannen en vrouwen volgens dezelfde structurele MRI-maten vastgesteld. Er bestaan echter structurele verschillen tussen de hersenen van gezonde mannen en vrouwen. Daarnaast lijken mannen en vrouwen met AD te verschillen in hersenstructuur en cognitief functioneren. Dit zou kunnen wijzen op voordeel bij het gebruik van verschillende MRI-maten bij het classificeren van mannelijke en vrouwelijke Alzheimerpatiënten. Deze scriptie onderzoekt daarom middels een logistische regressieanalyse met een LASSO penalty of er geslachtsverschillen bestaan in de classificatie-accuratesse van structurele MRI-maten bij AD. Verwachtingen waren dat grijze stofdichtheid en corticale dikte een hogere classificatie-accuratesse zouden hebben voor vrouwen dan voor mannen, omdat vrouwen gemiddeld over een hogere grijze stofdichtheid en corticale dikte beschikken en sneller hersenatrofie laten zien bij AD. De classificatie- accuratesse van subcorticale volumes en ventrikelvolume werd ook onderzocht. Eventuele geslachtsverschillen in classificatie-accuratesse werden voor de vier hierboven genoemde MRI-maten onderzocht.

Depression and Anxious Attachment Style as predictors of Social Feedback processing from a developmental stage perspective,"Micha, Yuval",['Melisa Saygin'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social learning refers to how individuals discover what others think of them. This becomes possible due to receiving social feedback, given explicitly or implicitly. The present study focuses on two independent variables: depression, characterized by increased levels of negative emotion, and decreased levels of positive emotion. The second variable, anxious attachment style, is characterized by poor self-worth, a fear of abandonment, and a constant need for acceptance. The present study is also based on the ""self-speech"" task in which both adolescent (N=74) and adult (N=148) participants were asked to prepare a speech, after which they received performance feedback from judges. The first two hypotheses tested whether depression and anxious attachment style are significantly associated with a higher rate of negative learning and a lower rate of positive learning in adolescent participants. The latter two hypotheses tested whether developmental stage (adolescents versus adults) interacts with depression level to significantly predict a higher rate of positive learning and a lower rate of negative learning among adult participants, even after controlling the levels of anxious attachment style. Furthermore, this study includes two models: Model 1 includes one general social learning rate, while Model 2 has two different social learning rates (positive and negative). By comparing the BIC values between these models, it was determined that there is a significant difference between using one or two learning rates, which means that Model 2 has a better fit in the data compared to Model 1. This adds new knowledge to the field by showing that social feedback is not a single construct but can fluctuate in intensity as negative or positive.","['Attachment style, Depression, Adolescence, Social learning']"
Flexibility on the Spectrum: Impairment of Cognitive Flexibility in Subclinical Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Rock, Liv-Emily","['Jongkees, B.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often experience impairments in executive functions. Cognitive flexibility, or the capacity to adjust effectively to situational demands, is necessary for adaptive behavior, as is cognitive stability, which is the capacity to focus on a present activity despite interruption. Although there has been research on cognitive inflexibility and ASD, less is known about the relationship between cognitive flexibility and other, less well-researched features of subclinical ASD. The current study aimed to investigate whether attention to numbers and pattern, as specific features of subclinical ASD, predict cognitive flexibility impairment. In order to assess this relationship, the study recruited 100 participants and performed a task-switching exercise along with a self-report assessment of ASD symptoms. High scores for number/pattern recognition were thought to increase switch cost, the degradation in performance when transitioning between tasks, in people with subclinical ASD. Furthermore, it was assumed that the same individuals would have greater stability as evidenced by a lower incongruence cost, indicating less cross-task interference. While there was no significant correlation between cognitive flexibility and subclinical ASD features, we found some contradicting results that suggested a positive relationship for incongruence cost. The study was able to point out the need for more investigation, while raising questions about how attention to numbers and patterns and cognitive flexibility relate to one another in individuals with ASD. Future studies may focus on examining the neural bases of cognitive flexibility in order to provide a more thorough explanation.","['Cognitive flexibility', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)', 'switch cost', 'incongruence cost.']"

Cool Little Kids is een programma dat zich richt op de preventie van angstproblemen bij verlegen en teruggetrokken kinderen van 3 tot 6 jaar. De Cool Little Kids interventie focust onder andere op het verminderen van overbeschermend opvoedgedrag van de ouders. Het effect van de Cool Little Kids interventie is vergeleken met de controle conditie, waarbij ouders een boek ontvingen met opvoedingstips. In het onderzoek hebben ouders voor en na de interventie een vragenlijst ingevuld over ouderlijk overbeschermend opvoedgedrag (N = 113). Aan de hand van de scores op deze vragenlijsten is het effect van de experimentele en controle conditie op overbeschermend opvoedgedrag bepaald, en de verschillen tussen beide condities op de voormeting en nameting zijn met elkaar vergeleken. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat er een significante vermindering was in overbeschermend opvoedgedrag na de Cool Little Kids interventie, maar ook na de controle interventie. Ook heeft het huidige onderzoek aangetoond dat er een significant interactie-effect bestaat in de scores op overbeschermend opvoedgedrag van beide condities tussen de voormeting en nameting, wat impliceert dat er een verschil zit in de effectiviteit van beide condities. De afname van overbeschermend opvoedgedrag was significant groter voor de Cool Little Kids interventie in vergelijking met de controle conditie.

Risk Confrontation in Primary Care as a Possible Teachable Moment Toward Healthy Lifestyle Changes in Individuals with High Cardiovascular Risk,"Gefeke, Leah-Marie","['Brust, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are one of the most common causes of death. Healthy lifestyle changes are the focus of primary prevention of CVD. Naturally occurring health events that spontaneously urge behavior changes have been defined as Teachable Moments (TM). However, so far TMs have been explored in urgent life events, such as experiencing an acute coronary event. The present study aimed to explore whether a less urgent event, such as being confronted with an increased risk of CVD would be a TM, which psychosocial factors are predicting this, and whether experiencing a TM in turn leads to improved health outcomes. Method. The study included 114 patients from GP practices, who were informed about their increased risk for developing CVD. They were provided with “The Stevit Box”, an at-home self-monitoring device measuring blood pressure (BP) and weight. Participants further filled out the Cardiac Lifestyle Change Intention (LCI) scale. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to investigate whether risk perception, affective impact, and a changed self-concept predicted LCI and reductions in BP and body mass index (BMI) at six months, controlling for BP and BMI at baseline. Further, univariate regressions were conducted with LCI as the predictor and BP and BMI as outcome variables, while controlling for baseline measurements. Results. Of our participants, 55.3% experienced increased lifestyle change intentions. A lower risk perception ((B= -0.27; CI = -0.39 - (-0.15)) and a higher change in self-concept (B = 0.34; CI= 0.23 - 0.44) were predictors of LCI. High risk perception (B= 0.23; CI= 0.06 - 0.42) and higher changes in self-concept (B= 0.54; CI= 0.37- 0.72) predicted a lower BMI reduction at six months. A higher change in self-concept predicted a higher reduction in BP (B=-3.32; CI= -6.55- (-0.09)). Lastly, LCI predicted higher reductions in BP (-5.04; CI= -9.08- (-0.29)). Conclusion. Results suggest that less urgent cardiac events, such as a confrontation with an increased risk for CVD, can be experienced as a potential TM that urges lifestyle change intentions and affects health outcomes. TMs may offer a unique opportunity to urge lifestyle changes in primary care.","['Cardiovascular Disease', 'Teachable Moment', 'Lifestyle Changes', 'Primary Care']"

Information sampling behavior when confronted with neutral, politically unloaded information was tested in an adapted Information Sampling Task. Additionally, the study entailed a survey to examine the variables conspiracy mentality (CM), specific conspiracy beliefs (SCB) and political orientation (PO). Most importantly, it was found that PO is a significant predictor of engaging in CM and SCB. Additionally, politically right oriented people compared to politically left oriented people were more likely to engage in CM and SCB. Nevertheless, no significance was discovered when examining whether an information sampling pattern could be found in conspiracy believers or political extremists when confronted with neutral, politically unloaded information. Overall, this research supports the already existing findings about the relationship between conspiracy theories and political ideology, and urges future research to investigate potential underlying patterns that could lead to believing in conspiracy beliefs and having extreme political ideologies.","['information sampling behavior', 'conspiracy mentality', 'specific conspiracy beliefs', 'political ideology']"
Exploring the Relationship Between the Perception of Light and Sound Environment and Affective Experience in Students: The moderating role of Communication Difficulties,"Viana, Gabriella","['Tsou, Y.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The physical environment in educational settings impacts students’ emotions, engagement, and academic performance differently. By understanding these differences, inclusive learning environments can be created to optimize students’ well-being and learning. Therefore, this thesis investigated the relationship between the perception of the light and sound environment and the affective experience (AE) of students with and without communication difficulties (CD), with the focus on exploring whether CD moderates this relationship. Using self-reports and real time surveys, the study assesses AE and environmental perception. Participants consisted of 23 individuals with CD and 18 without (mean age= 19.29 years), recruited from university and high school settings. The findings revealed distinct preferences between CD and non-CD students. CD students demonstrated an association between positive affect and better sound environment, whereas non-CD students exhibited a preference for better light environment. Furthermore, CD students reported a higher prevalence of negative emotions compared to their non-CD counterparts. Notably, a discrepancy emerged between the overall experience and real time measures, highlighting the need to refine methodologies for accurately capturing individuals’ perceptions of the environment. In conclusion, the study’s findings highlight the importance of considering individual differences among students and shaping their AE. The higher prevalence of negative emotions among CD students emphasizes the need for further research to better understand the underlying mechanisms contributing to this vulnerability. Moving forward, it is crucial to validate and expand upon these findings to promote the development of inclusive educational practices that prioritize the well-being and success of all students.","['Affective experiences', 'Communication difficulties', 'Environmental perception', 'Individual differences', 'Inclusive learning environments']"

Tackling the consumers: The effect of need for closure on the relationship between informative campaigns and food waste intentions,"Vande Ryse, Jorre","['Brizi, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Previous research finds that having a higher need for cognitive closure (NFC) leads to more stockpiling behaviors during uncertain periods such as COVID-19, consequently also creating more food waste. This result aligns with the characteristics of individuals with a higher NFC who look for certainty and dislike ambiguity, preferring stable and clear information. This research builds on these findings, assessing how the NFC can moderate the relationship between informative campaigns, that provide clear information about food waste prevention and success, and food waste intentions. A survey was administered to 152 respondents and featured campaigns with low and high informational value that served as an intervention. Before and after the intervention, respondents’ food waste intentions were measured. It was hypothesized that food waste intention will decrease at Time 2 compared to Time 1 and that food waste campaigns regarded as more informative will significantly lower food waste intentions in people with high NFC. While the intervention itself was found to be significant (F (1, 150) = 16.19, p <.001), this could not be attributed to the effects of the campaign intervention. Furthermore, a negative significant effect was found for the NFC on food waste intentions, suggesting that the interventions had the opposite effect than hypothesized. Nonetheless, the present research provides insight into important factors for designing food waste campaigns or interventions with the goal of providing information to the public.","['Food waste', 'need for closure', 'informational value', 'campaigns']"
Psychological Correlates of Belief in Conspiracy Theories during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Study of Robustness and Replicability of the Interaction Effect Between Dark Triad Personality Traits and Social Status,"Brinzova, Bianka",['Dr. Ethan M.

Understanding the psychological and social factors that contribute to belief in conspiracy theories is crucial for managing the preventative measures and promoting evidence-based decision-making. However, the field of psychology has recently faced challenges regarding the replicability and robustness of research findings. This bachelor thesis aims to investigate the robustness and replicability of interaction effects in a study on beliefs in conspiracy theories and attitudes towards anti-coronavirus measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The thesis extracts data from a study by Hudecek et al. (2022) on the psychological correlates of beliefs in conspiracy theories in Germany. Specifically, it examines the interaction effect between dark triad personality traits and social status in predicting belief in conspiracy theories. The thesis utilizes resampling to test the robustness of the interaction effects. The analysis includes three subsamples (random, central, extreme) with three dropout conditions (10%, 20%, 30%). F tests are conducted to assess the variance between two given methods. The results revealed that the distribution of the interaction coefficients remain fairly stable in the central resampling approach pointing to robustness, however, significant inconsistencies were observed in the random and extreme resampling approach. Future research calls for replicating the study in diverse populations, investigating additional predictors of belief in conspiracy theories and testing the robustness and replicability of previous findings to address the replication crisis in the social sciences.","['COVID-19', 'dark triad', 'social status', 'robustness', 'replicability']"
Cowage-evoked nocebo itch trial: No mediating effect of itch catastrophizing on gender and itch avoidance behavior,"Walton, Kinga","['Wolters, F.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Most knowledge about itch is derived from pain studies which leads to a lack of research on itch, especially on gender differences in itch. This study therefore investigated the mediation effect of itch catastrophizing on gender and itch avoidance behaviour, in the context of a nocebo study. The participants’ itch catastrophizing levels were measured using self-reports and cowage spicules were used to induce itch in 11 healthy participants. Classical conditioning and verbal suggestion were used to induce nocebo effects. The expectancy acquisition phase comprised of conditioning the participants to believe that Cyclosol cream (the nocebo cream) evokes itch. The nocebo conditioning phase was followed by an avoidance acquisition phase where gripping strength was linked to a decrease in itch sensation, which served as a measure for avoidance behavior in the avoidance test phase. No nocebo effect or mediation effects were detected. Future research should expand on the influence of gender in the context of itch by expanding the sample size and by striving for a balanced gender distribution, especially by focusing on a clinical sample outside of a laboratory setting",

"The Psychonaut’s Journey to Overcoming Death: A Survey Study on Psychedelic-induced Mystical Experiences, Death Transcendence, Death Anxiety, and Meaning in Life","Schmidt, Josefina","['Beykoylu, H.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Psychedelics have long been known to deeply affect a person’s psyche. The current study investigated whether the intensity of psychedelic-induced mystical experiences is positively associated with death transcendence and negatively with fear of death, and whether greater death transcendence is related to a decreased fear of death. Moreover, this study aimed to ascertain whether death transcendence is positively associated with meaning in life, mediated by fear of death. It also investigated self-reported reasons for potential changes in psychedelic users’ fear of death. To test these hypotheses, an online survey including the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), the Death Transcendence Scale (DTS), the Revised Collett-Lester Fear of Death Scale (CL-FODS), and the Three-Dimensional Meaning in Life Scale (3DM) was conducted. Overall, 111 individuals (including 74 psychedelic users) completed the survey. To analyze the data, Pearson correlations were calculated, Linear Regression analyses, a thematic analysis, and an Independent-Samples t-test were conducted. The results show that a more intense psychedelic-induced mystical experience is positively associated with death transcendence and negatively with fear of death. However, no significant relationships could be found between the other variables. Finally, the thematic analysis suggests that there are qualitative connections between all of the concepts relevant to the present study. Due to some limitations of the current study, future studies are needed to re-investigate these hypotheses with better-fitting scales and a better study method. This paper makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of psychedelics’ potential role in increasing meaning in life and in decreasing death anxiety.",

To Go or to No-Go: Targeting Threat Disengagement in an Alternative Attention Bias Modification (ABM) Training Paradigm,"Libovická, Veronika","['Severo, M.C.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"One of the most prominent recent approaches to the treatment of anxiety symptoms is the Attention Bias Modification (ABM) training, a computerized treatment method which targets the dysfunctional attentional biases (AB) prevalent in anxiety disorders. The aim of this study was to pilot an alternative ABM training paradigm targeting delayed threat disengagement based on an adaptation of the Additional Singleton Paradigm (ASP). Thirty-four participants underwent three phases (i.e., pre-training, training, post-training) of a visual search task while being presented with emotional faces (angry vs. happy), while their reaction times (RT) and accuracy rates were measured. We expected that during pre-training, participants would respond slower in trials with threatening stimuli (angry faces) as compared to non-threatening stimuli (happy faces) and that this difference would diminish after the training phase. Additionally, participants were surveyed on the Attention Bias Questionnaire (ABQ) which assessed the participants’ subjective experience of threat and ability to disengage from threat. We expected that the participants’ degree of AB would positively correlate with their RT’s in the task. The results of the analysis showed only a general practice effect of the training and not a statistically significant effect of the proposed ABM training on the participants RT’s. Moreover, no significant correlation between the ABQ scores and RT’s was found. The lack of statistically significant differences between the groups may be due to a small sample size, limited demographic, task delivery context, and testing of non-anxious individuals. Overall, the effectiveness of the proposed ABM training task remains to be established.",

Academische eisen en emotionele uitputting onder studenten: Welke rol spelen academische hulpbronnen?,"Ruiter, Lisa","['Duijnhoven, A. Van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De werkdruk voor studenten is de laatste jaren toegenomen. Burn-out door studiestress is daarmee ook een groeiend probleem onder studenten. Om de belangrijkste component van burn-out, emotionele uitputting, tegen te gaan, is het van belang om te kijken of academische eisen en academische hulpbronnen een rol spelen in het verklaren van deze emotionele uitputting. In het huidig onderzoek wordt daarom, op basis van het ‘Study Demands- Resources’ model, gekeken naar mogelijke relaties tussen academische eisen (werktempo/werkhoeveelheid en rolconflict), academische hulpbronnen (autonomie, feedback, sociale steun van begeleiders en sociale steun van medestudenten) en emotionele uitputting binnen Nederlandstalige universiteitsstudenten. Daarnaast wordt er gekeken of academische hulpbronnen mogelijk een bufferende werking kunnen hebben op de relatie tussen academische eisen en emotionele uitputting. Voor het huidig cross-sectioneel onderzoek is er een online vragenlijst onder Nederlandstalige universiteitsstudenten verspreid. In totaal hebben 173 studenten deelgenomen. Uit de resultaten is, zoals verwacht, gebleken dat er een positieve relatie bestaat tussen de onderzochte academische eisen (werktempo/werkhoeveelheid en rolconflict) en emotionele uitputting. Daarnaast is er, zoals ook verwacht, een negatieve relatie gevonden tussen academische hulpbronnen (autonomie, feedback en sociale steun van begeleiders) en de onderzochte academische eisen (werktempo/werkhoeveelheid en rolconflict). De bufferende werking van academische hulpbronnen op de relatie tussen academische eisen en emotionele uitputting was echter niet significant. Er moet dus nog meer onderzoek worden gedaan naar deze bufferende werking, omdat academische hulpbronnen zo ingezet kunnen worden binnen universiteiten, om de mentale gezondheid van studenten in Nederland in de toekomst te bevorderen.",
Disengage to Reengage: An Adaptation of the Additional Singleton Paradigm as a New Approach to Attention Bias Modification Training,"Mahlmann, Johanna","['Severo, M.C.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Anxiety, a global health-related burden, is associated with preferential processing of threat, which is referred to as attention bias. Such bias is thought to be due to heightened attentional engagement to threat and/or difficulties in disengagement from threat, it can be altered through Attention Bias Modification (ABM) Training. Unfortunately, the predominantly used task in ABM training shows low effectiveness. Thus, this study aims to develop a new task that trains threat disengagement using a visual search task with emotionally valent faces. Thirty-four participants took part in an online experiment and completed a Go/ No-go-like Visual Search task designed to train disengagement from negative stimuli. Reaction time and accuracy were measured to examine the effect of the task while trait anxiety scores were gathered to examine the relationship between anxiety and attention bias. The results revealed no significant differences in threat disengagement as a function of training and no correlation between trait anxiety scores and threat disengagement. These findings may be attributable to the small sample size used or to the participants showing a lack of attention bias even before training commenced. Despite the study’s null findings, suggestions on how to improve the paradigm are presented and discussed to guide future studies to come up with an effective ABM training task.","['Attention', 'Attention Bias', 'Anxiety', 'Attention Bias Modification']"

De deelnemers waren mannen tussen de 18 en 25 jaar oud die atypisch waren voor de non profit organisatie in het onderzoek (N = 68). Een multipele regressieanalyse liet zien dat sympathie en de aantrekkelijkheid van de organisatie significant positief zijn gerelateerd aan donatiebereidheid.

The study employed established questions and tasks used in peer-reviewed papers. The study differed between the concepts risk tolerance and risk preference. Multiple linear regression was used to analyse the data, which was performed in SPSS. After analysing the data it was concluded that scarcity and risk-taking have a positive relationship when tested with the risk-tolerance variable. For the risk preference variable this effect was only present if gender was controlled. Neuroticism also moderates the effect of financial scarcity on risk-taking for the risk-tolerance variable, but not the risk-preference variable. It was found that neuroticism weakens the relationship between scarcity and risk- taking. The study contributes to literature about the effect of neuroticism on the tendency to take or avoid risks, as well as the literature on how scarcity can increase the tendency to take risks in practical setting such as treating those with gambling addictions or tendency to overspend. The paper was limited by its risk preference measure, which did not properly simulate a risk-reward scenario, contrary to the risk tolerance measure.","['scarcity', 'neuroticism', 'poverty', 'risk-taking', 'positive urgency', 'negative urgency', 'survey', 'questionnaire', 'risk tolerance', 'risk preference']"

However, the influence of psychological factors, specifically self-esteem, on sexual function in this population remains insufficiently explored. In this cross-sectional study, data were collected via an online survey administered through Qualtrics. The survey incorporated ad-hoc items of the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) to assess dyspareunia, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI-6) to evaluate sexual function, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale to measure self-esteem. The study included 168 women formally diagnosed with endometriosis. The data of the current project indicated that age and dyspareunia were significant predictors of female sexual function among individuals with endometriosis. However, self-esteem did not emerge as a significant predictor. Contrary to previous literature, higher self-esteem scores were associated with greater dyspareunia and subsequently lower sexual function. Nonetheless, the substantial imbalance in sample sizes between individuals with higher and lower self-esteem may reduce statistical power of these findings. Importantly, the overall self-esteem scores in this sample were notably lower compared to the general population, underscoring the significant psychological impact of endometriosis. Further research is necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted nature of sexual function in women affected by endometriosis. Moreover, efforts should be directed towards developing clinical interventions that focus on promoting pain management, considering the complex interplay between psychological and physical factors in this population.","['Endometriosis, sexual function, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, self-esteem, age.']"

In dit onderzoek werd gekeken of een recente cafeïne-inname ook zorgt voor een betere prestatie op een virtual reality (VR) game waarbij asynchronie optrad. Hierbij werd er gecontroleerd voor normale dagelijkse inname, omdat hierdoor een tolerantie kan worden opgebouwd die het effect van een recente inname kan verminderen. Ook werd gecontroleerd voor gevoelens van verwarring. De onderzoeksvraag die daaruit voortkomt luidt: Wat is de invloed van een recente cafeïne-intake op het vermogen van de participanten om zo snel mogelijk voor een verwarrende mismatch corrigeren? Methode: Vooraf werd er een korte vragenlijst ingevuld. Daarna speelden de 70 participanten de VR game, waarin ze items moesten vangen die op hen afkwamen. Op willekeurige momenten trad er temporele, spatiële of dubbele asynchronie tussen de arm van de participant en de avatar op, waarvoor gecorrigeerd moest worden. Na de game vulden de participanten vragenlijsten in over onder andere hun cafeïnegebruik. Resultaten: Er waren geen verschillen in scores tussen participanten die wel of niet recent cafeïne hadden genomen. Normale dagelijkse inname en gevoelens van verwarring hadden noch invloed op de score op de game, noch op het verband tussen recente inname en score op de game. Discussie: Op basis van deze studie kan niet gezegd worden dat cafeïne ervoor zorgt dat men beter kan corrigeren voor asynchronie. Verder onderzoek zou nog meer kunnen ingaan op de relatie tussen verwarring en cafeïne of experimenteren met een meer natuurgetrouwe artificiële omgeving.","['cafeïne, virtual reality, avatar, asynchronie, mismatch, corrigeren']"
Neuroanatomical Abnormalities in Clinical and Subclinical Social Anxiety,"Benson, Rebecca","['Bas-Hoogendam, J. M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is characterised by fear of negative evaluation from others, causing avoidance behaviour and various functional impairments. Subclinical social anxiety (SSA) involves fear of negative evaluation without the avoidance behaviour or accompanying functional impairments. Findings of grey matter characteristic (GMC) abnormalities in SAD have been inconsistent, with both increased and decreased grey matter volume and cortical thickness found in various areas, as well as no differences between individuals with SAD and those with no social anxiety diagnosis (ND). Emerging studies in SSA have found increased grey matter volume in multiple brain areas. Correlations between social anxiety symptom severity and GMCs have suggested a linear relationship between symptom severity and the extent of abnormalities. This study assessed whether GMCs differ between participants with ND and SAD or SSA, and whether GMCs correlate with symptom severity. Participants (N = 61, aged between 9.15 and 59.58 years) were divided into three groups – SAD, SSA, and ND – based on diagnostic interviews using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Plus or -Kid. Symptom severity was determined using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale or Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents. GMC data was collected using magnetic resonance imaging. Seven regions of interest (ROIs) were analysed: the amygdala, hippocampus, putamen, temporal pole, inferior temporal gyrus, and insula. Exploratory analyses were conducted on a further 35 brain areas. No differences between SAD or SSA and ND groups, nor any correlations between symptom severity and GMCs, were found in any ROI. Exploratory analyses revealed a smaller left pars opercularis in individuals with SAD than with SSA or ND, and a correlation between symptom severity and cortical surface area in the right bank superior temporal sulcus. The present study did not provide evidence for differences in GMC between participants with SAD or SSA and ND in any ROI. This is consistent with previous work reporting null-findings. There were, however, differences in the left pars opercularis and correlations in the right bank superior temporal sulcus. Larger studies using voxel-based morphometry, or studies assessing how comorbidities impact differences between individuals with SAD or SSA and ND would expand upon the results of this study.",
"Validating Endometriosis: Making the Pain Visible: The Effects of Diagnostics, Chronic Pain, Well-being, and Self-esteem in Individuals with Endometriosis.","Schüttler, Alice",['Dr. I.A. Ghita'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background. Endometriosis is a gynecological disorder and develops as a result of endometrial tissue growing external to the uterus. This condition is associated with severe chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia, affecting up to 10% of individuals born with a female reproductive system. Due to insufficient understanding about its underlying causes, receiving a diagnosis is challenging which adds to a diagnostic delay of 8 to 14 years on average. This may cause negative effects on the individual’s mental health and overall functioning. Aim. The primary objective of this study was to explore how diagnostic related factors, such as diagnostic methods and delay, influence the pain perception in individuals suffering from endometriosis. Further, the underling factors such as self-esteem and psychological well-being were investigated to gain a broader understanding of this multidimensional condition. Methods. The study consisted of the questionnaires: Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE), Psychological Well-Being (PWB), Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and additional ad-hoc items measuring diagnostic delay (DD), and diagnostic methods. Statistical analysis was conducted through independent sample-t tests to investigate mean differences between DD and diagnostic methods on perceived pain. A mediation analysis was conducted to investigate the mediating effect of NPRS on the relationship between RSE and PWB. Results. No significant differences were found between diagnostic methods and perceived pain. However, the results indicated that perceived pain differs depending on DD. Additionally, the mediation of NPRS on the relationship between RSE and PWB was found to be significant. Conclusion. Findings show no validifying effect of diagnostic methods (invasive, noninvasive) and no effects of receiving laparoscopic surgery, in regards of perceived pain. Additionally, perceived pain increases with DD, leading to dysregulation of somatic and visceral pain symptoms. Finally, the interplay of psychological components such as self-esteem and physical symptoms play a significant role in terms of well-being.","['endometriosis', 'chronic pain', 'well-being', 'self-esteem', 'diagnosis', 'diagnostic delay']"
The Influence of Parental Verbal Expressions of Threat versus Safety about Strangers on Children’s Attention: The role of Child Behavioral Inhibition,"Dam, Mara van","['Aktar, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"While fear of social situations is common, excessive social fears, as observed in social anxiety disorder (SAD), can have debilitating consequences on one’s life. Social fears increase from early to mid-adolescence, heightening vulnerability to developing SAD. Parents’ threatening verbal comments in a social context could influence children’s fear response, including attention, and lead to social fear acquisition. Additionally, children with higher behavioral inhibition (BI), who are more cautious and withdrawn in novel situations, can be more open to the effects of parental remarks than children with lower BI. Therefore, the current thesis aimed to investigate the effect of parental verbal threat versus safety about strangers on children’s attention to strangers, while looking at BI as a moderator. The children (age M = 11.62, SD = 1.18, range: 9.5-14) gave a presentation for two strangers after receiving either threatening or safe verbal descriptions of these strangers from their parents. Results showed that the child’s attention (i.e., looking duration) toward the stranger did not significantly differ between the threat and safe conditions. Furthermore, there was no significant moderation by BI. Thus, child attention was not influenced by parental verbal information irrespective of individual differences in child BI. Future studies could investigate children’s development of SAD further by focusing on the role of parental SAD, as well as the effects of repetitive exposure to parental verbal threat, other variables related to attention, and the developmental trajectories regarding BI.","['Parents', 'Verbal Learning', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Inhibition', 'Verbal Threat', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Social Performance', 'Looking Duration', 'Strangers', 'Children']"

Binnen dit onderzoek zijn droomverslagen gescoord op de variabelen positief en negatief affect en vergeleken tussen neuro-typische controles en patiënten die lijden aan de ziekte van Urbach-Wiethe, waarbij bilaterale calcificatie van de BLA optreedt. Deze robuustheid is onderzocht middels een Multiverse Analyse, waarbij er wordt gekeken naar de invloed van alternatieve keuzes op gevonden resultaten. De resultaten van deze analyse suggereren dat het effect van verhoogd positief affect robuust lijkt te zijn voor het excluderen van patiënten met schade buiten de BLA en het toepassen van correcties voor afhankelijkheid tussen droomverslagen van dezelfde participant. Het effect lijkt in mindere mate robuust voor het toevoegen van het aantal woorden per droom als covariaat en lijkt het minst robuust te zijn voor het gebruiken van dichotome classificaties om de scores van positief en negatief affect te bepalen in plaats van de originele 3-punts Likertschaal. Ook het gevonden nul effect dat schade aan de basolaterale amygdala niet leidt tot verminderd negatief affect van dromen lijkt voor elk van de verschillende keuzes robuust te zijn. Hoewel de meeste alternatieve paden in de Multiverse gelijkwaardige resultaten opleverden, zorgde het gebrek aan ruwe data ervoor dat niet alle mogelijkheden onderzocht konden worden.

The Dark Triad: Fueling In-group Bias? The Dark Triad and In-group Bias: Does Scoring Highly on the Dark Triad Evoke Higher In-group Bias?,"Szpil, Piotr","['Fariña, A']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The leader-member exchange (LMX) theory emphasises the relationship between leaders and subordinates at the workplace, suggesting that leaders quickly create in and out-groups with certain subordinates which can lead to in-group bias, the act of favouritism of members of your in-group compared to members of an out group. An in-group is a social group which an individual identifies with, whilst an out-group is consequently the dissimilarity to an in-group. It has also been found that people who score highly on the Dark Triad are likely to hold leadership positions. The Dark Triad is a psychological theory of personality illustrating three dark personality types consisting of malicious qualities: Machiavellianism, sub-clinical narcissism and sub-clinical psychopathy. With leaders scoring highly on the Dark Triad and the plausibility of in-group bias occurring in organisations, it is important to investigate whether the Dark Triad influences in-group bias to remove in-group bias from a leader and organisation and cease LMX from forming. Therefore, this paper examines whether in-group bias is present using the dictator game and whether the Dark Triad (both traits individually and as a whole) accentuates in-group bias. First-year psychology students from Leiden University (n = 75) participated in a dictator game to measure in-group bias, before completing the SD3 questionnaire to measure levels of the Dark Triad. Three hypotheses were made: firstly, dictators will allocate a higher endowment to in-group recipients compared to out-group recipients. Secondly, participants scoring highly on either Machiavellianism, narcissism, or both will have a higher in-group bias. Thirdly, participants scoring highly on the Dark Triad as a whole will demonstrate higher in-group bias. Results indicate in-group bias, however, no significant results were found in the relationship between the Dark Triad and in-group bias. This is the first paper to directly investigate the relationship between the Dark Triad and in-group bias with many limitations obstructing the accuracy and generalisability of the results. Therefore, this study lays the groundwork for future research in investigating this relationship.","['The Dark Triad', 'In-group bias', 'Machiavellianism', 'Dictator game', 'Narcissism', 'Psychopathy', 'LMX', 'Decision Making', 'Leadership']"

Given the ever-increasing cultural diversity within the Netherlands, research should consider the unique challenges of building an intercultural therapeutic relationship. Researching specific questions in this area will inform psychotherapy on accommodating the growing culturally diverse population. Hence, this research aimed to investigate the influence of Hofstede’s (1980) individualism cultural dimension on the intercultural therapeutic relationship. This influence was quantified by observing scores (N=122) on the Manual of California Psychotherapy Alliance Scales (CALPAS) relational outcome variables: Working Strategy Consensus (WSC) and Patient Commitment (PC). The patient version (CALPAS-P) was integrated with a questionnaire on background information. Client and therapist's country of origin was used for categorising responses into groups: those where the client and therapist shared an individualistic or collectivist culture of origin (an intracultural therapeutic relationship) (N=103); or those who differed with their therapist on this dimension (an intercultural relationship) (N=19). Two one-way ANOVAs tested the hypotheses. Hypothesis one tested if mean scores for WSC would be lower for clients in an intercultural therapeutic relationship compared to clients in an intracultural therapeutic relationship. Hypothesis two tested if mean scores for PC would be lower for clients in an intercultural therapeutic relationship compared to clients in an intracultural therapeutic relationship. Both analyses were insignificant, suggesting that building WSC and PC in an intercultural relationship is not significantly different to intracultural therapy. Alternative interpretations and limitations in methodology are discussed, facilitating suggestions for future research.","['therapeutic relationship, intercultural therapeutic relationship, intracultural therapeutic relationship, individualism cultural dimension, individualism, collectivism, Working Strategy Consensus, Patient Commitment, cultural competency']"

Om het verband tussen deze begrippen te onderzoeken is gebruik gemaakt van een samengestelde vragenlijst, waarbij gebruik werd gemaakt van de ‘Traditional Masculinity-Femininity Scale’ (TMF Scale), de ‘Prosociality Scale’, de ‘Dispostional Positive Emotion Scale (DPES) Awe Subscale’ en de ‘Short Dark Triad’ (SD3). Uit de resultaten is naar voren gekomen dat het verschil in gemiddelde score op prosociaal gedrag voor mannen en vrouwen niet significant is en dus als gelijk kan worden beschouwd. Verder werd er een negatieve zwakke correlatie gevonden tussen de TMF score en de ‘dark triad’ score. Er werden geen sterke verbanden gevonden tussen de ‘dark triad’, prosociaal gedrag en ‘awe’.

"De genderdiverse Pyrronist: Het verband tussen Pyrronisme, angst en stress met genderidentiteit als moderator","Hertog, Marre Jace Heluan","['van den Berg, T.A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"This study investigated whether there is a relationship between Pyrrhonism and anxiety and stress with gender identity as a moderator. According to ancient Greek philosophy, a Pyrrhonist attitude ensures the presence of Ataraxia (or peace of mind). This study examined whether Pyrrhonism is associated with stress and anxiety. The Non Evident Questionnaire was developed to measure the independent variable. This was administered in a test battery together with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The test battery was completed online by 176 people. The first hypothesis stated that a Pyrrhonistic attitude and anxiety and stress would be negatively correlated. The second hypothesis was that identifying as transgender would weaken the effect. The main analysis was found to be insignificant for both GAD-7 and PSS. In the moderation analysis, the second hypothesis was found to be significant for both GAD-7 and PSS. On closer examination of the data, the effect turned out to be significantly positive in cisgender people, while it was insignificant and negative in transgender people. The conclusion of this study is that gender identity changes the effect of Pyrrhonism on anxiety and that Pyrrhonism does not reduce anxiety.","['Pyrronisme', 'Transgender', 'genderidentiteit', 'angst', 'stress', 'filosofie']"

"No Association Between Gender, Anxiety, Depression and Itch Ratings in Healthy Volunteers","Álvarez Colic, Natalie","['Wolters, F.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Itch is one of the most common conditions worldwide and can lead to higher anxiety and depression symptoms. There is ambiguity on whether anxiety and depression also affect it. This study investigated whether gender affects itch ratings and if this is mediated by anxiety and/or depression. 11 healthy controls, 18 to 35 years old, participated in this study, whereby the DASS-21 and an additional four questionnaires were implemented to investigate the associations between the variables. A dynamometer measured itch avoidance and itch was evoked through cowhage spicules. Nocebo and verbal suggestions were also part of this study. Males scored higher on depression (M = 5, SD = 4.24), while females scored higher on anxiety (M = 6.67, SD = 5.74). The mediation analysis yielded no significant results, except for the indirect effect of depression and itch ratings at baseline, t(9) = 3.313, p = .011, and partial mediation: t(9) = 2.519, p = .036. The control condition of the expectation phase yielded a significant result regarding depression, t(9) = 3.453, p = .009. Overall, there were no significant relationships found between gender, anxiety, depression, and itch ratings, contradicting to previous literature. Due to the current small sample size, further research is needed to investigate the relationship between gender, psychological traits and itch ratings to improve treatment in clinical settings. This could be achieved through larger and more demographically varied samples.",
Switching It Up: Exploring the Relationship Between the Attention-Switching Autism Trait and Cognitive Flexibility and Stability,"Sandow, Greta","['Jongkees, B.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Every day we come across situations that require our attention, and our ability to stay focused on a task or get distracted depends on our levels of cognitive stability and flexibility. A disorder which has been associated with particularly stable attention is autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Traits of ASD are distributed along a continuum and can be found at subthreshold levels in the general population. One of these traits of autism specifically represent the inability to efficiently handle everyday situations that require switching attention between different tasks. It is of interest to assess whether these attentional difficulties in daily life related to non-clinical levels of ASD might be connected to different functioning of cognitive flexibility and stability. A link between these concepts might help to further understand the mechanisms behind ASD and how to cope with the resulting deficits in attention. This study investigated whether the “switching” trait of the short-form AutismSpectrum Quotient questionnaire could predict cognitive flexibility and stability as measured by performance on a task switching paradigm in the general population. While the expected switch cost and incongruence cost were found for both reaction times and error rates, they were not significantly predicted by the scores on the “switching” autism trait subscale. This suggests that attentional difficulties of ASD at the subthreshold level do not predict the functioning of cognitive flexibility or stability. Future research should further investigate the connection between ASD, the different subthreshold traits of it, and cognitive flexibility and stability, possibly with varied measurement instruments.",

The relationship between pretreatment catastrophizing and the effect of a multidisciplinary treatment of chronic low back pain,"Bouter, Evie",['Twan van Opstal'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The overarching aim of this study was to examine the relationship between pretreatment catastrophizing and its subdimensions in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) on the effect of a multidisciplinary treatment with a specific physical approach. Based on the literature research it was hypothesized that more pretreatment catastrophizing leads to poorer treatment outcomes. This is a retrospective quasi-experimental study of 80 rehabilitation patients with CLBP by administration of self-report questionnaires and several physical measures. Measurements were taken at start and end of the treatment. The outcome measures were pain, disability, quality of life and lumbopelvic stability. Patients followed an eight-week rehabilitation treatment at the Spine and Joint Centre in Rotterdam. The goal of the treatment is to restore function and control movement of the spine and pelvis by focusing on quality of movement. Results show that treatment has significant effects on improved outcome measures. However, the amount of pretreatment catastrophizing and its subdimensions have no significant relationship with effects of treatment on changes in treatment outcomes, except for the subdimension helplessness and pain. Patients with higher pretreatment helplessness tend to benefit more from treatment on pain outcomes. It was concluded that no patients can be declined treatment based on pretreatment catastrophizing scores. Further research can investigate if pretreatment catastrophizing has a relationship with solely the outcome measures at the end of the treatment or if a decline in catastrophizing during treatment has a relationship with treatment outcomes.","['Chronic low back pain (CLBP) – catastrophizing (rumination, magnification, helplessness) – multidisciplinary treatment']"
The Interplay Between Structure Learning and Reinforcement Learning in Human Decision- Making,"Every, Zulema",['Franz Wurm'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful framework useful in explaining learning and reward maximization within both the computational and cognitive neuroscience fields. In highly dimensional naturalistic environments, reinforcement principles are naïve in explaining high-level decision-making assuming that the underlying environmental structure is prespecified to the learner. Theories suggest that reinforcement learning methods exploit a complementary neural process, termed structure learning, that can detect and make inferences on the causal structure within high-dimensional environments. This study aims to investigate the shared cognitive capacities between structure learning and reinforcement learning by employing three decision-making tasks, the two-stage Markov Decision task (MDT) and the Weather Prediction Task (WPT), which derive metrics on reinforcement learning, and the Credit Assignment Task (CAT), which derives metrics on structure learning. The central hypotheses expects that performance measures across all tasks are significantly correlated and was investigated by means of behavioral data from the three tasks performed by 48 individuals. Pearson correlations were performed between overall performance and reaction times on the three tasks revealing significant correlations between performance on the CAT and both the MDT and the WPT. Furthermore, confidence in correct cue-outcome assignment, which was a measure for explicit credit assignment was found to be significantly correlated with performance on the MDT. These findings support the central hypotheses that reinforcement learning and structure learning share similar cognitive mechanisms. Recommendations for future research include exploring the various forms of learning through a more comprehensive study on the various types of decision-making tasks and fitting well adapted computational models to the data for better comparison.",

Sanne Willems'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In order to achieve integrity and trustworthiness of research, uncertainty of information needs to be communicated with the public. However, it is not always clear what types of data representation induce the most trust and which individual variables influence this. Previous studies have shown that there are trust differences between numerical and verbal representations as well as different uncertainty levels. Other research suggests that education level may be related to trust while research on numeracy and graphical literacy (GL) implies a potential relationship. Numeracy and GL have been reported to have a moderate correlation. Furthermore, trust is theorized to subsist of the related but distinct concepts of trust in number (TN) and trust in source (TS). To investigate these topics, participants were invited to a questionnaire study presenting an uncertainty scenario and assessing their trust as well as individual variables of numeracy, GL and education. Factors of different uncertainty levels, formats and education levels were used to create nine conditions that assessed whether the factors influenced trust. Results showed a small positive correlation between GL and numeracy. A positive moderate relationship was found between TN and TS. Moreover, results displayed a significant difference in TN between verbal and graphical uncertainty communication. Lastly, education was highlighted as a possible predictor of TN. Findings highlight education as a variable related to TN and strengthen the position that trust should be subdivided into TN and TS. Because of theoretical inconsistencies in our findings, more research has to be done on the effect of uncertainty level, format and education level in uncertainty communication.","['uncertainty communication', 'trust', 'trust in number', 'trust in source', 'graphical literacy', 'numeracy', 'education', 'format']"

Improving the Grow It! M-Health Tool: Examining the Role of Real-Time Personalized Feedback,"Meyser, Louise","['Root, N.', 'Dietvorst, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Studying the effects of mobile health (m-health) apps is crucial for providing accessible mental healthcare to people at high risk for psychopathology, such as adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, investigating elements such as real-time personalized feedback are essential to understand what underpins the effectiveness of m-health. The Grow It! app is a multiplayer serious gaming m-health app for adolescents aged 12 to 25 aimed at identification of emotional problems and improving well-being. This study aimed to improve suboptimal app activity (i.e., amount of experience sampling method questionnaires completed) by incorporating feedback in the form of an emotion overview chart into the app. Furthermore, this study wanted to investigate changes in affective and cognitive wellbeing and assess how users rate the emotion overview. Method: Adolescents (N = 143) played Grow It! for three weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants filled in a questionnaire before and after playing the app, to measure differences in affective (measured on a 7-point Likert scale) and cognitive (measured on a 10-point Likert scale) well-being. The emotion overview was evaluated with four questions. Results: After conducting two paired samples t-tests, I found that affective well-being significantly increased by 0.29 points, t(142) = 3.30, p < .001 (one-tailed), d = .28. Forty percent (40%) of individuals experienced increases. Cognitive well-being significantly increased with 0.44 points, t(142) = 3.17, p < .001 (one-tailed), d = .27. Forty-nine percent (49%) of individuals experienced increases. After conducting a one-way ANOVA, I found that app activity was significantly higher for users playing Grow It! with the emotion overview included, F(2,1335) = 53.13, p < .001. User evaluations were overall positive with the emotion overview being a welcomed addition. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate successful replication of previous studies and support gamification theories on the usefulness of real-time personalized feedback. The addition of the emotion overview seems valuable for increasing app activity and positive app evaluations. Further research with a control group is recommended to be able to make any substantial claims on the effectiveness of Grow It! and what added value the emotion overview provides.","['Grow It!', 'Experience Sampling Method', 'Personalized Feedback', 'Emotion Overview', 'Compliance', 'Engagement', 'App Activity', 'M-health Application', 'Serious Gaming Application', 'Cognitive Well-being', 'Affective Well-being', 'User Evaluation']"

K.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Research shows that sexual minority individuals are often faced with stressors that are associated with their minority status and that these stressors affect their psychological well-being. This leaves the question which factors are implicated in their thriving and thus in their psychological well-being. This study used the relational cultural theory and investigated potential protective factors in the lives of sexual minorities. In particular, it investigated the associations between two dimensions of attachment style (model of self and model of others), self-respect, and psychological well-being and checked for a possible mediation effect of self-respect in the relationship between model of self and model of others and psychological well-being in a population of sexual minority adults (N= 241). The effects between the variables mentioned were tested using the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire – Short Form, the Relationship Questionnaire, and a Self-Respect measure through an online survey. Model of self was found to be positively associated with self-respect while model of others was not. Both dimensions of attachment style were found to correlate with psychological well-being. Self-respect was also found to be positively associated with psychological well-being. Further, self-respect was found to partially mediate the relationship between model of self and psychological well-being, but not between model of other and psychological well-being. These results suggest that a positive model of self and of others, and self-respect are important for psychological well-being. These factors are important in the context of growth-fostering relationships in order to improve psychological well-being.","['sexual minority', 'psychological well-being', 'attachment', 'self-respect']"
Unleashing the full cognitive potential of humans: The relationship between objectively manipulated exercise intensity levels on creativity via affect and physical fitness.,"Voort, Jolein van der","['Vries, J. D. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The purpose of this research was to determine if different objectively manipulated exercise intensity levels (i.e., no, low, moderate, and high) were related to different creativity levels. It was expected that moderate intensity was best to increase creativity. Further, it was hypothesized that positive activated affect and affective shift were underlying factors in this relationship. In addition, it was expected that individuals with higher levels of physical fitness reacted with more positive affect to higher exercise intensity which in turn possibly favored their creativity. To test the hypotheses, individuals were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions: no, low, moderate, or high exercise (N = 76). ANOVA and regression analyses were used to analyze the data. A manipulation check revealed that the participants in each condition showed different exercise intensities. This research has shown that the different exercise intensities were not related to different creativity levels. In addition, positive activated affect and affective shift could not explain the relationship between exercise intensity and creativity, and physical fitness did not moderate it. Moderate intensity of exercising, however, led to higher levels of positive affect than low-intensity and no exertion exercising. The research did not find support for the idea that different exercise intensities could predict different creative performance. For future research, it is advised to include other indicators of creativity such as convergent creativity and improve the design of the study by increasing the sample size, enlarging the exercise duration, looking at the retention time and, changing the exercise type.","['Exercise intensity, creativity, physical fitness, affect, experiment']"

The results of the experiment revealed both groups had no difference in their learning curve and reaction times. Contradictory to previous research, the presence of linguistic labels did not enhance concept acquisition or categorical knowledge. Moreover, it was found that the non-label group had greater classification accuracy. This experiment provided evidence to show that linguistic labels do not have the same effect in categorizing abstract objects as it does with simple ones. However, due to the shortcomings of this study such as a small sample size and low generalizability, the findings should not be interpreted without taking these limitations into account. Further replication and evidence is needed to investigate the effect of linguistic labels and the categorization of borderline cases.","['Cognitive Science', 'Categorization']"
Can Novelty Help Us Let Go of Fear? Exploring the Effect of Novelty on Fear Extinction.,"Kerkkänen, Kreeta",['Dr. Judith Schomaker'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Novelty can be defined as a motivationally and attentionally salient learning signal. Past research has found benefits of novelty to include increased plasticity and enhanced memory encoding. Briefly exposing subjects to a novel stimulus or environment in place of an expected threat has also been shown to enhance the extinction process following fear conditioning in both rodents and humans. This is important, as the treatment for trauma-based disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has only been demonstrated effective for up to 66% of those affected and a dysfunction in the fear extinction process appears central in the development and continuation of such disorders. The current study explored whether replacing a fear-inducing stimulus with a novel visual stimulus resulted in more effective fear extinction, as quantified using both subjective and objective parameters, namely subjective arousal, and pupil dilation. In addition, a condition with olfactory novelty was included to explore the effects of contextual novelty on preventing the reinstatement of the conditioned fear 24 hours following fear conditioning. The study successfully established fear conditioning using threatening visual stimuli in a classical conditioning paradigm. However, there was no support for novelty-enhanced fear extinction, nor for the benefit of olfactory novelty on the retention of fear extinction 24 hours post-extinction. Rather, an increase in pupil dilation in the context of a novel olfactory environment was found especially in conditions where a fear-inducing unconditioned stimulus had been paired with a novel replacement stimulus, possibly suggesting a contextual novelty-induced fear reinstatement effect.","['novelty', 'fear extinction']"

Moreover, anxiety symptoms were measured with the Becks Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and level of alcohol use was measured with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Results: Parental bonding significantly predicted anxiety, indicating that an optimal parental bond was negatively related to anxiety symptoms. No significant association between parental bonding and alcohol use was found. Besides that, anxiety and alcohol use showed no significant association. Moreover, no significant mediation effect of anxiety on the relationship between parental bonding and alcohol use was found.

Refugees have more chance of developing psychopathology, which can be explained from the (biosocial) ecological models. Individual and environmental traits influence the development, course and treatment of psychopathology. An unstable environment might cause more stress and mental health issues. The aim of this meta-analysis is to research how effective psychotherapy is for treating PTSD in refugees, and if age as individual factor and language/ cultural adaptation as environmental factor influence the treatment efficacy. Methodology A systematic review with different meta-analyses. Results Systematic researches provided 132 effect sizes within 80 suitable studies. The overall effect size of treating PTSD was significant (Cohen’s d = -0.941, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the mean effect sizes of treating PTSD between children, adolescents and adults. There was no difference in treatment efficacy as a function of the level of language or cultural adaptation found. Discussion and conclusion These results show that psychotherapy significantly lowers PTSD symptoms in refugees. However, our results do not find evidence for the proposed (biosocial) ecological models since age and adaptation are not associated with treatment efficacy. Moreover, there is a large difference in treatment efficacy between refugees and non-refugees, this might be caused by the different structural designs between the studies included in this meta-analysis. Future research should consider these different structural designs and should research more environmental factors that can increase treatment efficacy.","['Refugees', 'PTSD', 'trauma', 'treatment', 'psychotherapy', 'age', 'adaptation']"
The Effect of Openness to Experience on Memory and the Influence of the Novelty Effect,"Jansen, Isle",['David Vogelsang'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Openness to experience is a personality trait that is associated with e.g. creativity, open-mindedness, and curiosity. An individual’s degree of openness to experience affects their cognitive abilities, among which is memory; memory performance has been found to be enhanced in individuals who are high in openness. Sensitivity to novelty is influenced by the degree of openness. Studies in animals have shown that novelty increases memory performances due to the unexpectedness of novelty; this process is mediated by the dopaminergic reward circuits. In the current study, the effect of openness to experience on the novelty effect and memory has been investigated. Adolescents (n = 24) were asked to explore novel and previously familiarised environments, after which words were presented and participants performed an encoding task. Openness to experience was measured with a 4-point Likert scale questionnaire. Results showed a significant correlation between openness and immediate memory recall, although there was no proof of causality in this relationship. The effects of openness on delayed memory, as well as recognition memory in a novel environment, were absent. Our findings suggest that openness does influence sensitivity to novelty and thus affects memory, but further research is needed to assess a causal relationship.","['openness to experience, novelty, memory, novelty effect, episodic memory']"

It is diagnosed based on symptom expression. An ASD diagnosis can influence different aspects of the life of an individual, such as eating and sleeping habits. It may also influence the lives of the people close to the diagnosed individual, especially when diagnosed in children. So far, little is known about how ASD symptom expression influences eating and sleeping patterns in five- year-old children as well as their parent’s parental stress levels. Aim: The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the relationship between ASD symptoms, eating and sleeping problems in five-year-old children, and parental stress. Methods: This thesis used online questionnaires filled out by parents of five-year-old children (n = 4588, Mean age = 5.1, SD = .46) to conduct three multiple regression models. Results: The findings supported the hypotheses (H1) that ASD symptom severity is associated with more problematic eating habits in five-year-old children; (H2) that ASD symptom severity is associated with more sleep problems in five-year-old children; (H3) that ASD symptom severity is associated with more parental stress in parents of five-year- old children. All results were reported with small effect sizes. Conclusion: ASD symptoms in five-year-old children had a small negative effect on eating and sleeping habits in children, and increased parental stress in their parents.","['Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'ASD', 'eating habits', 'sleeping habits', 'parental stress', 'sleeping problems', 'eating problems', 'children', 'five-year-olds']"
"Replicating the Nocebo Effect: Pain Expectancy Exacerbates Pain, but Pain Catastrophizing Lacks Predictive Power","Böhm, Elina","['Nadinda, G.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Pain expectancies have been shown to modify pain perception. The nocebo effect occurs when such expectancies lead to negative outcomes. It has been suggested that pain catastrophizing may act as a predictor of the nocebo effect, but the empirical evidence is inconclusive. This project examined whether expectancies lead to a significant nocebo effect and whether it can be predicted by pain catastrophizing. The project used a 1x2 between-subjects design study, in which pain was induced electrically and expectancies were induced in the active group through a conditioning and verbal suggestion procedure. The active group received different conditioning cues for different kinds of pain. The control group did not receive the same verbal suggestions as the active group and received the same conditioning cues for different kinds of pain. This project analysed the data from 20 healthy participants. The induction of expectancies led to a significant between-groups nocebo effect (p = .018), but pain catastrophizing did not predict this effect (p = .183). These outcomes might be attributed to the relatively small and heterogenous sample. The results of this analysis suggest that manipulating expectancies by impacting the nocebo effect through the modification of intervention expectancies has potential implications for alleviating pain. Nevertheless, because the results on whether pain catastrophizing predicts the nocebo effect were not significant, the extent to which targeting the nocebo effect can be achieved through a manipulation of pain catastrophizing is still uncertain. Consequently, whether pain catastrophizing can predict the nocebo effect warrants further research.","['Nocebo Effect, Pain Catastrophizing, Pain Expectancies, Nocebo Hyperalgesia']"
Understanding the Influence of Financial Scarcity on Cognitive Persistence in an Adult Sample: Insights from an Experimental Approach,"Amaral Filgueiras, Susana","['Ruigendijk, H.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Literature on the impacts of financial scarcity on cognition has demonstrated its detrimental effects in many areas related to executive functions. However, a better understanding of how financial scarcity impacts cognitive persistence in an adult sample is needed. This study investigated whether perceiving oneself in a scarcity situation impacts persistence levels when engaging in a cognitive task. It was hypothesized that the activation of financial scarcity feelings through an experimental task negatively influenced persistence levels in participants who were placed in a scarcity condition. Additionally, it was expected this effect to be stronger for participants who experienced actual financial stress, than for those who currently face no similar concerns. To test these hypotheses, two hundred and one participants engaged in an online study where financial scarcity was activated through an experimental paradigm, namely, the Household task. Persistence levels were assessed with a measure of time and endurance, the Anagram-Riddles task. The findings did not confirm the hypotheses. Although that difference in persistence levels between the groups did not reach statistical significance, the results highlight the importance of assuming the impacts of financial scarcity not only from a deficit model where negative impacts are expected but also from a strengths-based model where adaptive responses serve proximal functions in the context where they take place.","['financial scarcity, persistence, strengths-based model, deficits models.']"

Data from one month before the label implementation of the labelling system and one month after were collected and analysed. The results show no significant differences between the three label groups when analysing a change score between pre- and post-label implementation. However, when combining red and negative labels into a negative label group to raise power, we find marginally significant differences between changes in the positive label group and the negative label group, showing that the intervention may have had a marginally statistically significant negative impact on negative label product purchases. In addition to these findings, our research expresses the importance of policy changes, including climate labels, to influence climate change and explores future avenues for research.","['climate labels', 'environment', 'sustainability', 'carbon labels', 'labelling', 'research', 'consumer buying behaviour', 'Climate Label Intervention', 'Field Research Study']"
Empathie in de schaduw van mishandeling: De invloed van mishandeling in het verleden van ouders op het empathisch vermogen jegens hun eigen kinderen,"Rohde, Femke",['M.S. Tollenaar'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Kindermishandeling kan invloed hebben op psychologisch en biologisch niveau op latere leeftijd, en zo ook op het empathische vermogen. Een goed empathisch vermogen kan een cruciale factor spelen in het ouderschap. In dit onderzoek is daarom onderzocht in welke mate fysieke en emotionele mishandeling in het verleden van ouders een negatieve invloed kan hebben op het empathische vermogen jegens hun kinderen, en welke van de twee een grotere invloed kan hebben. De populatie bestond uit adolescenten (N = 115, meisjes 67.5%, jongens 32.6%) met ieder één of twee ouders (N = 210, moeders 53.9%, vaders 46.1%). Empathie werd gemeten via een reminiscence taak, waarbij de adolescenten een nare ervaring deelden met hun ouders, en hun ouders beoordeelden op begrip, steun en luisterend vermogen. Mishandeling is gemeten via de Jeugd Trauma Vragenlijst. De analyse is uitgevoerd via een multipele regressieanalyse. Het is gebleken dat fysieke en emotionele mishandeling in het verleden van ouders een significant negatief verband hebben met empathie (β = -0.29, p = 0.002). Hoe meer mishandeling ouders hadden meegemaakt, hoe minder empathie er dus gerapporteerd werd. Bovendien is gebleken dat fysieke mishandeling een sterker negatief verband heeft met empathie (β = -0.33, p = 0.003) dan emotionele mishandeling (β = -0.02, p = -0.85). Fysieke mishandeling leidt dus tot minder empathie dan emotionele mishandeling. Kindermishandeling heeft invloed op een belangrijke factor binnen het ouderschap. Door uitdagingen te identificeren, waarmee ouders die mishandeld zijn worden geconfronteerd, zouden interventies gemaakt kunnen worden om hun mentale gesteldheid te bevorderen, en om de ontwikkeling van een goed empathisch vermogen te ondersteunen van zowel ouders als kinderen.",

How Demographic Variables Influence the Protestant Work Ethic,"Savchev, Victor","['Simpson-Kent, I.L.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The concept of the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE) was proposed in 1905 and its key features are hard work, asceticism, and success. The main unanswered question in the context of PWE is its relation to demographic variables. Relationships between PWE and demographic variables are still not clear. The current study aims to answer the research question: “How do demographic variables influence the Protestant Work Ethic?” To address this question, the thesis proposes a single-factor model of PWE, which is assessed on five demographic variables: formal education, age, family size, marital status, and religion. Groups were created for each of the five variables in order to assess their relationship with PWE. For the statistical analysis, multigroup structural equation modeling (SEM) was used and measurement invariance was evaluated in order to account for the differences between the groups. Based on the academic literature five hypotheses were created on the basis of model fit, factor loadings, and predicted factor scores. Only two of the hypotheses were partially supported (religion and family size) due to consistently higher factor loadings. Patterns were observed across most of the groups. Lower-educated participants exhibit distaste for leisure time, while more educated participants tend to be more hard-working. Religious people tend to endorse PWE less. Participants with more siblings endorse PWE more. Young participants tend to be more success-oriented, compared to single participants and middle-aged participants who are more hardworking. Future research should be focused on the area of demographics, the differences between religions in the context of a multidimensional factor model of PWE, and testing measurement invariance.","['PWE', 'hard work', 'ethics', 'demographic variables', 'education', 'religion', 'family size', 'marital status', 'age', 'SEM', 'factor model', 'model fit', 'factor loadings', 'factor score', 'measurement invariance']"

A growing number of research presents empirical evidence for the negative psychological consequences of the lockdowns, such as increased anxiety and stress. However, the long-term mental effects, especially on children and their parents, are unclear and need to be further investigated. Aims This paper aims to examine whether there is a difference in the levels of anxious and shy behaviour in five-year-old children and in parental stress in their parents due to the pandemic. Method The data was collected as part of the ""Jij en Je Gezondheid"" project, executed by the Gemeentelijke Gezondheidsdiensten region. Inclusion criteria included children around the age of five and their parents who live in Amsterdam. Independent samples t-test was run to investigate whether there is a difference in anxious and shy behaviour in the children and parental stress before and after the COVID lockdowns. Results Levels of anxious and shy behaviour were higher after the COVID lockdowns in children as compared to the before lockdowns group. Parental stress was reported to also increase after the COVID lockdowns. Conclusions The study emphasizes the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on children’s anxious and shy behaviour and their parents' stress levels. The findings highlight the need for tailored interventions for families to decrease the long-term psychological burden of the pandemic, as well as additional research to fully understand the problem.","['COVID-19', 'lockdowns', 'children', 'parental stress', 'anxiety', 'shyness']"

Suicide is a self-destructive behaviour as it is a direct attack and the involvement of the self is not investigated. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate this. Paranoia stems from an excess of mistrust and can disrupt connections between people. Previous research on the connection between paranoid thinking, social connectedness and suicidal ideation suggests that social connectedness is important for trust and lower levels of social connectedness could be associated with the development of suicidality. Objective: This study aims to investigate the relationship between social connectedness and suicidal ideation and the influence of paranoid thinking on this relationship. Method: This cross-sectional study included 132 participants of which 107 participants were used in the analysis. The data was analysed using a Pearson correlation and a hierarchical regression analysis in IBM SPSS 27 using the Social Connectedness Scale-Revised, the Revised Green et al. Paranoid Thoughts Scale and the Suicidal Ideation Attribute Scale. Results: Our analysis showed a negative relationship between social connectedness and suicidal ideation with significant interaction with paranoid thinking. Both of these findings supported our hypotheses. Which was consistent with previous research. Conclusion: This study was inclusive and recruited enough participants for a strong analysis, however, there was a possibility of sampling bias and lack of generalizability. These findings indicate the importance of looking into these factors in more depth and their influence on mental health outcomes.","['Social connectedness', 'Suicidality', 'Suicidal ideation', 'Paranoid thinking']"

This state of scarcity manifests itself in individuals through alterations in cognitive functioning and decision-making. This situation affects individual on different levels, depending on available resources and contextual means. This research is concerned about the role of personality traits, particularly impulsivity, on decision-making under situations of scarcity. Prior research has found that impulsivity affects decision-making, manifesting itself in rash action and impulsive behavior. Here, we apply these findings and discuss the degree of impulsivity and its moderating role in the relationship of financial scarcity and risk preference. This effect was investigated through a multiple-scaled questionnaire. One task, the lottery choice task, and two scales, the Psychological Inventory of Financial Scarcity (PIFS) and a shortened version of the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-15), were administered and utilized for the analysis. A total of 100 participants based in United Kingdom were involved in the questionnaire. The results yield no significance between impulsivity and the relationship of financial scarcity and risk preference. Future research may look deeper into cultural differences and biases that may be involved in the decision-making process, as well as looking into different instruments that measures the trait impulsivity itself.","['financial scarcity', 'risk preference', 'impulsivity', 'decision-making', 'personality traits']"

The Impact of Informative Intervention Campaigns on Food Waste Intention: Investigating the Moderating Role of Financial Income,"Xu, Caihua","['Brizi, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Food waste phenomenon had continually been a serious economic, environmental, and social problem globally, and various organizations were trying to intervene, and fundamentally solving the problem by letting more people to be aware and pay strong attention to this problem by generating informative intervention campaigns. These campaigns had been proven to be effective in reducing food waste intention and behavior (Soma et al., 2020). In addition, studies had shown that the population with a higher financial income tends to produce more food waste due to the food accessibility and the lack of awareness or urgency to reduce food waste. By conducting a survey via Qualtrics including 155 employed participants based in the Netherlands, the aim of this study was to understand if the informative intervention campaigns would reduce the food waste intentions and if this relationship is moderated by the income. After running a moderation test, no significant relationship was found for different incomes, however, the significant effect of informative intervention campaigns on the food waste intention was successfully replicated. We discussed the potential reasons for the non-significant effect, and we concluded some suggestions for future implications and how to improve the current study.","['Food waste', 'Income', 'Intervention campaigns', 'Food waste awareness']"
How financial scarcity drives risk-seekers and the potential for the illusory control bias,"Stonham, Sanya",['Leon Hilbert'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The subjective experience of financial scarcity has gained conceptual significance in the past decade, expanding from the objective perspective of poverty. Scarcity theory entails that having a scarcity mindset leads to counterproductive economic decisions that cycle the poverty trap. Therefore, the consequences of decisions made under uncertainty require investigation. The following study hypothesized whether financial scarcity increases the willingness to take risks and whether the effect is mediated by a type of positivity bias known as the illusion of control. Risk has multiple dimensions and is measured mainly as risk preferences and risk tolerance in the study. Each variable is measured in a questionnaire to British participants through an online query called Prolific (N = 100). The preliminary findings of the study indicated a positive relationship between financial scarcity and risk preferences, considering the influence of age and gender, though not when analyzed independently. Significant positive associations were discovered between financial scarcity and both risk tolerance and the illusion of control, aligning with initial expectations. Although the current line of research did not directly explore a mediation effect, it remained plausible that a weak effect might exist. Future studies are encouraged to acknowledge the problem of risk heterogeneity and focus on factors such as cognitive ability and emotions on financial scarcity to comprehend the dynamics at play.","['Subjective financial scarcity', 'risk preference', 'risk tolerance', 'risk heterogeneity', 'positivity bias', 'illusion of control']"
Exercising your way through trauma: The protecting effect of exercise on trauma in childhood,"Hellegers, Fenna",['Nina Komrij'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Approximately 46% of all children experience a traumatic event while growing up. Trauma can adversely affect several domains of a child’s life, influencing their overall quality of life. However, most children do not experience long-lasting adverse effects. Behavioral inhibition is expected to influence differences between children regarding the adverse effects of trauma. Previous research shows that exercise-based therapies could form an alternative treatment option for children who experienced trauma but cannot find appropriate help from the current mental healthcare system due to existing barriers. However, not enough research has been done to include such therapies in the regulated treatment options. To contribute to this research gap, the moderating effect of exercise on the mediation relationship between trauma, quality of life, and behavioral inhibition was examined. Data for this research originates from a project carried out by Gemeentelijke Gezondheidsdiensten Amsterdam called ‘Jij en Je Gezondheid’, aiming to register children’s health and well-being and adjust their healthcare accordingly. Parents (n= 10957) filled in questionnaires about their 10-year-old child, measuring trauma, behavioral inhibition, quality of life, and exercise. This research had a cross-sectional design. A moderated-mediation analysis was performed to test the hypotheses. Results show that children who experience trauma have a lower reported quality of life (β = -1.946, p < .001) with a medium effect size (d= -.56). Moreover, behavior inhibition appeared to mediate this relationship (-.141, SE = .041, 95% CI[-.223, -.059]), but the effect size was small (d = -.04). Therefore, there was insufficient evidence for behavior inhibition as mediator. Overall, exercise did not significantly moderate the mediated relationship between trauma, behavioral inhibition, and quality of life (-.029, SE = .025, 95% CI[-.076, .021]). However, when children exercised an average (-.141, SE =.041, 95% CI[-.220, -.059])or high (-.189, SE =.057, 95% CI[-.297, -.079])amount, the relationship was significant. These results amplify the importance of guiding children who experience trauma to reduce adverse outcomes. It also suggests that exercise-based programs may influence the well-being of children who have experienced trauma. However, further research is crucial before implementing exercise-based interventions within the regular treatment.","['trauma, bavioral inhibition, quality of life, exercise, moderated-mediation model, JEJG']"

Door middel van een online vragenlijst, afgenomen bij 59 ouders, is de ouderbetrokkenheid gemeten. De ouderbetrokkenheid werd gemeten aan de hand van de drie deelaspecten: literaire middelen, leesactiviteiten en de leesattitude van de ouder. Aan de hand van de resultaten zijn een totaalscore en scores op de deelaspecten berekend. De betrouwbaarheid van de vragenlijst is gemeten, waaruit naar voren kwam dat de totaalscore een betere betrouwbaarheid gaf dan de losse deelaspecten. Hierdoor is vooral gekeken naar de totaalscore bij het doen van verdere analyses. De algehele ouderbetrokkenheid bij lezen op basisschool X bevond zich boven het gemiddelde. Echter viel op dat de participanten lager scoorden op twee items: bibliotheekbezoeken en praten over boeken. Om de ouderbetrokkenheid bij lezen op basisschool X te verhogen zal ingezet moeten worden op deze twee activiteiten. Ook viel op dat in dit onderzoek geen verschil gevonden is in ouderbetrokkenheid tussen de onderbouw en de bovenbouw, in tegenstelling tot bestudeerde literatuur. Het is mogelijk dat deze activiteiten en de afwezigheid van het verschil tussen de onder- en bovenbouw ook vindbaar is in de Nederlandse populatie. De hoge score op ouderbetrokkenheid kan te maken hebben met de hoge sociaaleconomische status van de wijk en de sociale wenselijkheid van de vragenlijst.

Despite taking 15 minutes to apply, using BICAMS as an assessment considered time-consuming. Previous studies suggested using the Signal Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) in case the BICAMS administration is too challenging (e.g., limited time or lack of experts). In this study, the BICAMS and SDMT alone were compared in a real-life sample population of MS to assist the neurologist in selecting the most appropriate neuropsychological screening for identifying patients with cognitive decline at the earliest convenience. According to the Chi-square analysis, 7.2% of patients were wrongly categorized based on SDMT alone. On the contrary, an intact SDMT corresponded 100% with an intact BICAMS. Therefore, it was concluded that BICAMS as a whole is a better screening tool than SDMT alone for detecting cognitive impairment in PwMS. This study was also interested in identifying the main predictors of cognitive decline. According to the results of the univariate and multivariate regression analysis, lower education level and higher EDSS scores of the patients were found to be predictors of lower BICAMS scores.","['Multiple sclerosis, cognitive impairment, BICAMS, SDMT, screening instrument']"

Verschillen in Emotieverwerking Tussen Autistische Jongens en Antisociale Jongens met Psychopathische Trekken. Speelt Empathie Hierbij een Modererende Rol?,"Woltjer, Esmee","['Aghajani, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Background: Emotion recognition is essential for social functioning and communication. Research has shown that when adolescents with conduct disorder (CD) also show high callous-unemotional traits (CU+), they are slower in recognizing negative emotions. Moreover, adolescents with CD/CU+ are limited in affective empathy and they are less fearful of punishment. On the other hand, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with a lesser ability to recognize emotions of others in an accurate manner. Besides that, in contrast to CD/CU+, they are impaired in the cognitive aspects of empathy. Aim: This study aims to gain knowledge regarding emotion recognition of adolescents, diagnosed with either ASD or CD/CU+. Specifically, this study focuses on the speed and accuracy negative emotions are recognized with. Additionally, the relationship between diagnostics and emotional processing is researched, and whether cognitive or affective empathy moderate this relationship. The latter aspect has not been studied yet in current literature. Method: The sample consisted of 48 boys between 15 and 19 years (M = 17.2), either boys with ASD (N = 23) or boys with CD/CU+ (N = 25). Using a socio-emotional computer task, fearful and angry faces were presented, and participants were requested to recognize the emotional state. Results: In contrast to earlier findings, results showed that emotion recognition accuracy did not differ between boys with CD/CU+ and boys with ASD. However, there was a difference found in reaction time: boys with CD/CU+ showed a faster reaction time to angry faces than boys with ASD. Finally, empathy did not moderate the relationship between diagnostics and emotion recognition. Conclusion: It can be concluded that boys with CD/CU+ and ASD recognize angry emotions differently. Although further research is recommended, this study emphasizes the importance of adjusting interventions to specific abilities and impairments of the individual, which can increase the efficacy.","['Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Callous-unemotional traits', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Emotion Recognition', 'Empathy.']"

This study is part of ‘RESIST’; a longitudinal study where the development of antisocial behaviour is studied from late childhood to early adulthood. All the participants have been in contact with the police, for committing an offence, before the age of twelve. Objective. The aim of this study is two- fold. Firstly, to investigate the development of antisocial behaviour from late childhood to early adulthood. Secondly, to investigate the social demographic characteristics whether they act as risk factors or protective factors to the desistance or persistence of antisocial behaviour. Methods. The main study consisted of five main time points. This thesis investigated three main time- points (TP): TP1; late childhood (N=298), TP4; adolescence (N=150), and TP5 early adulthood (N=73). Standard psychological instruments were used to investigate antisocial behaviour (DISC-IV, MINI and ASR) as well as the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants (SAHA). The desistance or persistence of antisocial behaviour from late childhood to early adulthood was statistically investigated using Repeated Measures ANOVA. Correlation and regression analysis are used to investigate whether there is a relationship and effect between these sociodemographic characteristics and the development of antisocial behaviour. Results. From late childhood (M=11.74) to adolescence (M=5.94) there is a statistically significant decrease of antisocial behaviour (F (1, 59) = 15.68, p < .001). Three main trajectories are outlined (1) the majority of the childhood- onset offenders desist from antisocial behaviour by the time they are adolescents, (2) only a small percentage persist up to their early adolescence and (3) a percentage persist up to their adulthood. Being associated with delinquent peers (β = 0.63, t = 0.36, p= 0.03) significantly predicts antisocial behaviour in adulthood. While, high parental supervision (β = 0.45, t = 2.8, p= 0.01) significantly predicts having an ASPD Diagnosis in adulthood. Additionally, a negative linear relationship between parental warmth and ASPD symptoms in adulthood was found. (r = -0.26, p= 0.04). Conclusion. These findings help to provide information on patterns of how early onset of delinquent behaviour progresses and develops over time. Furthermore, it also sheds light that delinquent peers and parental supervision act as a risk factor for persistence of antisocial behaviour. Whilst parental warmth acts as a protective factor for the desistance of antisocial behaviour. These findings aid interventions to be more specific and effective.","['Antisocial behaviour trajectories', 'persistence', 'desistance', 'early onset']"

Studying the relationship between adverse life events and mental health outcomes in students,"Groenhof, Kai",['Eiko Fried'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Research into Adverse Life Events (ALE) is rarely focused on students. ALE are a common experience among students and may have significant effects on mental health outcomes such as depression, anxiety, stress, and lifetime depression. In this study we use multiple measures for ALE, which assess several types of ALE, including life trauma, childhood trauma, bullying, childhood adversities and negative life experiences. These outcomes are measured by the PHQ-9, GAD-7, PSS-10 and the LIDAS. This study investigated the relationships between ALE and these mental health outcomes, together with the predictive role of childhood trauma, negative life experiences, being bullied and childhood adversities by using multiple regression. In addition, we explored the role of gender as a control variable and conducted an exploratory network analysis. A multicohort study provided data from a sample of 449 Dutch higher education students who completed self-report measures of mental health outcomes and ALE experiences. The results showed that negative life events are significant predictors for all four mental health outcomes. Childhood trauma predicted depression, lifetime depression and stress, and life trauma were predictive of depression. Overall, these findings were supported by network analysis. They suggest that negative life events may be more impactful to current mental health than life trauma, and that both can have a lasting impact on the mental health of students. The implications and alternative explanations for these findings are discussed, together with suggestions for future research.","['adverse life events, students, mental health, trauma, network analysis, depression, anxiety, stress']"
“Is it secret? Is it safe?”: Implicit Behavioral Rules as factor of Psychological Safety in Healthcare,"Hermida, Juliette","['Groeneweg, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Human factors remain a key contributor to patient harm. However, healthcare organizations struggle to learn from mistakes, hindering the reduction of medical errors. Psychological safety (PS) enhances team functioning and reduce medical errors by stimulating open communication and giving and receiving feedback while a punitive working culture can lower PS, leading to decreased team performance and increased patient harm. Similar to a punitive working culture, when group norms (GN) are present, non-normative behavior can lead to rejection, causing physical and emotional distress that could undermine PS. This study therefore explores the impact of GN on PS. This study examined the impact of GN on PS using qualitative and quantitative methods. Different outcomes were observed when analyzing the impact of GN on PS, depending on whether a homogeneous or heterogeneous dataset was used. The homogeneous dataset showed no relationship between PS and GN, while the heterogeneous dataset indicated a significant positive correlation. The study had some limitations, including a small sample size and the use of self-constructed surveys to assess GN. Despite the non-significant results in the homogeneous dataset, the role of GN in evaluating PS should not be disregarded. Future research should focus on exploring the influence of GN on PS and address methodological challenges associated with studying implicit behavioral rules. In conclusion, understanding the impact of GN on PS is crucial for improving patient safety in healthcare settings. By addressing the limitations of this study and conducting further research, healthcare organizations can develop interventions to enhance PS, reduce medical errors, and create a culture of safety.","['Group Norms, Implicit Behavioral Rules, Psychological Safety, Healthcare']"
The potential role of generic and specific outcome expectations on areas of functioning in patients with Bechterew’s disease following a proof-of-concept training program based on the Wim Hof Method,"Sievers, Heike Verena","['Middendorp, H. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Outcome expectations play a role in the functioning of people with different immune-mediated conditions, like Bechterew’s disease, and could strengthen or convey similar effects of regular long-term therapy. The Wim Hof Method has shown promising results with regards to its effect on clinical, autonomic and immune response to experimentally induced inflammation. The current study aims to investigate the relationship between generic (optimism/neuroticism) and specific outcome expectations (related to training effects on health) with the functioning of patients with Bechterew’s disease. In this proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial with a cross-sectional design, 24 patients were included, who followed an adapted version of the Wim Hof Method. During this intervention, a number of areas of functioning variables were included: quality of life, anxiety, depression, and disease activity. These were measured at baseline, week 4, week 8, and a follow-up meeting at week 24. When assessing the relationship between generic and specific treatment outcome expectations, it was found that, higher levels of neuroticism are related more positive specific outcome expectations (r = .414, p = .044). It was seen that better functioning in one area was associated with better functioning in some other areas (r = .434, p < .001, r = .836, p < .001). Regarding the influence of each treatment outcome expectation separately on the different areas of functioning, neuroticism was associated with higher disease activity before and after treatment, as well as more anxiety before treatment (r = .470, p = .018, r = .567, p = .05, r = .253, p = .05). Optimism and specific treatment outcome expectations were not significantly related to functioning. Also, when the influence of baseline functioning was assessed, only the levels of depression before treatment were predictive for depression after treatment (beta = .714, p = .027). When treatment outcome expectations were taken together, they were not significant predictors for functioning after treatment. This study provides limited indications for the importance of treatment outcome expectations for alternative treatment methods. However, neuroticism plays a role in worse functioning and could be used to predict treatment response, and its influence could be addressed through neuroticism management.","['Bechterew’s disease, outcome expectations (optimism/neuroticism/specific), Wim Hof, inflammation']"
Does threat make you want to help? The effect of incident severity and social identity on the cardiovascular responses of bystanders.,"Dimosiaris, Evangelos","['Scheepers, D.T.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"While the traditional bystander effect literature suggested that the presence of bystanders leads to less help provided to the victims, recent studies that focused on dangerous incidents provided evidence for decreased or even reversed bystander effect in the presence of bystanders. Although previous research proposed that the heightened arousal experienced by bystanders during dangerous incidents with in-group victims leads to increased assistance, empirical evidence supporting this claim remains limited and difficult to be studied with self-report measurements. This study addresses these limitations by employing the biopsychological model of challenge and threat (BPS-CT) to examine empirically the physiological reactions of bystanders. Participants were exposed to vignettes describing dangerous and non-dangerous incidents involving in-group and out-group victims, while their cardiovascular activity and blood pressure were measured. The presence of bystanders was found to have a marginal impact on reducing threat among bystanders, irrespective of the incident's severity. Moreover, in dangerous incidents, the presence of other bystanders and a shared in-group identity with the victim heightened participants' sense of challenge. The findings align with previous meta-analytic evidence, highlighting that bystanders are more likely to intervene in dangerous situations. The results are discussed and possible implications are proposed for designing intervention programs aimed at increasing bystander intervention rates.","['Bystander effect', 'Physiology', 'Incident severity', 'Social identity']"
The Relationship between Cognitive Impairment and Psychological Status in People with Multiple Sclerosis,"Toubassi, Talin","['Hulst, H.E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) often experience symptoms that can have a significant impact on psychological and cognitive functioning. Research has previously shown a significant association between these two functions. The aim of this paper was to study the association between psychological factors (depression and fatigue) and cognitive functions (memory, verbal fluency, and information processing speed). Studying fatigue, depressed mood, and the combination between them can provide important indications to how psychological status relates to cognitive functioning. Cognitive functions of memory, verbal fluency, and information processing speed were measured through Buschke Selective Reminding test, Controlled Oral Word Association test, and the Symbol Digit Modalities test, respectively. Depressed mood was measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and fatigue was measured with the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions. Patients (N=124; mean age = 50.77 [SD = 13.5]; 25% male, 93% female; 9.7% PPMS, 28.5% SPMS, 61.3% RRMS) were categorized into four groups based on their depression and fatigue scores using clinical cut-offs (i.e., psychologically intact [no depressive mood, not fatigued], depressive mood but not fatigued, fatigued but no depressive mood, and psychologically impaired [depressive mood and fatigued]). Group did significantly differ on MS type (p < .05), Group 1 (psychologically intact) and Group 4 (no depressive mood but fatigued) were more likely to have a relapse-remitting disease course. However, findings suggest no significant association between group and cognitive functioning. Scores on the cognitive tests were similar across all groups (p = .203). This indicates that cognitive functioning is independent of psychological status. However, in light of the limitations, it is important to build on future studies to investigate this relationship further, to indicate a next step in the treatment and intervention of MS in terms of psychological problems, cognitive deficits, or both.","['Multiple sclerosis', 'cognitive impairment', 'psychological status', 'depression', 'fatigue', 'verbal fluency', 'information processing speed', 'memory']"

The Effects of Decreasing Social Networking Site Use on Mental Health: An Experimental Study,"Eggers, Niklas","['Vandenbroucke, A.R.E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social Networking Sites (SNS) can be valuable tools to connect people with shared interests worldwide. However, SNS screentime has increased drastically over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excessive use of SNS has been associated with adverse mental health outcomes in previous studies. Contrary to the majority of studies on SNS, which usually rely on correlations, this study used an experimental approach to examine the relationship between SNS use, depression, and anxiety. Fear of missing out (FOMO) was also investigated as a potential mediating factor. To manipulate SNS screentime a multifaceted intervention was built based on results from previous experimental studies and input from a focus group (N = 3). A convenience sample of first year psychology students (N = 122) had been collected and split into three groups. The intervention group was instructed to follow the smartphone use intervention, while participants in the active-control group received instructions with little expected influence on screentime. Both groups were instructed to reduce their smartphone use as much as possible for two weeks. The waitlist-control group was told their intervention would begin in two weeks. SNS screentime, anxiety, depression and FOMO were assessed pre- and post-intervention. The results show significantly lower post-intervention SNS screentime in both intervention groups but not in the waitlist-control group. Depression scores were significantly lower in the intervention group but not for the active-control or waitlist-control condition. No significant group differences for anxiety were found. The mediation analysis obtained no significant results for FOMO as a potential mediator variable. Overall, the findings suggest participants reduced their smartphone usage regardless of the received set of rules. However, only participants in the intervention group showed fewer depressive symptoms. Limitations and suggestions for future research on SNS use were discussed.","['social media', 'social networking sites', 'intervention', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'fear of missing out']"

Present study investigates whether an abbreviated dynamic test would be a viable instrument to help teachers measure the instructional needs for children with a DLD. Pupils who participated (N = 66, M = 9.5 years, SD = 0.53) took an abbreviated dynamic test consisting of a 12-item analogy task. A hierarchical graduated prompt training (metacognitive, cognitive or modelling) was given to a student whom answered incorrectly. In addition, the teachers were given a questionnaire consisting of questions about pupil’s language development and current school results. First, the relationship between language development, teachers rating of instructional needs and school results was measured. A positive and significant relation was found in which children with a higher language development needed less instructions and had higher school results. Second, the relationship between language development and instructional needs on the abbreviated dynamic test were measured. It was found that children with a slower language development needed more and different kinds of graduated prompts during the dynamic test, showing a different need for instruction. Lastly the predictive value of the abbreviated dynamic test in combination with language development was measured. The abbreviated dynamic test in combination with language development is found to be a significant and strong predictor for math scores on Cito. In conclusion, it is possible to use an abbreviated dynamic test with standardized graduated prompts to measure the instructional needs of children with a language development disorder.","['Dynamisch testen, taalontwikkelingsstoornis, taalontwikkeling, schoolresultaten']"

Met een beetje 'awe' zou studeren een stuk leuker worden! Een studie over de mogelijke rol van ‘dispositional awe’ in het verhogen van intrinsieke academische motivatie van universitaire studenten na de COVID-19 pandemie.,"Douma, Lois","['Akyüz, R.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Na de COVID-19-pandemie is de academische motivatie van universitaire studenten drastisch gedaald. Dit is onder andere te verklaren door een verlaagd gevoel van relatedness met medestudenten tijdens het onlineonderwijs, zoals beschreven in de Self-Determination Theory (SDT), en een daarmee gepaard gaand verlaagd mentaal welzijn. De nog weinig onderzochte emotie ‘awe’ blijkt een positieve invloed te hebben op het mentale welzijn en kan mogelijk een rol spelen in dit probleem. Awe is een emotie die wordt gekenmerkt door een overweldigend gevoel van verwondering. De mate waarin individuen verschillen in de neiging tot het ervaren van awe wordt ook wel ‘dispositional awe’ genoemd. In dit onderzoek is er gekeken naar de relatie tussen dispositional awe en academische motivatie, specifiek intrinsieke motivatie. De steekproef bestaat uit universitaire studenten (n = 206) in de leeftijdscategorie 18-30 jaar. Aan de hand van een vragenlijst werd onderzocht of de mate van de ervaring van awe invloed heeft op de mate van intrinsieke academische motivatie. Vervolgens werd er gekeken of mentaal welzijn een mediërend effect heeft op deze relatie. Op basis van de literatuur werd een positieve relatie verwacht tussen awe en totale en intrinsieke academische motivatie. Correlatie- en lineaire regressieanalyses ondersteunen deze verwachtingen. Verder werd er verwacht dat ‘mentaal welzijn’ een mediërend effect had op de relatie tussen awe en intrinsieke academische motivatie. Een multipele regressieanalyse bevestigt deze hypothese. Uit deze studie blijkt aldus dat de neiging tot het ervaren van awe bij kan dragen aan de intrinsieke academische motivatie van universitaire studenten, wat gedeeltelijk wordt verklaard door mentaal welzijn.","['awe', 'dispositional awe', 'academic motivation', 'mental wellbeing, Self-Determination Theory (SDT)']"
Parental Beliefs and Shared Reading: A Review of the Comparison between Print and Digital Books,"Chan, Sonia","['Vermeer, H.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In recent decades, the integration of digital media into early childhood literacy practices has gained prominence. However, research indicates that despite the varied benefits of shared digital book reading for parent-child dyads, only a small percentage of families incorporate digital books into their shared reading routines. This narrative review aims to explore the differences in parental beliefs regarding shared reading between print and digital books. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of ten studies published between 2012 and 2023 that examined parental beliefs and shared reading involving these two different book formats. Through our literature analysis, we identified four themes that encapsulate parents' distinct beliefs about shared reading with print and digital books (i.e., functionality, mediating role, cognitive and emotional engagement, norms and preferences). According to the parents in our study, print books are perceived as educational tools supporting language and literacy development, while digital books are viewed primarily as sources of entertainment. Parents play a more active role in mediating shared reading with print books, while digital books are seen as more self-sufficient. Print books foster deep cognitive and emotional engagement, while concerns arise regarding potential distractions and overstimulation with digital books. Overall, parental beliefs and preferences about shared reading are influenced by the societal norms and parents’ past experiences. Understanding these parental beliefs is crucial for educators and storybook developers, as it informs the design of effective and engaging reading experiences for young children in both print and digital formats.",

Leerlingen voelen zich niet altijd veilig en daarom is de school op zoek naar handvatten voor een veiliger schoolklimaat. Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: Wat kunnen leerkrachten van multiculturele basisschool de Meerpaal doen om een veiliger klimaat te creëren voor de groepen 4 tot en met 8? Acht leerkrachten hebben een online vragenlijst ingevuld die verdeeld was over vijf onderwerpen: Positive Behavior Support, schoolbeleid, omgaan met gedrag, klassenmanagement en ouder-leerkrachtrelatie. Deze onderwerpen sluiten aan bij drie theorieën, namelijk het behaviorisme, de sociale leertheorie en de zelfdeterminatietheorie. Daarnaast zijn er vragen gesteld over de schoolregels en zijn er een aantal open vragen gesteld. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat het gemiddelde van de vijf onderwerpen hoog is, maar dat er toch enkele aandachtspunten zijn. De resultaten laten zien dat van de subcategorieën positief, veilig en voorspelbaar klimaat, een positief klimaat het laagste gemiddelde heeft. Daarnaast geven leerkrachten aan dat er een eenduidig plan moet komen voor de school. Het wordt aanbevolen dat leerkrachten van basisschool de Meerpaal sociaalemotionele vaardigheden bij leerlingen aanleren en sociale relaties bevorderen, bijvoorbeeld door middel van een methode. Daarnaast is het belangrijk dat alle leerkrachten op de hoogte zijn van het schoolbeleid en hier ook achter staan. Ook wordt aangeraden om aandacht te besteden aan positief gedrag en gewenst gedrag te stimuleren, bijvoorbeeld door middel van een schoolbreed beloningssysteem. Eventueel vervolgonderzoek kan zich richten op een passende manier voor het omgaan met ongewenst gedrag.","['Schoolklimaat', 'Positive Behavior Support', 'schoolbeleid', 'omgaan met gedrag', 'klassenmanagement', 'ouder-leerkrachtrelatie']"

However, it remains unclear which factors are associated with the treatment outcomes. Previous studies on various factors have yielded contradictory results. This research has investigated whether the following factors: combat trauma exposure (CTE), sexual trauma exposure (STE), number of traumatic events (NoTE) and pre-treatment PTSD symptom severity scores (PPSSS), were associated with treatment outcomes in the five-day High Intensive Trauma Treatment (HITT) programme. A total of 279 patients received daily psycho-education, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), Imaginary Exposure (IE), exposure in vivo exercises and trauma-informed yoga. Pre-treatment and post- treatment PTSD symptom scores were compared using the Posttraumatic Checklist for DSM- 5 (PCL-5). A multiple regression analysis was performed. A medium pre-treatment to post- treatment effect size was reported (Cohen’s d = 0.76). The results indicated a non-significant regression model (F(4,207) = 0.650, p = .627). None of the four factors investigated were found to be significant predictors of treatment outcome. This research indicated that CTE, STE, NoTE and PPSSS, were not associated with treatment outcomes in the HITT programme. Contrary to other studies, this research has shown that these factors do not interfere with the beneficial outcomes of intensive therapy. This is a promising result for patients who are affected by these factors. Further research should include a control group and gather follow-up data.","['PTSD, intensive treatment, combat trauma, sexual trauma, symptom severity scores, traumatic events, treatment outcome']"
De intergenerationele overdracht van traumasymptomen van ouders op hun kinderen en de invloed van gender,"Fink, Luisa","['Swart, E.K.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"There is little scientific research on the intergenerational transmission of trauma from parents to their offspring in violent households. There is also little knowledge about the importance of the gender of both the parents and the children in intergenerational trauma. It is important to find out more about influential factors on intergenerational trauma to be able to shape trauma treatment. This study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between the trauma symptoms of the parents and the trauma symptoms of their child. Further, there is investigated whether the gender of the child and the gender of the parents have a significant effect on intergenerational transmission of trauma. The sample consisted of 800 families with information about at least one parent (167 fathers and 633 mothers) and one child (397 boys and 403 girls). The parents’ age ranged from 18 to 55 years old (M= 3.90; SD= .81). The children were between 1 and 18 years old (M= 7.46; SD= 3.56). The following questionnaires were used: The trauma Symptoms Inventory (TSI), Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children (TSCYC), and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC). Results showed that the trauma symptoms of parents were a good predictor of the child’s trauma symptoms. Both the gender of the child and the gender of parents did not affect the intergenerational transmission of trauma symptoms from parents to their child. The results of the present study show that secondary trauma symptoms are a factor to consider in the treatment of trauma symptoms. More scientific research is needed to confirm the results of this study. Follow-up research must also focus on other influential factors, such as culture, resilience, and parenting style.","['Traumasymptomen, intergenerationele overdracht, gender']"
The Effect of Machiavellianism on Attacker Exploitation in an Economic Contest Game,"de Rijke, Fleur",['Lennart Reddmann'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"People who score high on the personality trait Machiavellianism do not shy away from exploiting others for their own benefit. Here, we investigated the effect of Machiavellianism on attacker exploitation. We hypothesized that attackers high on Machiavellianism will exploit their economic opponent and thus invest more into conflict. To test our hypothesis, we used the economic Attacker-Defender Contest (AD-C), an experimental game created for studying conflict. In the game, if the attacker invests more into conflict than the defender, they take what the defender had left after they invested, hereby exploiting the defender. In an online experiment, 301 participants completed the AD-C as either an attacker or a defender. We assessed Machiavellianism by means of the Short Dark Triad (SD3) measure. A simple linear regression led to the conclusion that Machiavellianism is unrelated to attacker conflict investment. Interestingly, we did find an effect of Machiavellianism on attackers’ expectation of the defenders’ conflict investment. Attackers’ expectation, in turn, strongly affected conflict investment. The effect of Machiavellianism on expected investment connects to previous research, showing that Machiavellianism evokes expectations of selfish feelings in others. However, the concrete reason as to why Machiavellianism relates to expectation, but not conflict investment, remains unclear. Recommendations for future research include conducting research in an economic organization.","['Machiavellianism, economic contest game, exploitation, attacker']"

Other-Affirmation within Organizations: Examining the Role of Trust and Personality,"Moens, Annelotte",['dr.

Therefore, strategies that increase the level of trust experienced by employees should be examined. Other-affirmation is a mediation strategy that promotes positive thoughts about the counterpart’s qualities. The current study examined whether other-affirmative techniques facilitated by managers increased employees’ levels of job satisfaction and decreased the occurrence of conflict, and if trust had a mediating role in these findings. Furthermore, the possibility of personality (Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) as a moderator on the relationship between other-affirmation and trust was investigated. The sample consisted of 58 participants (19 managers and 39 employees) that were recruited through our social network, approaching organizations, and through online channels (e.g. LinkedIn). All participants filled out an online questionnaire that corresponded to their organizational role of ‘manager’ or ‘employee’. The results of the mediation analysis showed that other-affirmation increased job satisfaction levels of the employee and trust mediated this relationship. Moderation analyses showed that Extraversion and Neuroticism did not influence the responsiveness to other-affirmation, whereas employees with lower scores on Agreeableness showed to benefit more from other-affirmative techniques than individuals with higher scores on Agreeableness do. The findings of this study allow for insights on other- affirmation and can have valuable practical implications for organizations. More research is necessary to obtain an elaborate understanding of the effects and the manner of effective application of other-affirmative strategies within organizations.","['Other-Affirmation, Trust, Job Satisfaction, Organizational Conflict, Personality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism']"
Exploring Co-Occurrence of Shifts in Depression and Anxiety,"Vellinga, Rixt","['Rieble, C.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The presence of both depression and anxiety can have a significant impact on individuals, affecting their well-being and daily functioning. There are many studies on the comorbidity of depression and anxiety, but there is little research on how these disorders change together. This thesis has aimed to investigate the co-occurrence of shifts in depression and anxiety symptom severity and compare standardized assessment measures and individuals' subjective experiences of these shifts. By exploring the co-occurrence of these disorders, this research seeks to contribute to the understanding of their dynamic nature, provide insights for clinical practice in terms of assessment strategies, and improve the selection of appropriate assessment measures. The study utilized an exploratory research design in a non-clinical sample with a sample size of 746 participants, all of whom were students. The measurement tools employed include the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Additionally, perceived shift questions were included to capture participants' subjective experiences of shifts. The key findings revealed a co-occurrence of shifts in depression and anxiety, both when measured with standardized screeners and when assessing the perceived shift in symptom severity of depression and anxiety. Furthermore, outcomes of the standardized screeners and perceived shift questions were compared, suggesting that there was an overlap in outcome between the two different assessment measures, however, this overlap was not very strong. By highlighting the co-occurrence of shifts in depression and anxiety, this thesis contributes to the understanding of these disorders and provides insights for further research. It emphasizes the need to study the common components of both disorders. Additionally, it raises questions about the use of one-item screeners and suggests exploring alternative assessment methods, such as Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data.","['depression, anxiety, perceived shift, co-occurrence']"

University psychoacoustics: The interplay between auditory perception and listening-related fatigue in students with communication difficulties.,"Mironov, Denis","['Tsou, Y.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The present study is part of a larger collective to examine the effects of accessibility on the well-being of young adults with and without communication difficulties. This specific study talks about the connection between sound and human perception which is formally known as psychoacoustics. Individuals with communication difficulties (CD) often have to expend more cognitive resources to process auditory signals (e.g., speech) which can cause listening-related fatigue. This form of fatigue may result in cognitive and physical exhaustion which can affect both social and emotional health. This paper aimed to apply psychoacoustics in the context of university education to investigate whether the level of listening-relate fatigue is higher in CD than non-CD university students and if this effect could be predicted from situational factors. This study used real-time data collected through an ecological momentary assessment which was filled out by 24 Leiden university students (non-CD = 11, CD =13) aging between 18 and 27. Results showed that the CD and non-CD groups did not significantly differ in fatigue level, F (1,20) = 2.167, p = .157, and that the regression model used was not a good fit (p =.143). Only the interaction between sound level and CD was found to be a significant predictor of fatigue (b = .08, t(14) = 3.04 , p = 0.01). Further investigation into this interaction effect revealed that the slope for the relationship between fatigue and sound level was in the positive direction (0.04) for the CD group and in the negative for the non-CD group (-0.04). This indicates that the presence of loud auditory signals likely lead to higher fatigue in the CD demographic but not in the non-CD demographic. Limitations of this study included a small and unrepresentative sample size and lack of data relating to the independent variables. These shortcomings could explain the non-significance of a majority of the findings. Further research should focus on investigating different situational factors (e.g., reverberation and stress) to help explain more variance in fatigue. Continuing to present how environmental and sound features increase or decrease fatigue in students with CD can encourage university to think critically about how they structure their campuses. This paper showcases the importance of soundproofing study environments to prevent prolonged exhaustion in the CD demographic.",

Sporten, specifiek krachttraining, is effectief gebleken in het verbeteren van het mentale welzijn, waaronder het gevoel van eigenwaarde. Eerder onderzoek impliceert dat zelfeffectiviteit bijdraagt aan het gevoel van eigenwaarde. Deze studie onderzoekt of zelfeffectiviteit een mediator is in de relatie tussen krachttraining en eigenwaarde onder jongvolwassenen. Methoden In dit onderzoek werd gebruik gemaakt van een in Qualtrics samengestelde enquête, waarvan de Muscle Strengthening Exercise Questionnaire Short Form, General Self-Efficacy Scale en Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale gebruikt werden. Via flyers, posters en online berichten werden 149 respondenten geworven in de leeftijd van 18-30 jaar. Uiteindelijk werden de antwoorden van 55 respondenten gebruikt in de analyses. Resultaten Er werd geen significante relatie gevonden tussen de intensiteit van krachttraining en het gevoel van eigenwaarde.

The Egg hosted many events like grassroots movements, dance raves, and cultural gatherings within months of protests against Lebanon’s degrading economic and political circumstances. The thesis argues that localized, sensorial notions of the past are disregarded in general historicist and anthropological accounts of the Global North. Framing the history of the Egg as a minor literature, as proposed by Deleuze and Guattari (1983), the thesis aims to highlight the agency of Lebanese people in co-constructing experiential narratives as powerful alternatives to hegemonic historical narratives in postcolonial context. Borrowing Naeff’s (2018) argument, which posits that time is necessarily related to space(s), I examines people’s experiences of time-space (i.e., chronotopes) with regard to the Egg. I draws on three interventions that I did with local artists to illustrate the potential of chronotopes: (1) a spacelicitation, or walking interview in and around the Egg together with a local photographer; (2) a performance inside the Egg with an opera singer; (3) a sound interpretation of the Egg with a music producer. This thesis is one of the first to combine a collaborative and multimodal ethnographic approach to study chronotopes. In line with Blommaert’s (2015) definition of polyphony, I argue that the study of multiple chronotopes of the Egg can provide a polyphonic historical account that is an alternative to traditional historicist narratives, because it gives way to the multiple sensibilities and voices that history contains of.","['17 October Revolution in Lebanon, Historicity, Minor Literature, Time-Space, Chronotopes, Polyphony, Collaborative Ethnography, Multimodal Ethnography.']"

Previous studies have shown that there is often a lack of consensus among youth professionals when making a placement decision (Lindsey, 2004; De Haan et al., 2019). Research showed that personal and work-related characteristics, such as years of work experience and educational background play an important role (Van der Asdonk et al., 2019; De Haan et al., 2019). Knowing that large numbers of families in the Netherlands have dealings with youth care, and wanting to give them proper protection, it is important to gain full knowledge about the way characteristics of youth professionals influence decision-making processes and possible interrelated aspects (Graham et al., 2015). In this study, this has been investigated regarding the decision to lead, or not lead, families to a mandatory youth protection framework. Measured are specifically the variables work experience, level of education, attitude towards forced help, perceived work stress and perceived support in the workplace. Current research did not show any significant relationships between these variables and the decision to lead families to involuntary youth care. This lack of significant correlations may be ascribed to, among other things, a low variance in the sample and a less than expected scale of the sample. Based on the current research, it cannot be concluded that individual characteristics of youth professionals play a role in decision-making processes, but it cannot be said that these connections do not exist either. Follow-up research must further clarify the exact nature of these possible relations. Discussed implications may improve future research-design.","['Jeugdprofessionals, Besluitvormingsprocessen, achtergrondkenmerken, de Jeugdbeschermingstafel,']"

The Role of Parenting in the Development of Children's Effortful Control: A Discussion of possible moderation effect of Parental Stress and Parental Psychopathology: PARENTING AND CHILDREN’S EFFOTFUL CONTROL,"Husaini, Hala AL","['Meulen, M. van der']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Young children’s effortful control predicts an extensive variety of developmental outcomes. Therefore, it is important to investigate possible parenting factors that influence the development of children’s ability to control their behavior. The effect of parental sensitivity on children’s effortful control was studied concurrently and longitudinally. Moreover, the study investigated other crucial parental factors namely parental stress and parental psychopathology as possible moderators. This study is a part of the longitudinal Leiden Consortium on Individual Development (L-CID), of which wave one and wave three were selected. Mean age of children of wave one was (M = 3.78, N = 238 families) and wave three was (M = 5.81, N = 200 families). Children’s effortful control was measured using a shortened version of the Children Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ). Parental sensitivity was measured via observations of parent-child interaction in the Etch-A-Sketch task. The regression analysis showed that parental sensitivity is an essential predictor to children's effortful control concurrently and longitudinally. The moderation analysis did not show an evidence for a moderation effect of neither parental stress nor parental psychopathology. The study contributed to the existing literature by adding a moderation approach of analyzing factors contributing to the development of children’s effortful control. The results highlighted the importance of investing in promoting parental sensitivity in programs designed to promote healthier parent-child relationships in order to increase children’s effortful control.","['parenting, early childhood, effortful control, parental sensitivity, parental stress, parental Psychopathology, moderation, children’s development, longitudinal study']"

Based on the stress and coping theory, associations between parental CMC, SES, adolescent coping, stress and internalizing behavior including moderation effects were examined. No significant associations or regressions were found; thus, moderations were not conducted. Adolescent coping skills were significantly better in households with dual parental CMC. SES was lower than the average national income in our sample. Girls experienced significantly higher levels of internalizing behavior and stress than boys, and younger children had significantly lower stress levels than older children. Future studies should examine adolescent coping skills, SES, as well as the elevated levels of psychological distress in girls and older children.

The role of Physical activity in Behavioural inhibition and Sleep difficulties: Age and gender differences,"Merbis, Rosa","['Vreeke, L.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Aim: Sleep difficulties are a common problem among young children. Reduction in sleep affects cognitive processes and therefore has consequences for development and functioning in daily life. Behavioural inhibition, which includes avoidant behaviour, is expected to be an important predictor for Sleep difficulties. Previous research stated that Physical activity on the other hand could reduce Sleep difficulties. Therefore this study investigated the role of Physical activity in the relation between Behavioural inhibition and Sleep difficulties in boys and girls aged five and ten. Methods: This study used data from the GGD Nederland. Questionnaires from the “Jij en Je Gezondheid vragenlijst” are used to measure the three variables. Parents of a total of 12118 five year olds and 11256 ten year olds completed the questionnaire. The data was analysed by a mediation analyses and a moderated mediation analysis in PROCESS SPSS. Results: The results show significant correlations between all the three mutual variables. This means that there is some dependence between the variables. In addition, significant relations were found, however the effect sizes of the mediation model were too small (d=.11) to be of actual meaning. Conclusion: The current study does not find enough evidence for Physical activity to be a mediator in the relationship between Behavioural inhibition and Sleep difficulties. Future research should use different psychometric measures and focus more on exercising rather than Physical activity in general.","['Physical activity', 'Behavioural inhibition', 'Sleep difficulties', 'Sleep problems', 'exercise', 'anxiety', 'young children', 'avoidant behaviour', 'mediation', 'moderated mediation']"

Om antwoord te krijgen op deze vraag is er een literatuuronderzoek gedaan en zijn er 5 interviews afgenomen met onderwijsprofessionals, allen werkzaam op school x. Deze onderwijsprofessionals zijn allemaal betrokken bij de onderbouw van de basisschool. De uitkomsten van de interviews zijn gecodeerd en daaruit zijn de volgende uitkomsten gekomen. De onderwijsprofessionals gaven in de interviews aan dat zij over het algemeen positief zijn over het inzetten van spelend leren in groep 3. Een positieve houding van leerkrachten tegenover spelend leren is belangrijk bij het inzetten van spelend leren. De onderwijsprofessionals gaven ook aan dat zij spelend leren in groep 3 begeleiden op verschillende manieren, zij gaven aan te observeren, mee te spelen en impulsen te geven. Deze drie rollen zijn ook terug te vinden in de literatuur. Als voordeel van spelend leren gaven de onderwijsprofessionals aan goed leerlingen op hun eigen niveau te begeleiden. In de literatuur wordt vermeld dat om te differentiëren in de klas het belangrijk is om een stap terug te nemen als leerkracht en te observeren, dit wordt tijdens spelend leren vaak gedaan. Toch geven de onderwijsprofessionals ook aan dat het soms lastig is om in te schatten wanneer er impulsen gegeven moeten worden en wanneer de impulsen het spel juist onderbreken. Dit wordt ook bevestigd in de literatuur.","['Spelend leren, opbrengsten, groep 3, vrij spel, begeleiding']"

De volgende onderzoeksvraag werd in overleg met Pedologisch Instituut De Brug te Leiden opgesteld: waar kan rekening mee gehouden worden met het kiezen van een nieuwe begrijpend lezen methode, passend bij de doelgroep SO-cluster 4? Er werden drie wetenschappelijke overzichtsartikelen geraadpleegd voor beschikbare wetenschappelijke kennis over begrijpend leesonderwijs. Op basis van deze literatuur werden er zes elementen van effectief begrijpend leesonderwijs geselecteerd: woordenschat & achtergrondkennis, leesstrategieën, leesmotivatie, technisch lezen, rijke taalomgeving en interactie. Het praktijkonderzoek was een vragenlijst met stellingen, gebaseerd op deze zes elementen. De vragenlijst werd na een pilot verspreid onder leerkrachten van PI De Brug (N=11). Per element werd de gemiddelde score van de respondenten berekend. Uit de vragenlijst bleek dat leerkrachten woordenschat & achtergrondkennis en leesmotivatie het belangrijkst vonden. Technisch lezen werd als minst belangrijk gezien, en het element interactie blijkt redelijk moeilijk toepasbaar voor de doelgroep. Daarnaast hadden leerkrachten wisselende visies op het element leesstrategieën. Alle zes elementen zijn belangrijk voor het bieden van effectief begrijpend leesonderwijs op een cluster 4 school, maar de praktische toepasbaarheid lijkt per element te verschillen. Omdat er slechts 11 respondenten waren, kunnen de resultaten niet zonder meer gegeneraliseerd worden naar iedere SO-school. Toekomstig onderzoek naar de verhouding tussen de specifieke behoeften van cluster 4 leerlingen en de praktische toepassing van de zes elementen zou een relevant vervolg zijn van deze studie.","['speciaal onderwijs', 'cluster 4', 'begrijpend lezen']"
Ouderbetrokkenheid bij het Lezen Thuis: Een Analyse van de Ouderbetrokkenheid bij het Lezen Thuis op een Nederlandse Basisschool en Adviezen hoe dit Verhoogd kan worden.,"Pater, Evelien Pater","['Chung, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Door de dalende leesvaardigheid en leesmotivatie in Nederland en op basisschool X, heeft laatstgenoemde ingezet op het verhogen van de leesmotivatie van haar leerlingen. Naast leerkrachten hebben vooral ouders een grote invloed op de leesmotivatie van kinderen. Met deze reden wilde basisschool X inzicht krijgen in de ouderbetrokkenheid bij het lezen thuis van ouders van haar leerlingen. In dit onderzoek is aan de hand van een vragenlijst deze ouderbetrokkenheid in beeld gebracht, waarna adviezen zijn geformuleerd om de ouderbetrokkenheid bij het lezen thuis te kunnen verhogen. Verder is gekeken naar verschillen in ouderbetrokkenheid tussen vaders en moeders en tussen ouders van de onderbouw en bovenbouw. De ouderbetrokkenheid werd gemeten op een vijfpuntsschaal, waar een score van 1 samenhing met geen ouderbetrokkenheid bij het lezen en een score van 5 met een hoge mate van ouderbetrokkenheid. Op basisschool X scoorden de ouders bovengemiddeld: een 3.63 gemiddeld (N=60). Er werd geen verschil in ouderbetrokkenheid gevonden tussen vaders en moeders en tussen ouders van de onder- en bovenbouw. In vergelijking met andere activiteiten rondom het lezen, werd er minder over de inhoud van boeken gepraat en werd de bibliotheek minder bezocht door ouders van deze basisschool. Basisschool X zou deze activiteiten bij haar ouders kunnen stimuleren om op deze manier de ouderbetrokkenheid en de leesmotivatie te kunnen verhogen. School en ouders zullen een team moeten vormen om de leesmotivatie en daarmee leesvaardigheid van de Nederlandse leerlingen te vergoten.","['ouderbetrokkenheid bij lezen, leesmotivatie, leesactiviteiten, literaire middelen, leesattitude']"
Samenhang tussen onderwijsfactoren en het welbevinden van leerlingen in het basisonderwijs,"Verkade, Amber",['Hinke Endedijk'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Welbevinden is een multidimensionaal construct met de domeinen psychologisch, sociaal, cognitief en fysiek welbevinden. Het welbevinden wordt gezien als een voorwaarde voor leerlingen uit het primair basisonderwijs om tot leren te komen. De afgelopen jaren is een dalende trend te zien van het welbevinden van deze leerlingen. Om de samenhang tussen de perceptie van onderwijsfactoren en het welbevinden te toetsen hebben 38 leerlingen uit leerjaargroepen vier, vijf en zes van het primair basisonderwijs twee vragenlijsten ingevuld: een vragenlijst met betrekking tot het welbevinden en een zelfontworpen vragenlijst betreffende de perceptie van aandacht voor onderwijsfactoren. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat de aandacht voor de onderwijsfactoren niet significant samenhangt met de domeinen van welbevinden. Wel is er voor het domein psychologisch welbevinden een positieve samenhang gevonden met sociale interacties, maar een negatieve samenhang met autonomie. Voor het domein sociaal welbevinden is ook een positieve samenhang gevonden met sociale interacties. Met betrekking tot het cognitief welbevinden is voor vindingrijkheid een positieve samenhang gevonden, maar geen samenhang met zelfbewustzijn en wereldburgerschap. Ten slotte is een negatieve samenhang gevonden voor het domein fysiek welbevinden en sociale interacties. Om het inzicht in de mogelijk welbevinden-bevorderende onderwijsfactoren verder te duiden, zou de behoefte aan aandacht voor autonomie kunnen worden getoetst en stellingen in de zelfontworpen vragenlijst kunnen worden opgenomen met betrekking tot het fysiek welzijn. Ook zou de aandacht voor wereldburgerschap kunnen worden geconcretiseerd door middel van focusgroepen. Daarnaast zouden de onderwijsfactoren zelfbewustzijn en vindingrijkheid kunnen worden opgedeeld in subfactoren en deze worden gerelateerd aan het welbevinden.","['welbevinden', 'onderwijsfactoren', 'basisonderwijs', 'middenbouw', 'autonomie', 'sociale interacties', 'zelfbewustzijn', 'vindingrijkheid', 'wereldburgerschap']"

Hierdoor kunnen er wellicht overeenkomsten en/of verschillen gerapporteerd worden tussen de voor- en nadelen uit de literatuur van spelend leren en de (h)erkenning door de onderwijsprofessionals hiervan. Daarom zijn er vijf onderwijsprofessionals uit de onderbouw van een basisschool geïnterviewd om erachter te komen welke thema’s van belang zijn bij het wel of niet inzetten van spelend leren in groep 3. De onderwijsprofessionals gaven gedurende de interviews aan dat het inzetten van spelend leren meerdere academische voordelen heeft. Deze manier van leren heeft een positieve invloed op het bevorderen van de vroege rekenvaardigheden en op de ontwikkeling van de woordenschat. Echter werd het aanleren van complexe vaardigheden als een nadeel ervaren door de onderwijsprofessionals. De onderwijsprofessionals gaven aan dat complexe vaardigheden effectief aangeleerd kunnen worden wanneer directe instructie in combinatie met spelend leren wordt ingezet. Daarnaast werden ook op sociaal-emotioneel gebied meerdere voordelen van spelend leren gerapporteerd: het probleemoplossend vermogen en de ontwikkeling van sociale vaardigheden worden gestimuleerd. Zowel de academische als de sociaal-emotionele voor- en nadelen die ervaren worden door de onderwijsprofessionals tonen in zekere mate overlap met thema’s uit de literatuur als het gaat om het wel of juist niet inzetten van spelend leren. Daarnaast was het opvallend dat bij het beschrijven van de voor- en nadelen uit zowel de literatuur als de praktijk de voordelen van spelend leren zowel academisch als sociaal-emotioneel vaker en uitgebreider werden belicht dan de nadelen ervan. Al met al kan er gesteld worden dat de vele voordelen van spelend leren vanuit de literatuur ook ervaren worden in de praktijk, wat duidt op een positieve houding van de onderwijsprofessionals tegenover het inzetten van spelend leren.","['Spelend leren, groep 3, onderwijsprofessionals, voordelen, nadelen,']"

In dit onderzoek staat de relatie tussen de onderwijsconcepten sociale interacties, vindingrijkheid, zelfbewustzijn, autonomie en wereldburgerschap en het welbevinden van leerlingen in het primair onderwijs centraal, om te onderzoeken in hoeverre de mate van aandacht die de leerlingen ervaren voor deze onderwijsconcepten kan bijdragen aan hun welbevinden. De studie is uitgevoerd op een dorpsschool in de randstad waar het welbevinden van leerlingen centraal staat. In totaal hebben 38 leerlingen uit de groepen 4, 5 en 6 meegedaan, waarvan 15 jongens en 23 meisjes, met een gemiddelde leeftijd van 8 jaar. In deze studie is de samenhang tussen de aandacht die er volgens leerlingen is voor de onderwijsconcepten en de mate van welbevinden van leerlingen getoetst. Elk van de onderwijsconcepten lijkt op positieve wijze zwak tot matig gerelateerd te zijn aan ten minste één van de domeinen van welbevinden, met uitzondering van de concepten autonomie en wereldburgerschap die ook negatieve relaties kennen met de domeinen van welbevinden. Een tweede uitzondering hierop zijn de negatieve relaties tussen de onderwijsconcepten en het fysiek welbevinden. In de discussie worden suggesties gedaan voor vervolgonderzoek en de onderwijspraktijk, zoals het meten van de behoefte aan autonomie en autonomieondersteuning om inzicht te krijgen in de manier hoe deze bijdragen aan het welbevinden.",

Dit onderzoek is gericht op de huidige kennis van leerkrachten over differentiatie, de houding hier tegenover en de toepassing hiervan. De kennis, houding en toepassing van differentiatie werden onderzocht door middel van een vragenlijst, die gebaseerd is op effectieve vormen van differentiatie. Dit werd ingeschat door leerkrachten aan de hand van een 5-punts Likertschaal. De vragenlijst werd volledig ingevuld door achttien Nederlandse leerkrachten van de groepen 3 t/m 8 op drie basisscholen. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat er op houding hoger gescoord is dan op kennis en toepassing van differentiatie. Kennis en houding zijn positief verbonden met de toepassing van differentiatie, maar alleen kennis kan voorspellen in hoeverre differentiatie wordt toegepast. Verder hebben leerkrachten meer kennis omtrent convergent differentiëren dan divergent differentiëren. Preteaching wordt het minst toegepast, terwijl de kennis en houding omtrent preteaching significant hoger zijn. Ten slotte is gebleken dat meer rekenkennis verbonden is met meer kennis van differentiatie. Concluderend kan gesteld worden dat leerkrachten differentiatie belangrijk vinden, maar het in de praktijk minder toepassen en over minder specifieke kennis beschikken. De implicaties zijn gericht op het belang van het stimuleren van de specifieke kennis, de kennis over divergente differentiatie en het inzetten van preteaching.

This paper examines how the traits of Machiavellianism, psychopathy and narcissism affect aggression in an experimental setting. Based on the previous literature, we hypothesized that Machiavellianism and psychopathy were positively correlated with aggression, while narcissism would be unrelated. We used the Attacker-Defender Conflict (AD-C), an economic contest well suited to study aggression. The incentivized AD-C was implemented in an online environment where attackers and defenders, who were matched afterwards, competed for resources. Attackers decided how much they would invest in order to beat the defender and gain money at their expense. If the defender successfully defended by investing more or an equal amount as the attacker, both parties kept their non-invested resources. Out of 301 participants, the attacker conflict investment of 132 attackers was used to measure aggression. Participants also completed the Short Dark Triad, a self-report questionnaire that evaluates Dark Triad traits. Our analysis showed a positive correlation between Machiavellianism and aggression, but only when the other two traits were held constant. Contrary to our assumption, psychopathy was negatively related to aggression. Finally, narcissism was not significantly correlated with aggression. These findings imply that, while the understanding of Machiavellianism and narcissism based on self-report measures of aggression are supported in our study, psychopathy’s connection to aggression may have either been misunderstood before or unknown factors played a significant role by confounding the results. Implications, limitations, and recommendations for future research are discussed.","['Dark Triad', 'Aggression', 'Attacker-Defender Contest', 'Machiavellianism', 'Psychopathy', 'Narcissism']"
De rol van de leerkracht bij het stimuleren van leesmotivatie in het basisonderwijs,"Dijk, Valentijn van","['Koornneef, A.W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De Nederlandse leesresultaten op de PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) dalen. Met de recentste resultaten is Nederland onder het Europees gemiddelde gezakt (Gubbels et al., 2019). Hiernaast blijkt ook de leesmotivatie gedaald (DUO Onderwijsonderzoek, 2017). Mogelijk beïnvloeden deze tendensen elkaar, omdat leesmotivatie invloed heeft op leesresultaten (Schiefele et al., 2012). In deze studie is onderzocht in hoeverre de houding en het gedrag van leerkrachten bij het stimuleren van leesmotivatie in overeenstemming is met de literatuur over leesmotivatie. Met 4 focusgroepen (21 participanten) kan geconcludeerd worden dat de houding en het gedrag van leerkrachten slechts deels in overeenstemming is met de literatuur. Bij (lees)motivatie wordt onderscheid gemaakt tussen intrinsieke en extrinsieke leesmotivatie (Schiefele et al., 2012). Leerkrachten zijn op de hoogte van het belang van leesmotivatie, maar bezitten weinig kennis van de theoretische achtergrond. Door leerlingen te laten voldoen aan een gevoel van competentie, verbondenheid en autonomie (de drie basisbehoeften voor intrinsieke motivatie (Ryan & Deci, 2000)) kan leesmotivatie gestimuleerd worden. Ondanks het gebrek aan theoretische kennis blijken leerkrachten activiteiten aanbieden die gelinkt kunnen worden aan de basisbehoeften, hoewel dit dus mogelijk op toevalligheid berust. Hiernaast zijn er ook aspecten in de houding en georganiseerde activiteiten van leerkrachten zonder weerslag in de literatuur. De houding en het gedrag van leerkrachten is dus niet volledig in overeenstemming met de literatuur, zo valt er voor leerkrachten per basisbehoefte winst te behalen in het stimuleren van leesmotivatie in leeslessen en daarbuiten. Concrete en generaliseerbare aanbevelingen voor de gehele onderwijspraktijk vragen om vervolgonderzoek.","['Leesmotivatie', 'leesonderwijs', 'invloed leerkracht', 'houding leerkracht', 'gedrag leerkracht']"
Self-efficacy in Burgerschapsonderwijs: Het verband tussen het Sociaal Welbevinden van Basisschoolleerkrachten en de mate van Self-efficacy die zij ervaren op het gebied van Burgerschapsonderwijs.,"Meijs, Tessa van der","['Krijnen, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Naar aanleiding van de vernieuwde burgerschapswet kwam bij schoolbesturen en -leiders de vraag op hoe de invulling van deze wet geïmplementeerd moest worden in de scholen en klassen. De invulling van het burgerschapsonderwijs is voor een groot deel afhankelijk van de persoonlijke overtuigingen en keuzes van de leerkracht. Self-efficacy blijkt een belangrijke factor in de keuzes die een leerkracht maakt in het vormgeven van diens onderwijs. Het sociaal welbevinden van leerkrachten is bevorderlijk voor de mate van self-efficacy. Het huidige onderzoek bestudeert daarom het verband tussen het sociaal welbevinden dat leerkrachten binnen hun eigen schoolteam ervaren en de mate van self-efficacy die zij hebben op het gebied van burgerschapsonderwijs. Een positief verband tussen deze twee factoren zou schoolbesturen en -leiders handvatten kunnen bieden voor het vormgeven van effectief burgerschapsonderwijs. Er zijn vragenlijsten afgenomen bij 59 basisschoolleerkrachten van eenzelfde onderwijsorganisatie. Er werd geen significant verband gevonden. Een belangrijke verklaring hiervoor is het gegeven dat factoren als kennis, motivatie en ervaring ook bepalend zijn in de totstandkoming van de mate van self-efficacy van een leerkracht. Een aanbeveling voor vervolgonderzoek naar burgerschapsonderwijs zou dan ook zijn om dit onderwerp breder te onderzoeken en er op die manier achter te komen welke andere factoren belangrijk zijn voor het effectief vormgeven van burgerschapsonderwijs.",

Op bepaalde domeinen van welbevinden werden negatieve verbanden gevonden bij wereldburgerschap en sociale interacties, deze waren echter zwakke verbanden. Op bepaalde domeinen van welbevinden werden positieve verbanden werden gevonden op de onderwijsfactoren sociale interacties, zelfbewustzijn en vindingrijkheid. Hoewel het construct welbevinden veelvuldig is onderzocht, biedt dit onderzoek meer inzicht in de onderwijsfactoren die het welbevinden van leerlingen mogelijk ondersteunen.",['Welbevinden']

De rol van leerkrachthouding en leerkrachtgedrag bij het stimuleren van leesmotivatie bij basisschoolleerlingen,"Rivecourt, Maaike de","['Koorneef, A.W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek richt zich op de vraag “Wat doen leerkrachten in de klassenpraktijk om de leesmotivatie van leerlingen te bevorderen en hoe heeft de eigen houding van de leerkracht ten opzichte van lezen invloed op het bevorderen van leesmotivatie bij leerlingen?” De studie omvatte 21 participanten. Kwalitatieve gegevens werden verzameld via vier focusgroepen. Uit de focusgroepen blijkt dat leerkrachten een verscheidenheid aan werkvormen gebruiken om leesmotivatie bij leerlingen te bevorderen. In dit onderzoek zijn deze werkvormen naast de Zelfdeterminatietheorie van Ryan en Deci (2000) gelegd. Uit de resultaten bleek dat de basisbehoeften autonomie en competentie vaker genoemd worden dan de basisbehoefte relatie. De mate waarin deze drie basisbehoeften worden vervuld, bepaalt de intrinsieke motivatie van een individu. Daarnaast werd in de focusgroepen gesproken over de eigen houding van de leerkracht ten opzichte van lezen. De meeste participanten in dit onderzoek hebben een positieve attitude ten opzichte van lezen. Vier participanten hebben een negatieve houding ten opzichte van lezen. De meeste participanten stimuleren leerlingen actief om te lezen. Vier participanten stimuleren terughoudend om te lezen. Uit de literatuur blijkt dat een positieve correlatie bestaat tussen leesgedrag van leerkrachten en leesprestaties van leerlingen (McKool & Gespass, 2009). Alles beschouwend is het van belang de basisbehoefte relatie en de houding van de leerkracht ten aanzien van lezen in acht te nemen bij het bevorderen van de leesmotivatie van leerlingen.","['leesmotivatie', 'leerkrachthouding', 'leerkrachtgedrag', 'basisschool']"
Spelend leren: Onderzoek naar de opbrengsten van spelend leren in groep 3 en de factoren die dit beïnvloeden.,"Reisen, Annika van","['Jolles, D.D.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze scriptie onderzoekt de opbrengsten van spelend leren in groep 3 op academisch en sociaal-emotioneel gebied en de factoren die deze opbrengsten kunnen beïnvloeden. In de literatuur wordt erg veel beschreven over de opbrengsten van spelend leren bij kleuters. Echter is er weinig bekend over deze opbrengsten in groep 3. Daarnaast zijn er weinig artikelen die geraadpleegd kunnen worden rondom de ervaringen met deze opbrengsten van onderwijsprofessionals in de praktijk. De onderzoeksvraag die is onderzocht luidt: Welke opbrengsten op academisch en sociaal-emotioneel gebied kunnen volgens onderwijsprofessionals worden bereikt door het inzetten van spelend leren in groep 3 en welke factoren zijn hierop van invloed? Er is een empirisch onderzoek uitgevoerd door middel van het afnemen van interviews bij vijf onderwijsprofessionals die betrokken zijn bij de onderbouw van het basisonderwijs. Er is geconcludeerd dat spelend leren volgens onderwijsprofessionals op academisch gebied kan bijdragen aan de ontwikkeling van rekenvaardigheden en de woordenschat. Spelend leren is echter minder geschikt om nieuwe, complexe vaardigheden mee aan te leren. Dit kan alleen in combinatie met directe instructie. Op sociaal-emotioneel gebied kan spelend leren volgens onderwijsprofessionals bijdragen aan de ontwikkeling van sociale vaardigheden, probleemoplossend vermogen, zelfvertrouwen en motivatie. Factoren die volgens onderwijsprofessionals van invloed zijn op de opbrengsten die spelend leren met zich meebrengt, zijn onder andere de vormgeving van de begeleiding door de leerkracht tijdens het spel en de mogelijkheid voor de leerkracht om het spel te faciliteren. Om een beter passende spelomgeving te kunnen creëren is meer tijd en geld nodig. De resultaten van dit onderzoek suggereren dat het belangrijk is om spelend leren te integreren in het onderwijs aan groep 3 en tijd en ruimte te maken voor de leerkrachten om dit spel op een effectieve manier te kunnen organiseren.","['Spelend leren', 'academische opbrengsten', 'sociaal-emotionele opbrengsten', 'groep 3']"

In deze scriptie wordt daarom onderzocht wat leerkrachten van basisschool de Meerpaal kunnen doen om een veiliger klimaat te creëren voor de groepen vier tot en met acht. Om dit te onderzoeken wordt een vragenlijst afgenomen bij de leerkrachten van de Meerpaal. Vanuit theorieën zoals het behaviorisme (Skinner, 1953) en de sociale leertheorie (Bandura, 1999) in combinatie met verschillende wetenschappelijke artikelen zijn vijf schalen opgesteld met stellingvragen. Leerkrachten geven aan in hoeverre ze het eens of oneens zijn met een bepaalde stelling op een zeven punts-Likertschaal, van zeer mee oneens tot zeer mee eens. De vijf schalen zijn PBS, schoolbeleid, klassenmanagement, omgaan met gedrag en oudercontact. Daarnaast worden nog vragen gesteld over de huidige schoolregels en wordt de vragenlijst afgesloten met drie open vragen. De resultaten uit de vijf schalen benadrukken dat de school zich moet richten op het verbeteren van het schoolbeleid en het sociaal-emotionele welzijn van de kinderen, aangezien op deze schaal de laagste gemiddelde score is behaald. De school zal (preventief) moeten werken aan het sociaal-emotioneel welzijn van de kinderen. Ook wordt aangeraden een eenduidig plan op te stellen, waar het hele team achter staat. Daarnaast zal er meer aandacht moeten worden besteed aan het verduidelijken van de schoolregel; ik ben respectvol naar een ander’. Tot slot zal de school moeten werken aan zowel het positieve klassenklimaat als het positieve schoolklimaat, door een schoolbreed beloningssysteem te implementeren.","['De Meerpaal, veilig schoolklimaat, positive behavior support, vragenlijst, behaviorsme']"

Not much is known about how CFC is formed or how it can be changed. Previous studies show that CFC is negatively related to self-defeating behavior and positively related to goal achievement. The goal of the present study was to reestablish these relations with a more generalized definition of self-defeating behavior and goal achievement in different domains. Apart from this, the present study had the goal of determining whether CFC could be changed through a VR- or smartphone application over the course of three weeks. 193 first year students from Leiden University (92,7% female) participated in the study. The participants were divided among three conditions: a VR-condition, a smartphone app-condition and a control condition. At the start of the study, the participants were asked to complete a questionnaire measuring CFC and self-defeating behavior. In addition, all participants set goals for themselves to complete. The degree to which they had achieved these goals was measured after three weeks, along with a second measurement of CFC. It was found through a regression analysis that CFC showed a significant correlation with self-defeating behavior, meaning CFC predicted this behavior. A regression analysis between CFC and goal achievement showed no significant correlation, meaning that CFC did not predict goal achievement. Finally, a repeated measures ANOVA indicated that there was no significant improvement of CFC after three weeks of using the intervention. Although no significant difference was found, perhaps an intervention that is used for a longer time period or a domain specific intervention could yield more successful results in improving CFC. More research is needed in defining the underlying constructs of self-defeating behavior and goal achievement, as well as evaluating possible ways to stimulate awareness of future consequences.","['CFC', 'self-defeating behavior', 'goal achievement', 'intervention', 'virtual reality']"

Application of the MELODIC family to assess predictive and discriminant validity of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire,"Goldbohm, Sorcha Maria Royle","['Rooij, M.J. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social science researchers commonly employ univariate models, yet multivariate models offer the advantage of depicting multiple outcomes and the dependencies between these outcomes simultaneously. De Rooij and Groenen (2021) introduced the MELODIC family, a multivariate approach for addressing these multiple binary outcome variables. The assessment focused on diagnoses and the scales of a behavioural screening questionnaire (SDQ) in a Northern Netherlands outpatient population. Predictive validity gauged content-related scale performance in diagnosis prediction. Discriminative validity was confirmed if only the diagnosis-related scale accurately predicted the presence of the diagnosis. AUC values were used for these comparisons. No significant differences emerged among the models. Since we did not find direct differences across the different models. We tried to elucidate the cause of these non-significant differences by post-hoc analyses: scatterplots and Brier scores. The scatterplots of the ordering of probabilities for a univariate multiple logistic regression and a MELODIC model did not offer any more insights. The Brier scores yielded no additional insights either. There was no more evidence for the predictive and discriminative validity when the MELODIC model was used. The benefit of the utilization of a MELODIC model was that it allowed for the inclusion of all predictors and outcome variables at the same time, eliminating the requirement for multiple separate univariate models and thus reducing the likelihood of errors.","['multivariate', 'logistic distance models', 'MELODIC', 'binary', 'multiple outcome variables']"
The volunteer’s dilemma: Framing the choice – Understanding the effects of gains and losses,"Ramler, Daphne",['Erik de Kwaadsteniet'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study examines the Volunteers’ Dilemma (VoD), where one person must bear a cost so that thew hole group can benefit. If no one volunteers, all suffer and will experience the negative effects. This study investigates the influence of gain/loss frames and Social Value Orientation (SVO) on volunteer behaviour. The experiment involved 102 participants (N = 102), randomly assigned to gain or loss frame conditions. Participants completed 48 rounds of decision-making, where every round they chose to volunteer for the group or not. Contrary to expectations, the t-test results showed no significant difference in volunteer behaviour between gain and loss frames. Additionally, a linear regression analysis found no significant relationship between SVO and volunteer behaviour. These non-significant results challenge previous research on framing effects and the impact of SVO on volunteer behaviour. Despite the absence of significant effects, this study provides valuable insights into the complexity of volunteer decision-making. It highlights the need to consider multiple factors in understanding the dynamics of the VoD. Future research could benefit from larger and more diverse samples to examine mediating or moderating factors that may influence volunteer behaviour.",

I argue that the level of inclusiveness of civilians in rebel governance depends on the group’s reliance on lootable natural resources. Rebel groups that rely on these resources are less dependent on the civilian population for support and therefore less likely to include them in the governing process. To test this hypothesis, I combine newly available quantitative data on rebel governance with existing data on the presence of natural resources. In doing so, I attempt to bridge the fields of natural resources and rebel governance. The analysis finds no support for the hypothesis, lootable natural resources show to have a positive influence on the level of rebel governance inclusiveness. The findings have implications for both academics and policy makers.","['rebel governance', 'inclusive rebel governance', 'natural resources', 'lootable natural resources', 'civil conflict', 'rebel groups']"
De relatie tussen prenatale gehechtheid en risicostatus van de moeder en agressie bij een kind van 20 maanden,"Geest, Isabella van der","['Huijbregts, S.C.J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Background: previous research showed the relationship between the risk status of the mother and child aggression. Attachment has also been related to child aggression and this includes prenatal attachment. If prenatal attachment moderates the relationship between risk status and child aggression, an intervention could be implemented to improve the prenatal attachment in order to prevent or reduce aggression by the child. Research question: Does prenatal attachment moderate the relationship between the risk status of the mother and the aggression of 20-month-old children? Methods: Maternal risk status and prenatal attachment were assessed during pregnancy and aggression was assessed when the children were 20 months old. The mothers were divided into two groups, one group consisted of high risk mothers and the other of low risk mothers (based on criteria by the World Health Organization and a weighted count of the number of risk factors). The mothers completed the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale (MAAS) during the first assessment (pregnancy) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) during the 4th assessment when the children were approximately 20 months old. Analyses of variance were used to examine whether prenatal attachment moderated the association between risk status and child aggression. Results: The risk status of the mother predicted the aggression of the 20-month-old child. There also was a significant relationship between prenatal attachment and risk status. There were no significant relations between prenatal attachment and aggression. Lastly, prenatal attachment did not moderate the relation between the risk status of the mother and the aggression of the child. Conclusion: The results of this study confirm the relation between the risk status of the mother and the aggression of the 20-month-old child. An intervention could be introduced when a mother is categorized as high risk. Further research is needed to see which factors could moderate the relationship between the risk status of the mother and the aggression of the child.",

"De samenhang van stressful life events tussen angst en regulatieproblemen bij kinderen met het Klinefeltersyndroom (47, XXY)","Thakoersingh, Warsha","['Rijn, S. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Children with Klinefelter may face difficulties in their later life when it comes to social emotional development and behavior problems (Bruining et al., 2009). This could lead to behavior- and emotion regulation problems including anxiety. During a stressful life event it is crucial to be able to control/use cognitive emotion regulation strategies (Thompson, 1994). If this fails, it can lead to behavior- or social development problems. Although separate results from previous studies suggest a link between anxiety, regulation problems and stressful life events, this possible coherence has not been studied yet for Klinefelter children. Method: To investigate this, 95 children in the age of 1-7 years (of which 51 children with Klinefelter) and their parents participated in a series of questionnaires (Child Behavior Checklist, Children’s Behavior-/Early Childhood Behavior-/VMG Life Events Questionnaire). Results: Children with Klinefelter were found to be more anxious and showed a less expressive internal regulation state compared to the control group, according to their parents. According to the CBQ/ECBQ Reactivity/Soothability subscale results, children with Klinefelter showed less expressive (blunted) emotions when they were in pain, upset or experienced an exciting activity/event. In addition, stressful life events turned out to be a predictor for anxious depressed behavior in children with Klinefelter. There was also no interaction found for the degree of stressful life events and anxious/depressed or reactivity/soothability behavior within the Klinefelter- or control group. Conclusion: Children with Klinefelter experience more anxiety/depressed behavior and less expressive internal regulation state than children without Klinefelter. An association between stressful life events and anxiety/depressed behavior is found within children with Klinefelter, but there is no evidence found for a coherence between stressful life events and regulation problems. Furthermore, no interaction was found between the degree of stressful life events and anxious/depressed or reactivity/soothability behavior within the Klinefelter- or control group.","['Klinefelter', 'XXY', 'samenhang', 'stressful live events', 'angst', 'regulatieproblemen']"

Previous research indicates that within the core symptoms of autism there are differences in the behavioral expressions in boys and girls with autism characteristics. Yet not enough is known about the sex differences within autism and the associated behavioral expressions that influence quality of life (QoL). Using this research, it is investigated to what extent the degree of autism characteristics is related to social cognition and QoL in boys and girls. Method: The study has a cross-sectional research design. The research group consist 22 boys and 20 girls in primary and secondary school age. The SRS was used to measure the degree of autism characteristics. QoL was questioned with the Cantril-ladder self-assessment questionnaire and social cognition was measured with the VR perspective taking test. Results: The results confirm that neither social cognition nor degree of autism characteristics are predictors of QoL. In addition, gender does not influence the relationship between social cognition and the degree of autism characteristics. This is also the case with the relationship between the QoL and the degree of autism characteristics. Conclusion: The data suggest some interesting findings about the sex differences in boys and girls with autism and the view of QoL in this group children. Both boys and girls experience limitations within social cognition. The way in which these restrictions are deal with differs. To meet the expectations of others, people with autism use different techniques to hide their autism. This may have a negative impact on QoL. In future research it is necessary to have more knowledge about the sex differences in people with autism characteristics.","['autisme', 'sociale cognitie', 'kwaliteit van leven']"

Sociaal-emotionele competenties van adolescente jongens met een antisociale gedragsstoornis,"Nijveen, Suzanne","['Aghajani, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"The current study focused on the influence of social cognition on cognitive and affective empathy and whether the LPE-label and socioeconomic status fulfilled moderating roles in the relationships between these socioemotional aspects for adolescent boys with conduct disorder (CD). The aim of the study was to focus on these relations within the CD-group itself, since most research compared CD-youth with healthy controls, thereby omitting the heterogeneity of CD. Moreover, the relationship between social cognition and empathy, both socioemotional aspects, within the CD-group itself had not been examined yet. The different socioemotional aspects were measured using questionnaires, such as the Basic Empathy Scale and the Social Responsiveness Scale. These were completed by 49 adolescent boys, aged from fifteen to nineteen years, with a severe form of CD. Two double moderation regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship between social cognition and the dependent factors cognitive and affective empathy. For cognitive empathy there were no significant relationships found. For affective empathy significant relationships were present. First of all, there was a negative effect of social cognition on affective empathy, higher levels of social cognition were linked to lower levels affective empathy. This could be explained by the fact that CD-youth with higher social cognition capacities know how to take advantage of others, therefore being more manipulative without having to empathize with them. Secondly, as expected, there was a positive effect of LPE: the CD/LPE+ group scored significantly lower on affective empathy than the CD/LPE- group. Additionally, there were no significant moderations of LPE-label and socioeconomic status found for both cognitive and affective empathy. To conclude, having better social cognition skills as well as CD/LPE+ were related to lower levels of affective empathy, not cognitive empathy, in adolescent boys with severe CD.","['Sociaal-emotionele competenties', 'empathie', 'sociale cognitie', 'antisociale gedragsstoornis']"

De opdrachtgever was benieuwd op welke manier De Noordwijkse Methode geoptimaliseerd kan worden om de leermotivatie van leerlingen van groep 1 tot en met 3 te verhogen. Bij de ontwikkeling van De Noordwijkse Methode heeft de opdrachtgever gebruikgemaakt van de Zelfdeterminatietheorie (ZDT). De ZDT staat bekend als één van de bekendste motivatietheorieën uit de psychologie. De opdrachtgever heeft aangegeven dat het onduidelijk is in hoeverre leerkrachten op de hoogte zijn hoe de ZDT verwerkt is in De Noordwijkse Methode en in hoeverre zij die gebruiken in hun lessen. Daarom is het doel van dit onderzoek om De Noordwijkse Methode met de ZDT te vergelijken en het verband te onderzoeken tussen het ‘lesgeef-enthousiasme’ en ‘de perceptie van leerkrachten op het toepassen van de ZDT-elementen' in de lessen. Hierbij is gekeken naar lesgeef-enthousiasme, omdat dit net als de ZDT leermotivatie bevordert (Deci et al., 1981; Patrick et al., 2000; Reeve et al., 2004; Tsai et al., 2008). Hierbij is specifiek gekeken naar de onderbouw van De Noordwijkse Methode: groep 1 tot en met 3. Om deze twee hoofdvragen te kunnen beantwoorden is allereerst een deskonderzoek uitgevoerd waarin de elementen van de ZDT zijn vergeleken met de aangeleverde documenten vanuit de opdrachtgever. Daarnaast is een correlationeel onderzoek uitgevoerd waarbij een vragenlijst is afgenomen bij leerkrachten van De Noordwijkse Methode. Bij de vragenlijst is specifiek gekeken naar ‘de perceptie van leerkrachten op het toepassen van de ZDT’ en naar het’ lesgeef-enthousiasme’ Uit het deskonderzoek is gebleken dat niet alle drie de basisbehoeftes van De Noordwijkse Methode in gelijke mate voorkomen in de aangeleverde documenten. Daarnaast is uit het correlationele onderzoek een niet significant resultaat gekomen, waardoor geen sterke samenhang is gevonden tussen ‘de perceptie van leerkrachten op het toepassen van de ZDT’ en het’ lesgeef-enthousiasme’. Ten gevolge van dit onderzoek zijn concrete adviezen ontstaan voor de opdrachtgever met betrekking tot het optimaliseren van De Noordwijkse Methode op het gebied van motivatie van de leerlingen.",

OBIC helpt ouders die stress-, spannings- en vermoeidheidsklachten ervaren bij de opvoeding van hun kind. Waar andere interventies zich primair focussen op het kind, richt OBIC zich juist op de ouders. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te kijken hoe ouders van kinderen met gedragsproblemen OBIC-Ouderbegeleiding ervaren. Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: “Welke aspecten en elementen van OBIC-Ouderbegeleiding hebben volgens ouders meerwaarde bij het opvoeden van kinderen met gedragsproblemen?” Onder aspecten worden interne processen bij de ouder verstaan zoals zelfinzicht en emotieregulatie. Onder elementen worden de opdrachten van OBIC verstaan. Om antwoord te kunnen geven op de onderzoeksvraag is allereerst literatuuronderzoek gedaan naar zelfinzicht en emotieregulatie. Vervolgens is empirisch onderzoek uitgevoerd door middel van het afnemen van semigestructureerde interviews bij ouders die OBIC hebben gevolgd. Uit het literatuuronderzoek bleek dat zowel zelfinzicht als emotieregulatie belangrijk is bij de opvoeding van het kind. Een hoge mate van zelfinzicht en emotieregulatie dragen bij aan het algemeen welzijn van ouders. Zowel zelfinzicht als emotieregulatie zijn van grote waarde bij een positieve opvoeding van het kind. Het belang van zelfinzicht in het ouderschap werd ook door de resultaten van het huidige empirische onderzoek bevestigd: ouders gaven aan na het OBIC-traject te beschikken over meer zelfinzicht. Het belang van emotieregulatie bleef in het empirisch onderzoek daarentegen relatief onbesproken. Op basis van deze resultaten wordt aanbevolen om binnen OBIC meer te focussen op het verbeteren van emotieregulatie van ouders. Verder is het ook van belang om extra te focussen op de structuur van het OBIC-traject, aangezien structuur volgens sommige ouders ontbrak. In eventueel vervolgonderzoek zou onderzocht kunnen worden welke bijdrage de cliënt-therapeut relatie levert aan het succes van de interventie. Ouders leken de trainer en OBIC als één geheel te hebben ervaren, waardoor uitspraken doen over alleen OBIC, onafhankelijk van welke trainer, lastig is. Eventueel vervolgonderzoek zou zich ook kunnen richten op het individuele traject van ouders.

Hoewel deze methodiek tot op heden enkel wordt ingezet bij kinderen, kan het interessant zijn om te onderzoeken of de methodiek betekenisvol kan zijn voor jongvolwassenen. Zo rapporteerde de helft van de studenten uit het hoger onderwijs in 2021 angstige en depressieve gevoelens te ervaren. Daarom is gekozen om universitaire bachelor studenten als doelgroep te selecteren, en is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: ‘Kan Buts en Bofn een bijdrage leveren aan het mentale welzijn van universitaire bachelor studenten van de Universiteit Leiden?’ Om deze vraag te kunnen beantwoorden is er gekozen voor een kwalitatieve onderzoeksopzet waarbij elf vrouwelijke participanten deelnamen aan een sessie met het materiaal en vervolgens middels een interview hun ervaringen deelden. Ten eerste is de algemene waardering van Buts en Bofn onderzocht. Er is gebleken dat vrijwel alle participanten een positieve indruk hadden van het materiaal. Sommige participanten vonden het op het eerste gezicht kinderlijk overkomen, maar dit veranderde in een positieve indruk na de sessie. Verder hadden de participanten verschillende meningen over het werken met het materiaal. Ze waren positief over onder andere de vormgeving en de verschillende kleuren, maar hadden moeite met aspecten zoals de kleur-emotie associatie en het onderscheiden van hun gedachten en gevoelens. Daarnaast vonden enkelen het moeilijk om hun complexe emoties te identificeren. Ten tweede is onderzocht of studenten een groter bewustzijn en inzicht van de eigen emoties ervoeren door het werken met Buts en Bofn. Een aantal participanten rapporteerde dat zij een poppetje opgebouwd uit hun kwaliteiten als helpend ervoeren. Buts en Bofn was daarentegen minder helpend voor het begrijpen en interpreteren van emoties, omdat veel participanten aangaven dit al voldoende te kunnen. Bovendien werd aangegeven dat het materiaal kan dienen als ondersteuning van een gesprek, waardoor het uiten van en het praten over emoties gemakkelijker wordt. Daarnaast is er gevraagd aan de participanten of zij denken dat Buts en Bofn een bijdrage zou kunnen leveren aan het verminderen van hun eventuele negatieve gedachten. Participanten geven aan dat vooral het visuele aspect van Buts en Bofn en het bouwen van hun kwaliteiten bijdroeg aan het verminderen van hun negatieve gedachten. Om deze verandering tot stand te brengen is het van belang om herhaald met Buts en Bofn te werken. Herhaald werken zou tevens een positieve bijdrage kunnen leveren aan hun mentale welzijn. Concluderend kan Buts en Bofn worden ingezet bij vrouwelijke universitaire studenten, omdat zij rapporteren dat het een bijdrage zou kunnen leveren aan hun mentale welzijn. Op basis van de resultaten zijn de volgende adviezen gegeven. Herhalend werken met Buts en Bofn wordt aangeraden, met daarbij een focus op de kwaliteiten. Verder wordt er geadviseerd om een lijst of kaartjes met emoties aan te bieden om complexe emoties te kunnen duiden. Tevens wordt voorgesteld extra ondersteuning te bieden bij het onderscheiden van gedachten en gevoelens tijdens de sessie. Daarnaast wordt aanbevolen om Buts en Bofn niet als een losstaande methodiek in te zetten.

Kleur en vorm geven aan gevoel: Een onderzoek naar het verband tussen het gebruik van Buts en Bofn en emotieherkenning bij kinderen,"Meurs, Danielle van","['Rippe, R.C.A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het afgelopen studiejaar is er onderzoek gedaan naar de methode Buts en Bofn door studenten aan de Universiteit van Leiden. Tijdens een sessie met Buts en Bofn wordt er gewerkt met blokjes in verschillende vormen en kleuren. De blokjes kunnen kinderen helpen om hun gevoelens zichtbaar en bespreekbaar te maken (Buts en Bofn, 2023). In overeenstemming met de opdrachtgever, Jeanette van Tricht, is de volgende onderzoeksvraag geformuleerd: ‘In welke mate is er een verband tussen een sessie met de methode Buts en Bofn en het vermogen om emoties te herkennen bij anderen, bij kinderen in de leeftijdsgroep van 6 tot 12 jaar?’. Om deze onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden, is er data verzameld met behulp van de Emotion Recognition Task (ERT). Deze test is gebaseerd op en gevalideerd door wetenschappelijk onderzoek (Metrisquare, 2023; Kessels & Montagne, 2017). Bij het invullen van de ERT kregen de participanten gezichten te zien, die wisselende emoties uitdrukten. Van de participanten werd gevraagd om te beoordelen welke emotie bij de getoonde gezichtsuitdrukking hoort. Er is zowel een voor- als nameting afgenomen bij de participanten. Tussen deze twee metingen zat tenminste één sessie waarin de methode Buts en Bofn is ingezet. De resultaten van de ERT suggereren dat er een kleine vooruitgang is in het vermogen om emoties te herkennen van de participanten na een behandeling met Buts en Bofn. Dit wijst op een eventueel positief verband tussen Buts en Bofn en emotieherkenning. Daarnaast lijkt de emotie blijheid gemiddeld genomen het beste te wordt herkend. Naast dat de vooruitgang in testscores een verband kan hebben met de methode Buts en Bofn, zijn er ook andere mogelijke verklaringen voor de vooruitgang. Een mogelijke andere verklaring is bijvoorbeeld dat er sprake is van een leereffect. Er zou sprake zijn van een leereffect wanneer de prestaties van participanten op de ERT verbeteren doordat ze geleerd hebben om de emoties van specifieke gezichten te herkennen tijdens de voormeting (Leary, 2012). Verder kan de vooruitgang die is gevonden verklaard worden door een andere therapievorm die gelijktijdig werd gegeven of de kwaliteiten van de professionals. Voor het onderzoek werd er gestreefd naar minimaal 20 participanten. Dit aantal is niet gehaald. Uiteindelijk zijn er vijf participanten die de ERT volledig hebben afgerond. Een verklaring hiervoor is dat de professionals geen tijd of mogelijkheid hadden om mee te werken aan het onderzoek. Doordat de steekproefgrootte klein was, moesten de resultaten voorzichtig geïnterpreteerd worden. Daarnaast konden er geen statistische toetsen gedaan worden. De resultaten van de ERT zijn daarom visueel gemaakt om mogelijke patronen zichtbaar te maken. Op basis van de onderzoeksresultaten is er een advies gegeven aan de opdrachtgever. De kern hiervan is om te investeren in de gebruikerscommunity, zodat er in eventueel vervolgonderzoek meer duidelijk is over de frequentie en de manier waarop professionals Buts en Bofn inzetten. Dit kan gedaan worden door online feedbackformulieren, die de professionals naar de opdrachtgever sturen. Voor vervolgonderzoek moet er rekening gehouden worden met de beperkingen vanuit het huidige onderzoek. Zo werd er veel van de professionals gevraagd en was het gebruik van de ERT lastig. Door meer inzicht te krijgen in de gebruikerscommunity zou er in vervolgonderzoek een gerichtere onderzoeksvraag kunnen worden gesteld, waarbij mogelijke beperkingen al van tevoren kunnen worden voorkomen. Een ander advies is om kinderen die nog niet hebben gewerkt met Buts en Bofn, kennis te laten maken met de methode door te beginnen met makkelijk herkenbare emoties, zoals blijdschap en boosheid.","['Buts en Bofn', 'Emotieherkenning', 'ERT']"

"De Dual Probe Task als een betrouwbare methode om Attentional Bias to Threat (ABT) te meten: De relatie tussen ABT, trait anxiety en attentional control","Gonzales Bleumer, Yanaika","['Putman, P.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"ACHTERGROND: In dit onderzoek staat de relatie tussen Attentional Bias to Threat (ABT) en angststoornissen centraal. ABT is de vooringenomen neiging om te focussen op dreigende stimuli in de omgeving (vigilance) of juist het vermijden ervan (avoidance) en speelt een rol bij de ontwikkeling en het in stand houden van angststoornissen. Een belangrijk meetinstrument om ABT te meten, de Dot Probe Task, vertoont inconsistenties in de resultaten en een verminderde betrouwbaarheid. Daarom wordt de Dual Probe Task (DTP) geïntroduceerd als een beter alternatief om ABT te meten. Eerdere bevindingen dienen echter te worden gerepliceerd. HYPOTHESEN: In dit onderzoek werden drie hypothesen getest. Deze hadden betrekking op de correlatie tussen ABT en Trait Anxiety, tussen ABT en Attentional Control (AC), en de Interne Consistentie (IC) van de DPT bij cues van hoge dreiging. Dit werd getest aan de hand van een nieuwe methode: de Dual Probe Task. METHODEN: In dit onderzoek is gebruikt gemaakt van de Spielberger’s STAI-t, Derryberry’s Trait ACS en de Dual Probe Task. Deze laatste methode is een computertaak van 344 trials waarbij er tegelijkertijd twee cue afbeeldingen worden getoond. Deze afbeeldingen worden gevolgd door twee target letters. Hierna wordt alleen de letter die het beste is waargenomen gerapporteerd. Het resultaat van de test zou een afspiegeling moeten zijn van de aandachtsbias van de proefpersoon. RESULTATEN: Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat er geen significante verschillen zijn in de reactie op cues van milde en hoge dreiging. Ook werden er geen significante correlaties gevonden tussen ABT en Attentional Control. Tot slot bleek er wel sprake te zijn van een zeer hoge interne consistentie voor hoog dreigende cues. CONCLUSIE: Dit onderzoek biedt inzichten voor het verbeteren van meetinstrumenten in het onderzoek naar ABT en de behandeling van angststoornissen. Toch is er altijd ruimte voor verbetering. Zo moet gewenning aan dreigende afbeeldingen worden voorkomen, kunnen andere cue-delay tijden worden verkend en kan er worden nagedacht over het onderzoeken van een angstigere sample. Tot slot moet er kritisch worden gekeken naar de zeer hoge IC-waardes voor high threat gezien dit ook kan duiden op strategiegebruik door participanten en juist onbetrouwbare uitkomsten.",

A sample of 188 first-year students aged 18 to 25 years completed either the AEFI or ESQ, along with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A). Data on academic success (credits, resists, average grade) was obtained from school records. The quality of the two questionnaires was measured by means of internal validity through exploratory factor analyses (EFA), reliability through correlation coefficients and external validity through the comparison of AEFI and ESQ subscales to similar BRIEF-A subscales using Kendall’s tau-b. Next, Hierarchical Cluster Analyses (HCA) were conducted to create clusters of students. Subsequently, Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) were conducted to determine if the clusters significantly differed in EF. Lastly, Multivariate Analyses of Variance (MANOVA) were performed to investigate the differences in academic success between low and high EF clusters. Two from the 11 items were removed to ensure sufficient quality on all three quality measures of the AEFI. For the ESQ 24 from the 36 items (including seven complete subscales) were removed to ensure sufficient internal validity, and one subscale was removed to ensure sufficient reliability. The AEFI was deemed suitable for measuring Attention, Planning & Initiative, and SelfControl & Self-monitoring, while the ESQ was appropriate for measuring Sustained Attention, Organization, Flexibility, and Goal-directed Persistence. The HCA’s identified four distinct EF clusters for the AEFI and three distinct EF clusters for the ESQ. Results from the ANOVA indicated a statistically significant difference between the identified clusters for each subscale of both the AEFI and ESQ. However, results from the MANOVA’s indicated no significant multivariate effect of EF cluster on academic success for either of the two questionnaires. Both questionnaires demonstrated improvements through removal of low-quality items, with the AEFI showing higher overall quality. However, the AEFI and ESQ were both unable to distinguishing groups of students whose academic success is hindered due to low EF.","['Executive Functioning', 'Academic Success', 'First-Year Higher Education Students', 'Amsterdam Executive Function Inventory (AEFI)', 'Executive Skills Questionnaire (ESQ)', 'Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A)', 'Exploratory Factor Analyses (EFA)', 'Kendall’s tau-b', 'Hierarchical Cluster Analyses (HCA)', 'Analyses of Variance (ANOVA)', 'Multivariate Analyses of Variance (MANOVA).']"

Het maken van voorspellingen werd in eerder onderzoek vergeleken met andere generatieve leerstrategieën. In het huidige onderzoek wordt het maken van voorspellingen vergeleken met een passieve strategie: herhalen. Hierbij werd er gekeken naar de invloed van deze leerstrategieën op het onthouden van numerieke feitjes. Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd bij 111 participanten. De bedoeling was om inzicht te krijgen in het effect op verschillende leeftijdsgroepen, waarbij kinderen (10-13 jaar) vergeleken werden met jongvolwassenen (18-26 jaar). Daarnaast werd er in het huidige onderzoek gekeken naar het effect van prediction error (voorspellingsfout) op de leerprestaties in beiden leeftijdsgroepen. Ten slotte werd er onderzocht of goed gokken invloed heeft op de leerprestatie. Er werd een interactie-effect gevonden waarbij kinderen meer profiteerden van het maken van voorspellingen dan herhalen ten opzichte van jongvolwassenen. Bij jongvolwassenen was er geen significant verschil in het gebruik van leerstrategieën. Daarnaast werd gevonden dat zowel kinderen als jongvolwassenen beter presteren als er sprake is van verwachtingsconsistente voorspellingen en grote verwachtings-schendende voorspellingen. Er zou gesteld kunnen worden dat voorspellingen maken effectief is om te gebruiken bij het geven van instructie bij kinderen. Verder onderzoek is nodig om inzicht te krijgen in andere aspecten die invloed hebben op het maken van een voorspelling.","['voorspellen', 'prediction error', 'kinderen', 'jongvolwassenen']"

Krachttraining blijkt dit risico te reduceren. Een mogelijke mediator in dit verband is Locus of Control (LoC), de mate waarin je het gevoel hebt dat je invloed hebt op je leven. In dit cross-sectionele onderzoek is een samengestelde vragenlijst verspreid onder jongvolwassenen. Mate van krachttraining was de productscore van de duur en frequentie per week en subjectieve intensiteit, zoals gemeten met de MSEQ-SF. Depressiescore was de somscore van de PHQ-9. LoC was de somscore op de omgepoolde SOCS, met een hoge score voor meer externe LoC. Ook zijn enkele demografische gegevens uitgevraagd. Hypothesen waren dat krachttraining depressieve symptomen reduceert en dat dit gemedieerd wordt door LoC. Uit de mediatieanalyse bleek het totale effect (c) van mate van krachttraining op depressieve symptomen niet significant. Deel 1 van het indirecte effect (a) van mate van krachttraining op Locus of Control was wel significant. Deel 2 van het indirecte effect (b) van Locus of Control op depressieve symptomen, gecorrigeerd voor het directe effect (c’) en het directe effect (c’) van mate van krachttraining op depressieve symptomen, gecorrigeerd voor het effect van Locus of Control waren beide niet significant. Uit dit onderzoek bleek krachttraining depressieve symptomen niet te reduceren en er was geen mediërend effect van Locus of Control.

The Mediating Role of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in the Relationship Between Pain and Quality of Life in a Nursing Home Population With Dementia: A cross-sectional study in the Netherlands,"Çalışkan, Merve","['Smaling, H.', 'van Houdt, C.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms are related to a poorer quality of life (QoL). Due to the lack of cure for dementia, QoL becomes more important as an outcome measure or treatment goal for residents with dementia. It is fundamental to understand clinically relevant variables such as pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in relation to QoL, because knowledge on mediating effects of NPS on the relationship between pain and QoL might contribute to a practical model which in turn can help identifying factors that can be changed to maximize QoL. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between pain and QoL with NPS as a mediator. Methods: Cross-sectional data was collected from 27 residents with dementia in a nursing home in the Netherlands. The participants had dementia and had at least one NPS. The primary health care professionals filled out questionnaires containing the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, Quality of life in Late-Stage Dementia, and demographics. Pain was observed with the Pain Assessment in Impaired Cognition in rest moments and during activities of daily living (adl). A mediational analysis using the PROCESS macro of Hayes is performed to explore the associations via total, direct and indirect effects. Two models were tested, the first model contained pain in rest and the second model contained pain during adl. The models were adjusted for dementia severity and gender. Results: There was no significant indirect effect in either model, meaning no mediating role of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the relationship between pain in rest or during adl and quality of life in nursing home residents with dementia. A significant association was found between NPS and QoL in both models, in which more severe NPS were related to a poorer QoL (model 1: b = .20, p = .01, 95% CI [0.04, 0.36]; model 2: b = .20, p = .01, 95% CI [0.05, 0.36]. Conclusions: This study showed that more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with lower quality of life. Further longitudinal research is recommended to investigate the direction of the relationship for pain, QoL and NPS and to discover a precise outcome prediction model.","['Neuropsychiatric symptoms, pain, quality of life, dementia, mediation analysis']"
The Overthinking Abyss: The moderating effects of mentalization on the relationship between loneliness and suicidal ideation,"Jost, Simon",['Ronald Alvarez Bahamondes'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Suicidality has become the most common cause of death for younger individuals. With increasing suicide rates across the globe suicidal ideation (SI) has received a lot of attention not only because of its occurrence in a non-clinical population but also due to its predictive quality of suicidal behavior. Recent literature arising out of the COVID-19 era indicated that high loneliness is a predictor higher SI. Current theories of SI emphasized the identification of external risk factors for SI but have neglected the participating role of the self during SI. Objective: That is, the present paper aimed to introduce the ego function mentalization from the school of psychoanalysis and psychodynamics to illuminate the limitations of current SI theories. Consequently, this study investigated the moderating effects of mentalization on the link between loneliness and SI. Method and results: In this cross-sectional design, students aged 17-26 (N=112) filled out online, self-report questionnaires measuring SI, loneliness, and mentalization. The bivariate correlation test showed that loneliness is positively associated with loneliness (rs = .6, p < .001). Findings from the hierarchical analysis indicate that this positive relationship is moderated by mentalization (R2 = .425, b = .01, F (1,108) = 5.01, p = .027). In particular, the interaction effect of loneliness and SI suggests a strengthening of the link between loneliness and SI as mentalization scores increase. Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of mentalization as a moderator of the critical relationship between loneliness and SI in a non-clinical juvenile sample. In essence, the findings invite clinicians to introduce ego functions when investigating the emergence, maintenance, and progression of self-destructive ideation.","['Suicidal ideation', 'loneliness', 'mentalization']"

Measurement Invariance on the Influence of Marital Status on Machiavellianism,"Plas, Isa Van der","['Simpson-Kent, I.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Machiavellianism is one of the three Dark Triad traits and entails a manipulative and deceptive personality. Previous research has shown that people with strong Machiavellian traits have a preference for short-term relationships. If they do enter a long-term relationship, this relationship tends to last, partly due to manipulative tactics. A commonly used test is the MACH-IV, which contains three dimensions: Interpersonal Tactics, Cynical View of Human Nature, and Utilitarian Morality. In this study, these dimensions are treated as a three-factor model. The aim of this study is to see whether the three-factor model is appropriate for different marital statuses (Never Married”, “Currently Married”, and “Previously Married”). It was expected that “Never Married” would have the best model fit and the highest factor loadings and factor scores, followed by “Currently Married”, and then “Previously Married” with the worst fit and lowest factor loadings and factor scores. Tests were calculated with the use of a large, open-source dataset (N = 73,489). The goodness-of-fit scores of the separate groups were estimated and the results showed poor fit. An inspection of the factor loadings revealed that the group “Previously Married” obtained the highest factor loadings. The results of an ANOVA of the mean factor scores showed mixed results and no conclusive evidence for the hypotheses. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the interpersonal relationships of Machiavellian people and although the results of this study were inconclusive, it only further highlights our need for more research in this area.","['Machiavellianism', 'Measurement Invariance', 'SEM', 'Marriage']"

The influence of power construal on risk-taking: The role of regulatory focus,"Breeschoten, Nienke","['Scheepers, D.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"People who construe their power as a responsibility are often less likely to take risks than people who construe their power as an opportunity. The main objective of this research was to explore the connection between power construal and risk-taking and the role of regulatory focus. Regulatory focus theory distinguishes between a promotion focus and a prevention focus. Based on former research, we predicted that people who perceive their power more as responsibility and have a prevention focus take less risk. People who perceive their power more as opportunity and a promotion focus will take more risks. After dividing the sample (N=207) over power as responsibility and power as opportunity conditions, to manipulate power construal, tested the proposed hypotheses. There were no significant main effects. However, we found a negative significant effect of prevention focus on risk-taking. Also, while conducting exploratory research, we found an negative significant effect of prevention focus on financial risk specifically. In view of methodological improvements, further research is needed to find evidence for the proposed hypotheses and use the obtained results e.g. to develop interventions.","['power construal, opportunity, responsibility, prevention, promotion, regulatory focus, risk-taking,']"

Breaking The Dichotomy: The Relationship Between Anthropocentrism and Ecocentrism in International Corporate Environmental Law,"Haraldsdóttir Aspelund, Sóley Hrönn",['Rebecca Ploof'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In a value-oriented world there is an ongoing debate on how ecocentrism, anthropocentrism and their relationship should be conceptualized. Existing scholarship generally regards their relationship as dichotomous and uses this duality to argue that present laws aimed at holding businesses accountable for environmental harm do not function because they are anthropocentric in nature, necessitating an ecocentric approach. This research, however, disproves the idea of a strict dichotomy, arguing that anthropocentrism and ecocentrism may holistically be reflected within international corporate environmental legal frameworks. It does so by using a critical theory lens to conceptualize both anthropocentrism and ecocentrism, as well as their relationship. The theoretical findings are then put to the test through an analysis of the ecocide proposal. The academic and societal implications of the findings of this research are grounded in the more nuanced and holistic conceptualization of the value structures and their relationship. By questioning the dichotomy this research situates itself in a rich academic debate on how these value structures should be perceived in relation to one another, which ultimately translates to the shaping of public or societal discourse on the topic. Understanding the extent of the dichotomy of the two values is essential to avoid misapplying the theory behind the two when determining effectiveness of legal frameworks.","['Climate Politics, International Law, Anthropocentrism, Ecocentrism, Ecocide proposal']"
