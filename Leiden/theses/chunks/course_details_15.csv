Identification With all Humanity: An investigation into how dual identity can contribute to increasing identification with all humanity,"Engelen, Evie van","['Boezeman, E.', 'Scheepers, D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Identification with all humanity is an important construct for solving global issues but is often hard to achieve. Based on Optimal Distinctiveness Theory, it was predicted that exposure to a dual identity (comprising the most abstract social category: humanity in combination with another social category) could lead to a stronger identification with all humanity. With a dual identity, the excessive inclusiveness of humanity is compensated by the distinctiveness of a less inclusive social identity. The research started with a pre-measurement, then people were exposed to a dual identity in which humanity was combined with a social category (the neighborhood, city/village, the Netherlands, or Europe). Distinctiveness, inclusiveness, the degree of identification with the social category, and harmony with humanity were measured. After this manipulation, people completed the IWAH questionnaire, and their attitude towards global problems was measured. The results showed no significant difference between the experimental conditions and the control condition on identification with all humanity after the exposure to dual identity. However, people exposed to very inclusive social categories created more identification with all humanity and experienced more harmony than people in the less inclusive social category conditions. A relationship was found between identification with all humanity and a positive attitude towards solving global problems. Results are discussed in terms of a successful but reversed effect of dual identity. Theoretical and methodological reasons for the reversed effect are discussed and suggestions for further research are given.",

Thesis – Final Version,"Sannes, Martijn","['De Kwaadsteniet, E.', 'Van Dijk, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Introduction. In this study we set out to find out the effect of amount of information about others’ decisions in a volunteer’s dilemma (VOD) game and whether people higher on social value orientation (SVO) volunteer more often than people low on SVO. We hypothesized that people with no information about others’ decisions would volunteer more often than those with some information. Further, we hypothesized that people high on SVO would volunteer more often than low SVO people. Methods. Participants in groups of three were asked to perform our version of the VOD game, where they had to either give up five of their 10 points for the group to gain a reward. Not volunteering by anyone would end in everyone getting no rewards. Not volunteering in a group with at least one other volunteer in the group would yield the highest reward. Further, they were asked to fill out an SVO questionnaire. Statistical analysis. We performed a crosstab with Chi-Square test on condition x volunteer yes/no for hypothesis one. For hypothesis 2 we performed an LRA on volunteering yes/no on the predictor SVO angle score. Results. Chi-square test for our first hypothesis was non-significant which suggests that amount of information has no effect on people’s decision to volunteer. Wald’s Chi-Square test for our second hypothesis was significant and the B-value was positive. This suggests that higher scores on SVO does indeed result in more volunteering behaviour.",
War metaphors in advanced cancer: The influence of patient characteristics on the assessment of war metaphors,"Winter, Amber","['Vliet, L.M. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: War metaphors refer to advanced cancer as a ‘battle’ or ‘fight’ and are the most frequently used to describe complex, emotional and subjective experiences. There are different views on war metaphors. They can be helpful by creating a sense of pride and empowerment and can be harmful for patients by eliciting feelings of guilt and incompetence. It is not clear yet for which patients war metaphors are helpful or harmful. Objective: To determine which patient characteristics of patients with advanced cancer are related to the negative assessment of war metaphors and to explore what aspects of war metaphors are seen as harmful and what helpful alternatives are. Methods: Patients with advanced cancer (N = 74) assessed in an online questionnaire whether they think war metaphors are harmful or not and made suggestions about harmful examples and helpful alternatives. War metaphors are assessed using a dichotomous scale and background characteristics (information need, education, age, gender and acceptance) are dichotomized. Number of prior treatments were based on a self-created scale. (multiple) Logistic regression analyses assessed the relationship between background variables and war metaphor assessment. Results: Most (82%) patients viewed war metaphors as harmful. There were no significant effects between background characteristics and the assessment of war metaphors. The number of prior treatments showed a trend significance (p = .08;  = -.47, 95% CI: .37–1.06). Concerning percentages, higher educated (86%) and female participants (84%) perceived war metaphor more often as harmful. Concerning odds ratios, being higher educated was associated with negative assessment (OR = 2.02), as well as being female (OR = 7.58) and being older (OR = 2.07). None of these were significant. Conclusions: Since most patients with advanced cancer perceive war metaphors as harmful, we would advise clinicians to abstain from introducing war metaphors to patients who received multiple prior treatments. Clinicians should keep an eye on the patients’ own use of war metaphors and tailor their communication. When a war metaphor elicits positive emotions, using them can be helpful. More research with a bigger sample is preferred into the influence of background characteristics on war metaphors.","['war metaphors', 'advanced cancer', 'patient characteristics', 'palliative care']"

A comparison of machine learning techniques for combining heterogeneous neuroimaging data sources in the context of classifying individual clinical status,"Hovius, Luuk","['Wilderjans, T.F.', 'Weeda, W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The ability to correctly classify an individual’s clinical status could help pave the way for early treatment programs for disorders and illnesses of mental- and physical nature alike. Neuroimaging data could serve as a basis in reaching this goal of accurate classification. The use of said data, however, does come with challenges. A prominent one of which is the fact that neuroimaging data is highly dimensional, meaning that the amount of features largely exceeds the number of subjects within the data set. Furthermore, research has indicated that the use of heterogeneous, but complimentary, data derived from multiple modalities can be an asset to a model used in a classification setting (Zhang et al., 2010; Schouten et al., 2016). The challenge arises in how to combine the different modalities within a single model. A solution could be the use of machine learning algorithms which search for patterns in the data to draw conclusions. Current literature is, however, lacking meaningful comparisons between different machine learning techniques. Within this project, three different algorithms (support vector machines, Gaussian process classification and multiple kernel learning) have been selected to get insight into (1) whether or not machine learning is able to cope with challenges in the use of neuroimaging data, (2) the difference in performance between these methods and (3) whether or not the use of multiple modalities leads to better results in classification. To this end, 16 alcohol-dependent respondents have been selected along with 32 age-matched healthy controls and have been subjected to both MRI and PET. Models have been trained on data from both separate modalities and on data combining the two modalities. The performances of the models have been assessed by leave-one-subject-out cross-validation and expressed in balanced accuracy and area under the curve. Results indicate that the chosen methods are effective in overcoming challenges arising in the use of neuroimaging data as a means of classification. High balanced accuracies have been found ranging from 76.56% (GPC using PET data) to 100% (GPC using MRI data). Different situations are cause for different solutions and the right choice of algorithm seems to be dependent on, for instance, the fact if either unimodal- or multimodal data is used. Also, settings/optimization of parameters within the model can make a large impact on accuracy. It is therefore advised that researchers try different algorithms and settings before selecting a technique. Different options need to be weighed in order to receive the best possible outcome.","['Machine learning', 'MRI', 'PET', 'Classification', 'Neoroimaging']"

Stranger Danger: The Effect of Parental Verbal Expressions of Threat (versus safety) about Strangers on Child Fear Beliefs: The Moderating Role of Behavioral Inhibition,"Hoogsteder, Annabelle","['De Beurs, E.', 'Aktar, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous research showed that verbal threat information was associated with fear beliefs in children. The current study aimed to complement this research by investigating the acquisition of fear beliefs through the pathway of verbal parental threat information, whilst considering temperament. This multi-method experimental study investigated fear beliefs in 67 children (four to six years old) in a social learning paradigm. Children were exposed to verbal threat- or safe information from their parent about two strangers/judges. The fear beliefs were assessed for each of the strangers using an adaptation of a fear beliefs questionnaire. Additionally, Behavioral Inhibition (BI) was investigated to measure the child’s temperament. Parents reported their child’s BI in questionnaires. The findings revealed that threat information from the parents resulted in more child fear beliefs than safety information. BI did not predict variations in the effect of verbal threat information on children’s fear beliefs. The results showed that the verbal threat information pathway contributed to the acquisition of fear beliefs, but this effect was not moderated by temperament. The current study contributes to the previous literature on verbal parental information, by showing that parents’ verbal threat information contributed to the intergenerational transmission of fear beliefs.",
Leading-by-example in a Self-reliance Dilemma,"Herring, Monica","['Gross, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Collective action problems such as climate change, overfishing and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic can be tackled with large-scale cooperation. However, cooperation often deteriorates due to conflicts between collective and individual interests, even though collective action would result in more favorable outcomes for everyone. To protect oneself against the risks of cooperation failure, individual solutions to shared problems have been introduced, such as privatized healthcare and education. Unfortunately, these private alternatives to public goods may crowd out cooperation, leading to under-provision of public goods that benefit all members of society. The current study aimed to examine the role of leadership-by-example as a mechanism to facilitate group cooperation in a self-reliance dilemma, whereby participants confronted shared problems that could be solved either collectively or individually. Leadership was introduced by allowing one group member to set an example by choosing the cooperative or individual decision first. Both randomly assigned and endogenously self-selected leaders were investigated. We found that group members consistently preferred individual solutions when they were affordable, irrespective of leadership. However, no significant effects were found regarding the effect of leadership. While it is likely that a lack of statistical power led to these insignificant findings, it could be speculated that a lack of trust, risk aversion and lack of reciprocity may have played a role. These topics constitute interesting avenues for future research and would provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of leadership in coordinating collective action.","['collective action problems', 'social dilemma', 'self-reliance dilemma', 'cooperation', 'public goods', 'leadership-by-example']"
The Effect of Leadership on Self-reliance and Cooperation in a Social Dilemma,"Luijcks, Loeka","['Gross, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Humans cater for shared needs by establishing public goods, for example climate change mitigation. Yet, public goods face a free-rider problem, since public goods are non-excludable and often costly. If most individuals free ride, the public good can no longer be maintained. Experimentally, the free rider problem is investigated with the public goods game. In this game, individuals decide how much of their resources they want to keep and how much they want to contribute to a public good. Research showed that leading by example can help overcome the free rider problem, because leaders shape their followers’ contributions. But earlier research ignored the option for self-reliance. Individuals can also choose to invest in a private solution, instead of a public good. Cooperation may be harmed as a result of selfreliance and this raises the question whether leadership by example can influence participants opting for self-reliance. We therefore investigated how leadership by example can influence collaborations to a public good, using an online interactive decision-making experiment. Participants were assigned to a baseline condition, a random leadership condition or an endogenous leadership condition. In the experiment we confronted groups with monetary units which they could keep to themselves or allocate to either a public pool or a private pool. We showed that contributions increase with interdependence, but we did not found evidence that leadership influences cooperation rates. This suggest that future research needs to be carried out.",

Listening while being stressed: A fiasco or just fine? The Effect of Stress and Gender on Active Listening,"Haasnoot, Melissa","['Harinck, F.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Many recent studies have investigated stress, active listening, or gender, but none of them addresses all three of these factors at the same time. The present study investigated the effect of perceived stress on self-rated active listening for men and women. An online survey was administered to a group of adults (106 males and 297 females) aged 18-69 in the Netherlands. This survey consisted of items of The Active-Empathic Listening Scale (AELS) and the Stress scale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). Results revealed that higher perceived stress was associated with a greater decline in active listening among adults (p = .030). Independent t-tests revealed that women reported more active listening than men (d = 0.32, p <.001), however women did not report more stress than men (d = 0.14, p = .202). Finally, a regression revealed that the effect of stress on active listening seemed to be stronger for women than men (95% CI [0.00, 0.22], p = .054). Thus, women might be more vulnerable to the effect of perceived stress on active listening than men. Implications for future research are discussed.",
The relationship between active empathetic listening of the supervisor and employee well being explained: the role of employee stress appraisal and age,"Sonnemans, Pleun","['Harinck, F.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Because of limited research, this study aimed to expand current knowledge on the positive effects of active empathetic listening and go into the gap in research regarding the explanation of these positive effects. Therefore, the relationship between active empathetic listening of the supervisor and employee well-being, and the mediating role of employee stress appraisal and the moderating role of employee age in this relationship, were examined. The study was conducted using an online questionnaire among 374 Dutch employees. In the current study, active empathetic listening of the supervisor was positively associated with employee well-being. In addition, no evidence was found for neither the mediating role of employee stress appraisal nor the moderating role of employee age. Nevertheless, there were valuable associations found while testing these hypotheses. Active empathetic listening of the supervisor showed to be positively associated with resource stress appraisal of employees in stressful situations at work. Although more research is needed to further understand the relationship between active empathetic listening of the supervisor and employee well-being, and the positive effects of active empathetic listening itself, the importance of active empathetic listening of the supervisor concerning employee well-being and coping can be acknowledged.",

"Effects of Artificiality of the Face, Gender, and Violent Videogames on Emotion Perception","Jankowiak, Aleksandra","['de Kleijn, R.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Research concerned with emotion perception has typically relied on posed, static stimuli, and employed a forced-choice paradigm, limiting ecological validity and likely overlooking biases in perception. The current study employed an alternative methodology to assess differences in perception of real and matching avatar faces, as well as in their perceived intensity and judgment confidence. Additionally, the effects of gender of the perceiver, gender of the stimulus, and exposure to violence in videogames were examined. Seventy-nine participants were presented with 64 real and matching avatar expressions and rated the extent to which they perceived eight different emotions, as well as their judgment confidence and the intensity of the stimuli. On average, less happiness, and more anger and disgust was perceived in the avatar than real faces. Additionally, real stimuli received higher average ratings of intensity and confidence than their avatar counterparts. Finally, in contrast to previous research, gender of the stimulus and of the perceiver, as well as the exposure to violence in videogames had no effect on emotion perception. The cluster analysis uncovered several patterns in participants’ interpretations, suggesting unequivocal perception of emotions in stimuli. Overall, these findings suggest that the process of interpreting facial expressions is too complex and heterogenous to be fully captured by forced-choice paradigms. The study contributes to the field of emotion perception by proposing a methodology better suited to examine individual differences and biases in emotion perception.","['emotion perception', 'facial expressions', 'avatars', 'gender differences', 'violent videogames']"

The Barriers to Canadian Electoral System Reform: A Study into the Changing Positions & Motives of Political Elites,"Dunleavy, Seán","['Louwerse, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Taking an elite-centred approach, this paper analyses the recent attempted electoral reform initiative in Canada (national level), primarily focusing upon the most influential and powerful political actors throughout this process. In particular, the extent to which individual political elite motivations (both material and ideational) can help explain why reform attempts likely fail, will be of central interest. The theoretical framework, which is used to navigate this research puzzle, consists of the ‘barriers model’ by Rahat and Hazan (2009, 2011), and the related, ‘models of electoral system change,’ by Benoit (2004). By building upon ‘barriers model,’ in particular, this project seeks to increase academic understanding of the relationship between both material and ideational motivations, how such motivation types might be recognised, and importantly, how both interact in the context of proposed electoral reform. By using an exploratory process tracing methodology, the complex mechanisms associated with both types of political elite motives are examined. Overall, this study seems to confirm majority academic opinion, that material motivations are the key driving incentives behind whether electoral reform is likely to fail or succeed. However, that being noted, evidence from this research paper does, nonetheless, appear to suggest strong ideational incentives for both the removal and retention of the status quo. While the relationship between both motive types is complex, the use of ideational argumentation to mask more salient material motives does appear present throughout.",
Experience matters: the effect of political wings on rebel-to-party transitions,"Germain, Antoine","['Haer, R. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Despite the attention given by researchers to post-war rebel-to-party transitions and their determinants, the relationship between the presence political wings and the transition of rebel groups into political parties remains understudied. In order to fill this gap, this research proposal proposes a large-N statistical analysis of the rebel groups having successfully transitioned into a political party, for all civil wars having ended between 1975 and 2015. It is expected that the presence of political wings will increase the likelihood of rebel-to-party transitions because of two reasons. First, political wings allow rebel groups to expect electoral success, because they provide a legal venue in which supporters can express their support for the rebel group. Second, political wings provide rebel groups with experience and an organizational basis on which to found a political party, thus facilitating the transition of rebel groups to political parties. No evidence is found supporting this hypothesis, which means that political wings are not found to have any effect on rebel-to-party transitions. Still, future research should continue exploring the link between state-building processes and rebel-to-party transitions. While political wings might not play a role, the set up of state-like structures could.",
The surge of violence in armed conflict: the role of rebel fragmentation on the intensity of sexual violence,"Hemert, Marnix van","['Haer, R. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I examine the role of rebel fragmentation on the intensity of sexual violence during armed conflict. The linkage of both concepts has been neglected in the existing literature. In order to overcome this gap, I look at the influence of outbidding. The process of outbidding is the competing effect between two or more rival factions or rebel groups in the same territory and the subsequent surge in extreme violence. Using a single case study, I describe the preexisting levels of sexual violence by the SPLM and the intensity of sexual violence after the split. By doing so, I find evidence that the occurrence of rebel fragmentation is associated with higher intensities of sexual violence. More specifically, my findings conclude that the conflict dynamic of outbidding, and the subsequent reaction with violence by both groups, is a useful explanation for the increase in the levels of sexual violence in South Sudan. The result of this thesis adds to the existing literature on sexual violence and provides an incentive for further research on the matter.",

Vote against Sexual Violence? The History of Women’s Political Socialization on Sexual Violence during Armed Conflict,"Kempermann, Lena","['Haer, R. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I examine how women’s political socialization before a conflict is connected to the prevalence of sexual violence during conflict. The thesis contributes to the existing literature with its approach to a better understanding of sexual violence during conflict but also looking at how political socialization could favor certain behavior in conflict. Moreover, it opens a new field that distinguishes between peace and conflict times but acknowledges the importance of socialization before a conflict. The main argument is that the longer women had the chance to participate politically, the more influence they should have had on socialization, and the less sexual violence should happen during conflict. This is based on three mechanisms: women’s value in a society, gender stereotypes and women’s ability to change policies. The hypothesis will be tested in a large-N analysis by using Ordinal Logistic Regression. Two independent variables are being used in order to look at women’s political socialization: the duration of female suffrage and women’s legislative power before the conflict start. The results show that especially the duration of female suffrage can be associated with a lower prevalence of sexual violence during conflict. Against the expectations, it does not make a difference how much legislative power women had in the pre-conflict society. Female suffrage, however, can be seen as an important point in the socialization processes for women and men that has a negative effect on conflict-related sexual violence the longer it has been established.",
From water to war: water scarcity and political behavior at the micro-level,"Holst, Annabel van der","['Haer, R. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Environmental scarcity scholars believe that the scarcity of renewable resources an important contributor to violence and conflict in states belonging to the global south. Water scarcity is becoming increasingly problematic, especially in less developed states. Existing literature has mostly focused on the macro-level and has overlooked the individual's experience of water scarcity. Existing literature mostly focuses on armed conflict and fails to address the impact water scarcity on different types of political behavior. Investigating the individual level can be more concise in explaining the likelihood of political participation. Using the theoretical concept of relative deprivation and quantitative analysis, the relation between water scarcity and individual violent political behavior is investigated in the African continent using disaggregated data from the Afrobarometer. The impact of relative water scarcity is measured to determine whether water scarcity contributes to the propensity of an individual to use violence instead of other means of political participation. No evidence is found that relative water scarcity impacts voting behavior. Both the propensity of demonstration behavior and the propensity of using violence are negatively impacted by relative water scarcity. Therefore, no evidence is found that water scarcity increases the propensity of individuals using violence instead of other political means.",
Heart rate variability and functional connectivity patterns of large-scale brain networks: Testing basic assumptions of the extended Neurovascular Integration Model,"Stiller, Carlo","['Rover, M. de', 'Sieh, D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"BACKGROUND: Cortical correlates to heart rate variability (HRV) are assumed to involve interconnectivity between single brain areas and large-scale brain networks (LSN) in the extended neurovascular integration model (NVI). Among those are the CEN and the DMN from the triple network model (TNM) and the anterior insula (AI) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (DACC). This study aimed to test if AI and DACC are involved as the SN in FC patterns that correlate to HRV. Second, it was tested if LSN show FC patterns in accordance with the TNM during experimental tasks. METHODS: 27 female participants (18- 35 years) took part in this cross-sectional fMRI study. Experimentally induced FC patterns of the three LSN with HRV as a covariate were used for the statistical model. RESULTS: As hypothesised, the CEN showed significantly more intrinsic FC during the WMT which was associated with HRV. Further, there was an association between HRV and the FC between the CEN and AI/ACC, respectively. Against the hypothesis, an involvement of the full SN could not be confirmed. The results concerning the DMN disconfirm the hypothesis of an increased FC during the rumination condition. Lastly, a trend was visible for lower HRV during the WMT compared to the rumination condition, but this difference did not reach the significance level. CONCLUSION: The present results confirm the AI and ACC as autonomous brain regions involved in FC patterns associated with HRV. This confirmation of the NVI opposes the unexpectedly high FC pattern of the DMN during the WMT, which points to explanatory gaps in the external validity of the model and the role of LSN vs. single brain regions as associates of HRV.","['Rumination', 'physiology', 'fMRI', 'large-scale brain networks']"
Neurocognitive Mechanisms Supporting Learning from Social Feedback about the Self in Adolescence: Links with Parenting Climate,"Kiyui, Kimberly","['Middelkoop, H.', 'Ruitenberg, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The valuation of one’s self-worth, i.e., self-esteem, is derived from social feedback throughout life. During adolescence, the period between ages 10 to 19, many changes occur in one's social environment– peers gain importance, and dependency on parents decreases. However, parents continue to influence self-esteem. Although the early parent-child relationship has been linked to self-esteem formation, it is unclear how perceived parenting climate influences self-esteem updating in adolescence in response to peer feedback, as these mechanisms have only been studied in young adults (individuals aged 18–25). This study used self-reports about perceived parenting, alongside computational modelling and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how parenting climate co-varies with neurocognitive mechanisms supporting self-esteem formation in 61 healthy adolescents (Mage = 15.8; SD age = 1.42). The adolescents performed a social evaluation task during fMRI scanning which required them to predict “likes” or “dislikes” from two groups of raters and to rate their self-esteem every 2 to 3 trials. Using a computational model, we extracted a set of variables about the adolescents’ self-esteem in response to the task and performed a canonical correlation analysis to link it to a set of self-reports collected about parenting climate. The canonical correlation analysis yielded a single significant canonical dimension, Wilks’s λ = 0.04, F(117,305) = 1.35, p = 0.022, which we labelled “positive parenting”. “Positive parenting” was associated with high levels of perceived maternal care, low maternal conflict, and low emotional abuse. Adolescents scoring higher on this dimension exhibited more responsive, fluctuating self-esteem (higher self-esteem instability) compared to their lower-scoring peers, 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑑 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑜𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑤1 = 0.31. Our study in adolescents did not find activation in neural regions that were previously proposed to represent the neural processes underlying self-esteem formation in young adults (VS/sgACC: z = 1.84, p = 0.065; vmPFC: z = 0.50, p = 0.618). Lastly, adolescents scoring lower on this dimension did not present with a neural phenotype of psychiatric vulnerability previously found in young adults (AI responses to SPEs ρ(59) = 0.028, p = 0.831; insula-vmPFC functional connectivity ρ(59) = 0.045, p = 0.731). This study suggests that more responsive, fluctuating self-esteem associated with the “positive parenting” dimension may be adaptive in the developmental stage of adolescence, and that developmental differences may be present in neurocognitive mechanisms supporting self-esteem updating in adolescents versus in young adults.","['Self-esteem', 'social feedback', 'parenting climate', 'positive parenting', 'adolescence']"
“Knowing thy neighbour” in times of ethnic conflict: Charting the effect of neighbourhood composition on levels of ethnic violence,"Keenan, Andrew","['Haer, R. vam der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I explore the relationship between ethnic violence and neighbourhood ethnic composition during times of ethnic civil conflict. Much of the existing literature utilises either the ethnic competition theory or the ethnic segregation theory to explain ethnic conflict. These theories offer conflicting results; I attempt to address this by using a relatively novel unit of analysis: the neighbourhood and applying it nationwide rather than limiting it to specific cities or urban areas. My argument is based on Allport’s (1954) intergroup contact theory. I connect a fall in prejudice on an individual level to a fall in prejudice on the group level. I argue that intergroup contact is more likely to occur in ethnically mixed neighbourhoods and subsequently link falling prejudice to falling rates of violence. I therefore hypothesise that ethnic violence will be lower in mixed than in segregated neighbourhoods during ethnic conflict. I select Northern Ireland as a case study for my research because it is highly polarised, it has a widely dispersed population of its two principal ethnic groups, it is a likely candidate for the ethnic competition theory, and because it has an abundance of data. I then test my hypothesis, firstly by means of a two-sample Z test for proportions, and subsequently by using a logistic regression model. Contrary to my theoretical expectation, I find no significant relationship between the ethnic composition of a neighbourhood and levels of ethnic violence.",

Ten Days of Taglit-Birthright: Argentinian Heritage Tourism and Israeli Nationalism,"Skoglund, Einar","['Longo, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Taglit, also known as Birthright, is a free 10-day trip to Israel offered to all Jews in the world between the ages of 18 and 32. Taglit-Birthright can be understood as a nation-building program, which inculcates a nationalistic vision of Jewish peoplehood on participants. This thesis critically analyzes what this nationalistic vision entails through an interpretive study. For that purpose, ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with former Taglit participants from Argentina. Thereby, the thesis analyzes Taglit’s vision of homeland and people, as well as the role of rituals in promoting nationalistic stances. By using Argentinian’s subjective experiences as a “breaching mechanism” to understand Israeli nationalism, the thesis contributes not only to literature on Taglit, but also to literature on nationalism and Zionism. The thesis concludes that Taglit-Birthright promotes a vision of Jewish peoplehood which (1) claims politically contested territory as part of a Jewish homeland and (2) justifies militarism and Jewish statehood by framing it as a necessary response to the Nazi holocaust.",

The Abject an Object of Desire: Identity Formation of Female Adoptees from China in the Netherlands,"Rog, Johanneke","['Longo, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study shows the effects of unrecognised racism and the ‘unknown’ on identity formations of female Chinese adoptees in the Netherlands through 13 in-depth semistructured interviews. It contributes to existing literature on adoption, revealing limitation of the usage of Homi Bhabha’s Third Space in adoption literature. A struggle between the superego and the abject hinders identity formation. This research shows how a conflicting attraction and retraction of the unknown, the abject, shapes the search for identity. At the same time this thesis exposes a gap in migration literature. The adoptee, an unusual migrant, is underrepresented in political science literature. This study offers a corrective by introducing post-colonial theory and psycho-analysis to the question of the (unusual) migrant. Three recurring themes among the data were: (i) external identification schemes that cause internal social-psychological struggles; (ii) a conflicting attraction and retraction towards a ‘lost’ identity; (iii) the consequences of a lack of knowing.",
Locating Belonging in ‘Deeply Divided Societies’: Exploring the Northern Irish Identity,"Kirkwood, Danielle","['Longo, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study aims to correct the tendency for consociational and divided society literature to focus solely on institutionally accommodating ethnic division and overlook the agency of the individual. The Good Friday Agreement was intended to uphold and respect two separate, but equal Unionist and Nationalist “communities,” deemed to have intrinsically “diverse identities and traditions” in Northern Ireland (The Agreement, 1998). Twenty-three years later, with the increasing popularity of a ‘Northern Irish’ identity, this study undertakes indepth, interpretive interviews to discover why individuals identify as “Northern Irish,” and how they understand their own belonging in relation to the formal identities recognised within the Good Friday Agreement. Ultimately it seeks to answer: How does the ‘Northern Irish’ identity challenge the boundaries within a deeply divided society? This is answered by utilising the theory of belonging to reveal the fluidity and complexity of self-identification in a post-conflict society. Contrary to divided societies’ literature which is predicated on entrenched, polarised groups, the existence and increasing use of the Northern Irish identity shows the need for a non-combative and unique identifier. It reveals an inflexibility within the literature that results in an inability to recognise a post-conflict social need for change.",
A Prolegomenon to Partition: Greek-Cypriot Elite Rhetoric and the “Settler Problem”,"Lamnisos, Tasos","['Longo, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"While examining the persistence of partition in ethno-nationally divided polities ranging from the Balkans to the Middle East, the two competing logics of partition literature (ethnic spoils; ethnic security dilemma) are limited by their sole focus on military/security or economic factors. To overcome such a theoretical limitation, this qualitative study, which employs a Discourse-Historical Approach (DHA), offers an interpretative account of the discursive elements of enduring partition through an investigation of the rhetoric of Greek-Cypriot elites regarding the presence of Turkish settlers/migrants in Northern Cyprus. Previous research on the “settler problem” emphasizes that it is a question of demographics in both public and elite discourse(s). In contrast, by utilizing the middle-way approach to native-settler relations and the Agambenian state of emergency to explain the generative role of partition and its influence on the rhetoric of elite figures, this study finds that, from 2004 (t = 0) to 2017 (t = 1), Greek-Cypriot elites combined the discursive strategies of demographic imbalance, securitization, and racialization to frame the supposed “settler problem”. This discursive inquiry that probes a purposive sample of primary and secondary textual sources (N = 60) provides a new window into the role of enduring partition in generating the discourse of political elites and counters monolithic understandings regarding the presence of Turkish settlers/migrants. Therefore, providing a framework for future studies that aim to understand the influence of partition on the rhetoric of “native” elites about “non-native” groups both in the island of Cyprus and in other socio-politically divided societies.","['framing', 'discourse-historical approach', 'partition', 'settlers', 'migrants', 'greek-cypriot elites', 'northern cyprus']"
How do Greek-Roma perceive and interpret the notions of home and homeland?

This study examines the perception and interpretation of the notions of home and homeland as well as the sense of belonging by the settled Greek Roma in Greece. For this reason, open-ended, semi-structured, in-depth interviews have been conducted with a number of Greek Roma individuals. As expected, the ideas of the subjects of the research about the concept of home revolve around the institution of family. This implies that their interpretation of home befits more the abstract (non-physical) conceptualization of home. In addition, however, to these answers and despite the apparent duality of identity, the interviewees feel as homeland the country they live in and that is because they are essentially Greeks. This finding contrasts a significant part of the literature that suggests that Roma have either no homeland or feel a nostalgic recollection of a distant historical homeland in India.",
"Undocumented life and autonomy: How do undocumented migrants, despite being excluded from the state, strive for autonomy in their lives?","Leendertse, Leanne","['Longo, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"It is estimated that there are between 62.320 and 113.912 undocumented migrants in The Netherlands (Van de Sande & Muijsenbergh 2017, 649). Undocumented migrants are excluded from the state through the process of illegalization. This means that they have less legal and political rights (Arent 1973; Walzer 1983; Krause 2008) and often become the target of hostile treatment (Khosravi 2007; Halsworth & Lea 2011). This position of structural vulnerability creates obstacles for striving towards autonomy. With the use of ethnographic methods this research aims to get an in-depth understanding of how undocumented migrants in The Netherlands find ways to strive for autonomy. It explores how in spite of being excluded from the state and in spite of facing formal and informal obstacles, undocumented migrants gain autonomy to strive for a certain course of action in their lives. With the help of community and support organizations undocumented migrants find alternative integration mechanisms that enable to live their lives in autonomy. Through describing the lived experience of undocumented migrants, this research aims to offer a critique of the illegalization practices of the state, which in an unnatural manner disadvantages many migrants.",

Hold me tight: a relationship enhancement program for couples with a future of Huntington’s disease,"Petzke, Tara","['Janssen, V.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"A positive predictive genetic test for Huntington’s disease (HD) can be a life-changing event for both carriers and their partners, leading to an increased number of separation and divorce in this population as well as lower wellbeing and resilience. The “Hold me Tight” program (HmT), an emotionally focused couples’ therapy, aims at strengthening the couple bond by targeting attachment needs. In this study, we apply the HmT program to presymptomatic HD gene mutation carriers and their partners. To this end, we included 15 couples in a stepped wedge design using 3 baselines of varying length and 17 measurements in total. Our intervention consisted of 4 sessions spanning over 4 weeks, with measurements before, during, and after the intervention. We assessed relationship satisfaction and wellbeing self-report measures on a weekly basis, while resilience data was assessed at the beginning and the end only, and attachment style was assessed only at the beginning. We conducted a multi-level model on the data. Over the course of the study, wellbeing (𝑏 = −0.0075, 𝑝 = .001) and relationship satisfaction (𝑏 = 0.31, 𝑝 < .0001) improved, but resilience did not. Furthermore, all three outcome measures were moderated by secure attachment style. In conclusion, HmT improved the wellbeing and relationship satisfaction of couples with a future of Huntington’s Disease. Due to the improvements in these measures and high patient acceptability rates, we think this intervention could become a standardized procedure in regular HD care.","['Huntington’s Disease', 'Resilience', 'Wellbeing', 'Relationship satisfaction', 'Attachment', 'Hold me Tight']"

The implementation of Beyond GDP: the idea versus interest debate,"Spitzen, Floris","['DeRock, D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This paper answers the question “Why is the concept of Beyond GDP mostly implemented on the local level, and not on the national level?”. Global Domestic Product (GDP) has seen a lot of critique on how it is measured, and in the recent years the concept of Beyond GDP has become more prominent. In short, Beyond GDP looks not only at economic development, but also at other indicators such as education and health. However, Beyond GDP has been mostly implemented on the local level, and not on the national level. This paper argues that the idea versus interest debate also applies for this topic. The paper proposes that ideas of policy makers do matter, and that the interest of powerful actors also play a role in this debate. The results of this paper find that ideas of policy makers do indeed matter and are important in the debate to move from GDP to Beyond GDP, both on the national and local level. On the other hand, interest play a mixed role, being somewhat important on the national level, but not important for the local level.",

Population Puzzle: An Assessment of the Influence of Hindu Nationalism on Demographic Policymaking in India,"Seekermann, Ysabel","['DeRock, D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Continuous human expansion on a planet with finite resources has intensified a variety of polluting practices and resulted in major resource inequality across the globe. Though the idea that population control is an appropriate solution to the issue of overpopulation has seemingly disappeared from the sphere of politics since the mid 90’s, this thesis considers the resurgence of discussions to adopt a more coercive approach toward population management in India by investigating the extent to which Hindu nationalism influences contemporary demographic policymaking in India. While India’s Hindu nationalist legislators maintain that such a policy is a necessity considering the looming environmental crisis and lack of sufficient resources, there is a considerable disconnect between such claims and the country’s current demographic development. Therefore, this thesis aims to unveil governmental motivations behind the push for a two-child policy by examining policymakers’ attitudes and their framing of population growth as a justification for the novel two-child policy proposal.",
"Not As Simple As Going To the Polls: The Relationship between Race, Ethnicity, Polling Place Closures, and Voter Turnout in the United States","Roozendaal, Luuk van","['Louwerse, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Recent reports of a large number of polling place closures in the Southern United States after the Supreme Court’s Shelby County v. Holder (2013) decision sparks interest in the factors surrounding polling place closures and the consequences of these closures. Because little is known about the subject, this paper aims to give more clarity on these factors and consequences. It hypothesizes (1) that polling place closures have a negative effect on voter turnout; (2) that counties with a larger minority population experience more polling place closures than counties with a smaller minority population, (2a) especially in states where the Republican party has unified control over state government; and (3) that the negative effect of polling place closures on voter turnout is larger in counties with a larger minority population. Using county-level data from the 2008, 2012, and 2016 presidential elections, this paper finds no support for H1, showing that polling place closures do not have a significant effect on voter turnout. While polling place closures lead to less physical turnout, they are associated with increases in absentee turnout. It finds mixed results for H2, H2a, and H3. This paper is the first of its kind in testing these relationships in a US-wide large-N observational study. Because of the inconclusive nature of its results and the general lack of academic research into the topic, this paper advocates for more research into polling place closures and their connection to race, ethnicity, and voter turnout.",
Migration and integration discourse in Dutch politics: The impact of the European refugee-crisis of 2015 on the migration and integration discourse in Dutch parliamentary debates,"Schreurs, Naomi","['Louwerse, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis delves into how the so-called 'European refugee crisis' of 2015 impacted the parliamentary migration and integration discourse in the Netherlands. The study focuses on the eleven parties in the Second Chamber of the Netherlands during the Cabinet Rutte- Asscher (2012-2017). The expected changes in the Dutch parliamentary discourse are the use of the 'frame of reason' to bring together contrary discourses and the criminalization of refugees by left-wing parties. This thesis remains open to other changes in discourse by using a grounded theory approach to discourse analysis. In this way, the migration and integration discourse can be studied in an open-minded and differentiated way. This thesis shows that most elements of the ‘frame of reason’ were used during the refugee crisis and that a separation of left-wing parties occurred in which some left-wing parties started to criminalize refugees. In line with Waerniers & Hustinx (2019), a conditionality of residence rights and citizenship for different types of migrants emerged in the debate. Mair's (2009) concepts of responsiveness and responsibility were used to offer a possible explanation for the shifts in the discourse of the parties in government.","['refugee crisis', 'migration', 'integration', 'Dutch parliamentary discourse', 'grounded theory']"

Therefore, a new approach has been suggested: the mixed institutionalised approach. The present experimental scenario study (N = 361, all with UK nationality) explored the impact of compensation approach (fully institutionalised vs. mixed institutionalised vs. voluntary approach) on project acceptance, with bribery perceptions and perceived involvement of the community in decision-making, as potential mediators in this relationship. In addition, project developer reputation (good vs. bad) was manipulated to examine whether it moderated effects of compensation approach on project acceptance. Results showed no difference in project acceptance between the three compensation approaches. Since it was expected that project acceptance would be highest for the mixed institutionalised approach, the hypothesis was not supported. Additionally, bribery perceptions and perceived involvement did not mediate the relationship between compensation approach and project acceptance even though it was predicted they would. However, these did mediate the relationship between project developer reputation and project acceptance. A positive reputation led to lower bribery perceptions and higher perceived involvement, resulting in higher acceptance of windfarm sitings. Finally, project developer reputation did not moderate effects of compensation approach on project acceptance, opposing the hypothesis. This research concludes that a best approach to providing community benefits might not exist and highlights the importance of a good reputation.",

An experimental scenario study (N = 361) with a 3 (Institutionalization: Fully-institutionalized vs. mixed-institutionalized, vs. voluntary) x 2 (Reputation: Good vs. bad) factorial between-subjects design was conducted with project acceptance, perceived involvement and bribery perception as dependent variables. A mixed institutionalized compensation scheme was expected to lead to higher levels of project acceptance, irrespective of the project developers’ trust reputation. Moreover, a fully institutionalized compensation scheme was expected to lead to more project acceptance than a voluntary compensation scheme in the case of a project developer with a bad reputation but not for one with a good reputation. The results provided limited evidence regarding the effectivity of the compensation schemes in achieving high project acceptance. Contrary to expectations, a voluntary scheme resulted in more project acceptance than a fully institutionalized scheme. This effect was explained by the voluntary scheme leading to more perceived involvement which in turn increased project acceptance. Additionally, the analyses showed that a good trust reputation results in higher project acceptance through reduced bribery perceptions and increased perceived involvement.",['Community compensation']
A more comprehensive explanation of view on why states derogate from their human rights obligations in time of crisis,"Winter, Esmee de","['Macaj, G.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The derogation clause of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) allows states to limit the exercise of most human rights in time of war and public emergencies threatening the life of the nation. To fight off the exceptional circumstances brought by the COVID-19 global pandemic, governments are extensively restricting human rights. Almost all states have introduced emergency measures, however only ten Member States of the Council of Europe have formally derogated from the ECHR by notifying the Secretary General. This thesis will attempt to explain why some states derogate from their human rights obligations whilst others do not when they take emergency measures. The thesis will move beyond the already existing theory of which states derogate and why they do so by looking at the differences within regime type rather than only looking at regime type. By comparing two very similar countries, Latvia and Lithuania, which only differ on whether they have derogated or not, the dissimilar element that will be found is likely to be the explanatory variable on why some states derogate whilst others do not. The willingness of states to maintain parliamentary democracy in time of crisis, seems to be the explanatory variable for why some states derogate when taking emergency measures whilst others do not derogate when taking emergency measures. In the end, this thesis would like to generate a more thoroughgoing view on why states derogate in time of crisis.",

Scholars have not fully agreed whether the urban/rural divide could play an explanatory role in Eurosceptic voter behavior, where different scholars either state that such a divide matters, where others say the contrary. Using theoretical narratives from a variety of scholarly literature, this paper reinvestigates the urban rural divide in Euroscepticism. Using the European Values Survey, this study quantitatively assesses the impact of the urban/rural divide in Eurosceptic views among respondents in the candidate countries of the European Union. The candidate countries were chosen for the analysis as it offers a fresh new insight into the discussion, as quantitative research on these countries has not been conducted in the past. Statistical analysis has shown that in the candidate countries, the urban/rural divide does not play a significant explanatory role in Eurosceptic views among respondents. It is thus recommended that other explanations are treated with a higher level of importance in Eurosceptic voting behavior rather than the urban/rural divide.",

In this experimental scenario study, 361 British participants took the position of a resident facing this hypothetical situation. They learned that the project developer had a positive or negative reputation, and that compensation was being offered by one of three approaches: voluntarily, institutionalized through law, or by a mix of the latter with local involvement in the decision regarding compensation amount. Regardless of the project developer’s reputation, it was predicted that the mixed approach would result in higher local wind farm acceptance, compared to the other approaches. The local acceptance level was expected to be moderated by reputation for the voluntary approach: with a negative reputation leading to lower local acceptance compared to the fully institutionalized approach. Finally, the effects of project developer reputation and compensation approach on local wind farm acceptance were predicted to be mediated by perceptions of bribery and local involvement. The results demonstrated that voluntarily providing compensation led to greater local wind farm acceptance than institutionalizing compensation, whilst the mixed approach did not differ from either approach. When a negative reputation was made salient, the mixed approach resulted in greater bribery perceptions than both of the other approaches. Lastly, a partial mediation indicated the importance of project developer reputation for wind farm sitings: with a positive reputation found to elicit lower bribery perceptions, higher perceived involvement, and as a result, greater overall local wind farm acceptance, than a negative reputation.","['community compensation', 'project developer reputation', 'local acceptance', 'perceived involvement', 'bribery perceptions']"

Consociationalism on Europe’s Periphery: A Comparative Analysis on Institutional Stability in Post-Conflict Northern Ireland and North Macedonia,"Stone, Nathan","['Macaj, G.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines in a comparative fashion the experiences of two post-conflict European polities, the Republic of North Macedonia (hereafter “North Macedonia”, for ease of reference, regardless of the state’s official name at the historical moment in question) and Northern Ireland. It seeks to answer the puzzle of why the Northern Irish experience has been characterised by institutional instability and periodic collapse, in contrast with the far more stable institutional performance in post-conflict North Macedonia, in spite of their manifold similarities as cases. Through analysis of the electoral performance of extreme parties in both jurisdictions, and process-tracing of certain instances of particular instability and crisis, it tests hypotheses surrounding the distinctive roles of the European Union in both polities and the effect of electoral systems on consociational governing structures. The findings suggest that, contrary to what the literature would lead one to suspect, Northern Ireland’s instability cannot be attributed to any significant degree to its electoral system, and that a more salient point of difference lies in the European Union’s scope for direct action in North Macedonia, whilst calling for further research on the distinction between intra- and inter-communal crises.",

Modulating Cognitive Flexibility Through Associative Learning and Personality: The Influence of Context and Need for Cognition on Task Switching,"Marten, Luisa","['Dooren, R. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous research has emphasized the trade-off between cognitive stability and flexibility. Our main research aim within the present study was to assess whether demand on cognitive flexibility can become associated with specific stimulus contexts (i.e., locations), whether these learned associations are being transferred to a subsequent phase, and whether such associations correlate with need for cognition. In 107 participants we assessed switch costs both in terms of reaction times and error rates in a learning phase where task switch frequencies were manipulated across two contexts (25%/75%) and a subsequent diagnostic phase where task switch frequencies were balanced. We further included individual differences in need for cognition in the analyses, which we measured using the NCS-6 questionnaire. As expected, we found a reduction in switch costs in the high task switch frequency context in the learning phase. We did not observe the expected transfer of effects to the diagnostic phase, but instead an unexpected increase in switch costs in the previous high task switch frequency context. Moreover, there were no modulations of effects by need for cognition. However, there were increases in switch costs during the diagnostic phase for participants who showed a response to the manipulation during the learning phase. Altogether, our results suggests that context indeed plays a role in our ability to adjust to demand on cognitive flexibility. Facilitating associations between these two can modulate task switching performance in terms of speed and accuracy.","['cognitive flexibility', 'task switching', 'associative learning', 'need for cognition']"

Making participants of an anticommons game aware of externalities was expected to increase cooperation, by decreasing their willingnessto-accept (WTA) values, i.e. the amount they would be willing to accept in order to allow other individuals to make use of the resource. The results of the computer-based anticommons game (N = 167) did not support this hypothesis. However, the results did show, as predicted, that the more prosocial participants were, the more easily they allowed access to the resource by setting lower willingness-to-accept (WTA) values. Additionally, the hypothesized interaction effect between externalities awareness and Social Value Orientation (SVO) was not confirmed. Proselfs’ behavior did not change significantly more than prosocials’, after they got aware of the externalities. Finally, the negative effects of uncertainty in cooperation are discussed.","['anticommons', 'commons', 'social dilemmas', 'externalities', 'awareness', 'social value orientation', 'willingness-to-accept', 'decision-making', 'uncertainty']"
The Impact of Reward Anticipation on the Precision of Long-Term Memory,"Wight, Genevieve","['Lloyd, B.', 'Van Elk, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The impact of reward anticipation on the precision of long-term memory is important to study as further insights into how different factors affect different aspects of memory will guide us in understanding illnesses associated with poor memory and help develop potential treatments. Thirteen healthy participants took part in a memory task in which memory accuracy, confidence, and precision were measured. Across a two day study, participants looked at objects and placed them in specific places on a computer screen based on whether or not the category of the objects was rewarded or not and performed a short number comparison task that indicated how much reward they would receive. Participants then came in on day two to do a surprise memory test on the objects seen on day 1. The also rated their confidence in that assessment, and indicated where on the screen they placed these objects. Reward anticipation was manipulated in order to non-invasively activate dopaminergic regions of the brain. We found that memory accuracy and confidence was significantly better for reward predicting objects, while memory precision was not. This study contributes to the current literature regarding reward anticipation and its effect on memory, but more research is required.",
"The impact of reward anticipation on long-term memory precision, and how this relationship is mediated by optimism","Rooy, Magali de","['Lloyd, B.', 'Van Elk, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Episodic memory is the ability to recall personal experiences within their associated context. Reward-related brain regions are found to influence episodic memory through dopaminergic neuromodulation. In this study, we manipulated arousal in reward-related areas of the brain through inducing a state of reward anticipation, with the aim to enhance dopaminergic activity. We investigated whether reward anticipation influenced the participant’s performance in a long-term memory test. Since memory appears to not be an allor-none concept, participants were not only tested for retrieval success, but also for memory precision – the retrieval of objective details of events. Long-term memory precision is considerably understudied in light of reward anticipation. Individual differences in reward sensitivity may influence the impact of reward-related brain regions on memory. Scoring high on optimism, as a core characteristic of extraversion, involves having a sensitive reward system – potentially heightening reactivity of the dopamine system. Participants were also tested for the personality construct optimism, which we expected to enhance the effect of reward anticipation on memory precision. Our results show that the state of reward anticipation leads to enhanced accuracy and confidence in memory retrieval, measured 24h later, however not memory precision. Thus, the present study is somewhat supportive of the dopaminergic memory consolidation theory, with optimism as a possible mediator for this relationship. We propose that further research is necessary to better understand the impact of reward anticipation on the specific precision aspect of long-term memory retrieval, and how optimism traits influence this process.",
The Effects of Financial Scarcity on Working Memory Performance,"Parker, Juliet","['Hilbert, L.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Prior research has shown that diminished working memory performance might be both a consequence and cause of poverty, as it impairs the ability to make thoughtful decisions which can lead to economic choices that perpetuate poverty. In this study, we hypothesized that financial scarcity adversely affects working memory performance. We expected this effect to be stronger for sudden financial scarcity than for constant financial scarcity. In addition, we expected sudden financial abundance to alleviate the effect of financial scarcity on working memory performance. To test our hypotheses we conducted an online experiment with 187 British participants. During the experiment, participants had to manage expenses in the household task. Participants were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions, in which they experienced financial scarcity or financial abundance, the experience being either constant or sudden because of an economic shock. Subsequently, we measured their working memory performance with the online backward Corsi task. Our results do not provide evidence of adverse effects of financial scarcity on working memory performance. We discuss possible explanations for our results. We propose the null finding in this study is most likely due to our methodology.","['financial scarcity', 'economic shock', 'working memory', 'household task', 'backward Corsi task']"

Gentle dominance was operationalized as a combination of two helping motives: inclusion and superiority. We expected that participants in the stable status relationship condition would more often attribute a high-status group's request for help to a low-status group to be rooted in a gentle dominance motive compared to participants in the unstable status relationship condition, but only when the two groups had a common identity rather than separate identities. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions of a 2 (Stability: stable vs. unstable) x 2 (Identity: common identity vs. separate identities) between-subjects experimental design. Results from an online questionnaire (N = 212) did not support previous research and our predictions that both a stable status hierarchy and the presence of a common identity were attributed to the gentle dominance motive. Exploratory analyses showed that participants perceived more prosocial emotions, from the requesting high-status group to the low-status group, when the groups had a common identity. Conversely, more negative emotions were found in the separate identities condition and unstable status relations, indicating that the high-status group wants to protect their high-status position. Implications of these findings in help-seeking as the high-status group are discussed.","['help-seeking', 'group status', 'gentle dominance', 'group categorization', 'stability of status relations']"
Interindividual Differences in Exploration Behaviour and Novelty Seeking,"Bartling, Anna","['Schomacher, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Novelty has been found to motivate exploration behaviour via enhanced dopamine signalling in animals as well as humans. This has been referred to as exploration bonus or novelty bonus. The present online study compared exploration behaviour shown in a novel environment to exploration behaviour shown in a familiar environment, investigating the effect of spatial novelty on behavioural exploration. However, individuals may differ in their responsiveness to novelty and to the exploration bonus. The second aim of the study was to assess the association between exploration behaviour and interindividual differences in novelty seeking, openness and behavioural activation systems (BAS). The participants (n=23) explored two virtual environments (VEs) in a familiarisation trial in which the participants were familiarised with a VE and two exploration trials. In the exploration trials participants explored one environment that was familiar (the same VE as in the familiarisation trial) and one environment that was novel. Exploration behaviour was measured in terms of the distance the participants travelled in the VE and in terms of the number of landmarks they visited in the VE. The current study did not find a significant effect of spatial novelty on exploration behaviour (p > .05). Bayesian statistics indicated anecdotal evidence for the null hypothesis and therefore, anecdotal evidence against an association between spatial novelty and exploration behaviour. Additionally, openness and BAS were not found to be related to exploration behaviour in this study. While novelty seeking was found to be unrelated to the distance travelled in the VEs, individuals with a greater novelty seeking tendency did engage in more explorative behaviour as they visited more landmarks in the novel environment (p = .04) than individuals scoring lower on novelty seeking. In the future, it may be valuable to further elucidate the relationship between novelty seeking and exploration behaviour by investigating exploration behaviour in a naturalistic setting with a direct proxy to exploration and by including a group comparison between high novelty seekers and low novelty seekers.",

The researchers of Wessel et al. (2020), expected that compared to never-suppressed targets (baseline), participants would recall a lower percentage of targets that were to be suppressed. This suppression effect was expected to occur for cues that were part of the original study context (SP test), and for cues that were semantically related to the words in the original study context (IP test). The researchers of Wessel et al. (2020), tested this suppression effect in a multiverse analysis. They performed a dependent samples t-test on all outlier criteria and a Wilcoxon signed-rank test without the outlier criteria. A reproduction of the results found in the dependent samples t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test of Wessel et al. (2020), had been done. Then another multiverse analysis was performed, with different analytic choices than in the paper of Wessel et al.

The expectation of the study was to find a higher success rate of lower replication types: close, constructive, conceptual in lab, conceptual in field (Hüffmeier et al., 2016) and conceptual (Makel et al., 2012), in comparison to the higher replication types: exact (Hüffmeier et al., 2016) and direct (Makel et al., 2012). After an advanced search on Web of Science for articles in the psychological field published between 2000 and 2020 using the term “replicat*”, a random sample of 5000 articles was selected, that was manually coded by 14 people. The main findings showed that conceptual replications had a lower success rate than direct replications. However, the results based on the replication types in Hüffmeier et al. (2016) indicated that conceptual in lab and conceptual in field replications had the highest success rates, followed by exact replications. This demonstrated the importance of the order of studies in yielding research quality. Additionally, looking at the success rates, it can be concluded that confidence in findings can still be achieved in lower types of replication, despite of changing the methodology of the original article.",
The effect of status stability and common identity on the gentle dominance interpretation in help-seeking,"Hoeke, Niels","['Leeuwen, E. van', 'Boezeman, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Gentle dominance is a motive for a group with a relative higher status to seek help from a group with a relative lower status. It combines a desire to improve the relationship between the groups, while trying to maintain the superior position of the high-status group. This could also distract the low-status group from the status difference. We expected that in order for gentle dominance to occur, the status difference between the two groups should not be likely to change (stable) and the two groups should have to share a part of their identities (common identity). To test this, we set up an online survey in which participants read a description of a situation in which the stability and identity of a pair of high- and low-status groups was manipulated. In this scenario the high-status group had to ask for help from the low-status group. The participants (N = 212), who served as observers of this situation, had to indicate on a questionnaire to what extent different possible motives for asking for help applied to the situation. The motives were: Gentle dominance, inclusion, superiority, actual help, assistance and exploitation. For each of the six motives an ANOVA on stability and identity was carried out and no significant effects were found. We concluded that stability and identity did not have an effect on the perception of the six motives. This is possibly because participants were not directly involved in the scenario. Further research is needed on this relatively new topic.","['Gentle dominance', 'Common identity', 'Stability', 'help-seeking']"

Studies have shown trust strongly affects behavior, acceptance, attitudes and perceived usefulness of technology. Personality traits could predict the likeliness of trust in technology. In this study, we investigated the link between personality traits and self-reported trust in automated vehicles. A total of 64 participants watched first-person driving simulation videos. There were two conditions (Perfect Vehicle and Poor Vehicle), each consisting of eight phases. In each phase, a driving video was shown followed by a questionnaire about trust. In the Perfect Vehicle condition videos demonstrated perfect driving behavior and one video demonstrated reckless driving behavior in the fourth Phase. In the Poor Vehicle condition all videos demonstrated reckless driving behavior. Participants reported higher trust levels when witnessing the perfect driving behavior and lower trust levels when witnessing reckless driving behavior. There were no differences in trust levels over time in the Poor Vehicle condition. Trust levels also decreased after witnessing a critical event (reckless driving behavior) after seeing perfect driving behavior, and improved when experiencing perfect driving behavior again. Results also indicated a strong negative correlation between Neuroticism and reported trust in the Perfect Vehicle condition. The higher participants scored on the Neuroticism scale of the BFI-10, the lower trust they reported in automated vehicles. These findings suggest reckless driving behavior can cause a decrease in trust and perfect driving behavior can repair this trust again. Findings also suggest that participants with higher Neuroticism report lower trust in automated vehicles.","['Trust in automation', 'Trust in automated vehicles', 'Automation', 'Personality and automation']"

Through utilising Hirschman’s (1991) rhetoric of reaction typology, this thesis offers a new perspective on the actors and ways such strategies of rhetorical intervention are used, focussing on the case of Syria between March 2011 to July 2018. By judging the effectiveness of the perversity, futility and jeopardy theses in categorising arguments through using critical discourse analysis and content analysis, this research supports its hypothesis, identifying three key themes of opposition to R2P in line with Hirschman’s (1991) logic. This research finds that applying R2P was argued to deteriorate the Syrian situation; that it would not help; and would be detrimental to other long-standing international principles. A fourth theme was identified, which justifies resistance through supporting victim’s agency, subsequently offering an update to Hirschman’s (1991) model. This research strengthens the utility of Hirschman’s (1991) typology, offering a new way to understand arguments resisting R2P’s application and highlighting avenues to address R2P’s rhetorical opposition.",
From Loans to Grants – the EU Corona Recovery Fund and Temporary Debt-Sharing in Europe,"Ilg, Benjamin","['Macaj, G.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"As reaction to the corona crisis, EU Member states agreed in July 2020 to imple-ment a corona recovery fund, the Next Generation EU (NGEU) fund. Under its framework, the EU Commission started to take on joint debt on the financial markets and is transferring this money partly in form of grants to member states. Earlier attempts of debt-mutualization had failed due to the resistance of Northern member states. This thesis aims to answer the fol-lowing research question: Given the long-standing record of opposition to debt-sharing, why did government leaders of EU member states agree to adopt the NGEU fund? The objective was to provide an explanation why it was agreed on debt-sharing in the NGEU fund. This the-sis argues that the corona crisis can be considered a critical juncture that activated latent spill-over effects. Explaining-outcome process-tracing methods were applied in a within-case, sin-gle outcome case study.

Previous studies on trust and AVs examined several factors influencing this trust, such as mood, emotion, age and gender. However, few researchers have looked at the evolution of trust. This study explores the evolution of trust in two groups. In the Perfect Vehicle Group, participants will see a video of an AV driving without errors in 8 phases except phase 4 where they will see an AV driving with errors. In the Poor Vehicle Group, participants will see an AV driving with errors in all 8 phases. After each phase trust was measured using a self-reported questionnaire. In addition to examining the evolution of trust, the study looks at whether trust in AVs could be predicted by gender and neuroticism in the two vehicle groups. Results showed a significantly higher trust score in the Perfect Vehicle Group in comparison to the Poor Vehicle Group. When looked at within-group differences, a significant difference in trust was found in the Perfect Vehicle Group between phase 3-4 and between 4-5. This shows that the trust in the AV in the Perfect Vehicle Group dropped and later increased after watching the 4th video. In this video the AV made several errors. The Poor Vehicle Group showed no significant within group differences. Overall, the study does not show a clear evolution of trust over each phase. Furthermore, it was found that neuroticism and gender could predict trust scores. Women were found to have lower pre-test trust scores than males. Higher scores of neuroticism predicted lower trust scores.",

A Degrowth Approach to Deforestation: The Zapatista Alternative,"Faye, Na Haby Stella",['Dr. Jewellord Nem Singh'],2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Forests are fundamental environmental resources, crucial for biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and landscape resilience, and for the survival of all species on the planet. Thus, the phenomenon of deforestation has interested a number of researches, which have identified development dynamics, namely extractivist commodity crop agriculture and indigenous displacement, as its major drivers. Sustainable development (SD) is the most widely accepted approach to curb this phenomenon. However, SD projects have produced mixed results, while opportunities offered by more radical approaches, such as post-development, have been overlooked in the literature. This research takes the example of degrowth as a post-development critique and analyses the case study of the Zapatista Autonomous Communities (ZACs) in the Mexican state of Chiapas. It investigates to what extent Zapatista agricultural strategies mitigate deforestation caused by extractive commodity crop agriculture and indigenous displacement. On the basis of a triangulation of literature review, qualitative content analysis and unstructured interviews, this thesis argues that Zapatista agricultural practices represent a crucial opportunity to mitigate deforestation in Chiapas. Indeed, Zapatista price settlement mechanisms and farming practices offer an effective alternative to extractive commodity crop agriculture and, by fostering the resurgence of indigenous communities, oppose the cultural consequences of indigenous displacement.",
Should Your Group Have a Leader?

Hereby, triads of friends (n=81) or strangers (n=74) either had a powerholder with almighty decisional power, a merely appointed leader, or no leader. It was expected that different motivational orientations affect whether a powerholder is beneficial or harmful. Results from the three-person “Aloha Beach Club” group negotiation task confirmed this prediction as cooperative groups reached more integrative agreements than individualistic groups. Although it was expected that power would animate cooperative leaders to organize the negotiation, no such structuring behaviour was found. Moreover, opposite than predicted, individualistic powerholders attained higher scores in groups of friends than in groups of strangers. Overall, results showed that it is irrelevant whether leaders have almighty power or are merely appointed – in both cooperative and individualistic groups they attained similar outcomes.","['group negotation', 'power', 'asymmetric power', 'social motives']"

Due to a higher incidence of productive behaviour, making integrative behaviour more likely, prosocially motivated teams were expected to outperform individualistic teams in terms of joint outcomes. An asymmetric power dispersion was hypothesised to enhance this effect due to the either harmful or helpful effects power could have, depending on its use. Team leaders` differing power levels were expected to only have a (damaging) effect on individualistic teams´ outcomes. Trends in the data we obtained generally pointed in the predicted direction, but most effects failed to reach significance due to a lacking statistical power.

These feelings of loneliness can give rise to suicide ideation. Furthermore, research also demonstrates that high social support might weaken this association. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate if increased loneliness predicts suicide ideation among university students and if family and peer support weaken this association. 137 University students over the age of 18 partook in an online survey. To examine whether increased loneliness predicts the presence of suicide ideation, a logistic regression analysis was used. The moderating role of social support was assessed with a moderation analysis. Results indicated that increased loneliness successfully predicts the presence of suicide ideation among university students, which is in line with previous research. However, contrary to existing literature, the moderation analysis yielded nonsignificant results. This means that social support does not weaken the association between loneliness and suicide ideation. This inconsistency might be influenced by the assessment method and the moderation model used. Future research should examine the moderating role of social support in the association between loneliness and suicide ideation and the potential long-term effects the Covid-19 pandemic might have on university students’ mental health.",

In times of COVID-19, the switch to online learning, social distancing measures, and fears related to the coronavirus put a strain on students’ mental health. This study investigated whether higher COVID-19-related fears are associated with higher alcohol use in students and if study-related stress mediates this relationship. Additionally, it was predicted that students drank more because of internal motives rather than external motives during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aimed to identify points for intervention in order to prevent problem drinking in the student population. 139 responses of students from Leiden University to an online survey were analyzed. The questionnaires administered included the Alcohol Use Disorders Inventory Test 3 (AUDIT), Drinking Motives Questionnaire (DMQ), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), and Law Student Perceived Stress Scale (LSPSS). Simple linear regression analyses and a pairedsamples t-test were used to analyze the data. The results showed that neither COVID-19-related fears nor study-related stress were significant predictors of alcohol use. However, COVID-19- related fears significantly predicted study-related stress. Lastly, students were more motivated by internal than external motives to drink. Interventions should target COVID-19-related fears and study-related stress to decrease the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the academic achievement of students. Additionally, internal motives for drinking need to be targeted to decrease and/or prevent problem drinking in this population.",
"Associations between emotional abuse and suicidal attempts: The role of emotion dysregulation, former treatment, and BPD symptoms","Khosravi, Behazin","['Krause-Utz, A.', 'Tona, K.D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Every year, around 800.000 people die from suicide. Previous studies suggest that having a history of childhood maltreatment is a key predictor of suicide attempts. One in ten children go through psychological abuse, also known as emotional maltreatment. Emotional maltreatment is the most common form of childhood abuse, which often leads to difficulties in emotion regulation strategies (DERS). Moreover, a disorder that has been commonly associated with DERS is Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Suicide rates are high amongst this disorder. Therapy has been shown to improve suicidality by a great level, specifically when it was targeted at thoughts and behavior. This study focusses on the effects of childhood emotional maltreatment, BPD symptoms, former treatment and DERS on suicide attempts. In 406 participants, multiple standardized questionnaires and structured clinical interviews have been taken to investigate the effects of abuse, emotion regulation and therapy on suicide attempts. Our results show that emotional abuse influences suicide attempts in all participants, regardless of BPD symptoms. Moreover, the participants who did not have therapy, the results showed a significant relationship with suicide attempts. These findings suggest that DERS may be an important treatment target for preventing suicidal events in those with child emotional abuse.",
"De multiversele analyse in de praktijk: Uitdagingen, toepassingen en toekomst","Makkink, Ruben","['Heyman, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Op teveel punten binnen de wetenschappelijke methodologie valt verbetering te behalen. Eén van deze punten is hoe men de beschikbare data gebruikt in een onderzoek. In empirisch onderzoek wordt bij het samenstellen van een dataset een aantal arbitraire keuzes gemaakt, wat ertoe leidt dat een dataset in zekere zin actief wordt geconstrueerd. In dit onderzoek wordt toegelicht hoe deze arbitraire keuzes in de praktijk tot verschillende resultaten kunnen leiden. Dit wordt gedaan door een multiversele analyse uit te voeren op ruwe data verzameld door Vogel, Rose en Crane (2018). Bij een multiversele analyse worden meerdere analyses uitgevoerd over meerdere verwerkte datasets. Dit in tegenstelling tot klassiek onderzoek, waarbij er slechts één analyse over een dataset wordt uitgevoerd. In de betreffende multiversele analyse zijn er 124 analyses uitgevoerd. Van de hieruit voortvloeiende resulaten kwam 74,2%, 83,9% respectievelijk 93,5% overeen met het oorspronkelijke resultaat. Gevonden afwijkingen van het oorspronkelijke resultaat waren dusdanig insignificant dat de gevonden conclusies van het oorspronkelijke onderzoek niet zonder meer kunnen worden aangenomen.",
Multiverse analysis of a replication study on the sound-symbolism effect,"Rouvinen, Robert","['Heyman, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper describes a multiverse analysis and examines its use as a possible solution for the problem of researcher degrees of freedom in psychological research. Analyzing the role of arbitrary choices researchers make in their data-analysis and how it relates to the replication crisis is a central theme of this paper. The target of the current multiverse is a replication study on the sound-symbolism effect. The soundsymbolism effect refers to people associating the sound of certain (non)- words with certain shapes. This multiverse study aimed to examine what effect alternative paths of data-processing and modelling had on the findings of the replication study. The results suggest the outcome of the replication study was mostly robust to the alternative data-processing and modelling options that were proposed in this multiverse. The paper also includes a discussion on the methodology and limitations of the multiverse analysis as well as a discussion on the limitations of the target study. In addition, suggestions on future multiverse analyses, for example, combining it with a sequential testing procedure, is included.",
"A dog, a pig and a human floating in the multiverse: A Multiverse analysis exploring speciesism in children","Axioti, Sofia","['Heyman, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper’s aim was to apply the multiverse analysis method to the research paper “Children Prioritize Humans Over Animals Less Than Adults Do” by Wilks et al., (2021). The research hypothesis of the latter paper was that children exhibit the tendency of preferring humans over animals less than adults. This preference refers to the bias that adults usually show when they are faced with an ethical dilemma which requires them to save either a person or an animal. After administering a series of ethical dilemmas to children and adults, a regression analysis indicated that children exhibited less speciesist behavior than adults. The multiverse analysis is a method that allows to check for the robustness of a found effect by comparing it with other results, which are products of the same dataset. As part of the multiverse analysis in question, different alternatives concerning data-processing and -analysis were explored and a matrix of different paths was created. This procedure resulted in 18 new regression analyses, which also indicated that children show less humans-over-animals bias. In addition to the main hypothesis, some exploratory analyses recorded in the original paper and including other variables aside from age were further explored. Finally, the topic of multiverse analysis was discussed extensively and further extensions of the current multiverse were proposed.",
The Added Value of a Multiverse Analysis: Revisiting a Study about Feelings of Disgust Felt Towards Gay Men,"Rozendaal, Fabian","['Heyman, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In recent times, many researchers have introduced research methods to help increase transparency in quantitative social science. One of the introduced research methods is performing a multiverse analysis, which consists of exploring different pathways in data processing with the same statistical method. By doing this, the robustness of statistical results against data processing choices can be checked. In this essay, a multiverse analysis will be performed to test the robustness of statistical results for two hypotheses from a study measuring feelings of disgust towards male homosexuality. The goal of the performed multiverse analysis is to find out how it can provide more insight into an existing dataset. In the original study, the statistical results for both hypotheses were found to be significant, performing a reproduction of statistical results only shows one out of two to be significant. Furthermore, the majority of statistical results found while following alternative pathways turn out to be non-significant. Conclusively, the presented statistical results could be considered not robust against alternative data processing choices. The new insights provided by the performed multiverse analysis could help make a case for multiverse analyses becoming the norm for researchers.",
"Using multiverse analysis to examine the robustness of a non-significant effect: Transparency, openness and reproducibility as fundamental features of science","Visser, Emise","['Heyman, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The science of psychology is facing a so-called replication and reproduction crisis. This crisis calls for increased transparency in the way that statistics are reported, in order to make findings in psychology more reliable, more likely to be interpreted correctly, and easier to verify and replicate. Undisclosed flexibility in data collection and analysis can severely inflate the false positive rate in psychology (and other disciplines). This issue can be tackled by performing a multiverse analysis. Recent literature proposes that this method guarantees an unprecedent level of transparency for research papers. Building on this stream of research, the present thesis examines the value of using a multiverse analysis to examine the robustness of a non-significant effect. Multiverse analysis refers to a method which involves performing the analysis of interest across the complete set of data sets that arise from several defensible data processing and analysis choices. The demonstration of the multiverse focuses on data collected by Dieleman et al. (2020). The reported results were first reproduced using the R software environment, and then, alternative analysis pathways were examined. The results proved to be reproducible, yet alternative pathways revealed some fluctuation. This thesis contributes to a better understanding of how a multiverse analysis can improve the transparency of psychological science.","['replication and reproduction crisis', 'undisclosed flexibility', 'false-positive psychology', 'multiverse analysis', 'transparency', 'robustness', 'data processing and analysis', 'psychological science']"
Exploring the Robustness of Significant Findings with a Multiverse Analysis: Assessing whether hand position really affects performance on multiplication tasks,"Cavelier Ibelings, Valeria","['Heyman, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"With this study we hope to shed light onto the fragility or robustness of significant psychological findings. When researchers have so many degrees of freedom, ways to transform and manipulate their raw data, this not always leads to the sincerest results, even when done unintentionally. With a growing effort to deal with the flaws of psychological research methods, performing multiverse analyses is a way to deal with the numerous analytical and sometimes arbitrary decisions researchers must take when processing their raw data. A multiverse data analysis entails listing all the possible data processing pathways a researcher can take, and running the same analysis for each of these pathways. This results in a wide range of p-values that can be compared to determine the robustness of the claimed results. In this study, we use the data collected by Davoli, O’Rear, McAulay, McNeil, and Brockmole (2020), for their study on how hand position affects performance on multiplication tasks. In their article, Davoli and his colleagues (2020) claim that placing one’s hands close to the study and test materials hinders performance on multiplication tasks (in terms of reaction times), but only when using the same format as in the study phase. When the same format is used, however, there is no effect. The data processing alternatives include using different outlier criteria for reaction times, logarithmically transforming the data and using accuracy of answers as a covariate, among others. Using a multiverse analysis, we were able to uncover the most influential pathways, determine which combination of choices yielded the best and worse results, and question the authenticity of the data processing pathway implemented by the researchers.",

Het fenomeen dat erachter schuilt is oneerlijkheid. Een populaire manier om oneerlijkheid te meten is de matrix taak. De opdracht van de matrix taak bestaat uit het omcirkelen van twee getallen in een matrix die samen tien maken. Met het aantal goede antwoorden kunnen ze geld verdienen. De participanten krijgen de kans om te liegen over hoeveel matrices ze correct hebben opgelost. Door te liegen en een hoger aantal goede antwoorden door te geven, kan er meer geld worden verkregen. Het aantal correct opgeloste matrices kan worden vergeleken met het aantal matrices dat door de deelnemers wordt opgegeven om de mate van valsspelen te schatten. De matrix taak houdt alleen geen rekening met eerlijke fouten en gaat ervan uit dat mensen goed kunnen optellen. Hierdoor is de matrix taak onbetrouwbaar. In het onderzoek van Heyman et al.

In deze studie werden echter verschillende participanten uit de analyse gehaald omdat ze hadden geantwoord dat ze al eerder van het onderzoek hadden gehoord of gelezen, evenals participanten die deze vraag hadden opengelaten. Daarnaast werd er in het onderzoek geen rekening gehouden met sekse. Deze variabelen kunnen ervoor zorgen dat het onderzoek niet robuust is. Om dit te onderzoeken werd in deze scriptie een multiverse analyse uitgevoerd. Hierin werd er gekeken naar 16 verschillende analyses.

A Bias towards Threat? The Relation between Social Anxiety and Attention towards Emotions,"Becker, Sophia","['Folz, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Models on social anxiety disorder, such as the Cognitive Behavioral Model by Rapee and Heimberg (1997) suggested that maladaptive attentional processes are strongly involved in the disorder’s etiology and maintenance. The current study aimed to build upon recent findings in highly socially anxious individuals by testing a non-clinical population for a positive relation between the attentional bias towards angry faces and social anxiety trait levels. Additionally, attentional biases to other emotional facial expressions (i.e., angry, happy, sad, and fearful) were explored for their relationship with social anxiety trait levels, as was the influence of context on the relationship between the attentional bias towards angry faces and social anxiety trait levels. 104 healthy participants completed the dot-probe task showing an emotional facial expression. This was done in in two natural settings (Apenheul or Night of Discoveries) and one lab setting. Results indicated a marginal significant trend of individuals with higher social anxiety trait levels also presenting stronger attentional biases towards angry faces. The additional exploratory investigations yielded no significant results. Based on the current results it was concluded that the relation between the attentional bias towards threat and social anxiety levels, which is quite consistently found in individuals with clinical levels of social anxiety, existed also in a weaker form in a healthy population, and might increase with higher social anxiety trait scores. This provides insight on how attentional biases might affect the general population’s behavior and how a potentially beneficial evolutionary function can turn dysfunctional in socially anxious individuals.","['dot-probe task', 'emotional facial expressions', 'social anxiety', 'attentional bias']"
Gender impact on mimicry evaluation,"Rednika, Liza","['Fasya, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Mimicry facilitates social bonding and increases the feelings of affiliation and liking. However, not every individual perceives mimicry in the same way. Previous research showed that there are consistent differences among various groups. Nevertheless, previous studies failed to establish whether gender can also play a role in evaluating explicit mimicry. Unlike the previous studies, the focus of this research is implicit mimicry. Since mimicry does not always occur on explicit level, investigating mimicry that occurs on implicit level, such as pupil dilation mimicry, might lead to a different result. In this study, the aim is to investigate whether gender has an influence on the evaluation of avatars which mimic or does not mimic the participants pupil dilation. For the purposes of this study, avatar is defined as an artificial intelligence figure representing a real person. To test the effect of gender on mimicry, 19 females and 10 males interacted with 6 avatars. 3 of them mimicked the participant’s pupil dilation while the other 3 avatars did not. Afterwards, participants evaluated how much they liked the avatar and how much they would like to meet the speaker in real life. Overall, female participants evaluated both mimicking and non-mimicking avatars more negatively than the male participants. However, female participants reported a higher desire for the future interaction with non-mimicking avatars in comparison to males. The study did not yield a significant result. However, the difference between genders in mimicry evaluation was still observed.","['Mimicry', 'pupil dilation', 'gender']"

Social Anxiety and the Evaluation of Autonomic Mimicry: A Virtual Reality Study,"Pieperhoff, Leo","['Fasya, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Mimicry is the replication of another person’s behaviour and/or physiological state in short temporal succession of the original behaviour. It can be differentiated into autonomic mimicry and motor mimicry, with the former denoting mimicry of autonomic nervous system activity such as heart rate, with visible behaviours such as blushing or pupil dilation, whereas motor mimicry is any mimicry of motor movements. Together, these two types of autonomic mimicry result in emotional mimicry, also called emotional contagion. The primary aspect of emotional mimicry is reciprocal evaluation, as people with positive affiliation towards each other exhibit it the most. However, socially anxious people have deficiencies in motor mimicry and do not prefer a mimicking partner. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether highly socially anxious people would evaluate virtual characters exhibiting autonomic mimicry less positively than low socially anxious individuals. Within the study, 29 people with different levels of social anxiety were exposed to autonomic mimicry through pupil dilation by three virtual characters telling three different stories, whilst three others told stories without mimicking the participants, but still exhibiting occasional pupil dilation. Comfortability around the characters was measured through the desire for future interaction scale, and liking through an avatar evaluation questionnaire. Two repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) and two mixed ANOVA were conducted and yielded no significant differences in evaluation between the mimicry conditions, nor any significant mediation of these differences by the social anxiety group, suggesting that differences in peoples’ evaluations of mimicry are primarily reserved to motor mimicry.","['Social anxiety', 'evaluation', 'pupil size', 'pupil dilation', 'autonomic mimicry', 'pupil-mimicry', 'virtual reality', 'VR', 'virtual characters']"
Does Social Anxiety Modulate the Link between Autistic Traits and Attention Towards Threat/Angry Facial Expressions?,"Wójcik, Julia","['Folz, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social anxiety (SA) is found to be highly co-prevalent for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Both are characterized by attentional abnormalities in emotional processing. Previous research has shown a significant bias towards angry faces for individuals in both groups. This study aims to investigate the co-prevalence between SA and ASD traits in a non-clinical sample, and how these trait dimensions relate to an attentional bias (AB) towards angry faces. We want to investigate whether SA traits moderate the relationship between ASD traits and the AB towards threatening stimuli. A dot-probe paradigm and self-report questionnaires were used. The results suggest an overlap of characteristics of SA and ASD on trait levels in a non-clinical population. There was significant bias towards angry faces independent of SA and ASD traits. No significant link between the SA and ASD traits and the attentional bias was found and the relationship between ASD traits and the AB towards angry faces was independent of SA trait scores. These results could indicate that in comparison to clinical groups, individuals at lower levels of SA are able to regulate the attentional bias more easily or that the emotional processing for individuals with ASD traits does not reach the hypo- or hyper-arousal. We suggest further exploration of the AB at various points of the spectrum for SA, as well as for clinical groups with ASD. We recommend further investigation on the difference between the AB and disengagement index, in line with recent literature on SA.","['attentional bias', 'social anxiety', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'dot-probe']"
Dot-probe task to investigate gender and age-related attentional biases towards happy and angry faces,"Luukkonen, Ainomaria","['Folz, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"How humans attend to emotional stimuli has been extensively researched. Previous studies have found that there are individual differences in attentional preference towards emotional stimuli. For example, some individuals attend more towards positive information, whereas some towards negative stimuli. Individual’s anxiety level has often been linked to cause attentional preference towards threatening stimuli. Less is known about the other possible factors modulating attentional processing of emotional stimuli. Socioemotional Selectivity theory presents that with age adult start to prefer activities and information that is meaningful and positive and avoid things that are negative. The theory also implies that younger people are often more drawn to negative aspects in their life. Thus, this study aimed to investigate, whether this age-related preference towards emotional stimuli is also seen in attentional functions. Moreover, some preliminary studies have found there to be gender differences in how humans attend to emotional stimuli. Thus, the study aimed to bring more clarity to the possible gender-related attentional preference towards emotions. To test this the participants (N = 102, males = 29, women = 73) completed a dot-probe task. The dot-probe task allows to calculate how much attention individual showed on certain type of facial expressions. The study found that age was non-significant predictor of attentional processes toward angry and happy faces. Moreover, no gender differences were found on attentional bias towards happy faces, but small directional evidence for women allocating more attention to angry faces than men. These findings imply that age and gender are not strong predictors for attentional preferences towards emotions.","['gender', 'age', 'emotional faces', 'attention bias', 'dot probe task']"
Acceptability of Placebo & Counterconditioning treatment in different disease symptoms for healthy participants,"Heyns, Cathy","['Lennep, H. van + Vliet, M. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"A placebo treatment and counterconditioning treatment are increasingly common in clinical setting. The choice for a placebo treatment or counterconditioning treatment may make a treatment with an active agent unnecessary, which may lead to beneficial outcomes for the condition of the patient because of the decrease in sideeffects. Nonetheless, there are a lot of ethical issues against the use of placebo treatment and counterconditioning treatment (e.g., endangers the patient’s autonomy, damages the trust of the patient in clinician and in the health care system). In previous research it seemed that there was a difference in the acceptability between different symptom groups. In this study this was further investigated by looking at the acceptability of placebo treatment and counterconditioning treatment in three different symptom groups: psychological symptoms, acute pain symptoms and chronic pain symptoms. In this study, fifty-eight healthy respondents between the age of 18 and 74 filled in a survey about the acceptability of placebo treatment and counterconditioning treatment. It was found that overall, there seemed to be less acceptability of placebo treatment towards acute pain symptoms in comparison to chronic pain symptoms (p = .025) and psychological symptoms (p = .003). It was also found that there seemed to be more acceptability of counterconditioning treatment towards psychological symptoms in comparison to acute pain symptoms (p < .001) and chronic pain symptoms (p = .053).

The Role of Context on Expected Treatment Outcome: A questionnaire study on which contextual factor influences perceived positive treatment outcome in fibromyalgia patients the most.,"Picus, Danchelo","['Lennep, H. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Patients receiving medical treatments from health practitioners, are not only influenced by the treatments itself, but also by the context surrounding the treatment. This context is also known as contextual factors (CFs). In this study the role of CFs was examined, specifically to see which positive CFs (e.g. good doctor patient communication) fibromyalgia patients think plays the biggest role in treatment outcome. Fibromyalgia (FM) is a prevalent and disabling disorder characterized by widespread pain and symptoms such as stress, fatigue and depression. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 32 patients diagnosed with FM passed the screening to participate. A sub study of a bigger research project was used. This sub study was a questionnaire on 15 positive CFs. The positive CFs were measured on a scale of 0 to 10. 0 being that the positive CF has no influence on treatment outcome, 10 being that the positive CF fully determines the treatment outcome. The variables were investigated by using frequencies which gave information on the characteristics of variables such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation and minimal and maximal values. Results: Comparing the mean of the positive CFs showed that physical contact with the patient had the highest mean of 7.29 (SD=2.01) with a mode of 8 and minimum of 2 and maximum of 10. Conclusion: Findings provide evidence that physical contact with the patient is a positive CF to be optimized when it comes to fibromyalgia. Future research is needed to verify these findings.",

Ervaringen van patiënten kunnen deze verwachting vormgeven, waardoor de patiënt-arts relatie belangrijk is. In deze cross-sectionele vragenlijststudie werd onderzocht of het vertrouwen van gezonde en fibromyalgische respondenten in artsen hun waargenomen placeboeffectiviteit beïnvloedt, en of fibromyalgie deze relatie beïnvloedde. Er werd ook nagegaan of mannen en vrouwen verschillen in hun vertrouwen in hun arts. Een online vragenlijst werd gebruikt waarmee 73 respondenten zijn geworven. Een enkelvoudige lineaire regressieanalyse werd gebruikt voor de eerste onderzoeksvraag en onafhankelijke t-toetsen werden gebruikt voor de overige onderzoeksvragen.

Evolution of Trust in Automated Cars,"Nouweland, Michiel van den","['Fasya, E.', 'Walker, F.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Studies show numerous benefits of implementing automated cars on public roads. For people to use automated cars, trust levels have to be sufficient. In order to manage users’ trust in automated vehicles optimally, it is important to understand how trust works. Firstly, this paper provides background information on automated cars and trust. Thereafter, we explore how self-reported trust evolves in drivers experiencing one-off poor vehicle behaviour in an otherwise reliable vehicle (Perfect Vehicle condition), compared to drivers who experienced consistent yet unreliable behaviour (Poor Vehicle condition). This was done by showing participants 8 videos (phases) in each condition and measuring self-reported trust. Importantly, trust recovery after one-off poor behaviour in the Perfect Vehicle condition is researched. Furthermore, the correlation between driving experience and trust is studied. Results indicate that, in the Perfect Vehicle condition, self-reported trust drops significantly after the one-off poor vehicle behaviour. Afterwards, self-reported trust levels recovered completely and immediately in subsequent Phases. Additionally, trust levels did never change throughout all Phases in the Poor Vehicle condition. Finally, we found no correlation between driving experience and self-reported trust levels. Overall the findings suggest no strong trust developments over time, regardless of vehicle condition.",

As the need for action is becoming more important than ever, we need to understand what factors can help increase implementation and reduce infringements of environmental policies. There is particular lack of research on the potential relationship between public concern about climate change and the infringements of European Union environmental rules in Europe. As respect of common rules is key to maintain the stability of the European Union, infringements represent a certain risk of conflict. Therefore, this research also helps fill the literature gap in the conflict and climate nexus about climate conflict in Europe. For these purposes, this research paper explores how public concern for climate change might impact the number of infringements member states commit regarding environmental policies of the European Union. Through a OLS regression analysis, the research finds that public concern does not seem to have a significant impact on the number of infringements member states commit. This apparent absence of influence of public opinion raises serious concerns as to the people’s power to make their governments listen to them and their calls for environmental protection.","['public opinion', 'climate change', 'European Union', 'infringement', 'environmental regulations']"
Legitimacy of armed groups: A gendered perspective on the Women’s Protection Units,"Pol, Charlotte van de",['Dr. Jentzsch'],2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the last decade, the participation of women in political violence has received an increasing amount of academic attention. However, scholars often neglected to find empirical evidence on the implications of women for armed groups perceived legitimacy. To fill this gap, this thesis explores the Women’s Protection Unit, which received worldwide media attention in their battle against the Islamic State, as a single case study. This thesis examines the Western perspective towards these women combatants by employing a qualitative content analysis of 43 Dutch newspaper articles. The results reveal that the media uses stereotypes about gender by framing these women combatants as non-aggressive, weaker, and less threatening than the male combatants of the Islamic State. As a result, the media legitimizes the use of violence of the female combatants as they need to protect themselves. Besides, the media glorifies the women of the YPJ by pointing out their fight for Western values, namely equality. Consequently, this thesis posits that the way the media frame the women combatants and their opponent, the Islamic State, favours the legitimacy of the armed group, the Women’s Protection Unit.","['Kurds', 'YPJ', 'women combatants', 'legitimacy', 'media framing', 'civil war', 'violence', 'gender']"

The relationship between Chinese development projects and human rights in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Tulp, Henriëtte","['Meijerink, F.', 'RezaeeDaryakenari, B.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"China is granting billion-dollar loans to African countries to build large development projects, mainly for extracting natural resources and building infrastructure. These loans are different from the loans from the Global North, in a sense that they are unconditional and do not require certain democratic or human rights standards. However, the implications of this unconditionality remain largely unexplored. In this paper, the relationship between human rights scores and the number of projects an African country receives from China is investigated for the period 2001-2007. Furthermore, the effect of voting alignment with China on this association is examined. So far, most research on China-Africa relations, and more specifically, research relating to how China impacts human rights situations in Africa, is done in a qualitative manner. However, this research borrows from several other related works and merges them into one theory that is tested in a quantitative manner. Linear, logistic, and negative binomial regressions are used to test the hypotheses. Furthermore, a mediation analysis is conducted to estimate the impact of voting alignment on the aforementioned association. The results show a negative and significant relationship between human rights score and the number of projects a country receives from China. Thus, it is important for African people and the international community to be aware of the potential risks of these Chinese-funded projects. Furthermore, the functioning of the conditional loans of the Global North might be undermined by the unconditional loans from China. Therefore, a careful re-examination of these loans is necessary to prevent any counterproductive effects.",

Werkt angst belemmerend om te leren door feedback?

Angst kan invloed hebben op cognitieve prestaties, zoals leren, waarbij feedback een essentieel onderdeel is. Daarnaast is het mogelijk dat het observeren van een individu de prestaties negatief beïnvloed, ook wel het publiek effect. Het is van belang om de relatie tussen angstgevoelens en het leren aan de hand van feedback, wat mogelijk beïnvloed wordt door observatie, te onderzoeken om de meest optimale situatie te creëren om de beste prestaties tot uiting te laten komen. Aan het onderzoek hebben 79 participanten deelgenomen. Het onderzoek bestaat uit de angstvragenlijst, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), en een probabilistische leertaak, waarbij gekeken is naar de accuraatheid. Het onderzoek beantwoordt de vraag wat de relatie is tussen de hoogte van angstgevoelens en de accuraatheid op de probabilistische leertaak. Wanneer er hoger gescoord wordt op de STAI wordt er minder accuraat gescoord op de taak. Wanneer er meer angstgevoelens aanwezig zijn wordt er minder accuraat geleerd aan de hand van feedback. Met de tweede onderzoeksvraag onderzoeken we wat de relatie is tussen hoogte van angstgevoelens op accuraatheid van de probabilistische leertaak wanneer een individu geobserveerd wordt vergeleken geen observatie. De hoogte van angstgevoelens heeft geen extra invloed op de accuraatheid wanneer een individu geobserveerd wordt.

The influence of daytime-camera versus nighttime-camera recordings on the judgement in guilt of criminal trials,"Reeven, Sem van","['Van Dillen, L.', 'Van Bommel, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Wrongful convictions in lawsuits are mainly caused by human biases. Yet, little empirical research focuses on brightness biases in video evidence. The aim of this study is to investigate the difference between day and night-time camera evidence on the estimated likelihood of guilt and actual guilt assessment of a suspect, in criminal trials. It also investigates the effect a bias warning has, and whether the difference between day and nighttime camera evidence on the estimated likelihood of guilt is mediated by people’s perceptions of danger and safety. A total of 197 respondents participated in an online survey. A 2 (evidence type: video daytime or video nighttime) x 2 (bias warning: absent or present) between-subjects design was used in the survey, where the participants were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. After reading an introductory text and watching the video evidence that matched their condition, the participants were given questions about the dependent variables and mediators. Our research demonstrates that camera evidence that is recorded during night, results in a higher likelihood of guilt and a higher number of guilty judgements, in comparison to camera evidence that is recorded during daytime. This relationship is mediated by the perception of danger and safety: nighttime camera evidence results in a higher perception of danger and a lower perception of safety, which in turn results in a higher likelihood of guilt. Only the likelihood of guilt was considered for the mediation. Moreover, a bias warning did not have an effect on the difference between day and night camera evidence, and thus did not lead to reduced scores on the estimated likelihood and judgements of guilt. The findings of this research suggest that judges must be aware that nighttime camera evidence can increase their perception of the likelihood of a suspect’s guilt. It is important to take this into account when using video evidence in court. Further research should more closely examine the links between a bias warning and the likelihood of a suspect’s guilt. This aims to minimize the bias between day versus night-time camera evidence on the estimated likelihood of guilt and actual guilt assessment of a suspect.",

Waar voor je geld: Waardegedreven zorg en de betrouwbaarheid van indicatoren voor de meting van kwaliteit van behandeling van Post Traumatische Stress Stoornis,"Spaans, Tim","['Beurs, E. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"The aim of this research was to test the test-retest reliability of two new indicators for quality of health care and compare these indicators with an indicator based on outcome of healthcare that has already been found reliable. These new indicators are based on the ratio between outcome and costs of treatment and the ratio between outcome and duration in days of treatment. The reliability of the three indicators is assessed with the Intra Class Correlation coefficient from data (N = 633) of a division of a mental health care institution specialized in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Outcome of the treatment was assessed with a pre- and posttest measurement of the severity of complaints, as measured with the symptomatic distress subscale of the Outcome Questionnaire 45.2. The reliability of the original indicator, based solely on outcome, was good (ICC = 0.613). The reliability of the indicator based on outcome and duration of treatment was fair (ICC = 0.549) and the reliability of the indicator based on outcome and costs was poor (ICC = 0.088). Presumably, these lower ICC values on the enriched indicators are a result of instability over time of the cost and duration components of the indicators in combination with a disproportionate increase of costs and days of treatment in comparison with outcome of treatment. The research suffered from low statistical power and this precludes definite conclusions about the statistical significance of differences in reliability among the indicators. For a better comparison of the test-retest reliability between the indicators with a statistical test, replication of this research with a larger set of evaluable treatments is necessary.",
Providing valuable care: Assessing a new indicator for the quality of mental healthcare in the Netherlands,"Scheltinga, Tanner","['Beurs, E. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Current mental health care systems evaluate the quality of care mainly based on the outcome of treatment. However, for patients, the time spent to achieve this outcome is a relevant factor which is often overlooked in modern health care systems. For insurance providers, the incurred cost of treatment is an important criterion for quality of mental health care. In order to offer truly valuable care in the eyes of both of these parties, the result of treatment must measure up to its required effort, both temporal and financial. Including cost and duration in the evaluation of health care will ultimately benefit all parties involved. Therefore, the present study tests the validity of two new quality indicators based on the principle of value-based health care. Value here is defined as outcome relative to cost or outcome relative to duration. Data used was collected by Routine Outcome Monitoring at several outpatient clinics providing specialized mental health care in the Netherlands. MANOVA testing revealed that the two new quality indicators showed larger differences in quality of care than outcome alone. These results were supported by differences among clinics in the cost and duration of treatment per improved and recovered patient. Based on the results of this study, the use of quality indicators of value-based health care over outcome alone in the mental health care sector is advised.",
Waarde gedreven zorg bij persoonlijkheidsstoornissen: De test-hertestbetrouwbaarheid van diverse indicatoren voor het meten van de kwaliteit van zorg,"Geveke, Willem","['Beurs, E. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De huidige financiering van zorg stimuleert eerder tot het verlenen van meer zorg dan tot betere zorg. Bij het streven naar de best mogelijke zorg, zijn goede indicatoren nodig om de kwaliteit te meten. Het doel van dit onderzoek is het bepalen en vergelijken van de testhertestbetrouwbaarheid van drie indicatoren voor het meten van kwaliteit van zorg bij persoonlijkheidsstoornissen: de uitkomst van de behandeling en twee nieuwe indicatoren: de uitkomst in verhouding tot kosten en tot duur. De gegevens zijn aangeleverd door het Nederlands Psychoanalytisch Instituut, onderdeel van Arkin. De test-hertestbetrouwbaarheid van de indicatoren is bepaald middels de Intraclass Correlatie Coëfficiënt (ICC) en is berekend door herhaalde verstelling van de kwaliteit bij 14 groepen die zijn gekozen op basis van locatie, het niveau van functioneren en pre-test ernstniveau. De betrouwbaarheid van de behandeluitkomst indicator ICC = ,494, de kostenindicator ICC = ,516 en duurindicator ICC = ,480. De ICC’s van de indicatoren verschilden niet significant van elkaar, vanwege de grote betrouwbaarheidsintervallen van de drie indicatoren, die onderling een aanzienlijke overlap vertoonden. Het verrijken van de uitkomst indicator met een kosten of een duur component hebben niet tot statisch significant betrouwbaardere indicatoren geleid. Vanwege het geringe aantal groepen waar kwaliteit van zorg bij kon worden vastgesteld was er onvoldoende statistische power voor een redelijke kans op het vinden van een significant verschil in betrouwbaarheid tussen de indicatoren. Vervolgonderzoek met meer evalueerbare behandelingen is nodig om te bepalen of het verrijken van de behandeluitkomst indicator tot een betrouwbaardere indicator leidt.",
Waarde gedreven zorg binnen de Geestelijke Gezondheidszorg: De ontwikkeling van nieuwe indicatoren voor een verbeterde evaluatie van kwaliteit binnen de basis GGZ,"Schmidt, Roos","['Beurs, E. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Een veelgebruikte indicator van kwaliteit van zorg is de uitkomst van de behandeling. Dit geld ook zo in de GGZ. Afname van psychische klachten of verbeteren van functioneren, is ook het doel waarvoor cliënten in behandeling komen. Het is belangrijk voor de cliënt dat klachten zo snel mogelijk verminderen, en er zo snel mogelijk resultaat te zien is van de behandeling. Snel herstel impliceert gewonnen levensgeluk. Daarnaast zijn voor de financiers (zorgverzekeraar en de overheid) de kosten van een behandeling een belangrijk aspect van de kwaliteit van de zorg. Vanuit de waarde gedreven zorg beweging is er dan ook voor gepleit naast uitkomst ook de gepleegde inspanning en kosten op te nemen in de kwaliteitsindicator. Door de variabelen duur en kosten te betrekken in een indicator zou er een veel vollediger beeld van de kwaliteit van zorg ontstaan. Deze stelling wordt in dit onderzoek onderzocht: of de kwaliteitsindicatoren duur-efficiëntie en kosten-efficiëntie valide zijn. Duur-efficiëntie wordt hier gedefinieerd als uitkomst gedeeld door duur; kosten-efficiëntie als uitkomst gedeeld door kosten. De kwaliteitsindicatoren zijn valide wanneer ze duidelijker verschil aantonen tussen natuurlijke groepen cliënten die op verschillende locaties van een GGZ instelling zijn behandeld dan uitkomst alleen. Er is data gebruikt van de instelling Arkin in Amsterdam. MANOVA testen lieten zien dat door het toevoegen van kwaliteitsindicatoren er een groter verschil wordt gezien tussen de groepen. Uit de MANOVA bleek dat zowel de indicator gebaseerd op uitkomst alleen als de indicator voor kosten-efficiëntie onderscheid significant maakte tussen de diverse groepen; de groepen verschilden niet op de indicator voor duur-efficiëntie. Vervolgonderzoek is nodig, met betere indeling in te vergelijken groepen, om na te gaan of de toevoegingen van duur en kosten aan de kwaliteitsindicatoren tot betere indicatoren leidt.",

Dit onderzoek richt zich op het vergelijken van de betrouwbaarheid van een kwaliteitsindicator op basis van behandeluitkomst met twee nieuwe kwaliteitsindicatoren; behandeluitkomst gedeeld door kosten en behandeluitkomst gedeeld door duur. Uitkomstgegevens van patiënten met een depressie of angststoornis van de organisatie PuntP zijn gebruikt.

Uit de resultaten bleek dat de hoogste betrouwbaarheid werd gevonden bij de uitkomstindicator (ICC = .466); de duurindicator (ICC = .230) en de kostenindicator (ICC = .112) hadden een lagere test-hertest betrouwbaarheid. De betrouwbaarheidsindicatoren verschillen onderling niet significant van elkaar aangezien de betrouwbaarheidsintervallen overlappen. Oorzaak hiervan zou de aanzienlijke kans op een Type II fout kunnen zijn, vanwege een lage statistische power.

"Psychiatric disorders and symptoms in female adolescents suffering from anorexia nervosa: (Severity of) depression, anxiety and obsession and compulsion (over time) in female adolescents with anorexia nervosa compared to healthy controls","Kelder, Lois op de","['Klaassens, B.', 'Van der Hiele, K.', 'Dieleman, G.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by disturbed self-image resulting in dieting and losing weight. AN can be subdivided into the restricting (AN-r) and the binge-eating/purging type (AN-bp). The comorbidity of psychiatric disorders in AN is high. Previous literature mainly focused on comorbidity in AN adults whereas the onset of AN is often during adolescence. Our study investigated (severity of) depression, anxiety (social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in AN female adolescents and subtypes and differences in these symptoms at baseline and after one year follow-up. Methods: The current study is the largest longitudinal, first-onset AN, case-control study in the Netherlands (N=121) with identical procedures at baseline and follow-up. The study included 56 AN and 65 healthy control (HC) female adolescents aged between 12 and 22 years. AN adolescents received treatment as usual between baseline and follow-up. The MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used to examine the presence of psychiatric disorders. The Beck Depression InventoryII, the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders and the (Children’s) Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale measured severity of depressive, anxiety and obsessive and compulsive symptoms respectively. Group differences in prevalence and severity of psychiatric disorders were examined using chi-square tests and a MANCOVA test respectively. Changes over time were investigated using a one-way repeated measures ANCOVA. Results: The Pearson chi-square (χ 2 (1, n = 92) = 17.47, p ≤ .001) and Fisher’s exact test (χ 2 (1, n = 67) = 7.05, p = .011) showed higher prevalence of depression and social phobia respectively at baseline in AN (41% and 14%) compared to HCs (14% and 2%). There were no differences at baseline in prevalence of GAD and OCD between the groups. The Fisher’s exact test showed no differences in prevalence of the aforementioned psychiatric disorders between AN-bp and AN-r. The Pillai’s Trace test (F(3,46) = 20.73, p = .000, Pillia’s trace = .58, partial eta squared = .58) showed more severe depressive, anxiety and obsessive and compulsive symptoms at baseline in AN compared to HCs. Lastly, the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Test showed no differences in AN in the aforementioned symptoms over time. Conclusion: Depression, social phobia and depressive, anxiety and obsessive and compulsive symptoms were more prevalent at baseline in AN adolescents compared to HCs. Research into comorbidity in subtypes of AN adolescents is needed since our study included a small subtype sample size. Moreover, treatment should focus on reducing the prevalence of social phobia and depression and severity of depressive symptoms.","['Anorexia nervosa', 'restrictive subtype', 'binge-purging subtype', 'depression', 'generalized anxiety disorder', 'social phobia', 'obsessive-compulsive disorder']"

De Unie lijdt aan wat een democratisch tekort wordt genoemd: een gebrek aan democratische legitimiteit. Over een geschikte oplossing voor het democratisch tekort wordt al lange tijd gediscussieerd. Een van de geopperde oplossingen is de oprichting van transnationale partij. In het onderhavige onderzoek wordt gekeken in hoeverre een transnationale partij bij kan dragen aan de oplossing van het democratisch tekort van de Europese Unie. Ter beantwoording van deze vraag is een case-studie uitgevoerd naar de eerste pan-Europese partij: Volt. De ideologische en institutionele standpunten van deze partij zijn geanalyseerd en binnen een theoretisch kader geplaatst. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat Volt streeft naar een standaardisering op het gebied van voertaal en inrichting van het politiek bestel van de EU, die kan leiden tot een vergroting van de kloof tussen de Europese Unie en de burger. Wel is de komst van Volt als pan-Europese partij een stap in de richting van een politieke gemeenschap op Europees niveau.",

Rrustemi'],2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The goal of this research is to study the relationship between oil, water, and conflict in the context of the theory of globalised hydrocarbon assemblages by performing a case study in the Niger Delta in Nigeria. Globalised hydrocarbon assemblages theory criticises the resource thesis, which argues that the state is the main actor in influencing the relationship between oil water and conflict. Globalised hydrocarbon assemblages theory argues that there is a network of different actors active in influencing and shaping this relationship. It suggests that the interaction between internal and actors within a network is vital to comprehend the relationship between oil, water, and conflict. First, a literature study finds that oil pollution and extraction of oil have put stress on the water resources in the Niger Delta. As a result, water security is not achieved, which leads to conflict over water. Next to oil, conflict and weak state institutions also affect water insecurity. Second, qualitative content analysis is conducted to provide a nuanced perspective on the presence of actors, the impact actors have on the relationship, the interaction between actors, and actor strength. The results show that TOCs are the dominant actor within the network with the power to shape and control the behaviour of the state, youths, militants groups, elites, and communities. Their dominance has the strongest impact on the relation between oil, water, and conflict. The findings of the analysis refute the resource curse thesis that the state is the dominant actor and ingrained in one exclusive space. The thesis contributes to the theory of globalised hydrocarbon assemblages as an improved explanation for actor dynamics.",

However, the country is far from achieving peace and prosperity. Despite the official Intra-Afghan peace process starting in 2020, violant outbursts between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (i.e. Taliban) keep the country in paralysis. Interestingly, the Afghanistan is considered the watertower of the region with large water quantities flowing through thousands of streams and rivers of the three major river basins: Panj-Amu, Kabul, and Helamnd. Therefore, this thesis will assess what role of joint water management can have on the peace process between the two internal waring factions. To do so a process tracing analysis is conducted which is based on Dresse et al. (2018) environmental peacebuilding framework. The analysis then focuses on the three major Afghan river basins. Lastly, the findings are summarized, limitations outlined and an overall conclusion is drawn.",

Invloed van contact met leeftijdsgenoten op de schoolresultaten en vriendschapskwaliteit van jonge adolescenten: Onderzoek over online en fysiek contact met leeftijdsgenoten tijdens de coronacrisis,"Klaasse, Silvana","['Van den Bos, E.', 'Koele, I.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Sinds 11 maart 2020 wordt er gesproken van een wereldwijde pandemie. Dit huidige onderzoek vond plaats in de periode november/december 2020, waarbij de coronamaatregelen invloed zouden kunnen hebben op vriendschapskwaliteit en academische prestaties van adolescenten. Er is in deze studie onderzocht wat de invloed is van de coronamaatregelen op het online en fysieke contact met leeftijdsgenoten van jonge adolescenten. Daarnaast zijn de relaties tussen contact met leeftijdgenoten, vriendschapskwaliteit en schoolresultaten onderzocht. De volgende online vragenlijsten zijn afgenomen bij 119 adolescenten met de leeftijd van 12 t/m 16 jaar: zelfrapportage vragenlijsten over covid-19 en schoolresultaten, de NRI en Lerid FQS. In november/december waren de coronamaatregelen strenger dan in september/oktober, maar er is geen significant verschil waargenomen in het online en fysieke contact met leeftijdsgenoten tussen deze periodes. Er is wel gevonden dat er bij meer online contact met leeftijdsgenoten, sprake is van een lagere vriendschapskwaliteit bij de jonge adolescenten. Fysiek contact met leeftijdsgenoten heeft echter geen significant effect op de vriendschapskwaliteit. Daarnaast blijkt dat er bij meer online en fysiek contact met leeftijdsgenoten, sprake is van significant lagere schoolresultaten bij de jonge adolescenten. Daarentegen hebben vriendschapskwaliteit en de interactie van contact met leeftijdsgenoten en vriendschapskwaliteit geen significante effecten op de schoolresultaten. Voor het welzijn (vriendschapskwaliteit) en de schoolresultaten van de jonge adolescenten is het dus aan te raden het online contact met leeftijdsgenoten te verminderen. Een aanbeveling voor vervolgonderzoek is om te kijken naar het contact met leeftijdsgenoten tijdens en zonder de coronamaatregelen en het onderzoek offline te doen.",
Schadelijke effecten van een gebrek aan empathie in artspatiëntcommunicatie met angstige naasten: De nocebo-effecten van een gebrek aan empathie in communicatie met angstige naasten van patiënten met ongeneselijke kanker,"Leunk, Anouk","['Pannekoek, N.', 'Van Vliet, L.', 'Van Vliet, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek zijn de schadelijke effecten van een gebrek aan empathie in communicatie met angstige naasten van patiënten met ongeneselijke kanker onderzocht. Naasten (zoals een partner, ouder, broer of zus) gaan vaak mee naar de afspraken die de patiënt heeft met de arts en worden betrokken in gehele proces. Het is daarom belangrijk om ook te onderzoeken hoe de communicatie van de arts hen beïnvloedt. Empathie blijkt in de communicatie met patiënten een belangrijke rol te spelen en heeft placebo-effecten op de ervaren angst. Voor dit onderzoek werd gehypothetiseerd dat naasten die van nature angstiger zijn, meer schadelijke communicatie ervaren door een gebrek aan empathie dan minder angstige naasten. Het betrof een kwantitatief beschrijvend onderzoek waarbij er een online vragenlijst was uitgezet. Respondenten werden geworven via sociale media, persoonlijke contacten en patiëntenorganisaties. Er werden in dit onderzoek geen significante verschillen gevonden tussen meer en minder angstige naasten op de ervaren schadelijke communicatie door een gebrek aan empathie. Er werden wel significante verschillen gevonden in de ervaren angst tussen mannen en vrouwen. In dit onderzoek participeerden meer vrouwen dan mannen, waardoor de meer angstige respondenten enkel vrouwen waren. Dit was een limitatie in het onderzoek. Daarnaast was een beperking van dit onderzoek de steekproefgrootte, waardoor er niet werd voldaan aan de assumpties van de statistische toetsen. In toekomstig onderzoek is het dan ook van belang een grotere steekproef te gebruiken.",

Zo worden vriendschappen steeds hechter, wordt de vaardigheid van abstract denken verbeterd en ontwikkelen de adolescenten een eigen identiteit. In het huidige onderzoek werd gekeken naar de invloed van vriendschapskwaliteit en zelfvertrouwen op academische prestaties, gedragsmatige problemen en emotionele problemen bij jonge adolescenten. Dit onderzoek vond plaats tijdens de coronacrisis en 119 participanten van 12 tot 16 jaar oud hebben de volgende vragenlijsten ingevuld: de NRI, FQS, RSES, SDQ en een samengestelde zelfrapportage vragenlijst over de schoolcijfers. Er werden drie meervoudige regressieanalyses uitgevoerd. Er is geen significant effect gevonden van vriendschapskwaliteit op academische prestaties, gedragsmatige problemen en emotionele problemen bij de adolescenten. Tevens is er geen significant effect gevonden van zelfvertrouwen op academische prestaties en gedragsmatige problemen. Er is echter wel een significant negatief effect gevonden van zelfvertrouwen op emotionele problemen. Dit betekent dat er bij een hogere mate van zelfvertrouwen minder emotionele problemen worden ervaren door de adolescenten. Het onderzoek is in belang van het psychische welzijn van de adolescenten. Zo zou bijvoorbeeld kunnen worden gekeken naar een interventie voor het verhogen van het zelfvertrouwen om emotionele problemen te verminderen. In een vervolgonderzoek zou het interessant zijn om een grotere leeftijdsrange te onderzoeken, waaronder de vroege-, midden- en late adolescentie vallen, en zouden er ook oudervragenlijsten meegenomen kunnen worden.",
De invloed van academische prestaties en vriendschapskwaliteit op het zelfvertrouwen en ervaren van stress in jonge adolescenten,"Besemer, Elise","['Koele, I.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Op cognitief en sociaal gebied vinden er veel veranderingen plaats in de adolescentie. Een belangrijke sociale verandering is de toename in vriendschapskwaliteit. Verder hebben deze veranderingen invloed op het mentale welzijn van (jonge) adolescenten. In deze studie is onderzocht wat de invloed is van vriendschapskwaliteit en academische prestaties op het zelfvertrouwen en ervaren van stress in jonge adolescenten tijdens de coronacrisis. Hiervoor hebben 119 participanten tussen de 12 en 16 jaar een online vragenlijst ingevuld over vriendschapskwaliteit (FQS; Bukowski et al., 1994, en NRI-RQV; Buhrmeister & Furman, 2008), zelfvertrouwen (RSES; Rosenberg, 1965) en het ervaren van stress (ASQ; Anniko et al., 2018). Academische prestaties is onderzocht door middel van zelfrapportage van schoolcijfers. Er is een significant negatief effect gevonden van academische prestaties op het ervaren van stress. Dit betekent dat er bij hogere academische prestaties een mindere mate van stress ervaren wordt door de adolescenten. Er is geen significant effect gevonden van academische prestaties op het zelfvertrouwen, en ook geen significant effect van vriendschapskwaliteit op het zelfvertrouwen en ervaren van stress in jonge adolescenten. Een implicatie van het huidige onderzoek zou een interventie kunnen zijn waar bij adolescenten met lagere academische prestaties goed gekeken wordt naar of ze op het goede niveau zitten (VMBO/HAVO/VWO) en de aandacht wordt gevestigd op andere competenties. Hierdoor kan het mentale welzijn van deze adolescenten verhoogd worden. Mogelijk vervolgonderzoek zou een bredere leeftijdsrange van de adolescentie kunnen onderzoeken en meerdere culturen kunnen meenemen.",

In dit onderzoek werd onderzocht wat het effect is van executief functioneren en academische prestaties op het geluk van jonge adolescenten en of deze effecten werden gemodereerd door de klassensfeer tijdens de coronacrisis. Dit is onderzocht aan de hand van een robuuste hiërarchische meervoudige regressie, waarin geluk de afhankelijke variabele is, en de gecentreerde variabelen executieve functies, academische prestaties en klassensfeer, en de interactie-termen executief functioneren x klassensfeer en academische prestaties x klassensfeer de onafhankelijke variabelen zijn. In totaal hebben 119 adolescenten van 12 tot en met 16 jaar oud vier online zelfrapportage vragenlijsten ingevuld, waaronder de Subjective Happiness Scale, de Webexec, en twee zelfgemaakte vragenlijsten voor de academische prestaties en de klassensfeer. De resultaten laten zien dat jonge adolescenten met een hogere mate van executief functioneren ook gelukkiger zijn. Daarnaast zijn er geen significante effecten gevonden van academische prestaties en de klassensfeer op geluk en geen significante interactie-effecten van executieve functies x klassensfeer en academische prestaties x klassensfeer op geluk. De resultaten impliceren dat het van belang is om in het onderwijs meer te focussen op het vergroten van de executieve functies, bijvoorbeeld door middel van computertrainingen, aangezien dit voor meer geluk kan zorgen. Voor vervolgonderzoek wordt het aangeraden om een bredere leeftijdsrange van adolescenten mee te nemen, gebruik te maken van meerdere meetmethodes voor de variabelen, of te controleren voor opleidingsniveau en problemen thuis.",
De rol van vriendschapskwaliteit en klassenklimaat in de leermotivatie en het welzijn van jonge adolescenten,"Gennip, Marijn van","['Koele, I.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Een aanzienlijk deel van de Nederlandse jonge adolescenten kampt met emotionele- en gedragsmatige problemen.

Het doel van dit onderzoek is om inzicht te krijgen in factoren die mogelijk bijdragen aan de emotionele- en gedragsmatige problemen en de leermotivatie van jonge adolescenten. Er werd gekeken naar de factoren vriendschapskwaliteit en klassenklimaat. Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd tijdens de coronacrisis. Adolescenten tussen de 12 en 16 jaar hebben de volgende vragenlijsten ingevuld: NRI, LERID FQS, zelfgemaakte vragenlijst over klassenklimaat, SDQ en de REMO. De data is geanalyseerd met behulp van twee robuuste meervoudige regressies en één enkelvoudige regressie. De resultaten lieten zien dat vriendschapskwaliteit en klassenklimaat geen significante effecten hebben op emotionele- en gedragsmatige problemen bij jonge adolescenten, en dat vriendschapskwaliteit geen significant effect heeft op de leermotivatie. Echter is er wel een trend gevonden, waaruit blijkt dat er bij een hogere mate van vriendschapskwaliteit sprake is van minder gedragsmatige problemen bij de adolescenten, hoewel dit effect niet significant is. Deze gevonden trend biedt inzichten voor interventies die vriendschapskwaliteit verhogen om zo gedragsmatige problemen tegen te gaan. Vervolgonderzoek is nodig voor het onderzoeken van verschillen in gender, culturen, en vroege- en late adolescentie met betrekking tot de invloed van vriendschapskwaliteit (en klassenklimaat) op leermotivatie, emotionele- en gedragsmatige problemen.",

Er is voor zover bekend weinig onderzoek gedaan naar vriendschapskwaliteit en leermotivatie door vrienden op academische resultaten, vooral tijdens de coronacrisis. In dit huidige onderzoek wordt er gekeken naar het effect van leermotivatie door vrienden op academische resultaten en of dit effect gemodereerd wordt door vriendschapskwaliteit bij jonge adolescenten. Daarnaast wordt er gekeken naar het effect van vriendschapskwaliteit op academische resultaten. In totaal hebben 119 adolescenten tussen de 12 en 16 jaar de volgende vragenlijsten ingevuld: Lerid Friendschip Quality Scale (FQS), de Network of Relationships Inventory (NRI), Relationship and Motivation scale (REMO) en zelfrapportage van hun gemiddelde cijfers van de vakken Nederlands, Engels en Wiskunde . Een hiërarchische regressie analyse met bootstrap liet voor geen van de effecten een significant resultaat zien. Een mogelijke verklaring hiervoor is de invloed van de coronamaatregelen op de vriendschap, de leermotivatie en schoolresultaten van adolescenten. Het is van belang dat er onderzoek gedaan wordt naar de effecten van vriendschap en leermotivatie door vrienden op academische resultaten in coronatijd. Dit zou de onderwijspraktijk kunnen helpen bij het maken van interventies om de academische resultaten van adolescenten te verbeteren. Mogelijk kan er vervolgonderzoek gedaan worden naar de invloed van familiebanden op de leermotivatie en academische resultaten, aangezien de adolescenten door de coronamaatregelen meer tijd thuis doorbrengen dan met hun vrienden.",

Therefore, this cross-sectional survey study investigated the acceptability and perceived efficacy of placebo treatments as well as knowledge of placebo effects in a healthy lay sample (N = 58). The following results were obtained: First, perceived efficacy predicted the general acceptability of placebo treatments to a large extent (β = .57, p < .001, R 2 = .33). Second, whereas the perceived efficacy of closed-label placebo’s was higher than that of open-label placebo’s (Cohen’s d = 1.22, p < .001), their acceptability was lower (Cohen’s d = -0.35, p = .010). Third, knowledge of placebo effects was related to the general acceptability of placebo treatments (r = .35, p = .008) and this relationship was mediated by perceived efficacy (ab = 0.34, 95% CI [0.06,0.75]). In conclusion, healthy lay people viewed placebo treatments as more acceptable if they perceived them to be more effective and if the physician was open about placebo use. Moreover, people with more knowledge about placebo effects found placebo treatments more acceptable, and this was partly due to the fact that they perceived them to be more effective.",
"Placebos, Pills and Physicians: an Interplay of Attitudes: A Cross-sectional Questionnaire Study to investigate the Relationship between Medication Attitudes, Placebo Acceptability and Trust in Physicians","Frank, Celine","['Lennep, H. van + Vliet, M. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder, characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain. Medication use in patients is common, but often with minimal benefits and substantial side effects. Recent studies suggest placebos, medication-like treatments without active substances, can decrease pain symptoms, even with the patient knowing a placebo is used. therefore, a placebo approach might be used to treat fibromyalgia. However, research assessing fibromyalgia patients’ attitudes towards placebo use is lacking. To date, the relationship between medication attitudes and placebo acceptability has not yet been studied. Therefore, the primary aim of this cross-sectional survey study was to investigate if placebo acceptability can be predicted from medication attitudes. A secondary aim was to examine whether trust in physicians acts as a moderator of this relationship. Twelve fibromyalgia patients aged 18 or older (M = 42.9) completed the General Attitudes Toward Medication Questionnaire and the Wake Forest Trust in Physicians Scale and rated placebo acceptability with one item on an 11-point scale. A linear regression analysis showed that medication attitudes did not predict placebo acceptability (p = .395). Furthermore, a moderated regression analysis showed that trust in physicians did not moderate the relationship between attitudes towards medication and ratings of placebo acceptability (p = .399). However, due to the small sample size, results should be interpreted with caution. More research with larger samples is needed, to gain further insight into patients’ attitudes towards placebos, to be able to help them to make informed decisions about placebo treatments.",

Het doel van dit onderzoek was het meten van medicijnattitudes onder een populatie van fibromyalgiepatiënten en gezonde mensen (N=70) en het mogelijke effect van deze attitudes op de verwachte effectiviteit van placebobehandelingen te analyseren. Om dit te onderzoeken is er een vragenlijststudie uitgevoerd. De belangrijkste bevinding van deze studie is dat zowel mannen als gezonde mensen significant positievere medicijnattitudes hadden dan respectievelijk vrouwen en fibromyalgiepatiënten (p = .006; p = .024). Een enkelvoudige regressie liet zien dat medicijnattitudes geen significant effect hebben op verwachte effectiviteit van placebobehandelingen (p > .05).

CT may lead to intimate partner violence (IPV) in later life. Insecure attachment has been found to influence the relationship between these two factors, but there is a lack of information on the extent of this association. This study examines the relationship between CT and IPV perpetration and victimization and the role of attachment style as a moderator within this relationship. Methods: An online survey on CT was used to cross-sectionally investigate self-reported CT, attachment styles and IPV within a sample of the general population (N = 421). Path analysis modelling using PROCESS was performed on the moderation model. Results: A direct effect of CT on IPV perpetration was found. There was no direct effect on the individual variables. There was no significant interaction effect of CT and attachment style on IPV. The hypothesis that the relationship between CT and IPV is moderated by attachment style was supported. Discussion: Although more research is needed on the specific effects of the different attachment styles on the relationship between CT and IPV, current findings suggest a moderating effect of attachment on the relationship between CT and IPV. The findings were only partly consistent with earlier findings, which encourages a critical view on the effects of CT on IPV in later life.","['childhood trauma', 'intimate partner violence', 'attachment']"

Method: by using an online survey, self-harming behavior and IPV were measured among the general population (n = 422) in a cross-sectional study. To investigate the relationship between IPV-, perpetration and victimization, and self-harming behavior, simple regression analyses were used. Results: Self-harming behavior had a significant effect on IPV perpetration. IPV victimization had a significant effect on self-harming behavior. Gender did not affect these effects.

CM is linked to mortality, morbidity and many pervasive short-and long-term consequences during life. There are indications that the way children respond to CM have important implications, some behavioral emotion regulation strategies have the potential to buffer against psychopathology, others can actually amplify risk. Hence, this study cross-sectionally investigated whether there would be an association between types of CM (specifically emotional abuse, emotional neglect and/or physical abuse) and the behavioral emotion regulation strategies withdrawal and/or seeking distraction. Methods: behavioral coping styles and childhood trauma was assessed using an online survey among a sample from the general population (N = 599). Simple regression analyses and hierarchical regression analyses was performed to explore the association between CM and withdrawal and/or seeking distraction. Results: CM positively predicted withdrawal. Co-occurrence of multiple forms of CM did not specifically predict more withdrawal and/or seeking distraction. Discussion: although not all hypotheses were confirmed, current findings may contribute to existing data as well to research in the future. Some of the current findings were in line with earlier research, other findings in contradiction to current literature. Limitations and suggestions for further research are discussed to increase knowledge about the possible associations between CM and behavioral emotion regulation strategies by which knowledge, prevention and interventions can be improved.","['childhood maltreatment', 'behavioral emotion regulation strategies', 'psychopathology.']"

Three components of dissociation can be distinguished: absorption, depersonalization, and amnesia. Especially maltreated children are at risk for developing dissociative symptoms. Several studies support a relationship between childhood maltreatment (CM) and dissociation, but previous research often does not differentiate between different types of CM in relation to the different types of dissociation. Hence, this study explored whether different types of CM could predict different types of dissociation. Method: using an online survey, self-reported experiences of CM and dissociation were cross-sectionally assessed among a sample from the general population (N = 549). Multiple regressions were performed in order to investigate whether the different types of CM were predictors for the different types of dissociation. Results: the regression for CM and dissociation, with gender as a covariate, was significant. Emotional abuse and emotional neglect significantly predicted any type of dissociation, and specifically depersonalization; emotional abuse and sexual abuse significantly predicted absorption, with gender as a covariate; physical neglect and sexual abuse significantly predicted amnesia. Discussion: the findings fit previous research concerning the relationship between CM and dissociation, although more research is needed to investigate the specific role of emotional maltreatment in regard to other types of CM and how it is related to dissociation.","['dissociation', 'absorption', 'depersonalization', 'amnesia', 'childhood maltreatment']"

Method: By using an online survey, social isolation and coping styles were measured among the general population (N= 202) in a cross-sectional study. The effect of social isolation on non-adaptive and adaptive coping styles was investigated using simple linear regression analyses. Results: Social isolation had a significant effect on nonadaptive coping styles in general and on the non-adaptive coping style withdrawal. The relationship between social isolation and adaptive coping styles was not significant.

DSH can be used to communicate in a different way, explain how someone is feeling, manage, regulate or escape from overwhelming emotions and cope with stressors in daily life. Insecure attachment among individuals is more likely to be a risk factor to develop DSH. Of the different form of insecure attachment fearful attachment appears to be most related to DSH. This study examines whether insecure attachment is related to more deliberate self-harming behavior. Method: DSH behavior and attachment styles were crosssectionally assed using an online self-report survey among a sample from the general population (N= 391). A regression model and a non-dimensional Kruskal-Wallis test were used to assess the data. Results: A significant association between insecure attachment and DSH was found, and in addition the result of the Kruskal-Wallis showed a significant association between the different attachment styles and DSH. According to the MannWhitney U-test attachment styles in this sample differed from each other with the highest score on fearful attachment. Discussion: this study shows an association between insecure attachment and DSH and fearful attachment appears to be most strongly related to DSH which is in line with former studies. More research is needed to examine this topic as there appears to be a DSH increase among individuals. Furthermore, it is necessary to broaden this study among the normal population.","['deliberate self-harm', 'attachment styles', 'fearful attachment']"

Through technological advancement and globalization, academia has started to put more emphasis on the possibility of convergence between these groups. The convergence threat has been particularly salient throughout the Afghan peace process. As the stage of a destructive and enduring conflict, and a peace mission that has been ongoing for more than a decade, Afghanistan has been the perfect host of crime and terror groups, the biggest example of which is the Taliban. Using the “Crime-Terror Continuum Theory” of Makarenko (2004), this research assesses how crime-terror groups have been affecting the success and failure of the Afghan post-conflict transitions to peace. The processes of demobilization, disarmament and reintegration (DDR) and security sector reform (SSR) are taken as the focal point of post-conflict transitions. The crime-terror continuum in practice is analyzed through a case study of the Taliban in Afghanistan. By conducting a content analysis of various official UN documents, NATO statements, articles by the Afghan Analysts Network and think-tank reports from the Afghan Institute of Strategic Studies, the study finds that the gradual evolution of the Taliban into a hybrid/convergent crime-terror organization has undermined the effectivity of the Afghan peace process, especially with regards to the reintegration phase.",
"Oil, water and conflict in the Niger Delta through the lens of Globalised Hydrocarbon Assemblages","Kruizinga, Imke",['Dr. A. R. Rrustemi'],2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The goal of this research is to study the relationship between oil, water, and conflict in the context of the theory of globalised hydrocarbon assemblages by performing a case study in the Niger Delta in Nigeria. Globalised hydrocarbon assemblages theory criticises the resource thesis, which argues that the state is the main actor in influencing the relationship between oil water and conflict. Globalised hydrocarbon assemblages theory argues that there is a network of different actors active in influencing and shaping this relationship. It suggests that the interaction between internal and actors within a network is vital to comprehend the relationship between oil, water, and conflict. First, a literature study finds that oil pollution and extraction of oil have put stress on the water resources in the Niger Delta. As a result, water security is not achieved, which leads to conflict over water. Next to oil, conflict and weak state institutions also affect water insecurity. Second, qualitative content analysis is conducted to provide a nuanced perspective on the presence of actors, the impact actors have on the relationship, the interaction between actors, and actor strength. The results show that TOCs are the dominant actor within the network with the power to shape and control the behaviour of the state, youths, militants groups, elites, and communities. Their dominance has the strongest impact on the relation between oil, water, and conflict. The findings of the analysis refute the resource curse thesis that the state is the dominant actor and ingrained in one exclusive space. The thesis contributes to the theory of globalised hydrocarbon assemblages as an improved explanation for actor dynamics.",

One intervention that is becoming increasingly more common is the use of a flexible desk, which allows employees to stand up during work without affecting their performance. In this study, we investigated the relationship between posture, arousal, and subjective work experience. Our study follows a within-subject design where participants completed both a flexible (alternating sections of 15-minutes sitting and 15-minutes standing) and a sitting condition (continuous sitting session) across two 2-hour test sessions. A cardiac measure was used to test a predicted physiological proxy of arousal in combination with selfreported arousal. From these measurements we tested whether they mediate the effects of posture on effort, tiredness and task engagement. Our results show that the physiological measure of heart rate variability was not a good proxy of arousal, as it did not mediate the effects of posture on self-reported arousal. Using mediation analyses we were able to show that posture leads to a reduction in effort and tiredness, fully mediated by self-reported arousal. No reliable association between posture and task engagement was found. These results show that using a flexible desk can aid in creating a healthy work environment, even on a short-term basis. Future research can expand on our study by investigating the link between posture and fatigue across multiple task conditions with diverse socio-demographic groups.","['posture', 'flexible desk', 'arousal', 'LF/HF ratio', 'effort', 'tiredness', 'task engagement']"

Due to the covid-19 pandemic, old and new stressors have been investigated, including insomnia, loneliness, hopelessness and fear of covid-19. Therefore, this study examined the correlates of study-stress in students during the pandemic. The sample consisted of 139 participants of the University of Leiden, from the age of 18 years or older who speak fluently Dutch or English. An online survey was distributed, assessing general information such as living situation as well as mental health. For this, five scales were used, including the Study-related perceived stress: Law Student Perceived Stress Scale, the Insomnia Severity Index, the De Jong-Gierveld Loneliness Scale, the Hopelessness: Subscale from the Leiden Index Depression Sensitivity and the COVID – related fear and problem scale. Regression analysis showed that insomnia, loneliness and fear of covid-19 were significantly correlated with study stress. Secondly, an exploratory model was built by a forward selection regression, finding that loneliness was the most significant predictor of study stress, followed by fear of covid-19 and insomnia. When controlling for living alone during the pandemic and being a first-year, living alone was a significant predictor in our study. Regardless, insomnia, loneliness and fear of covid-19 remained significant. In order to improve the situation for students and the adverse effects of insomnia, loneliness, fear of covid-19 and living alone on study-stress, we recommend further research on the variables included especially on their direct (behavioural) consequence.",
"Parental Bonding, Depression, and Anxiety among University Students: the Role of Perceived Stress","Conrado Veiga Bosquetti, Yasmin","['Antypa, N.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Research findings indicate a link between high and chronic levels of psychological stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Internal psychological resources appear to protect against the effect of stressful events on depressive and anxiety psychopathologies. Parental overprotection and care appear to contribute to the formation of such psychological resources (e.g. core schemas, resilience and coping responses, and emotional competence). The study aimed to further investigate the relationships between (1) care or overprotection, (2) depressive or anxiety symptoms, and (3) perceived study-related stress in university students. We hypothesized that perceived study-related stress mediates the relationship between care or overprotection and anxiety or depressive symptoms. Data was collected via an online self-report questionnaire with 138 Leiden University students. Measurements of assessment included Parental Bonding Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Law Student Perceived Stress Scale. Analyses included separate simple linear regressions and simple mediation analyses. Overprotection was positively associated with anxiety symptoms. Care was negatively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Perceived study-related stress mediated the relationships between care and depressive or anxiety symptoms. No association was found between overprotection and perceived study-related stress. Further research with a longitudinal design and larger, more representative samples is needed to replicate these findings and verify their causal order. The effect of overprotection on stress and symptom levels may be investigated in combination with care. Clinical work may address cognitive variables derived from parental bonding experiences that contribute to higher levels of academic stress and depressive or anxiety symptomatology among university students.",

Here, we investigated the effect of the COVID-19 stressor on the word use of those suffering from psychopathology and their healthy controls in a longitudinal design. 1556 blog posts written between February and June 2019 and the same period of time in 2020 were analyzed. In both the clinical and the control group, emotional negativity (d = -0.18), a focus on the present (d = -0.31), and use of insight words (d = -0.15) increased with the appearance of the COVID-19 stressor. Focus on the past decreased in the clinical group (d = 0.32). In the clinical group, the use of insight words was associated with emotional negativity and a focus on the present during the pandemic. In the control group, the use of insight words was additionally associated with a focus on the past and the future. Overall, these findings suggest that those suffering from psychopathology are no more vulnerable to the pandemic’s consequences on mental health than their healthy controls, as reflected in their word use. Yet, since word use on online platforms does not seem to reflect actual well-being very accurately, and considering that our sample was relatively homogenous in terms of mental disorders presented, gender, and age, these results should be interpreted with caution. Future research should replicate our findings with more valid measures of mental well-being and in a more diverse sample.",
Attachment styles and emotion regulation: the influence of different attachment styles on emotion regulation,"Steegt, Danique van der","['Krause-Utz, A.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Emotions are different for everyone. Everyone deals with their emotions differently. You are taught different strategies to deal with your emotions from an early age. In addition, you learn from an early age how to deal with various stressful situations. This is often taught by the parents. The way a child is attached to the parent can influence how a child responds to emotions and stressful situations. In this study, it is therefore examined whether the different attachment styles influence the use of different emotion regulation strategies. By means of an online survey it is examined which attachment styles there are and whether there is a connection between the attachment styles and the different emotion regulation strategies. This is done by means of a MANOVA and a calculation of the correlations with a n = 395. The mediational hypothesis had a significant effect on the relationship between attachment styles and the different types of emotion regulation. Here, a significant correlation was also found between different emotion regulation strategies and insecure attachment. The results are consistent with previous findings of an association between insecure attachment and the maladaptive coping strategies. The research may provide new questions about the relationship between the emotion regulation strategy seeking distraction and insecure attachment.",

This study tested if there is a moderating relationship. Methods: An online self-report survey was used to measure the severity of CSA, the participants’ attachment styles, and the frequency of sexual revictimization which was measured in the context of IPV. The sample (N=430) was recruited via online platforms and Leiden University. The statistical analyses included a simple linear regression analysis and a moderation analysis that were both performed using PROCESS. Results: The simple linear regression was found to be significant supporting that severe CSA leads to sexual revictimization. However, the moderation model was not supported by the statistical analysis; thus, attachment anxiety does not moderate the relationship between CSA and sexual revictimization. Discussion: The link between CSA and sexual revictimization was again supported. The moderation model should be further explored in future studies after methodological refinement. Future studies should also investigate the role of other moderators, such as anti-bisexual prejudice.","['childhood sexual abuse', 'sexual revictimization', 'intimate partner violence', 'attachment anxiety']"

Methods n=454 respondents from a mixed sample (nonclinical and clinical) completed self-report measures of child abuse and Borderline Personality disorder features in an online survey. A simple linear regression analysis was performed in order to test whether higher overall severity of child abuse predicts higher levels of BPD features. Consequently, a correlational analysis was performed in order to investigate the associations between neglect, emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse and affective instability, identity diffusion, negative relationships, self-harm. Results & Discussion The analysis revealed that as severity of child abuse increases, levels of Borderline personality features increase as well, suggesting a positive correlation between the two variables. The correlational analysis results supported previous findings in that emotional abuse was the variable with highest positive correlation with BP features. In turn, sexual abuse was the variable with the lowest positive correlations with BP features. No negative correlations were found.",
Child Abuse and Impulsivity: An investigation of the association between different forms of child abuse and impulsivity levels,"Kleinhans, Jan","['Krause-Utz, A.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Introduction: Childhood abuse has been found to contribute to the development of psychopathology, including Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). However, there is still further investigation needed in order to get information about the associations of different types of childhood abuse and the development of certain psychopathological features. This study focuses on the correlations of physical childhood abuse (CPA) and emotional childhood abuse (CEA) with impulsivity levels and the role of emotion regulation in this context. Impulsivity has been investigated to be a core feature of BPD. Methods: An online survey collecting self-reported data about childhood abuse experiences, impulsivity levels, and maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation resulted in a sample size of n=373. The collected data was analyzed by using hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Results: CPA had a significant positive predicting effect on impulsivity while a significant predicting effect of CEA on impulsivity was not found. Maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation was investigated to have a significant positive predicting effect on impulsivity. Discussion: The findings suggest that CPA predicts higher levels of impulsivity than CEA. Furthermore, a dose-response relationship between CPA and impulsivity was investigated. The association between CPA and impulsivity may be mediated by genetics, gene-environment interactions, observational learning, and maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation which need to be investigated in future research.",
Does childhood trauma influence behavioural emotion regulation?,"Baldi, Nandita","['Krause-Utz, A.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Childhood maltreatment can result in many psychopathological consequences, including emotional dysregulation, and may increase the use of maladaptive ways of behavioural emotion regulation as opposed to use of adaptive ways. The aim of this study was to observe whether this expected relationship between childhood trauma experiences and maladaptive behavioural emotion regulation was to be found. A self-report instrument (the Behavioural Emotion Regulation Strategies Inventory; BERQ) was used on a sample of 495 participants to measure their responses on experience of childhood trauma and use of behavioural emotion regulation. A simple linear regression revealed that childhood maltreatment and behavioural emotion regulation were positively related. Subsequently, a Spearman correlation showed positive relations between use of maladaptive emotion regulation and experience of more childhood trauma, and negative relations between use of adaptive emotion regulation and experiences of childhood trauma. The findings of this study support the hypothesis of a higher risk of maladaptive use of emotion regulation in response to more childhood maltreatment.",

"A Discourse Analysis of the Role of Collective African Identity in the Shifting Conceptualisation of Sovereignty within the Organization of African Unity, 1990-1999","Veen, Jacco van der","['Kinacioglu, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the first decades following decolonisation, African nations were on the forefront of promoting absolute sovereignty and non-intervention. The Constitutive Act of the African Union that was adopted in 2000, grants the organisation the right to intervene in case of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity. This reflects a conceptualisation of sovereignty as responsibility. To understand this shift in conceptualisation of sovereignty, this thesis conducts a discourse analysis of nine official declarations of the Organization of African Unity between 1990 and 1999 through the lens of constructivist theory. It finds that collective identity, in the guise of Pan-Africanism, serves an important role in enabling the shift in conceptualisation of sovereignty through narrative and interaction. This suggests that collective identity, explicitly on the regional level, is an important factor to be considered in the institutionalisation of humanitarian intervention and has implications for the Responsibility to Protect.","['African Union', 'Collective Identity', 'Constructivism', 'Organization of African Unity', 'Pan-Africanism', 'Sovereignty', 'Responsibility to Protect']"
Covid-19 – A Pandemic of Mental Health? The Association Between Loneliness and Problematic Alcohol Use in University Students,"Tavakoli, Sophie","['Antypa, N.', 'Putman, P.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Once transitioning to University, students have elevated levels of both alcohol consumption and loneliness compared to the rest of the population. Additionally, after the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020, the total population experienced higher loneliness and some were more likely to cope with alcohol. This study examined the associations between Covid-19-related fear, loneliness, alcohol use, and the protective role of virtual communication on loneliness during the Covid-19 pandemic. 141 students from Leiden University in the Netherlands reported their levels of Covid-19-related fear, loneliness, quantity and motives of alcohol consumption, and extent of virtual communication through self-report. Fear of the virus was not associated with loneliness or problematic alcohol consumption, but higher loneliness was associated with reduced drinking. Students that kept more contact with loved ones via digital media experienced lower loneliness. Generally, significant differences emerged between Dutch and international students, the latter of which scored worse on most outcomes. In conclusion, this study’s results suggest that students’ alcohol consumption is high yet differs from adult drinking behaviour in that it has an underlying social, not coping, motive. Moreover, international students seem to be particularly vulnerable suggesting the need for an improved care system. Altogether, the results identified important outlets for future research exploring social components underlying students’ alcohol consumption and the gap between international and native students. Further research may address the protective effect of virtual communication to potentially reduce loneliness in students as well as in the general population during exceptional circumstances like a pandemic.","['alcohol use', 'university', 'college', 'loneliness', 'coronavirus', 'covid', 'online communication']"

Why do corrupt candidates keep getting elected? An analysis of the 2021 Ecuadorian general election.,"Velastegui, Mateo","['Dávila Gordillo, D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Although, in theory, corruption scandals should damage political parties' reputation and thus their electoral support, in practice, parties with links to corruption still have electoral support. So far, the voter behaviour literature has not explained this phenomenon. Following Calvo and Murillo's (2019) theory of non-policy endowments, this thesis proposes three strategies that corrupt parties might use to counteract a loss of reputation: 1) populist strategies, 2) reputation management strategies, 3) the promising their voters targeted benefits. I examine the proposed framework with a single case study of the strategies employed by the Movimiento Unión por la Esperanza (UNES) in the 2021 Ecuadorian elections. UNES’ strategies are evaluated with a content analysis of a mixture of electoral spots, speeches, interviews and debates. This thesis shows that parties linked to corruption scandals, like UNES, use populist strategies to expand their political bases and use reputation management strategies to divert voters' attention away from corruption scandals. Importantly, no substantial evidence was found that suggests that parties promise targeted benefits to compensate for the loss of reputation. The use of these strategies likely contributes to their electoral performance, albeit is not infallible.",

Among these are the duration of internationally endorsed norms. In this light, this thesis has set out to uncover the magnitude of the influence that rising powers have on the normative status of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). These rising powers, which are referred to as the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), are known to value the protection of state sovereignty, which plays a large role in framing their views and subsequent implementation of R2P. With use of the norm life cycle theory, the consequences of their rationale on the norm internalisation of R2P were identified. While Brazil and South Africa attempted to further develop the norm, China, Russia and India attempted the opposite by seeking to prevent the further use of the doctrine in its current form. This has led to the realisation that rising powers hamper the internalisation of R2P as a norm.","['Responsibility to Protect', 'rising powers', 'BRICS', 'implementation', 'norm life cycle theory', 'norm internalisation']"
Gender Effects of Crises: The Case of Sweden and Gender Equality,"Kretels, Juliette","['Bayramov, A.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Crises impede the achievement of gender equality worldwide, and are unlikely to cede in the coming years. Therefore, understanding the gender effects of crises is crucial to inform policymakers and strive towards universal gender equality. This thesis seeks to add a new empirical contribution to the existing state of art by exploring how the type of crisis affects gender equality. By pursuing a single-case study focused on Sweden, this thesis aims to address limitations of current literature on this topic, which often lacks thick description and has largely neglected country-specific analyses. Using feminist theory as the theoretical framework, this thesis compares and contrasts the impact of two types of crises on gender equality in Sweden, namely financial and climate crises through document analyses. Whereas financial crises had a limited impact on gender equality, which already enjoyed a high standard pre-crisis, climate crises had a much more profound impact on gender equality in Sweden. By comparing and contrasting findings, this thesis concludes that the type of crisis does matter in terms of the impact it has on gender equality as it varies significantly in terms of the scope and nature of impact.","['Gender effects', 'crises', 'gender equality', 'feminist theory', 'impact', 'Sweden']"

Small States and Securitization in the EU: An analysis of the potential use of securitization in the EU by representatives of two small EU states,"Leander Djerf, Casper","['Veenendaal, W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"New emerging challenges necessitate new security strategies for small states. This research seeks to understand the potential use of securitization by small EU state representatives in the EU. Previous literature on the topic suggests a multiplicity of reasons for small states to join IOs such as the EU, but less attention has been given to how these small states act within IOs. While securitization has previously been understood to occur in a domestic setting, the idea that small states may utilize unconventional means to advance domestic agendas suggests the concept's potential role in an international setting. Both discourse and content analyses are utilized to establish a process tracing model regarding the potential use of securitization in the EU by representatives of two cases, the EU member states Croatia and Estonia. The findings show that only the Croatian case had representatives successfully utilizing securitization. Nonetheless, the findings illustrate that contrary to what has generally been assumed, securitization is not constrained to a domestic setting and does take place between international actors in international relations. Successful securitization can lead to grave consequences if unchecked, and often relies on unfactual narratives. Due to the recent increase of intentional disinformation in politics, awareness of securitization theory’s possible presence, between state representatives and the EU but also more broadly in international relations as a whole, is crucial for both political observers as well as political actors.",
