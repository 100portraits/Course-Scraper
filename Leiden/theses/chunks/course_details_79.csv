Lio and the Central Flores languages,"Elias, Alexander","['Klamer, M.A.F.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis consists of two interconnected parts: a synchronic section dealing with Lio phonology, and a diachronic section dealing with the internal relations of the Central Flores language group, of which Lio is a member. The first section is a description of the phonetics and phonology of Lio (Austronesian), a language spoken in Flores, an island in the Lesser Sunda island chain of eastern Indonesia. I describe the phonemic inventory, phonotactics, stress system and adaptation of loanwords into Lio. This is based on fieldwork carried out in Central Flores in July-August 2017 which focused mainly on Lio. This is a contribution to the state of linguistic documentation in Central Flores, which remains relatively poorly documented. This will also set the stage for the second part of the thesis, because Lio is an important language for reconstructing aspects of Proto-Central Flores. The second section is a historical analysis of the relations of the Central Flores languages, and a reconstruction of Proto-Central Flores. I present evidence that the Central Flores languages form a valid innovation-defined subgroup, which underwent a period of splitting and isolation at the level of Proto-Central Flores. Then I address the internal relations of the Central Flores group and the process of differentiation from Proto-Central Flores to the modern Central Flores languages. Lio is one of the more conservative members of the Central Flores group, and is crucial for distinguishing the reflexes of certain Proto-Central Flores phonemes. The Central Flores group forms a linkage, with patterns of intersecting isoglosses which are not easily captured in a tree diagram. Therefore, the findings of this section will be cast in the framework of Historical Glottometry, a wave model-based methodology which is better equipped to represent and model the relations holding between linkages.","['Eastern Indonesia', 'Austronesian linguistics', 'Descriptive linguistics', 'Languages of Flores', 'Historical linguistics']"

Learning to admire. Education as a Chinese political soft power tool within the Belt and Road Initiative,"Lammertink, Jonas Pepijn","['Pieke, Frank Nikolaas']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Studies have so far focused on China’s cultural tradition as the country’s soft power resource. However, to make the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative a success, Beijing is required to also have an attractive set of political values. This thesis investigates how this need for political soft power translates to the realm of international education, in which the Party-state is pushing for closer cooperation among the countries along the Belt and Road. To this end, official Chinese documents and media reports are studied, with a focus on education initiatives in Kazakhstan. By arguing that soft power behaviour is central to soft power building, this thesis has come to several conclusions. First, Beijing is actively deploying educational cooperation within the Belt and Road Initiative as a means to strengthen its soft power. Second, alongside China’s cultural tradition, political values are relied upon to increase China’s attractiveness, indicating that Beijing attempts to specifically build up its political soft power. Remarkably, these political ideals are primarily related to China’s domestic governance and less to Beijing’s global governance principles.",['PRC China soft power Kazakhstan Belt and Road Initiative Education']
The sense of belonging in the paradox of unity in diversity: a case study of Han Chinese university students,"Goebel, kimberley","['Teh, Limin']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"China consists of an enormous geo-body, with different geographical, cultural, and linguistic differences. Hence, many differences exist within its population, which consists of fifty-five minorities and the Han majority. Although the state creates space for the acknowledgement of internal differences, it also continuously emphasizes China’s unity. This has led to a paradox of unity in diversity. Prior research on cultural diversity within China has mainly focused on minority nationalities, giving less attention to the Han as they are often deemed ‘invisible’. This research will however focus on the Han as it aims to answer the question: “How do Han students identify themselves in the paradox of unity in diversity?” by examining what the sense of belonging of students from Shandong University is built on. The data will show that self-identification of the students is simultaneously vertically and horizontally related, depending on the role of the ‘Other’: identities exist in tandem with each other, while they can also gain preference. Furthermore, through the constant emphasis on ‘national’ and ‘hometown’ identities ―one representing unity, the other diversity― it becomes evident that the paradox of unity in diversity is an integral part of the students’ self-identification.",
A Flower in a Pile of Cow Dung - Yang Yi's Chinese Narratology and Narrative Structure in Jia Pingwa,"Wijker, Stijn Thomas","['Crevel, Maghiel van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In 1997, Yang Yi杨义(b. 1946) published his groundbreaking Chinese Narratology (中国叙事学, 1998), in which he expounded his ideas about a Chinese narratology that developed and manifests itself separately from Western narratology. I will take Yang’s narratology framework as a starting point, with a focus on Yang’s understanding of narrative structure, and do a close reading of the novel The Lantern Bearer (带灯, 2013) by Chinese author Jia Pingwa 贾平凹(b. 1952) (the English translation by Carlos Rojas was published in 2017). I do this in order to answer the following research question: How does Yang Yi’s narratological approach of narrative structure compare to a “Western”-narratological approach of narrative structure? In my analysis, for Western narratology, I will focus on Mieke Bal’s (1997) Narratology: Introduction to the Theory of Narrative. I will argue that Yang’s idea of narrative structure allows for a reading that would not be possible by using only Bal’s theory of narrative structure. As a case study, I will investigate how the narrative structure of Jia Pingwa’s novel The Lantern Bearer relates to narrative structures found in traditional Chinese fiction from the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) period.","['Chinese literature', 'Jia Pingwa', 'Yang Yi', 'narratology', 'Chinese narratology', 'narrative structure', 'Daideng', 'the lantern bearer']"

This thesis assesses the principle’s normative trajectory through the use of Finnemore and Sikkink’s ‘norm life cycle theory’ (1998). This work works toward a better understanding of Russia’s approach towards the emergent norm of human rights by default. By assessing Russia’s approach towards intervention, this study reviews the claim that Russia seeks to undermine the norms that underpin R2P. This has been conducted via a qualitative case study that reviews the following cases: Georgia, Crimea, Libya and Syria. The findings demonstrate that although Russia is actively engaged with the principle’s norm development process, it did also attempt to interpret the norm according to its own preferences. However, only once was the norm was truly undermined - in the case of Crimea.","['Russia', 'R2P', 'Norms', 'Human Rights', 'Norm Life Cycle Theory', 'Crimea', 'Georgia', 'Syria', 'Libya']"

Het oog van de leerling,"Monsjou, Nikki van","['Dijk, Yra van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Samenvatting Door verschillende historisch maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen heeft het literatuuronderwijs een steeds kleinere plaats gekregen in het Nederlandse onderwijs op middelbare scholen. Tegelijkertijd blijkt het literatuuronderwijs vanuit verschillende perspectieven bekeken, een geschikte vorm om invulling te geven aan de vraag om persoonsvorming in het onderwijs meer nadruk te geven. Het perspectief van de leerling ontbreekt geheel in het onderzoek naar literatuuronderwijs dat is bijzonder, want de verwachtingen die leerlingen zelf ten aanzien van de leerstof hebben, blijkt een van de succesvolste factoren te zijn om de leerstof te laten beklijven. Wat literatuur een leerling te bieden heeft, is door Jan van Coillie ondergebracht in de ontspannende, de creatieve, de emotionele, de informatieve en de esthetische functie. Door de verwachtingen van havo- en vwo-leerlingen door middel van interviews in kaart te brengen, zijn daaraan de pragmatische, internationale en de functie in dienst van zichzelf toegevoegd. Concreet houdt dat in dat leerlingen verwachten dat literatuur hen ontspant, of een plezierige vorm van vrijetijdsbesteding is en ze verwachten dat literatuur ze iets leert over de wereld of over henzelf, en dat de vorm daarbij belangrijk is. De creatieve functie ontbreekt. Dat wil zeggen, deze leerlingen verwachten niet dat literatuur hen creatiever maakt. Verder verwachten ze dat het lezen van Engelse literatuur leuker en makkelijker is dan het lezen van Nederlandse literatuur en dat het lezen van literatuur ervoor zorgt dat je je eindexamen beter kunt maken. Deze pragmatische functie van literatuur is geheel ingegeven door hun sociale omgeving, eerder dan dat leerlingen deze verwachting zelf koesteren. Tot slot houden leerlingen er de verwachten op na dat lezen omwille van zichzelf belangrijk is, zonder precies te kunnen motiveren waarom. Door de verwachtingen die leerlingen van literatuur hebben in verband te brengen met de psychologische ontwikkeling van leerlingen als lezers en met hun literaire competentie, bleek dat leerlingen zich als lezer al veel eerder pragmatisch gedragen, dan op basis van de gekozen theorieën mag worden verwacht. Door het competentiemodel van Theo Witte niet diachroon, maar synchroon te gebruiken, kan het pragmatisch lezen op jonge leeftijd met behulp van de zone van naaste ontwikkeling van Vygotsky worden verklaard: een leerling bevindt zich op basis van de combinatie van bepaalde boek- en leerlingkenmerken op een bepaald competentieniveau, maar de leerling vertoont ook kenmerken (soms wel meer) van een lager en hoger competentieniveau. Door de competentieniveaus als leesmanieren voor te stellen, wordt inzichtelijk op welke manieren een leerling leest en dus waar de uitdaging van de docent ligt om hem te helpen op een nieuwe manier te leren lezen, of om hem meer plezier te laten ervaren met de laatst aangeleerde leesmanier. Door het competentiemodel op deze manier te gebruiken, wordt meer recht gedaan aan en kan door docenten beter worden ingespeeld op de ontwikkeling van de individuele leerling. Tevens kan daarmee worden voorzien in de maatschappelijke behoefte om meer nadruk te leggen op de persoonsvorming van leerlingen.",['Educatie Jeugdliteratuur Literatuuronderwijs Verwachtingen']

"'In the Cosmic Game of Thud, Belief Trumps Religion' an Examinaton of the Function of Belief and Divinities in Terry Pratchett's Discworld Novels","Rijnders, Sanne-Milou","['Jonk, Minke']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The focus of this thesis is belief. Belief here is defined as the human act of believing in the validity of a thing, concept or creature, without a necessity of empirical evidence to sustain the conviction. Human society itself is founded upon belief as it requires humans to believe in abstract concepts that maintain human society such as mercy, justice, and honour. According to Grunner (227), religion is of central importance in the Discworld novels, particularly in The Last Hero, Pyramids, Reaper Man and Hogfather. Pratchett lays emphasis on the necessity of belief and the nature of religion to be a societal tool, belief rather than religion is the central focus of these novels. Pratchett holds that belief is a necessary capacity for the human condition; that the ability to believe is humanity’s defining characteristic. Thus belief – and the humans that express it – always hold authority over the religion – and the Gods that inhabit it – that it happens to create. The evidence for the argument presented above is found in the relationship between the Divinities and humans. The Discworld is inherently polytheistic, as many religions exist and all their gods exist in varying degrees of manifestation and power. These Gods are part of the Divinities class. Other members are Anthropomorphic Representations (henceforth ARs) and Auditors. The nature of Divinities is further explored in chapter three. For now, it suffices to say that the relationship of humans to their belief is mediated through the Divinities as on the Disc. What is believed in must exist. Thus, the relationship between Gods and humans reflects on the nature of human belief whereas the relation between Auditors and ARs reflects on the human capacity to create their social reality. Both these relations will be discussed in chapter four. It is through the relations between Gods and humans, humans and ARs, and Auditors and ARs that this thesis seeks to prove its argument.","['Fantasy Fiction', 'Literature', 'Terry Pratchett', 'Humour fiction', 'Belief', 'Religion']"
Strategic Distrust in the Sino-American Trade Relationship: The Pivot to Asia In-Between Containment and Engagement,"Martin, Xiaoxue Jiang","['Wang, Jue']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Why was the Obama administration unable to lessen strategic distrust and tensions in the Sino-American trade relationship, despite its intent to build a constructive relationship with China under the Pivot to Asia? The mistake of the administration, according to this academic work, was not the wish to cooperate and engage with China, but the problematic execution of its proclamations as a result of domestic politics. The Obama administration sent confusing and conflicting signals towards the Chinese government: while its official discourse primarily emphasised cooperation and engagement, domestic resistance pushed the policymaking process towards implementation of foreign policy that suggested intentions of containment. The Obama administration seemed unable or unwilling to follow through on its words, leading to a discrepancy between the stated aims and the concrete results of the Pivot to Asia initiative. As a result, the United States failed to convince Chinese sceptics that it genuinely wanted to cooperate, and that it did not have nefarious hegemonic aspirations. Thus, ultimately, the failure to gather domestic support for engagement with China rendered the Obama administration unable to reduce strategic distrust in the Sino-American relationship.","['Sino-American', 'trade', 'strategic distrust', 'Pivot to Asia']"

"Explaining the Dutch Miracle: Neocorporatism, Neoliberalism or the Third Way?","Schouten, Jeroen","['Gawthorpe, Andrew']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Major policy shifts are rare phenomena on a national level, and identifying the specific moments when these transitions take place is not always possible. In the case of the Netherlands, 1982 proves to be an exception: the ‘Wassenaar Accord’ was a turning point in the governmental policymaking regarding the influence of labour unions and employers’ organisations, after years of economic malaise. The enduring lack of economic growth in combination with high inflation, known as stagflation during the 1970s, paved the way for the new cabinet to force employers’ organisations and trade unions into an agreement on wage cuts in exchange for shorter working years. New policies through a breakthrough agreement were needed because of what an Economist article from 1977 described as the ‘Dutch disease’: high unemployment and lack of economic growth despite natural resource exports. The timing of the negotiations in Wassenaar coincided with neoliberal economists taking over the IMF and the World Bank (Harvey 93). What does this remarkable transition tell us about the way states should handle economic events such as stagflation, or more specifically the Dutch disease? This research seeks to provide the background information on that matter and answer the following question: how should the Dutch policies which were meant to counter the Dutch disease be identified? The processes leading up to the Wassenaar Accord can be traced back to causal mechanisms which will clarify to what extend the Dutch policies where identifiable as policies befitting neocorporatism, if they shifted towards the international trend of neoliberalism and perhaps if the Netherlands found a third way between the two established explanations.","['Economics', 'Dutch Disease', 'Dutch Miracle', 'Third Way Politics']"

In order to achieve this goal, a number of steps had to be taken. First, a foundation for this research’s case study was established by explaining the socio-cultural history of women writers in the Victorian period and by detailing the history of the Digital Humanities and computational research. Secondly, the compilation of the corpus and the methodology of the case study were elaborately explained and all decisions justified. The predominant terminology – the terms writing style and gender – were clarified as well in order to exclude confusion or multiple interpretations of these elements. Thirdly, the results of the case study were presented and interpreted. Here a conscious decision was made to only discuss these outliers briefly instead of examining them with close reading as this study predominantly focused on similarities instead of abnormalities in writing style between women in the Victorian period. Lastly, the limits of this study were discussed in detail and suggestions for future research were made.","['Writing style', 'Gender', 'Victorian Period', 'Quantitative Research', 'Digital Humanities']"

The future of the rentier state: A Qualitative Analysis of Saudi Arabia,"Lande, Tijn van der","['Gonzalez-Vicente, Ruben']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis provides an in-depth analysis on the political and economic consequences for rentier states and their elites, based on three presented reasons. Because of low oil prices, climate mitigation policies and the eroding competitiveness of oil, states are increasingly experiencing the changing structures of the global political economy. To overcome challenges, rentier states are diversifying their economies by emphasizing non-oil alternatives. Consequences are the viability of the rentier model and their overrepresented authoritarian elites are at risk. By investigating an exemplary case this research has tried to better understand the path of the rentier state. Results find Saudi Arabia has begun diversifying its economy in predominantly the tertiary sector and is simultaneously activating its labour force to promote employment outside the government and oil sectors. Fast growing sectors that are progressively providing employment for Saudi nationals are (1) Finance, Insurance, Real Estate & Business Service and (2) Transportation & Communication sectors. Implications are that Saudi Arabia will cease to be a rentier state in the future and that, in tandem, the historically secure position of its authoritarian elites is likely to be at stake. Rising education levels, specialization in the private sector and urbanization levels, give indication the Saudi Arabian society will be able to articulate a demand for representation and accountability. Considering the late introduction of a 5% VAT tax and likely future tax increases, the probability of democratization processes is increasing. The adage “he who pays the piper calls the tune” will likely prove no exception in case of the rentier state. Ramifications for other rentier states are inclined to be corollary to that of Saudi Arabia. Albeit, heterogeneity among rentier states could prove to be detrimental for their survival.","['Saudi Arabia', 'rentier state', 'resource curse', 'oil', 'oil price', 'climate mitigation', 'economic diversification']"

Neoliberalization and Labour Inequality in Japan: Ramifications of Neoliberal Policies in the Japanese Labour Market,"Galaiou, Kyriaki","['Shibata, S.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the relationship of neoliberal policies and growing inequality in the Japanese labour market after the bubble burst in early 1990’s. The purpose of this research is to determine whether labour inequality levels have risen as a result of the neoliberal agendas that the government of Japan has adopted over the past few decades. The policies and the agendas of four Prime Ministers will be discussed: Yasuhiro Nakasone (pre-bubble burst), Ryutaro Hashimoto (post-bubble burst and during Asian crisis), Junichiro Koizumi (pre-financial crisis) and Shinzo Abe (post-financial crisis). This research demonstrates that certain aspects of labour inequality have been altered using process tracing in a multi-disciplinary approach consisting of both qualitative and qualitative sources to analyze the outcomes of these policy measures. The theoretical and empirical analysis showcase that, whilst the transformation of the Japanese economic model has not been linear, there is a gradual neoliberal progress in the labour sector reflected by the continuous deregulation schemes that the administrations have chosen to pursue. The Japanese labour institutions and, therefore, the Japanese social contract have been considerably transformed as part of the neoliberal reforms.","['Japan', 'Japanese Economy', 'Neoliberalism', 'Labour Inequality', 'Japanese Labour Market', 'Japanese Political Economy']"
Layered memories. Four former GDR writers and their autobiographies (1990-1997),"Rooden, Charlotte van","['Paul, Herman']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on the question how literary writers intervened in the debates about the nature and history of the GDR in the period following unification by publishing their autobiographies (1990-1997). The examination of four writers’ autobiographies by separating their epistemic, moral and political relations to the past, while also considering the emotions expressed in them, reveals the underlying, leading arguments in these texts by shedding light on individual, implicit claims. The writers took varying but concrete stances in the debates. The perspective of the writers' relations to the past reveals their arguments and demonstrates that these were primarily based on epistemic and moral claims instead of on direct political suggestions. It shows the variety of the writers' 'political' arguments and explains in which ways the writers made political points or took a stance in these texts, namely by (epistemically) explaining or showing and by (morally) judging, ridiculing or lamenting certain aspects of their lives, thus differentiating the ‘political’ nature of the interventions and the strategies to convey these. Moreover, the thesis' approach reveals and explains the texts' contradictions. These inconsistencies reveal the issues in which the writers' present interpretations cannot be applied to the construction of their pasts, demonstrating where these ‘weak points’ lie and that autobiographies are not as free as fiction. The analysis furthermore reveals strong correlations between the autobiographies’ styles and conceptualisations. Overall, the thesis complements historiography in various ways. For one, it proves the value of studying the autobiographies of literary writers, of whom other scholars of autobiography assumed that they could easily frame their lives around their art and hold back on political questions. The historical approach furthermore contradicts and complements interpretations by literary scholars. It is original in its use of the perspective of relations to the past in combination with comparing expressed emotions in the texts. Ultimately, this analysis sheds light on the ways in which individuals can deal with historical changes impacting not only their present, but also their past lives.","['autobiography', 'GDR', 'literary writers', 'relations to the past', 'history of emotions']"

The Islamic State’s Western Terrorist Campaign “Under the Microscope”: Terrorism as a Strategy of “Glocal” Insurgency,"Zougary, Leila","['Duijvesteijn, Isabelle']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The increasing territorial losses of the Islamic State group (IS) in its Iraqi and Syrian strongholds have led numerous commentators to predict a surge in IS-related terrorist attacks in the West. While the media was quick to report “related” terrorist attacks and IS claims of responsibility, few have actually attempted to assess the groups’ actual involvement in these attacks. Moreover, it was taken for granted that the prime objective of IS’s Western terrorist campaign was to obtain the withdrawal of the coalition from its core terrain. But why continue waging a terrorist campaign against the West while it gives no results? Given the starting assumptions that IS is a rational, unitary actor, this thesis aims to uncover the “whys” of IS’s Western terrorist strategy and its imbrication with an insurgent strategy by empirically investigating whether the loss of territorial control in Iraq and Syria corresponds to changes in IS’s degree of involvement in “related” terrorist attacks in the West and in its claiming strategy. While the data does not support the above-mentioned hypothesis, it indicates a clear change in the group’s claiming strategy. This article concludes that IS’s Western terrorist strategy allows it to showcase its politico-military supremacy to attract die-hard sympathisers and that the interlacing of IS’s strategy of terrorism with its main strategy of “glocal” insurgency points to IS being a product of glocalisation processes of de-territorialisation and re-territorialisation.","['terrorism', 'insurgency', 'islamic state', 'strategy', 'credit-claiming']"
"Grassroots-Government Interactions in the Literary Field: The Dagong Poets' Community of the Pearl River Delta, China","Astrauskas, Balys","['Crevel, Maghiel van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The thesis analyses grassroots-government interactions in the formation and the development of the dagong 打工 poetry scene of Pearl River Delta in Guangdong province, China. Dagong poetry is a wide and eclectic literary genre, written by Chinese rural migrant workers, often referred to as Chinese subalterns, who move to the cities to make a living, because of a lack of economic opportunities in the countryside. I use Bourdieu’s theory of the literary field to survey three main types of agents involved the dagong poetry dynamic and its discourse: (1) grassroots activists, (2) party-state-affiliated cultural policy institutions, and (3) intermediaries, meaning various individuals who advance the interactions of (1) and (2), and may be considered as belonging to both groups. By surveying textual sources, including literary journals, websites and public WeChat accounts, and through qualitative interviews with poets, critics, literary scholars and other agents involved in dagong poetry discourse, I provide in depth case studies of some of most important dagong poetry-related persons and organizations in the Delta region dagong poets’ community. The thesis shows that party-state cultural policy institutions play a significant role in formation and development of a literary community that began as a grassroots movement. Their far reaching influence is present in many aspects and is mainly executed through negotiation with grassroots groups, in which a crucial role is played by top-down and bottom-up intermediaries that are very helpful for attracting financial, political and also discursive support for the dagong poets’ community, but also ensure that dagong poetry discourse remains controlled and in line with government’s cultural policy.","['China', 'literary field', 'dagong poetry', 'rural migrant workers', 'cultural policy']"

When Shakespeare encounters China: A study on the translation strategies in the Chinese translation of Romeo and Juliet,"Battistelli, Alessandra","['Smits, Ivo']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study will first analyse the historical background of Shakespeare in China, which begun with the introduction of the English author as a storyteller during the late Qing dynasty (1640-1911), followed by the publication of official translations in Chinese at the beginning of the twentieth century , the posterior abrupt tragic decrease of the studies under the Communists and its complete death with the beginning of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) , which did not allow Shakespeare to resuscitate until the end of the 70s . The second chapter will be focused on the methods of translations and the theories put forward between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in China, while the third chapter of this study aims at observing how Chinese translators overcame the historical, grammatical and cultural differences between Shakespeare and China, how they rendered the most important traits of the Shakespearean works in Chinese. To conclude, the fourth chapter will be concentrated on the comparison between the original English version of the famous drama of “Romeo and Juliet” and its Chinese.","['translation strategies', 'Chinese', 'Shakespeare']"

Its main objective is to achieve an understanding of how slavery operated in a marginal VOC outpost by exploring its social world; the various levels of social interactions between slaves, convicts, vrijburgers and company servants; the main characteristics of slave resistance; colonial fear and phobia of insurrections; and the intersections between slavery, law enforcement, and the community. It examines the dynamics of imperialism from below in the same way as Clare Anderson explores the life and work of South Asian convicts transported across networks of the British Empire in the Indian Ocean in the latter part of the 19th century. Despite being framed through concepts of slave resistance and power, the primary objective is to bring into focus the world of the slaves, their origins, the nature of their occupations and living conditions, their experiences and struggles, and their ways of organising, socialising, and dissenting","['Slavery', 'Slave Resistance', 'Colonial Power', 'Dutch Mauritius', 'VOC', 'Indian Ocean']"
A neoliberal bias in the European integration process? The role of the European Commission in the implementation of European economic governance,"García Bermejo, Julia","['Oude Nijhuis, Dennie']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The European Union (EU) has often been accused of displaying a neoliberal bias. In the new phase of positive integration, this academic debate has primarily focused on the substantive ideological orientation of European policies within the framework of European economic governance. In this regard, some scholars have argued that, based on the intricacies of its practical operation, the process of implementation can have a considerable effect on the final ideological orientation of these EU policies. This thesis aims to build on the existing debate by focusing on the role played by the European Commission in managing the implementation of these EU policies through the so-called Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs). For this purpose, this thesis carries out a qualitative and contextualised in-depth analysis of the process of implementation by conducting a single case study that focuses on employment-related CSRs issued to Spain during the period 2005-2014. The aim is to find patterns in the ideological orientation of CSRs issued by the European Commission that could reveal the existence of a neoliberal bias in European economic governance.","['European economic governance', 'European Commission', 'Neoliberalism', 'Country Specific Recommendations', 'Employment policy', 'Spain']"

Er is een kwalitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd door middel van diepte-interviews met twaalf rechten- en geneeskundestudenten. Dit onderzoek richt zich op de geloofwaardigheid van gezondheidsnieuwsberichten gepubliceerd door NU.nl. Er is gekozen voor NU.nl omdat het een groot aandeel heeft in het brengen van nieuws. Het is de best bezochte nieuwssite van Nederland. Het accent van dit onderzoek ligt op gezondheidsnieuwsberichten, omdat dit soort artikelen van invloed zijn op het welzijn van de mens. De beoordeelde artikelen zijn door de onderzoeker geschreven en op basis van de eerste zes interviews gemanipuleerd naar aanleiding van de theorie. Uit het onderzoek komt naar voren dat de twee gebruikte theorieën over message credibility van Metzger (2003) en Basch et al. (2017) bruikbaar zijn voor het toetsen van geloofwaardigheid. De factoren die deze onderzoekers aanhalen in hun theorieën zijn volgens de respondenten belangrijk wanneer zij berichten op geloofwaardigheid beoordelen. Daarnaast is er een volgorde van belangrijke factoren te zien, genaamd de primaire en secundaire factoren. Primaire factoren zijn factoren die de studenten eerst noemen wanneer gevraagd wordt waar zij het artikel op geloofwaardigheid beoordelen. Secundaire factoren zijn op een tweede indruk beoordeeld. Deze factoren zijn voor de studenten van belang zijn bij de beoordeling, maar kaarten dit pas aan wanneer de onderzoeker in de richting van deze factoren stuurt en doorvraagt of andere punten opvallen.

"The Shale Revolution and U.S. Foreign Policy Goals: Approaches, Strategies, and Limitations","Costigan, Jack","['Gonzalez, Vicente R.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Energy came to play a significant role in U.S. foreign policy during the twentieth century, particularly as a result of increasing import dependency. However, the last ten years has seen a remarkable transformation in the U.S. energy position that has been termed the shale revolution. The U.S. is now the world’s largest combined producer of oil and natural gas. This paper focuses on investigating how U.S. foreign policy has been impacted by the shale revolution, specifically looking at the strategies that have been adopted in order to advance U.S. foreign policy goals. The traditional divide in the literature on international energy affairs between realism and liberalism is critiqued. An international political economy approach to energy affairs is explained and utilised to show the successes and limitations of the U.S. approaches. The paper argues that the strategies adopted are more successful in advancing U.S. foreign policy goals where they are reflective of the principles of the IPE framework. This is demonstrated through an empirical approach that relies on two case studies that examine the role of the shale revolution, namely the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (Iran deal) and European energy security.","['The Shale Revolution', 'U.S. Foreign Policy', 'International Political Economy', 'International Energy Affairs', 'Energy Policy', 'Energy Leverage', 'Energy Stability']"
Deconstructing Saudi Patriarchy: An Emancipatory Project,"Eskander, Munirah","['Kaptein, Nico']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this paper, I investigate the relationship between the marriage institution and political legitimacy in Saudi society from a feminist perspective. I argue that the inherent inequality between men and women embedded in the Ḥanbalī marriage contract and Najdī customs was utilized by the state in the 1932 Saudi-Wahhābī alliance to create a specific “Saudi patriarchy” designed to subjugate citizens. I further examine the durability of this patriarchy post-1932 and argue that the Saudi state and its ‘ulamā’ successfully continued to manipulate the institution of matrimony to monitor and control the sexuality of its subjects which effectively distracted some citizens from pursuing their political rights. After discussing the creation and application of Saudi patriarchy, I contend that such a system needs to be deconstructed through the reformulation of the Ḥanbalī marriage contract to eradicate the gender hierarchy embedded within it. This research also attempts to explore whether this social change that can create empowered Saudi identities can also lead to political reform.","['Patriarchy', 'Saudi Arabia', 'marriage', 'feminism', 'gender', 'marriage contract', 'male guardianship']"

The Effects of Code-Switching on Cognitive Control,"Bouwer, Vivian","['Bosma, Evelyn']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Intrasentential code-switching requires cognitive control in production (Verreyt et al., 2016) as well as comprehension (Adler et al., under review). The first language needs to be inhibited as soon as the second languages is encountered. The neurological system that is associated with cognitive control may stay active for a while after being triggered. Cognitive control is used for any (cognitive) task that requires inhibition, selected attention or decision making. An example of such a task is the Flanker task, in which a participant has to determine the direction of an arrow surrounded by four (congruent or incongruent) distractors. In general, when the arrows all point in the same direction (congruent condition) participants have a shorter reaction time than when the surrounding arrows point in the opposite direction of the target arrow (incongruent condition). The effect of code-switches on Flanker trials has been studied behaviourally. These studies show that processing a code-switch has a positive effect on the reaction time on the incongruent Flanker trials. In this study, we support previous behavioural findings with an electrophysiological investigation of the effect of code-switch detection on cognitive control. We recorded the EEG of 34 participants while they alternated between reading sentences (with and without code-switches) and Flanker trials. In the analysis of the EEG, we were specifically interested in the P300 component, which is associated with shifts in attention. The P300 amplitude is higher when more cognitive control is required (Neuhaus et al., 2010). Since incongruent Flanker trials require more cognitive control than congruent trials, the classic Flanker effect is that the incongruent trials produce a larger P300. However, after being activated by a code-switch, if the cognitive control mechanism indeed stays active for a while, the P300 amplitude of an incongruent Flanker after a code-switch would be lower than one after a sentence without a code-switch. The mean ERP amplitudes were analysed with a 4-way repeated measures ANOVA. Significant interactions were found between sentence type and congruency. There was a significantly larger P300 in the congruent condition than in the incongruent condition, but only when the preceding sentence did not have a code-switch. The P300 was significantly larger after sentences with a code-switch than after sentences without a code-switch, but only in the incongruent condition. There was no effect of sentence type in the congruent condition. These results provide electrophysiological support for previous findings by Adler et al., (under review).","['Code-switching', 'Cognitive control', 'P300', 'ERP', 'Bilingualism']"

The Trump – Tsai phone call: a Turning Point in Cross-Strait Relations? A Discourse Analysis of the PRC’s reaction in State-Led Newspapers and the Construction of National Identity,"Kern, Julia Maria","['Schneider, Florian']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyses newspaper articles from two state-led newspapers of the PRC regarding the phone-call between the president of the US, Donald Trump, and president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, on December 2, 2016. This phone call suggested a possible attempt by the US to undermine the One-China policy, an essential part of China’s international relations. This thesis links the outcomes of the discourse analysis with the literature review, which explains the importance of discourse in international relations and the construction of a national identity. The analysis mainly focuses on three discourse topics and discursive strategies (intertextuality, language and pictures) of the newspaper articles. Both parts concentrate on the different identity manoeuvres which construct a notion of China’s national identity. Analysing the different articles showed that this phone call was an unexpected and an unacceptable event for the PRC. The discourse regarding China’s military power occurs quite strong in the period after the phone call. With regard to the construction of national identity, concluded is that the newspaper articles construct an identity of China which is ‘unassailable’ for any changes from external actors in Sino-U.S. or cross-strait relations. The position of Taiwan in China’s identity is constructed in a conflicting way by the articles. Language features often identify Taiwan as the ‘other’, which excludes Taiwan from China’s identity. However, when speaking about Sino-U.S. relations, Taiwan is included in China’s identity.","['Trump', 'Tsai Ing-wen', 'Taiwan', 'China', 'Cross-strait', 'PRC', 'State-led Newspapers', 'Xi Jinping', 'United States']"

The international and transnational solidarity network are to be seen as advocacy networks, and their actions, history, and role on implementing human rights norms will be analyzed. The domestic dimension of this advocacy will be explored through an initiative emerged from the Dutch society – the Polisario Komitee. The transnational dimension, in its turn, will be analyzed through the European Coordinating Conference of Support to the Sahrawi People (EUCOCO). The work will shed light on how these initiatives operate, in order to analyze if they prove to be effective in promoting the change they are committed to – as well as what are the elements that influence negatively in their advocacy. For that, the methodological approach includes a combination of primary archival sources, interviews, and literature on human rights, International Relations, and advocacy networks.","['Western Sahara', 'Activism', 'Human Rights', 'Self-determination', 'Morocco', 'Advocacy networks', 'Non-state actors']"
Towards a Corruption-free Society: The Application of Blockchain Technology in the Mexican Public Administration and Services,"Niemann, Dominik Ulrich Aldo","['Alves Vieira, Eduardo']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Comparing corruption with an infectious disease, the United Nations Convention Against Corruption refers to corruption as “an insidious plague that has a wide range of corrosive effects on societies” (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 2004, iii). With this in view, corruption is considered to be systemic to Mexico. Corrupt behaviour on highest political and economic levels is passed down across society and excludes the poorest from access to social and public services, economic participation and support. Given the stagnating poverty level, with an estimated 47,3% of people living in poverty in 2016, corruption is seen as a major impediment to economic and social development in Mexico (CONEVAL 2016; Castro and Nevárez 2015, 220-1). Although the Mexican government has, time and again, made efforts to introduce binding anti-corruption laws, these legislative changes have proved inefficient due to weak rule of law and the lack of transparency in the political administration (Davis 2008, 55-6, Tromme and Otaola 2014, 573). The structural digitisation of bureaucratic processes in the public sector is seen as a possible means to curb corruption by establishing transparency, efficiency and the rule of law (Boucher 2017 12; Kshetri and Voas 2018, 12; Hughes 2017, 661-3). Yet, in the Mexican case, although a collective political will to implement such strategies for structural digitisation is visible, there is adverse evidence to the effectiveness of such efforts as systemic corruption seems to be perpetuated at individual level, undermining collective efforts. Given these circumstances, Blockchain technology has recently emerged as a technological solution to many of these issues related to corruption. In fact, the technology has been ascribed the potential “to fundamentally shift the way in which society operates” (Wright and De Filipi 2016, 2). As such, the proposed paper hypothesises that a government-led application of Blockchain technology in public administration and services could indeed facilitate a structural eradication of the prevalent systemic corruption in Mexico. Based on this assumption, a practical framework is suggested for the structural implementation of Blockchain technology in Mexico’s public administration and services.","['Mexican Public Administration and Services', 'Anti-corruption', 'Blockchain Technology', 'Systemic Corruption']"

Troublesome Patients as Experienced by Doctors in Japan,"Geffen, Justus van","['Ezawa, Aya']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since roughly around the start of the current millenium, there has been a growing trend of doctors and pharmacists in Japan speaking up about what they perceive to be unreasonable attitudes and behaviours exhibited by patients and the media towards medical experts who work in clinical situations. One example of a clinical discourse in Japan that has been particularly concerned with this issue is one dubbed 'iryo hokai'. The main thrust of the argument made by medical caregivers who speak within this discourse is that current-day patients' unachievably high expectations of doctors' ability to successfully cure disease is leading to an increase in malpractice lawsuits, and that this will encourage doctors to abandon their work out of fear for being sued, eventually causing modern medicine to collapse due to understaffing. This paper aims to perform a discourse analysis on the concrete expressions of such professional frustration, specifically using articles published in commercial magazines aimed at a professional readership to examine doctors' lived experience with patients that they deem 'troublesome'. As a background for discussion it also presents a short history of the relevant issues as they have developed over roughly the past two decades. The analysis itself is informed by existing social theory on the configurations and functions of power in modern society, especially as it pertains to professionalized biomedicine and its role in creating and administrating populations.","['doctor-patient relationship', 'power', 'medical anthropology', 'iryo hokai', 'Japan']"

Euroscepticism: A Pawn in the League's Agenda,"Mazzocchi, Claire","['Weyenberg, Astrid van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Populism is becoming more and more a predominant political phenomenon with several European countries. Many are the debates concerning the real nature of populism, its political affiliation, agenda and particular features. Although there is not a comprehensive and clear definition of populism yer, many scholars have proposed a set of themes aimed at grouping populist parties according to some specific characteristics. One of these themes is Euroscepticism. Indeed, common understanding refers to populist parties as profoundly Eurosceptic. However, this thesis argues that populist parties are not intrinsically Eurosceptic, rather their Euroscepticism depends on their intrinsic need to create an adversary, an enemy to combat that can take countless forms as the European Union. This thesis investigates one example, the Italian populist 'League' party, which has recently achieved an important electoral victory. The party's ambiguous rhetoric and agenda will be considered. This in order to highlight the natural behaviour of the League, always keen on identifying one enemy to battle per time. Three are the periods taken into consideration and, accordingly, three are the enemies upon which they have focused their agenda: the southerners, the European Union and the Immigrant.","['Populism', 'Euroscepticism', 'League', 'immigration']"

Russian objectives in Donbas,"Monster, Ruben","['Wilbrink, Hans']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In April 2014 an armed conflict broke out between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk (Donbas) regions in Eastern Ukraine. The extent to which the Russian government supports the separatists of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics remains a topic of scholarly debate. Numerous academics have come up with interpretations on Russian foreign policy towards Ukraine but these fail to explain the behaviour of the Russian government in Donbas. This thesis will assess what the foreign policy objectives of the Russian government are in Donbas and how these have changed since April 2014. During the first phase of the conflict, the Russian government attempted to introduce the neo-imperial myth of Novorossiya in order to justify separatism throughout South-Eastern Ukraine. This project failed as the separatist drive did not spread to the regions of Kharkiv and Odesa. Thereafter the Russian government started to focus on keeping the conflict ongoing by militarily intervening to prevent the Ukrainian Army from defeating the separatists but not letting the separatists win the armed conflict either. The Russian government governs the separatists republics without participation of Ukrainian separatists, provides them with necessary financing but at the same time drains the region of its economic resources. The main goal of the Russian government in Donbas is to destabilise Ukraine and keep the armed conflict ongoing by sustaining two highly disruptive separatist republics.","['Ukraine', 'Donbas', 'Donbass', 'Russia', 'Foreign policy', 'Separatism', 'Former-USSR', 'Donetsk', 'Luhansk', 'Armed conflict']"
Influences on privacy protection behaviour of Japanese people,"Huskes, Tim","['Herber, Erik']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Privacy has become the subject of heated international debate in recent years. In particular the privacy of personal data has emerged in the centre of discussions about privacy. Some argue that privacy is not a universal concept, and that people from different countries differ in their attitude towards privacy. There is a contested notion that Japanese people have little to no sense of privacy. Existing research has focussed on how Japanese people conceive privacy and their attitude towards privacy, but privacy protection behaviour is not examined, nor is the translation from the conception of privacy and attitude towards privacy to protection behaviour discussed. This thesis examines influencing factors on the privacy protection behaviour of Japanese people through interviews. The analysis of the interview data uses a model of privacy-related behaviour, developed by Beldad, De Jong et al. (2011) as a comprehensive replacement for existing less complete models. Participants in this study mainly conceived privacy as their personal information. The chief method of protection was withholding information. The influences on privacy protection behaviour concentrated in participants' concerns about their information privacy and their ability to perceive risks to their information privacy.","['information privacy', 'privacy protection', 'privacy-related behaviour', 'online privacy', 'privacy awareness']"
Latin America’s Varying Levels of Dependency on China,"Röhlicke, Tobias","['Valdivia Rivera, Soledad']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Throughout the 20th century the region of Latin America has been widely influenced by external actors such as the United States or international organizations, like the IMF or the World Bank. The influences of those actors gave rise to “dependency theory”, which highlights the inequalities between more powerful actors of the so-called “center” of the world and those of the “periphery”. As a response, Latin American countries have engaged in different attempts to decrease the influence of those external actors, while increasing their own. In the early 2000s, due to changes in its foreign policy, the focus of the United States on Latin America has decreased. The risen gap has allowed the recently grown superpower China to focus on the region. Consequently, the East-Asian country has become the first or second biggest trade partner for states like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico or Venezuela. Next to the risen trade other bilateral relations, such as investments, combined attempts of development and political relations, have increased. While there are several apparent benefits for both sides, criticism has been voiced regarding a new version of dependency on China replacing that towards the United States. However, such criticism has mainly focused on assessing the international relations between China as a state and Latin America as an entire region. Therefore, by addressing the rising dependency, this paper will show that, in regard to Sino-Latin American relations, the region of Latin America cannot be analyzed as a whole but has to be divided into its nation states. By comparing the two case studies Chile and Venezuela and their respective relations with China the varying levels of dependency between China and different Latin American states will be portrayed.","['China', 'Latin America', 'Chile', 'Venezuela', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'South-South Relations']"

This paper’s intention is to explain this phenomenon by studying the impact of local culture and the gender roles that it engenders on the political behaviour of female politicians, and how female leaders make use of those gender roles to gain popularity and support. The paper runs through the local history and culture of the aforementioned regions with respect to female presence in politics, and exposes the male/female leadership models used by female politicians. Thence, it takes a deeper look into three contemporary female political figures, each corresponding to a different female leadership model: Cristina Kirchner for “wife”, Michelle Bachelet for “daughter”, and Meral Akşener for “neither”, signifying an independent female leader. The results obtained through visual and Critical Discourse Analysis reveal that the three scrutinized female politicians resort to both female and male gender roles, enabling them to benefit from the advantages of both gender roles, consequently increasing their political popularity and grip on power.","['Gender Roles', ""Women's Studies"", 'Political Science', 'Cultural Studies', 'Latin America', 'Turkey', 'Marianismo', 'Critical Discourse Analysis', 'Kirchner', 'Bachelet', 'Aksener']"

The process of transitional justice is supposed to find the truth about the violations that occurred during a conflict and to create justice for the victims. In Peru, the transitional justice process started after the fall of the regime of former President Alberto Fujimori in 2000, and was supposed to address the human rights violations that occurred during the civil war between the State and the communist guerrilla group called the Shining Path. During Fujimori’s authoritarian regime from 1990 until 2000, there was a high level of political corruption, with branches like the judiciary, Congress, the military, the police, and even the president himself all being very corrupt. The transitional justice process tries to create more transparency and reduce impunity, which could lead to a decrease in the level of corruption. However, corruption is often not considered a human rights violation and therefore not focused on during the transitional justice process.","['Political Corruption', 'Transitional Justice', 'Peru', 'Human rights violation', 'President Fujimori', 'Post-conflict corruption']"
Economic Disaffection in Manufacturing States: Examining Nebraska’s Manufacturing Sector to Understand the Economic Disaffection as an Outcome of Supply Side Economics,"Beelen, Linde Merel Henrica Theodora","['Gageldonk, Maarten van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis will examine the economic disaffection present in manufacturing states in the US, through the case study of Nebraska. With the 2016 Presidential Election, this discontent is often given as a motive for voting for Donald Trump. A logical link to make when considering economic disaffection is the link with the Great Recession. The Great Recession certainly has had a large influence on the bad shape of the US economy, but this thesis will point out that structural changes to the economy are the main culprit of the dissatisfaction of the American working class. The implementation of supply side economics has caused for the manufacturing sector to decline. The changed tax system, the increased trade deficit, education shifting its focus on technology, and enforced globalization are outcomes of the theory of supply side economics, and all have had a negative impact on the manufacturing sector. Nebraska followed the trend of these four elements, and therefore witnesses the decline of its manufacturing sector. Nebraska’s poverty rate and income inequality are growing, and the job opportunities for low-skilled employees are decreasing. Nebraska serves as an example for other manufacturing states in the US where this economic discontent is present as well, because of the economic hardship the working class in Nebraska is experiencing as a result of the implications of supply side economics to the manufacturing sector.",

This is due to the ability to create and maintain peace and stability in a region that is formed by ten countries with extremely diverse political, economic and socio-cultural backgrounds. Conflicting territorial claims in the South China Sea by four ASEAN countries (Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines) with the territorial lines drawn by China, remain the most pressing challenge for the region and represents a worrying geopolitical struggle that is difficult to reconcile with the common perception of ASEAN as a strong and united regional powerhouse. ASEAN has assumed the South China Sea issue under its multilateral framework, involving China in the creation of a code of conduct in the SCS. Despite these efforts, the position of ASEAN itself on this issue has been inconsistent, as evidenced in its political stance through its annual statement and communique. While the main literature has observed this phenomenon under the assumption that the ever-growing Chinese economic power, is the element that could explain what we are observing in the region, I argue that even though the economic power of Beijing does play an important role, it is not enough to explain the various positions that we are seeing between the member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and that other factors need to be taken into consideration to better understand the underlying mechanisms that are at play in the region .","['ASEAN', 'China', 'South China Sea Dispute', 'SCS', 'Disunity']"

Comparing to it decades ago, people nowadays can access the internet very conveniently. Therefore, the information they have acquired about this program through internet is assumed to be more thorough than it was in the days people could only rely on papers. However, the fact is that, according to the statistics of Ministry of Justice (2018), in the past 10 years, the number of new foreign trainees has surprisingly grown 168%, from 89,033 (2007) to 274,233 (2017).

These countries have been chosen because similar to the EMU, they share similar characteristics that are essential for the formation of a monetary union. This thesis will look a key questions regarding whether or not these countries should do it, if it’s optimal and if they can form an optimal currency area. To answer these questions, this thesis will look at macroeconomic variables including inflation and government debt. The combination of academic sources and hard economic data will ensure that the question can be answered in a clear and consistent manner. At the end of this thesis there will be a general conclusion whether or not these countries should form a monetary union and if this can become optimal.","['Monetary Union', 'Latin America', 'Chile', 'Colombia', 'Peru', 'Brazil', 'Monetary Policy', 'Optimal Currency Area']"

"Women and Peace Processes: An Examination of the Implications of the Peace Process for Women´s Political, Social and Economic Status in Guatemala","Werink, Marieke","['Choi, Nan']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The 1996 Guatemalan Peace Accords were the result of a long Peace Process that marked the end of a 36-year lasting civil war. These Accords aimed to end violent conflict and reconstruct the country. The majority of individuals involved in this Peace Process were male, but a range of women managed to take part in the Peace Process through both formal and informal channels. This thesis focusses on this formal women’s involvement, where two women were placed on the negotiating teams and a range of women’s organizations formed part of the civil society structure within the Peace Process. Women in Guatemala’s pre-conflict society faced significant barriers to the full exercise of their rights. Openings into the Peace Processes therefore provided women with opportunities to influence the outcome and thereby improve the status of women overall in Guatemalan society. In recent decades, there has been increasing scholarly attention to the lack of women’s involvement in peace processes, focussing mainly on ways to overcome this lack of involvement. Although further scholarly attention has been set on peace processes as a way for women to advance their status in society, empirical evidence regarding this line of reasoning is often lacking. This thesis aims to fill this gap by undertaking a literature based qualitative research in the form of a within-case study. Various indicators on the status of women in Guatemalan society are compared across time to determine if women’s involvement in the Guatemalan Peace Process has impacted the Peace Agreement and following policies, and in turn has led to changes in the status of the general population of women throughout Guatemalan society. This research demonstrates that through formal involvement in the Guatemalan Peace Process the status of women has not improved as much as envisioned, but still progress has been made. The findings of this thesis indicate that women in such processes cannot be expected to raise certain topics on the basis of their gender. Furthermore, it demonstrates that women’s participation in peace processes could lead to social transformation, but that the nature and features of such an involvement are limiting or strengthening to the eventual results in terms of women’s status in society. This establishes the need to thoroughly analyse how the nature and features of their involvement can be deployed to maximize the effect of women’s inclusion in peace processes as a way to establish societies with a higher degree of gender equality.","['Gender', 'Women', 'Peace Processes', 'Guatemala', ""Women's Involvement""]"

South Africa's Land Reform: Another Zimbabwe?,"Rechberg, Amely MIra Donata Sophie","['Smith, Karen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Looking at South Africa in a contemporary context, one is forced to take a closer look especially at its economic and political struggles. Trying to grow out of its subaltern position and legacy of its past, South Africa yet remains to struggle with corruption and inequality in many dimensions. The heritage of land inequality has been formalized through the Native Land Acts in 1913 and 1936, which strangulated commercial farming activities of the black majority and thus, later gave incentives to change the hereditary constraint to South Africa’s economy. The Land Reform Act of 1994 was formulated to overcome the inherently unequal distribution of land in South Africa. As Ward Anseeuw states in his paper on the effectiveness of South Africa’s land reform, the African National Congress (ANC) during its ascension to power in 1994 promised a restructure of the economy through the redistribution of land; the growth, employment and redistribution program (GEAR). Its objective was to redistribute the land prior given to the white minority and fix the legacy of the past by making land available to the black population. However, taking a closer look at the “success story” of the countries’ ambitious program and recent heated debates and developments in South Africa, one comes to ask, if the country is heading the same way as Zimbabwe? Zimbabwe, a country in which land reform remains at the heart of its political and economic challenges, demonstrates that wrong and flawed implementations lead to a national hunger crisis, violence and the distortion of the country. South Africa, having a better political and policy framework should be heading towards a positive future of land distribution and agriculture. But, the complexity of the problem offers a difficult accomplishment of this task, especially when one observes recent violence against white-owned farms and escalating racial rhetoric in South Africa. Especially, Zimbabwe’s land occupations may have fueled fears of commercial farmers and breathed new lives in the demand for land reform elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa’s land reform addressed and implemented as a process to redress the apartheid colonialism and the Native Land Acts of 1913 and 1936, to fuel South Africa’s economy and to reduce its stigma of racial and economic inequality. The question of the success of land reforms therefore identifies a wider and older issue South Africa is fighting with for decades. If it will follow Zimbabwe’s footsteps there remains speculation, but the succession of its land reform wont set sail towards a brighter horizon, if South Africa does not change its course in the debate on land restitution, land tenure and land redistribution and sets clear policies on the acquisition of land. The government, since 1994 has relied on its 1996 Constitution and on the 1997 White paper on Land Reform, but the land reform in its essence has failed and will continue to be unsuccessful in its implementation, if it doesn’t revise its land reform and if there are no actions taken to change its fate. This paper will therefore aim to identify, what after twenty-two years after the transition to democracy and the commencement of land, in South Africa is going wrong and if or how its land reform can possibly be saved.","['Land Reform', 'South Africa', 'land distribution', 'inequality']"

Why did China establish the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB)?,"Groot, Jeroen","['Wang, Jue']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"China’s rise came with relatively modest objectives compared to their weight; they have not been trying to rule the Asia-Pacific let alone the world. Recently, however, Beijing has started to more pro-actively claim their space in the international community, best exemplified by their establishment of the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB) in 2013. This multilateral development bank is part of China’s “great power diplomacy“ efforts launched by Xi Jinping, a bank of which the ideological and political motivations remain unclear and are speculated upon among media and within academic circles. Hence this paper’s focus on the question “why did China establish the AIIB and what motivations have informed its creation?”. Using the Neo-Gramscian critical theory of hegemony for international relations, this paper focuses on ideas and ideological narratives that could have potentially informed the motivations behind the creation of the AIIB. The paper is a response to the predominantly realist and liberal institutionalist literature on China’s rise, and aims to go beyond the self-affirming nature of state-centric analysis. The literature review is structured around three central topics: China’s rise and internationalization, its engagement with institutions and multilateralism, and the establishment of the AIIB. Following the literature review, the case study investigates a possible interrelation between China’s historical political traditions, Xi’s recent ambitions in global governance, and the motivations behind the creation of the AIIB. The paper argues that the creation of the AIIB is informed by a number of motivations that are beyond its official narrative, namely that the bank 1) redistributes the industrial overcapacity of China’s core industries; 2) helps maintain economic growth by opening up new markets, or as an 3) alternative institution in response to a failing global governance system. Most importantly, 4) the AIIB is argued to potentially function as a transnational mechanism to extend China’s domestic social relations in the form of ideas, norms, and values on a diplomatic, economic, and cultural level through project engagement in member states. The AIIB’s motivations are therefore not merely informed by economic or institutional motives, but also by socially informed ideological debates that find their basis on all levels of Chinese society.","['Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB)', 'Multilateral Development Bank (MDB)', ""People's Repiublic of China (PRC)"", 'Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)', 'Global Economic Governance', 'Xi Jinping', 'Neo-Gramscianism Critical IR Theory', 'Configuration of power relations and ideas', 'Institutions and multilateralism', 'China’s rise as a global power']"

On the contrary, EU and UN initiatives, such as UNIFEM and UN women, function as an instrument in which women can claim their rights. However, there are shortcomings in the current legal framework regarding women in migration that can and ought to be improved. First, the contextual and relational nature of gender-based discrimination remains unacknowledged. Second, treating all migrant women as universally vulnerable leads to the marginalization of the subgroup. Third, the EU guidelines are non-binary and do therefore not ensure gender equal treatment and furthermore gender is only an addition to the existing legal framework, which treats women as ‘exceptional’ and not as a part of the main assumption. Fourth, the EU lacks empowering instruments for migrant women. These challenges must be addressed if the EU wishes to fulfill its normative role of ensuring gender equality in migration.","['Women in migration', 'Gender-based discrimination', 'EU legal framework', 'Victimisation', 'Empowerment']"

Who sings? Who Acts? Sexual Behavior in Reggaeton Music and Video Clips,"Villamizar Diez, Gabriela","['Krakowska Rodrigues, Kamila']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Given the social and cultural relevance of gender representations in Reggaeton and the social and political debate it has triggered in Latin America, the question that the thesis is aiming to answer is: How are gender stereotypes of male and female sexual behavior represented and challenged in Reggaeton? In order to do so, four Reggaeton songs were analyzed. The analysis was made through the close reading of both lyrical fragments and video footage material and building upon Doing Gender Theory framework of Candace West and Don Zimmerman (1987). By choosing two songs sung by women -Reggaetoneras- and two by men -Reggaetoneros-, the thesis does not aim to generalize on these views but rather develop a comparative study on the discourse within singers’ gender. Regarding sexual behavior in Latin America, the three gender-based stereotypes analyzed in the four songs were (1) Objectification of Sexuality, (2) Machismo and (3) Heteronormativity. The thesis concludes that based on the representation found in Reggaeton of gender stereotypes of sexual behavior, the role of Reggaeton represents rather than challenges the status quo of gender identity in Latin America. This research concludes that the analyzed Reggaeton can be described as misogynist. Meaning that even though this music genre cannot be considered steady in its representation of what is the connotative understanding of the traditional Latin male and female, female characters in Reggaeton do present more prejudices than males.","['Sexual Behavior', 'Reggaeton', 'Male and Female Gender Stereotypes', 'Music Video Clips']"

The Chinese tech industry also often exemplifies that it is at the forefront of global blockchain technology development with its numerous fast-growing companies and tokens such as DeepBrain Chain, Ontology Network, NEO, Tron, and QTUM, thus suggesting that the tech must be succeeding in certain areas, perhaps either as a result of government regulation, or in spite of it.

The Syrian Business Elite’s Role in the Syrian Conflict: A class Narrative,"Alatassi, Siham","['Henderson, Christian']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The political situation in Syria has captured the interest of many scholars since its independence in 1946, and especially with the rise of the socialist Ba’ath party, and its patron Hafez Assad, to power. Assad’s authoritarian rule paved the way for Ba’ath party members and his immediate family members to accumulate wealth and power. This patrimonial approach has contributed to reshaping the class system and creating different types of the bourgeoisie. When Bashar Assad succeeded his father in the year 2000, the political-economic strategy in Syria changed a little by depriving the Ba’ath party members of their privileges and giving them to other prominent government officials and members of the country’s upper and upper-middle classes through neopatrimonial approaches. The new ‘state bourgeoisie’ in Syria did not only include Alawites who are directly related to Assad, but the new order also included Sunnis and Christians who were given a chance to get wealthy by proving their loyalty to Assad and cooperating with the regime. Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict in 2011, Syrian businesspeople have either continued supporting the regime or decided to remain silent and leave the country. Although the popular narrative of the Syrian conflict is largely sectarian in nature, sectarianism is not the only significant factor. Class has played a big role in the public’s dismay and contributed to the outbreak of the uprising. The business elite’s reaction to the conflict has contributed to the longevity of the conflict one hand and that of the Assad regime on the other. The loyal elites have benefited largely from this ongoing conflict whereas others who remained neutral risked the confiscation of their properties, and that of their family, and various terrorist charges. This thesis tackles the Syrian conflict from a different angle and highlights the role of the Syrian businesspeople.","['Syria', 'class', 'state bourgeoisie', '(neo)patrimonialism', 'business elite', 'conflict', 'political economy']"

The Violent Legacy of a Civil War: Lynching in Post-War Guatemala,"Kruining, Emma Frieda van","['Isla Monsalve, Pablo']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Latijns-Amerikastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Lynchings became a common practice in Guatemala after the signing of the peace accords in 1996.Since lynching has become a source of serious concern in post-war Guatemala, it is of vital importance that the underlying causes of this phenomenon receive a more profound analysis, in order to discern, and consequently address, the root causes of this issue. Due to the often complex and multi-causal nature of violence it is imperative that these problems be tackled from a similar multifaceted perspective. However, the incidence and geographical dispersion of lynching in Guatemala provide clues as to possible factors and conditions of interest as focal points for further analysis.The central hypothesis of this thesis is that widespread loss of social capital and the profound alteration of fundamental social and communal relations have left communities vulnerable to ‘frontier’ practices such as vigilantism and lynching. In the absence of a strong and capable legitimate power, the democratic transition left rural and marginalised communities isolated in an already volatile political and security situation, while pre-existing social disjunctions persisted. In an attempt to re-establish order in a context of psychosocial and collective trauma, perched on the razor’s edge of a near-defunct legal system, violence remained as the only tool in their armoury to settle conflict, exert social control, and impose moral authority.","['Guatemala', 'Lynching', 'Post-War Society', 'Civil War', 'Violence', 'Social Capital', 'Popular Justice']"
Classified Reforms: Social Classes in Syria during the Economic Liberalisation Period prior to the 2011 Uprising,"Ívarsson, Axel Helgi","['Henderson, Christian']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Syrian conflict has entered its eighth year and due to its longevity, strict sectarian lines have formed. The sectarian narrative does not do justice in explaining the origins of the Syrian conflict, which started with peaceful protests in 2011. Such a narrative is based on a static and primordial view of Syria. As a response to that narrative this thesis uses social class theory to examine the years in Syria’s political economy in the years preceding the 2011 uprising. The five years before the uprising are important from an economic, social and political perspective as Syria initiated a transition to a social market economy. The two research question are as follows: How did Syria’s economic liberalisation from 2006 to 2010 change socioeconomic conditions vis-à-vis Syria’s civil uprising in 2011? And what role does social class play in Syria's socioeconomic grievances? The research questions are answered through case studies of the agricultural sector, investments in Syria, and the economic transition’s connection to the 2011 uprising. The case studies’ results are that socioeconomic conditions of lower and middle classes stagnated or worsened in the years before the uprising, displayed in unemployment and a widening wealth gap. Investments patterns in Syria in the economic liberalisation show how profits went those in the upper and ruling classes with ties to the regime. By that, it is concluded that class played a large role in Syria’s socioeconomic grievances that played a partial role in creating circumstances for the 2011 uprising. The explanation is, nonetheless, not sufficient on its own to explain the 2011 uprising. Future research on Syria’s political economy should continue to focus on classes and other social communities in order to provide better explanations for societal changes.","['political economy', 'Syria', 'neoliberalism', 'social class', 'uprising', 'reforms']"

The aim of this document is to answer the following research question: To what extent do Millennials value the fact that a company has a robust CSR strategy and implements social initiatives when applying for a job? After having pointed out Carroll's Responsibility Pyramid and explained that a revisitation of the theory, which rather focuses on the ethical and environmental aspects of CSR, is needed, the questionnaire is presented. The number of overall people who have been surveyed is 242. As part of the analysis, the data that has been produced by the questionnaire is shown. The results showed that generally, Millennials tend to show a genuine interest towards CSR, especially during the process of job application. However, when specifically looking into the answers of the American Millennials population, it seemed as they would be rather interested in their personal achievements.","['Millennials', 'Corporate Social Responsibility', ""Carrol's Responsibility Pyramid"", 'United States']"

Green Growth in Ghana by China’s Cooperation in Renewable Energy Transfer Projects,"Velde, Yvette C. van der","[""d'Hooghe, I.M.A.""]",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"China’s role in renewable energy technology projects in Ghana only implements green growth to a certain extent. This thesis draws the notion of green growth from the definition by the OECD. It is sustained economic growth, while the environment is not harmed and provides services that benefit people’s livelihood. A good mean to foster green growth is investing in renewable energy. Lower developed countries like Ghana do not have the resources to invest in renewable energy as much in comparison to China, who is currently the biggest investor in renewable energy, However, the market for renewable energy in Ghana is highly present and welcoming, which makes it a great opportunity for outside actors to invest in renewables in Ghana. This thesis highlights six renewable energy projects in Ghana where China has been actively involved in, and analysed China’s challenges on its green growth strategy in these projects. Using the theoretical framework, it became apparent that all projects, except the Bui Dam, foster or potentially foster Ghana’s economic development. As the Bui Dam case demonstrate, it does occur that the locals were not adequately taken into account. 1,216 people were forced to resettle, and even though the authority had a resettlement program, it was not adequately implemented. This left some people jobless, homeless and generally, socio-economic speaking better off before the dam was constructed. The issues that the framework make apparent, indicate that it remains challenging for the Chinese government to maintain influence on overseas practices to stress its said green growth policies. This could be due to the numerous actors involved, that makes it hard to establish accountability for bad practices. Consequently, this results in a limited focus on local livelihoods and no regard to the environment. By actively engaging with the community, and implementing social and environmental policies could cultivate the social and environmental pillar of green growth","['Green Growth', 'China', 'Ghana', 'RETT']"
Realist Critique on the American Use of Military Force,"Montvai, Dávid","['Thakur, Vineet']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Realists are said to paint a bleak, pessimistic view of the world. Their paradigm’s emphasis on power, national interest, and anarchy is said to inevitably result in conflict. As such, it seems counterintuitive to think that the most vocal critics of the Vietnam War and Iraq War were realists. Certainly, in public discourse and in the field of political science, there exists a common perception that realists are synonymous with warmongers. However, preeminent realists such as Hans Morgenthau and John Mearsheimer were heavily opposed to the Vietnam War and Iraq War, respectively. The question arises why prominent realists are such vocal opponents of war, while the theory they prescribe to is often conflated with war. This thesis explores the central elements of the realist paradigm in the realist opposition. A qualitative analysis of both the works of Morgenthau and Mearsheimer is done to further contribute to our understanding of the realist lessons on the use of military force and how it can be used to ensure the vital interests and the security of the United States in the 21st century. It finds that that a rational approach is taken within the realist paradigm: The nation's interest lies always in power and all actions should only be taken if its power was to increase or maintained. The Vietnam War and Iraq War both did not pose a threat to the power of the United States. Rather, the United States upset the balance of power by its actions and considerably lost power as defined by realism. With the next decade looking to be under unprecedented strains, the American foreign policy elite would do well to use the valuable insights gained from the earlier wars to steer the country and the world to a just future.","['realism', 'balance of power', 'Morgenthau', 'Mearsheimer', 'national interest', 'Vietnam War', 'Iraq War', 'American military force', 'American intervention']"

Studying these dynamics can offer invaluable insights into the relationship between power and religion in Moroccan society. In this thesis I will examine the development of the Moroccan State’s discourse on Sufism in the 21st century, by analyzing the State’s utterances in the realm of Sufism within the country. In order to present an in-depth analysis, this thesis studies recent scholarly literature on this topic, as well as actual utterances of the Moroccan State in speeches and policy. Moreover, by taking into account the sociohistorical complexities of Sufism and politics in Morocco, I aim at presenting a discourse analysis that is not merely focusing on the present, but also considering the possible connections with the ‘old’ system. Drawing on Foucault’s notion of power and discourse, this thesis also aims at linking the Moroccan State’s powerful position to the discourse on Sufism. I argue that in the 21st century, the Moroccan State’s discourse on Sufism, or sainthood, has become more versatile and complex, due to it is entanglement with political challenges of the 21st century, and its employment under the realm of larger discourses.","['Sufism', 'Politics', 'Morocco', 'Sainthood', 'Islam']"
Regulating for Success: Water Privatisation Experiences in Jordan,"Zanini, Falk","['Henderson, Christian']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis looks at the case of Jordan and argues that corporatisation and privatisation efforts lead to improved success in economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, and social equity for water management when sufficient regulatory capabilities exist. The success of water privatisation is disputed, both politically and academically. So far, evidence is inconclusive. This thesis develops an analytical framework for examining how privatisation may contribute to success in water management. Jordan is running dry, both financially and in terms of water. Given these circumstances, efficient water management is important. Jordan aims to solve its problems by involving the private sector. In applying the framework to Jordan, this work both establishes the validity of the framework and simultaneously shows that involving the private sector can be an appropriate approach for Jordan to tackle its water management issues. This insight has concrete policy implications: smaller scale private partnerships may be more appropriate than larger projects where less regulatory capacity exists. Even as they may have less impact, they can improve efficiency and are easier and less controversial to implement.","['Jordan', 'Privatisation', 'Water', 'Regulation', 'water management', 'PSP', 'PPP']"

This thesis analyzes how neoliberalism has influenced the development of deforestation and agri-business in the Brazilian Amazon. The implementation of neoliberal policies in the 1990’s has been instrumental in the exponential growth of agri-business sectors such as cattle and soy within the Brazilian Amazon. Neoliberalism also reconfigured the primary driver of deforestation from the national government to private enterprise, Brazilian agri-business currently represents the primary driver of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. In addition, federally directed development and conservation policies have also been influential in terms of deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon. Neoliberalism, deforestation, agri-business, development policy and conservation policy will all be engaged in order to assess how neoliberalism has impacted agri-business and deforestation within the Brazilian Amazon.",

It was seen to be building on the concept of Buen Vivir, following a new pathway towards a new vision of society and development. However, in 2013, it all came tumbling down when President Correa decided to terminate the historic initiative. The paradoxical position of the government, both responsible for the implementation and dependent on exploitation for its finance has often been part of the discussions surrounding the initiative. This thesis provides a critical discourse analysis of the official political speeches of Rafael Correa in order to allow for a new understanding of how the Yasuní-ITT initiative failed. This thesis aims to explore the development strategy of Rafael Correa by analysing how is Buen Vivir appropriated in the official political discourse with regards to the Yasuní-ITT initiative.","['Buen Vivir', 'Rafael Correa', 'Critical discourse analysis', 'Yasuní-ITT initiative', 'Political speech', 'Ecuador']"

Modernisation: the formula of success for the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD)?,"Gevelt, Malte van","['Dongen, Teun van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Motivated by the dramatic outcomes of the 2017 German federal election, this thesis essentially investigated how the significant discrepancies in the electoral support of the right-wing populist party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) across the sixteen German federal states in this election can be explained. In particular, it could be observed that the party could attain exceptionally high electoral results predominantly in the eastern states of the country while its electoral performance in large parts of the West was significantly weaker. In the search to explain this pattern, the ‘losers of modernisation’ theory generally appears as a promising approach as it highlights the factor of socio-economic deprivation as one of the main causes for the success of right-wing populist parties, such as the AfD. And, indeed, when evaluating the geographic patterns of the party’s results in the respective election, it stands out that the electoral strongholds of the AfD in the eastern states of Germany appear to be less wealthy and economically productive than their Western counterparts. As a consequence, in order to test the explanatory validity of the ‘losers of modernisation’ theory in understanding the electoral success of the AfD in 2017 German federal election, this thesis poses the following research question: To what extent do factors of socio-economic deprivation explain the electoral success of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) in the 2017 German federal election? In a nutshell, however, the findings of this thesis emphasised that the ‘losers of modernisation’ theory does not possess the explanatory validity to explain the electoral results of the AfD in the 2017 German federal elections and that the factor of socio-economic deprivation had no significant impact on the party’s electoral performance in this respective election.","['Right-Wing Populism', 'Losers of Modernisation', 'Alternative für Deutschland', 'German Politics', 'Socio-Economic Deprivation']"

In this thesis, I will invite you to move into a space-time without the need to take a plane, not even the bus. I will take you for a walk into the ‘androgynous’ that questions the collective representations of gender based on sexuality. In anthropological terms, gender points out the presence of a culturally constructed difference between male and female. More than this, the differences point out a dichotomy between two symbols shaped by the meanings of feminine and masculine principles. The concept of androgynous is the absence of this construction not so much in bodily attributes but more into the psychological domain. Hence, androgyny can offer a third space, proposed for the intersection of multiple spaces instead of binary categories. The implications of such understanding can reshape the relationships between the political, the economic and the historical away from the presupposed hierarchy of genders, and thus empower subjects of marginalization.","['Sexuality', 'Gender', 'Queer theory', 'Foucault', 'representation', 'Anthropology', 'Balinese society', 'Ancient Greece', 'Marxism']"
Finding Religion in Manga and Anime: Spreading Spiritual Thought in the Absence of Traditional Institutions,"Beamer, Keegan","['Pieke, Frank']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"People in Japan have increasingly moved away from institutionalized religion, meaning these institutions are no longer the primary purveyors of religious and spiritual thought in Japan.

This is explored by discussing the ties between secularization, modernization, and changes in Japanese society. It also discusses the role played by the media in forming spiritual thought and analyzes comments from Westerners in online discussion boards about anime. This research finds that spiritual ideas in Japan grew to fit the changing spiritual needs of the people, needs affected by social changes caused by secularization and modernization. Manga and anime, serving as reflections of Japanese society, incorporate these themes and spread them to a large audience both within and outside Japan.

Putting a crack in the wall: Boundary negotiation by Israeli and Palestinian tour guides working in Mejdi’s multiple-narrative tours,"Hansum, Frida","['Azoulay, Rivka']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This case study aims to understand how tourism can contribute to peace, by exploring the ways in which Israeli and Palestinian tour guides negotiate boundaries in a deeply divided society, through working in MEJDI’s multiple-narrative tours. Specifically, it focusses on two types of boundaries that are negotiated: the social and spatial. The interpretive thematic content analysis of 8 semi-structured and in-depth interviews with Israeli and Palestinian tour guides reveals that social and spatial boundaries are negotiated through various processes. The most prominent in the social domain are: creation of a common in-group identity, established frequent contact and friendships, development of trust, and for most an increase in understanding and legitimization of ‘the other side’. Noticeable was that the spatial boundaries were harder to negotiate, because they have been institutionalized throughout the protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The participants do cross the boundaries frequently, by guiding tours to places they usually do not visit and by re-ordering mental maps of safe and unsafe places. However, the wall/fence/checkpoints remain present and those boundaries are harder to negotiate. Ultimately, these findings are discussed and placed in relation to the ‘tourism and peace nexus’, contact hypothesis, social identity theory, theories on boundaries and boundary negotiation, and aim to contribute to the question if tourism can bridge gaps and lead to peace.","['tourism and peace nexus', 'boundaries', 'Israeli-Palestinian conflict', 'boundary negotiation', 'deeply divided societies', 'contact hypothesis', 'social identity theory']"
Chinas role in the COP15 negotiations: Influence of lower-level political actors in China on international climate negotiations,"Gilsbach, Mathis","[""d' Hooghe, I.M.A.""]",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2009 the world looked to Copenhagen in high hopes, as leaders assembled at the COP15 climate summit to discuss a successor to the Kyoto protocol set to expire in 2012. However the talks failed and much blame was put on the Chinese delegation for allegedly having crashed a potential deal. This came as a surprise, as China just shortly before had announced as a sign of goodwill to reduce its carbon intensity by 40 -45% by 2020 and also domestically climate policy gained more and more traction. This discrepancy bears the question of what went wrong at the climate summit or rather how can we understand this gap between the domestic and the international level. This thesis examines whether and argues that competition between lower level political actors over the right direction between economy and ecology is to blame. This is done by using the negotiation theory of two-level games and the model of fragmented authoritarianism to examine the ways lower level actors such as ministries influence decisions at the top level of government and party and by applying these insights to the case study of the COP15 negotiations. In the course of research it became clear that lower-level influence is certainly one explanatory aspect but might on its own not be completely sufficient to conclusively explain the outcome of the negotiations. Nonetheless this research hopefully contributes to the understanding of recent developments in Chinese climate policy and Chinese attitudes towards international negotiations.","['Chinese policy', 'climate negotiations', 'fragmented authoritarianism']"

Addressing Corruption in the Egyptian Land Registry:  A Blockchain-Driven Approach,"Atalla, Salma","['Smith, Karen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Corruption is an epidemic that prevails in all different layers of societies and governments around the world. While there have been continuous attempts aimed at ridding of the phenomenon, yet the war against corruption is yet to be a triumphed one. None of the traditional methods of tackling corruption that were applied by governments, nongovernment actors, or even global institutions such as the World Bank and Transparency International, have ever truly succeeded. Arguably, this can be due to the lack of innovation and the mere following of the traditional steps for battling corruption. Therefore, the paper will aim to illustrate that a new solution can arise from moving towards digitalised governance, in an attempt to reduce corruption in the public sector. Particular focus will be directed towards blockchain technology, as the thesis will contend that the adoption thereof offers the promise of significantly improving the Egyptian land registry, and curbing the corruption that is embedded within it. To verify this hypothesis, the thesis will look at Brazil’s blockchain-based solution and will examine the technology through a diffusion-of-innovation perspective.","['Corruption', 'Digitalisation', 'Egypt', 'Government', 'Blockchain Technology', 'Land Registry', 'Public Sector.']"

CHILE'S ECONOMIC MIRACLE - FOR WHICH STUDENTS?,"Hameeuw, Marie","['Alves Vieira, Eduardo']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis deals with the current inequality levels present in Chile and how these are highly reflected in the education system. In-depth research has been conducted on how the implementation of the neoliberal economic model has created segregation in education. The higher level of education has been used as a case study in order to illustrate the levels of inequality and social discontent present in Chile. Finally, in order to gain better knowledge and overview of the reluctance towards this neoliberal system in education, two student revolutions (2006 and 2011) are taken into analysis. These manifestations have risen due to the unequal access and opportunities in higher education and is seen as a symptom of this. Although Chile has the healthiest economy in the region of Latin America, it is also the country that presents one of the highest levels of inequality in the world, making it an ideal country to analyse. Since the implementation of the economic neoliberal model in 1973, Chile has performed with great economic growth. It has even been labelled as the “Economic Miracle”. Nevertheless, the neoliberal model has had various consequences, which are analysed throughout this paper. Moreover, the economic model in education is put into question as it is benefiting mainly students from higher class families and putting into financial burden those from lower social classes.","['Neoliberalism', 'Inequality', 'Education system Chile', 'Student demonstrations', 'Higher education']"

CHANGING RELATIONS - A BACHELOR THESIS ON CIVIL-MILITARY RELATIONS IN MUBARAK’S EGYPT,"Visser, Pim","['Henderson, Christian']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"To understand the change in civil-military relations in Mubarak’s Egypt between 1991 and 2011, this study approaches civil-military relations theory from the historical, institutional, economic and cultural dimensions to argue how the shift in civil-military relations resulted in the Egyptian military facilitating a transition of power from Mubarak to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. By arguing about the shift in civil-military relations, this study uncovers that facilitating a transition of power as opposed to supporting the regime of Mubarak might have been 20 years in the making. Because of a shift from a clientelist relationship between the military and Mubarak to an internal clientelist relationship, the economic and political rise of Gamal Mubarak and the position the military holds within society based on a cultural-historic perspective, support for Mubarak became unlikely. Furthermore, this thesis adds to the theoretical critique on Huntington’s institutional theory by challenging the limited scope it offers to study civil-military relations.","['Civil-Military Relations', 'CMR', 'Mubarak', 'Egypt', 'Gamal', 'Arab Spring']"

EDUCATION IN CONFLICT AREAS: Educational opportunities for Rio de Janeiro’s marginalized youth,"Huits, Amanda","['Amann, Edmund']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Public security in the city of Rio de Janeiro has been characterized by military intervention in an attempt to contain urban violence and recently, this military intervention model has been proposed to address urban violence in other Brazilian cities, Latin American countries and in the United States (Hoelscher, Norheim-Martinsen 2014, 957)(Fenizola 2018.) To compliment research in the academic field of violence in conflict areas, this paper aims to explore to what extent the potential relation between educational opportunities and violence can enforce or debilitate conflict in the case of Rio de Janeiro's favelas. To analyse this, an innovative theoretical framework is used that combines insights from fhi360's research on the causal relation between educational opportunities and violent conflict, critical race/post colonial theory, John Galtung's Conflict triangle and sustainable peace. Through a multidisciplinary approach and qualitative data analysis, the findings reveal that underlying the visible direct and structural violence shaping public security, is the mechanism of cultural violence that works to justify the direct and structural expressions of violence and indirectly, the militarization of public security. In regards to education, this entail that marginalized youth generally end up in a negative spiral of exclusion that enforces pacification, repression, more violence and eventually less educational opportunities. In response to this model, the paper proposes a method that can reverse the causal cycle of violent conflict and educational opportunities so that sustainable peace may be achieved.","['Education', 'Conflict', 'Educational opportunities', 'Conflict areas', 'Rio de Janeiro', 'Public security', 'Militarization', 'Brazil']"

Chinese and American Media Framing the South China Sea Island Dispute,"Velazquez, Samira","['Schneider, F.A.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The People’s Republic of China has had an increase in economy, population, and military for the past three decades, becoming one of the most dominant powers in Asia. Therefore, the relationship between The United States of America and The People’s Republic of China has been covered extensively by the media, especially when it concerned the territorial dispute of the South China Sea in 2001. The media uses frames to show different perspectives of an event or issue. This thesis concerns itself with how the media in China and the United States framed their position and the South China Sea island dispute. To uncover the frames, a qualitative, inductive frame analysis is conducted on a set of articles from the New York Times, Washington Post, China Daily, and People’s Daily, from the span of 2011 to 2012. Uncovered were seven different frames. Four from the New York Times and Washington Post and three from China Daily and People’s Daily. In The New York Times and Washington Post, the United States was mostly framed as an ally to the smaller and militarily weaker ASEAN States, with a special focus on the Philippines. The second frame established the Chinese position in the dispute, which unlike the United States had a more ‘negative’ connotation. It concentrated on the aggression that came from China’s action within the South China Sea dispute. These frames were the opposite in the Chinese media outlets. China was deemed the peaceful power, while the interference of the United States has led to participant countries becoming more aggressive in their actions against China. While American media, concentrates on presenting the South China Sea dispute as a tense and long-standing issue, Chinese media looks at it, as a new way to increase and deepen regional ties. Both countries shine a positive frame on their actions, while simultaneously casting the other in the role of aggressor or villain.","['South China Sea Island Dispute', 'Framing', 'Comparative frame analysis', 'Chinese Media', 'US Media', 'China', 'United States']"
"Emperor knows best.

One of his most remarkable qualities had been his legislative fervour. Early on, he had completed what would later be called the Corpus Iuris Civilis, incorporating the Codex, the Digesta and the Institutiones. However, in the wake of this Corpus, his reign produced another 155 ‘new laws’ that have not yet received the scholarly attention they deserve. This thesis has taken these Novellae seriously as a corpus of its own and has explored how we should understand this multitude of laws in their socio-political context and how these innovations were anchored in a sixth-century worldview. The Novellae performed a multi-layered balancing act between tradition and innovation, subject and emperor, and being shaped by and shaping society. However, these laws singled out one person whose presence invaded every corner of the text: the emperor. He was ruler of the eternal Roman Empire and Christian father of the people. In the end, he knew what was best.","['Roman', 'Justinian', 'Late Antique', 'Novellae', 'anchoring', 'law', 'representation']"

The Two Faces of Populism: A Characterisation of Populist Discourse and its Relatedness to European Populist Electoral Success,"Escotto García, Gastón","['Augusteijn, Joost']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"By analysing the academic literature on populism, it is clear that there is a lack of consensus in its conceptualisation and classification. Moreover, it is found that an identification of characteristics related to its electoral success is absent. This study examines the extent to which discourse can serve to classify different types of populism on an international level, while also identifying characteristics related to populist electoral success. In so doing, the paper develops a new classification of populism based on discourse by drawing a distinction between positivistic and negativistic populism. After showing that positivistic populist discourse is related to electoral success in Latin America, the paper studies whether similar positivistic populist discourse appears outside the region. To do so, this study focuses on analysing the extent to which Emmanuel Macron’s electoral victory could be related to the use of a positivistic populist discourse in contrast to Marine Le Pen’s negativistic populism. This is done by examining the actors’ rhetoric used during their 2017 presidential campaigns. The findings reveal that it is possible to have an international identification and classification of populism based on discourse; thus, making a strong argument against the conceptualisation of populism as an ideology or as a political strategy. In addition, these findings show that populist presidential electoral victory is not restricted to Latin America, but also that the category of positivistic populism is related to such an electoral success across regions, whereas negativistic populism is not.","['Populism', 'Positivistic Discourse', 'Negativistic Discourse', 'Electoral Success']"
The Effects of Chinese FDI on Brazil´s Economic Development,"Junge, Nick Flemming","['Amann, Edmund']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Bachelor thesis about the effects of Chinese FDI on Brazil´s economic development with representative case studies from Brazil´s petrochemical, - electric power transmission,- and telecommunication industry. Based on a multidisciplinary approach grounded in business, economics, public policy and political economy the hypothesis that Chinese FDI leads to deindustrialization in Brazil via (1) facilitating commodity exports through infrastructure provision and (2) incentivizing the import of manufactured Chinese goods by creating technological dependencies. Key findings include that even though Chinese investment is mostly resource-seeking and conducted by Chinese SOEs in the Brazilian energy sector, the presence of national Champions such as Eletrobras and Petrobras with high innovative capacities might still lead to technological spillovers. So, do complementary technological expertise and Brazilian capital needs. However, a conservative industrial policy paired with an expansionary fiscal policy enabled rent-seeking behavior and culminated in the Lava Jato scandal, which substantially hampered Brazilian absorptive capacities. Especially in the telecommunication sector a clear link between Chinese FDI and Brazilian deindustrialization was evident, as investment incentivized technology imports from China. Nonetheless, the outlook is mixed as academics predict a shift from resource-seeking to efficiency-, and asset-seeking investment, which has yet to materialize but might yield more positive externalities in the future.","['Foreign Direct Investment', 'Brazil', 'China', 'Economic Development', 'FDI', 'Energy Sector', 'Deindustrialization']"

The argument will be based on an assessment of foreign policy making in Ethiopia. The study specifically tries to investigate the influence of Ethiopia’s unique ethnic federal system on foreign policy making. It does so by applying a Neoclassical Realist framework to illuminate the dynamics between the international system and the domestic political settlement in shaping foreign policy responses. By making use of this framework, complex relations can be pointed out. Concluding the paper finds that even though Ethiopia is highly fractured along institutionalized ethnic lines, the foreign policy behaviour is predominantly determined by elitist strategies for regime survival. Nonetheless, the political core elite makes use of ethnic undertones to mobilize resources in their interest and shape a preferable national narrative. It will be shown that foreign policy and the national interest pursued are defined by the core elite to suit their strategies of regime survival","['Ethiopia', 'Foreign Policy', 'Fractured States', 'Ethnic Federalism', 'Neoclassical Realism', 'Horn of Africa', 'EPRDF', 'Zenawi']"

"Bridging the Lebanese Sectarian Divide: Cross-Sectarian Support Mobilization by Hezbollah, 1985 – 2006","Obermeier, Matthias","['Azoulay, Rivka']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Lebanese political system is configured in a way to most accurately represent the country’s extensive religious plurality. Hence, the allocation of political representation is dependent on the demographical size of the individual religious groups. This political accommodation is termed confessionalism, thus, Lebanon is characterized as a confessional democracy. This paper aims towards the analysis of political parties functioning within this system. Hereby, the focus is set upon the question, whether parties act solely in the interest of their religiously affiliated constituency, or whether they attempt to reach out and mobilize popular support across sectarian borders. Exemplified by the case study of Hezbollah, the largest Shi’ite political party in Lebanon, differing strategies for cross-sectarian support mobilization will be displayed, such as the provision of social services, the use of inclusive rhetoric and certain means of mediatizing occurrences to shape a specific, favorable, narrative. Furthermore, Hassan Nasrallah, Secretary General of Hezbollah, is of importance, since his advocating for the so-called “Lebanonization” of the party, alongside the opening up to the political domain, termed Infitah allowed Hezbollah to progress from a militant group, to a dominant political party in Lebanon. Moreover, the strong interdependence between Hezbollah and both the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as neighboring Syria is discussed, since these relationships direct both the agenda of Hezbollah, alongside the entire Lebanese socio-political domain.","['Lebanese Sectarianism', 'Confessional Party System', 'Hezbollah']"
Transition and Implementation of Immigration Laws in Contemporary China,"Lyu, Jiayu","['Schneider, Florian A.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The remarkable economic growth at the beginning of the new millennium enables China to be an attractive destination for international immigrants. In order to administrate the increasing number of foreigners, the Chinese government promulgated a new immigration law in 2012, which was expected to be a more comprehensive, consistent, and effective entity compared to the former legislation. However, by studying the previous researches on migration control in other countries as well as Chinese immigration legislative transition, we found that this transition was trapped in a dilemma. Similar to the UK, the transition has strengthened the restrictiveness over foreigners’ entry, residence, and employment, while this method failed to effectively tackle the illegalities on this field but even deteriorate the situation. Through the case study of African immigrants in Guangzhou city, this thesis argues that the legislative transition has reinforced illegal stay and deteriorate the precarious immigration employment relationship. Besides, aiming to maintain a positive image of Sion-Africana friendship, the central government uses a non-recording strategy, leaving the problems to the local level, which created an oblivion for this group, further enforced their vulnerability.","['China', 'Immigration law', 'Transition']"

Insights from comparative judgments of adjective-noun order in Papiamento-Dutch code-switching,"Voss, Daniëlle Elisabeth","['Parafita Couto, M. Carmen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Latijns-Amerikastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Objectives: This thesis is a replication study of previous work on Spanish-English code-switching (Stadthagen-González, Parafita Couto, Párraga and Damian, 2017) and focuses on comparative judgments, with regard to adjective-noun order in Papiamento-Dutch code-switched utterances. It examines the predictions of adjective-noun order derived from two different theoretical models: the Minimalist Program (Cantone & MacSwan, 2009) and the Matrix Language Framework (Myers-Scotton, 2002). In Dutch, adjectives are prenominal, like ‘zwarte hond’ (‘black dog’), whereas in Papiamento, adjectives are mostly post-nominal, as in ‘kachó pretu’ (literally: ‘dog black’). The Matrix Language Framework (MLF) posits that the word order in code-switched sentences must follow the word order of the Matrix Language (determined by finite verb morphology) (Myers-Scotton, 2002). However, according to Cantone and MacSwan (2009) within the Minimalist Program (MP), the word order depends on the adjective’s language. Methodology and analysis: To evaluate these predictions, 10 monolingual base sentences were modified into 40 code-switched items, consistent with the MP, the MLF, with both or none of the theoretical models. Data was gathered by a 2-Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) task, concentrating explicitly on switches in adjective-noun word order and was analysed using Thurstone’s Law of Comparative Judgment (Thurstone, 1927). Conclusions: Results of the thirty-seven bilinguals that participated in this experiment, indicate that both the language of the verb as well as the language of the adjective are used to determine word order in code-switched sentences and these results do not differ much from those of the similar study regarding Spanish-English bilinguals (Stadthagen-González et.al., 2017). Evidence showed that neither of the two theoretical models can fully account for the acceptability of adjective-noun switches. Implications: A suggestion would be to combine the insights of both the Minimalist Program and the Matrix Language Framework to be able to understand grammaticality in code-switching, as already proposed by Stadthagen-González et.al., (2017).","['adjective-noun order', 'code-switching', 'Dutch', 'Papiamento', ""Thurstone's Law"", 'conflict sites', 'matrix language model', 'minimalist program', 'two-alternative forced choice']"

"How does an understanding of Japanese politics and culture affect the popularity of Ghibli films with a political message, and what does this mean for the efficacy of Japan’s pop-culture diplomacy","Smit, Joosje M.","['Wakefield, Bryce']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis discusses the question of how an understanding of Japanese politics and culture affects the popularity of Ghibli films with a political message, and what this means for the efficacy of Japan’s pop-culture diplomacy. One of the goals of MOFA’s 2006 pop-culture diplomacy is to further the understanding of Japan by disseminating culture, but it does not seem to have the desired effect. To discuss this I have used a reception study using reviews by US and Japanese reviewers. The movies discussed are both by Isao Takahata, one of Studio Ghibli's founders and main directors. The movies are Pom Poko and Grave of the Fireflies. To set the stage I have discussed literature on Ghibli films and domestic politics, cultural heritage and history of Japan. Some key theories are Koichi Iwabuchi's fragrant/odorless theory on culture, Joseph N. Nye's soft power theory and Douglas McGrays's ""Japan's Gross National Cool"", which has been adapted by the Japanese government as their Cool Japan campaign. To test the efficacy of the dissemination of Japanese culture, politics and history to garner understanding overseas, online reviews were used. Using a content analysis on the reviews I have studied the main points and opinions reviewers from both countries have on both movies. Using Koichi Iwabuchi's odorless/fragrant theory I have then explained why there are differences in appreciation of the movies. These differences in appreciation and understanding prove that MOFA's 2006 pop-culture diplomacy does not work well as it does not attain the goal of gaining understanding of Japanese culture.","['Cool Japan', 'Pop-culture', 'diplomacy', 'Studio Ghibli', 'Takahata', 'Reception theory', 'Iwabuchi', 'cultural fragrance', 'soft power', 'Pom Poko', 'Grave of the Fireflies']"

In order to raise awareness of the fact that this is a problem, which needs more attention, this subject can be investigated in different ways. One of these ways is from a linguistic perspective and more specifically through Discourse Analysis. Discourse Analysis focuses on social problems and this method is used to analyze the narratives of black Brazilian YouTubers in order to show that racism and prejudice against black Brazilians is still very common and it can be actually seen on YouTube. For the black community of Brazil, YouTube is primarily used as a means to share their stories and personal experiences regarding racism and prejudice with the outside world. Besides, it is also a way to connect with other people who are also suffering from these social problems. When analyzing their narratives, this thesis will use a structure, invented by, among others, William Labov, a sociolinguist.

Having recently unified Japan, Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched an invasion of the Korean peninsula in 1592. With the fighting deadlocked, a ceasefire was concluded followed by intermittent bilateral peace talks between Japan and Ming China for the next three-and-a-half years, while simultaneous negotiations between Japan and Chosŏn Korea lasted merely nine months. The thesis applies D.G. Pruitt’s ‘readiness theory’ to help explain why both diplomatic channels ultimately collapsed, but also identifies a wide range of contextual factors that undermined the peace process. These factors include: fundamental disagreements over the war’s outcome; problems of miscommunication and deception; a lack of unity on all sides; diplomatic inexperience, and ignorance of the other sides’ political situation. It adopts a trilateral approach in order to understand the conflicting perspectives of the three combatants. Moreover, it reveals significant individual and institutional rivalries within each camp. The thesis draws on primary source materials in classical Chinese and classical Japanese, as well as recently published studies in Japanese and English.","['Imjin War', 'Peace Negotiations', 'Toyotomi Hideyoshi', 'Readiness Theory', 'Japan-Korea Relations', 'Japan-China Relations', 'Japanese Imperialism', 'Ming China', 'Chosŏn Korea', 'Bunroku-Keichō Eras']"

This will be done through the analysis of the political speeches and policies of Julius Nyerere and Jomo Kenyatta as the first presidents of Tanzania and Kenya respectively. The public perception of these leaders and their nation-building projects will also be discussed. It is the conclusion of this thesis that Julius Nyerere used both rhetoric and policy to create a unified Tanzanian identity based on core values which led to political stability throughout his administration and beyond. Meanwhile, Jomo Kenyatta failed to create a unified Kenyan identity through policies and rhetoric that divided the country along ethnic lines. These divisions have caused political instability in Kenya both during and following Kenyatta’s presidency. Ultimately, the creation of a unified national identity played a key role in stability in Tanzania and the lack of unity played a key role in instability in Kenya.","['nation-building', 'Kenya', 'Tanzania', 'Nyerere', 'Kenyatta', 'nationalism']"

A Space for Storytelling: Analysing how The Rawiya Collective use photography to create hybrid spaces,"Whiteley, Hannah","['Omari, Haneen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The thesis paper provides an analysis of the means in which The Rawiya Collective, as the first collective of all female photojournalists, use their photography to create hybrid spaces “in-between” physical and virtual locations. Through the analysis of various exhibitions curated by The Rawiya Collective, this thesis examines the extent to which photography has helped the collective give back a voice to the misrepresented and the oppressed. Since its assemblage in 2009, The Rawiya Collective’s photography has given back a voice to local culture and become the spoken word of media platforms today. As theoretical pillars to this thesis, Spivak’s thinking on the subordinated gender and more specifically the notion of constructed masculinities, is used to guide the first chapter of analysis on Countering Hegemonic Powers. The latter half of the analysis draws from Bhabha’s Location of Culture, providing a structural base for an analogy between his notion of the “in-between” spaces and The Rawiya Collective’s recreation of their own Third Space. Recent literature and research on gender identity is employed to provide a contemporary approach to Spivak’s notion of the gendered subaltern. Recent works from various scholars in media, communications and human geography is used to put into context the notion of a Third Space in today’s world, allowing for a discussion concerning virtual platforms as new spaces for cultural representation. It is through an analysis of what the subordinated gender and its allocated location for existence within The Rawiya Collective’s work, that an understanding of how Spivak and Bhabha’s theories can be applied to a contemporary context.","['rawiya', 'photography', 'locating culture', 'virtual and physical spaces', 'gender identity', 'hybridity', '“in-between” spaces', 'Third Space']"

Voices of Buenos Aires - Lunfardo and Tango; a Dramatic Expression of the Arrabales,"Lammertse, Laura","['Gonzalez, Paz Gonzalez']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Famous tango dancer Carlos Gavito once said, “If you dance your life, you dance better”. This quote beautifully reflects the main motive in of this thesis, namely the existence and development of the tango. The Argentine tango can be considered to be Argentina’s addition to the world’s experiences of dance. Over the past few decades, the tango transformed from a indecent form of dance straight out of the brothels with men and women rubbing their bodies together to a classy and elegant dance inducing an image of upper class, with both men and women dressed in proper evening dress (Trio Garufa). As the tango develops throughout the years, so does Lunfardo. Lunfardo is considered to be the slang of the outer skirts of Buenos Aires, and frequently used within the lyrics of the tango. How did these two phenomena connect? The purpose of this thesis is to research and understand the development of tango and the use of Lunfardo within the lyrics of the tango. By use of a theoretical framework and an implementation of these findings in the comparison of different tango lyrics, I will try to answer the question “What function did Lunfardo serve within the Tango?”. To understand what function Lunfardo served within the tango, it is needed to have thorough analysis into different literature is needed. The theoretical framework will give an overview of the history of tango and Lunfardo, and the following case study will function as an example of the two trends in the history of tango lyrics writing.","['Lunfardo', 'Argentina', 'Tango', 'Arrabales', 'Lyrics']"

Gender-Assignment Strategies within the Bilingual Determiner Phrase: Four Spanish-English Communities Examined,"Królikowska, Marta Anna","['Parafita Couto, M. Carmen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Latijns-Amerikastudies (BA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on gender-assignment strategies in Spanish-English mixed nominal constructions in which nouns come from English and determiners come from Spanish. Spanish has gender-agreement for determiners (el/los/uno/estos for masculine, la/las/una/estas for feminine gender), as well as also other types of agreement, for instance with adjectives. English does not possess gender-agreement in the least. This conflict site where grammars of the two languages have conflicting rules, is therefore interesting to examine. Previous studies report that bilingual speakers use different strategies when assigning gender-agreement in code-switched Determiner Phrases (DPs) where the determiner comes from a gender-carrying language and the noun from a language without gender. Valdés Kroff, in his study (2016) found evidence in favour of the default strategy proposed earlier by Poplack, Pausada & Sankoff (1982). He examined mixed DPs in the Bangor Miami Corpus. He found that Spanish determiners were almost all masculine gendered and used as a default. A second strategy proposed by Liceras et al. (2008) suggests that translation equivalent of the noun will determine the gender of the Spanish determiner in Spanish-English bilingual speech. A third possible strategy, found by Parafita Couto et al. (2016), is that the gender-assignment in Basque-Spanish language pair is determined by a phonological cue. This means that nouns ending on-a, mostly trigger the Spanish feminine la determiner in mixed DPs. The aim of the present study is to determine which of these strategies are mostly used in each community and to look if, and how, these communities differ. The bilingual speech production of 104 participants were examined through a Map Task, across four Spanish-English communities: Pennsylvania State University (PSU) (USA), San Juan, (Puerto Rico, USA), El Paso (Texas, USA) and Granada (Spain)). Results showed, that in bilingual DPs, Spanish masculine determiner occurred more frequently as a default strategy, than the analogical strategy in both San Juan and PSU. Interestingly, in Granada and El Paso, both the default and the translation equivalent strategies are almost equally used. In conclusion, these bilingual communities with the same language pair, have different strategies for gender-assignment in bilingual DPs. As suggested by Valdés Kroff (2016), this can be explained by specific community norms that result in linguistic variation across communities.","['gender-assignment', 'code-switching', 'determiner phrase', 'bilingualism', 'Spanish-English', 'gender-assignment strategies']"

With Specific Reference to the Pāśupatasūtra and the Skandapurāṇa","Jonker, Arinde Lucianne","['Bisschop, Peter C.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis aims at gaining a deeper understanding of the relation between yoga and death in the early Śaiva tradition of the Pāśupatas, based on two Pāśupata texts: the Pāśupatasūtra and the Skandapurāṇa. The thesis presents an analysis and interpretation of textual passages that treat the last moment of the life of a Pāśupata ascetic in order to find out whether or not his death can be interpreted as a form of ‘self-induced yogic death’. The inquiries start with introducing the philosophical and religious environment wherein the Pāśupatasūtra and the Skandapurāṇa were written. After that, the relation between yoga and death in upaniṣadic and epic sources is treated, thereby referring to early manifestations of utkrānti (rising upwards, ‘yogic suicide’). The pivot of this thesis is a translation, analysis and discussion of fragments of the Pāśupatasūtra and the Skandapurāṇa. With regards to both texts I discuss the possibility of interpreting the death of a Pāśupata as a self-induced yogic death. This is followed by a conclusion. Following the analysis of the primary sources, it will become clear that yoga and death stood in a much closer relation than one might expect; this thesis claims that the death of a Pāśupata can be interpreted as an early form of self-induced yogic death.","['Pāśupata', 'Śaivism', 'yoga', 'utkrānti', 'death', 'Sāṃkhya', 'Skandapurāṇa']"

Taking issue with common approaches to Michizane and his writings, I deal with the material in four different ways in order to show the problems inherent in these practices, while simultaneously attempting to provide alternative inroads to Michizane's oeuvre. These four issues are: 1. the discrepancies between modern and premodern 'poethood', which usually remain unquestioned but are here complicated by zooming in on Michizane the scholar and the official instead; 2. the limited scope of biographers, for whom the period in Sanuki central in this essay is peripheral to Michizane's identity; 3. a strongly selective attitude towards Michizane's writings, which I avoid by taking the entire oeuvre attributed to one single year; and 4. what I call the 'biographical fallacy', where biographers take details found in Michizane's oeuvre about his life at face value. Instead, I understand his literary compilation as a consciously subjective collection of works that was designed to portray a desirable Self. By focussing on Michizane's use of the three different personae - that of poet, scholar, and administrative official - I show how the original compositions compiled into one new work are made to take on new meaning, which act, rather than a portrayal of historical fact, constitutes a politically motivated act intended to convey a specific self-representational message, disseminated by Michizane at the time, just before the exile to Kyushu, when his position at court was rapidly deteriorating, and which can thus be seen as one bid in the political game in the high echelons of court power.","['persona', 'Japan', 'Heian period (794-1185)', 'Sugawara no Michizane (845-903)', 'kanshi', 'self-representation', 'Sanuki province', 'literature and the political', 'biographical fallacy', 'historical notions of poetry']"

The research takes into consideration the experience of three support groups (Chikatetsu Sarin Jiken Higaisha no Kai, Kanariya no Kai and RSC) that will be used as case studies to analyze the evolution and the impact they had both on victims’ lives and information media. It aims to investigate the role of NPOs and victims’ group activities in influencing public opinion regarding victims’ redressing issues. Furthermore, it intends to explore victims’ struggle against the proliferation of New Religious Movements derived from the disbanding of Aum Shinrikyō and constituted mainly by its former members, such as Hikari no Wa 光の環 and Aleph アレフ, which are suspected of harboring the same doctrines that led Aum to be a danger for Japanese society. In doing so, victims used memory, both individual and collective, as a tool to make their case and highlight their instances even when the attention towards the Aum affair declined in Japanese media. Memorial constructions regarding the incidents, commemorative events, documentaries and victims’ groups’ activities accounts established a legacy that goes beyond the individual experience as a victim or a perpetrator, rather producing a collective instance of victimhood.","['Japan Society', 'Victimhood', 'New Religious Movement', 'Aum Shinrikyo', 'NPO', 'victim']"

The same can be said for Costa Rica, where the street art movement is currently thriving. Because street art is able to combine global and local experiences, it, therefore, makes every urban space unique. This thesis investigates how street art in the urban spaces of Costa Rica represents concerns of the public by analyzing murals in the cities of Jacó and San José. With the theory of activism and a close analysis of these murals, it is revealed that global themes are incorporated into the murals using local representations, furthermore, street art is a form of activism. Murals found in the tourist city of Jacó relies heavily on environmental themes, which mirror and romanticize the local nature, animals, and indigenous peoples. The street art in the capital city, San José, is, in contrast, less romanticized and more confrontational in its nature. In both cities the themes of the murals are closely related to local experiences and perceptions of issues and concerns. Ultimately, the street art in Jacó and San José actively address concerns in two different manners giving an indication of the diversity and versatility of representations in street art in Costa Rica.","['street art', 'murals', 'graffiti', 'Costa Rica', 'activism']"

In it I analyze the Portuguese narrative of colonial history and its place in the Portuguese identity. In order to best understand the development of Portuguese Imperial Nostalgia, and how it affects the Portuguese perspective about its place in Europe and the World, this thesis is divided into three chapters. The first chapter is a critical reading of the works of Gilberto Freyre, introducing and analyzing his theory and how it became central to the Lusotropicalism embraced by the ‘Estado Novo.’ The second chapter focus on Nostalgia and the influence of Fernando Pessoa’s works, analyzing how the Salazarism’s Lusotropicalism was adapted into a contemporary form of imperial nostalgia within the context of the democratization of Portugal. The last chapter discuss how the narrative of imperial nostalgia affects Portugal both internally and externally, showing how imperial nostalgia became central to Portuguese society and identity, as the official narrative recentered Portuguese self-perception around the poetic nostalgia of their past glories and empire. Consequently, this national nostalgia is so prevalent that even when rejected by a percentage of the population, it still lead many others to embrace their connection to their former empire. This created a division in focus that makes Portugal, despite the country being an integral part of Europe, unwilling to truly embrace the unification and aspirations of the continent.","['Portugal', 'Imperial Nostalgia', 'Colonialism']"
La paradoja inclusiva Efectos a corto y largo plazo de las políticas públicas para la educación superior en Colombia,"Constantinescu, Mara","['Inzaurralde, Gabriel']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,es,"Al analizar las posibilidades de inclusión en el sistema educativo y la eficacia de las políticas públicas que la propician o dicen propiciarla, el programa Ser Pilo Paga ofrece una perspectiva integral de la complejidad del sistema educativo en Colombia y la estrecha causalidad que establecen factores exteriores al ámbito educativo sobre el mismo. Ser Pilo Paga es sin duda el programa más amplio y con mayor impacto sobre la educación en Colombia, con un presupuesto mayor que cualquier iniciativa similar anterior. Unos 40.000 jóvenes colombianos han tenido la oportunidad de acceder a instituciones de educación superior acreditadas como de alta calidad que les hubieran resultado inasequibles de no ser por la implementación de este programa. Una descripción detallada del programa refleja la implicación de todos los actores principales del sistema educativo colombiano, garantizando el carácter inclusivo al menos desde el punto de vista ejecutivo –participan en él todos los actores importantes por parte de las instituciones del Estado y las instituciones de educación superior. Como se ha visto, es de destacar el aumento considerable en cuanto a ingreso al sistema de la educación superior de la población desfavorecida, con un salto del 36% al 69% después de las primeras dos etapas del programa. Sin embargo, beneficiando de manera individual a un número limitado de miembros de los grupos desfavorecidos, el programa, que emplea un porcentaje considerable del presupuesto dedicado a la educación, falla en atender las necesidades de la población en su integridad. Esta falla se traduce sobre todo en inequidad de oportunidades para miembros del mismo grupo socioeconómico, al crear una nueva brecha que se puede profundizar a futuro si no se implementan programas complementarios. Esta inequidad en el 58 Mara Constantinescu otorgamiento de recursos públicos profundiza también el desequilibrio entre instituciones de educación superior privadas y públicas, debilitando a estas últimas y creando una desventaja difícil de superar sin intervención estatal. Es importante aquí estimular el debate público sobre el concepto mismo de “acceso a educación de calidad para todos”, garantizado por la constitución de la república, y las modalidades a través de las cuales debería ser implementado por las instituciones del Estado. En ese sentido, un proceso de debate y toma de decisiones que tome en cuenta el valor de la educación como bien común –cuyas líneas de desarrollo teórico se repasan en el capítulo I–, y que vaya más allá de soluciones de urgencia o a corto plazo, involucrando a todos los actores sociales, sería más que deseable en el ámbito social. Un nuevo paradigma de la educación superior podría reequilibrar el rol de las IES públicas e IES privadas, estableciendo reglamentaciones que las situen en igualdad de oportunidades para futuro desarrollo.","['Colombia', 'educacion superior', 'politica publica', 'inclusion']"

All Roads lead to China - The geo-economic implications of Chinese Infrastructure Investment in Myanmar,"Flore, Phillip","[""Hooghe, I.M.A. d'""]",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"With the end of the financial crisis, China launched multiple infrastructure investment projects in Asia, Africa and Latin America. This display of global engagement has led to an ongoing debate among scholars and policy makers concerning the significance of geo-economics. This study aims to shed some light into this debate and to determine the geo-economic implications of Chinese infrastructure investments in Myanmar. To this end, the research question for this thesis is as follows: How are infrastructure investment and its effects utilised as a tool of economic diplomacy to produce geo-economic gains for China in Myanmar? To answer the research question, the effects and geo-economic implications are analysed through a qualitative policy and discourse analysis, as well as the examination of data and the effects of infrastructure investment and its geo-economic implication over time. The study shows, that the effects of the infrastructure projects are nurturing new interdependencies and dependencies, increasing the vulnerability of Myanmar towards China, who can utilise these dependencies as political leverage. Further research can be undertaken to identify similar patterns in the relationship of China and other nations, as well as the role of infrastructure investment as economic diplomacy tool.","['China', 'Geo-economics', 'Infrastructure Investment', 'Myanmar']"

The Politics of Perception: A Comparative Analysis of the Perspectives on the Role of the European Union in the Cyprus Dispute,"Zandstra, Lily","['Weyenberg, Astrid van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Cyprus Dispute of 1974 has never been resolved. The two majority communities of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots live under divided terms, however, there is currently little physical violence between the two communities. Efforts to resolve the conflict have proven stubbornly unsuccessful. The island of Cyprus is of global geostrategic significance and has a complicated and rich history concerning identity. Most of the literature on the Cyprus Dispute concerns the peace efforts of the United Nations and the islands guarantors Greece, Turkey and The United Kingdom. This thesis, however, forms a comparative analysis of the different perceptions of the Turkish and Greek Cypriot people at both a national and local level, analysing the involvement of the European Union in the Cyprus Dispute. The paper is based on research of a multidisciplinary approach of culture, politics and history. Qualitative data from journalistic articles and statements from political representatives have been analysed to interpret the perspectives of both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. Concluding remarks draw on the role of the European Union in the Cyprus Dispute. It will reveal how identity issues and the recognition of two distinct identity groups is paramount and often overlooked by the European Union. Failure to recognise these dynamics has played a significant part in sustaining the hostilities between the divided communities.",
Reconciliation by Shifting the Violence: the Effect of Rwanda's Reconciliation Policies on the Conflict in Eastern Congo,"Toor, Femke van","['Smith, Karen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper explores the effects of the reconciliation policies in Rwanda that have been implemented after the genocide in 1994 on the ongoing conflict in eastern DRC. An overview of the ethnic tension that eventually caused the genocide is given in order to give an understanding of the ethnic relation between the Hutus and the Tutsis. The events of the genocide also show what caused the difficult relation between the international community and the current Rwandan government and how the conflict shifted borders. In the aftermath of the genocide, the Rwandan government led by Paul Kagame, implemented policies to create a national narrative and reject the ethnical division that caused the genocide, but at the same time, the national narrative clearly identifies the victims and the predators of the genocide. Even though the ethnic issues are seemingly resolved in Rwanda, ethnicity still plays an important role in the conflict in Eastern Congo. Hutu refugees are as a collective regarded as the predators of the genocide and they are still fighting Tutsi rebel groups who are supported by Kagame and his RPF forces.","['Rwandan Genocide', 'Paul Kagame', 'RPF', 'Eastern Congo', 'Ethnic Conflict', 'Reconciliation Policies', 'Rebels', 'DRC', 'Rwanda']"

How is social coherence in democratic societies pursued if linguistic insults drive a wedge between citizens? Recent attempts to ban hate speech, court cases on Holocaust denials, and the condemnation of comedy expressions reveal the vibrant intersection of freedom of expression and hate speech. With the aim of providing an outlook on the juridical, political, and ideological future of EU member-states, this thesis investigates some of the implications of attempts to legally enforce speech. Focusing on the prosecution of Geert Wilders since 2014, I argue that the victim of hate speech is always influenced by a historicity that exceeds the present, regardless of context. Furthermore, I will state that the roots of insults lie in the antagonisms of modern democratic societies that encapsulate latent enmity and a lack of tolerance. I therefore propose to address hurt through public debate and not law, since the latter is a mere regulatory instrument of human behavior. Finally, the criminalization of speech narrows the space for debate and ignores and reinforces societal antagonisms: the deep-rooted cause of distrust and conflict that is once to blossom.","['Freedom of Speech', 'Democracy', 'Hate Speech', 'European Union', 'Geert Wilders', 'Insult', 'Legal enforcement', 'Racism', 'Discourse', 'Antagonism']"

A large component of this unease is the anti-Mainland sentiment, aimed at both the government and Chinese immigrants and tourists. Additionally, the prevalence of the Mandarin language and the Simplified Chinese script has increased, in local schools, on television, in the workplace and in the streets. Since both the language issues of Hong Kong and the socio-political issues associated with the Mainland Chinese influence have gotten increasing attention, it makes one wonder whether there is a form of correlation and plausible causation between these two factors. Thus, using news articles, social media, a survey and youth responses this paper will attempt to answer the question; Do attitudes regarding the Mandarin and Cantonese language in Hong Kong reflect a political stance vis-à-vis Mainland China and Hong Kong?","['Hong Kong', 'Mainland China', 'Cantonese', 'Mandarin', 'Politics']"

This time it was at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Nicolas Cruz killed 17 people and injured another 14 people with an assault rifle he legally obtained. As mass shootings are a common occurrence in the United States, reactions to one are often predictable and changes regarding gun control are lacking. However, in recent years new actors, in the form of social media, have come to play a role in the aftermath of mass shootings. In the case of the Parkland shooting, social media played a role in crisis communication and in creating both an online and offline activist movement called the Never Again movement. Through different activist efforts, this movement is trying to achieve the implementation of sensible gun laws. By analysing the current gun debate and gun problem in the United States, and by researching the role of social media in the Never Again movement, this thesis will be able to assess the impact of social media on the Parkland shooting and its aftermath.","['social media', 'online activism', 'mass shooting', 'crisis communication', 'Never Again movement', 'gun control', 'slacktivism']"
Masculinidades: revisitando o sertão na literatura e cinema brasileiros,"Kersbergen, Seger","['Brandellero, Sara']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,pt,"Nesta tese, proponho estudar Boi Neon (2015), o filme mais recente do diretor brasileiro Gabriel Mascaro, e Nossos Ossos (2013), do escritor brasileiro Marcelino Freire. Na forma de “close reading” se analisará como se reconstrói e se reinventa o sujeito masculino na sociedade moderna, na qual surge uma convivência conflitiva de diversas formas de masculinidade(s) que se negociam interna e externamente dos sujeitos. As obras estão assombradas (“haunted”) pela tradição regional. Estar assombrado significa o quanto a sensação de ser é sempre perseguida ou assombrada por algo outro que impossibilita descrever, compreender ou fechar a existência em categorias definidas. Desestabiliza as noções de um eu independente e coerente. Surge, então, um potencial deconstrutivo de ruptura e abertura, oferecendo um espaço no qual “Outros” conceptuais e textuais podem emergir. Tanto Bezerra (2014) como Angeli e Machado (2017) relacionam Heleno, o protagonista de Nossos Ossos, ao herói clássico da antiguidade, na qual os amores masculinos se reconheciam oficialmente. Na época moderna, a homossexualidade de Heleno é um fator identitário problemático. Carvalho e De Moraes (2017), tratam Boi Neon a través do conceito da perspectiva do arquivo. Segundo eles, o arquivo, como conjunto de rastros que são ressignificados, é confrontado por uma masculinidade multifacetada, desafiando o paradigma heteronormativo estabelecido. Porém, é importante especificar a dinâmica e transformações da masculinidade em relação à tradição regional. Os protagonistas, ambos nordestinos ambulantes, transitam pela região do Nordeste. Há neles uma constante interferência identitária da tradição passada nordestina que notamos em peças canônicas da região do Nordeste, como Vidas Secas (1938) e Os Sertões (1902). Boi Neon e Nossos Ossos trazem novas representações da masculinidade tradicional nordestina, desafiando a criação de estereótipos e imagens fixas que atravessam o imaginário regional e nacional. Confrontam a tendência em direção a uma normatividade rígida, criando novas verdades que desafiam os modelos hegemônicos da masculinidade, feminidade e a repressão desta ordem dominante.","['Masculinity', 'Brazil', 'Literature', 'Cinema', 'sertão', 'masculinidade', 'literatura', 'Brasil']"

Their individual dominance can be viewed through the wider phenomenon of increasingly personalised leadership throughout the world. Politics is viewed and covered through the lens of individual politicians, instead of political parties. Headlines are dominated by Trump and May, not by the Republicans or the Conservatives respectively. Furthermore, populism has also been a key aspect in modern politics, especially in Latin America where the rise of leftist-populist governments, often called the “Pink Tide”, has dramatically reshaped regional politics (Remmer 2012, 949). Similar populist movements have only come to the US and Europe far more recently. This essay will analyse the wider context of the left in Latin America, both Lula and Bachelet individually, their respective political parties, and populism as a theory. This will be done through a critical literature review and comparative analysis. The aim is to answer the question, to what extent have individual leaders replaced political parties as the dominant force within politics.","['Politics', 'Latin America', 'Lula', 'Michelle Bachelet']"

(DE)CENTRALIZATION: THE RUSSIAN FEDERAL SYSTEM SINCE 1991.,"Gieremits Zeinentine, Zant Ntarie","['Wilbrink, Hans']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis paper researches and interprets the Russian federal system with the intention of observing it’s functioning throughout recent history. Foremost, the paper identifies that the Russian federal system has experienced two radically different political environments, one of extensive decentralization and one of strong centralization, all within the historical experience since the inception of the modern Russian Federation (1991- ). Hence, the thesis statement and research question try to capture this phenomenon by asking: How do both centralization & decentralization impact the functioning of the Russian federal system? This question observes that there is an interplay between significantly centralizing and decentralizing a federal system, indeed, this paper attempts to observe the effects of both orientations in their most expressed form. The main intention being, to create a credible analysis of the two phenomena and the specificities of the two processes, in distinct time periods. The topics of federal ties, asymmetry, ethno-federalism and separatism are discussed distinctly in each wave of centralization and decentralization due to the persistence of these issues based on our scope of research and the time periods observed. Most importantly, these are hereditary issues spanning from eras that preceded the formation of the Soviet Union and issues that developed during the socialist era. In essence, in order to properly observe the Russian federal system, we mostly focus on the legacies of ethnic conflict, regional inequality and separatism as elements which are the product of and influence the processes of centralization and decentralization.","['Decentralization', 'Centralization', 'Federalism', 'Federal assymetry', 'Ethno-federalism', 'Federal ties', 'Separatism', 'Federal subjects']"

In the light of post-modern discourse, the concept of gender identity has been hotly debated and deconstructed, leading to the conclusion that there is nothing inherently natural about gender; it is instead the byproduct of social, cultural, political, and economic factors. The following thesis analyzes the ways in which feminine identity is crafted through the powerful impact of the male gaze, biopower through the media, and voyeuristic desire. Through an in-depth analysis of two case studies − one focusing on the carnival in Rio de Janeiro, and another one on Brazilian magazine covers − the thesis assesses the extent to which the male gaze impacts feminine identity in 21st century Brazilian society. The main findings suggest that feminine identity in Brazil is created and reaffirmed through the male gaze and voyeuristic pleasure, as exemplified by events such as the carnival in Rio as well as an analysis of Brazilian magazine covers. The thesis concludes that the male gaze and biopower have repercussions on gender norms in Brazilian society, as they present feminine and masculine identities in oppositional terms, thus reinforcing them as separate categories: masculine as active and feminine as passive.","['hyperfemininity', 'masquerade', 'gender identity', 'Brazil', 'biopower']"

Changing Tides The Green Party in 21st Century Germany,"Verhoeven, Michael","['Weyenberg, Astrid van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The left-right binary as a concept is often too narrow and confined to serve as an explanation for complex political developments and changes. There are too many variables and incremental differences between parties to place them on a spectrum solely based on a one-dimensional left-right understanding. Introducing a more detailed measurement is going to be challenging, to act as a substitute for the reductionist concept of left and right, as it is well rooted in the political discourse. In the case of the Green party in Germany, with the help of sophisticated variables such as the economy, migration politics and security, it is possible to delineate the party during a fixed time span. The analysis of the election programs from the last three national elections in Germany show that the Greens have not seized right-wing values but have toned down their commitment to left ones. There are clear indicators across all three assess variables that demonstrate a move away from the party’s traditionally socialist stance towards a less nuanced position of the center. Thus, an abandoning process can be detected and analyzed, which infers closer ties to center voters. To learn more about this development of the party, it is necessary to analyze more documents by the Greens like further election programs but also speeches and other statements as well as material about the party by political scientists or the party representatives’ behavior in the Bundestag. However, these endeavors go far beyond the scope of this thesis. Regarding the origins of the discovered shift, it is unclear, if it has occurred due to the initial entrance of the AfD or other major events that influenced the political sphere in Germany like the tragic terror attacks, or if the shift originated from an intrinsic motivation. The change in leadership, from a mixed constellation to solely “Realos” at the helm may indicate a long-term development of the party with a greater emphasis on pragmatism and flexibility than fundamental values. In the aftermath of the breakdown of the “Jamaika” talks, the Greens’ reputation and standing has not deteriorated as much as the FDP’s. Therefore, the trajectory of the Greens is difficult to predict (Spiegel Online 2017). The results of the aforementioned elections for the Green party are non-linear. In 2009 the Greens gained 10.7 percent of all the votes, followed by a drop in the next election with 8.4 percent on a domestic level. In the 2017 election they managed to recover and received 8.9 percent of the total votes (Statistisches Landesamt Baden-Württemberg 2017). When comparing the results with the SPD who went from 23 percent in the 2009 election to 25.7 percent in 2013 to 20.5 percent in 2017, the Greens managed to stabilize their party and avoid a further drop (Statistisches Landesamt Baden-Württemberg 2017). While comparing the results the observation that the Greens have benefitted from their shift in policies is partially correct. How the party is going to fare when populist parties such as the AfD continue to amass support and influence is a question that does not have to be limited to the Greens but can be asked of all major parties. German politics are experiencing turbulences and it remains to be seen when a more serene course is chosen. Consequently, public speeches delivered with such emotion and conviction, as the aforementioned speech by Cem Özdemir, may not remain an exception.","['Greens', 'left', 'right']"
The Additive Influence of Bilingualism on Educational Third Language Acquisition,"Jong, Roza de","['Grijzenhout, Janet']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study explores the influence of bilingualism on the process of educational third language acquisition (TLA) among adolescents who have previously acquired proficiency a second language. Within contemporary research, it is frequently suggested that bilingualism positively influences the process of TLA, since bilinguals are familiar with language processing strategies and have almost certainly developed multicompetence (Cenoz, 2003; De la Fuente & Lacroix, 2015; Ter Kuile, Veldhuis, Van Veen, & Wicherts, 2011). This study takes into consideration the concept of ‘focus on multilingualism’, which emphasizes the multilingual speaker, their whole linguistic repertoire, and the social context when analyzing TLA (Cenoz, 2013). In order to examine whether previous acquired linguistic knowledge by bilinguals benefits the process of TLA within an educational setting, a survey was conducted among 29 bilingual students who are currently acquiring Korean as an additional language at Leiden University. The results obtained from the surveys are divided into three groups, based on in which stage in life the respective students have acquired proficiency in their additional language. The conducted survey consists of 20 questions regarding the students’ perspectives towards the effect of their age-specific bilingualism on their process of acquiring Korean as a L3, in terms of learning grammar, pronunciation and words. The data obtained from this study demonstrates three unexpected findings, which have not been previously indicated within the research field of TLA and bilingualism. Firstly, students who acquired proficiency in a second language before the age of 10 are more positive about the influence of bilingualism on acquiring the appropriate pronunciation in the process of TLA, than about the impact of bilingualism on learning grammatical structures. Secondly, speakers of at least one non-Germanic language were more positive about the influence of bilingualism on learning grammar and pronunciation, as opposed to speakers of only Germanic languages. Thirdly, students who have been exposed to two or more languages between birth and the age of 4 are the most positive about the influence of bilingualism on learning words. This study argues that early bilinguals are more likely to demonstrate cross-linguistic influence between their acquired languages, causing them to be more positive about the experience of learning an additional language. Subsequently, this study suggests that the process of cross-linguistic influence between two typologically different languages is likely to positively influence student’s perspectives on learning an additional typologically different language. Finally, this study proposes that speakers of bilingual FLA are positive about the influence of their bilingualism on learning words, since they perceive their prior linguistic knowledge as the necessary experience to accomplish proficiency in an additional language.","['bilingualism', 'third language acquisition', 'educational language acquisition', '‘focus on multilingualism’', 'Korean']"

How do states’ nation-building practices and their often accompanying assimilationist state policies influence this decision? This research delves into these questions by means of a comparative analysis between two state-minority relationships, that of the Amazigh minority with the Moroccan state and the Kurdish minority with the Turkish state. Whereas both minorities have been subject to their states’ nation-building endeavours, the Amazigh minority unlike the Kurdish minority has not resorted to violence as a response to this. Both factors related to the state and factors to do with minorities’ ability to mobilize have been shown to influence this decision. Based upon an historical analysis of these factors for both cases, the findings of this research strongly suggest that conditions of political exclusion and discrimination, heavy state interference in both the public and private domain, and violent state repression specifically aimed at an ethnic minority can explain the resort to ethnic political violence of minorities. At the same time, the findings call into question the explanatory capability of economic factors with regard to the rise of ethnic political violence.","['nation-building', 'ethnic political violence', 'nationalist state policies', 'armed mobilization', 'ethnic minority', 'Kurdish', 'Amazigh', 'Morocco', 'Turkey']"
"The Street Belongs to Women, Too! A Gendered Analysis of the Egyptian Revolution and its Influence on Gender Roles for Women in Egypt","Shawki, Soraya","['Strava, Cristiana']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"During the Egyptian Revolution in 2011, protesters and dissident behaviour were severely condemned by agents of the state. Among the protesters were women who were subjugated to gender-specific violence to the criticism of many Egyptians. As awareness of misconduct towards women grew during the Egyptian revolution, it can be argued that the revolution also instigated a shift in thinking about the role of women in Egyptian society, since it opened up a new space for women to express themselves in the process of self-definition. Therefore, I will argue that a gendered analysis of the revolution will help us understand resistance better while interrogating the gender-dynamics in revolutionary Egypt. Hence, I will investigate how the revolution contributed to a shift in the construction of gender roles for women in Egypt. The research problem is understanding how the previously assigned gender roles, framed by nationalist ideologies, played a role in the way women were treated during the public protests. In order to answer this question, I will focus on Egypt under Mubarak and under the SCAF who reigned until 2012. Secondly, I will investigate the role of the state, its patriarchal character and its adherence to a security regime. Thirdly, I will analyse how women protesters were changing the status quo by their acts of protest and how it provoked a different way of thinking about women. The latter, has been aided by female graffiti artists too who used their graffiti as a way of 'speaking back'. This will be contextualised by an analysis of a selection of graffiti made by women during the Egyptian Revolution.","['gender roles', 'women', 'egyptian revolution', 'mubarak', 'patriarchy', 'graffiti', 'protest', 'national identity', 'femininity']"
Reciprocity and Neoliberalism - The Problem of Slavery in the Cocoa Sector in Ghana,"Amas, Cynthia","['Wal-Rémy, Anne Marieke van de']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research is based on the ‘new’ or ‘modern’ form of slavery, looking specifically at child labour as a form of ‘new’ slavery. The topic of ‘modern’ slavery is of immense importance, as it persists in economies worldwide as a tool to maximize profit while keeping labour costs low. The thesis attempts to disclose the relationship between child labour as a form of ‘new’ slavery in the context of neoliberalism and reciprocity. Neoliberalism, which describes the liberal market system, was brought to Ghana through Structural Adjustment Programs, which, instead of creating opportunities of entrepreneurships, worsened the situation for many workers and gave incentives to exploit labourer and children for profit maximization. While the latter reflects the global level of impacts on child labour, reciprocity is a custom that helps understanding the local (national) perspective of it. Also, the traditional custom of reciprocity that is a crucial part of Ghana’s society, has negative impact on the increase of child labour, as it can be stated that some parents abuse their children to fulfil duties that hinder them in their educational and personal development.

Eventually, the aim of this research is to assess whether the resurgence of the Muslim Brotherhood in the form of a political party, the FJP, democratically elected by the majority of the Egyptian people, after the 25 January Revolution has resulted in adequate changes to one of the main objectives of the Arab Spring, and ultimately, of the Revolution. The following research question has thus been formulated: To which extent has the Muslim Brotherhood addressed the human rights conditions in Egypt in the aftermath of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution? The human rights that this thesis wil specifically regard in this context are the right to freedom of thought, consciousness, and religion and women’s rights.","['Arab Spring', '2011 Egyptian Revolution', 'human rights', 'Muslim Brotherhood', 'freedom and justice party', ""women's rights"", 'minority rights']"

It not only analyzes in what ways the anime media mix of Yuri!!! on ICE functions as a system, in which media content is dispersed and consumed in different media forms, but it also explores the ways Yuri!!! on ICE is experienced as a world of its own that is interrelated with various other existing worlds, such as the world of professional figure skating, the online and temporary (event) spaces centered on fan culture and its communities, and the various existing cities on which the world of Yuri!!! on ICE is based. By analyzing not only a specific franchise, but also the variety of texts that relate with it from different theoretical perspectives, this thesis looks for gaps that can be filled in between different but related theories on media, semiotics, culture and space, particularly on the (re)construction of arbitrarily systematized worlds (both actual and virtual) through cultural production, signification and play.","['popular culture', 'convergence', 'semiotics', 'intertextuality', 'information society', 'media studies', 'consumption', 'media mix']"

"- ""Dipingere l'Italia"" - The Construction of Italian National Identity Through Italian Renaissance Figurative Arts","Dall'Osto, Tobia","['Migliori, Laura']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"At the moment of its unification, in 1861, Italy was one of the most linguistically, culturally, and economically fragmented country in the European stage. As a consequence, more than any other Nation it necessitated to be subjected to a process of national identity building driven by the ruling cultural élite. This BA thesis, through the lenses of constructivist theories on identity introduced by Anderson, Hobsbawm, et alia, surveys the top down approach with which (Italian) national identity has been constructed, promoted and enforced. In the majority of identity-building discourses, a cultural-linguistic element is usually taken as a term of reference and linchpin for such a construction. In this research, Italian Renaissance figurative arts are the cultural artefact will be analysed: it will indeed be surveyed how the intelligentsia of the time employed Renaissance arts in three retrospective exhibitions to promote a sense of national identity and belonging: the “Exhibition on the Italian Portrait” (Florence, 1911), the “ Exhibition on Italian Art 1200-1900” (London, 1930), and the expo “L’Art Italien de Cimabue à Tiepolo” (Paris, 1935). Finally, a discussion on the usage of Renaissance images on Italian cash money will follow. This study will show that Italy is a very diverse and fragmented country, whose unity and identity have been in truth strategically and artificially constructed and enforced. Nonetheless, it will also emerge that Renaissance figurative arts sincerely and surely are a ‘second language’ for Italians.","['Identity Construction', 'Renaissance arts', 'Italian Identity']"
From Copenhagen to Paris,"Mastenbroek, Leander Anne Gro","[""Hooghe, Ingrid d'""]",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In December 2015, the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) took place in Paris, France. The Paris COP has widely been perceived as the most successful climate change conference ever. It resulted in the Paris Agreement; here 196 Parties came together under one agreement with the aim of limiting the level of global warming to 1.5 to 2 ̊C above pre-industrial levels. On the other hand, you have the Copenhagen COP, a COP that took place six years prior to Paris, of which the outcome is widely perceived as a failure. This research looks at the changes in China’s stance between Copenhagen and Paris, with a focus on China’s role as a developing country. This research revolves around the principle of ‘Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities’, as this principle has been used as an argument for China, along with other developing countries, to exclude itself from any legally binding global climate agreement. Yet, the. This research has found that while China has not given up on the principle of CBDR-RC, there have been several factors that changed between Copenhagen and Paris that led China to compromise its previous stance, and ratify a legally binding international climate agreement for the first time ever.","['Climate Negotiations', 'China', 'Paris COP', 'Copenhagen COP', 'Common but Differentiated Responsibilities']"
Rendaku in Japanese place names,"Bokhorst, Michelle van","['Uegaki, Wataru']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The aim of this research was to investigate the occurrence of rendaku in Japanese place names based on two aspects: the region in which a name occurs and the final element of the name. By using a database from the Japan Post, 39 place names that showed variation in rendaku occurrence were investigated. It was expected that rendaku would occur in place names according to a core periphery model, where place names located in the core area would have a higher rendaku rate. The results showed that for many names, the rendaku rate was higher in the more central Kanto, Chubu or Kinki areas compared to the peripheral areas. Furthermore, it was expected that rendaku in names ending with the same element would show a similar geographical distribution across Japan. The results showed that all names ending with kawa behaved similarly, while for other elements the rendaku pattern varied per individual name. This thesis therefore concludes that rendaku in Japanese place names occurs according to a certain pattern, although this pattern varies per name. Further research, especially regarding accent patterns, is necessary in order to explain the variation of rendaku in Japanese place names.","['Japanese', 'rendaku', 'phonology', 'dialectology', 'sequential voicing']"

Innovative Competition with Chinese Characteristics.

In the ‘Made in China 2025’ initiative, the Middle Kingdom aims to become the leader in technological advancement before the half of the 21st century. It is essential to perceive the Chinese economic actions motivated by this development initiative, and how this influences global competition on innovation. This study consists of a qualitative approach investigating how the Chinese economic actions motivated by ‘Made in China 2025’ influence Sino-German competition. This is investigated trough an analysis of Chinese economic actions and is supplemented by perceptions of professionals in the field through two interviews. It is found that the new competitor is welcomed by Germany, which is also reflected by substantial cooperation. However, the influence of the Chinese government negatively affects the fairness of competition on innovation with Germany. A practical implication that derives from this is that screening of acquisitions by the German government is a solution to tackle Chinese government influence aimed at attaining knowledge. Further research can focus on which approaches are efficient for screening acquisitions.  ","['Innovation', 'Competition', 'Made in China 2025', 'international trade', 'acquisitions', 'state support']"

Diaspora through a Political Lens: The Influence of the Rwandan Diaspora on Foreign Policy Formulation in the Netherlands,"Härtl, Janine Marisa","['Smith, Karen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"“Processes of globalisation, new migratory patterns and the creation of transnational entities have altered political dynamics. Crossing geographic, cultural and political borders, diaspora communities have become more numerous gaining political significance. With the end of the Cold War and the opening of new political spaces, diasporas have been increasingly recognised as emerging non-state actors in the international arena. While the importance of studying diaspora politics and their impact has generally been acknowledged, there remains an active debate on the nature and scope of diaspora politics and their actual influence on the global political arena. In this context, this thesis examines how diaspora communities exert influence on foreign policy making towards their home countries. Through an in-depth case study of the Rwandan diaspora living in the Netherlands, it will contribute to the broader field of diaspora politics by generating insights that enhance the understanding of diaspora’s critical roles and political engagement with their host countries. Examining conditions – both attribute-based and contextual factors in the host country – which limit or enhance the diaspora’s ability to exert political agency, provides an understanding of the diaspora’s potential in influencing foreign policy formulation, contextualising them as actors in the global arena. “","['diaspora', 'foreign policy', 'Rwanda', 'The Netherlands']"

Despite the promising political start of the Politieke Partij Radikalen in 1968, no party on the Christian left has had parliamentary representation in the Tweede Kamer since 1991. The aim of this thesis is to discern which factors bear culpability for preventing the emergence of an electorally potent party on the Christian left over the past 50 years. Two case studies from the Netherlands and one comparative case study from Italy have been conducted with that objective in mind. Through analyzing existing academic scholarship and party manifestos, five overarching factors that have undermined the Christian left have been identified: the legacies of pillarization, consociational governance, the secularization of Dutch society, social conservatism in Orthodox Protestant Communities, and the ideological distance of the Christian left’s representatives from the political center.","['Dutch Politics', 'Christian Left', 'Politieke Partij Radikalen', 'Evangelische Volkspartij', 'ChristenUnie', 'L’Ulivo', 'Pillarization', 'Polarization']"

A Study on the Shifting Concept of Citizenship in Bahrain,"Heite, Lisa","['Henderson, Christian']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2011, citizens protested in most countries in the Middle East. While the Gulf states were less affected by these uprisings, Bahrain was an exception. During major demonstrations from February onwards, citizens demanded political, economic and social reforms. Most often, the situation there is presented in terms of a sectarian divide, but the thesis suggests that citizens were angered by restrictions to their right to muwatana, active citizenship. Through this analysis, particularly from the perspective of the citizenship approach, it becomes evident that the Bahraini regime has used citizenship as a tool of governance to keep control and to divide up the population. It has led to inequities between Sunnis and Shia, but also between Bahrainis and expats and between citizens from birth and naturalised citizens. Particularly, these groups are unequally represented in politics and society, have different opportunities to get employed and limited options to affect the political, social and economic outlook of their country. These factors have caused resentment among the population, stimulating them to rise up and seek other channels to have an impact.","['Bahrain', 'Citizenship', 'Arab Spring']"

Compatibility of Social Equity with Economic Efficiency in the Water Sector: The Case of Bolivia,"Muller, Daniela","['Amann, Edmund']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Lack of water access and inequality are deeply interrelated, particularly in developing countries such as Bolivia, where the poor often pay more money for less water. Simultaneously, continuous population growth and water scarcity prompting the rising demand for water, illustrates the necessity for large capital investments in infrastructure to ensure universal water access. For this reason, water management and regulation play a crucial role in water provision, as well as, in achieving sufficient profits for the water system’s economic sustainability. The main focus of this thesis is whether both, social equity and economic efficiency, can be achieved by water utility systems. This thesis studies the social and economic performance of six different water utility services in Bolivia, as well as, the effects of certain public policies on social equity and economic efficiency. Finally, it argues that the six cases of private, public, and cooperative water utility services analysed, show deficiencies in either one of the two criteria.","['Water Management Bolivia', 'Social Equity', 'Economic Efficiency', 'Privatized', 'public', 'and cooperative water utility systems']"
