Een verdwenen middeleeuwse voorstelling. Toetsing en consequenties van een datering aan de hand van twee zestiende-eeuwse kopieën.,"Veldhuizen, Mané van","['Grasman, Edward']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie wordt de datering van een verloren gegane voorstelling uit de vijftiende eeuw getoetst aan de hand van de allerlei informatie die we vinden op twee overgebleven kopieën uit de zestiende eeuw. Deze informatie bestaat uit de voorgestelde kostuums, de wapens, de nar, het tafereel en achtergrond. Ook is gekeken naar de geschiedenis van de originele voorstelling. Uitgangspunt voor de datering was de datering van Post, die meent dat de voorstelling tussen 4 oktober 1430 en 10 november 1431 gemaakt moet zijn. Niets wat in deze scriptie is besproken, kan de datering met zekerheid weerleggen. De wapens en de kostuums ondersteunen de datering zelfs. Dit heeft een aantal consequenties. Zo zijn Filips de Goede, Isabella van Portugal en de nar van Filips de Goede afgebeeld. Aangezien het hier gaat om een zeer specifieke periode, 1430-1431, vormen de voorgestelde kostuums bovendien een rijke bron voor kleding uit deze periode. Een andere consequentie is dat we waarschijnlijk kijken naar een specifieke gebeurtenis in 1430-1431 met betrekking tot Filips de Goede. Aanwijzingen in deze scriptie laten zien dat deze gebeurtenis geïdealiseerd is en dat het in ieder geval niet om een huwelijksvoltrekking kan gaan","['Bourgondië', '1430-1431', 'Verloren gegaan schilderij', 'kopieën', 'kostuums', 'geïdealiseerd', 'Filips de Goede']"
Electric shocks: integrating renewable energy in Europe’s electricity network,"Kerkhof, Felipe van de","['Correljé, Aad']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In an effort to meet global climate change goals, a decarbonization of electricity generation is needed. Analyzing the integration volatile renewable sources of energy like wind and solar, this thesis sets out to determine the underlying structural differences in the developments of electricity networks within the European Union. This will be done using a Most Different System mixed-methods design combining short statistical analysis with a qualitative study of the most (Hungary and Luxembourg) and least integrated (United Kingdom and Ireland) electricity networks in the EU. Constructing a framework to analyze the historical development, policy goals, market system and geographic factors in the member states of the EU, this thesis suggests the most important structural differences between the well and poorly integrated electricity networks in the EU are the historical developments of the networks, and the financial and geographical accessibility of neighbors to trade with. Secondly, an important contribution of this thesis is methodologically, as it displays an innovative way to study the different countries in the EU which gives enough flexibility to do justice to the differences between the member states of the EU.","['European Union', 'Electricity networks', 'Renewable Energy Sources', 'Network integration', 'Mixed-Methods']"
"French revolutionary salons. Politics and gender in the early years of the French Revolution, 1789-1793","Hendrikse, Jacomine","['Velde, Henk te', 'Laborie, Lionel']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Salons were a widespread phenomenon in late eighteenth-century Paris, but their political role during the first years of the French Revolution has been overlooked. As centres of news and information, places for education in political culture and political sociability, and public opinion shapers, salons were of vital importance for professional politicians and revolutionaries. The salonnière or hostess formed the centre of the informal conversation held between a select company of elite people, invited at her home and on her initiative. In this way she could wield power and have an informal political ‘career’. The flexible character of a salon, which is a concept changing according to its context rather than a fixed institution, makes it hard to give a definition. The case study of the political meetings at the home of Madame Roland questions the way in which salons have been regarded so far, for their place functioned as a headquarters of the Girondin political movement, a propaganda institution and a political salon in which she initially played little to no role. In the radicalising political environment leading towards the Terror, Jacobin revolutionaries who often were former visitors of the salons themselves increasingly regarded the salons with suspicion, rejecting its non-transparency, aristocratic character and female activities. By the end of 1793, both the revolutionary politicians and public opinion had turned against the salons and the elitist salon society, which disappeared from Paris.","['Political salons', 'French Revolution', 'Paris', 'Salonnière', 'Female political involvement']"
Vrijheid in het Nederlands onderwijsbestel,"Zeldenrust, Fenneke","['Haas, F.A.J. de']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,nl,"In de huidige tijd van polarisering, technologisering en digitalisering zijn onze liberale vrijheden niet meer zo vanzelfsprekend. Onze democratische rechtsstaat staat onder druk. Voor een oplossing kijkt men al snel naar het onderwijs, maar dat gaat zelf gebukt onder de gevolgen van het economisch rendementsdenken. Hoofdvraag in deze scriptie is: Hoe kan het toekomstig Nederlands onderwijs vorm en inhoud worden gegeven om te bewerkstelligen dat we, als mens en als burger, onze vrijheden beter leren bewaken en dat onze liberale democratische rechtsstaat wordt versterkt? Om een antwoord op deze vraag te formuleren bespreek ik allereerst om welke vrijheden het gaat en noem ik een aantal ontwikkelingen waardoor ze onder druk zijn komen te staan. Ook Plato’s beschrijving van de democratie komt aan de orde. Vervolgens bespreek ik wat de doelen van onderwijs zijn. Vertrekpunt daarbij is de visie van Aristoteles. Vervolgens wordt besproken wat in Nederland zwaarder moet wegen, het algemeen belang of individuele vrijheden. Daarbij ga ik in op de reikwijdte van de vrijheid van onderwijs. Vervolgvraag is in hoeverre het wenselijk is om burgerschapsonderwijs en/of persoonsvorming verplicht onderdeel te maken van het curriculum en zo ja, hoe dat kan worden gerechtvaardigd in een politiek liberaal land als Nederland, omdat dergelijk verplicht onderwijs op gespannen voet staat met de liberale waarden. De meningen hierover lopen uiteen, zo laat ik zien aan de hand van de visies van onder anderen Fowler, Brighouse en Rawls. Tevens ga ik in op de Capability Approach en de benadering van Nussbaum. Aan de hand van onder andere de theorieën van Rawls en Nussbaum zal ik verdedigen dat het wenselijk is het algemeen belang boven de vrijheden van het individu te stellen en bepaalde grenzen te stellen aan onze vrijheden, juist om deze te beschermen. Daarna bespreek ik drie onderwijsmodellen die Robeyns onderscheidt en ga ik in op de vraag welk onderwijsmodel het meest geschikt is voor Nederland. In het laatste deel beoordeel ik de plannen voor het toekomstig onderwijs zoals geformuleerd in het eindadvies van Platform 2032 en beargumenteer ik waarom deze slechts gedeeltelijk tegemoetkomen aan de in het voorafgaande deel door mij geformuleerde wensen.","['Vrijheid van onderwijs', 'Onderwijs 2032', 'Capability Approach', 'Rawls', 'Nussbaum', 'Liberal arts', 'Burgerschap', 'Persoonsvorming', 'Democratie', 'Politiek liberalisme']"

LIBERTARIANISM AND THE LIMITS OF STATE INTERVENTION IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE,"Rodenburg, Willem Johannes","['Verbeek, Bruno']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"There is a presumed legitimacy for the state to intervene in domestic trade because it is the arbiter between citizens within the state. In international trade, however, there is no presumed overarching sovereign political institution such as the state to fulfil a similar role. In order to answer the question of what the limits of state intervention in international trade are I will argue that there is no legitimate role for the state to play. I will do this by turning to Locke’s social contract theory of political obligation, and show that state interventions in international trade lie beyond the legitimate domain of state action. After this critique I will introduce a possible way in which states may still intervene in trade by analysing James’ principle of structural equity, which applies Rawlsian Justice in the domain of international trade. Through the principle of structural equity James tries to legitimize interventions in trade by appealing to a constructivist social practice approach where nation’s mutual reliance on trade furnishes the grounds for intervention in international trade. I will then point out that this approach is misguided, and cannot be accepted by libertarian thinkers because James appeals to the wrong agent involved in international trade, and consequently fails to legitimize the principles of structural equity. Moreover I will argue for a laissez faire approach to international trade which is based on the idea that if there is no overarching sovereign political authority in international trade, then there are no rules and regulations in such trade, except for those which the contractees agree too. Finally I will respond to a number of possible objections to this laissez faire approach.","['Libertarianism', 'International Trade', 'State Intervention']"
Exploring Role Models in Disability Advocacy: the Case of the Young Voices Programme in Zambia,"Jongenelen, Rik","['Elbers, Willem']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Persons with disabilities (PWDs) are the biggest marginalised group in the world, especially within the context of the global South. Having a disability is linked to extreme poverty because of lacking social services, high medical costs and low employment rates. These challenges contribute to a low self-esteem among young persons with physical impairments. On top of that, societal prejudices and negatives stereotypes about PWDs only further deteriorate their situation. This thesis clarifies the potential that role models have in disability advocacy, something that has never been researched before. Field research in Zambia demonstrated that role models have the potential to (1) address the negative self-esteem of youth with disabilities, (2) stimulate their pro-active attitude, (3) strengthen their ability to speak out and (4) enhance group solidarity. These outcomes are realised through indirect engagement between role models and disabled youth (through observation) and direct engagement (through teaching and feedback).","['disability', 'advocacy', 'role model', 'self-esteem', 'Zambia', 'awareness', 'youth', 'mentoring', 'capacity building']"

Migration to China and Attitudes Towards Unification and National Identity Among Young Taiwanese,"Drillsma, Ryan","['Pieke, Frank']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Over the years, China has engaged in a multiplicity of strategies to coerce Taiwan towards unification, and the Taiwanese towards assimilating under a singular Chinese identity. After the 2014 Sunflower Movement protests in Taiwan, China identified the Taiwanese youth as a target demographic for coercive measures. The state has rolled out a number of incentives to induce young, talented Taiwanese to migrate to China. Through a series of in-depth interviews with young Taiwanese migrants in China, this paper seeks to ascertain whether or not living in China for extended periods of time affects Taiwanese attitudes towards national identity and cross-strait unification. The paper finds that although Taiwanese are gratified with the personal development and career development time in China affords them, they do not change their attitudes towards national identity nor unification by virtue of living in China and interacting with Chinese people. They undertake several practices in order to negotiate their national identity that ultimately end up reinforcing it.","['Taiwan', 'China', 'national identity', 'cross-strait relations']"

From Vincent to the Visitor: A Rhetorical Analysis of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (2014-present) Considering Audience Awareness in Establishing Museum Communication,"Knaap, Raisa van der","['Zijlmans, C.J.M']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis analyzes the rhetoric of the Van Gogh Museum and exposes its communicative strategies holistically. An extensive and multi-faceted analysis on the persuasive character of the Rietveld building, the Kurokawa wing, and modern media shows that the communicative strength of the Van Gogh Museum is situated in its awareness of different audiences, their varying needs, and plural museum experiences. In a museum landscape where collection-oriented purposes are increasingly shared with public-oriented functions, the only way through which the museum is able to exert and preserve its expertise is by catering to its audiences. Revealing the rhetorical strategies behind the VGM’s communication results in an awareness that the postmodern museum is capable of transforming its commercial activities into valuable dialogues, in which the visitor is treated as an equal, active, and indispensable participant. Commercial museological practices do not threaten the educative value of the museum but carry the potential to actively encourage inclusivity and accessibility. The VGM emits this message in all of its inherently communicative elements.","['Rhetoric', 'Museum', 'Communication']"

In how many ways can you say the name Anne?

This thesis describes an exploratory elicitation experiment in which the effects of two pragmatic dimensions on the production of Dutch intonation is examined within three core meanings: “testing”, “selection”, “selection plus”. The productions of native speakers – realised on two-syllable proper names – were recorded in four pragmatic dimension combinations: default or vocative (orientation), and formal or informal (politeness). The meanings and pragmatic dimensions were embodied in situational contexts that served to elicit individual intonation contours for each meaning configuration. Additionally, the effect of word length was considered in a secondary experiment by employing one- and three-syllable proper names in a constant pragmatic environment. Results show a main effect of orientation across core meanings caused by different contextual variables. Politeness yielded only one main effect as a result of the configuration of speaker-hearer relations. Productions were found to be consistent across word lengths. The effects of the pragmatic dimensions are of definite influence on the production of Dutch intonation contours, but they could not be generalised across core meanings due to context discrepancies, indicating the importance of situational background.","['Phonetics', 'Pragmatics', 'Dutch', 'Intonational meaning', 'Elicitation experiment']"

"Habermas, legitimacy and deliberation. Let us bargain!","Ham, Pepijn van","['Verbeek, B.J.E.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"Does the deliberative model of democracy as theorized by Jürgen Habermas yield illegitimate outcomes? To answer this question, I trace the foundations of Habermas' deliberative model and explore several critiques outlined by Aletta Norval. I argue that Habermas' model does not produce illegitimate outcomes in the three ways that Norval suggests. Firstly, the elitist argument fails because it either misconceives the reconstructive core of deliberative theory or it underestimates the ability of the public sphere to accommodate difference. Secondly, Norval’s argument that the need for compromise-formation weakens the deliberative model such that it should be reconsidered as a whole, fails as well, because bargaining depends on that same discourse model in order to produce fair agreements. Compromise-formation is thus indirectly yet decisively subjected to the discourse principle. Lastly, the post-structuralist critique fails. For Habermas, an orientation towards consensus does not mean that agreement is the goal of discourse, as Norval claims. Discussion, not consensus, is what is central to deliberation. Furthermore, the principle of neutrality does not preclude differences from being discussed. It is not a normative principle, but rather a result from the reconstruction of actual practices of argumentation.","['Jürgen Habermas', 'Legitimacy', 'Deliberation', 'Democracy', 'Aletta Norval']"
The Belt’s buckle and beyond. On China’s power through its Belt and Road initiative using the case of Kazakhstan,"Vugs, Jeroen","['Milevski, L.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since its introduction, the Belt and Road initiative (BRI) has become a central Chinese foreign policy project and has consequently received a lot attention in the international sphere. By referring to ancient Silk Road times, China shows it is dedicated to take an inclusive approach by its desire to develop the initiative in all the countries that are willing to cooperate. One could argue that it is a product of China’s rise to becoming an economic and political heavy-weight over the last decades. Therefore, it is important for scholars to better understand the Chinese BRI. This paper seeks to contribute to this understanding by investigating the specific case of the BRI in Kazakhstan. As the largest country of the Central Asian region in terms of land, Kazakhstan holds a key position in the BRI as the area that will connect China to the Middle-East and Europe. This study aims to build on the idea that the BRI qualifies as a Chinese strategy in conducting this case study research. To produce such a study, this paper will draw on the framework of power as introduced by influential political scientist and assistant Secretary of Defense under former president Bill Clinton, Joseph S. Nye. In the remainder of this paper, Nye’s concepts of hard, soft and smart power will be understood as mechanisms for influence when looking at the Chinese BRI in Kazakhstan. More specifically, the ambition of this paper is to investigate whether China is combining hard and soft power elements in Kazakhstan into a strategy that could be understood as smart power.","['BRI', 'China', 'Kazakhstan', 'Heartland theory', 'Soft power', 'Hard power', 'Silk Road']"

Revaluating Cicero's De consulatu suo: The poetics of verbal repetition in 'the speech of Urania',"Salm, A.J.N. van der","['Pieper, Christoph']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This paper re-examines the interpretative potential of Cicero's De consulatu suo, with a focus on the so-called speech of Urania (Blänsdorf 6). Starting from the increasing awareness that our understanding of how Cicero's poetry was received is exceedingly one-sided and based on ahistoric assumptions, I seek to shift the common dismissal of his epic by investigating the little evidence we have to suggest that there was also a readership that did appreciate Cicero's poetry. Shifting focus to the poem itself, I first question what we know - and especially do not know - about the context in which the speech of Urania was originally found. Both in terms of general layout and vocabulary the text is recognisable as philosophical, but many more threads run through the poem, including Roman history and religion, the didactic language of Aratos' poetry, the nature of the cosmos and the gods, and the Roman community of city, senate, and people. These strands of meaning interact with each other in various nexus, as I demonstrate through an analysis of the overwhelming amount of verbal repetition that is found in the poem, and which does not necessarily give prominence to Cicero the consul alone. Thus, while the poem, as an autobiographical text, is certainly concerned with creating a favourable and usable public persona, its self-representational strategies also involve drawing the other players, whom in his other works Cicero is constantly involving in his concordia ordinum. This has important implications not just for our understanding of Cicero's way of speaking/writing about himself, but also for the interpretative strategies with which to approach Roman self-representational texts.","[""Cicero's poetry"", 'speech of Urania (Blänsdorf 6)', 'autobiography', 'self-representation', 'republican epic', 'repetition (stylistic device)']"
Strong External Representation of Future Generations: Legitimate and Effective,"Otten, Martijn","['Meijers, Tim']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"As current democratic governments are unsuccessful in fulfilling our moral obligations to future generations, future-focused institutions aim to adapt our democracy to neutralise this short-termism. However, it often appears to be impossible for future-focused institutions to be both effective and democratically legitimate. This thesis aims to resolve this dilemma by arguing for strong external representatives, representatives of future generations outside of legislative assemblies that have a strong mandate to veto laws that have a strong negative impact on future generations. To claim that this is not only effective but also democratically legitimate, this thesis analyses the most influential theories on the boundaries of the demos, the All Affected Interests Principle and Democratic Values Theory, and demonstrates that they require the inclusion of future generations by means of a strong-mandated representative. Finally, this thesis also provides several desiderata on how strong external representatives should be instituted and discusses its political feasibility.","['future generations', 'democratic theory', 'short-termism', 'representation', 'ombudsman', 'democratic legitimacy', 'political feasibility', 'All Affected Interests Principle', 'Moral obligations']"

The approach to the novel will consider that the hybridity of the postcolonial space is transformed into structural element and method of constructing the narrative. This hybridism is present in different levels: in the construction of characters, in narrator’s voice, in the styles and genre of the writings. It is a result mainly of the overlap of elements which are normally seen as opposites, like Fiction and History, Literature and Science. By bringing such elements together, Ruy Duarte deconstructs central ideas and categories of the Western thought and draws attention to different forms of seeing and understanding the world. This work will study two conceptual deconstructions that can be found in the novel: first the ideas which distinguish literature and scientific writings, mainly regarding the realm of anthropology and ethnography, showing how those polarities are entangled in the postcolonial universe; and in second place the concept of a linear chronological time, focusing on the idea of spectral presences and hauntings which disrupt the borders between past and present. Lastly, I will consider how those deconstructions work in the context of the Angolan literary project, as to assess how the book engages in a literary debate regarding the ideas of nation and identity, so important in the context of postcolonial states. Therefore, by subverting some paradigms of European thought, Ruy Duarte seems to be proposing alternative ways in which the Western world can relate to non-western areas.","['Angola', 'Anthropology', 'Specter', 'Ruy Duarte de Carvalho', 'hybridity']"

Big Bits and Small States: Examining Reasons for Variation in Cryptocurrency Regulation in Europe,"Rathod, Alex","['Scepanivic, Vera']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The advent of cryptocurrencies is the latest evolution in the marriage of monetary systems and technology, at its heart being digital assets; the oldest and most well-known of these is bitcoin. The subject of cryptocurrencies has proved extremely divisive, from those who believe they will ultimately replace national currencies to those who see them as a digital incarnation of an anachronistic system like the gold standard. These divisive opinions have manifested themselves through government regulatory approaches as well, with some governments seeking outright bans on cryptocurrencies within their borders. Some generally smaller states however, are pursuing establishment of flexible and progressive regulatory frameworks, seeking to become financial technology hubs for cryptocurrency development and trade. This thesis explores why these progressive regulatory responses to cryptocurrencies are being pursued by certain European ‘crypto-friendly’ states, and use both a case study and international relations theory - namely small state theory as developed by Peter Katzenstein in his seminal work ‘Small States in World Markets’ (1985) - in an attempt to understand why these differences exist.","['cryptocurrency', 'regulation', 'small states', 'Europe']"

There are several ways to describe smells and not all languages and cultures describe and use smells or describe smells in a similar manner. Studies show that smell can be described in various manners (Wilson and Stevenson 2006; Majid 2014; Wnuk and Majid 2013; Hombert 1992). Smells can be described by either using abstract terms, source-based descriptions or by using descriptive terms with the use of other perceptions. The focus in this thesis is on researching and describing the terms of smell in Hamar in order to determine how the Hamar describe smells. It is of importance to understand how the Hamar describe and use smells as this plays an important factor in understanding the culture. If the Hamar use a unique way of describing smells, then this knowledge gives us unique insight into the human faculty of language. This research is based on data collected during eight elicitation sessions with a native speaker of Hamar, Gele Hailu, at either the Leiden University Faculty of Humanities or in Gele’s home in Rotterdam. This thesis includes a grammatical analysis to determine in what word category the smell words occur and how these smell words are used. The eight elicitation sessions that are conducted with the use of physical stimuli and the grammatical analysis supplies us with a preliminary inventory of the smell terms of Hamar which in turn contributes to the framework of possible manners to index smell in languages of the world. Hamar uses source-based descriptions in combination with reduplication when describing smells; moreover, it uses an interesting construction which literally translates into English “it tells X” but has the meaning of “it smells like X”.","['Hamar', 'Olfaction', 'Grammatical analysis']"

Side-effects of Conditionality: The Case of the European Union,"Grammenos, marios","['Cusumano, Eugenio', ""O'Malley, Alanna M.""]",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This paper aims to examine EU’s power as an influencer against revisionist actors in its immediate proximity, especially through conditionality and socialization and their possible side effects, an idea which has not been examined adequately in academia thus far. Initially the concept of power in IR will be introduced with a special mention to its European form. Afterwards, the EU’s relationship with two revisionist regional actors (Turkey and Russia) is explored. The first case, examines the EU’s handling of Turkey during the displacement crisis and the latter’s shift towards authoritarianism. It will be shown that despite the fact that the EU has managed to dramatically decrease the influx of people in its territory, it has paid a steep political cost domestically and internationally. The second case shows how Russian preferential treatment to certain member-states impeded a unified approach from the EU. Only after the events in Ukraine a unilateral approach was agreed. Both cases show that the European understanding and usage of power is limited and prohibits the development of an ambitious policy mainly due to the current level of European integration and member-states will. Such results are important as they not only show current limitations of the EU’s policy-making, but also highlight some of the areas that require amelioration in order to enhance the EU’s capabilities in todays’ challenges.","['European Union', 'Conditionality', 'Power', 'Turkey', 'Russia']"

Turning the Page. The medium of the photobook approached through the act of walking and wandering reader-spectatorship.,"Poot, Joyce","['Westgeest, Helen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"When looking at the photobook as medium, it becomes apparent that the photobook has mostly been discussed as a presentation and storage tool but not as a medium of its own. Approaching the photobook as a medium from a historical perspective, it is interesting that the photobook, when discussed in an academic framework, has been theorized in matter of style and substance, looking at the evolution of the design and content of the photobook, but not in audience experience. At first glance, walking as a physical act and the reader-like walking through a photobook share the superficial characteristic of the possibility of freedom, as both the chosen path through the photobook and through walking is steered by the reader-spectator’s unique personality and life experience, which is not completely controlled by the author-artist and as such can have an unpredictable outcome. In this thesis, I aim to substantiate this claim. The reader-spectator’s hand turning the photobook’s pages are reminiscent of the wanderer’s feet exploring a path. To underline this argument, the act of walking is interpreted as metaphor. Where in an installation or exhibition space the spectator approached the artworks literally through their feet, now the reader-spectator approaches the photobook with their hands. In approaching the reader-spectator experience from this perspective, this research becomes also an investigation of the medium of the photobook.","['Photobook', 'Walking', 'Esther Hovers', 'Contemporary Art', 'Subjective Experience']"

Cultural ‘Othering’ in DC and Marvel Superhero Films in the Decades Following September 11: Are American History and Policies Reflected in Superhero Binaries?,"Vos, Anne Irene","['Sengupta, Roshni']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"American superhero films have become a more popular genre in the film industry after September 11. The narrative structure has largely been the same since the start of comic books in the 1930’s; there is a bad guy who causes trouble, countered by a hero to save the day. The film industries basing themselves on comics serves entertainment purposes, but can they also be seen as something more politically relevant? American foreign policies have focused on the ‘war on terror’ after the September 11 terrorist attacks and an ‘us’ versus ‘them’ rhetoric has been more present ever since. The ‘axis of evil’ speeches of former president Bush jr. have been televised globally, and this mantra of ‘outsiders are enemies’ is continuously echoed in the current “from now on it will be America first” tactics of president Trump (and many more politicians worldwide). A binary division is not new in the history of mankind, especially when one examines the colonialism and imperialism of the West of past centuries. Its aftermath still has dire consequences for minorities, and it is relevant to examine whether popular culture reflects and comments on this. This thesis will analyse whether and to what extent certain policy trends and historical events are mimicked or reprimanded in the characters and narratives of box office hits of the Marvel and DC superhero films. This thesis will discuss the narratives of superhero films and their portrayal of characters with a relationship parallel to some of the American (foreign) policies of the past decades. It is important to consider to what extent government propaganda is reflected in this form of popular culture that both have a global reach and possibly extensive effects. In short, to what extent do the films reflect the fear of the ‘other’ and portray the gap between ‘us’ (heroes) and ‘the other’ (villains), and can we elucidate a tangible change in the these processes in the 2001-now timeframe?","['cultural', 'othering', 'film', '9/11']"
"American New Women in China, Imperialism of a Beneficent Nature?","Schagen, Georgette","['Ling, G.I. van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Between 1911 and the end of the 1920s a large number of single female Protestant missionaries from the United States was working in China. By this time, the work of missionaries had evolved from being engaged in direct evangelism to providing social services in educational and medical institutions, and through these services indirectly spreading Christian civilization. This thesis questions if imperialism carried out by missionaries can be beneficent, and specifically focuses on the American New Women who came to China as single female missionaries. The reasons why these women came to China were diverse, some came because of their vocation others because they were longing for adventure. However, many of these women had more practical reasons. At the beginning of the 20th century it was difficult for educated women to find suitable jobs in the United States, China offered them career possibilities as well as a social position. The American government supported the missionaries in their effort to spread Christianity and American civilization, but the reasons for this support were far from altruistic.","['Missionaries', 'New American Women', 'Imperialism']"
The mission of the Dutch public library,"Jonge, Eva de","['Verhaar, Peter']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The mission of the Dutch public library was, and remains to be “the elevation of the people” through the access to information and the culture of reading. Unfortunately, the Dutch public library sector today deals with declining numbers in the number of library members, library visits, library branches, loans, and the scope of the collection. These facts are often assigned to budget cuts, but likewise to societal changes. Dutch citizens are increasingly making use of the Internet and digital media, and are making less and less use of traditional print media. Therefore, the Dutch reading culture is turning more and more into a digital reading culture. That is why Dutch public libraries – to remain relevant in the increasingly digital society – need to think about a new or adjusted realization of their mission. Public libraries in Scandinavia show that success can be found in a combination of the modern and the traditional. Most library visitors like to have a public space where they can physically meet and talk – surrounded by filled bookcases – but, simultaneously, to have access to new digital technology. Therefore, Dutch public libraries should attempt to find a middle way between the modern and the traditional. They should continue to offer a public place for the local community, with the traditional library services, but likewise offer access to digital technology.","['Public Library', 'Dutch public library', 'Media use', 'Third Space', 'History Dutch public library']"

"The spoils of war and priorities for peace, 1918-1926: A study of British policy towards the Greeks, Armenians and Kurds in Anatolia and Southern Kurdistan.","Blore, Andrew","['Thakur, Vineet']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyses the considerations of British officials when arriving at positions on granting sovereignty/ authority to: (i) the Greeks in Smyrna, southwest Anatolia; (ii) the Armenians within north-eastern Anatolia; (iii) the Kurds within south-eastern Anatolia; (iv) and the Kurds within the Mosul vilayet (Southern Kurdistan/ present-day northern Iraq), from 1918-1926. The concepts of “Orientalism” and “civilisation” provide the theoretical basis and are applied to the sources analysed. The thesis argues that Britain’s actions were influenced by the prevailing stereotypes of each people and “civilisation”, but ultimately rooted in political and economic interest. The Paris Peace Conference presented an opportunity to strengthen Britain’s position in the eastern Mediterranean and in the Middle East through support for the design of friendly states and re-drawing the political map of the territory within the former Ottoman empire. Each case was part of the process of erecting a new imperial structure in the Middle East. This new structure was to be based upon the organising principle of ethnic nationalism, as promoted by the Allied powers, including Britain. The British role in each case can be described as: the leading supporter of Greek goals in Anatolia; predominantly a supportive observer of Armenian goals in Anatolia, leaving the French to play the role of lead supporter; a cautiously supportive observer of the Anatolian Kurds with little authority outside of its dictation of the Treaty of Sèvres; and a cautious detractor of the autonomy of southern Kurds, having occupied the Mosul vilayet in 1918 and held full colonial authority over it, experimenting with autonomy but ultimately deciding on its abandonment. By 1926, the goals of the Greeks, Armenians, and Kurds in Anatolia and Southern Kurdistan had not been achieved, and all had withered away in British Middle Eastern policy.","['ethnic nationalism', 'civilisation', 'Anatolia', 'Kurdistan', 'Armenia', 'Greece', 'Ottoman empire', 'British empire', 'Middle East', 'statehood']"
Le thème des excès de la morale chrétienne dans La porte étroite d'André Gide et Moira de Julien Green,"Mourik, Janine","['Schulte-Nordholt, A.E.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,fr,"The writings of André Gide and Julien Green are very much influenced by the oppression they felt by the strict moral rules of Christianity during their childhood. The spiritual struggle they have had during their entire life made them criticize the demanding character of religion, and of Protestantism in particular. The two writers are very different when it comes to their origins, their attitude towards religion and their literary style, but in these novels, it is clear that they elaborate the same theme: that of the excessive Christian morality. In this study, the focus will be on the way both authors underline and question the strict moral rules that the protagonists of their novels impose themselves. First, a closer look will be taken at the spiritual quest the authors have gone through themselves in respect to the religious heritage of their childhood. Secondly, the novels will be studied by focusing on the way Gide and Green deal with the theme of excessive morality and express the critical attitude they adopt towards these excesses of the Christian religion.","['christianisme', 'puritanisme', '20e siècle', 'religion chrétienne', 'morale']"

Sex and Batman - A study of the representation of deviant sexuality in superhero comics,"Breedveld, Tom","['Horsman, Yasco']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Film- en literatuurwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this bachelor’s thesis, the aim is to analyze the way graphic novels add to the discussion on sexuality and its representation in society. Starting with a close-reading of Dr. Fredric Wertham’s Seduction of the Innocent (1954), this thesis will argue that comics, having long been accused of promoting deviant sexuality, decided to adopt this accusation as a badge of honor, and had the outcast-status of its superheroes be a critique on the exclusionist normativity of society. Close-reading the ‘revisionist superhero narrative’ (Geoff Klock: How To Read Superheroes And Why (2002)) in Alan Moore’s Watchmen (1986-1987) and The Killing Joke (1988) will out the way these comics represent the (repression of) sexual desire of its characters, and how they find safety behind their alter egos. Continuing with Batman, next up is Grant Morrison’s work with the character, who decided to ‘reconquer’ Batman’s psyche and sexuality. Close-reading the psychosexual nature of Arkham Asylum: A Serious House On Serious Earth (1989), an argument will be made for the way superhero comics advocate complete expression, and do away with repression. Lastly, this thesis close-reads the recent influx of superhero blockbusters (mainly the MCU), and argues that they, unfortunately, try to steer back to the idea of normativity as the most beneficial form of personal expression, choosing in this way to differ from their comics influence. In conclusion, this thesis wishes to present comics as a medium with the power to positively represent non-normativity.","['Sexuality', 'Superheroes', 'Revisionist', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe']"
The Politics Of Cryptography: How Has Cryptography Transformed Power Relations Between Citizens And The State Through Privacy & Finance?,"Chalmers, Ross","['Sengupta, Roshni']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research examines the role of Cryptography in altering the power relations between the State and its citizens in relation to both privacy and economics. As Cryptography has become stronger with the rise of the computer age the ability to hide oneself has accompanied it, however, this has also allowed for stronger surveillance techniques from the State as well. The debate between the privacy of citizens against the security of the State and its peoples have accompanied this debate since the rise of advanced Cryptology since the 1960’s. The Crypto Anarchist ideology has also grown with these advances and their battle against the State has been key in disseminating the ideas of privacy for oneself. In recent years, Crypto Anarchist’s have achieved their goal of a Peer-To-Peer decentralised currency by the name of Bitcoin. This has revitalised the movement and is another example of Crypto Anarchists attempting to wrestle back individual citizen’s control against that of the State. This paper will examine this understudied ideology and examine the battle that continues to this day between Crypto Anarchist’s, the State and its citizens.","['Cryptography', 'Encryption', 'Bitcoin', 'Crypto Anarchy']"

The Longus in Brevī Syllable: Length Inconsistencies in the Ṛgvedic Late Break,"Boers, Ivo H.G.","['Lubotsky, A.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis attempts to find explanations for the longus in brevī (LIB) syllables, heavy syllables in light positions, encountered in the Ṛgveda. After an introduction to the Ṛgvedic text and its metre, the data consisting of LIB syllables in the second syllable of the break of trimeter verses with late caesura are discussed. The research points out that there are no phonological environments that can explain the LIB syllables. Furthermore, it shows that there is no correlation between age and percentage of LIB syllables. Next, the findings of the research are presented. A portion of the data is explained by Bhārgavī verses, a metrical variation marked by a jagatī cadence although containing only 11 syllables, in hymn 77 and 78 of Book 10. The research proceeds to show that verses in other hymns containing a similar cadence cannot be seen as Bhārgavī verses because of a different pattern of the break. A number of them are solved by adding a pause after the caesura. At last, the thesis reveals two textual corrections that explain a number of verses. Two verses contain verbs with the -āyá-suffix in the second syllable of the break. These forms have been attracted into the larger category of -áya-causatives at the time of composing and have later been restored in their original forms, which did not accord with the metre anymore. The last textual correction is in the -e- of the word jyeṣṭha-, that is etymologically made up of two syllables. Some occurrences can be counted as disyllabic, others as monosyllabic. This is explained as either a handy poetic tool, or a difference between the archaic family books and the more modern books.","['Vedic', 'metre', 'Ṛgveda', 'syllable length', 'Bhārgavī', 'Longus in Brevī']"

Historical conflicts have always played an important role in shaping Chinese relations with Japan and Taiwan, as they cannot reach a common understanding about their shared historical memory.Regarding the Second Sino-Japanese War, each of the three sides have provided different depictions in their history textbooks. This thesis only focuses on the differences between Taiwan and Mainland China. Based on the findings above, the differences in the depictions of this war are mainly caused by the distinctive political interests and ideologies of the two sides. Furthermore, since this thesis also compares the history textbooks published on one side across time, between the 1980s and 2017, there also exist changes in a country’s political interests and ideology across time that also affect the textbooks.",
Sans-culottes and Slaves: Transatlantic Interactions and Popular Abolitionism in the French and Haitian Revolutions (1789-1794),"Gelderblom, Casper","['Lucassen, Leo']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"In political debates and academic literature, the French and Haitian Revolutions have often been presented as separate or even conflicting historical events. The emerging global historiography of the Age of Revolution increasingly brings to light the many links that connect these revolutions and render their dichotomization illegitimate. This thesis simultaneously draws on and contributes to this historiographical development by experimenting the methodological approach of Atlantic intellectual history from below. Focusing on the perspectives of the French sans-culottes and the insurgent slaves of Saint Domingue (colonial Haiti), it explores how these revolutionary groups’ exposure to a transatlantic flux of ideas and developments impacted their views on the slavery system between 1789 and 1794. The thesis reconstructs these views through a myriad of primary sources reflective of public opinion, such as French revolutionary newspapers and eyewitness accounts of the insurgent slave armies’ internal debates. In line with Homi Bhabha’s theoretical proposition that concepts have no ‘primordial fixity’ and can therefore be ‘translated and read anew’ in different ideological environments, it finds that the introduction of news and ideas from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean generated abolitionist popular mentalités among both the sans-culottes and the insurgent slaves. While the former came to conceive of themselves as slaves rebelling against their aristocratic masters and thus developed a view of Saint-Domingue’s slaves as natural allies, the latter fused French revolutionary rights-based discourse with originally West-African political culture to produce a syncretic political vision which rendered abolition imaginable and, therefore, attainable. The convergence of these distinct, yet ultimately commensurable, popular mentalités facilitated the general emancipation of Saint-Domingue’s enslaved population by the French colonial authorities in August 1793, followed by the formal abolition of slavery by the French National Convention in February 1794. The interwoven abolitionist history of the sans-culottes and the insurgent slaves presented by the thesis brings to the fore the commonalities, rather than the conflicts that characterized the connected French and Haitian Revolutions: it offers a mode of telling that might be hopeful and helpful in our own times.","['Haitian Revolution', 'French Revolution', 'sans-culottes', 'slave insurrection', 'abolitionism']"
A new approach to montage through Egyptian Hieroglyphs,"MiKyung, Choi","['Janna, Houwen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis is about filling the need for a new way to conceptualise montage. It is not only to analyse films with a new perspective but also to examine new montage through the relationship between film and linguistics. Most of all, film has been considered as a language as well as influenced by linguistics. In particular, montage has been compared to a grammar of a language helping people’s comprehension in their communication with films: montage is considered as a key effectively or powerfully conveying a narrative to the audience. Eisenstein developed a type of montage that was influenced by language. Montage of collision contrived by Eisenstein was derived from the Chinese characters and Japanese literary tradition such as the laconic form of poetry. Thus, he revealed the close relationship between montage and linguistics regarding film as a language. The relationship helps to arouse my research question, how a new approach to montage is deduced from linguistics, especially Egyptian hieroglyphs which have a unique structure: Egyptian hieroglyphs recorded the ancient Egyptian language with a mixture of sound(phonograms) and picture signs(ideograms). They embrace sound, text, and images like today’s components of moving images (or film). If the structure of Egyptian hieroglyphs is applied to montage in film, new forms of montage would be expected in diverse ways. Therefore, this thesis is to study a new approach to montage based on this connection between montage and Egyptian hieroglyphs.","['montage', 'Egyptian Hieroglyphs', 'Dismantlement Montage', 'linguistics', 'the relationship between film and linguistics']"

"Do Choices Matter? An Interdisciplinary Analysis of Decision-making in Video Games and its Effect on Storytelling, Immersion, and Player Interactivity","Rijn, Marco van","['Leeuwen, Evert-Jan van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Video games form one of the latest media in which stories are told. However, video games are not just stories - they are interactive experiences in which players have an active role. Therefore there has been much debate on how video games should be academically approached: can video games be analysed with methods used in literary studies or should new methods be developed. Yet, little to no research has been done on the relationship between storytelling and interactivity in a video game genre that blends these two features together unlike any other: choice-driven video games. While the genre is not unique in its approach to blend storytelling and interactivity, as role-playing games (RPGs) have done so for several years, it has become increasingly popular with video game developers specialising in these sort of video games, such as Quantic Dream and Telltale Games. This genre of video games is often marketed to highlight the players' freedom and control over the video games in which their decisions dictate the outcome of the story. Nevertheless, these qualities are often overplayed as scripted events serve as boundaries limiting the extent players are actually able to affect the outcome of these video games. Thus I propose that choice-driven video games (and RPGs) offer the illusion that players' choics, decisions, and actions are significant to the outcome of the video game they are playing through clever use of mechanics that provides players to chance to immerse themselves in these video games. Until Dawn (2015), Life Is Strange (2015), and Undertale (2015) are used as case studies for this thesis.","['video games', 'video game theory', 'narrative', 'immersion', 'interactivity', 'choice', 'narrative structure', 'ludology', 'choice-driven video games', 'until dawn', 'life is strange', 'undertale']"
Redeeming the Promised Land: An analysis of the popularity of religious Zionism in Israel after the Yom Kippur War,"Jongejan, Jeanne Christina","['Schonmann, Noa']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis asks how the rise of religious Zionism after the Yom Kippur War (1973) can be explained. This rise is puzzling, because whereas religious Zionism became more popular after the Six Day War (1967), this stemmed from the euphoria associated with the victory and the annexation of Jerusalem. The Yom Kippur War, in contrast, led to uncertainty, protests and delegitimation of the government. Why then, was religious Zionism not reduced in popularity but strengthened instead? Apart from researching this question, this thesis focuses on the relation between the religionization of Israeli society and the rise of religious Zionism. In the second chapter, the details of religionization in Israel are researched through statistics, secondary literature and primary sources. What aspects of society had been religionized, and in what ways? Chapter three analyzes the previous literature on the subject in light of the evidence found in the previous chapter, but also scrutinizes whether there actually was a causal relationship between religionization and religious Zionism. Although this research found no conclusive evidence on the causal relationship between religionization and the popularity of religious Zionism, it does confirm other reasons behind its rise. Firstly, religious Zionists framed themselves as the new generation of pioneers, in contrast to the Labor government which took the blame for the Yom Kippur War. Moreover, the religious Zionists downplayed the influence on earthly events on the redemption of the Jewish people, which made the movement able to survive the setback that the Yom Kippur War arguably formed. Finally, secular ethno-nationalists were also attracted to religious Zionism as they shared a common goal: keeping the occupied (or ‘liberated’) territories.","['Israel', 'Yom Kippur War', 'Six Day War', 'Religious Zionism', 'Zionism', 'Religionization', 'Settlements', 'ethno-nationalism', 'Judaism', 'Desecularization']"

Experimental research has found supporting evidence for the psychological reality of its parameters. This study proposes a combination of an artificial grammar learning task and a grammaticality judgement task to explore the mental representation of the constraint hierarchy in more detail. 19 Native Dutch speakers participated in this study, of which two were excluded. During the artificial grammar learning task participants implicitly learned a grammar. The stimuli were constructed using an OT-analysis of reduplication. During the GJT task, participants were asked to rate non-optimal and optimal candidates. By looking at the gradient judgement of the candidates, the learned constraint hierarchy can be analysed. After further investigation, a correction on the constructed OT-analysis was necessary. The reanalysed data revealed a relation between the responses and the simplified strata hierarchy. This relation showed similarities to the previously researched acquisition of initial state grammar. A multitude of challenges had to be overcome during the completion of this experiment. These challenges might contribute to the development of a well-defined methodology to further explore the psychological reality of OT.","['Optimality Theory', 'Artificial Grammar Learning', 'Judgement', 'Psychological Reality', 'Final state grammar']"

Fallacious minds: Locating the Flintstones fallacy within the archaeological literature of cognition.,"Wezenbeek, Martijn","['Sleutels, Jan']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Recently, it has been claimed that Homo neanderthalensis was capable of producing cave art. This is, however, merely one amongst a plethora of examples that arguably demonstrate their enhanced (symbolic) cognitive capacities, usually attributed exclusively to Homo sapiens. This has led some researchers in cognitive archaeology to believe that the Neanderthal mind was essentially similar to ours, apart from a ‘final acquisition’. Such a mind, that is at least partly accessible via our understanding of ourselves, could subsequently serve as a kind of gateway through which past experiences can be reconstructed. However, a crucial aspect of the reconstruction of a ‘past mind’ involves projecting our own self-image of humans as conscious, thinking creatures. Such a self-image may very well contain features typically associated with modernity and which have been acquired only recently. Importantly, in reconstructing past minds researchers have to be aware of the dangers involved in using folk psychology and academic psychology as the normalized conceptual frameworks to interpret ancient minds with. In this thesis I will examine some of the strategies utilized to assess and reconstruct past minds and determine whether they are committing the so-called Flintstone’s fallacy. The Flintstone’s fallacy, in short, points toward the mistake of hastily projecting our self-understanding (or certain features belonging to it) onto past minds. The evaluative focus will be mainly put on the cognitive literature in archaeology, since this field attempts to combine cognitive theories with the available archaeological empirical evidence (mostly provided for by well-dated anatomic reconstructions, genetic profiles, technological artefacts, ‘art’, luxury items and religious artefacts).",
"Is strategic stability a viable solution for the current situation between Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia?","Hardy, Bálint","['Rodriguez Idarraga, Nicolas']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study has been conducted to examine the situation of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, more closely Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Starting from a neorealist perspective, the study argues that balance of power is needed in the region and nuclear proliferation may be a balancing tool. Consequently, the study hypothesizes that strategic stability, which is an outcome of nuclear deterrence, offers a solution to the to the situation among these three countries. Strategic stability can be achieved by nuclear proliferation therefore this study proposes that Iran and Saudi Arabia should proliferate to counterbalance Israel’s nuclear hegemony in the region. When strategic stability is achieved, then as the theory holds, nuclear powers will not confront each other and thus, the region will be more stable. The study utilizes the work of Waltz, Mearsheimer, Kissinger, Parsi, Walton, Long, Colby, and Steinbruner to name a few. The findings have revealed that in theory strategic stability would be a viable solution to overcome the current situation, however given the complexity of the region and the relations among these countries, it is very unlikely to be achieved.","['strategic stability', 'nuclear deterrence', 'israel', 'iran', 'saudi arabia', 'neorealism']"

Marketing Revolution and gauging the character of popular opinion: The Dutch Revolt in English pamphlet culture c.1566-79. To what extent did English pamphlet culture regarding the Dutch Revolt constitute a discourse of popular political participation?,"Moore, David","['Fagel, Raymond']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Focusing on the Dutch Revolt in English pamphlet culture before English opinion became rationalised through the Treaty of Nonsuch in 1585, the document that formalised England’s support for the United Provinces, this thesis explores the nature of popular interaction with the tracts and the range of discourses, explanations, and expressions of consumption politics. Uncovering the nature of this discussion by giving a fuller expression to the poetics of material dialogue, how the Revolt was explained, understood, and consumed, and gauging the character of the Discursive common, I argue that the pamphlets here studied, and the pamphletised politics surrounding public opinion on the Dutch Revolt, was the product of an intimate interaction with Popular opinion. Pressed into service as informal counsellors through consistent appeals to public authority as a nominative body, it is argued that Popular counsel was a major factor in the language of pamphlets and pamphleteering. By exploring the marketplace of print as a site of conscious political activism bordering on sedition, that understood the Revolt as a political revolt supported by an open public sphere, English readers are presented as judicious critical thinkers capable of understanding the Revolt as the result of more than just the short-term diachronicities that tended to characterise populist print. Keenly attuned to the specifics of events in the Low Countries, complex tripartite politics and cosmopolitan armies, as well as specific charters invoked through print, this literati could counsel legitimately. Openly countenancing rebellion, and attempting to legitimise it through public politics, English readers came to understand how the Populus could legitimately critique monarchy, and how William of Orange was able to sustain a credible argument for armed resistance. By exploring these ideas thematically, it is suggested that the infusion of popular participation was an element in the Treaty of Nonsuch, which reflected marketplace opinion and commercial strategies, and the growing need for accountable governance.","['Popular Opinion', 'Popular Counsel', 'Pamphlet Culture', 'Public Politics', 'Popular resistance theory', 'Early Modern Politics', 'Commodifying revolution', 'government critique', 'Tudor Politics', 'Europe in English Tudor History']"

My research revealed that there existed for most of the period distinct and opposite images of William V in Great Britain. I have linked these images to the opposing ideologies of the conservatives and opposition or radicals. All exploited the ambiguity of the personality and position of the prince in their debate with each other, by using a positive or negative image of the prince. The Dutch Patriot Revolution, the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, the French Revolution, the war of the First Alliance, the fall of the Republic and consequent flight of the prince to Great-Britain and the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland form the background to which newspapers wrote about William V. My research sheds light on several historiographical debates, for example the periodisation of the emergence and decline of British radicalism, the rhetorical tactics that were used by the different sides, what caused debate on the stadholder, the emergence and effects of loyalism, as well as giving a systematic and thorough overview of the way the British thought about William V for the first time.","['Stadhouder', 'Willem V', 'conservatives', 'British newspapers', 'Beeldvorming', 'radicalism', 'Great-Britain', 'Dutch Republic', 'Ideological Debate', 'Dutch Patriot Revolution']"
The relation between natural resources and income inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa: A difference between having resources and using resources,"Aarts, Robin","['Vicente, Ruben Gonzalez']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focusses on the question of how the dependence on natural resources affects income inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa. There exists a huge debate in literature on the concept of a ‘natural resource curse’, whether this exists or not and what the main reasons behind this curse could be. However, most scholars seem to focus on how natural resources affect economic growth, whereas this thesis analyses the effect on income inequality. After a review of previous research, this thesis will bring forward its own empirical analysis with the application of regression models to investigate the effect of natural resource dependence on income inequality. Since no general link can be derived from this empirical analysis, the thesis focusses on three different countries (Mali, Angola and Zambia) to see how the relationship between natural resources and income inequality works for countries that are similar in their dependence on resources, but different in their level of income inequality. These countries share similarities in certain aspects, such as the importance of geography and economic isolation of natural resources, but they differ in other aspects, such as their colonial background and resource management.",['natural resource curse - natural resource dependence - income inequality - Sub-Saharan Africa']
Will Chinese replace English as the global language?,"Fan, Zhenlin","['Sybesma, Rint']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis discusses the properties of the current global language English, along with other three languages: Esperanto, Latin, and Classical Chinese who once were or close to be an international language. This paper attempts to figure out if Chinese will replace English as the next global language by listing the properties of a global language following a comparison of the list with properties of Modern Chinese. In order to find out the properties of a global language, this thesis analyzes the reasons why each language became a global or a regional lingua franca and why some of the languages failed to maintain the status of being an international language. The result shows that being a global language often relies on colonial expansion, strong influence in multiple fields throughout the world and the easiness of acquiring the language. Chinese being the only language written with characters and the principle of “Peaceful Rise” of China makes Chinese less likely to be the next global language.","['English', 'Chinese', 'Mandarin', 'global language', 'lingua franca', 'future language']"

I am you when you speak - The role of turn taking in personal deixis acquisition,"Ros Redon, Helena","['Verhage, Arie']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Personal pronouns are deictic terms which, unlike most other words, are characterized by the lack of a stable reference. They shift the referent with every change of speaker in a conversation. In the process of language acquisition, children have to discover how to comprehend and produce personal deixis correctly, which demands knowledge of speech roles. To study this process, researchers have focused mainly on pronoun analysis. In this thesis, we suggest that turn taking can also be used for this purpose, since this interactional system constitutes the context where language is learned. We analysed turn taking competence, role reversing competence and correct personal deixis production in typically developing and autistic children. Our results showed different performance between groups, and suggest that turn taking competence is positively correlated with correct deixis production. To sum up, this is the first study to point out the importance of children's competence in turn taking to measure and study personal deixis acquistion.","['language acquisition', 'autism', 'turn taking', 'deixis', 'shifting reference', 'speech roles']"
African Identities - a New Perspective,"Pinxteren, Bert van","['Akinyoade, Akinyinka']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The UN Sustainable Development Goals acknowledge ‘that all cultures (…) are crucial enablers of sustainable development’. In academic literature on Africa, however, cultural diversity is analysed as a problem, rather than as an enabler. Africa is either seen as one culturally homogeneous whole or as incredibly diverse and fragmented – there seems to be nothing in-between. Therefore, the picture is incomplete at best. Yet information on culture is used as the basis for assertions on Africa and its problems in economic and other areas. This thesis questions both visions of African cultures, using Vansina’s theory on the autonomy of cultural traditions as its starting point. Methodically, it uses an approach developed in cross-cultural psychology. Cultures are described here as value systems that serve as common points of reference to peoples. Using the cultural dimensions approach of Hofstede and Minkov a new exploratory analysis has been made of current self-perceptions of Africans, using data from the World Values and Afrobarometer surveys. This leads to information on differences and similarities in cultural values between more than 200 ethnolinguistic groups from over 30 African countries. The information has been partly triangulated through Focus Group Discussions in Ghana and in Southern Africa and by comparing information from those countries with ethnographic and other literature. The thesis sheds new light on cultural differences and similarities in Africa. It shows that there are considerable cultural differences within Africa; not all cultures in Africa are equally ‘collectivist’, for example. The essentially Eurocentric shorthand method of equating language with culture cannot be used in Africa: in many cases, cultural areas share different languages; in other cases, one language may be shared by people with different cultures. The thesis shows that such situations may be relatively common in Africa. The thesis calls for a new perspective on African identities and draws attention to the need for rebuilding cultural autonomy, based in African languages.","['Africa', 'culture', 'values', 'cross-cultural psychology', 'identity', 'Ghana', 'Southern Africa', 'Afrobarometer survey', 'World Values Survey', 'ethnicity']"

Yet one region in Germany remained largely closed to the refugees and expellees: the French zone of military occupation. In 1945, the French occupying authorities refused entry to the refugees, and though they eventually took in some over the course of their occupation, it was an order of magnitude lower than those absorbed into the American, British and Soviet zones. This thesis investigates the reasons behind this initial French position of refusal and its evolution from the immediate end of hostilities in 1945 to the creation of the West German state in 1949. In doing so, it places the question of the refugees in the broader context of France’s overall war aims and its policy towards post-war Germany and Europe. The same security, economic and demographic concerns that drove France’s Germany policy also shaped its response to the refugee crisis; the issue of the refugees and expellees usefully illustrates the trajectory French policy took over the occupation period.","['Refugees', 'Germany', 'French Zone of Occupation', 'Expellees', 'Occupation policy', '1945-1949']"

How Did Peter Pan Grow Up Into A Children's Story?,"Fallanti, Silvia","['Kasten, Madeleine']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The tale of Peter Pan by J. M. Barrie (1860–1937) has found its way to a children's audience despite the tensions it elicits around the idea of childhood. After the novel ""The Little White Bird"" (1902), where Peter appears for the first time, and its stage adaptation ""Peter Pan"" (1904), both explicitly intended for adults, Barrie arrived at his final version for children published in 1911, the novel ""Peter and Wendy"", through a tormented history of reworkings. My research aims at exploring the significance of Barrie’s constant reshaping of the Peter Pan materials in order to recast the story for a young audience. Moreover, I will investigate as to what extent the ambiguity and instability of the Peter Pan fictions have been tamed in its school and cinema adaptations. These adaptations have deployed strategies to counter Barrie’s rebellious attitude against the didacticism and pedagogic expectations which are conventionally associated with children’s literature. As will become clear in the following, Barrie challenged the traditional barriers between adults and children on many points. Nevertheless, Peter Pan has been singled out to become a cultural icon of children’s literature – hence, my central questions: How, exactly, did Peter Pan grow up into a children’s story? What conflicting discourses and ideologies concerning childhood may be seen to inform Barrie’s different versions of the Peter Pan story?","['Peter Pan', 'psychoanalysis', 'Edwardian literature', 'Hook', 'Darwinism', 'Jacqueline Rose', 'Barrie', ""children's literature"", 'ideology criticism']"

External Intervention in Post-Civil War Democratization: a Theoretical Approach To The UN in Sierra Leone and Angola,"Babled, T.","['Rodríguez Idárraga, N.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The main aim of this research will be to analyse the factors, presented theoretically, which have made the United Nations one of the prime actor responsible for democratization globally. Through the use of Madhav Joshi’s theory on post-civil war democratization and the election analysis framework provided by the United Nations Development Program, this research will seek to answer the question: how has the UN favoured the ground for democratization in post-civil war situations? It hypothesises, by applying Joshi’s theory, that the UN presence is fundamental for the creation of post-civil war democratization, because of the various, positive incentives it gives to the warring parties and the population. Furthermore, it seeks to prove how the absence of the UN in a country, which theoretically would have the factors to democratize, tends to bring that country to autocracy. The research will first lay an extensive analysis of the literature present in academia surrounding the subjects of civil war, post-civil war elections, and democratization. By doing so, it provides an overall understanding of the situation in the present of intra-state conflict and subsequent missions. The methodology proposed is a single-case study, with the UN at its centre. This is because a single case study gives the opportunity to seek to explain numerous different theories connected to one single unit, and, in doing so, would prevent confusion and overexplanation. Narrowing the scope in this way will provide a thorough understanding of the UN practice and the theory surrounding its actions. However, to prevent over-narrowing the scope, without therefore giving any meaningful contribution to academia, this research will apply the theory explained in the methodology to two sub-units in which the UN led different interventions: Sierra Leone and Angola. Subsequently, it will give a more case-based analysis which will provide, in greater detail, an answer to the research question. The importance of such a question lies in the necessity to analyse intra-state conflict, which has become the deadliest form of large-scale violence.

How is China expanding its Sea Power? Exploring the Improvements and Prospects Regarding China’s Maritime Strategy,"Mahieu, Victor","[""d'Hooghe, I.M.A."", 'Creemers, R.J.E.H.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"China’s military build-up and modernization has raised concern among IR scholars and several Asian countries in the recent years. This in mainly due to the fact that China is involved in different territorial issues in both the East and South China seas. Indeed, recent developments in the PLA have been regarded by the countries with opposed territorial claims (Vietnam, Japan, Philippines, etc.) as an indication of the Chinese willingness to change the current status quo. Beijing has develop its naval capacities and the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has been the branch of the Chinese army that has focused the most attention. The PLAN fast evolution is impressive and Beijing is now able to produce indigenous complex structures such as aircraft carriers. Furthermore, the increasing militarization of reefs and islets, and the assertive Chinese behavior in both aforementioned seas are according to many scholars driven by the Taiwan issue, fish and oil prospects. The former, would be the main reasons driving Chinese military developments in the region. Accordingly, an improved naval force would allow Beijing to assert its primacy in the different maritime claims by disrupting the balance of power. However, such a reading often puts the East and China seas issues as core interests for the PRC, which would ultimately explain China’s recent naval developments. Therefore, emphasis is rather put on geopolitics rather than on geo-strategy, and the PLAN modernization is analyzed through a realistic lens, which leaves very little room for positives prospects. Chinese development is put in parallel with what might be an unpeacful rise and authors such as Mearsheimer (2006) are skeptical and predict future conflicts in the region. However, according to other scholars the PLA modernization needs to be considered from a wider perspective. Although, enhanced naval capabilities can improve Beijing room of maneuver in different territorial issues, enhancing its naval capability would improve China’s capabilities to defend its interest on a global level. There is no consensus among scholars as to what are the underpinning reasons driving China’s increasing military assertiveness in the East and South China Sea. By using concepts of naval strategy such as Sea Power and command of the Seas, a better assessment can be done on what China is trying to achieve with its navy. According to different scholars, the coreness of the South China Sea and the East China seas needs to be questioned. It could be argued that foreign policies priorities have shifted, and that the different issues might rather be instrumental. Indeed, they would allow Chinese authorities to develop a blue water sea navy that in return would enhance China’s power projection on a global scale. Different maritime issues should not be perceived as flashpoints but rather aimed at increasing Chinese control of near seas, which would ultimately allow Beijing to move further. On the other hand developing military means doesn’t have to be interpreted as “a trouble ahead” and as “a tragedy of great power politics”, rather a Chinese navy that would be able to project power on a global level might help China to improve its power both in times of war and peace.","['Seapower', 'China', 'naval strategy', 'Mahan']"

The Authority of International Law - A study in international legal positivism,"Poppe, Daniël van de","['Boot, Eric']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyses the authority of international law from the perspective of international legal positivism. The traditional approach that takes the state’s will as the foundation of international law is problematic as it results in the voluntarist dilemma. For international law to have objective power, a state should be incapable of escaping its authority by its own will even though this will is what constituted international law in the first place. The incompatibility of this would mean that international law’s authority is actually based on a ‘special’ will that is external to the wills of states. Georg Jellinek devised a theory of international law that supposedly accounts for international law’s objective authority while maintaining the state’s will as its foundation. His theory is built on what he calls “the normative force of the factual”, but falls short as it cannot withstand Hume’s law. Herbert Hart’s theory of law is more promising as it leaves the state’s will out of the equation and focuses on legal practice to understand the necessary features of a legal system. International law, however, is “law” but not a legal system. This thesis challenges Hart’s understanding of international law as “law” and argues that there is an international legal system consisting of primary and secondary rules.","['Positivism', 'legality', 'international law', 'authority']"

The thesis will take steps to provide some clarity in this area. The thesis will focus on three case studies: the United Kingdom, Denmark and Poland, and the impact of their Euroscepticism on Economic and Monetary Union, social policy, migration policies, and the notion of the EU as a liberal integration project. The thesis will find that increasing anti-migration rhetoric identified across all case studies, opposition to monetary integration, welfare chauvinism and fears over supranationality are restraining European policy development, and giving rise to a multi-speed Europe. The thesis will also find that the role of historic relations with Europe, and nationalist mythos continue to shape British ‘hard Euroscepticism and Danish and Polish ‘soft’ Euroscepticism. Indeed, the thesis will also argue that pervasive Eurosceptic rhetoric, which has existed for decades, shapes the rhetoric and policy direction of the EU, with overtures towards narrowing the ‘democratic deficit’ and attempting to establish direct citizen-institution relations.",

Why in Cuzco Quechua,"Erkel, Ted van","['Cheng, Lisa']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"There are four different constructions for expressing ‘why’ in Cuzco Quechua, namely imanaqtintaq, imapaqtaq, imaynapitaq and imaraykutaq. Analytic tools from the syntax-semantics interface are used to highlight the differences between these why-structures. Imanaqtintaq seems to behave like ‘how come’. Syntactic restrictions related to the fact that this combination of morphemes does not leave a trace are shown. Examples of these restrictions are the fact that imanaqtintaq does not have a pair-list reading and the fact that quantifiers cannot take scope over this wh-element. The underlying meaning of imapaqtaq comes from the benefactive marker -paq. Due to pragmatics imapaqtaq could also be interpreted as ‘why’. Imaynapitaq is strongly related to imaynataq ‘how’. The causal aspect that the method-reading of imaynataq shows in relation to the presupposition of the question can also be found in imaynapitaq. This results in the fact that imaynapitaq takes an event as a reason or cause for the proposition of the question. Imaraykutaq is the most transparent why-structure. This combination of morphemes is closest to the English ‘why’ and can be used to obtain any kind of reason or cause. Since imaraykutaq has the broadest meaning, it is barely used. The other forms might provide a more specific gap related to the proposition of the question. This results in a more sufficient way of updating the knowledge of the one asking the question.","['why', 'wh-questions', 'why-questions', 'how', 'how-questions', 'Quechua', 'Cuzco Quechua', 'reason-questions']"

Little research on watching subtitled television programmes for English language acquisition has yet been conducted in the Netherlands and no research has been conducted in which the focus was on one specific topic of vocabulary. To test the hypothesis, a six-week study was held among secondary school students who watched an English-spoken programme either with or without English subtitles. The vocabulary used in this programme was similar to the vocabulary used in the course books at the school. One group of participants served as the control group and watched the programme without any subtitles, while another group of participants served as the experimental group and watched the programme with intralingual subtitles (subtitles in the same language as the soundtrack). The results of this six-week study show that watching an English-spoken programme with English subtitles is an effective approach to learning new vocabulary on a specific topic.","['subtitling', 'translation', 'interlingual', 'intralingual', 'secondary school', 'vocabulary acquisition']"
Between Mortals and Immortals. Kleos-driven Heroization of Athletes in 5th-century BC Greece.,"Aartsma, Lotte","['Beerden, Kim']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the 5th century BC, athletes in Greece increasingly became heroized and celebrated in legend and cult. Through alleged displays of dúnamis, aretē, and other parts of their narratives, athletes were compared to mythic heroes and associated with a ‘heroic paradigm’ that made it possible for them to gain enough kleos or ‘fame’ to turn into new heroes and to become incorporated in Greek legends. The aim of this thesis is to compare these ‘heroic athletes’ to non-heroized athletes in a threefold way: by looking at athletic feats and displays of strength (dúnamis), other ways in which athletes measured up to a heroic paradigm in life (aretē), and alleged manners of death and possible cults as they were narrated in Greek legends. In doing so, it lays bare similarities and differences between accounts of heroic athletes and those who were not heroized, and takes a step towards applying the notion of kleos to the ideological motivations behind Greek processes of heroization in the 5th century BC.","['Classical Greece', 'Immortality', 'Heroization', 'Athletics', 'New heroes', 'Heroic paradigm', 'Kleos', 'Aretē', 'Dúnamis', 'Religion']"

Revisiting Russia’s Managed Democracy: Experiences as a Limited Access Order,"Atanasova, Nathalie","['Robbe, Ksenia']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The failure of democratization theory to explain the transitions (or lack thereof) in the post-communist world after the dissolution of the Soviet Union opened a whole field of newly created regime-types for academics to theorize and categorize. Numerous theoretical frameworks have long been applied to analyze the Russian “managed democracy”. Conclusions have followed that Moscow has the tendency to utilize economic and political assets for the perpetuation of their ‘soft-authoritarian’ regime. Exploring the shortages in the existing literature, this paper looks at the applications of the explanatory model of authoritarian behavior, developed by North, Wallis, Webb and Weingast in their book “The Shadow of Violence”. Moreover, this newly developed interpretation of the transition period brings a valuable insight in the mechanisms behind the formation and development of authoritarian and hybrid regimes by evaluating its epistemological and conceptual reasoning in non-Western cultures. While the conventional explanations tend to focus on hybrid regimes as a stable intermediate entities that need to be pushed towards democracy by removing their authoritarian qualities, the conclusions of this paper will focus attention on how authoritarian qualities can be utilized to facilitate a more smooth and non-violent transitions towards democracy. This alternative angle in transitional studies highlights the need for a new approach in policy making when dealing with such regimes.","['managed democracy', 'hybrid regimes', 'democratization theories', 'transitional studies']"

"The Iconography on Ivory Wands, typically called ""Magic Wands"", from the Collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art","Duistermaat, Rutger","['Müller, Miriam']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Oude culturen van de mediterrane wereld (Bachelor),Bachelor thesis,en,"Ivory wands are crescent-shaped objects fashioned from hippopotamus tusk. They are often inscribed with figures, motifs and (less often) hieroglyphic inscriptions which can be applied on both sides. Discussions regarding the name of these objects and their function are still ongoing but the possible find of the Egyptian name of this object, Sna m Abw ‘Ivory Repeller’, can lead to consensus regarding the naming. Ivory wands are presumably products of a temple workshop as is shown on the tomb walls of Rekhmira. If this is the case, the rare use of an enclosure on wands might refer to these temples. Over 90% of the excavated wands were found in tombs but traces of use such as repairments and reworked endings also show a usage during lifetime. Moreover, depictions show their usage by wet-nurses and inscriptions on the wands also suggest a purpose during lifetime. These inscriptions usually start with Dd mdw and continue to either designate the speaker(s) using in or start the recitation itself. The figures on the wand state that they have come to draw protection over a specified person: ii.n=i/n stp=i/n sA Hr  (mst n ) (anx wDA snb) I/We have come to draw protection over  (born to ) (live, wellfare, health) The figures on ivory wands are referred to as sAw ‘protectors’ and nTrw ‘gods’ in inscriptions. Most figures found within the corpus of all-known wands are also represented on wands from the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art: only the figures ‘7. Profile lion-maned/eared figure, male (child?)’ and ‘25. Donkey head’ are not included. The most represented figures are the hippopotamus-lion, lion standing on hind legs and jackal-headed leg(s)/staff. The figures of the lion rear and long-legged feline with short neck are only found in the corpus of the MMA. In the case of the long-legged feline, I explain this uniqueness to a wrong interpretation of the depiction itself. Five ivory wands from the MMA corpus are preserved completely. Eighteen other wands are fragmented, leaving only one or two figures (partially) visible. The complete wands show no preference in orientation of the figures while the figures on the fragments are mostly facing right. With the exception of three wands, a single framing line is used on all wands. The curvature of objects shows that wands of compositional alignment categories IV, V and VI are absent in the MMA corpus. Figures are placed next to each other without use of any motifs in between. Fragments MMA 15.3.951A,B and MMA 32.8.3 can possibly be from the same wand but closer inspection is necessary. Some patterns emerge when the arrangement of figures is analyzed. First off, the group of hippopotamus-lion, lion standing on hind legs and frontal lion-maned male. The figures appear next to each other on at least four wands which proves their close connection as deities. Animal heads at the proximal and distal endings are seen as a characteristic feature of ivory wands. This is true in the sense that they only appear at the endings, but in most cases another figure is placed at the endings. For example the lion rear figure which shows a distinct pattern regarding its position. It is placed at the proximal end and a hippopotamus-lion is found besides it: 1-26-P.END. There is some use of repetitive sequences of figures on the wands. An example is the vulture figure which is only carved onto two wands but represented three times on one of them. On this same wand (MMA 26.7.1288A,B + Louvre E3614) the vulture is accompanied in twofold by a combination of the hippopotamus-lion and sitting baboon. A repetitive sequence is also found on wand MMA 22.1.103 where the vulture is placed between torch figures. Other repetitive sequences like this do not occur within the corpus, but figures are represented multiple times on seven wands. Taking in account the fragmentary state of most wands, I would suggest that there is no tendency to maximize the number of figures. Three methods were used to identify work of the same craftsman: comparison of 1) figures found besides each other, 2) measurements of the figures, and 3) style of the figures. Only the third method led to MMA 15.3.951A,B and MMA 32.8.3, being the work of the same craftsman. The first two methods are unsuitable for fragmentary objects: the order of figures is often unclear and partially visible figures cannot be measured. Although the measurement of figures and comparison of their data could be used to analyse a huge amount of objects, the process is time consuming. I would suggest identifying certain characteristics of figures (some already mentioned by Quirke and Altenmüller) such as skin-decoration, shape of the eyes and presence of a lump on the abdomen, and inserting this data in a database where user-friendly analysis can be done: https://online-collections.net","['Magic wands', 'ivory wands', 'MMA', 'ivory repeller']"

For every Third World country, the defining of national identity and the construction of national belonging is especially crucial to the social stability and the social development. Egyptians identity issue merged in 19th century, when Egyptian intellectuals were influenced by Western “nation state” thought and tried to identify the national identity of Egyptians. From the 19th century to 1967, we can find that the development process of Egyptian nationalism has a clue --- from a vague distinction of “Egyptians” and “un-Egyptians” to an attempt of construction the national history; from “the lack of nationalism” to the struggle between different kinds of nationalism to the dominant of Arabism. However, the disastrous rout of Egypt in 1967 Arab-Israeli War cut down this process and a series of political events in Sadat era was finally resulted in a new identity crisis in Egypt society. In that case, Egyptian government had no option but to re-shape the Egyptian national identity for the sake of repairing the crack of society which made by the identity crisis and maintaining its legitimacy. In Sadat era, Egyptian government amended history textbooks, constructed some new national museums and introduced some new symbols. However, The measures undertaken by the Egyptian government under Sadat did not create a new consensus over what the ‘Egyptian nation’ is. Quite on the contrary, many national identities compete with each other but none of them can be a dominant ideology.","['Egypt', 'national identity', 'Sadat', 'Arab nationalism', 'Pharaonism', 'national historiography']"

Political Activists and Accidental Martyrs: Politicization between Students and Workers within the South Korean Minjung Movement in the 1980's,"Serafino, Moreno B.","['Green, Christopher K.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Koreastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social movements often encapsulate people from multiple different social groups. While the participant of a social movement can be identified simply as such—a participant—he or she still maintains his or her own social group identity. In the South Korean case, the popular minjung movement of the 1980’s shows how social group division can be transcended by propagating an ultimate goal presented as a collective good. The minjung movement, which ultimately upheld democratization as its ultimate goal, encapsulated students and workers, among other social groups. In general, in order to make such a movement prosper, the movement’s participants should make an effort for mobilizing or politicizing the masses if they wish to influence the authoritarian ruling class. However, the fact that multiple social groups are participating presents problems. How exactly does one social group politicize the other within the same movement? Does one group take it upon itself to commandeer the movement, while other social groups are enticed to follow its lead? While members of the minjung movement shared the belief in a collective good—which in the 1980’s first and foremost was the democratization of South Korea and the abolishment of draconian rule—valiant efforts had to be made by both students and the working class in order to propagate the movement’s ideology. This thesis shows that the minjung movement did not simply uphold one leading social group that politicized all others. Instead, students and workers within the movement formed a relationship in which politicization flowed in both directions. Using Bert Klandermans’ mobilization theory, this thesis demonstrates that student activists employed action mobilization to recruit the working class, while the workers themselves unintentionally employed consensus mobilization to influence the students.","['Minjung', 'Labor', 'Students', 'Workers', 'Politicization', 'Mobilization', 'Class-consciousness', 'Gwangju Uprising', 'Activism']"

Even with the Soviet legacy of an urban bias in counterinsurgency, Russian forces lacked a serious amount of training fighting in urban environment during the first Chechen war, leading to many casualties. This was a big lesson for the Russian Federation, but they did not come up with the proper solution for the second campaign. Instead of training on combat in urban environments, they concluded that forces should be trained to avoid urban combat. Forces however still had to engage in urban environments without the proper training, which meant they did not learn from the first war. In the first Chechen war communication an coordination errors contributed to many Russian casualties. Even though the Russian forces were able to learn lessons from incidents and apply them in the same battle, they were incapable of transmitting the knowledge beyond the soldiers and commanders who had designed it, causing the hard-won knowledge to be lost between the battles. This partially improved during the second campaign as friendly fire incidents decreased, but other coordination problems remained as the new commanders lacked experience using assets from different divisions. The not learned lessons were not decisive enough to change the ultimate outcome of the war.",['Chechnya Russia counterinsurgency doctrine strategy tactics']

Deze plotselinge hernieuwde belangstelling voor boza wekte bij mij de interesse op om de geschiedenis van de Turkse drinkcultuur te onderzoeken: Wat dronken de Osmanen, waren er problematische dranken, veranderde de drinkcultuur met de oprichting van de Republiek Turkije in 1923, hoe kunnen we de opleving van de belangstelling voor Osmaanse drankjes sinds enkele jaren verklaren en wat zijn de redenen voor het recente alcoholverbod/genotsmiddelenontmoedigingsbeleid van de AKP-regering?","['Ottoman Drink Culture', 'Alcohol Prohibition', 'Alcohol Consumption', 'Turkish Drink Culture', 'History', 'Turkey', 'Boza', 'Tea']"

Chinese in the Dutch tropics. Political-economic changes in West Borneo between 1912 and 1942,"Yip, Chi Ho","['Schulte Nordholt, Henk']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"From the beginning of the 18th century small groups of Chinese migrated to Southeast Asia. The Hakka from East Guangdong (China) migrated to West Borneo and founded kongsis, which were groups of mining laborers who agreed to divide labor and financial responsibilities. The Hakka worked in gold mines, farms and trade. The kongsis had a high level of autonomy. Chinese autonomy started to decline in 1823, when several kongsis, like Lanfang, accepted Dutch rule and paid taxes to them. Migration from China ceased and it did not increase until the 1900s. In 1884, the last remaining kongsi federation, Lanfang, collapsed. Thus, the last institute of Chinese autonomy in WB ceased to exist. After a period of relative stability following the collapse of the last kongsi, between 1912 and 1942 a series of important politico-economic events came to shape the Chinese community of West Borneo in new ways. Between 1884 and 1912, the Chinese Districts remained autonomous, as the Dutch government did not formally proclaimed the territory as Dutch and the Dutch did little to intervene in Chinese economy and politics. From the end of the 19th century, the amount of Chinese who migrated to WB increased and the total Chinese population in the area became larger. Interestingly, the new gulf of immigration to West Borneo encompassed more women than during the migration movements of the previous century. The living conditions in China were bad, as there was a Civil War, political instability, the threat of Japanese imperialism threatened political coherence and stability. There was also a lack of land to farm – which obviously had dire economic repercussions. offered an opportunity for a better future. The thesis focuses on certain politcal-economic events, to show if there were any changes in the autonomy of Chinese in politics and economy, after the collapse of the last kongsi.","['West Borneo', 'West Kalimantan', '1912-1942', 'Chinese diaspora', 'Hakka', 'Chinese autonomy', 'Republic of China', 'Netherlands East Indies', 'Pontianak', 'Politics and economy']"

The Role of Memory Sites and Memory Museums in Curating Collective Memory in Peru,"Samanez Pacheco, Sondra Alena","['Valdivia Rivera, Soledad']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since the formation of the Peruvian Republic in 1821, until the creation of the Truth and Reconcili- ation Commission in 2001, collective memory was curated through a single narrative. This type of collective memory curation aimed at building a national identity and thus unifying a country with deep-rooted ethnic, social and geographic divisions. However, as Peru was ravaged by an internal war from the year 1980 to 2000, the deadliest conflict the nation has faced in its history, new spaces opened for the curation of collective memory. The most notable of these spaces are memory sites and museums, which fuels the question that guides this thesis: what is the role of memory sites and memory museums in curating collective memory in post-conflict Peru? Firstly, the concept ‘new wars’ and how it has shaped the meaning of post-conflict shall be explored. Followed by a delve into collect- ive memory and how its curation has changed in the last century through memory sites and museums. Consequently, chapter two analyses the socio-political context which led to the development of new ways of curating collective memory in Peru and the role collective memory had and has in national politics. Chapter three analyses the role of the ‘Lugar de la Memoria, Tolerancia y la Inclusion Social’ (Place of Memory, Tolerance and Social Inclusion, LUM) in curating collective memory in post-conflict Peru.","['Collective Memory', 'memory sites and museums', 'post-conflict Peru']"

Bridging the Valley of Death: Social Venture Capital and Microfinance in Kenya,"Volz, Florian","['Bellucci, Stefano']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Today around 2.5 billion people remain unbanked or underbanked, meaning they lack access to basic services such as checking accounts and loans. In addition, social entrepreneurs desperately need sustainable financial vehicles to stimulate economic growth from the bottom-up in underdeveloped countries. How to bring financial services to the doorstep of the poor has hence always been a question at the forefront of the global development industry. Since its inception in the 1970’s, the modern concept of microfinance has consequently drawn much attention to itself. At times, its pioneer father Muhammad Yunus has even been hailed as having invented the solution which would ultimately end global poverty. This thesis first examines microfinance in Kenya and evaluates its respective effectiveness in stimulating social entrepreneurship. It then includes social venture capital as a possible alternative to traditional impact investment tools and ultimately hints at a new combined direction in financing Africa.","['microfinance', 'impact investment', 'social venture capital', 'entrepreneurship', 'poverty', 'kenya', 'african studies', 'economics', 'valley of death']"

They are now the fifth biggest ethnic group and are officially called ‘New Immigrants’ in Taiwan. According to the Taiwan Social Change Survey conducted by Academia Sinica about the public attitude towards Southeast Asian marriage immigrants in 2004 and 2014 respectively, we find an evident pattern that the overall public attitude towards Southeast Asian marriage immigrants has become more positive and inclusive during this decade. In this thesis, on the basis of the survey data, I argue that the marriage immigrants’ social capital plays a pivotal role in the transformation of public discourse in Taiwan. I apply the theory of social capital to analyze how the New Immigrants’ social capital is generated, accumulated and exchanged, and focus on three forms of social capital: bonding, bridging and linking. I propose that a broad social network based on their social capitals enabling marriage immigrants to participate in public affairs is the core element which affects the overall attitude of the host country.","['marriage immigrant', 'Southeast Asia', 'Vietnam', 'Taiwan', 'public attitude', 'social capital']"
A critical analysis of the 'Big Men' phenomenon in the 'good governance' debate in contemporary Africa: the case of Kagame.,"Medina Bermejo, Alba","['Smith, Karen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"It is not groundbreaking that developing countries face totally different challenges to that of advanced economies. Many African countries have long suffered the effects of the ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach taken by the international community regarding different issues such as governance. The aims of this paper are to examine the role ‘Big Men’ play in the shaping of the current ‘good governance’ agenda. More specifically, how Rwanda’s president Paul Kagame defies many of the criticisms neopatrimonial leaders receive regarding their way of doing politics. In spite of not following what is considered as prerequisites in the pursuance of development, he has managed to turn the country into one of the fastest developing nations of the present day, doubling its GDP PPP in less than 10 years. Furthermore, other indicators like the GDI and the HDI also show the striking improvement the country has experienced since the incumbent president assumed office. The combination of neopatrimonial networks of patronage for the creation of rents and his authoritarian style of the ruling has proven effective in the achievement of such rapid growth. He has defied the universal assumptions on the political capabilities of alternatives types of regimes. This thesis proves that the conventional ‘good governance’ needs revision.","['Good Governance', ""'Big Men'"", 'Kagame', 'neopatrimonialism', ""'market-enhancing' governance"", 'development']"

Zij schreef o.a. gedichten en vertaalde Klassiek Japanse literatuur naar Modern Japans. Echter schreef zij ook feministische essays en kinder- en meisjes verhalen. Vooral haar shōjo shōsetsu (meisjes verhalen) worden in Engels -en Japanstalige literatuur nauwelijks behandeld, omdat zij worden bestempeld als broodschrijverij. In deze scriptie laat ik door een analyse Akiko's shōjo shōsetsu 'Tamaki no ichinenkan' (Tamaki's Jaar) zien dat dit beeld van haar shōjo verhalen te simplistisch is omdat dit verhaal niet zomaar de shōjo-gendernormen uit de Meiji-periode reflecteert, maar een afspiegeling was van het vrouwbeeld en de levensstijl die Akiko in haar essays aanprees. Deze verhalen kunnen worden gezien als een uitwerking van haar feministische essays voor jonge meisjes, en hadden dus duidelijk een ideologische boodschap. Middels dit verhaal bood Akiko een alternatief voor de gendernorm (die tevens de standaard was in shōjo shōsetsu) van ‘de shōjo als ryōsai kenbo (goede vrouw en wijze moeder)-in-spe’.","['Yosano Akiko', 'Shōjo', 'Meiji-periode', 'gender', 'ryōsai kenbo']"

This thesis examines the central question of why Pancasila plays a recurring key role in Indonesian nation-state building. Adopting the rarely used framework of the dynamics between the nation and the state, this thesis tells the life-story of Pancasila. Through the historical examination of Pancasila’s life, this thesis argues that its resilience is due to Sukarno and Suharto, respectively Indonesia’s nation-builder and state-builder. Their 53-year presidencies entrenched Pancasila so deeply and forcefully into the foundation of the Indonesian nation-state that subsequent political actors, be it state or non-state, had to engage in the Pancasila discourse. Challenges to Pancasila manifested in the repeated calls for an Islamic state in Muslim-majority Indonesia by conservative Muslim groups. These were primarily deflected away by Sukarno’s and Suharto’s domination of Pancasila but paradoxically it left little room for Indonesian people themselves to decisively reject alternatives to Pancasila, thereby contributing to its recurring role in Indonesian nation- state building.","['Pancasila', 'Indonesia']"

Upon noticing that urban developmental projects related to heritage did not seem to operate as intended during my fieldwork, I began with the question of “why Huế has not quite become the modern city as it aspired to through these projects.” To answer this question, I decided to analyze the process through which the cityscape of Huế was reshaped from three different angles developed in each chapter. The case of Huế shows how urban projects related to heritage are tightly bound to modernist notions of progress and development. During this process, there will be expectations to a better future, but there will also be frustrations of not being able to reach this goal. The concrete evidence is that the city is still pursuing a process of urban transformation propulsed by those heritage related projects. They are mediated by contradictory dynamics involving the regulators and the subjects assumed to be regulated.",

The application of the social urbanism model under mayor Sergio Fajardo is said to have contributed to the inclusion of historically marginalized neighborhoods substantially, however, although murder rates have declined as a result, violence continues to be a problem affecting the residents of these neighborhoods. Therefore, the question that this thesis addresses is: how has the construction and improvement of transit infrastructure, as part of the city’s model of social urbanism, contributed to social inclusion and violence reduction in what were previously the most violent neighborhoods of the city? The findings of this research suggest that the effects of the interventions were limited to the areas surrounding the transit constructions and social urbanism failed to benefit the population of the marginalized comunas as a whole.","['Colombia', 'Violence Reduction', 'Medellín', 'Infrastructure', 'Social Urbanism', 'social exclusion', 'San Javier', 'Popular', 'Comuna 1', 'Comuna 13']"

With the increase of electronic mass media, and the availability of internet worldwide, the influence of cinema is greater than ever. Cinema has proven to be one of the most influential instruments in popular culture for shaping current trends. Due to its large influence on both culture and mind-set, cinema also serves as a mean for politicians to affect the values of the civilization. Taking into account the growing influence of cinema on both ‘public opinion’ and politics, the stereotyping of Muslims could have a negative influence on the public image of Muslims worldwide.

The Bolshevik ‘’Gardeners’’ of Society? An analysis into Cheka conceptualisation and application of violence as an instrument of social engineering during the Russian Civil War,"Looijen, Benjamin","['Kern, Henk']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"During the last half of the nineteenth century, major European colonial powers tended to see society as something that was malleable and that the state should act as a ‘’gardener of society’’ rooting out ‘’weeds’’ in the ‘’social body’’ wherever they are through the use of military statistics, surveillance, deportation and the use of force among other things. This idea of social engineering became conceptually and practicably possible only with the rising concern through the last half of the nineteenth century for the social realm and the emergence of technologies for acting upon this realm. This thesis is about how the Bolsheviks, inspired by these ideas, used violence as an instrument in applying social engineering and the fashioning of a new (Soviet) social body during the Russian Civil War. The subject of this thesis is the Cheka, the first Bolshevik secret police and security agency, and its leader Feliks Dzerzhinsky, and takes as its starting point that these actors might have played a crucial role in the execution of the so-called ‘’gardening state’’ and the use of violence in achieving a ‘’pure’’ Soviet social body in which ‘’contaminating elements’’ have been excised. I will show to what extent the Cheka conceptualised and operated on society through techniques of violence during the Russian Civil War. I argue that the Cheka and its leader Feliks Dzerzhinsky played a prominent role in the execution of the ‘’gardening state’’ that the Bolsheviks were in the process of shaping. Both their conceptualisation in language as well as their violent performances can be deducted as partly the result of envisioning the Soviet social body to be a supposed utopia, that required the excising of unreliable, unwanted or dangerous elements. These elements were plentiful, and in the end, the classification of what was considered malign could be extended to those individuals considered allies of the Bolsheviks, or even Bolsheviks themselves. However, deviations by both Dzerzhinsky and his chekisty occurred on multiple occasions in relation to cleansing society of elements. It is these deviations that call into question to what extent the Cheka thought the ‘’gardening state’’ should go, in its efforts to mold the population.","['Russian', 'Civil War', 'Cheka', 'Dzerzhinsky', 'Bolsheviks', 'Violence', 'Social engineering', 'Holquist', 'Secret police']"

Through a focus on the anti-corruption policy field as a case study, the argument which will be advanced is that the 2014 Euromaidan did lead to a qualitative opening of the political system and the policy-making process in stark contrast to the authoritarian and exclusionist nature of the former Yanukovych regime. The post-2014 period has therefore seen considerable involvement of CSO representatives in public policy-making and a sustained formal commitment to dialogue on the part of many representatives of the authorities. More recently, however, a trend towards de facto marginalisation of CSO representatives and the closing of previously productive channels for cooperation suggest a moderate reversal of initial positive tendencies and raise questions about the extent to which the positive developments of 2014 and 2015 can be treated unambiguously as a sign of a large-scale and sustainable shift towards participatory governance.","['Ukraine', 'Euromaidan', 'anti-corruption', 'public policy-making', 'civil society']"

To achieve this, four versions of the tale have been analysed and compared: “Le Petit Chaperon Rouge” by Charles Perrault, “Rotkäppchen” by the Brothers Grimm, “The Company of Wolves” by Angela Carter, and Princess of the Silver Woods by Jessica Day George. This dissertation is meant as an addition to the existing feminist discourse on gender and fairy tales and the theoretical framework exists mainly of historical context to Perrault’s version of the story, Judith Butler’s theory of gender as a construct, Alexander Boon’s definition of the hero figure as masculine role model, and Riki Lane’s views on the relation between nature and nurture. Concluded, these male role models have become more complex, but they still offer only a limited array of masculine role models accepted by contemporary mainstream culture.

For long, scholars have debated which of these discourses has been dominant, or whether these discourses have been promoted simultaneously. This thesis contributes to the growing body of work on Kazkakhstan’s nationhood process by looking at the competing nation-building narratives that are presented through two sport projects: the Astana Pro cycling team, and the promotion of Kazakh national wrestling. The analysis has made clear that the wrestling and the cycling projects are each used to promote different elements of Kazakhstan’s national identity; while the wrestling emphasizes the ethnic conception of Kazakh identity, the Astana Team is more focused on gaining international prestige. At the same, time, the narratives and symbolism used in the two projects are often ambiguous and sometimes even contradictory. Thus, this thesis has shown that competing nation-building narratives are promoted simultaneously and as such, it has highlighted the complex and hybrid nature of Kazakhstan’s nation-building process.","['nation-building', 'Kazakhstan', 'sports', 'Astana cycling', 'Kazakh kures', 'wrestling', 'ethnic', 'civic', 'transnationalism']"

'Hell No We Won't Go': Louise Day Hicks als symbool van de 'anti-busingmovement' en 'white backlash' in Boston,"Sonnemans, Evi","['Bilt, Eduard van de']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze scriptie gaat over het woelige desegregatiedebat in Boston begin jaren ’70 en focust zich specifiek op de kwestie rond ‘busing’, een al dan niet geforceerde transportmethode waarbij kinderen op overwegend zwarte scholen zouden worden overgeplaatst naar overwegend blanke scholen, en andersom, met als doel herstel van de raciale balans en uiteindelijk integratie. Het conflict betrof een belangenafweging tussen ouders die zich aangetast voelden in hun keuzevrijheid tussen scholen en ouders die zich verzetten tegen de schrikbarende verschillen in het onderwijs tussen blanke en zwarte scholen. Verzet tegen ‘busing’ werd gevoed door een combinatie van racisme, etnische en sociaaleconomische segregatie, maar vooral eigenbelang, motieven die in deze scriptie centraal staan en uitvoerig worden geanalyseerd. Het verzet werd aangevoerd door Louise Day Hicks. Zij speelde een sleutelrol in bovengenoemde kwestie en voerde een zeer dominante boventoon in het debat rond geforceerde integratie dat zich daaromheen wortelde. Het onderzoek vraagt zich echter af in hoeverre Hicks daadwerkelijk kan worden beschouwd als symbool van de conservatieve tegenreactie, omdat ze op qua persoonlijke idealen en ambities afwijkt van haar politieke achterban en deze soms vanuit een politiek opportunistisch motief lijkt te vertegenwoordigen. Het onderzoek is vernieuwend, omdat het de gespleten beeldvorming rond Hicks poogt te doorgronden en het onderzoek zich toelegt op onuitgewerkte bevindingen over Hicks en daarmee afwijkt van de veelvoorkomende, eenzijdige demonisering van haar politiek optreden.","['desegregation', 'Boston', 'busing', 'Louise Day Hicks', 'white backlash', 'anti-busing']"
The Propagated Message about North Korea’s Visual Propaganda in Under the Sun.,"Koene, Kayra","['Ceuster, Koen de']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Koreastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2015 Russian director Vitaly Mansky’s documentary film Under the Sun was released. Under the Sun was supposed to be a ‘joint venture’ between the Russian director Vitaly Mansky and North Korea’s Ministry of Culture represented by the DPRK’s Korea Film Export and Import Corporation, a production company that is credited in the beginning of the film. However, according to Mansky, the contract stated that “every single detail had to be approved by North Korea’s Ministry of Culture.” These details that needed to be approved ranged from decisions made about the script to the kind of cameras Mansky was allowed to use. Mansky, who was “used to having complete creative freedom”, seems to have had problems with this working relationship. Thus Mansky went around the North Korean authorities’ rules to create his documentary film. Mansky says he let the cameras roll all the time, and duplicated his video cards before they were given to the some unspecified North Koreans –Mansky says he did not know who they were- who reviewed Mansky’s footage and had to approve it. The film seems to have been disapproved by North Korea long before the finished product hit theatres. The contract between Mansky and North Korea’s Ministry of Culture was broken in 2014, when Mansky’s access to North Korea was shut down, as well as any communication from his ‘partners’ in North Korea. The film also brought up the topic of safety for those involved. The question was whether people would face repercussions for being linked to Under the Sun. In an interview with The Guardian Mansky says that the Russian Federation wanted to have its name removed from the film’s credits, claiming that they were scared because they “lied to our North Korean partners”, but also because they were afraid of what would happen to the North Koreans who are seen in the film. In that same interview Mansky said he excluded some footage that might have had negative repercussions for the family that is followed in the film. Mansky’s Under the Sun has strayed away from whatever form the initial project was meant to have. Instead of being a ‘joint venture’ Under the Sun is a production made by Vitaly Mansky and it is he who has created the story. In that way it is a Vitaly Mansky documentary film, and not a North Korean documentary film. Moreover, Under the Sun should not be read as a North Korean propaganda piece, but rather a visual document that explores North Korean propaganda. Under the Sun inherently concerns itself with the topic of propaganda; Mansky makes use of a contrast between what is ‘reality’ and what is ‘fabricated’. How does Mansky’s treatment of the topic of propaganda in Under the Sun portray North Korea? This thesis will argue that in Under the Sun Mansky tries to point out and dissolve North Korea’s visual propaganda to emphasize the misery of citizens in the North Korean system, as well as emphasize the cruelty of North Korea as a totalitarian state.","['korean', 'north korea', 'documentary']"

Theological Trends in Sunnī Tafsīr on Q.11:117: Universal Ethics and Divine Punishment,"Mol, Arnold Joost Willem","['Berger, M.S.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Religiewetenschappen (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The tafsīr tradition is, as an accumulative and overarching science, a direct reflection of the trends emerging in other Islamic sciences. Exegesis on verse Q.11:117 became an important marker for Islamic theology: (A) God transcends any form of injustice, therefore when He destroys a people it is caused by their own theological injustice i.e., unbelief/idolatry/major sins (vertical ẓulm). It therefore presents faith (ʾīmān) as the main expression of ethical goodness (maṣlaḥa), and unbelief as a just cause for divine wordly punishment. This interpretation became the exegesis of the Muʿtazila, as represented by al-Zamakhsharī (d. 538/1144). (B) God does not destroy a people for their theological injustice, but provides them respite as long as they are not unjust towards others i.e., their vertical ẓulm is ignored as long as they do not perform horizontal ẓulm. It therefore applies the separation of faith (ʾīmān) and works (aʿmāl), and views ethical injustice (horizontal ẓulm) as the main cause for divine worldly punishment. The Sunnī tafsīr tradition adopted the (B) reading early on, which in the post-classical period functioned as an uṣūli foundation for the preference of human rights (ḥaqq al-ʿibād) over divine rights (ḥaqq Allāh), as represented by the Later Ashʿarī scholars al-Rāzī (d. 606/1210) and alBayḍāwī (d. 685/1286). Our analysis will show the development from early to contemporary tafsīr works on Q.11:117, which went through several paradigm shifts, from the emphasis on divine justice towards the emphasis of human justice, becoming a school defining heuristic and thereby acting as a ground for theological humanism within Islamic thought.","['Qurʾān', 'Islamic ethics', 'Islamic theology', 'Tafsīr studies', 'Human rights discourse', 'Religious pluralism', 'Islam and minorities']"

Militant Democracies in Europe,"Rood, Amber van","['Joost, Augusteijn']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since the end of the Second World War the discussion on the defensibility of democracies has become gradually more prevalent. This thesis sought to answer the question; To what extent are parties in Europe banned on basis of the concept of a militant democracy? First, the concept “militant democracy” was defined. This was done by analysing the aim, definition, measures and enemies of a militant democracy as outlined by five renowned academics in the field. Namely, Loewenstein (1937), Sajó (2004), Giovanni (2005), Thiel (2009) and Müller (2016/2018). Secondly, party ban cases in Germany, The Czech Republic, Latvia, The Netherlands and Spain were considered. First it was considered whether there were laws in place that aimed at protecting the democracy by targeting enemies of a militant democracy. Secondly, jurisprudence was analysed to see whether these laws were applied with the aim of protecting the democracy and targeting enemies of a militant democracy. If both were found to be the case; a party ban could be considered an act of a militant democracy. Thirdly, the political discourse around the party proscription was scrutinized to gather more information about the reasons for the ban. This was done by reviewing newspaper articles. The German and Czech cases were found to be examples of a militant democracy. Latvia indirectly acted as a militant democracy. The Dutch and Spanish cases were no examples of militant democracy. The political reasons for the party ban fell in line with the judicial reasons. In case of the Dutch and Spanish party ban, the government had additional motives for banning the party concerning the country’s future.","['Militant Democracy', 'Europe', 'Party ban', 'Party proscription', 'Democracy', 'Germany', 'The Netherlands', 'The Czech Republic', 'Latvia', 'Spain', ""CP' 86"", 'Socialist Reich Party', 'Marxist Leninist Communist Party', 'Workers’ Party', 'Batasuna', 'Herri Batasuna', 'Euskal Herritarrok', 'ETA']"

Russian-Lithuanian energy relations since 2014: Russia's use of its energy weapon after the Baltic country gained 'independence',"Galiën, Anna van der","['Frear, M.J.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Russische Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Lithuania gained more energy independence from Russia after building the Floating Storage Regasification Unit Independence (FSRU Independence) in Klaipėda in 2014. Diversification meant that Lithuania being solely reliant on Russian energy changed and therefore, possibly Russia’s foreign energy policy towards Lithuania as well. This could indicate that Russia might not have used its well-known energy weapon in Lithuania’s domestic energy politics after 2014. This study therefore has as research question: What elements of Russia’s foreign energy policy has Russia used with regard to Lithuania’s domestic energy politics since 2014? The research argues that Russia has not effectively or not at all resorted to using elements of its foreign energy policy with regard to Lithuania’s domestic energy politics after 2014. Russia rather has attempted to reduce Lithuania’s larger leverage over Russia than Russia had on Lithuania in the last few years. Clearly, the identified elements of Russia’s foreign energy policy were not applicable after Lithuania’s diversification of energy and therefore, Russia should probably resort to new foreign policy tools in the future in case if it is willing to influence Lithuania’s domestic energy politics again.","['Russia', 'Lithuania', 'energy', 'energy independence', 'energy weapon']"

Coffee Trade and Development,"Duclos, Arthur J.G.","['Amann, Edmund']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Coffee is one of the most traded commodities in the World and accounts for around 36.5 Billion US dollars’ worth of trade, according to the UN (2017, 180). It is a widely democratized beverage in western societies nowadays, with the largest importers in the World being the EU and the US. How can coffee trade contribute to both the development of the Latin American countries and the empowerment of its small producers? The aim of this paper is to provide practical solutions that can be implemented to empower the producers, at each of the stages of the coffee supply chain. Within the framework of the New Rural Development paradigm, this paper finds that producing countries should help the individual producers by providing an enabling environment for better producing conditions and should coordinate with other producing countries to, again, strengthen their negotiating power vis-à-vis developed consuming countries. The consuming countries, in turn, should not hinder the development of the producing countries with discriminatory import tariffs and should instead provide the legal and executive framework allowing producing countries to develop themselves. Finally, individual consumers should voice their support for better living conditions for the coffee producers by buying products from sustainable supply chains.","['Coffee Trade', 'Empowerment', 'Latin America', 'Commodities Trade', 'Sustainable Rural Development', 'Coffee Producer', 'Fair Trade', 'Brazil', 'Global Value Chain', 'Coffee Supply Chain']"
A crumbling fortress is our God: The maintenance mechanisms of the Dutch reformatory community,"Brouwer, Ids Willem Frederik","['Davidsen, Markus Altena']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Theology and Religious Studies (Master),Master thesis,en,"This research question relates Meerten and Berend ter Borg’s maintenance mechanisms to the tensions within the reformatoric community while acknowledging the existence of different approaches among the pillar’s elite. I dedicate specific attention to the identification of three general patterns. In the first place, I identify the location and nature of the disturbances facing the reformatoric community. I differentiate between primary and secondary disturbances to indicate whether these arise from outside (primary) or within (secondary) the pillar. In the second place, I comment on the choice and use of maintenance mechanisms. Opposing integration and defence mechanisms that are based on the same shared element tend to be invoked during discussions concerning the community’s future. Moreover, some mechanisms have greater salience in the community’s context due to their rooting within its ontological framework. In the third place, I analyse the differences between the pillar’s progressive and conservative factions. I highlight that their differentiated use of maintenance mechanisms stems from their differentiated identification of disturbances. I conclude with a brief reflection on the three innovations I propose to Ter Borg and Ter Borg’s framework: the identification of shared elements among opposing integration and defence mechanisms, the introduction of judgment and expulsion as theodicy’s defensive counterpart, and the classification and influence of disturbances on the use of maintenance mechanisms.","['fundamentalism', 'religion', 'reformed', 'religious fundamentalism', 'maintenance mechanisms', 'sociology of religion']"

Foreign Aid and its Effectiveness in Reducing Poverty in the Republic of Nicaragua,"Laan, Christina van der","['Amann, E.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In Nicaragua, the field of development aid has undergone a considerable change over the last decades. The donor landscape has become more diverse, and the types and compositions of aid have changed. As a result of a radical new direction that was taken by the latest Nicaraguan government in which country ownership became a more central focus to development, many traditional aid donors have scaled down their aid to Nicaragua, while emerging donors, mainly Venezuela, have become increasingly involved as providers of largely unconditional aid. This paper researches how effective project aid, budget support and Venezuelan aid to Nicaragua have been in lowering poverty levels, by testing these on the factors of conditionality, alignment with the recipient government’s objectives, harmonisation and country ownership. On the basis of these four factors, this research finds that both project aid and budget support have generally had limited effects in Nicaragua, whereas Venezuelan aid seems to have had more significant effects on reducing poverty levels.","['Foreign aid', 'Nicaragua', 'aid effectiveness', 'conditionality', 'Venezuela']"

It starts with a re-examination of earlier models, mainly the Zealot model and the social banditry model. Due to dissatisfaction with both major models, it continues by seeing latrocinium as a means used by both regional strongmen and Palestinian peasant communities to fulfil economic, social, and political goals. Peasants entered into patronal relations with regional strongmen and performed latrocinium-like activities for the former in exchange for protection against subsistence crises and external enemies. The regional strongmen on the other hand, used their leistai to strengthen their own position in society. This study looks at how latrocinium worked in Early Roman Palestine and how it penetrated into all levels of society. Furthermore, making use of both the model developed in this study and the model of multi-polar network-centric insurgency, it proposes a new way of looking at the First Jewish War (66-74AD) and at the role of leistai within this event.","['Leistai', 'Latrocinium', 'Early Roman Palestine', 'Flavius Josephus', 'Multi-polar network-centric insurgencies', 'Social banditry', 'Zealot model', 'Patronage', 'Rural survival', 'Jewish (Civil) War']"

The Effect of Bilingualism on Frisian-Dutch Children’s Reading: An Eye-Tracking Study,"Nota, Naomi","['Bosma, Evelyn']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Bilingual adults are faster at reading cognates than non-cognates in both their first (L1) (Van Assche et al., 2009) and second language (L2) (Duyck et al., 2007). This cognate effect has been shown to be gradual in the L1: recognition was facilitated when words had higher degrees of cross-lingual similarity (Van Assche et al., 2009). Many studies on bilingual language processing have used this effect to indicate a co-activation of lexical representations in two languages. Recent research has shown that the gradual cognate facilitation effect can also be found in bilingual children’s receptive vocabulary (Bosma et al., 2016). However, it is still unknown to what extent it can be found in bilingual children’s reading. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether cognate facilitation can also be observed in bilingual children’s reading. To answer this question, Frisian-Dutch bilinguals (n = 18) between 9 and 12 years old performed a reading task in both of their languages. All children had Dutch as their dominant reading language, but most of them spoke mainly Frisian at home. Identical cognates (e.g., boek-boek ‘book’), non-identical cognates (e.g., beam-boom ‘tree’), and non-cognates (e.g., beppe-oma ‘grandmother’) were presented in a sentence context, and eye-movements were recorded. The results showed a non-gradual cognate facilitation effect in Frisian: identical cognates were read faster than non-identical cognates and non-cognates.

Artificial or Natural: An Investigation of the Syntax of Negation in Game of Thrones’ Dothraki,"Leeuwen, Julia van","['Lipták, Anikó']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Dothraki, one of the fictional languages that features in HBO’s Emmy-award winning TV series Game of Thrones, resembles a natural language in many ways. This thesis is an empirical syntactical investigation into one of the language’s more idiosyncratic features, namely its double marking of negation. A corpus of 46 negative Dothraki sentences was analysed to determine the position of negation with in a sentence. These results were discussed in reference to a number of theories on the syntax of negation in natural languages. This was done with the ultimate aim of discovering whether negation in Dothraki adheres to the syntactical patterns of natural languages, or whether it is constructed differently and in that way evidence of the language’s artificiality. This thesis ultimately concludes that the double marking of negation in Dothraki can be accounted for by existing theories based on negation in natural languages, arguing that Dothraki resembles languages like Berber in that NegP is the left-most phrase in the split-IP, with the subject in the specifier of TopP.","['negation', 'fictional languages', 'artificial languages', 'Game of Thrones', 'Dothraki', 'corpus linguistics', 'natural languages']"

EU's response to the threat of backsliding democracies,"Eetgerink, Katinka","['Rood, Jan']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This article investigates which factors cause the difference in EU response towards the governments of Hungary and Poland. The incumbent Hungarian and Polish administrations have changed their constitutional system that put the independence of the judiciary and respect for the European rule of law values at risk. The EU has responded differently in Hungary and Poland regarding the rule of law and independence of judiciary. The Treaties however, provide the obligation for EU institutions to treat all member states equally. This research follows a contextual research design and a comparative case study analysis to identify the factors that could explain the difference in the EU response. The research results show that the difference in EU response could be explained via party group protection, timing of the reforms, lessons learned by the EU and the domestic support for the EU. This research draws four key conclusions. First, the level of party group protection within the European Parliament decreases the effect of criticism on a member state’s government. Second, when a member state reforms its constitutional system, a well-timed strategy can reduce EU- interference. Third, EU’s learned lessons contributed to a different approach to member states that threaten the respect for the rule of law. Fourth, the level of domestic EU-support increases the chances of EU interference in a member state. The pro-EU citizens could serve as a buffer for EU interventions.",['European Union Hungary Poland']
The Porcelain Rooms of Mary Stuart at Het Loo and Hampton Court: Legacies of the Orange princesses and Mary’s creativity,"Ashikari, Ayumi","['Keblusek, Marika']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on the porcelain rooms of Mary Stuart (1662-1694), the wife of William III of Orange (1650-1702), at Het Loo and Hampton Court that housed Asian porcelain and its imitation, Delft porcelain. The porcelain rooms introduced by the Orange princesses were the basis of Mary’s way of display, with regard to some decorative elements and the different types of the rooms according the function of the porcelain. She also added her original touch to the previous manner of porcelain display in collaboration with French designer Daniel Marot the Elder (1661-1752). The client Mary’s personal taste must not be underestimated. Her own creativity was expressed by the unconventional way of mixing her two major interests - oriental porcelain and plants. Through the newly designed Delft wares, fresh flowers came into the porcelain rooms in unprecedented manner and oriental porcelain came into the garden; they mutually worked together and formed a unified whole. This research provides us with a new aspect of early modern women’s contribution to creating domestic culture from ingredients that came from different regions.","['Mary Stuart', 'Mary II', 'porcelain', 'Het Loo', 'Hampton Court', 'House of Orange', 'Daniel Marot', 'chinoiserie', 'Delft blue']"

Franz Joseph utilised? Why the concept of Kaisertreue in the Austro-Hungarian Empire should be reinterpreted from an anational and national perspective based on two Kaiserreisen to Galicia in 1880 and 1894,"Bakhuis, Niels Jasper","['Baár, Monika']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Ever since Oscar Jászi’s thesis on opposing centripetal versus centrifugal forces within the Austro-Hungarian empire, historians have perceived developments within the Dual Monarchy through a dichotomous lens without questioning this assumed mutual exclusivity. This has led to singular interpretations of imperial loyalty, Kaisertreue, as a purely centripetal, read imperial, force. While new studies have shown that the opposition between nationalism and imperial identity is much more complex and that in some cases they could be compatible and even mutually supportive, this has not led to a new interpretation of Kaisertreue. Through an analysis of the promotion of Kaisertreue during two imperial visits to Galicia in 1880 and 1894, this thesis argues that the ruling Polish conservatives nationalised dynastic loyalty in order to support their nationalist visions and policies for Galicia, while at the same time the Habsburg Court continued to promote an anational Kaisertreue based on the equality of all nations, languages, and cultures. This reinterpretation helps historians to better understand the complexities of imperial-nationalist dynamics and therefore offer better explanations of developments within Austria-Hungary.","['Austria-Hungary', 'Franz Joseph', 'Kaisertreue', 'Galicia', 'National Identity', 'Supranational Identity', 'Kaiserreisen']"

Since laryngeal developments are amongst the earliest phonological developments in both Italic and Celtic, they could shed more light on the evolution of these branches shortly after Proto-Indo-European started disintegrating, and in particular on the possibility of a shared Italo-Celtic stage. This thesis analyzes Celtic and Italic laryngeal developments in three specific environments that have often been connected to the Italo-Celtic question: laryngeals after vowels in pretonic syllables (Dybo’s Law), laryngeals between consonants in word internal syllables, and laryngeals in CRHC clusters. On the basis of these, it is concluded that laryngeal developments offer some possible shared Italo-Celtic developments, and no strong arguments against an Italo-Celtic linguistic unity. The final chapter of the thesis proposes a chronology of laryngeal related sound changes that could explain both the similarities and the divergences between Italic and Celtic.","['Laryngeals', 'Italo-Celtic', 'Italic', 'Celtic', ""Dybo's Law""]"

Diplocat & Scotland Europa The role of regional governments in semi-public organisations conducting sub-state diplomacy,"Belhaj Chankour, Mohamed Amin","['Shaev, Brian']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The European Union is directly affected by political crises within member states. One of the challenges many of the member countries face comes in the form of secessionism. The secessionist sentiment in Europe is especially felt in the United Kingdom and Spain. Whereby secessionism has been able to move to the political mainstream. This thesis has sought to analyse in accordance to the framework of Mechanics of Cultural diplomacy: A comparative case.” (Kizlari & Fouseki, 2017) how regional secessionist governments have instrumentalised semi-public institutions to conduct sub-state diplomacy. The thesis analyses the legal mandate, the operational structure of Scotland Europa and Diplocat to discover whether they subjected to the direct influence of their respective regional governments. Subsequently, the thesis analyses the frames employed by the organisations in their communications to understand the objective of their publications in order to conclude how regional governments instrumentalised them. The analysis demonstrates that in both the Catalan and Scottish case the organisations were indeed instrumentalised to conduct sub-state diplomacy. Yet, the objectives were different. On one hand the Catalans sought to internationalise their self-determination effort and appealed to the European Union to mediate in the national conflict. On the other hand, the Scottish government has sought to influence EU decision making through more conventional channels such as consultation responses and the publication of papers. Finally, it has become clear that both the Catalan and Scottish government see European Union membership as a crucial part of their independence.","['European Union', 'Catalonia', 'Scotland', 'Separatism', 'Diplocat', 'Scotland Europa', 'Independency', 'Self-determination', 'Sub-state diplomacy']"

Grendel’s Mother: Monster or Noble Warrior-Lady?,"Alexander, Suliandri","['Porck, Thijs']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Some scholars label Grendel’s mother as a demonic monster (e.g., Puhvel 2006, 11-14). The Beowulf- characters certainly do not seem to appreciate Grendel’s mother. In contrast, Beowulf is celebrated. This is odd, because his actions and Grendel’s mother’s actions are similar. The literary term abjection can be used to explain this difference in appreciation. The abject is what the culture throws away, its garbage, or its waste products (see Kristeva 1982; Klages 2012, 11). Paul Acker (2006) uses this theory to argue that Grendel’s mother is the abject. But Grendel’s mother may not be inherently monstrous. Current research has shown more sympathy for Grendel’s mother and her role in Beowulf by pointing out that her perceived monstrosity is to blame on modern translators, lexicographers and literary critics (see Alfano 1992; Hennequin 2008). In fact, the Beowulf-poet describes Grendel’s mother in terms similar to Beowulf. Thus far, scholars have often overlooked these similarities and what we can be made of them. This thesis argues that the similarities between Grendel’s mother and Beowulf underscore the poet’s criticism of heroic structures. Rather than Grendel’s mother as the abject, it is the heroic structures that are the abject. By pointing out the similarities and what they imply, this thesis shows that the term ‘monster’ assigned to Grendel’s mother can easily be applied to Beowulf too, because their behavior is similar.","[""Grendel's mother"", 'Beowulf', 'Abject', 'Monster', 'Heroic structures', 'Abjection', 'Criticism']"
‘THE ORIGINS OF POPULISM’: THE VALIDITY OF PREVAILING ACADEMIC THESES CONCERNING SUPPORT FOR RIGHT WING POPULIST MOVEMENTS IN WESTERN EUROPE,"Baldacchino, Ian","['Paul, Herman']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The growing prevalence and popularity of Right Wing Populist organisations and figures across much of Western Europe remains one of the most pertinent political issues in the region. Through the successful exploitation of a controversial ideology broadly concerned with national sovereignty, nativism, and anti-elitism, Right Wing Populists have been able secure increasingly larger segments of the electorate and thus enter the political mainstream in many European countries. The recentness and rapidity of this phenomenon has spurred a great deal of popular and media interest. Much of this has been wholly negative, defined by explicit comparisons of Right Wing Populists to 20th century totalitarians and lengthy critiques about the perceived dangers of their platforms. Within Academia, several new theses have emerged which seek to account for these movements and extrapolate the underlying conditions fuelling their rise. This dissertation demonstrates how many of these academic theses, despite their modernity and differing conclusions, echo strands of functionalist and anti-popular mentalities that were prominent in the early half of the early 20th century. More specifically, due to their focus on economic and demographic factors as being the primary motivating force behind support for Right Wing Populism, they mirror Hannah Arendt’s conceptualisation of the ‘Masses’, whereby she claims that 20th century totalitarian movements were only able to secure power through the mobilisation of a large body of citizenry which had been rendered identity-less and embittered as a result of the rapid social and economic changes witnessed during the preceding century. By doing so, these do two things. Firstly, they tacitly agree with popular claims that these movements are the spiritual successors to 20th century totalitarians. Secondly, by ignoring or downplaying potential ideological or cultural conditions, such theses serve to delegitimise and trivialise support for Right Wing Populist movements, thus constricting political discourse. In response, this dissertation argues, using a number of comparative case studies chosen according to the least-similar case design as defined by Christopher Lamont, that these materialist understandings of the support for Right Wing Populists and, by extension, the various assumptions from which they derive, have lost much of their validity in the 21st century. Rather, this dissertation puts forward that support for these organisations is for the most part the consequence of preexisting cultural and historical factors, combined with rational self-interest, which persist across generations regardless of material changes. Fulfilment of this aim is fundamental as it encourages policy makers to re-assess their preconceived notions of Right-Wing Populists and consequently develop a more all-rounded understanding of them, which in turn allows the production of more relevant and effective positions to address the social conditions stimulating their growth.","['Populism', 'Arendt', 'Mass', 'Society', 'Right-Wing']"

Verrekte linkse teringtrol - Onderzoek naar beledigingen op online forum GeenStijl rond de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen 2018,"Geer, Moniek van der","['Naerssen, Maaike van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Nederlandse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Taalgebruikers kunnen op veel manieren bedoeld onbeleefd zijn. Een manier daarvan is door beledigingen te gebruiken. Een context waarin dat veel gebeurt, is de informele discussie. Mensen gebruiken beledigingen om een fysieke confrontatie te vermijden (Collins, 2008). Een situatie waarin de fysieke confrontatie sowieso uitblijft, is op het internet, wat de verwachting schept dat mensen feller reageren op elkaar. Het masker dat het internet opwerpt, zorgt namelijk voor een verhoogde kans op verbale agressie (Moore et al., 2012). Ik heb me in dit werkstuk gericht op internetforum GeenStijl, en op bijdragen op artikelen over de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen 2018. GeenStijl is een forum waar ik beledigingen dacht tegen te komen, door zijn onbeleefde imago. Ook verwachtte ik beledigingen in opmerkingen over de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen, door de verschillende politieke achtergronden van gebruikers. Beide verwachtingen zijn uitgekomen. In dit werkstuk heb ik een antwoord proberen te geven op de hoofdvraag: Hoe worden beledigingen op het online forum GeenStijl ingezet, in bijdragen op topics over de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen 2018? Met de uitkomsten van het onderzoek tracht ik de relatief jonge literatuur over beledigingen aan te vullen op het gebied van internetfora, en meer grip te krijgen op het gebruik van beledigingen. Om op deze hoofdvraag een antwoord te formuleren, heb ik twee deelvragen beantwoord: Wat voor beledigingen zijn er met name te vinden op het forum?’ en ‘Hoe reageren gebruikers op de beledigingen?’. De antwoorden: veel van de beledigingen zijn gericht op het (lage) IQ van gebruikers. Ook worden gebruikers vaak buiten de ‘normale groep’ geplaatst: door een belediging te doen geven beledigers eigenlijk aan dat een gebruiker er niet bij hoort. Beledigende uitingen als schelden en sarcasme worden ook gebruikt in de opmerkingen, en dragen bij aan het onbeleefde imago van het forum. De gebruikers hebben op verschillende manieren gereageerd op de beledigingen, maar de strategie die het vaakst voorkwam is niet reageren. Het is lastig te bepalen wat de reden hiervoor is geweest, het kan komen doordat het doelwit de belediging niet zo ervaart, hij niet weet wat hij ermee aan moet, of simpelweg omdat het ‘moment’ voorbij is. Hoewel minder in aantal, komen tegenaanvallen ook voor, zowel offensief als defensief. Beledigingen lijken ingezet te worden om bepaalde gebruikers uit te sluiten van de wenselijke of normale groep. Soms lijkt het echter ook alsof de gebruikers elkaar simpelweg zo aanspreken, wat niet als belediging wordt gezien - eerder als bevestiging van de normen van de groep. Om hier een zekere uitspraak over te kunnen doen, moet daar nog verder onderzoek naar gedaan worden, in een gecontroleerde omgeving en over langere tijdspanne.","['beledigingen', 'onbeleefdheid', 'online forum', 'insults', 'Culpeper', 'Jay']"
Von abenteuern bis zwitschern: Die Form und Bedeutung von deutschen Verben auf,"Rijnenberg, Anne-Marie","['Audring, Jenny']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,de,"In this thesis I examine the form and meaning of German verbs ending in -ern. This verbal suffix is not productive and not much has been written about it. Fleisch & Barz (2012: 430 f.) ascribe a few functions to the ending -ern: The first is iterativity, for example in blickern. The second is an onomatopoeic function as in blubbern. The –(e)r(n) could also find its basis in a noun, like Bäcker. Verbs with -ern bare many similarities to verbs ending in -eln. About these latter some recent literature can be found. The -ern-verbs however remain unresearched. In grammars verbs ending in -ern, when mentioned at all, are ascribed iterativity. However, this is not always the case. In this thesis I have researched the origins of -ern of unprefixed verbs out of the CELEX corpus and determine if these are nominal, verbal or in some cases even adjectival by checking their etymology in several dictionaries (Duden Online , Kluge 2011, Pfeifer e. a. 1989). I have looked if a specific meaning can be attributed to a specific sort of -ern, by listing and comparing the semantics of the researched verbs. This meaning could be iterativity, but also attenuation, which is the case for some verbs ending in -eln (cf. Audring, Booij & Jackendoff 2017). If verbs with a nominal -ern have an iterative meaning, this could also mean that the iterative meaning is not limited to the verbal -ern. Also, it might be possible that the verbs could be assigned a certain Aktionsart.","['German', 'Suffix', 'Semantics', 'Aktionsart', 'Verbs']"

The Portrayal of South Korean Colonial History,"Brand, Marjolein van den","['Mostert, T.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"South Korea had started the official commemoration of certain parts of the Japanese occupation period as early as 1949, four year after the liberation of 1945. While certain parts of the occupation period are commemorated, others are left out. In order to gain insight with regard to how the topic of the occupation period is generally portrayed in South Korea, the author has researched how the Japanese occupation period is presented in South Korean museums specifically by using three case studies: the Seoul Museum of History, the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History and Seodaemun Prison History Hall. Within these museums the author specifically focused on the information panels that these museums displayed in their exhibitions, as well as information presented in the museums’ brochures and official websites. In examining these three collections, with a specific focus on the display of ‘text’, the author attempts to answer the question: “What can the portrayal of texts included in museum exhibitions on the occupation period teach us about the way this period is presented in South Korea?”","['Museums', 'South Korea', 'Colonial History', 'Japanese Occupation']"

Daarbij wordt het onderzoek van Sato & Hodge (2015) als voorbeeld gebruikt voor dit onderzoek en daarmee vergeleken. Er wordt onderzocht of de sociale interacties met medestudenten van invloed kunnen zijn op de academische prestaties, de ervaring van de uitwisseling zelf en of het zelfbeeld veranderd zou zijn tijdens de uitwisseling (Young et al., 2015). Uit onderzoeken blijkt namelijk dat Aziatische uitwisselingsstudenten zich vaak buitengesloten, geïsoleerd en gediscrimineerd voelen. De resultaten van dit onderzoek zijn vergaard uit interviews die gevoerd zijn met zes Japanse deelnemers (drie mannen en drie vrouwen) die een 1-jarige uitwisseling doen. De Japanse uitwisselingsstudenten in Leiden beleven een andere ervaring dan Japanse uitwisselingsstudenten in Amerika.

"From Monstrous Parent to Monstrous Child: Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" and the Romantic-Era Nature/Nurture Debate","Lindhout, Saskia Kirsten","['Leeuwen, Evert Jan van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores the Romantic-era nature/nurture debate as represented in Gothic fiction, by examining the representation in Frankenstein of Mary Shelley’s standpoint regarding the significance of nurture for human mental development. In Frankenstein, Mary Shelley explores the role of parenting and education in the formation of individual identity. Frankenstein is first analysed in relation to the work of Shelley's parents regarding parenting, upbringing and education. Shelley's representation of the malleability of children is examined, after which Frankenstein's creature is read as a Female Gothic victim-heroine, in order to demonstrate how Shelley extends existing Gothic conventions to illustrate her beliefs regarding the influence of upbringing on the formation of individual identity. Finally, this thesis explores the role of the cult of domesticity on Frankenstein, in order to complete its analysis of Shelley's intellectual standpoint regarding the importance of nurture for the formation of individual identity. Shelley is shown to take up an intellectual position between the radical egalitarianism of her parents and her husband, that stresses nurture above everything else, and the more conventional – Christian – wisdom concerning human development as exemplified in Ann Radcliffe’s Female Gothic romances. Frankenstein shows that even though sociopolitical institutions have the power to corrupt individuals, the individuals have the responsibility to act according to their conscience.","['Mary Shelley', 'Frankenstein', 'Nature/nurture debate', 'Sicilian Romance', 'Gothic', 'Female Gothic', 'Victim-heroine', 'Parenting', 'Education', 'Upbringing']"

The cultural importance of Karol Lanckoronski (1848-1933) as a last genuine humanist around 1900 and his collection in Vienna,"Michniewicz, Marta","['Keblusek, Marika']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"When we think about Vienna around 1900, our first associations with this period are fin-de-siècle and the establishment of the Art Nouveau period. Moreover, it was a time of blossoming cultural life during the greatest period of the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The main goal of Viennese Art Nouveau was to supplant the entrenched historical styles with modern, bourgeois and Austrian style. Furthermore, the main concept of the Art Nouveau was to strive for a style unity in every possible field of art. The architecture and decorative arts of the Sezessionsstil were much appreciated by Viennese cultural circles. The Austrian cultural centre subsequently became a home to this type of art, since 1900. There emerged two primary art associations called Sezession established in 1897 by Gustav Klimt (1862-1918), and Wiener Werkstätte, begun in 1903 by Josef Hoffman (1870-1956). Klimt’s paintings are characterised by applied influences of symbolic paintings of Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, elements of Egyptian paintings, Byzantine mosaics and Japanese art. The essence of those factors can be found in later Klimt paintings such as The Kiss (1907-1908). The architect Josef Hoffman on the other hand, was operating with straight lines and geometrical figures. One of the most eminent projects ascribed to Hoffman is the Sanatorium in Purkersdorf (1903-1904) and the Palais Stocklet in Brussels (1905-1911). Notably, Sezession became an opposition to academic art and 19th century eclecticism. The main objective of this style was to break with historicism and focus on nature instead. However, along with Art Nouveau, Vienna also took a traditional approach to art and collecting, understood as creating a collection based on early modern Italian and Renaissance art as well as on Dutch Golden Age paintings. International connections, such as a good flow of information on sales and the developing art trade in a specific period enabled many collectors to purchase a good number of old master paintings. Among the Viennese collectors captivated by Renaissance art, Karol Lanckoroński (1848-1933) is the eminent example of a collector, who managed to create an incredibly interesting and broad collection, as we will see in following chapters.","['Vienna', 'Karol Lanckoroński', 'Polish collector', 'Private collection', '1900', 'Vienna cultural circle', 'Humanist', 'Italian Renaissance artworks', '17th century Dutch artworks']"

The Role of the House in Facilitating Female Agency in the 19th and Early 20th Century Novel,"Parkinson, Sophie","['Newton, Michael']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This essay will focus on the ways in which the house, and indeed the right to own property, shaped female experience in The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1843), The Spoils of Poynton (1897) and Howard’s End (1910). The relationship between houses and female power will be explored through three chapters. The first will focus on The Tenant of Wildfell Hall and will examine the relevance of the house as a physical space within women’s lives. The second will look at The Spoils of Poynton in the context of female homelessness, shedding light on the importance of the female home in wielding power, as women without property are left disenfranchised throughout, as well as the precarious nature of female inhabitance of the home. The third and final chapter will examine Howard’s End in light of this. Women, able to take full ownership of the home, are able to exert control over their environment and exercise a relatively high degree of independence. Howard’s End, then, I will examine in terms of legal female ownership of the house and female inheritance. This essay will examine the role of the house in female agency within the novel, and how these novels emerge from, and form part of, the shifting political, social and legal context of the 19th Century.","['Victorian', 'Edwardian', 'Feminism', 'House', 'Forster', 'Bronte', 'James']"

Bij een kwestie die racisme en discriminatie in de hand zouden kunnen spelen, is het dus van belang te kijken hoe media Joden framen en hoe het vernaculaire web (de verzameling van nieuwsgroepen, blogs, wiki’s, lezersreacties, sociale netwerken en andere fora op het wereldwijde web, zie paragraaf 2.2.), hierop reageert. Dit onderzoek is gedaan aan de hand van een kwalitatieve inductieve framinganalyse, waarbij er is gekeken naar frames die voorkomen op de NOS, in het Algemeen Dagblad en in de Volkskrant. In de media werden er drie frames gehanteerd: het slachtofferframe (Joden ondervinden last van antisemitisme en de nasleep van de Holocaust); het religieframe (orthodox-Jodendom staat haaks op westerse normen en waarden en het totum-pro-parteframe (Israël is een compleet Joodse staat en alle Joden op de wereld zijn Israëli). Uit de Facebookdiscussies waren vijf frames te destilleren: eveneens het religieframe; het slachtofferframe; het conflictframe (Joden zijn verantwoordelijk voor het Israël-Palestinaconflict); het complotframe (Joden trekken achter de schermen aan de touwtjes) en het frame waarin antisemitisme de schuld van de islam is. Opvallend is dat er twee frames zijn die zowel in de media als op het vernaculaire web te vinden zijn, maar dat het slachtofferframe ook tegengesproken wordt. Hoewel de media een goede spreiding van frames hanteert, komt het conflictframe het meest naar voren in de Facebookreacties.","['antisemitisme', 'joden', 'Israël', 'framing', 'matrix', 'NOS', 'Algemeen Dagblad', 'Volkskrant', 'Facebook', 'vernaculaire web']"

How Does Sense Memory Create Affect in Charlotte Delbo’s Auschwitz and After?,"Mynett, Abigail","['Ksenia, Robbe']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Auschwitz and After by Charlotte Delbo, can take the reader into a place of memory that monuments and art cannot. Her narratives, extracts, and poetry do not use a linear timeline that make a coherent story. Instead, Delbo fills her narratives with recollections of bodily suffering, which are infused with the smells, tastes, and sights of what she experienced in Auschwitz. With the plethora of Holocaust testimonies that are available today, Delbo’s Auschwitz and After is particularly influential because of its ability to show the reader through visual techniques the stark differences between bodily and sensory functions in Auschwitz when compared to the outside world. This confers a unique visual effect, which has haunted readers and academics. This has motivated them to examine Delbo’s work in further detail. This thesis, looks at what affect the use of sense memory in Charlotte Delbo’s Auschwitz and After has on the reader. It argues, that through sense memory the reader initially believes they have begun to understand the realities of Auschwitz. This is because they can liken the sensory and bodily functions to their own experiences. However, Delbo deconstructs these familiar aspects and pushes the reader into the realms of her Auschwitz experience. The reader can see the stark contrasts between the familiar meanings, and the new experience that Delbo has granted to them. This thesis looks into representations of sense memory within Auschwitz and After and how it creates affect in the reader","['Holocaust', 'Memoir', 'Charlotte Delbo']"
Censorship in Consistency: The Case of Chinese Contemporary Art (2004-2014),"Bottacini, Giovanni","['Zijlmans, Catherine']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Artistic freedom of expression has always been a hot topic both in the West and in the East. It is enough to think about the controversy of Richard Serra against the US government regarding the removal of Tilted Arc (1981) from the Federal Plaza in New York City in 1989 or the shutting down, in 2017, of the controversial Guggenheim “Art and China after 1989: Theatre of the World” exhibitions featuring abused animals. In the case of China, the issue becomes more complicated, because of what some perceive as the systematic censorship of everything that goes against the government’s narrative and criticizes it. But is this actually always the case? During my research, I encountered the book of a New York art journalist, Barbara Pollack, who for a ten-year long research focused on the Chinese contemporary art market. Here, she discussed the case of artist Wang Qingsong, arrested for pornography in 2006 and Chi Peng, an artist who made naked self-portraits having sexual intercourse in the same period but was reportedly never arrested. The author also reports of a conversation with former head of the National Art Museum of China (NAMOC), Feng Yuan, who specifies the “Four Nos” which would, according to him, always cause the censoring of art in China: “no pornography, no violence, no attacking the government or making fun of political leaders.” From this, a question spontaneously arises: “Why do some artist get censored and others do not, even while violating the Nos in similar ways?” In this research I focused on censored art in the period of the Harmonious Society Policy (2004-2014). Following from this, my research question is “Do censors’ and artists’ discourses from 2004 to 2014 suggest consistency and continuity in the enforcement of the Chinese art censorship or not?” This question’s answer will help define the state of art censorship in China in the abovementioned period, but also its development from the previous decades and into the current state. In order to research this issue, I will have to answer two sub-questions: “What elements of the artists’ and officials’ discourses could have caused the censorship?” This question is aimed at understanding what triggers censorship in controversial cases. The second one is “What elements of the artists’ and officials’ discourses could have helped them in avoiding censorship?” Thus, I will be discussing the possible triggering factors for censoring art works and the elements that saved other artworks from censorship by searching into primary and secondary documents. The case studies are censored and not censored artworks for each policy core concept exhibited in the period between 2004 and 2014. The case studies are solely regarding controversies (or the absence thereof) for artworks exhibited in Mainland China. The case studies are the following: Ren Hang’s Untitled (2012), Liu Wei’s It Looks Like a Landscape (2004) on the topic of pornography, Zhang Huan’s Giant no. 1-2-3 (2008), He Yunchang’s One Meter of Democracy (2010), for the topic of violence and Cao Fei’s RMB City: a Second Life City Planning (2007) and Zhang Dali’s Second History: Chairman Mao Reviews the Red Guards, 1966 (2005), regarding political criticism.","['contemporary art', 'Chinese art', 'Chinese', 'Art censorship', 'China', 'contemporary Chinese art', 'harmonious society', 'pornography', 'violence', 'political criticism']"

The Rise of Regionalist Parties in Europe: Between Domestic and European factors,"Deursen, Hans van","['Shaev, Brian']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The process of European integration has created a multilevel federal polity in which regionalist parties can thrive. The European Union (EU) significantly reduced the cost of autonomy and independence for regions, as it provides a viable alternative to belonging to a central state. Consequently, regionalist parties are more viable in the eyes of the electorate. Moreover, the EU has created a space that Member States cannot fully control. These two factors have thus contributed to the rise of regionalist parties in Europe. However, this cannot account for the discrepancies in electoral success between regionalist parties across Europe. This thesis seeks to account for these discrepancies by analysing the relative importance of domestic factors on the rise of regionalist parties. In that pursuit, this thesis compares Catalonia and Friesland. In Catalonia, domestic factors provided the momentum for the rise of regionalist parties, but European integration made them viable. In Friesland, the opposite holds true. Domestic variables and, in part, European integration itself, inhibited the rise of the Frisian Nationalist Party. European integration is therefore only relevant in relation to domestic factors and vice versa. As such, only an integrated approach can adequately account for the rise of regionalist parties in Europe.","['European Integration', 'The EU', 'Regionalist Parties']"

"Squaring the Circle: American Policy on establishing the European Defense Community, 1950-1954","Vis, Andreas Theodoor","['Richard, A.I.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This Master’s thesis aspires to illuminate the historiographical disagreement on US Secretary of State Dean Acheson’s role in the ‘single package’, and explain this American proposal’s role in initiating the European Defense Community (EDC) project. Furthermore, this paper argues that Washington’s ‘single package’ strategy does fit into John Lewis Gaddis’ model of US alliance management, because it can be regarded as an exception within this model. The research question of this thesis is: to what extent was the EDC initiated by the US and what was their intended aim with the EDC? In order to be able to answer that question, particularly the French government’s role in the EDC affair and its intended aim with the EDC also has to be taken into account. The first chapter will discuss the American position on, and involvement in, the EDC initiative, until the announcement of the Pleven Plan. It will also consider the Containment strategy and the historiography on the ‘single package’ proposal. The second chapter will discuss the French position on, and involvement in, the EDC initiative, until the Pleven Plan. Because this paper’s research question focuses on Washington’s role concerning the EDC, the second chapter will primarily illuminate how France’s position on a European army related to the American position. It also discusses the historiography on France and ‘the German problem.’ For instance, this thesis disputes Michael Creswell and Marc Trachtenberg’s argument that Paris was not somehow forced to accept a US policy for Germany which France totally opposed, and disagrees with their conclusion that fundamentally the Western occupation powers of Germany agreed on the most crucial issues concerning Germany’s development before the North Atlantic Council summit in New York during September 1950. Finally, the third chapter will illuminate both the United States’ intended aim with the EDC, and the French intended aim with the EDC. Again, the main focus will be on how French aims related to Washington’s aims. Furthermore, the third chapter will illuminate the connection between the EDC, German rearmament and the Schuman Plan.","['The European Defense Community', 'Dean Acheson', 'The Pleven Plan', 'German rearmament', 'The Containment strategy', 'The Cold War', 'The Truman administration', 'The Eisenhower administration', 'NATO', 'The single package', 'The Schuman Plan', 'The ECSC', 'The Soviet Union', 'The Federal Republic of Germany', 'The North Atlantic Council', 'Jean Monnet', 'Robert Schuman']"

An Analysis of the Dutch Subtitling and Dutch Viewers’ Translation Preference of Pop-Cultural References in Audiovisual Entertainment: Gilmore Girls,"Vosselman, Merel","['Rodrigues Fonte, Catarina']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the Dutch subtitling of English-language pop-cultural references in season one, episode one, “Pilot” (2000) of the American dramedy TV series Gilmore Girls (2000-2007), and fills an academic gap that focuses on pop-cultural references whilst concentrating on English and Dutch as a language pair. This study explores how the pop-cultural references that tend to provoke a positive humour response are translated in Dutch subtitles. For textual cultural references, translators often apply explicitation. However, subtitlers are generally subject to time and spatial constraints. With this in mind, this study looks at the subtitling and purpose of pop-cultural references in Gilmore Girls, focusing on whether they appeal to the target audience or inform these viewers about the source language and culture. This study also investigates the preference of Dutch viewers with respect to extralinguistic (popular) culture-bound references in subtitles using a survey with 50 participants. The results indicate that even though the references to local institutions and toponyms were overall more focused on the source language and culture, the anthroponyms, fiction, and random references mostly underwent a subtitling approach aimed to suit the target audience. With respect to Dutch participants’ preference concerning extralinguistic (popular) culture-bound references, there is no straightforward answer, as this partly depends on their understanding of the references and their level of English. In turn, participants’ understanding depends on their age and in part on their level of education.",

Self-Respect & Rawlsian Justice. Towards an understanding of the nature of self-respect and its place in a theory of justice.,"Stegeman, Rick George Hubertus","['Meijers, Tim']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"Given that self-respect plays an incredibly important role in our lives, the aim of this thesis is to determine what place it should have in a theory of justice. In order to do so, it first examines the existing philosophical literature on this concept. It argues that this literature does not offer us a proper understanding of self-respect, treating it as an exclusively normative notion, while failing to consider its non-normative, empirical facet. By drawing on recent scientific research, it shows that there is an essentially natural component to self-respect, thereby pointing out a gap in the existing philosophical literature. Moreover, it argues that this natural component has to be taken into account, not just in order to properly understand this concept, but also to determine its place in a theory of justice. So, what is the place of self-respect in a theory of justice? Zooming in on John Rawls’ theory of justice as fairness, this thesis shows that Rawls only focussed on securing the social bases of self-respect, but failed to properly acknowledge its essentially natural component. Consequentially, Rawls failed to fully comprehend the fundamental difference between selfrespect and other social primary goods, failed to recognise the limits to treating self-respect as a distribuendum, and most seriously, failed to properly compensate citizens suffering from a natural deficiency of self-respect. This leads to the view that self-respect should be understood as a metric of justice instead of as a distribuendum. Lastly, this thesis asks how a theory of justice should treat those who are pessimistically predisposed, and as a result lack self-respect. It shows that these citizens can to at least some extent develop their self-respect. However, it also shows that in order to properly support citizens’ self-respect, one should not think and speak in terms of compensating them for some ‘disadvantage’, but in terms of affirming their equal worth and allowing them to live a worthy life. It concludes that while Dworkin’s luck egalitarian theory fails on the ideal and non-ideal level, and Anderson’s relational egalitarian theory fails on the non-ideal level, incorporating the constructive critique offered by Sen’s capabilities approach would make Rawls’ theory of justice optimally conducive to securing citizens’ self-respect.","['Self-Respect', 'Rawls', 'Distributive Justice']"
