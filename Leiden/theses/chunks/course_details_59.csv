Non-standard negation in South America: A literature research on negation in the indigenous languages of South America,"Ploeg, Berendine J","['Gijn, E. van', 'Krasnoukhova, O.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Negation has interested many a linguist, there are books and papers on this subject, ranging from world-wide cross-linguistic typologies to small highly specific in-depth case studies. However, some parts of the world are as yet under-explored on the subject of negation. This thesis aims to fill in a few of those blanks and hopes to contribute to our understanding of non-standard negation in the indigenous languages of South America. The main focus lies on non-standard negation, such as negative existentials, prohibitives and privatives, and how these relate to the standard negation as expressed in the respective languages. These types of non-standard negation have not yet been fully investigated in South American languages and this study aims to reveal particular areas in which more research should be done. The study is based on a sample of 26 languages from different language families and geographical areas within South America. The approach to the topic is of a typological nature and focuses on synchronic data. The different types of negation can be diachronically related, however. Therefore, this study serves as a foundation for follow-up research examining the diachronic processes of negation in these language families.","['negation', 'non-standard negation', 'linguistic typology', 'south america']"

"And & En, do proficient L2 speakers adapt the vowel to the target language?","Slump, Debora","['Heeren, W. F.

Research in forensic phonetics has however almost exclusively been done in monolingual contexts. This study aims to give more clarity about what features can be used in cross-linguistic speaker comparison. This is done by investigating whether proficient first language (L1) Dutch speakers of second language (L2) English adapt the vowel in and to the target language. L2 sound learning models predict that Dutch learners will have difficulty learning the difference between /ɛ/ and /æ/ and will therefore only be able to approximate nativelike pronunciation. The vowels in en and and of 35 proficient, female Dutch speakers of English were analyzed, both as a discourse marker and a coordinating conjunction. Mixed-effect models showed that for both word classes, the F1 and F2 were language-dependent. This means that the use of /æ/ as a characteristic in cross-linguistic speaker comparison is not useful.","['Forensic Linguistics', 'Discourse Markers', 'Second Language Learning']"
De scherpe blik van Bernini: Zijn Zelfportret als jongeman doorgrond in een kunsthistorische en interdisciplinaire context,"Roos, Janine","['Tummers, J.C.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Op 24-jarige leeftijd schilderde de beeldhouwer Gian Lorenzo Bernini zijn eerste zelfportret. Voor dit werk werd geen directe opdracht gegeven, noch verkocht Bernini het tijdens zijn leven. Bernini’s zelfportrettering in de schilderkunst is daarnaast relatief onderbelicht gebleven binnen het brede onderzoek dat over de eeuwen heen werd verricht naar zijn oeuvre. Ook in Bernini’s eigen tijd werd weinig gesproken over zijn kunnen als schilder. Omdat er dus geen duidelijke toedracht is en in het zelfportret zijn eigen fysionomie centraal staat, is de vraag ontstaan waarom Bernini zichzelf schilderde. Werd hij hiertoe aangezet door de kunstenaarstraditie of wedijver (aemulatio), het debat rondom de hiërarchie van de schilderkunst versus de beeldhouwkunst (paragone), wilde hij zichzelf tot alleskunner (uomo universale) ontwikkelen of ligt de verklaring elders? In dit onderzoek relateer ik Bernini’s Zelfportret als jongeman (1623) aan de primaire bronnen en enkele vergelijkbare (zelf)portretten, om zo antwoord te geven op de onderzoeksvraag.","['Schilderkunst', 'zelfportret', 'fysionomie', 'expressie', 'interdisciplinariteit.']"

Mind Your Language: A Longitudinal Study of the Catalogues of Leiden University Library’s Hebrew Manuscripts Collection,"Shalev, Nitzan","[""O'Daly, I.""]",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Catalogues have been a staple library feature for the last several centuries, a useful finding tool for readers and organizational aid for librarians; they are also a representation of a particular place and time. The form and content of a catalogue can provide insights into the social norms and scholarly interests of the era in which it was created. Employing a longitudinal and comparative approach, this thesis examines the published catalogues of Leiden University Library’s Hebrew manuscripts collection throughout its four centuries of existence. I compare these catalogues, mark the differences in the ways they describe Hebrew manuscripts, and illuminate the social changes or emerging scholarly fields that likely influenced their creators. Throughout this thesis, I argue that when it comes to Hebrew manuscripts, any examination of historical cataloguing trends or choices cannot be complete without also considering that era’s societal attitudes toward Jews, the original creators of the language and texts contained in said manuscripts. I conclude that there exists a direct correlation between the quality of the catalogues’ manuscript descriptions and the cataloguer’s knowledge of the Hebrew language and of Jewish literature and culture; I extrapolate the implications of this conclusion for the future of manuscript cataloguing in the digital age.","['Manuscript', 'Manuscript Studies', 'Catalogues', 'Archives', 'Codicology', 'Paleography', 'Translation', 'Orientalism', 'Decolonization', 'Hebrew', 'Judaism', 'Hebraism', 'Israel', 'Wissenschaft des Judentums', 'Digitization', 'Open Access', 'Digital Media', 'History of the Book', 'Book and Digital Media Studies', 'Library', 'Leiden']"
The Art of Purification: Restoration of the Female Agency in the Paintings of Matsui Fuyuko,"Vladimirova, Dariya",['Doreen Mueller'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Representative of the new and daring generation, Matsui Fuyuko experiments with traditional Japanese art and infuses it with grotesque motifs that respond to contemporary interests and anxieties. She discusses the delicate topics of female suffering and self-expression, which broaches unavoidably the salience of religious influence on the historical formation of gender roles in the Japanese society. In this thesis, I will analyze this subject through the dichotomy of purity versus impurity, as it is instrumental in organizing space in the lives of ordinary Japanese. In varied contexts, purity is used to contrast the sacred and the abominable, the clean and the polluted, or the male and the female body. By placing the paintings of Matsui Fuyuko in the syncretic religious context unique to Japan, it is possible to establish a connection between Buddhist meditation practices and Shinto rituals. In this sense, the aesthetic collation of the pure feminine and the shock-inducing realism of the rotting female corpse in Matsui's paintings can be seen as a form of social protest against pernicious gender biases. She challenges the traditional expectations towards women to display humility, self-restraint and to embrace their role as mothers and caretakers by instead painting them in defiant and provocative poses. The main question to be tackled in this research is how the painter modifies the concept of purity to communicate her feelings and ideas to the viewer through artistic means. I will disclose why the art of Matsui Fuyuko can be seen as an emotional purification of the artist, a meditative tool for the audience, as well as how it defies traditional views on the female body.","['Matsui Fuyuko', 'Japanese Culture', 'Feminism', 'Buddhist Art', 'Shinto']"

Playing with Alterity: Overcoming Boundaries of Difference using the Imaginative Empathy of Play,"Groot, Charlotte de","['Sleutels, Jan']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This thesis argues that fiction and eventually play, accumulating into the interactive fiction of video games, can offer a toolset to help cultivate familiarity and understanding between cultures. In a world where cultures are living closer together than before, tensions between cultures are sure to rise. These tensions stem from a lack of shared context causing misinterpretations of the other. I will refer to the works of Wilhelm Dilthey and Robin Collingwood, who have both developed theories of hermeneutics that emphasise the importance of context as meaning-giving. Similar contexts provide similar meaning between people and vice versa. A lack in familiarity thus constitutes a lack in understanding, which poses a problem for the cross-cultural encounter. They suggest a hermeneutic method based on empathy in order to increase our understanding of others. In the second chapter, I will illustrate how fiction functions as both a tool to impart knowledge and as an exercise in empathy, which aids the hermeneutic process, drawing on Suzanne Keen’s theory of narrative empathy. When engaging with fiction, audiences temporarily abandon their own context in order to step into the alternate world of fiction. This encourages open-mindedness and empathic understanding of others, which both are of vital importance to the hermeneutic process. In the third chapter, I’ll move on play, showing how it, like fiction, demands a certain openness of mind from the player so they can step into the play-world, which makes play very well-suited to learning by doing. This section on play will be largely informed by Johan Huizinga and Miguel Sicart’s work on play and playfulness respectively. In requiring participation from its audience, they are absorbed into the other, the strange, and the new, and provided with tools to make sense of it. As an immersive and interactive medium, video games thus allow players to gain an intuitive understanding of other cultures on their own terms.","['Play', 'alterity', 'hermeneutics', 'fiction', 'philosophy', 'otherness', 'multicultural', 'cross-cultural', 'imagination', 'empathy']"
Who benefits from ‘our’ debt? The Holder Structure of German Government Debt and Distribution of its Beneficiaries,"Schulz, Jannik","['London, J.D.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis is an exploratory case study of the distribution of economic benefits resulting from the ownership structure of German government debt. Sectoral ownership of German government debt is examined for domestic, euro area (EA), and non-EA investors from 2015 – 2020. While the Bundesbank and European Central Bank sharply increased their holdings of government debt, bank ownership decreased but remained dominant domestically. Foreign ownership is driven by insurance companies and pension funds (ICPF) and investment funds. Direct household holdings are insignificant. For Q4 2020, the holder-specific analysis shows higher German government debt ownership concentrations within the banking and ICPF sectors than for investment funds. The distribution of indirect benefits of this ownership structure via the customer and shareholder channels are mapped across German household wealth and income strata. Ownership of bank deposits and securities accounts, ICPF policies, and investment fund shares are considered for the customer channel. No unidirectional distributive effect is found across this group of beneficiaries. Public banks’ holdings create a level of self-indebtedness, which lowers the distributive consequences. As household ownership of corporate shares is top heavy, the shareholder channel has a regressive distributive effect. Financial intermediaries play a dual role as direct owners and indirect beneficiaries as shareholders. This thesis finds an unequal distribution of benefits, which indicates a regressive distributive effect of the German government debt ownership structure. These results are discussed in the context of political and economic power relations between the government and its creditors.","['Public Debt, Inequality, Ownership, Government Debt']"
The Word Is the Flower: Reflections on the Mapudungun Translator as Political Activist,"Gallardo Torres, Selena","['Reus, T.', 'Alves Vieira, E.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis ventures into the particular climate of Mapudungun translators in Chile and scrutinizes the possibility of translation as an instrument of Mapuche activism. It investigates notions of political agency, habitus, hybridity, and fluency to establish whether these suit the postcolonial condition of Indigenous Latin America. The study’s theoretical framework builds upon translation theories that consider the ties between transformative practices and political or activist engagement. The literature review explores the transformative elements of translation to deduce how activist translation can be defined. It additionally dissects Bourdieu’s conceptualization of habitus and agency to comprehend and analyze transformative translation practices in the postcolonial condition. This debate on postcolonial and translatorial paradigms is complemented by a consideration of the overarching crucial role of translation in Mapuche literature and the significant link between Indigenous identity and language. This thesis expands upon Bhabha’s hybridity and Venuti’s fluency to examine the viability of Rivera Cusicanqui’s ch’ixi as a framework to study Mapudungun translation. The study relies on semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis to determine the political means of Mapudungun translations. The results provide insight into the different forms of sociopolitical translation undertaken by Mapudungun translators and what can be considered the task of the Mapudungun translator. Most importantly, this work provides incentive for further research into translation practices in Indigenous Latin America and demonstrates why this cultural region should not remain overlooked.","['Political agency, Mapudungun, translating and interpreting, Mapuche literature, postcolonial theory, Ch’ixi']"

The Contemporary Stage of the Okinawa Base Issue: Critical Discourse Analysis of Japanese Newspapers’ Representation During the Second Abe Administration 2012-2016,"Mahir, M","['Black, L.O.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since 2012 the Japanese security environment witnessed rapid changes which in turn impacted its security policy. These changes in the security policy and environment impacted Okinawa directly. Conservative newspapers emphasise the government's narrative about the importance of the presence of the US bases on Okinawa for deterrence. Liberal newspapers call for relocating the Futenma base outside Okinawa to reduce the burden on the island. Accordingly, this thesis investigates how the representation of the Okinawa base issue in Japan’s left and right-leaning newspapers has developed during the changes in the Japanese security environment and policy. This research uses critical discourse analysis to investigate the discourse on Okinawa in Japanese newspapers by analysing the depiction of the Okinawan response toward the Futenma base relocation. Then, it examines newspapers’ representations of the Okinawa issue in the context of the regional security threats. The results identify the differences and similarities between left- and right-leaning newspapers’ representation of the Okinawa issue. Despite the various representations of the Okinawa issue in right and left-leaning newspapers, the dominant security narrative shapes the discourse on the Okinawa issue. This study finds that left-leaning newspapers played a role in strengthening the conservative representation of the Okinawa issue. Hereby, the thesis may serve as a foundation for a broader study of representation discourse in newspapers.","['Okinawa, military bases, CDA, Yomiuri, Mainichi, Sankei, Japan Times, Nikkei, Asahi, Futenma relocation, Henoko']"
South Korean Public Diplomacy: A Case Study of China and THAAD,"Cramer, Mischa","['Jang, S.Y.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Koreastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"South Korea-China bilateral relations deteriorated in the wake of the THAAD announcement in July of 2016. China considers the anti-ballistic missile defense system currently situated on South Korean soil a gross violation of their national security. Subsequently, Chinese public opinion of South Korea regressed swiftly due to negative representation of South Korea’s security policies throughout Chinese state media. In response, South Korea employed public and traditional diplomatic approaches to restore bilateral favorability. Through a mixed method exploratory study, which considers quantitative and qualitative data, the effectiveness of public diplomacy in the given context was clearly deduced . This approach is seldom employed in the field of diplomacy research and thus resulted in a more innovative understanding. The findings demonstrate the insignificant impact that public diplomacy had on Chinese public opinion subsequent to the THAAD incident. Influential Chinese state media, effective traditional diplomatic alternatives, and insufficient coordination represent the key roadblocks for public diplomacy’s efficiency in targeting the Chinese population. Anticipating these variables can facilitate further development of public diplomacy strategies by South Korean policy makers.","['South Korea', 'China', 'Public Diplomacy', 'Terminal High Altitude Area Defense']"

A Very Corrupt Dialect of the Tongue: Anglicisation and Scotticisms in nineteenth-century Scottish pauper petitions,"Groot, Hester","['Gordon, M.S.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The development of late modern Scottish English (1700-1900) is characterized by heavy amounts of prescriptivism. This specifically took the form of a process of anglicisation which pushed the previously high-status Scots language variety into the margins. Scottish linguistic features were proscribed in favour of London-English variants, and numerous studies have attested how the writings of upper- and middle-class Scottish authors took over the higher-prestige anglicised variants at the expense of traditional Scottish forms. How these language ideologies affected the usage of lower-class Scots, though, has long remained underinvestigated, in large part due to an absence of available data. The recent publication of a corpus of lower-class Scottish writing from the nineteenth century—the Corpus of Scottish Pauper Petitions, or ScotPP corpus, which includes pauper petitions written in a variety of Scottish parishes throughout the nineteenth century—offers new possibilities for research into lower-class linguistic developments. Making use of this corpus, the present thesis investigates the occurrence of anglicisation in lower-class written language. I compare the extent to which prescriptivism has affected the ScotPP pauper petitions with the writings of upper- and middle-class Scottish people during this period, drawing on materials the Corpus of Modern Scottish Writing (CMSW). By studying both overt and covert Scotticisms, drawing respectively on works by contemporaneous prescriptivists and works by modern linguists, an approach is taken that highlights not only the process of language change from above through standardisation, but also the from below aspect of developments and how they interact and co-occur with the prescriptivism of the era. In doing so, this thesis sheds light on the sociohistorical processes by which anglicisation spread through and affected the language of the nineteenth-century Scottish social classes.","['historical sociolinguistics', 'Scots', 'prescriptivism', 'anglicisation', 'language from below', 'pauper petitions']"

During the so-called “Second Sophistic”, the renewed interest of the literate Greek elite for the accomplishments of the classical past led to a renegotiation of the relationship with Rome. The present paper examines the role of Rome in the Panathenaicus of Aelius Aristides. Basing my analysis on the rhetorical device of “figured speech”, I examine the rhetorical function of Rome inside the speech, its relationship with Athens, as well as the emerging stance of Aristides towards Roman rulership. I support that Aristides downsizes the status of Rome to extoll the greatness of Athens, while at the same time giving voice to his general hesitation towards the empire by highlighting the Greek cultural preeminence over the Romans. In this way, I hope to cover the relevant research gap, since scholarship on the relationship of Aristides with Rome is predominantly based on the homonymous oration, while the Panathenaicus has been mostly analyzed on the base of Athenian religious preeminence over the emperor.","['Second Sophistic', 'Epideictic Rhetoric', 'cultural identities', 'Aelius Aristides', 'encomium', 'Rome', 'Athens']"

Yet, one Mozambican artist, Frank Ntaluma’s house, called Mozambican House among Afro-Mozambicans in Lisbon, seems to overturn this perception. It exists as a hangout among them and even provides them with informal security nets. This thesis aims to explore how their conviviality appears at this Mozambican House in Lisbon, Portugal. Observing life in Mozambican House enabled us to see how various “intermediaries” work together as a catalyst of creating a condition for them to live with others, namely, their daily reciprocal interactions via mobile phones, shared expectation to answer positively to requests from others for favours, and dissimulative acts. These “intermediaries” are backed by the shared sense and mode of Estamos Juntos [we are together], which they also narrate as “ethics”. Mozambican House is realised as a sum of the shared “intermediaries”, intertwining with Ntaluma’s personality who holds a passion for having an extensive network. This research applied auto-ethnography, participant observation and in-depth interviewing with 19 participants as research methods. Participant observation was conducted between November 2021 and February 2022 in Ntaluma’s house.","['Conviviality, Auto-ethnography, Migrants, Afro-mozambican, Lisbon']"

Al sinds het begin van de revolutie zendt het Cubaanse regime medici naar o.a. Chili, Nicaraqua, Guatemala, maar ook naar landen op het Afrikaanse continent; Algerije, Mozambique en Angola. Vanaf de jaren 90 werden steeds meer Cubaans medische missies gezonden naar westerse, kapitalistische staten. Castro zag de Cubaanse medici als zijn ‘leger van witte jassen’. Het Cubaans medisch internationalisme wordt beschouwd als medische diplomatie. De medische missies fungeren als soft power instrumenten. Op basis van de medische missies verkrijgt Cuba symbolisch kapitaal in de vorm van goodwill, prestige, aanzien en invloed. Het symbolisch kapitaal kan dienen als fundament voor het aantrekken van fysiek kapitaal. De Mais Médicos en Oil-For-Doctors programma’s tonen op welke wijze Cuba zijn internationale economische belangen veilig stelt. Ook verwerft Cuba met behulp van de medische diplomatie steun en zodoende invloed in internationale fora.

The U.S. Navy has a unique and rich strategic culture that is rooted in history and shared experiences. As a result, Navy strategic culture can be used to interpret defense policy decisions in order to understand them from a new perspective. This thesis uses historical contextualism and Colin Gray’s understanding of strategic culture to analyze how the Navy interpreted the demands of the National Security Strategy of 1991 and repackaged them into the strategic document ...From the Sea. Two key findings can be established from a Navy strategic culture interpretation of the National Security Strategy. Firstly, U.S. Navy strategic culture interpreted the National Security Strategy’s focus on regional threats as a change in the maritime domain. This signaled the Navy to shift its focus from open ocean warfighting to littoral operations. Secondly, U.S. Navy strategic culture responded to the demand for a forward presence in regions by expanding its commitment to being an expeditionary force.","['Strategic Culture', 'Defense Policy', 'Navy', 'U.S.A.']"

Familiar Strangers: The enhancement of the Dutch-Indonesian postcolonial bilateral relationship during the 1960’s,"Eilert, Sophie",['Dr. A.A. Yenen'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis describes the radical changes in the Dutch-Indonesian postcolonial relationship from animosity towards friendliness during the 1960's. The general consensus is that this was enforced by the coup d'etat of 1965 and the subsequent presidency of general Suharto. However with primary sources I substantiated that the rapprochement between the countries had already started before. Moreover by using newspaper articles and governmental correspondence I provided insight in the way in which this enhanced relationship was understood by the Dutch government and Dutch public. I researched how this relationship could enhance against a background of a painful colonial past and the violence used by Suharto's regime against Indonesians suspected of communist sympathies. The conclusion of the research was that the both the Dutch government and public understood the enhanced relationship as a positive development, an economic opportunity and a chance to restore their damaged image in Indonesia, as they felt cultural nearness to the people of their former colony. The atrocities commited by Suharto's regime were dissapproved of but considered a domestic matter of Indonesia. Therefore the Dutch government and public have not observed the violation of human rights in Indonesia as an obstacle in enhancing the economic and cultural relation with Indonesia.","[""Postcolonial relationship, The Netherlands, Indonesia, Suharto, Coup d'etat, 1960's""]"

The adaptability of the sonnet becomes evident in various ways. This degree of innovation allowed for the sonnet to develop from its origin as a love poem towards the religious sonnet, extending the topic of secular love, central to the Petrarchan sonnet, to include divine love and human-divine relationality. Following from that, the religious sonnet developed into the political sonnet. The political sonnet provided the foundation for women to set the stage with their contributions to the sonnet: women used the sonnet as a vehicle for private and political expression and thereby constructed the identity of the woman poet. Moreover, the adaptability of the sonnet becomes clear in the way in which individual poets innovate the sonnet in various ways. This thesis showcases examples in which poets reinvent the sonnet by means of innovative use of structural and formal conventions. Innovation of form and structure within the sonnet is analysed and contextualised by comparing sonnets by poets from the period between 1600 and 1800. The central question is how these poets innovate the use of the sonnet to respond to the events of their time, and how the successive innovation of the sonnet has caused the form to open up to address a wider range of topics.","['Sonnet', 'Early Modern English Poetry', 'John Donne', 'John Milton', 'George Herbert', 'Mary Robinson', 'Charlotte Smith', 'Sonnet Form', 'Female Sonnet', 'Political Sonnet']"

The Repositioning of North Korean Soft Power,"Swildens, Renske","['Green, C.K.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Social media and videoblogging, or vlogging, are taking over the internet and North Korea is joining this trend. While doing so, the state is reaching out to the international community through relatable media content and soft power tools. One of the examples, in which North Korea reached out to the international viewer, is the Youtube channel ‘Echo of Truth’. This research aims to answer the question as to how soft power tools are applied in the videos of ‘Echo of Truth’. By using a qualitative visual discourse analysis, it analyzes the videos of ‘Echo of Truth’ to answer this question. This thesis argues that soft power tools, such as cultural and culinary diplomacy, are applied in the videos in order to make these videos more relatable to the international audience. However, not all the videos were found to have used these soft power techniques as traditional propaganda videos were still uploaded to the channel. The sheer differences found in the channel’s videos raised the question of a power dilemma the channel seemed to be facing.","['North Korea', 'Soft Power', 'Social Media', 'Youtube', 'The DPRK', 'North Korean Soft Power', 'Power Strategies']"

Made in China: Hoe internetmemes de verantwoordelijkheid voor de COVID-19 pandemie over de westerse grenzen schuiven,"Maas, Paul","['Van Hout, T.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Internetmemes zijn door het enorme bereik en de actieve participatiecultuur eromheen niet meer weg te denken als online communicatiemiddel. Daarbij zijn memes regelmatig rijk aan culturele, sociale, politieke en maatschappelijke boodschappen die snel onderdeel worden van het publieke leven. Deze boodschappen zijn overigens niet altijd constructief van aard en bestaan geregeld uit stereotyperende en racistische uitingen tegenover minderheden. Daarmee lijken memes hand in hand te gaan met het concept van othering, waarbij minderheden middels culturele stereotyperingen negatief worden weggezet. Dit fenomeen leeft vooral op tijdens crisismomenten, zo ook tijdens de COVID-19 pandemie. Vooral de Chinese gemeenschap krijgt te maken met culturele stereotyperingen met als doel: de schuld afschuiven op de gemeenschap. De stereotyperende tendens van internetmemes lijkt hand in hand te gaan met het concept van othering, maar die relatie blijft op wetenschappelijk gebied onder de radar. In dit onderzoek is deze relatie middels een kritische discoursanalyse onderzocht. Uit een analyse van een corpus internetmemes over de pandemie blijkt dat er drie categorieën van memes te onderscheiden zijn die het othering-discourse richting de Chinese gemeenschap reflecteren en daarnaast eigentijdse uitingen aan dit discours bijdragen. Daarnaast is er een vierde categorie van memes die niet zozeer aan het othering-discours bijdraagt, maar wel aan sociale stereotyperingen over de Chinese gemeenschap. Met het inzicht dat verkregen is in dit onderzoek groeit ook het bewustzijn van de mogelijke impact van memes. Gezien stereotyperende en racistische uitingen in memes nog altijd springlevend lijken, maar vaak verschuild gaan onder de vlag van humor, dienen zowel de makers als ontvangers van memes waakzaam te zijn voor deze subtiele en onsubtiele uitingen.","['Internetmemes, Othering, Stereotypering, Cultuur, COVID-19, Pandemie']"

Male violence against women centres around women protecting themselves rather than the addressing the issue of male violence. This study focuses on how machismo culture allows for and tolerates male violence to continue within Bogota, Colombia and what the mayor is doing to address it. Machismo is the cultural phenomenon ascribed to Latin America; it is machismo culture that instils traits that allow for violence to be tolerated. In order to tackle machismo culture hegemonic masculinity was explored alongside gender roles, violence and shame. The mayor of Bogota, Claudia López Hernández, has taken steps to promote the unlearning of machismo through her anti-machismo hotline. This hotline was advertised through the use of a miniseries, both broadcasted on television and actively publicised on social media. The miniseries has been analysed, through a thematic reading, to understand how the bonds of hegemonic masculinity can be broken and how negative machismo behaviour can be challenged. These components of the campaign are in place to help solve the issue of male violence against women. The results from this research suggest that the campaign has been successful in changing machismo attitudes. However, research needs to be undertaken to ascertain if the rate of violence against women has decreased.",
The impact of the On-Screen Image on the Off-Screen Reality: the influence of travestí and trans representation in the media on public sentiment in Brazil,"Barkmeijer, Kevin","['Alves Vieira, E.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis aims at examining the influence of social media representation of trans and travestí people on the public sentiment towards this group. It discusses how, historically, trans and travestí issues have been underrepresented in queer theories and linguistics. It intends to address the gap when it comes to trans and travestí research in Brazil and instigate further research on this topic. The results of the survey found that a majority of participants base their perception and opinion on trans and travestí people from representation in the Brazilian media. Researching trans and travestí in the media in Brazil revealed particular attitudes and stigmas that influence the media consumers' perception of this group. Research has indicated that social representations are carriers of stigmas and sentiments that are transmitted through the media and become culturally embedded and could negatively affect the group represented (Jodelet 2001). Therefore, it is important to understand what sentiments and stigmas the media portrayals in Brazil contain to understand the specificity of Brazil’s public sentiment concerning gender-based violence. The research has found that the media often reduces their depiction of trans and travestí people as victims of violence and discrimination. This type of portrayal of trans people as victims has been connected to the reproduction of the culture of violence against trans people internationally (De Jong et al., 2021). In Brazil, the prominence of transfeminicides can be understood to a greater extent by recognizing the contribution of the Brazilian media in the reproduction of a culturally embedded violent sentiment towards trans and travestí people. For this reason, this thesis urges toward a multi-dimensional, humanized, and accurate portrayal of trans and travestí people in the Brazilian media.","['Transgender, travestí, Brazil, representation, social sentiment, transphobia, transfeminicides,']"

Mahram Regulations and The Hajj: A comparative study between Dutch and Saudi Arabian female pilgrims,"Abarbri, Layla","['Mirahmadi, S.', 'Kaptein, N.J.G']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The aim of this study is to research how the mahram regulations hinder Dutch women in a different manner than Saudi Arabian women when performing their Hajj. This will be achieved by focusing on the state regulations and religious regulations for Muslims in the Netherlands and in Saudi Arabia. To test the hypothesis that there are not many differences between the hindrances of Dutch and Saudi Arabian women regarding Hajj, I have conducted a literature review along with additional interviews. In total, there are six interviewees who have shared their experience on the pilgrimage. From the results it can be seen that there are not many differences between the hindrances of Dutch and Saudi Arabian female pilgrims when it comes to the mahram regulations. The first difference is the limitations set by the Saudi state and the Dutch state. However, the Saudi regulations eventually applied to both groups and therefore did not create much difference. The main difference is the control on the presence of a male guardian. While the Dutch female pilgrims get checked on a mahram when applying for a visa, the Saudi pilgrims could avoid this and therefore it is made easier for them to perform the pilgrimage without a male guardian.","['Hajj', 'Mahram', 'Dutch women', 'Saudi women']"

Soberanía alimentaria as a component of buen vivir in Ecuador and Bolivia: paradigm shift or failure of a 'progressive' policy framework?,"Bruno, Claudia",['Dr. Rebeca Fernández Rodríguez'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Food sovereignty has been incorporated into various constitutional frameworks worldwide as it is believed to be a key element for the achievement of sustainable economic development. In particular, countries in Latin America like Bolivia and Ecuador have adopted food sovereignty and integrated it into a broader cosmovision of good living according to indigenous concepts like Buen Vivir. However, there is growing confusion around what the concept of food sovereignty does and does not entail, leading many governments to adopt the interpretation to achieve ideals of growth and accumulation. This has contributed to food sovereignty being adopted solely as an ideological base for national policies and not as a practical tool for a paradigm shift to occur. Many factors contributed to the failure of the fostering of food sovereignty by the state. This paper critically analyses which are the main factor that led to the failure of the institutionalization of food sovereignty as a right to Buen Vivir within the constitutions of Bolivia and Ecuador. Arguably the continuation of neoliberal policies and the weakness of the policy framework. A mixed-methods of data analysis and case study analysis were employed to investigate this.",['Post-extractive development-Buen Vivir-Ecuador-food sovereignty-Bolivia']

‘To the Nations of the World ! Greeting.’: On the reception of the Irish claim for independence and the French and British press,"Gerritsen, Wouter",['Joost Augusteijn'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"On 21 January 1919 Sinn Féin sent out a message to the free nations of the world. The message showed that Irish Republicans realised that they were not fighting their battle in a political vacuum. Meanwhile, the Paris Peace Conference had just started and the United States, Great Britain, France, and to a lesser extent Italy, were busy in the French capital redrawing the map of Europe and the world. Therefore, Sinn Féin selected Sean T. O’Kelly to go to Paris, to obtain a hearing for the Irish before the Conference, and to promote the Irish claim for independence. While the Irish claim in Paris has been amply studied, the same cannot be said for its reception. This thesis, therefore, analyses how the Irish claim for independence during the Paris Peace Conference was received by the British and French press. For France, the newspapers Le Temps, La Croix, Le Petit Parisien, La Presse, and L’Humanité are considered, while for Britain the Manchester Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, the Daily news, and the Daily Herald are studied. The analysis incorporates to what extent these newspapers were influenced by the Irish Wilsonian moment. The Wilsonian Moment, as defined by historian Erez Manela, was a moment between the final stages of the war and beginning of the Paris Peace Conference, during which US President Woodrow Wilson's wartime principles seemed destined to shape the coming new world order. The main principle was that of the right of nations to self-determination. Nationalists from multiple countries, those of Ireland among them, capitalised on these principles, trying to obtain self-determination for their nation in Paris. This created the Wilsonian moment. However, the Irish, like the Egyptians, Indians and Koreans, were confronted in the French capital with the Realpolitik of the victor nations. Like many other nationalists, the Irish resorted to violence when they found out that Wilson’s “imperative principles of action” did not seem to apply to them. In short, rhetoric met reality, and disillusionment and violence ensued. 2 In general, the reaction to of the majority of the French press to the Irish claims in Paris was indifferent. Le Temps, Le Petit Parisien and La Presse all sticked to short, factual reporting from an English perspective. Being a catholic newspaper La Croix was more friendly towards Ireland, publishing more in-depth articles. It favoured Dominion Home Rule, but never pleaded for the Irish to get a hearing. Lastly, L’Humanité was the only paper to fully support Irish independence. Although it was no fan of Sinn Féin, it agreed with the Wilsonian principles as presented by the Republicans. L'Humanité was the only French paper to use Irish Wilsonian rhetoric, but since these principles were already strongly grounded in socialism it is difficult to conclude the influence that the Irish Wilsonian moment had on the paper. What can be concluded is that the Irish Wilsonian moment did not significantly alter any pre-held notions of the different sections of the French press on Ireland, nor did it manage to break the Anglo-French war-time alliance. The reaction of the English press to the Irish claims varied greatly. It ran from extremely negative by the Daily Telegraph to immensely positive by the Daily Herald, with the Manchester Guardian and Daily Mail in between as respectively rather positive and rather negative. The Daily Telegraph was strongly opposed to the Irish getting a hearing or any form of self-government in the near future. It viewed the Irish question from a territorial integrity perspective and put the security of Britain high above principles like self-determination. The Daily Mail mostly focussed on the British government and their handling of the situation. It was more anti-government policy than it was pro-Irish. It neither opposed, nor pleaded for the Irish getting a hearing, supported moderate nationalism and pleaded for Dominion Home Rule. The Manchester Guardian reacted positively and expressed the wish that Ireland should be granted a hearing before the Conference. It was increasingly critical of the government. In practice the paper pleaded for Dominion Home Rule. The Daily Herald was the only paper to openly argue for self-determination for Ireland, and seems to have been 3 influenced by the Irish Wilsonian moment. While it had already adhered to principles similar to those of the Wilsonian moment, the amount of exact overlap is fascinating. It truly believed Wilson’s and England’s war-time principles should have shaped a new world order. The Manchester Guardian was the other paper that seems to have been influenced by the Irish Wilsonian moment, albeit to a significantly lesser extent. Interestingly, the Guardian’s interpretation of self-determination laid bare the crucial difference between what historian Bill Kissane has called the internal and external interpretations of the term. It followed the internal interpretation, meaning the right for people to choose their own form of government, but not the sovereignty under which they live. This shows that while the vagueness of the term self-determination led to its mass appeal, it also meant that different interpretations led to clashing expectations. In a broader sense this does align with Kissane’s idea that the use of nationalist ideas is shaped by the geo-political context. In other words: the same nationalist principle could be interpreted completely different, depending on the geo-political context. In turn, this shows how the Wilsonian moment must not be seen as one coherent entity but rather as a myriad of interpretations of the same ideal-type doctrine. In England the Irish Wilsonian moment did also not significantly alter any pre-conceived notions about Ireland and its right to independence. Instead the influence of the Irish Wilsonian moment on the British press must be seen as an extra layer added to old beliefs. In general, it has to be concluded that the majority of newspaper readers in France and England were not significantly influenced by the Wilsonian moment in Ireland.",

The Real Reason For The Replication Crisis,"Heppner, Jonathan","['Li, J. J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"Since the 2010's Psychology is in a replication crisis. There is an active debate within the discipline to ""solve"" the crisis. I argue that so far, most of the debate has been ignorant about the real problem causing the crisis. Roughly the crisis literature be grouped into a replication, a normativity and a validity crisis (Lundh, 2019). Most authors focus on the first to issues. While in reality the current crisis is a validity crisis, the method’s of psychology pass by the nature of its problem (chapter 1). I show through the work of Edmund Husserl how the problem arises as a consequence of the Galilean method of natural science (chapter 2). Then, I show how in psychology’s history the naturalism, which arose with the scientific revolution, kept it stuck in a perpetual crisis causing a perpetual cycle of revolutions (Introspectionism, Behaviorism, Cognitivism, Enactvisim) (chapter 3). Lastly, I sketch out Husserl’s proposed solution to break the cycle and arrive at scientific psychology on new terms which capture the essence of the mind as essentially subjective (chapter 4).","['Psychology, Replication Crisis, Phenomenology, Phenomenological Psychology, Husserl']"

In this thesis two hypotheses were tested: differences in the positioning of the ‘cultural dominant term’, and the related hypothesis where the combination of words, and their positioning, are dictated by culture. As the research showed, there are strong tendencies towards orderings in which the culturally dominant term always stands in the same position. This means that the two slots within a lexical parallel are grammatical slots, where the one slot has more power than the other, and thus occupies the word which has most power in the culture. The other hypothesis showed that languages differ in the position in which the culturally most dominant term is placed. For Leti and Rotinese, this is the first position, therefore, those languages are called P1-Languages. However, Kambera and Fataluku place the culturally most important term in the second position and are therefore called P2-Languages.","['linguistics', 'ritual speech', 'oral tradition', 'parallelism', 'lexical parallelism']"

Rohingya’s Poetic Resistance: Humanizing Statelessness through Political Poetic Reflections of Rohingya Artists,"Post, Rona",['Dr. I. Hadiprayinto'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Following a military crackdown in Myanmar’s state of Rakhine in 2017, increased reports of violence and displacement of Rohingya surfaced. At the centre of these circumstances is the Rohingya ‘statelessness’, resulting from the Rohingya’s denied membership to the political community of Myanmar. Legal Studies understands statelessness as a ‘legal anomaly’ relating to non-existence of a legal bond between a state and an individual. Although this understanding dominates discourse on statelessness, including that of the Rohingya, a shift away from this conceptualisation is evident in academic circles outside Legal Studies. Scholars in Humanities, Social Sciences and Political Philosophy warn it dehumanizes how statelessness is also an experienced state of being. Stressing need for alternative approaches, suggestions have been made about focusing on artistic accounts of statelessness. These have been embraced by organisations like Oxfam, who initiated a ‘Rohingya Realities; Rohingya Futures’ art competition campaign. During this campaign, Rohingya artists submitted artworks wherein they reflect on their realities, hopes and dreams. This thesis analyses how four poetic accounts of stateless Rohingya poets, in Oxfam’s art competition campaign, may humanize dominant discourse on the Rohingya’s statelessness. It is argued the poetic accounts humanize dominant discourse by, firstly, providing a means of seeing statelessness in terms of a human condition that is lived, felt, and experienced; secondly, drawing attention to the poets’ demonstration of agency through their experiential accounts of statelessness; and finally, the poems’ ability to create empathy and invite readers to think critically about the conceptual understanding of statelessness as well as the stateless reality the Rohingya face. Given this thesis intends to enquire into theoretical understandings of statelessness politically-philosophically and culturally, whilst analysing the so-far understudied contribution artistic accounts have to statelessness discourse, this thesis adds to interdisciplinary statelessness research.","['Rohingya', 'Statelessness', 'Poetic Resistance', 'Humanization', 'Artistic Value', 'Legal Studies', 'Political Philosophy', 'Humanities', 'Discourse']"

Translating Taboo Language in Southern Gothic Literature: A Case Study of The Heart is A Lonely Hunter and To Kill a Mockingbird,"Broersen, Laura",['Dr K.L. Zeven'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis provides an analysis of the translation of racial taboo language in Southern Gothic novels in the form of a descriptive case study. For this study, two well-known examples of Southern Gothic fiction were selected: Carson McCullers’ The Heart is a Lonely Hunter (1941) and Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird (1960). A crucial characteristic of Southern Gothic as a genre that differs from general American Gothic is the fact that it specifically explores the unpleasant realities of life in the American South, including racial injustices and prejudices. As a result, a prominent element in novels of this genre is that they include topics that could be considered problematic and even taboo in their writing, such as racial stereotyping and slurs targeting minority groups. The translation of such language is particularly problematic for translators, as the acceptance of taboo language and the way taboo words are used not only differs per cultural context but also changes over time. The analysis used an approach based on Descriptive Translation Studies (DTS) as it will focus on the effect the use of taboo language in the target text (TT) might have within the target culture (TC). The analysis considered whether certain ethical considerations might have influenced the translation procurers the translators have employed and also how the source culture (SC) differs from the TC. This study found that the approach of translations from the 1960s and the 2010s was not significantly different for most instances of taboo language, while the ideology within both the SC and TC and the degree of acceptability for certain words has changed.","['Descriptive Translation Studies, Taboo Language, Southern Gothic, Racist Language, Re-translation, Carson McCullers, Harper Lee']"
Vowels and mergers in East Lancashire: the case of north/force and face/goat in the South Asian community,"Mahamdi, Malika","['Smakman, D.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores vowel mergers in the South Asian community of East Lancashire and the social factors affecting these realisations. Possible (non-)mergers north/force and face/goat are examined for a total of seven speakers by means of a word list reading, and sociolinguistic interviews with all speakers provided data on social factors such as socioeconomic background, social mobility, and identity. Like Standard British English, there is a merge of the lexical sets north and force, following what has been described as the first force merger. However, face and goat present a non-merger that behaves differently compared to the known northern English standard. Unlike a northern, monophthongised realisation of both vowels, all speakers gravitate towards a more southern, diphthongised realisation of face. Goat, however, remains a monophthong for all within this small dataset. The deviation found in the face lexical set might be explained through the social factor of social mobility, as all speakers express a desire to rise above the lower to working-class environment they have grown up in. At the same time, if the maintenance of monophthongised goat is an indication of loyalty to their identity, an argument can be made for the lacking desire of the younger second-generation British South Asians to give up their distinguishing dialectal features.","['Linguistics', 'Phonetics', 'Sociolinguistics', 'Mergers', 'Lancashire', 'Blackburn', 'Preston', 'Social factors', 'Vowel normalisation', 'British Asian English']"
A Scroll on a Sunday Afternoon: Minor Landscape Photography in Times of Environmental Concern,"Bousema, Anniëtte","['Shobeiri, S.A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The monumental and breathtaking grand vistas seen in technologically advanced sublime landscape photography aiming to objectively warn about the fragile state of the earth, raise the question of whether landscape photography could offer a less heroic, yet ethically engaging counter language that facilitates a responsive involvement with our environment. The research introduces the concept of a non-representative “minor landscape photography” as a change-seeking approach to camera technology that regains the ideological erasure of subjective technological vision. In that sense, minor landscape photography rejects the humanist ideology of objective vision that conceptually excludes the observer from the field of vision. Assisted by an elaborate case study with photographers that are critically involved with landscape representation the research investigates three counter perspectives to “unsee” the authoritative, all-seeing eye of disembodied vision. In a performative process of embodied unseeing, the perspectives operate on reduced visibility with photographs that consciously act as mediating surfaces between the observer and the world. Ultimately, in favour of a non-oppositional, multi-perspectival and transformative liaison with contemporary technology and its subject matter, the research emphasises the ethical promise of minor landscape photography to inform a “world that is yet to be.” In times of environmental concern, the ultimate rejection of technology’s repressive magic and its static “view from nowhere” invite camera technology to assist in the formation of a liberating, life-informing and eco-conscious landscape photography that empowers accountable “views from somewhere” to evolve.","['landscape photography', 'objective technological vision', 'subjective viewing modes', 'reduced visibility', ""observer's involvement"", 'environmental concern', 'ethical promise.']"

Interrogating the epistemic foundations of the Eurocentric colonial metaphysical categories of the human and animal, the study combines techniques from historical discourse analysis with theory from Zakiyyah Iman Jackson’s Becoming Human: Matter and Meaning in an Antiblack World, a work that challenges the human/animal binary by reframing the black(ened) human as an entangled and integral component of modern (human) being. As examples illustrative of Dutch racism past and present, Nepveu’s representations of whiteness, blackness and animality – types of being demonstrated to be constitutive of the Enlightenment liberal universal concept of humanity – are situated in the larger context of (European-led) transatlantic slavery, conquest and colonialism. Arguing against the dominant scholarly trend that frames antiblack ideology in terms of acceptance/exclusion from the category of the human and the legal, political and social rights it entails, the category of the universal liberal human itself and the historical context from which it emerged is shown to have established and sustained race and the intertwined abjectification of the non-human.","['Slavery, colonialism, Suriname, racism, animal, 18th century']"

Een kritische discoursanalyse naar populisme en mediakritiek: Hoe politici van populistische partijen mainstream media bekritiseren op Twitter,"Broekhoven, Marijke van","['Burger, J.P.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Uit onderzoek blijkt dat het vertrouwen van het publiek in de mainstream media de afgelopen jaren is afgenomen. Een gevaarlijke ontwikkeling, omdat dit ertoe kan leiden dat bepaalde groepen zich geheel afwenden van mainstream media en zich keren tot alternatieve media die het wantrouwen in klassieke kanalen voeden. De afname van dit vertrouwen is nauw verbonden aan de opkomst van alternatieve media en de populariteit van populistische partijen. Het vertrouwen in de mainstream media is een belangrijk thema in het discours van (rechts-)populisten. De afname van het vertrouwen in media en de rol van de politiek is in het verleden regelmatig onderwerp van onderzoek geweest. Daaruit bleek dat politici een vrij cynische en negatieve houding hebben ten opzichte van de media. Echter, in voorgaande studies is de mediakritiek van politici van populistische partijen op mainstream media nog niet vaak inhoudelijk onderzocht. En dat terwijl politici tot op zekere hoogte de macht hebben om de publieke opinie te beïnvloeden. De vraag is dus hoe de kritiek van deze politici eruit ziet. Voor de uitvoering van dit onderzoek zijn tweets verzameld van politici die lid zijn van een van de vijf populistische partijen die Nederland kent. Uit de kritische discoursanalyse blijkt dat politici, dan wel niet bewust, een breed scala aan discursieve strategieën omarmen om hun kritiek op mainstream media vorm te geven. Naast kritiek bevestigen de tweets ook de keerzijde van de afhankelijkheidsrelatie tussen politici en media: media-aandacht bezorgt politici publiciteit. Gezien de aard van het onderzoek is het niet mogelijk de uitkomsten te generaliseren. Een kwantitatief vervolgonderzoek dat zich richt op meerdere sociale media-kanalen, zou dan ook een logische vervolgstap zijn.","['journalistiek', 'discoursanalyse', 'mediakritiek']"

Immoral holidays: Child Sex Tourism in the Central Valley of Costa Rica,"Blain-Descormiers, Jade",['Havar Solheim'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Child sex tourism refers to the practice of seeking a sexual intercourse with a child in a foreign country. This phenomenon encompasses concepts of sex tourism, child prostitution or commercial sexual exploitation of children and children’s rights and it dynamizes by forces such as transnational organized crime, sex trafficking and of course, tourism. As such, child sex tourism is a complex and multi-layered practice, which should be taken seriously in terms of its gravity, notably in regard to violation to children’srights. In Costa Rica, a country renounced for being a touristic destination characterized by safety, nature and ‘exoticism’, child sex tourism is out of hand. The Central Valley and San José are indeed the playground of many sex tourists, mainly from North America, who seek sexual intercourse with young girls, exploiting their vulnerabilities and trampling their dignity. Child sex tourism is indeed a grave case of disregarded children’s rights, because it exposes the children to dramatic conditions. Attempts at putting an end to the practice in Costa Rica have been inefficient and impunity remains severe. It is crucial to remember the children are the victim of child sex tourism and should be the sole and unique priority while fighting it, because children should not suffer for the immorality of adults.",

Rechtvaardigheid en de menselijke natuur: de analogie van ziel en staat in Kallipolis en de Varkensstaat,"Mulders, Franciscus","['Haas, F. de']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Filosofie (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"The analogy of the city and the soul in Plato's ""Republic"" has often been criticised in academic literature, perhaps most famously by Bernard Williams in his 1973 essay ""The Analogy of City and Soul in Plato's Republic"". Building on the refutation of this criticism in an earlier essay, this thesis attempts to establish an integral interpretation of the city-soul analogy which is both conceptually and narratively adequate. A close study of the introduction of the analogy in book II of the ""Republic"" informs us that the analogy implies a similar structure between city and soul, but no correlation, and that it is not intended as an argument or principle, but rather as a guiding hypothesis for Socrates' experimental investigation of justice. This interpretation allows for the refutation of numerous criticisms of Plato's elaboration of the analogy in Callipolis. Finally, the combination of this interpretation with insight in the psychologically realist character of Callipolis, enables us to understand the working of the analogy in the ""City of Pigs"", and the role of this short-lived utopia in Plato's ethical and political theory, leading us to the conclusion that Plato's ""Republic"", if properly understood, is everything but a highlight of utopian thinking.","['Plato', 'Plato\'s ""Republic""', 'city-soul analogy', 'Bernard Williams', 'ethics', 'political philosophy', 'utopia', '""city of pigs""']"

Hidden wars: Proxy wars and their significance for the future of warfare,"Ponce de Leon, Ruben PdL",['Dr. Sarah Cramsey'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since the invention of the nuclear bomb, the way warfare has been conducted has changed drastically and has led to the invention of new strategies to engage in warfare, one of them being proxy wars. This thesis clarifies the term proxy war as well as the benefits that come with its usage through the analysis of the news coverage of the Yemeni war from two “Western” news outlets, namely The Guardian and Der Spiegel. The study answers the research question; how Western news coverage makes invisible wars visible and to what extent they do so? To do so, it will look at all the articles issued by both news outlets between March 2019 and March 2022. It will first do a content analysis in which it will contrast the arguments presented in the literature review with the content of the articles and then conduct a discourse analysis with the objective of demonstrating possible intentions that lie behind the news outlets’ coverage of the war. Findings demonstrate that both news outlets succeed in presenting the war in Yemen as a proxy war although they do so in different ways. Moreover, they determine that The Guardian has an intention of influencing its readership’s opinion about the war through the denunciation of the UK’s involvement in Yemen and the description of the war as a humanitarian catastrophe. The conclusion of this thesis underlines the responsibility news outlets have when informing about war because of their ability to uncover hidden interests and power plays between states and non-state actors that other ways would be hidden.","['proxy war', 'warfare', 'Yemen']"

Zo worden de concepten mediakritiek, alternatieve media en framing vanuit een Nederlandse context benaderd, en creëert dit onderzoek inzicht in de groeiende weerstand en aversie jegens grote media te begrijpen. Op basis van een uiteenzetting van de discussies rondom de termen alternatieve media, mediakritiek, autoriteit en framing, is de kwalitatieve framinganalyse van artikelen, podcasts en video’s in drie verschillende alternatieve media uitgevoerd. De resultaten en analyse, gepresenteerd in een matrix, geven antwoord op de onderzoeksvraag ‘Hoe worden mainstream media geframed in de berichtgeving van Nederlandse alternatieve media?’. Uit de analyse blijkt dat de onderzochte alternatieve media één frame hanteren, waarbij mediakritiek gefocust op de integriteit, professionaliteit en geloofwaardigheid van individuele journalisten, specifieke media, of het hele mediasysteem, continu wordt geuit. Op basis van de beschreven literatuur is te concluderen dat de aangetroffen vormen van mediakritiek geen positieve invloed hebben op de democratiserende werking van genuanceerde mediakritiek.","['Media, alternatieve media, mediakritiek, framing, framingsanalyse']"

"A Novel, A Game, or a 'Glorified PowerPoint Slideshow'? Otome Visual Novels as Contemporary Ergodic Literature","Buesink, Maria Antonia",['Dr. Fleur Praal'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis establishes the Japanese otome visual novel genre of media as a new, digital type of immersive multimodal reading for women. Otome revives the bygone late 20th-century academic debate on interactive fiction, as the subgenre challenges the categories of media as we understand them: the otome visual novel format combines romantically-themed prose with visual, audial, and interactive elements. Otome visual novels evoke a feeling of influence over the plot progression through interactivity, yet present walls of text as their method of story-building and therefore require a significant amount of reading, which could preclude their consideration as either literature or games per se. Because of this generic ambiguity, visual novels have long been overlooked in academia. This thesis presents a comprehensive analysis of otome visual novels as part of Japanese (women’s) reading habits using Espen Aarseth’s concept of ‘ergodic literature’, supported by theory from Reading Studies, Literature Studies, and Game Studies. In doing so, this thesis sheds light on the subgenre’s immense popularity in its country of origin and illuminates its unique position to bridge the academic fields of Literature Studies and Game Studies in the digital age.","['otome', 'visual novels', 'ergodic literature', 'multimodality', 'immersive reading', 'Japanese reading habits', 'game studies']"

While several aspects of this manuscript have already received scholarly attention (in particular its colophon and decoration), this thesis presents a first comprehensive study into the history and contents of the codex. It focuses in particular on the way(s) in which the book was customized for the use by Aef van Bolgerien. Books of Hours were often made to order, meaning their contents could be adjusted to the preferences of the comissioner. As a result, while Books of Hours are the most surviving type of texts from the Middle Ages, they show great variety among them. As the selection of additional prayers in particular is specific to each copy, they offer insight into both the relgious practice of the first owner and, in general, into the practice of customising Books of Hours. For this reason, the eleven additional prayers contained in BPL 2747 were chosen to be transcribed and edited as part of the thesis. In the first chapter, the historical developments surrounding the production and use of the Book of Hours are discussed, focussing on developments in lay religious culture, the Devotio Moderna, and the vernacular translation of the Hours that was created in this context. The second chapter introduces the manuscript central to the study, BPL 2747, and provides insight into elements such as the materiality, provenance and decorations of the book. The third chapter contains a transcription of the prayers separate from the Hours. The final chapter, chapter 4, adresses the dissemination of the prayers and what they may tell us about van Bolgerien’s devotional practice.","['Book of Hours', 'Manuscript', 'Middle Ages', 'Middle Dutch', 'Religion', 'Prayer', 'Devotio Moderna', 'Moderne Devotie', 'Book History']"

Kwalitatief onderzoek naar hoe Nederlandse opinietijdschriften omgaan met verwijzingen naar LHBTIQ+-personen,"Eickhoff, Jessie","['Vandendaele, A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Taal speelt een centrale rol in hoe mensen denken en zich gedragen (Verhaeghe, 2020, p. 5), ook qua discriminatie van LHBTIQ+-personen. Mensen die binnen de media met inclusief taalgebruik in aanraking komen, gaan deze taal vaker zelf gebruiken (Van Poecke et al., 1991, p. 83). Binnen deze scriptie wordt onderzocht hoe de Nederlandse opiniebladen Vrij Nederland, Elsevier Weekblad, De Groene Amsterdammer, HP/De Tijd en Maarten! omgaan met verwijzingen naar LHBTIQ+-personen. Het doel is om inzicht te krijgen in de taalkeuzes van opiniebladen m.b.t. LHBTIQ+-personen en hoe dit er in de praktijk uitziet. Aan de hand van semi-gestructureerde interviews is onderzocht welke opvattingen eindredacteuren en hoofdredacteuren over inclusief taalgebruik omtrent LHBTIQ+-personen hebben. Door middel van een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse is onderzocht hoe in de periode oktober 2016 tot maart 2022 naar LHBTIQ+-personen verwezen werd in opiniebladen. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat opiniebladen op het vlak van taalontwikkelingen meegaan met de modus, kwetsende termen vermijden en geen duidelijke voorkeur hebben voor identity-first language of person-first language. Voorstanders van person-first language willen dat een persoon in eerste plaats als persoon wordt gezien en in de tweede plaats als een persoon met een bepaalde eigenschap, terwijl bij identity-first language de focus ligt op een bepaalde eigenschap als onlosmakelijk deel van de identiteit (Simonsen & Mruczek, 2021). De Groene Amsterdammer gaf aan een voorkeur te hebben voor identity-first bijvoeglijk naamwoord (bijv. homoseksuele man), person-first language (bijv. man die op mannen valt) of werkwoorden (bijv. hij valt op mannen). Elsevier Weekblad heeft de voorkeur voor identity-first bijvoeglijk naamwoord. Maarten! heeft de voorkeur voor werkwoorden. HP/De Tijd heeft de voorkeur voor identity-first zelfstandig naamwoord (bijv. homo). Vrij Nederland gaf geen voorkeur aan. In de praktijk verwijzen deze opiniebladen het meest naar LHBTIQ+-personen door middel van termen die hun gender of seksuele oriëntatie reduceren tot het geheel of tot een deel van hun identiteit. De meeste termen behoorden tot identity-first zelfstandig naamwoord, gevolgd door identity-first bijvoeglijk naamwoord, gevolgd door person-first, gevolgd door werkwoorden. Concluderend, de meeste termen waarmee opiniebladen verwijzen naar LHBTIQ+-personen reduceren de gender of seksuele oriëntatie tot iemands identiteit. Verder gaan opiniebladen op het gebied van taalontwikkelingen mee met de modus en vermijden ze kwetsende termen.","['taal', 'LHBTIQ+', 'opiniebladen', 'media', 'verwijzingen']"

Despite the proliferation of scholarship about the complexity of Islamic practices and experiences of Muslims in the West, (immigrant) Muslim women are still plagued with homogenizing assumptions that relegate them to the realm of the passive or the dangerous. We Are Lady Parts demonstrates these realities while also offering alternative ways of understanding Muslim women by centering universal issues of faith, friendship, love and belonging. Using postcolonial and feminist theoretical frameworks, I aim to understand how unconventional representations of punk Muslim women undermine current patriarchal and colonial discourses both in Muslim and non-Muslim communities. I pay special attention to the women’s gender performativity and the ways in which it enables performative agency in their musical performances. I then address the heterogeneity of the characters’ identities by analyzing how they navigate their desires, romantic relationships, and religion. Finally, I examine the ways in which the women are excluded from embracing a British identity and how they form alternative paths to belonging via sisterhood and a decolonial worldview.","['Muslim women', 'faith', 'belonging', 'Islamic feminism']"

Ranging from paranormal encounters to neurophysiological health to algorithmic control, there is a plethora of invisible phenomena that dominate western culture. Because these things live outside of human perception, they require extra steps to prove their existence. Historically, photography has been a useful tool to capture the invisible. This thesis will investigate the representation of invisibility and its aesthetic forms in the twenty-first century. Specifically, with a focus on new media art. Melting Memories is an artwork by Refik Anadol which discusses the elusive nature of our memory. To represent memory as a tangible object, Anadol has leaned heavily on a photographic history as well as on a transparent aesthetic and policy that is projected onto the algorithmic. Moreover, this transparency is rooted in a photographic spectrality that has been redefined to fit new technology. Melting Memories is a reimagining of real neurophysiological data on memory collection in a way that touches on memory preservation and individual versus collective experiences. The artwork is an ode to memory and a celebration of its changeable nature that was meant to combat the morbid truths of memory loss. By incorporating all these themes, this work becomes a productive case study for investigating the alleged dichotomy between the invisible and the visible in the current media landscape.","['Indexicality, Spectrality, Photography, New Media, Machine Learning']"

Hoewel de samenleving sindsdien resistenter is geworden tegen het virus zelf door preventie en vaccinatie, zijn er veel complexe maatschappelijke problemen naar voren gekomen als gevolg van de pandemie. Het toepassen van de constructieve beeldjournalistiek kan uitkomst bieden om deze gevolgen begrijpelijker en positiever over te brengen naar het publiek. Jennifer Midberry en Nicole Smith Dahmen hebben met het onderzoek Visual Solutions Journalism: A Theoretical Framework (2020) reeds onderzocht dat beelden constructief vorm krijgen door volledigheid, nauwkeurigheid en menselijkheid. Hierbij hebben de auteurs zich wel beperkt tot de fotografie, terwijl in de journalistiek nog veel meer typen beelden worden toepast. Zo kunnen nieuwsredacties ook gebruik maken van ontworpen illustraties als tekeningen en grafische ontwerpen om de verslaggeving te duiden. In dit scriptieonderzoek is daarom onderzocht hoe de constructieve elementen vorm krijgen in ontworpen illustraties over de maatschappelijke gevolgen van de coronapandemie. Aan de hand van literatuuronderzoek en een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse, onderverdeeld in een thematische inhoudsanalyse en een sociaal-semiotische analyse, is onderzocht hoe de constructieve beeldjournalistiek vorm krijgt in ontworpen illustraties over de coronapandemie. Uit de thematische inhoudsanalyse is naar voren gekomen hoe de constructieve elementen volledigheid, nauwkeurigheid en menselijkheid vorm krijgen in ontworpen illustraties. De sociaal-semiotische analyse is toegepast om te onderzoeken hoe pandemische beeldtaal met betrekking tot het coronavirus vorm krijgt aan de hand van betekenisgeving die voortkomt uit de representatie, compositie en interactie bij ontworpen illustraties. De bevindingen uit dit scriptieonderzoek wijzen erop dat de constructieve beeldjournalistiek op meer manieren vorm krijgt dan voorheen is onderzocht. Met ontworpen illustraties kunnen nieuwsredacties overzichtelijk de gevolgen van de coronapandemie in beeld brengen en duidelijke plannen van aanpak formuleren voor de samenleving.",

This thesis attempts to answer whether ancient Greek drinkers who did not drink according to the drinking rules of the social group they belonged to (and did so in an excessive fashion) were viewed as behaving in a pathological way from a socio-cultural point of view (to stress: not from a bio-medical one). The study heavily depends on research from the social sciences that focuses on the social function of alcohol consumption, mainly Douglas 1987, and concludes by saying that in ancient Greece certain social conditions that are crucial for a a socio-cultural pathology of problematic drinking to develop were absent in ancient Greek society. Therefore, it appears as improbable that a socio-cultural pathology for 'problematic drinking' was already conceptualised in the ancient Greek world. The aim of the thesis primarily was to contribute to the field of Classics that studies ancient mental illnesses and to attempt to provide more information on the ancient Greek mind and social world. However, the findings also underline that alcoholism, the modern pathology for problematic drinking, should not be perceived as a universal concept, but as a relative one that depends heavily on the current milieu of the modern world.","['Ancient Drinking, Wine, Ancient Pathology, Ancient Mind, Consumption']"

J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"To linger between two worlds; to perceive the doorway to another reality and to cross — voluntarily or not — the threshold is often the destiny of the literary hero or heroine. This thesis critically examines the function of portals in such fiction and analyses the extent to which moving between the different realities facilitates character transformation for the protagonist. Over the past decades, Neil Gaiman has become one of the most successful authors of portal-fantasy; therefore, this thesis will focus on three of Gaiman’s novels to determine the nature of the portals operating within them. Chapter 1 will discuss the themes of escapism, alienation, and the desire to cross boundaries into unrealistic settings. Another concept to examine is the notion of liminality. Liminality is the state of being in between two worlds and belonging to neither, or belonging to both. The following three chapters will aim their attention at the portals that lead to liminal spaces in Neverwhere (1996), The Graveyard Book (2008) and The Ocean at the End of the Lane (2013). Each chapter contains three sections, which examine the nature of the portal that leads to the other world, the alien beings and concepts that the protagonist encounters in the secondary world, and the transformation that the protagonist undergoes during their experience of crossing into the these worlds. The thesis investigates the extent to which this transformation relates to the two worlds that the protagonist moves between. Another aim of the thesis, relating to transformation, is to show whether the portals in these narratives lead into a literal and metaphoric darkness, where the protagonist is forced to confront a trauma or hardship, or into light, serving as a domain of consolation, or relief from anguish. The conclusion will show that the ability to traverse between two worlds through a portal in these novels reshapes the protagonists’ understanding of the world around them in very different ways.","['portals, liminality, Neil Gaiman, escapism, transformation']"

It participates in sound rules like other phonemes and has prosodic uses in turn-holding and signaling syllable boundaries. Studies on Maltese have suggested the glottal stop can occur both as a phoneme and as a prosodic effect (Mitterer et al., 2021). The present study had 28 participants listen and rate the comprehensibility and fluency of utterances with a glottal stop or a glottal stop unpronounced in an online experiment. The participants rated the items without a glottal stop significantly lower than the items with a glottal stop. The ratings were significantly affected by the likelihood that specific suffixes occur with a glottal stop. The findings suggest that a glottal stop between two separate words is a phoneme that only occurs with certain suffixes. The results concerning compound words were inconclusive and the effect of identical vowels around the glottal stop should be further investigated.","['Glottal stop', 'Phoneme', 'Prosody', 'Finnish phonology']"

This is largely due to its similarities with old eugenics policies, as well as trends seen in healthcare practice and access for other innovative medical technologies (e.g. geographical practice variations, and socio-economic disparities in access to care and medical innovativeness). Currently taking part in these debates are the scientific community, historians, and ethicists. As such, the public does not yet have a seat at the table, though this is necessary to devise succesful policies and regulations pertinent to the (potential) wider adoption of GETs in the healthcare system. Therefore, this study aims to gauge the public perception on GETs, while accounting for Race and Level of Education. More specifically, this study focusses on the predictiveness of said variables for the degree to which one is accepting of GETs, and to what extent they fear that GETs are discriminatory in nature. This is achieved by means of multiple linear regressions. It was found that Race and Level of Education were insignificantly predictive of acceptance of gene editing technologies (R2 = .002, F(2, 137) = .154, p = .857). Further, they were insignificantly predictive of fear of gene editing technologies being discriminatory (R2 = .036, F(2, 130) = 2.441, p = .091).","['acceptance', 'discrimination', 'race', 'education', 'gene editing technology']"

The research method is a systematic literature review, implemented from a Life Cycle Thinking perspective. This includes reviewing the options to improve resource efficiency in the different stages in the fashion industry. Reviewing the ways that clothing is discarded and disposed of in cities and identifying potential solutions to improve the circularity and resource efficiency of citizens’ clothing consumption. Special attention has been put on the use of smart technology to unlock the circularity potential. Two business cases –Byewaste and MUD Jeans– were drawn upon as the study cases to demonstrate the possibilities. The main findings of the research include the opportunities and environmental barriers for each stage, which are usage of multiple aspects such as, (fresh) water; energy, from unsustainable means, such as coal and oil; toxic chemicals for different processes in each stage; and valuable resources for fibre production, such as cotton, wool, wood, petrochemicals. Byewaste and MUD Jeans, both provide solutions as opportunities to make urban clothing consumption sustainable, and circular, to a certain extent. Urban governance would be able to unlock further barriers, to further facilitate opportunities. Alongside that are the limitations of CE, ethical and social implications of the current fashion industry, and FF that is one of the main drives of urban overconsumption. Finally, suggestions to raise the awareness of citizens for more environmentally friendly clothing consumption are proposed.","['Circular Fashion, Urban Clothing Consumption, Circular Economy, Life Cycle Thinking, Sustainability']"

In the Netherlands, the idea of cycling culture is deeply cemented into the society. By investigating the role of culture on cycling behaviour, specific place-based policies and interventions can be applied to induce cycling behaviour. Previous research showed that cycling uptake is a gradual process and thus this study investigated how cycling behaviour differed across the number of years of residence in the Netherlands of international students. The theory of planned behaviour is commonly used as a means to predict cycling intentions and behaviour. Thus, this thesis has investigated the effect exposure to Dutch culture on the variables of the theory of planned behaviour. A survey was administered among international students in the Netherlands. The results revealed that the number of years of residence in the Netherlands had a non- significant relationship with all the variables, indicating that cycling uptake is not a linear process, but instead one that fluctuates over time, due to a multitude of personal, societal, and infrastructural variables. Additionally, it was identified that the variables of the theory of planned behaviour are correlated with each other. These findings are vital because they contribute to existing literature. Moreover, the obtained results can be utilised by policymakers in the Netherlands to adapt not only soft infrastructural strategies but also to improve the built environment in promoting cycling behaviour for foreigners.","['cycling, culture, theory of planned behaviour, attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioural control, infrastructure, urban planning']"

French Far-Right Candidates and Their Negative Image of the City,"Leroux, Alice",['Alistair Kefford'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis provides an analysis of the far-right discourse of Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour during the French presidential election of 2022 regarding their image of the city. It also explores the way both leaders, respectively of Le Rassemblement National and Reconquête!, use a negative picture of the city and the suburbs as a tool to increase their political appeal. The research covers the differences between the visions of both parties and the strategy they employ to gain popularity among voters. The main findings are that, first, the issues urban multiculturalism raises in the organisation of cities are used to excuse xenophobic views and justify anti-immigration solutions. Second, both candidates evoke the role of common memory to create division between native French and immigrants. Third, the two far-right candidates use Islamophobic views, supported by the fear of terrorism, to paint a negative image of the suburbs, to further argue that French values are fading. Fourth, both parties use the crime rate present in the “quartiers” to magnify the fear of immigrants and the sense of populism of the French voters. Overall, Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour target an audience that is unfamiliar with urban issues in order to be elected by oversimplifying the problems and solutions to these issues.",['Quartiers – Multiculturalism – Far-right Strategies – Islamophobia – Urban Safety']
Life cycle environmental impacts of the electric vehicles in China: an extensive literature review,"Zhang, Hanyang","['Hu, M.', 'Xu, C.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"China is the world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) market, possessing 4.5 million EVs in 2020, far ahead of the second-place country - the U.S., with 1.7 million EVs in the same period (Silver, 2021). This is because the government promotes EVs as the future of urban mobility due to its low emission characteristic (Iea.org, 2020). However, some researchers argue, that if considering the production and disposal of the vehicles and EV batteries, the life cycle environmental impacts of EVs can be much bigger and EVs may not be as ‘clean’ as most people have thought (Yu, et al., 2018). This is especially true for China, where the electricity generation is still highly relying on high polluting coal-fired plants, landfilling is used for EV and battery disposal that generate enamours negative environmental impacts, the resources for battery production are not secured, and so on (Eguchi, et al., 2020, Song, et al., 2016, Liu, et al., 2020). It is urgent for now to study how to mitigate or solve these environment impacts. Through an extensive literature review, this research has identified the key factors influencing the life cycle environmental impacts of EVs in China. The key findings are summarized as following. At the production stage, most of the environmental impacts are caused by the EV barratries production, including reduces the resource security as it requires a large amount of cobalt, lithium, coal, and such. These resources are non-renewable and some of the extraction rate is very low (Liu, et al., 2020, Zeng, wt al., 2015); it also generates air and water pollution since the electricity to support EV production in China is mainly generated from coal-fired plants (Eguchi, et al., 2020). At the utilization stage, there is normally no direct impact to the environment, but the electricity output efficiency in China is very low, meaning more coal are required and more pollution would be generated to support the EV charging (Jiang, 2019); also, thermal hazard may happen occasionally under abusive condition, for example, in car crashing (Ouyang, et al., 2019). At the end-of-life stage, landfilling is the most common method to dispose EVs and EV batteries in China. Reduces resource security as it make valuable materials on EV uncoverable, generate heavy metal pollution, and reduce food security as landfilling disfunction the agricultural land (Costa, et al., 2021, Song, et al., 2016, Zeng, II et al., 2015, Tencent New, 2019, People.cn, 2020); nevertheless, most of the environmental impacts can be mitigated or solved by recycling the EV and EV battery, yet, there is no clear standards as well as agenda for both EV and EV battery recycling in China (Song, et al., 2016, Shu, et al., 2021, Yu, et al., 2020, Casper, et al., 2020, Abdullah, 2021). Accordingly, recommendations are proposed to shed a light on the sustainable transition of urban mobility, assuring ‘cleaner’ pathways for future EV development in China. Switching the current electricity generation system to more sustainable ones can mitigate the environmental impacts generated from EV and EV battery production, and EV charging. Reducing or phasing out the current EV subsidy scheme and encourage car-sharing. Setting up clear standards as well as proper agenda to facilitate EVs and EV batteries recycling is able to enhance the resource security for EV and EV battery production, and the environmental impacts generated from landfilling. Additionally, promote alternative subject which is more sustainable is also a possible solution. Nevertheless, the whole life cycle of the value chain for the alternative subjects must be examined to indicate the sustainability before promotion.","['Electric Vehicles (EVs)', 'Resource Efficiency', 'Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)', 'China']"
Juvenile Knife Crime in Rotterdam,"Smallegange, Tristan","['Heijden, M.P.C. van der']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the last years, the media published numerous articles about juvenile knife crime in Rotterdam. In many of these articles it becomes clear that two assumptions are made. First, the assumption that juvenile knife crime in Rotterdam is increasing. Second, the assumption of a causal relationship between drill music and juvenile knife crime. However, most of the claims about rising numbers and a causal relation between drill music and juvenile knife crime are based on general assumptions which are not supported by evident-based research. Since scholars argue that there are reasons other than drill music for juveniles committing a knife crime, this thesis focuses on the question: “to what extent is drill music reflected in the motives of juveniles committing knife crime in Rotterdam in the judgements of the court of Rotterdam in the period 2013-2022?” The thesis starts with an overview of drill music and a description of the context of Rotterdam. Thereafter, an analysis of 63 judgements published by the court of Rotterdam was conducted. This thesis identified the motives of juveniles that committed a knife crime in Rotterdam. Additionally, the number of juveniles involved in knife crime over the years was analyzed in order to examine if it is actually increasing. The findings of this research indicate that drill music is not reflected in the motives of juveniles that committed a knife crime in Rotterdam in the period 2013-2022. Instead of drill music, poor mental health, engagement with delinquent peers, or facilitating a robbery were the three most common reasons Furthermore, juvenile knife crime in Rotterdam has been increasing since 2019 based on the judgements.",
Smart City Technologies in the Context of the Covid-19 Pandemic,"Čechová, Katarína",['Dr. Alistair Kefford'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Smart city technologies are seen as the next step of urban evolution, but because of their development, goals, and sometimes limited regulations they raise privacy concerns.

The academic literature analysis of this paper explores the notions of privacy in smart cities, sensitive information, what impacts people’s willingness to provide sensitive information, and technologies used during Covid-19. The primary research explores how smart city technologies were experienced and viewed by individuals from European countries (in addition to a number of individuals from the United Kingdom and India) in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, and how they felt about their privacy in this context. The results of primary research conducted for this paper show how context impacts people’s eagerness to share sensitive data, and how the purpose of personal data collection can impact the use of technologies.","['Smart Cities, Privacy, Sensitive Information, Covid-19, Apps']"
Social effects of community urbanism: A practical Approach to evaluating community gardens,"Thierfelder, Jonathan","['Kefford, A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis discusses the social effects of grassroots involvement in public space through the example of community gardens in Berlin. These spaces exist within processes of change, influencing neighbourhoods both positively and negatively, while also being at risk of displacement. Studying bottom-up engagement within public space informs urban planning of local knowledge, which is essential in creating nuanced, people-oriented policy decisions. While top down approaches of the past have failed to recognize local social effects and drawbacks, a value assessment approach, drawing from Historic urban landscapes, and valuation theory has the opportunity to recognize the plethora of social effects from Grassroots action, and inform decision making. The study investigates what forms of social effects community gardens create within the city, and how these can be better recognised in policy making. The study aims to investigate the creation of new means of valuing the spaces, and understanding how social values are created. The paper is an innovative composite approach that draws on theoretical literature, primary data, and builds a novel framework for evaluating qualitative social effects around community urbanism. While community use of space has strong opportunities for unity, neighbourhood culture, and bottom-up involvement in planning, the delinations of community have the potential to exclude, and damage people's social networks and neighbourhood culture. The value assessment approach recognises the nuance of local knowledge, and could be applied to all sorts of shared urban spaces, such as parks, squares, and streets where grassroots urbanism takes place. Qualitative value assessment such as this framework could allow stakeholders to create more liveable, people oriented neighbourhoods.","['Community Urbanism', 'Qualitative Valuation', 'Social Change']"

M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Urban farming could be considered as a means of improving several aspects of city life, such as sustainable food provisioning, healthy living environments, climate change effects, and people’s social well-being. Allotment gardening is an increasingly common urban farming initiative, which is an assigned individually-owned plot of land in the city where people could, for example, grow fruits and vegetables, spend time outdoors, or meet other gardeners. Yet, there can be various motivational indicators for why people start practising urban allotment gardening. Despite previous research studies on motivations to contribute to urban farming initiatives, there is still a need to investigate certain research gaps. These include people’s motivation to contribute to urban allotment gardening, and possible differences in motivations between age groups. This research investigates the main motivational indicators of allotment garden owners in Rotterdam, to see whether environmental issues, such as climate change play a role in people's motivation or not. Additionally, the differences in motivational indicators between five age groups were investigated to see whether age has an effect on motivation. A questionnaire survey was conducted, of which the respondents contained 119 practitioners of 12 different urban allotment organisations based in Rotterdam. The results showed that most of the respondents have their allotment garden to spend their leisure time. Additionally, it was found that the interaction between age group and motivational indicator was not significant (p = 0.56). A more extensive research study is required to conclusively understand how the age of allotment gardeners is linked to motivations.","['Urban Farming, Allotment Gardening, Motivation, Age differences, Rotterdam, The Netherlands']"
Planned vs. Lived: An Analysis of the Planning Practices and Relations of Power Involved in Addis Ababa’s Integrated Housing Development Programme (IHDP),"Persson, Hanna","['Kefford, A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"According to UN Habitat, nearly 80% of Addis Ababa’s inner city consists of slums – a figure that has rapidly been changing due to the Integrated Housing Development Programme (IHDP): a government-led programme launched between 2005 and 2017 to redevelop inner-city slum areas and subsequently rehouse low- and middle-income residents in peripherally located, subsidised condominium flats. In clearing inner-city land, the IHDP has prompted large-scale displacement of communities and paved way for private sector-led redevelopment. Meanwhile, the relocation to condominiums has been challenging for former slum dwellers as they have had to undergo drastic spatial and lifestyle changes. Such urban transitions have raised questions about the ‘selling out’ of existing communities and who Addis Ababa’s redevelopment is for. Through a discourse analysis, this thesis critically examines how governmental bodies have framed and implemented the IHDP in comparison to the experiences of local populations. Specifically, legal documents informing processes of slum clearance and resettlement to condominiums have been studied within a conceptual framework derived from Scott and Harvey, among other scholars, against the accounts of affected residents. From this study, it becomes clear that the IHDP has been applied in a top-down manner, making a radical departure from local needs and traditions, and furthering the government’s interests of creating a modern and globally competitive city. The thesis concludes that the ‘metis’ found and practiced in disappearing slum settlements needs to be incorporated in the city’s redevelopment plans to reinvent what constitutes a ‘new’, but social and spatially just, Addis Ababa.","['Addis Ababa', 'housing', 'relocation', 'slum clearance', 'metis.']"
Who is to blame?

The fire was the deadliest fire since WWI, killing at least 72 people. To prevent future disasters, domestically and internationally it is important to assess responsibility. Past scholarly articles have suggested several societal factors that may have caused the Grenfell Tower fire; social murder, austerity, and racism/colonialism however a gap in research lies in the understanding of the general public and who they hold accountable. This thesis provides a news framing discourse analysis of the Grenfell Tower fire. The analysis focuses on how newspapers shape the discourse surrounding the responsibility of the fire. It then examines the difference between British newspapers and the scholarly literature regarding who is held responsible, revealing a striking difference in how the causation and who is held responsible are presented. While the scholarly literature engages more in systemic issues the newspapers held more surface-level ideas. The implications of this study show that the general public will have an insufficient understanding of what caused the Grenfell Tower fire and what social issues need to be addressed to resolve the aftermath and prevent future disasters of the same nature.",['Grenfell Tower - Fire safety - Blame analyses - Inequality - news media']

Starting with the permanent settlement of non-Western guest-workers in countries such as the Netherlands and Germany, the debate concerning integration and compatibility with Western values has been high on the agenda. A key concern in regards to this, is the maintenance of social cohesion. Putnam has argued that social cohesion can be formed through increasing social capital, within and between different groups. Religious associations have been considered essential to bridge between groups and create social capital. However, the ongoing political debates and portrayals of mosques and Muslims affect the mutual trust that is fundamental to social capital. In this paper, I will examine the role of mosques in the creation of social cohesion (SCH) and social capital (SC). I will do so by forming a theoretical framework surrounding the two concepts and determining the relevant indicators. After this, an assessment of the position and portrayal of Mosques and Muslims in the Netherlands will demonstrate the consequences of perceptions on social trust. Finally, I will analyse the interviews I have conducted with volunteers at the Centrum de Middenweg mosque in Rotterdam and several residents, based on the indicators I have found in the literature. My results display that a mosque can contribute to the social cohesion in a neighbourhood despite the discourse, by creating a welcoming ambiance and being in constant interaction with the residents.","['Social Cohesion, Social Capital, Neighbourhood, Rotterdam, Mosques']"
Inclusive Climate Resilience in the City of The Hague,"Lindén, Linnea Elisabeth",['Roy P. Remme'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"A growing density of grey infrastructure and populations in urban areas has created artificial climates that lack the natural ability to regulate rising temperatures, absorb stormwater, and maintain biodiversity. To counter this concerning trend, policy-making at all levels has begun prioritizing the enhancement of climate resilience through the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBSs), which aim to mimic the natural ecosystem services that are being diminished. These can be implemented in the already existing stock of buildings and help alleviate the many climate stressors that urban citizens face. Given the large proportion of homeowners in these areas, citizen participation in these solutions has become increasingly important. It is crucial that citizen participation is kept inclusive of all income groups in order to protect the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change and to prevent the exacerbation of social inequality. This paper seeks to uncover how the citizen-led implementation of one particular NBS, namely green roofs, are being inclusively promoted in the city of The Hague. Through statistical analyses of secondary data, map analyses, and qualitative analyses of survey and interview answers, my research finds that since green roofs are primarily installed in higher-income areas, it is crucial for the municipality to promote these technologies among lower-income residents. However, it becomes clear that the current subsidisation scheme is insufficient at undertaking this task due to its insufficient ability to remove both economic and knowledge barriers. The paper concludes by offering potential solutions, such as a restructured incentive scheme and increased campaigning, to improve the municipality’s approach to inclusive resilience-enhancement.","['Green roofs, nature-inclusive design, inclusive urban planning, climate policy.']"

The everchanging, avant-garde mannerisms of Tokyo’s subcultures are undismissable when regarding the urban cultural fabric. The amalgam of spatial destruction, reconstruction, and revitalisation has offered the city vital cultural byproducts: subcultures— (non-)spaces: fields of belonging— and individualism: the idiosyncratic nature of individuals. Economic challenges and societal unification have generated complex social subgroups, both parallel and perpendicular to Tokyo’s homogenised society, with separate groups imbuing their versions of idealism and utopia upon physical space and community. 1 Tokyo is a unique focal point for subcultural studies because of the fact that the relationship between spatial belonging and social groups has progressed over time to sociospatial ownership and domination. Within Tokyo, this phenomena affects innumerable (sub-)spaces, making subcultural study of direct relevance to understanding the lattice of Tokyo’s social networks along with other megacity structures.",
Urban flooding: A comparative analysis of flood risk management policies and adaptation plans between Belgium and the Netherlands,"Rooij, Marcus de","['Kefford, A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The continuous urbanisation of our surroundings has led to an increase in environmental problems. In addition to the process of urbanisation negatively impacting the quality of our environment, it also directly supports climate change. Consequently, the two major global trends lead to a notable increase in the unpredictability and magnitude of flooding hazards that can cause substantial damage to cities and their population. Though there are preliminary flood prevention strategies already in place, governments and policymakers struggle to formulate more integrated approaches and policies so as to fully prevent adverse consequences originating from extreme flooding events. This thesis studies the extreme pluvial floods that have severely affected many countries and regions in Western Europe, leading to economic decline, infrastructural damages, and loss of life. During two days in July 2021, the sudden appearance of these urban pluvial floods has left many countries such as Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands devastated by the destruction of their cities and villages as many areas were left submerged underwater. In an effort to understand the effectiveness of already existent adaptation plans and water management policies in averting potential flood events, this paper will provide a comparative analysis of said policies and plans for both the Netherlands and Belgium. Hence, their approach to water management policies will be investigated to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures implemented prior to the extreme urban floods, followed by an evaluation of the adaptations of these policies after the events.","['Climate change', 'Urbanisation', 'Urban (pluvial) flooding', 'Resilient cities', 'Flood risk management', 'Flood adaptation plan', 'Water management policies', 'Belgium', 'The Netherlands']"

This thesis analyses the state of the contemporary Italian housing policy and its repercussions on the national and local provision and function of social housing. The paper also seeks to illustrate the structure behind the provision of social housing in Italy, with a particular focus on the complex mechanisms that govern nationallocal relations. Drawing from Italian and International literature, macro-trends such as residualisation, neoliberalism, and privatisation are discussed in the Italian context in order to identify relevance and scope of the latter. To understand these trends in the urban environment, two major urban areas are studied in their social housing composition, function, and provision. The findings highlight how a lack of national interest in and commitment to public housing policy, together with a high fragmentation in the organization, hinder the development of an organic system of public provision of housing. However, the local examples prove that on the urban level several initiatives are taking innovative steps in spite of the national context.","['Italy', 'Housing Policy', 'Social Housing']"
Broadcast Media and the Creation of Pop Icons: The Case of Italian Pop Icon - Raffaella Carrà,"Sheikh, Niki Miss",['Thijs Witty'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Raffaella Carrà (1943-2021) was an Italian actor, singer and television presenter with a career that spanned over fifty years (1960-2000s), achieving international fame by the 1970s, particularly within Europe and Latin America. Carrà’s stardom was marked by her controversial stance with regards to sex and freedom of sexuality. She had an extensive fan base and went on to be heralded as an icon of women’s liberation and the LGBTQ+ movement. She broke the well-established image of what an Italian woman should be, re-appropriated the significance of femininity and broke bounds of tradition. Carrà had a multi-faceted career, however, she owed the longevity of her presence in the public eye and her status as a pop icon to her collaboration with the Italian national broadcasting channels of the RAI (Radiotelevisione Italia). Under the control of a government-run administrative body, the RAI as all other vestiges of Italian society, was under the influence of both religious and political conservativism of the post WWII years. Carrà stepped into the public visual space on a stage provided to her by the RAI, during a period where Italy faced both political turmoil domestically and stood in the path of strong winds of change that blew across the Western world at large. This thesis will analyse how Raffaella Carrà used television as a space to promote message of change and equality for the conservative Italian society. Her iconicity will be examined through textual analysis of her lyrics and the visual analysis of her image. The three-way interplay between audience, broadcast media and pop icon will be studied through the eyes of cultural critics. It will be shown that Carrà stepped onto the public stage with agency. By recognising and directly addressing the concerns of her multifarious audience, she refined the concept of television audiencehood in Italy and opened space for the marginalised members of society.","['Raffaella Carrà, RAI, pop icon, audience, culture and broadcast media, culture and nation building!']"

"Receptivity of Contrastive Focus Reduplication in Dutch: The Roles of Interpretation, Co-Text, Age, and Gender","Vermeulen, Martijn","['Audring, J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Contrastive focus reduplication (CR) is one of many types of reduplication. CR constructions can be interpreted in a number of different ways and often occur in specific co-texts. The present paper presents a quantitative investigation into CR in Dutch, taking data from a questionnaire containing constructed examples of CR in which participants were asked to share how they interpret the examples and whether they would use them themselves. Specifically, the following aspects are investigated: interpretation, co-text, age of the participant, and gender of the participant. Furthermore, the concept of receptivity (from multilingualism studies) is introduced, which helps explain why participants understand constructions they would not use themselves. It emerges that there are correlations between certain characteristic types of co-texts and CR interpretations, i.e. certain co-texts tend to result in certain readings. In terms of interpreting CRs, age does not turn out to play a role. It does play a role, however, in the likelihood of participants using these constructions, as older participants tend to consider it less likely that they would. Finally, gender does not play a role in the interpretation nor in the likelihood of participants using the CR examples.","['contrastive focus reduplication, morphology, sociolinguistics, receptivity']"

"Rebels for peace or a peace for rebels? A research about the local significance of the Pacification of Ghent in Utrecht, 1576-1581.","Mc Cann, Damien",['Prof. J.S. Pollmann'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,This research is about the local significance of the Pacification of Ghent in Utrecht between 1576 and 1581. It argues that the Pacification was the crucial treaty for the participation of the States and city of Utrecht in the Dutch Revolt because of its lack of coherency and clarity. This thesis explores the competing narratives about the meaning of this peace. The analysis focusses on the interests of different groups in city and the reinterpretations of the peace terms in the Pacification within the rapidly developing circumstances of the Dutch Revolt. The main argument is that the act of oblivion in the Pacification was the tacit driving force behind the competition of narratives about legitimacy. The Pacification successfully offered a tabula rasa for the previous decade and became the most important reference for peace negotiation between 1576 and 1581. The “originalist” narrative tried to stay with the Pacification terms as intended when it was signed in 1576; the “clarifying” narrative argued that the cherry-picked peace violations of the royal party – together with the changed circumstances – necessitated an elaboration of the original peace treaty; the “abnegation” narrative used these cherry-picked peace violations of the royal party to highlight the obsolesce of the treaty and framed the treaty’s failure as a reason to abjure king Philip. This last narrative flipped the Pacification on its head; the new continuity with the present was not based on the treaty’s terms but on its violation and frame of belonging to the past.,"['Pacification of Ghent', 'Utrecht', 'Dutch Revolt', 'Peace making', 'Peace keeping', 'Peace', 'Act of Oblivion', 'Amnesty', 'Transitional Justice', 'Discourses of Peace', 'William of Orange', 'Eighty Years War', 'Reformation', 'Religious violence', 'Religious peace', 'John of Nassau', 'Siege of Vredenburg', 'Satisfaction of Utrecht', 'Religious peace of Utrecht', 'Union of Utrecht', 'Civil war', 'Exiles', 'Political reintegration', 'Protestant', 'Catholic', '1576', '1577', '1578', '1579', '1580', '1581', 'Act of Abjuration', 'Don John of Austria', 'civic militia', 'iconoclasm', 'religious tolerance', 'council of troubles', 'heresy', 'rebellion', 'civic peace', 'language of peace', 'peace treaty', 'peace negotiations', 'Pacificatie van Gent', 'Nederlandse Opstand', 'Tachtigjarige Oorlog', 'Willem van Oranje', 'Jan van Nassau', 'Don Johan', 'vredesverdrag', 'vredesonderhandelingen', 'Beleg van Vredenburg', 'Satisfactie van Utrecht', 'Unie van Utrecht', 'beeldenstorm']"

Crisis or Opportunity? How the Jordan Compact reinforces the commodification of forced displacement,"Molen, Frederieke van der","['Valadbaygi, K.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2016, the Jordan Compact (JC) agreement brought together the government of Jordan and major international donors to pledge support to Syrian refugees. It represented a new form of refugee management that incorporates humanitarian help and long-term national development objectives. This thesis analysed how the JC is much more than a humanitarian project and led to the commodification of refugees. To answer this question, a historical analysis of the neoliberal restructuring in Jordan and a critical discourse analysis of the JC was conducted, using a neo-Marxist framework. The results show that a new humanitarian-development paradigm increasingly renders refugees as resilient objects of economic opportunity, leading to their exploitation in the labour market, and serves as a legitimising mechanism for the continuation and deepening of neoliberal restructuring. This study emphasises that humanitarian projects are inherently political and never neutral, and that while “turning the Syrian refugee crisis into a development opportunity” may sound like an appealing proposition, the conjunction of development and humanitarianism proves not to be compatible, as it leads to the exploitation and commodification of refugees in a newly emerged realm of capital accumulation.","['Jordan Compact', 'humanitarian-development nexus', 'neoliberalisation', 'Marxism', 'refugee commodification']"

How has Euroscepticism developed in the 2 years leading up to Brexit? A local analysis,"Kolsteren, Timothy","['Broad, M.', 'Augusteijn, J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since the referendum in 2016, Brexit has had an undeniable effect on the International relations scene, showing that not all countries invite globalisation, in what is a rapidly globalising world. The decision has been researched to a large extent already, but what most dominant literature debating the topic of Brexit currently neglects, is understanding local causes and reasons for this outcome. Whilst it has been sufficient thus far to categorize reasons into wider meta narratives, this thesis instead aims to take a different scope and understand what has happened at a local level to uncover why the British public came to this conclusion. This will be done by analysing data from local counties, with a focus on two counties in particular: Lincolnshire and Essex. These two regions were some of the most pro-Brexit out of the whole of the United Kingdom it came to show, but this thesis looks to understand how and why, in order to produce differing conclusions to compare to one another. This is with the aim to prove that local level needs to be looked at instead of meta narratives, which we see for example in the current domination discourse of culturally left behind vs socioeconomic reasons. By comparing these contrasting reasons, my thesis hopes to help us understand something beyond public opinion surveys and understand different streams of opinion which may have made up the Brexit coalition, and bring light to a new method of analysing causes of Brexit. In a time where major International organisations such as the European Union aim to delegate more power to local communities, this new method of analysis can help understand where improvements to communication and power can be made on a local scale.","['Europe, Brexit']"

An exploration into a quantitative methodology for comparative semantic analysis.,"Reijnaers, Damiaan","['Fortuin, E.L.J.', 'Schaeken, J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis builds on the idea that subtle, culturally induced differences in semantic meaning remain between translation equivalent words across different languages. This study further argues that these differences in meaning may be approached through the examination of the linguistic contexts within which these words occur. Consequently, this work provides a quantitative methodology for highlighting relevant areas in which such cultural differences may be reflected. The method is based on intuition derived from several existing, structuralist methods and works primarily by comparing the frequency of hypernyms of nouns that appear in the neighborhood of an examined word. This thesis focuses on the indigenous Dolgan language as a case study; one that is purposely exploratory in nature. This minority language poses the research with the additional challenge of working with a small-sized language corpus for computational purposes: it demands a ‘rough’ look at data to act as a means, instead of being a limitation. Overall, the results indicate that culturally determined differences between words exist to a measurable degree, despite the unavailability of an adequately sized dataset. Although the results provide insufficient guidance for drawing anthropological conclusions, the findings reassert that cultural knowledge is encoded within language and reiterate the need to preserve endangered indigenous languages.","['Dolgan', 'semantic analysis', 'Russian', 'indigenous peoples', 'Siberia', 'computational linguistics', 'semantics', 'contextual analysis', 'corpus linguistics', 'linguistic relativity']"

To Resist Is To Exist: Using visual art as a form of creative resistance in the conflict over Western Sahara,"Geertsema, Femke",['Amza Adam'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In what is considered Africa’s last colony, several artists have recognized the potential of creative resistance to achieve social change for the Saharawi people indigenous to the territory of Western Sahara. Several Saharawi activists have resorted to non-violent methods to resist Morocco’s occupation and cultivate solidarity in their fight for independence and self-determination of the Saharawi people. This research seeks to complement available literature existing on Saharawi resistance by looking at the works of Saharawi visual artists as methods of creative resistance in the conflict over Western Sahara. By critically analysing available literature on creative resistance, artivism, transnational activism, engaging in different visual artworks and by using narrative interview as a method, this research aimed to understand how Saharawi activists use visual arts as a method of creative resistance to renegotiate identity, challenge prevailing power relations, and generate international awareness of the struggle for the independence and self-determination of Western Sahara. This thesis identified the use of visual art as a way to facilitate social change in the Western Sahara conflict as it grants the Saharawi people the capacity to preserve their identity in the face of cultural genocide, challenge Morocco’s occupation in tactful and effective ways, and mobilize transnational activism. This study could inspire future studies on pro-peaceful narratives to resistance, activism, and social change in conflicts and contexts that involve similar power dynamics.","['Western Sahara Conflict, Creative resistance, Saharawi Resistance, National Identity, Artivism, Transnational Activism']"

Changing Demographics and Changing Perspectives in China: A comparative analysis of Chinese and Japanese demographic trends and policy,"Lange, Matthias van","['Teh, L.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The main cause of birth-rate decline, in any country as well as China, is due to natural changes in socio-economic factors, such as the labour market, prospects of financial stability, the housing market, the marriage market, a work-life balance, urbanization, affordable childcare and education of both men and women. The one-child policy might have assisted a fast-track through the stages of demographic transition, but the main reason for the current continuation of low fertility is caused by these socio-economic factors. To prove the legitimacy of this argument, even though there were no birth control policies set in place in Japan since the end of the Second World War, fertility still declined due to similar socio-economic circumstances as in China today. However, after Japanese policy makers started addressing some of the socio-economic factors, birth rates did ever so slightly improve since the low in 2005, further showing evidence of the importance of these determining factors. The argument that will be used in this paper to answer the research question “Why did Chinese policymakers drop the one-child policy and how effective is this policy move in reversing the demographic trends?” is as follows: The one-child policy was fully dropped as policy makers finally realized, while too late due to the opaqueness of the Chinese government, that the fertility rates were socially and economically unsustainable. The effect of the implemented policies in reversing the demographic trend is weak because the socio-economic factors which determine continuous low fertility are not addressed.","['Demography', 'China', 'One-child policy', 'Japan', 'Demographics', 'Three-child policy', 'aging population', 'fertility rate', 'birth rate']"

Parafita Couto'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This study investigates Family Language Policy (FLP) in Greek-Finnish families living in Greece and the language management methods in use in these families. Additionally, the study examines what kinds of factors influence the FLP in the families under study, if any. The research is mainly guided by Spolsky’s (2004) three-tiered language policy model: language practices, language beliefs or ideology and efforts to modify said practices through language management. The target group for this research are Greek-Finnish families living in Greece, in which at least one parent is of Finnish heritage and speaks Finnish. The research was conducted through two separate online surveys: one was intended for the Finnish-speaking parents and one for their offspring, respectively. The survey inquired about the FLP in the families through questions related to the Finnish language and culture, including multiple choice questions and open-ended questions with an option to respond with text or audio. The results showed that the one-parent-one-language (OPOL) method was commonly in use in the families. A high impact belief, which refers to the parental belief about control over their children’s language skills (De Houwer 1999), and a strong ethnocultural identity were seen as factors affecting the FLP in a positive way. This means that the family members’ attitudes are in favor of learning the heritage language and passing it on to the next generation. Some external factors to the family, such as pressure from the Greek-speaking majority community, had a negative influence on family language policy, which could manifest for example as a resistance for passing on the home language. This study contributed to a better understanding of multilingual family life and FLP in families in which two small languages, Finnish and Greek, are spoken. These languages are not often studied in tandem. Future research could focus on child agency in such families in order to understand better the role children play in maintaining the heritage language in a family.","['Family Language Policy, FLP, OPOL, language management, heritage language, multilingual families, bilingualism, Finnish, Greek']"

Human rights advocacy and the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games,"Moullet, Benoît","['Gerrits, A']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study aims at showing how human rights activists used the Olympic platform to advocate for human rights issues in China and what the consequences of this activism were. Through a qualitative case study of the 2022 Olympic Games, using document and discourse analysis, it analyses the interactions of this activism with several actors of the platform, such as the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Olympic sponsors, governments and the Chinese authorities. The results of the research show that human rights activism led in recent years to an increase in importance of human rights issues in the realm of the Olympics through the evolution of the IOC’s human rights approach and governmental action. However, the 2022 Olympics highlighted the IOC’s difficult position, torn between its neutral political stance and human rights issues, which left human rights activists disappointed again. Furthermore, China’s response to these political actions proved to be in stark opposition to the Western narrative and might indicate an even further antagonism between the different conceptions of human rights.",
Forces-for-status: The Netherlands’ Contribution to the International Security Assistance Force (2006-2010),"Oostdam, Laura","['Gawthorpe, A.J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Contrary to the predictions set out in traditional realist literature, small European states have made sizeable military contributions and demonstrated significant risk-willingness in US- and NATO-led missions in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria. The small state literature has cautiously recognized status as an important explanatory factor of such disproportionate contributions. So far, however, it has hardly been explored how status motivations lead to contribution outcomes. Building on these recent advances, this thesis aims to deepen the understanding of the drivers behind status-seeking. Using the case of the Netherlands’ contribution to ISAF, Task Force Uruzgan (2006-2010), this research demonstrates how small state contributions can be the result of an assessment of potential non-material gains in the form of reputation and status, as well as concerns surrounding the loss of these benefits. This differs from current knowledge, as it suggests that small states are driven by more than just ‘positive’ status incitements.",
"China, the US, and R2P: Waxing or Waning Legitimacy? Examining China’s Conception of Sovereignty and the Responsibility to Protect in the Face of a Declining United States","Pogue, Griffin","['Dr. Regilme, S.S.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the prevalence of a US decline in China's perception of the Responsibility to Protect. After exploring debates surrounding a decline in US hegemonic power and establishing China's traditional conception of R2P in contrast to Western interpretations, this thesis treats the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq as a turning point in US foreign policy legitimacy. Three potential arguments to this question align with conceptions on the future of rising powers and the stability of the international order (balance, spoiler, and cooptation). Conducting a qualitative content analysis of China's language in the UN Security Council and General Assembly on the early stages of Iraq, the 2011 Libyan intervention, and the Syrian Civil War reveals China has not altered its domestic interpretation of R2P, but has grown increasingly confident in expressing that interpretation in the United Nations as the wound to the United States' legitimacy as the champion of the global order has continued to worsen.","['China, Responsibility to Protect, Security Council, contestation, international order, US decline, Iraq, Syria, Libya']"

The Legitimacy Debate in EU Member States: A Case Study of The Netherlands,"Andel, Bente van",['M.E.L. David'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The economic and financial crisis, Brexit, mass migration, the claim to more sovereignty and the undermining of the fundamental values and the rule of law by some Member States (MS) has led to political unrest within the European Union (EU) in recent years. This has become reason for some political movements (the so-called Eurosceptics) in European countries to question the legitimacy of the EU and to push for more sovereignty for MS and even striving for an EU departure. The question arises whether MS in the EU are substantively questioning the legitimacy of the EU and whether this legitimacy issue is a well-founded topic of discussion in the political debate. This study examines that question by focussing on the case study of the Netherlands and highlights the political developments in the Netherlands regarding the legitimacy of the EU. Regarding the legitimacy of the EU, research was conducted over the period 2009 – 2022 also referred to as the post-Lisbon era. The party programs (2012, 2017 and 2021) of 6 political parties, the debates in the Dutch parliament and the coalition agreements (2012, 2017 and 2022) were studied on topics related to legitimacy of the EU. These categories include, compliance (transparency, compliance with agreements and financial controls), problem-solving capacity (the extent to which and which problems must be solved at European level) and justification (sovereignty and the subsidiarity principle). It is registered which subjects are mentioned and what the position is. The results have been analysed according to the mixed content method. It was concluded that that over time, the debate of legitimacy evolved, and political parties became more critical of the EU’s transparency and democratic legitimacy. At the same time, most parties remained pro-EU and realised that in the problem-solving category, this is with most larger problems only solvable at EU level. In conclusion, from an EU perspective, the developments in the Netherlands are surprisingly positive. Although Dutch politicians remain critical of the decision-making process and the lack of transparency, the believe that staying in the EU is the most positive for the Netherlands is still viable with the majority of the Dutch parliament. This is ultimately positive for the future of the EU.","['Legitimacy', 'EU', 'Populism', 'Democratic Deficit', 'Transparency']"
The Role of Foreign Intelligence Agencies in Cold War Coups d'État: A Comparative Case Study of Iran and Afghanistan,"Loufir, Marius","['Yenen, A.A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Intelligence agencies have been traditionally depicted as rogue elements within the state apparatus. In this thesis, I assess the validity of this alleged independent agency during the ‘Golden Age’ of convert operations: the Cold War. Throughout the said period, more subversive and clandestine activities became the norm instead of the erstwhile use of direct military force. The two most active Intelligence Agencies of the period, the CIA and the KGB were key actors in supporting and executing government overthrows mostly throughout the Third World. The two case studies I examine are the CIA coup against the Mohammed Mossadegh government in Iran in 1953 and the KGB overthrow of Hafizullah Amin in Afghanistan in 1979. However, my concern is not only the agencies’ role in carrying out the coups d’état but how they influenced the decision-making process within their foreign policy making bodies (the US National Security Council and the Soviet Politburo) to make these coups happen in the first place. By using the Bureaucratic Politics paradigm and other theoretical tools regarding the execution of coups d’état I underline how these intelligence agencies not only carried them but also were the main agents provocateurs behind the decision to intervene.","['Cold War History', 'Clandestine Operations', 'CIA', 'KGB', 'Iran', 'Afghanistan', 'Bureaucratic Politics']"

The Translation of Historical Experience: Johan Huizinga’s Herfsttij der Middeleeuwen,"Wouterse, Myrte",['Dr. M. S. Newton'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"When we read a book of history, we produce a mental image of the past we read about. That mental image is informed by the text. Sometimes, when we read a book of history, the text is so vivid, the descriptions so penetrating, that we are left with more than an image: emotion, thought, realisation. The text has affected us. This act of communication, the communication of ‘historical experience,' is the focus point of this thesis. To explore this fascinating concept, the main case study is Johan Huizinga's Herfsttij der Middeleeuwen. The choice for this work is twofold: one, Johan Huizinga is the first person to introduce the concept of historical experience, which he called historische sensatie; two, Herfsttij der Middeleeuwen is a work of history known for its affective use of language. Focussing on those textual elements that drive historical experience, this paper will explore how Herfsttij der Middeleeuwen is able to convey this affect of the (imagined) past. Further, the Dutch source text will be compared to the three English translations to see how historical experience transfers in a translation process.","['historische sensatie', 'Johan Huizinga', 'translation studies', 'affect']"

I will discuss the legal system of the Netherlands with the help of various legal scholarly sources and other descriptive sources. By situating the uniquely system-bound language of the prosecution of financial crime in the Netherlands within Dutch legal language, I uncover the challenges of producing an English language terminology for this particular subfield. The subfield, which touches on multiple areas of law and policy and is regulated by multiple institutions, results from governments’ and supranational organizations’ increased attention for crimes with a significant financial component and high societal impact in recent years. By giving an overview of the field of translation studies – and in particular theory of legal translation – such as theories by Deborah Cao and Susan Šarčević I will provide a foundation for overcoming terminological and translation challenges. My proposed methodology suggests an approach to translating Dutch legal terminology which consists of presenting micro-evaluation and macro-evaluation of concepts, assessing both conceptual relations and origins, and illustrating the found relations and definitions in the end product.","['linguistics', 'law', 'translation studies', 'terminology', 'legal translation', 'Dutch fiscal law', 'Dutch criminal law', 'financial crime', 'bilingual terminology']"
NEOLIBERALIZING COMMUNITIES: Safari Tourism’s Implications for Local Livelihoods in Tanzania,"Feil, Verena",['Dr. A.M. van der Wal-Remy'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Tourism is a major economic sector in Tanzania, where safari tourism provides great financial revenue. The impacts of safari tourism on local people and ecosystems are crucial to investigate, especially with only eight years left to fulfil the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations. As an increasing number of tourists wants to travel sustainably, it is necessary to examine how tourism affects local communities in Tanzania. Hence, this paper provides a qualitative analysis of two safari tourism operators with a claim to being sustainable, Thomson Safaris and Matriarch Africa, to showcase how their initiatives impact local livelihoods. The findings demonstrate the way in which the tourism businesses improve the security of local livelihoods by providing microfinance, hunger relief, educational, and health services. Such initiatives enhance the realization of the 2030 Agenda as they coincide with the Sustainable Development Goals. However, the research also identifies flaws in sustainable tourism initiatives such as restricted land access necessary for some people to maintain themselves, greenwashing of tourists into believing that their vacation is beneficial to locals while the efforts of the operator may be rather poor, and the neoliberalization of local communities that coincides with tourism initiatives.",

Towards National Rejuvenation and Chinese inherent Peacefulness: A case study of Great Power Diplomacy,"Bong, Jade",['Dr. Vincent Chang'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"China’s national identity plays a crucial role in the research of Chinese nationalism security and historical memory making. Identity politics played an increasingly important role in China, especially after the reform and opening up of the Chinese economy initiated by Deng Xiaoping and the 1989 Tiananmen crisis. The CCP’s moral and ideological legitimacy was increasingly challenged. Deng and Jiang Zemin turned to patriotic education and Confucianism for the solution, citing the lack of patriotic feelings among citizen as the cause for the Tiananmen crisis (Gilley 1998, 271-2). The selective and “active forgetting” nature of writing history is also present in the construction of national identity and political discourse which are dependent on elites and their political aims (Renwick & Qing 1999, 112). Under Xi’s rule, the national identity discourse has taken a shift in narratives, where nationalism humiliation faded slowly into the background and gradually replaced by more ambitious and victorious narratives (Chang 2021). The motivation behind this shift can be shortly summarise as CCP’s historical goals of “great rejuvenation of the nation” which Xi explicitly expressed since his succession. The construction of national identity involves selecting specific historical events as strong evidence for themes, even though it might ignore or exclude the complete picture, especially in China, where the historical discourse is highly politicalised (Zhao 2015). Therefore, this paper is interested in “How does China constructs its national identity discourse around the themes of ‘The China Dream’ and ‘Chinese inherent peacefulness’”? The documentary Great Power Diplomacy will be used as a case study in answering this 2 question. It is argued that the CCP has carefully constructed a framework in integrating themes of “China Dream” and “Chinese inherent peacefulness” into the Chinese national discourse through propaganda, while the constructed discourse also serves as a useful tool in deflecting criticism.","['China', 'Chinese national Identity', 'National identity discourse', 'discourse analysis', 'Great Power Diplomacy']"

Payments for Ecosystem Services in the Ecuadorian highlands: Reshaping the governance of natural resources and negotiating rural-urban identities: The cases of FONAG and Socio Bosque,"Mayora Barcenas, Milena",['Dr. Edmund Amann'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) are financial incentives provided to rural communities on the condition that they modify their agricultural practices to limit their ecological impact and supply environmental goods purchased by a group of beneficiaries. In Ecuador, PES schemes have continued to be implemented in the paramo highlands from the early 2000s to the present as part of a global, neoliberal wave in environmental governance, which has fostered the idea that economic valuation is the key for addressing environmental externalities. While PES have been conceptualised as instruments for inclusive development because monetary transfers can positively impact poverty alleviation, their control by more powerful investors calls for a consideration of the extent to which their governance arrangements truly enable benefits to be distributed fairly between services providers and consumers. Therefore, adopting a political ecology theoretical lense, this paper will analyse how the implementation of PES schemes as tools for addressing environmental externalities has impacted social relations and the governance of natural resources in the Ecuadorian highlands from the early 2000s to the present. Focusing on two PES programs from Ecuador, FONAG and Socio Bosque, it will argue that power asymmetries between rural communities and service buyers have enabled the latter to increasingly gain control over resource governance. By analysing their impact on ownership regimes, neoliberal conceptualisations on environmental management, and social relations at the community level, the paper will conclude that PES schemes reproduce the political, cultural and socio-economic divide between urban and rural centres. As such, it will contribute to the academic literature by highlighting the mechanisms through which these programs reinforce rural communities’ marginalised position in Ecuadorian society.","['Payments for Ecosystem Services', 'Political Ecology', 'Centre-Periphery Relations', 'Neoliberal Governmentalities', 'Environmental Externalities', 'Resource Governance', 'Economic Incentives', 'Property Rights Regimes', 'Techno-Fix.']"

In doing this, it will be attempted to conclude what exactly it is to be a coercer within the spheres of global climate policy and how a coercer can be justified, or perceive itself to be justified, in violating the sovereignty of a target state of coercion. As part of this analysis, it must furthermore be discussed what it exactly is to be a sovereign within the confines of the modern world, which is more interconnected and interdependent than hitherto seen before, and how it relates to acts of coercion. It is only after discussing these concepts separately that they can be compared and analysed how they interact within the confines of global issues such as climate change. This dissertation will conclude that justifications for coercive behaviour only arise for those in violation of IEA’s to which have been consented, those in violation of obligations towards human rights and the climate, and in certain context-specific situations which may vary in outcome. It will furthermore be concluded that coercive behaviour within climate policy may even be undesirable, as the effectiveness of IEA’s is dependent on the number of states engaging in co-operative action, consenting out of their own free will.","['Climate Policy, Coercion, Sovereignty, global climate policy, International Environmental Agreements,']"

The 2016 primary elections in the United States have been filled with controversies and interesting peculiarities, they ignited and divided the general public's opinion, especially on social media, while highlighting many dysfunctional aspects of the American political system. As a matter of fact, during the 2016 electoral campaign, social networks have proven to be a powerful tool that connects people, by providing them with the possibility to interact with one another, to share their pride and political views and most importantly, to share their opinions. In an increasingly interconnected and technologically developed political landscape it becomes extremely relevant to shine some light on the dynamics behind the social media strategies of the 2016 primary elections, which saw the main candidates, for the first time and more than ever, involved with social media scandals, fake news, fact-checking, cyber-attacks and FBI investigations. As a result, an investigation of the social media strategies of the 2016 primaries is a relevant issue to explore, as social media has grown increasingly influential in many aspects of political participation. Furthermore, the focus of this research is not solely going to be restricted to determine the presence of particular social media strategies during the 2016 primaries, but rather to identify how they encouraged voter engagement.","['United States, political communication strategies, primaries 2016, political participation, social media']"

Given the international importance of Italy’s oil Neo-Atlanticism in the Soviet Union, as well as the academic debate concerning other factors shaping US-Italian early Cold War relations, it is relevant to understand the extent to which this element affected ties between Rome and Washington. On this note, this study will address the following (sub)question(s): How did Italy’s Neo-Atlanticist oil policy toward the USSR influence US-Italian Cold War relations between 1958 and 1963? What was the importance of the Italian oil agenda in the Soviet bloc within the wider systemic Cold War? An answer will be provided based on a qualitative assessment of two core episodes of Italian oil expansionism, namely the 1960 ENI-SNE barter agreement and the Druzhba pipeline project. Such thematic will be investigated in a decentralized Cold War system, applying Italy’s perspective of the conflict. The conclusions reached are that Italian oil Neo-Atlanticism made the US drift apart from Italy. Furthermore, through its assertive oil agenda, Italy proved its agency in the international system by (1) partnering with the USSR when convenient whilst remaining in the Western Alliance, and (2) contributing to triggering a brief period of relaxation between the two superpowers.","['Cold War', 'US-Italian relations', 'oil policy', 'Italian Neo-Atlanticism', 'ENI-SNE barter agreement', 'Druzhba pipeline']"

How Code-Switching Informs Syntactic Theory: Insights from Nominal Ellipsis and Adjacency in Belgian Dutch/French,"Delbar, Natasja","['Parafita Couto, M.C.', 'Lipták, A.K.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Discussions concerning syntactic aspects of code-switching (CS) phenomena are currently ongoing. This thesis looks at two such phenomena, nominal ellipsis (NPE) and linear adjacency, and shows how empirical investigation of CS contexts helps inform linguistic theory. This was accomplished by presenting 23 Belgian Dutch/French (BD/FR) bilinguals with a two-alternative forced choice judgment task and comparing their choices through t-tests to check for significance. Experiment 1 examines whether the choice of grammatical gender on adnominal ellipsis remnants reveals a morphosyntactic link between a FR elided noun with a BD antecedent. The results show that no such link can be observed for NPE in this language pair; this is contra González-Vilbazo and Ramos (2015), Merchant (2015) and Nee (2012), who have found evidence of a such a link between elided elements and antecedent in code-switched clausal and VP-ellipsis, as well as general evidence against structural theories of ellipsis (e.g., Merchant, 2001; 2004). Experiment 2 explores the Matrix Language Framework (MLF) (Myers-Scotton, 1993; 1995), a popular model that predicts that the determiner language will match the matrix language (ML) in code-switched DPs. However, effects of linear adjacency between the determiner and the inflection on the main verb (which determines the ML) have not yet been considered within the MLF. The DP was given as a post-verbal complement (adjacent), and as a post-verbal adjunct and a pre-verbal complement (non-adjacent). The results show that linear adjacency has no effect on determiner language. Moreover, the results also do not fit into the MLF. This thesis is the first empirical study to examine NPE theory in a code-switched environment, as well as the first to investigate linear adjacency effects on code-switched DPs. This work also provides insight into CS patterns in the BD/FR language pair, a relatively understudied bilingual population that frequently employs CS but is not a close-knit community. Taken together, these findings show that gathering empirical CS data from distinct bilingual populations is crucial, adding new and contrary insights and aiding the construction of linguistic theory.","['code-switching', 'French', 'Belgian Dutch', 'nominal ellipsis', 'gender', 'linear adjacency', 'determiner language', 'two-alternative forced choice task']"

"Kafala, from Modern Roots until Reform: A look at Bahrain's labour migration regime and the fundamental obstacles to change","Reitsma, Anna-Lotte","['Ennis, C.A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis traces the development of the kafala system in Bahrain from its modern origins in the British protectorate era until its reform in the first and second decade of the twenty-first century. It conducts a historical analysis based on archival evidence to elucidate the intricate interlocking of this trajectory with multiscalar, overlapping, and often competing social, economic, and political transformations. Material incentives, as well as domestic and regional political pressures, played a key role in this formulation. The history uncovered sheds important light on the critical shortcomings of recent reforms to Bahrain’s labour migration regime and the fundamental obstructions to change. It demonstrates that the persistent vulnerability of migrant workers under contemporary structures of kafala is inextricably linked to the workings of the global economy under the capitalist mode of production. Privileging this interconnection as the vantage point from which to consider labour migration regimes in the Gulf is crucial if we are to understand and assess the challenges to and opportunities for change.","['kafala', 'Bahrain', 'labour migration', 'migration', 'social history', 'historical analysis']"

"""No somos ni hombres, ni mujeres."" An analysis of muxe representation in Mexican tweets on the intersection of postcolonialism and trans linguistics","Oosterink, Emma","['Alves Vieira, Eduardo']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Previous studies suggested that Spanish colonisers imposed their northern-based beliefs and ideas, including the Christian religion and cisnormativity, on their occupied territories under colonial rule. This thesis aims to determine whether colonial legacies still influence the perceptions among present-day Mexican Twitter users. Specifically, it addresses the ways in which the muxe, a third gender among the Zapotec community, are perceived. To test the hypothesis, 112 tweets, including 37 visual objects, were examined using a mixed-methods approach. All tweets were written in Spanish and published between January 1, 2021, and April 30, 2022. The sample (n=112) has been coded and analysed with the software program ATLAS.ti. The results showed that the majority (59.82%) of the authors demonstrated cisnormativity by misgendering the muxe, and little more than one-fifth (20.54%) exercised epistemological colonisation through the misusage of northern-based terminology. Correspondingly, 40.18% of the authors correctly adopted non-biased muxe descriptions, such as third gender. Interestingly, three of the six videos explicitly touched upon how colonialism altered Mexican attitudes towards the muxe. Considering previous literature, the results of this thesis suggest that colonial legacies affect to some extent the ways in which contemporary Mexican Twitter users perceive muxes as gender identity. However, since the results demonstrated no definitive agreement, no firm conclusion can be drawn about the hypothesis. By applying statistics, further research might be conducted to confirm the significance of these results.","['trans linguistics', 'third gender', 'non-normative gender', 'colonial discourse', 'postcolonialism', 'Zapotec', 'muxe', 'mixed methods', 'Twitter']"
