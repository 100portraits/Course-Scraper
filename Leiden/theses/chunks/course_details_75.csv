Integration of the Chinese-Dutch Second Generation in the Netherlands,"Lyu, Jiayu","['Bouras, Nadia']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"For a long time, the second-generation Chinese immigrants have been perceived as the “shining model” of what immigrant families should be like by many western countries, with the highest education backgrounds and economic well-being. Do they know they are perceived as the model for ethnic minority groups in this country? Do they agree with this comment? In this paper, I am going to explore the answer to the question: how does the second generation Dutch Chinese perceive themselves in relation to the shining example myth. My thesis statement is that misunderstood the meaning of ‘integration’, this discourse creates a problematic illusion of the Chinese immigrants as being a ‘shining model’ solely based on their public stereotypes and achievements in terms of socio-economic status. The myth contributes to the ignorance of their social exclusion and to the confusion encountered during the acculturation process. It rationalises establishing an assimilationist migration policy of omitting the issues of providing assistance with regards to developing their own ethnic culture while adapting to mainstream society. It alienates the second generation Chinese-Dutch as an ethnic minority group by unrecognising their demands for further integrating to both cultures since they are regarded as already ‘perfectly integrated’ by the public.","['Second-generation Chinese Dutch', 'Model Minority Myth']"

Flexible vs Mandatory Solidarity and the 2015 Refugee Relocation Mechanism,"Francisco, Ines","['Steen, Bart van der']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Whilst the principle of European solidarity has been promoted as one of the key parts of European identity, it remains a debated topic, due to the implications it has for Member States, for example in terms of giving up sovereignty. The prospect of European integration at different speeds has been seen in a negative light by the European Union, despite there being significant historical and structural differences amongst the Member States, which have not been resolved through EU membership. During the 2015 refugee crisis, solidarity became a hot topic once again, due to the overburden experienced in the arrival Member States of Greece and Italy. However, despite being a frequently evoked term, only the mandatory aspect of solidarity has been defined by the EU, who shuns the idea of a flexible solidarity. Whilst refusing the xenophobic ideals of the countries behind this new perception of solidarity, this thesis engages in a critique of the concept of mandatory solidarity, in light of different historical pasts, and experience with migration across Member States.","['solidarity', 'Poland', 'Hungary', 'refugee crisis', 'refugee relocation mechanism', 'variable geometry Europe']"
Counterhegemonic Forms of Justice: The Potential of Permanent Peoples Tribunal in the Context of Resource - based Conflicts and Human Rights Violations in Guatemala,"Reiß, Mia Katharina","['Alves Vieira, Eduardo']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis is about the confrontation between two forms of justice. One institutionalized as law, and the other, depending on situational embodied forms of doing justice. Further, it is about the confrontation between sources of law. One source relates to sovereign nation states as top down mechanism, and the other, to indigenous peoples as bottom-up process. The analysis applies a bottom-up approach, as suggested by decolonial critical thought, that questions elemental assumptions about dominant neoliberal institutional frameworks. This thesis cannot solve these tensions. It tries to investigate their dynamics on the basis of a specific case, which is, the ethical tribunal, established by Maya Mam indigenous peoples in 2012, that accuses the Canadian mining company Goldcorp for committing human rights violations through its extractive activities in the area of San Marcus Ixtahuacán, Guatemala. Instead of coming up with a solution, the thesis wants to question dominant legal frameworks that permit human rights violations and reveal the capacity of informal legal compositions to install grounds of justice. It was identified that the ethical tribunal contributed to unfold the seemingly uncontested nature of neoliberal extractive activities through its potential to challenge impunity and establish access to cognitive, and epistemic forms of justice.","['Globalization', 'Resource - Based Conflicts', 'Ethical Tribunals', 'Law', 'Bottom - Up Approach', 'Maya Mam Community', 'Guatemala', 'Human Rights.']"

The Resurgence of Religion in 'New' Terrorism: A Comparative Analysis of the IRA and Al-Qaeda,"Dekker, Rachel","['Bruijn, Petra De']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"There has been a substantial shift in recent decades towards the ‘new’ terrorism paradigm, and with it a shift by academics, policymakers and counter-terrorism experts on the conception of the modern threat that terrorist organizations pose and the ways to counter them.1 The new terrorism paradigm suggests that we have seen the rise of radical religious terrorist organizations, such as Al-Qaeda, from the 1990s onward, and that somehow these organizations pose a greater threat to our security than previous terrorist organizations, as they have no clear objective and merely wish for destruction in the name of religion. Through the analysis of two case studies, that of the IRA and Al-Qaeda, and the focus on national vs. transnational natures, as well as secular and religious motivations, the research will be able to suggest whether we are indeed seeing a ‘new wave’ of terrorism in modern times, and may lead to a more sound base for the ‘new’ terrorism claim as well as shift conceptions of policy makers and academics on counter-terrorism strategies and conceptions of the modern day threat of terrorism. The IRA has been chosen as a famous example of a nationalist terrorist organization from the 1970s, and will thus be used to test the old terrorism category, whereas Al-Qaeda has been selected as the first transnational religious terrorist organization which emerged in the 1990s as a test of the ‘new’ terrorism category. The comparative analysis of the two case studies will ultimately prove whether or not ‘new wave’ terrorism and its emphasis on religion as a main feature is justified and will then push forward a new way of conceiving of terrorism. Firstly, it is important to understand the different paradigms of terrorism (i.e. old vs. new), these will be discussed in the state of the art. Chapter 1 and 2 will focus on the case studies of the IRA and Al-Qaeda, after which chapter 3 will contrast and compare the outcomes of these case studies and will make a preliminary categorization of the organizations. Chapter 4 will delve into the issue of religion in ‘new’ terrorism and will explain how Islam has become a prominent religious motivation and justification in recent years for radical Islamist groups such as Al-Qaeda. Finally, a conclusion will be made on the justification of the theory proposed by Rapoport, and the categorizations of the IRA and Al-Qaeda.","['Terrorism studies', 'new terrorism theory', 'new wave theory', 'religion', 'IRA', 'Al-Qaeda']"

Middle Powermanship in Egypt’s Foreign Policy: The Case of the Syrian Civil War,"Doykov, Mario","['Ennis, Crystal']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper seeks to understand the determinants and limitations of Egypt’s foreign policy approach towards the Syrian civil war. The chosen theoretical framework seeks to situate Egypt within the debate on the concept of Middle Powers. While Egypt lacks economic power, it still perceives itself as a Middle Power and acts as such due to its ambitions, and large military capabilities. In the first empirical chapter it is found that Egypt’s historical legacy has embedded the notions of independence, external economic assistance and counter-Islamism in its foreign policy. In the second empirical chapter, the interests of Sisi’s government were identified as matching the historical constants of Egypt’s foreign policy, which also explains his support for Assad. Then, it was found that Egypt’s interests are conflicting with those of its main allies and donors – the United States (US), Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but are rather convergent with the interests of Russia and China. Therefore, Egypt cannot overly support the Assad regime in Syria as this would potentially lead to a loss of needed financial aid.","['Middle Power', 'Egypt', 'Sisi', 'Foreign Policy', 'Syrian Civil War']"

Influencing Climate Change: Framing the Story of Climate Change as a Social Problem in American Documentaries,"Parra Perez, Etienne Ramiro Jen Kong","['Nie, Yuxi']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The general scientific consensus is that climate change is a significant issue due to human activity. However, from a social problems perspective, climate change is only significant if people think it is. Hence, the way their perception is influenced determines the urgency to solve it. This research examines how American documentaries attempt to influence this perception through the narrative of their story. The case studies are selected based on their popularity, commercial success and unique perspective. Framing analysis is applied to categorise the arguments. The sequence protocol prepares the film material for analysis. Modes of documentary filmmaking is used to examine the style of presentation. Each method is applied in a separate viewing, resulting in three analytical viewings for each film. The results show that American documentaries present climate change as urgent with potential disastrous consequences. ​An Inconvenient Truth: A Global Warning(AIT, 2006) emphasises the responsibility of government and each individual citizen. ​Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret(CWS, 2014) ​emphasises the lack of transparency in government and environmental organisations. ​Before the Flood(BTF, 2016) emphasises how consumer behaviour and a carbon tax can solve the problem. The difference lies in identifying the leading cause of climate change and suggested solutions. AIT identifies fossil fuel energy source technology as the main cause. It thoroughly explains the cause and justification, with little attention to solutions. CWS argues that animal agriculture is the leading cause of climate change and pays more attention to solutions based on this cause. BTF identifies all the causes mentioned in AIT and CWS and suggests a carbon tax as part of the solution. The common factor, however, lies in their style of presentation. Each documentary integrates the issue into their own personal story and narrates the climate change story from that perspective. This research illustrates how American documentaries attempt to influence viewers on climate change. Influencing each other on how we view climate change, ​is influencing climate change.",

The role of Dutch Moroccan rap music in the process of identity formation among Dutch Moroccan youth in the Netherlands,"Maqdache, Yasmine","['Haneen, Omari']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Over the last 30 years, the Moroccan migration waves in the Netherlands contributed to a change of ''the Dutch culture’’. The arrival of this group has influenced this dynamic process. The integration policies of the government changed as well over time. Since 9/11 and the murder of politician Pim Fortuyn and director Theo van Gogh, the political debate in the Netherlands seems to be entirely focused on how the ‘national identity’ is threatened by Muslim fundamentalism and the alleged failure of the ethnic integration policy of a multicultural society. In the current Dutch political climate, Dutch-Moroccan youth are often labelled as a root problem, paired with a lot of negative (media) attention. The (mostly) negative appearance of Dutch-Moroccan youth in the public sphere also affects the formation of their identity. Aside from being subjected to many negative stereotypes, this group received little academic nor media attention within the Dutch society. Trying to break from the negative stereotypes, Dutch-Moroccan rappers use hip-hop music as a tool to resist. This research analysed Dutch-Moroccan rap music to understand the process of identity formation. Through this research, the main question is answered of what the role is of Dutch Moroccan rap music in the process of identity formation among Dutch Moroccan youth in the Netherlands. This provided a deeper understanding of how the analysed Dutch Moroccan rappers present themselves, and represent others. The analysis of the lyrics provided an insight into the individual story of the analysed Dutch Moroccan artists: Appa and Salah Edin.","['Dutch Moroccan youth', 'rap music', 'identity formation', 'integration', 'migration policy', 'alienation', 'resistance']"
"Multa Tuli in Homer, Hesiod and the Hymns. Τhe functional synonymy of ἄλγος, κῆδος & πῆμα as expressions of sorrow in Epic Greek.","Schoubben, Niels","['Van Beek, Lucien']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines in detail the functional synonymy of three Homeric words for sorrow, i.e. ἄλγος, κῆδος and πῆμα. In contrast with earlier treatments of the topic who either start from a metrical (Witte) or a purely semantic approach (Mawet, Rijksbaron), it is argued here that one has to combine both approaches for a fuller understanding of the functioning of these lexemes within the context of the Homeric Kunstsprache. ἄλγος is interpreted on the basis of a semantic and morphosyntactic analysis as the solitary tribulations mankind has to face during his/her lifetime, whereas κῆδος rather emphasizes the affective component of suffering and indicates a more abstract suffering. πῆμα, finally, refers to the concrete ‘source of sorrow’ and, hence, can be seen as the cause of ἄλγος and κῆδος. It is, however, necessary to keep in mind that metrical considerations sometimes oblige traditional singers to adapt this basic difference in meaning, a process that is fully studied in the third and final chapter of this paper.","['Greek linguistics', 'Homeric Kunstsprache', 'Semantics', 'Morphosyntax', 'Metrics']"
"""Good Governance"" in Northern Syria: Utopia or Political Reality?","Sahbegovic, Amina","['Henderson, Christian']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Failure of governance, including domination, social exclusion, lack of social and economic freedom, and policies that favour elites can lead to social unrest. Causes of conflicts do not only come from economic and political grievances, but also from problems of governance. In the Middle East and North Africa, where patronage systems prevail and ethnic and religious tensions are dominant, the need to discuss issues of governance is important. In Syria, where protests from the Arab Spring led to an ongoing civil war, the northern part of the country is following a ‘third way’: the implementation of democratic autonomy and communes in which all ethnic and religious groups live together. The Rojava Revolution is an example of how people, no matter their backgrounds, can live together and where the patriarchal system can be subverted by overcoming nation-state principles. While definitions on the concept of good governance vary, some of its principles are of particular relevance to security, namely accountability, transparency and participation. In this context, this thesis examines the extent to which these political goods have been achieved in the north and east Syria and question whether the structure in place can set an example for rebuilding governance in conflict-affected areas. Examining local governance dynamics and the self-reliant economy in the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, both in relation to regional and local conditions, provides a way to rethink the establishment of a long-lasting ruling coalition in conflict-affected areas under Middle Eastern terms.","['Good Governance', 'Rojava', 'Democratic autonomy', 'Democratic confederalism', 'Post-conflict governance']"

De Russische Ziel… en of deze beviel: Hoe de Russische landschapsschilderkunst in de tentoonstelling Het Russische Landschap in Nederland en Engeland werd ontvangen,"Ras, Susan","['Boele, Otto']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Russische Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Volgens schrijver Fëdor Dostoevskij begrijpen buitenlanders niks van de Russische landschapskunst. Ook zijn naamgenoot Fëdor Tjutčev schreef dat “het hovaardige oog van de westerling blind is voor het geheime licht dat uit het karige Russische landschap straalt.” Toch was de overzichtstentoonstelling van de Russische landschapsschilderkunst in 2003-2004 in Groningen een groot succes. Ook de pers was doorgaans lovend over de toen voor het westen nog onbekende schilderijen. In de westerse wereld werd de Russische landschapskunst eerder decennialang opzijgeschoven. Hoe werd de Russische landschapsschilderkunst op de tentoonstelling Het Russische Landschap ontvangen in Nederland? Om deze vraag te beantwoorden is in de literatuurstudie een historisch overzicht geïntegreerd en wordt toegelicht hoe de tentoonstelling tot stand is gekomen. Na dit historische overzicht wordt gedemonstreerd op welke manieren de Russische landschapsschilderkunst kan worden benaderd: zowel apolitieke natuurervaringen als chauvinistisch Russische trots kunnen door de werken bij de kijker worden opgewekt. Dit laatste kan worden bereikt door zowel modderige landwegen als weelderige bossen. Er wordt hier ook ingegaan op de uitlatingen van Dostoevskij en Tjutčev over het buitenlandse onbegrip. De literatuurstudie wordt afgesloten met een artikel van Ellen Rutten, waarin wordt opgemerkt dat in Groningen mensen vooral afkwamen op de Russische Ziel. Om deze laatste bewering te testen is een kwantitatief onderzoek opgesteld. De expositie werd doorverkocht aan the National Gallery, en dus kon zowel de Engelse als Nederlandse media-aandacht worden onderzocht. Het extra aantal bronnen uit Engeland dat hierdoor is toegevoegd maakt de percentages een stuk betrouwbaarder en minder afhankelijk van toeval. In elke gevonden relevante bron is gezocht naar een veertiental kenmerken. Aan de hand hiervan kan worden afgeleid op welke manier het westen de Russische landschapskunst heeft binnengehaald. Een van de grootste ontdekkingen in het kwantitatieve onderzoek was het verschil tussen de Nederlandse en Engelse krantenartikelen, die uitgebreid worden toegelicht. Verder toont dit werkstuk aan dat in Nederland vele bronnen meegingen in de Russische Ziel, maar ook andere kenmerken erg vaak werden genoemd. Het landschap werd in Groningen en Nederland zowel intrinsiek als nationaal geïnterpreteerd, en deze twee benaderingen blijken elkaar ook niet uit te sluiten.","['Groninger Museum', 'Russische landschapskunst', 'Het Russische Landschap']"

Serving as reminiscent of the Soviet era, the current leader Alexander Lukashenko has established himself as a dictator since 1994, cementing a partially totalitarian state that has thus managed to quell all threats to the status quo. From an academic perspective there are endless social and cultural questions to be put forward regarding such an irregularity in this modern day. With strict laws regarding freedom of speech and almost certain jail-time if caught protesting it has led to a society which on a whole adheres to their government’s commands without question. Supposedly democratic elections were held but in reality, they were a charade, masking the ongoing geopolitical turbulence. The opposition to Lukashenko over the years has been mainly from other puppets of his own, with genuine contenders given little chance to oppose. The 2010 election and the arrest of Vladimir Neklyayev after a peaceful protest in Minsk was a prime example of the type of democracy that Lukashenko upholds (Hedenskog, 2015, 1).",
The Influence of Confucian Family System over LGBT Rights in Japan,"Duque Rangel, July Carolina","['Choi, Nankyung']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the influence of the Confucian family system over lesbian, gay men, bisexual, and transsexual rights, LGBT rights, in Japan. This thesis investigates how this family system portrays hegemonic gender roles over the Japanese population. One of the outcomes is that the Confucian family system created a registry system, or Koseki Seido which dates back the Tokugawa era. The koseki seido has been an obstacle for these LGBT communities to have a legal status in Japan. Also, the traditionalist nature of the Japanese society has severely impacted the efforts of these minority groups in obtaining civil rights, when compared to more LGBT-friendly countries. Even though LGBT communities have not obtained a legal status within Japan’s society, since 2015 the Shibuya prefecture has been issuing same-sex partnerships that have granted these communities a better legal status. The partnership certificates are not legally binding; however, same-sex couples can be afforded the same civil rights as that of opposite-sex couples. The inclusion of the same-sex partnership certificates as a case study serves to illustrate how Japan is progressing in adapting LGBT rights, albeit slowly.","['Confucianism', 'LGBT Civil Rights', 'Japan']"

In contrast to other studies, I investigate why some MNCs are doing better with respect to the uptake of human rights within their business operations in by exploring the role of (the threat of) corporate human rights litigation. I find the following: first, there is an association between the ranking of MNC according to the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB) and the human rights lawsuits the MNCs faced. Second, based on a case study of three MNCs there appears that most MNCs adopted human rights measures during or after they were confronted with human rights litigation, pushing the uptake of human rights by MNCs. Lastly, there is a rising trend of foreign direct liability cases against MNCs for human rights violations. Based on a comparative case study, it appears that these cases oftentimes do not bring any judicial outcome due to procedural requirements that are in most cases difficult to fulfil by the plaintiff. However, it seems that in most instances a judicial verdict is not compulsory to push a company towards the uptake of human rights within their business operations.","['Human rights', 'Litigation', 'Multinational Corporations', 'Foreign Direct Liability']"

At the beginning of the New Kingdom period, ancient Egypt restored its former power and glory, which resulted in wealth and splendor, especially for the royal and elite classes in the social strata. Replete with religious symbolism the rather rudimentary and simple floral decoration and offerings such as bundles of lilies and papyrus gave rise to much more artfully created designs of threaded floral garlands, collars, and bouquets characterized by the significant development of the floral wares. The primary objective of wearing adornments is for decorative purpose, but this was not always the case as in ancient times in many cases they were intended to represent a symbol of status, had a religious or protective function 1. Therefore, the goal of this research paper is to examine the symbolic attributes of the floral garlands and collars discovered adorning the mummies from the New Kingdom Period and early Third Intermediate Period in ancient Egypt. Firstly, an introduction will be given about the different techniques of production and the handicraftsmen who were in charge of creating these floral wreaths. Secondly, parallels of both types, collars, and garlands from royal and elite tombs will be discussed in order to achieve a more detailed identification of the vegetative elements. Further, depictions and representations of these floral adornments will be presented in forms of faience jewelry, imitations on regalia, depictions of floral garlands on furniture, coffins, and masks, wall paintings and other portrayals. Fourthly, all vegetative elements and their colors identified in this paper will be interpreted, and their symbolism will be discussed. Finally, in the last chapter, coming from the New Kingdom Period preserved written records of the symbolic meaning of these floral garlands will be presented, which will lead the reader to the main beliefs ancient Egyptians had for this type of fresh floral decoration.","['floral garlands', 'collars', 'new kingdom', 'sacred garlands', 'rebirth']"

The US from the start saw it as a vital condition that West Germany joins the Western allies in order to help its nation’s rebuilding and to upgrade Germany’s European role and diplomatic relations. Since the early days of Kennedy’s administration, a complex relationship between the West Germany and the US is distinguishable. It could be said that West Germany became the locomotive of implication of US policy in Europe. Kennedy used Germany’s question towards West’s favor. The FRG not only became a representative of American policy and American thinking but also played the role of the mediator amongst European nations which at the time were not as synchronized and responsive as they should towards the new situation, regarding European and national security and safety. However, it seems that the German administration, during the last two years of the Berlin Crisis brought great headaches to the US president and his team.","['Cold War', 'Berlin', 'Berlin Wall', 'USA', 'FRG', 'Berlin Crisis']"

The hunt in ancient Egypt: an examination and re-evaluation of the primary sources from the Early-Dynastic Period to the New Kingdom,"Koornstra, Emmely","['Van Walsem, Réne']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"It is a well-known fact that hunting was an integral part of the ancient Egyptian society. From the Early-dynastic period onwards, hunting appears as an important subject in iconographical as well as in textual sources. In Egyptology hunting is often represented as a symbolic act of fighting the forces of evil, manifesting itself in animals. This idea is often applied to many sources in every historical period of Egyptian history, without taking into consideration the occurring changes on how hunting is represented to us in Egypt’s long history. The question is then: how did the concept of hunting and its significance develop from the Early-Dynastic Period to the New Kingdom 20th dynasty, and what are the main problems encountered when studying the development, and significance of hunting in ancient Egypt? In order to answer this question we must analyse the primary sources themselves. Iconographic depictions of hunting appear on royal monuments as well on monuments dedicated to the elite such as tombs, but also on objects used in daily life. Besides there are also textual sources which tell us about hunt. This great variety in contexts means it is paramount to study these sources in their proper context. This proves that most sources have their own significance in their own context, and that we cannot apply one single interpretation to all sources concerned with hunting. The primary sources indicate that the iconographical representation, and ideological meaning of hunting changed throughout Egyptian history. It is these changes that will be discussed during in this thesis. Different kinds of hunting will be discussed such as fishing, fowling, the hippopotamus hunt, and desert hunt.","['Hunting', 'Ancient Egypt', 'Fishing', 'Fowling', 'Desert hunt', 'Hippopotamus hunt']"

Poverty Trends in Europe: Explaining Unequal Outcomes in Spain and Ireland,"Mujica, Sergio","['Broad, Matthew']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2016 it would have been difficult to imagine that Ireland and Spain once shared similar economic contexts. While in 2007 they were both experiencing similar macroeconomic conditions, and underwent similar processes in dealing with the crisis, nine years later the Irish economy had managed to regain its pre-crisis standards, whereas Spain’s continued to lag behind. Particularly telling of these developments are poverty trends, with Ireland presenting an overall decrease in its At-Risk-of-Poverty or Social Exclusion (AROPE) figures over 2007 and 2016, and Spain being unable to do so. Consequently, given their similarities prior to the Great Recession, the question of “what explains the diverging poverty trends between Ireland and Spain between 2007 and 2016?” arises. Turning to the academic and theoretical literature, the paper identifies four variables which could explain these outcomes: economic growth and income inequalities; (un)employment levels and conditions; welfare state effectiveness; and political inequality. These variables were assessed with reference to Eurostat and OECD data, with the analysis being complemented by NGO reports and government publications. Overall, findings indicate that three principal factors can explain these diverging poverty trends: I) the fact that income inequalities were widespread in Spain, even during periods of growth, while they were relatively stable in Ireland; II) Spain’s inability to avoid an increase in rising labor precariousness, and; III) the effectiveness of Ireland’s welfare state in reducing poverty levels. The fourth variable under investigation, the role of political inequalities, provided inconclusive results.","['Poverty', 'Spain', 'Ireland', 'Inequality', 'AROPE']"

Regarding Visuality: Understanding Apartheid Photography as a Tool for Resistance Through the Visual Turn in IR,"Bosch, Adriane W.M.","['Thakur, Vineet']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Photography is a versatile medium that is able to freeze a single moment in time as well as provide insight into the zeitgeist of a longer period. Therein lies part of the value of the medium of photography, as well as a political application. This thesis explores this claim further and considers photography as a tool for resistance in the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. This illustrates a larger point, namely that aesthetic theory adds to our understanding of international relations, especially regarding power relations and resistance. This premise is located in larger body of literature as part of Bleiker’s aesthetic turn in IR and Danchev’s concept of witnessing. From this flows an analysis of parrhesia, as the South African photographer speaks truth to power, as well as an examination of visual normativity, everyday resistance and memory. The conceptual framework is constructed on Sontag en Butler’s review on the medium of photography, and Rancière’s treatment of the relation between aesthetics and politics. Images from apartheid photographers such as David Goldblatt and Ernest Cole are analysed to shed light on these theoretical concepts and further demonstrate how power operated during apartheid, but also how norms are subverted and the white hegemony resisted. This thesis thus concludes that aesthetic theory in general and photography in particular is an important resource in the field of IR to foster a better understanding of power relations, conflict and resistance.","['International Relations Theory', 'Photography', 'Resistance', 'Aestheticism', 'Apartheid']"
"A ""Third World"" in a Cold War","Porter, Robert W.","['Stolte, Carolien']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Navigating the early Cold War during the 1950s was no easy task for states and international organisations, given the changing dynamics and intrigues of Cold War geopolitics and the onset of decolonisation across Asia and Africa. In this period, a number of national, regional and international political organisations emerged across the “Third World” which sought to establish their own movements and support based on their own ideology. The Asian Socialist Conference, 1953-1960, was one such organisation which came into existence in this period and attempted to navigate the early Cold War. Significant limitations faced organisations like the ASC as they addressed the “great problems”, relating to European colonialism and the Cold War, facing the world. In a broader context, the limitations the ASC faced explain the difficulties “Third World” Afro-Asian networks in navigating the Cold War. Through a more Asian-centric approach, the purpose of this analysis will therefore be to analyse and explain the limitations the ASC faced in its endeavour to resolve the great world problems of the 1950s and how those limitations show the difficulties “Third World” Afro-Asian networks had in navigating early Cold War.","['Asian Socialism', 'Decolonisation', 'Cold War', 'Asian Socialist Conference', 'Third World', 'Afro-Asian Networks', 'Anti-colonialism']"
An Anachronistic Society: on the use of the analog during the digital age,"Bolieiro, Maria Rita","['Shobeiri, Ali']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since the late 1950s, analog technology began to be replaced by digital technology, leading to the start of the digital age. Although we are presently living in the digital age and most of our forms of technology and communication are correspondingly digital, there has been a conspicuous proliferation and return to analog technologies in the arts and culture. With an increasing fetishization of retro and analog, photographers raised during the digital age still make use of analog photography. This thesis investigates this fetishization by examining the potentials of instant and film photography that attract digital photographers and how they approach them. The aesthetics of nostalgia and analog are construed to assess how they can be applied to the digital and to consider how they are marketed. Materiality as a potential of instant photography is subsequently considered along with how it has been used by female artists as a self-empowering tool. Further, the potential of cinematic gaze in film photography and how it applies the quirky sensibility is considered, which leads to the study of how the cinematic gaze is equally used to redefine how the female body is viewed. Thus, this thesis seeks to comprehend several potentials of analog photography such as nostalgic value, materiality and cinematic use and how they have been appropriated by society, the market and artists.","['photography', 'analog photography', 'nostalgia', 'retromania', 'retromediation', 'materiality', 'cinematic gaze', 'photo-object']"

When the Rail Meets National Interests Historical Development of Railway Politics on the Russo-Chinese Border (1890s-2018),"Melidonis, Margherita","['Roberts, Flora J.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The encounter between railway development and national interests can come to play a meaningful role in inter-state ties; as a result, railways upgrade from mere transportation means to acquire political relevance and meaning. This is the case of Russia and China which, since the construction of a rail apparatus across their North-Eastern frontiers in the 1890s, have used railways as part and parcel of their national policies of power expansion. Consequently, railways have become not only a political tool embedded in the geopolitics of the region, but a form of politics in its own right. This study engages in a chronological analysis of historical evidence that substantiates the relationship between railway construction and national policies in Sino-Russian border developments over the period. In addition, it adopts a multifactor approach that matches the investigation on railway construction in Sino-Russian borderlands with a thematic focus on their political dimension in bilateral relations, as well as their political dimension. All data are gathered and analyzed from primary and secondary sources, especially government publications, diplomatic reports, official directives and historically-coeval publications. The results of this study identify patterns of continuity and characteristics that support the following claims: (1) from the 1890s onwards, railways have more than once performed the role of economic and administrative means to the advancement of a nation’s power; (2) railway construction is likely to continue to influence contemporary exchanges between Russia and China; (3) the respective use of railway politics by either Russia or China varies according to the balance of power between the two. These results are based on four main case studies on the most influential railway ventures in Sino-Russian border regions: the Manchurian Route, the CER, the BAM and the most recent CMR Railway. Studying the development of railway politics between Russia and China not only re-evaluates the importance of rail infrastructure in politics but it can also shed new light on contemporary Chinese influence in Eurasia.",

El lado oscuro de la moda. La industria de confección de ropa e informalidad en Buenos Aires,"Van Gorp, Lieslore","['Aguiar, José Carlos G.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Latijns-Amerikastudies (BA),Master thesis,es,"The rise of globalization in the Occident after WWII was accompanied by neoliberal policies based on economic expansion. In the case of Argentina, the country was affected by this neoliberal wave from the seventies on. Globalization provoked a global increase of competition between workers and workplaces. The market knew less and less frontiers which made that intense labour tasks, those which require handwork for example, are shifted to countries or places with lower salaries and poor labour protection. Industrial production suffers from the increasing importance of economic expansion. The existence of sweatshops is directly related to these neoliberal open market policies since this change in the economic scene has a big influence on the clothing industry. Countries start to import cheap prêt-à-porter clothes from Asian countries and force their own domestic clothing industry to lower their prices in order to survive. Some clothing businesses start to outsource the production process by moving it to the informal economy in order to avoid costs. The outsourcing of the production process favours big companies while the working conditions get worse for producers. These changes and economic factors lead to the existence of sweatshops. This research aims at analysing how brands benefit from the informal economy and the use of sweatshops for the production of their clothes and describe the profile of sweatshops in Buenos Aires and their employees. Around 20.000 sweatshops are based in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires. In these sweatshops, cheap clothes for informal markets as well as expensive clothes for prestigious brands are made, sometimes alongside each other in the same sweatshop. The particular sweatshops based in Buenos Aires are located in small buildings, as houses, where they are invisible for passing citizens. Worldwide there is a trend that most sweatshop workers are migrants, in Argentina most sweatshops workers and heads of the sweatshops are of Bolivian origin. Work conditions in sweatshops are very bad. People often get the feeling of being locked up in the sense that they have no better option or see no way out of the situation, sometimes people are also physically locked up in the workplaces. The fashion industry is always moving, brands require extreme flexibility from their producers. These demands are impossible to achieve by working according to existing labour rights. Brands take advantage of the subcontracting of producers inside the informal economy to meet with the shifting demands of their clients. Sweatshops pay the price of this fast fashion trend throughout the world.","['sweatshops', 'Buenos Aires', 'informal economy', 'clothing industry']"

On the path towards a stronger Europe: Tracing the development of strategic culture in EU external action,"Luijk, Sarah van","['David, Maxine']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the 2016 EU Global Strategy, High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini called for a “stronger Europe” in response to the continuous string of crises and challenges the EU faced in the past decade. Since the institutionalization of Common Foreign and Security Policy, and Common Security and Defence Policy and with the gradual emergence of the EU as a foreign policy actor, scholars have tried to craft appropriate concepts, frameworks and approaches which would allow them to define and study the EU’s characteristics, role and ability in the realm of external action. Strategic culture is one of these concepts which tries to answer core questions about what influences and drives strategic behaviour in foreign policy, like a “compass” which can help an actor navigate and pursue its strategic priorities. In an effort to contribute to the under-researched body of literature on this concept, this paper studies the development of EU strategic culture by comparing the 2003 European Security Strategy with the 2016 Global Strategy. These documents codify strategic culture by providing written accounts of the EU’s shared values, interests and the means it defines as appropriate to pursue these interests. The findings confirm that an EU strategic culture has developed between 2003 and 2016, notably by defining a set of shared values and interests for the first time, through its ability to identify and update its threat assessments based on recent changes in its environment, as well as thanks to a range of concrete tool-building proposals guided by these norms and interests, notably in the field of military capabilities.","['EU Foreign Policy', 'Foreign Policy', 'External Relations', 'External Action', 'EU', 'Strategic culture', 'EU strategic culture', 'European Security Strategy', 'European strategic culture', 'EU Global Strategy']"

Research has shown that a transboundary peace park which incorporates the dimensions of tourism and ecological conservation can be regarded as an effective way to establish peace provided that it is equally co-managed by the two countries. Through compiling theories on the language of peace and soft power projects initiating peacebuilding mechanisms, a comprehensive research framework was established for the examination of the DMZ World Eco-Peace Park proposal. Analysis demonstrated that proper peacebuilding measures are integrated in the development plan, however, acknowledgements on identity construction, the location, and tourism and ecological conservation regulations are lacking. These results indicate that the development plans are unfinished and currently being hindered by the insufficiently stable inter-Korean environment. Consequently, it is recommended the ROK government continues to promote the peaceful use of the DMZ and gather international supports as they anticipate the appropriate circumstances, whilst improving their proposal. Further research is required to further intelligence on the North Korean perspective on the peaceful use of the DMZ and the implications of cooperation and reunification for the DMZ area.","['Peace Planning', 'Korean Demilitarized Zone', 'Peace Park']"
The Strategic Role of Sina Weibo in Sensitive Online Discourses: An analysis of online discourse regarding homosexuality and the role of Sina Weibo in online movement,"Sun, Sijie","['Nie, Yuxi']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The development of digital media provides audiences easier access to information from multiple sources. In the past decades, with the popularization of the internet, the emergence of social media and the fast increasing number of users have become a social phenomenon around the world. In particular, China as a country with its isolated internet has developed its own social media platforms which under a system with strong state control and censorship. Apart from strong state control, Chinese social media platforms gradually take the role of reflecting public opinions through an online discussion about political or social issues. As one of the largest social media platforms in China, Sina Weibo plays a remarkable role in online discussion and governmental supervision. This thesis particularly analyzes Sina Weibo’s role in an online social discussion regarding homosexuality and homosexual people in China, in order to understand the role of Sina Weibo in online discourses regarding a moral issue, and to further investigate the implication for online social discussions. The role taken by Sina Weibo can thus be argued as “strategic positions to survive”, based on the relation with the users and Chinese authorities. In this case, a power relation among Weibo users, Chinese authorities and Weibo users could also be conducted from research findings.","['Online discourse', 'Sina Weibo', 'Social media', 'Homosexuality', 'Online movement']"

Burundi: on the brink of a UN peacekeeping operation?,"Nicolaï, Veerle","[""O'Malley, A.M. (Alanna)""]",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The world looks away as blood flows in Burundi’ (Graham-Harrison, 10th of April 2016, The Guardian). Since 2015 the safety situation in Burundi is deteriorating, yet the international community doesn’t act upon it, even though scholars and political observers warn that it is important to sustain international attention to Burundi (Lotze and Martins, 2015, p. 268). Moreover, Burundi is ranked in the top 3 of under-reported crises of 2017 (Ratcliffe, 2018). whereas, at the same time the country is also reported to have one of the highest rates of children with stunted growth caused by hunger or undernourishment, namely 55,9 percent (Global Hunger Index 2018, p. 16-17). Thus, while the international press hardly mentioned the country, on the 14th of June 2019, there was a briefing of the Security Council on Burundi in which the Assistant Secretary-General, Mr. Fernandez-Taranco, voices his concern over human rights and the humanitarian situation in the country. With the upcoming elections in 2020 Mr. Fernandez Taranco is worried about the ‘many reported violations of fundamental civic and political freedoms’ and the increasing food insecurity (Taranco, Briefing Security Council on Burundi, 14th of June 2019). Aren’t these enough reasons to wonder why there’s no UN peacekeeping operation (PKO) deployed in Burundi? Intervention, in the form of a peacekeeping operation can, in some cases, meet a lot of criticism; intervening in another country is a difficult task. Yet, sometimes intervention by a UN peacekeeping mission is the only option to bring enduring peace. But how does the UN Security Council (UN SC) decide in which country they will deploy a PKO? This thesis will focus on two aspects: first, the role of the member states of the Security Council, in which national interest often plays a role in their contribution during the UN SC meetings (Jakobsen, 1996). Second, this thesis will focus on another actor that might influence the decision-making process of the Security Council: the media. This thesis aims to focus on an understanding of the decision-making process of the UN Security Council that goes beyond regular realist interpretation in which the member states are central; this thesis will focus on the construction of the discourse. Therefore this research question is proposed: How does the discourse used in the UN Security Council meeting records and international media contribute to the context in which the UN Security Council decided to start MINUSCA and end ONUB? Can these discourses explain why there’s no Peacekeeping Operation deployed in Burundi recently? This will be investigated by analyzing UN Security Council meeting records and media coverage of these two situations. I will use a post-structuralist approach because its focus on language and discourse can reveal constructed ideas of how respectively the members of the UN Security Council approached the MINUSCA and ONUB debate, and how the media portrayed the situation in CAR and Burundi.Assuming that the discourse used by the members of the Security Council and in the media contributes to the decisions made about PKO’s, results of this research will be interesting for states who believe deploying a PKO in their, or a neighbouring country, is necessary. In that case, it might be beneficial to seek attention from international media, preferably media in countries that are UN SC member. Furthermore, I hope this research will contribute to abolish inequality in cases like Burundi; even if there’s little attention in the UN SC and little media coverage, deploying a PKO could still be justifiable. After elaborating on my methodology, I will discuss the ethnic conflicts in both Burundi and CAR and end with the similarities and differences between those cases. Secondly, I will elaborate on the first and second generation of PKO’s. Thirdly, I will elaborate on media influence on foreign policy, and in particular on PKO’s and the Security Council. Subsequently, this thesis will analyze the UN SC meeting records and media coverage and end with the conclusion in which I present recommendations for future decision-makers on PKO’s and further research.","['UN peacekeeping operation', 'Burundi', 'Central African Republic']"
Brave New Borders: Criminalisation of humanitarian NGOs in Greece,"Zuijderduijn, R.R.","['Cusumano, E.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis addresses the issue of hostility towards migrant-aiding NGOs operating in Greece, and in particular acts of hostility and criminalisation of NGOs by state actors. The thesis argues that the European response to border policing and migration management, especially during and after the 'European refugee crisis' of 2015-2016, is permeating a destabilising environment for those who give support to migrants and try to uphold traditional humanitarian values. To support this claim, the thesis present theory and examples of a number of restrictive and punitive measures which have facilitated the process of criminalisation in Greece. The purpose of the thesis is to demonstrate that the initial emergence of autonomous migrant and refugee solidarity movements is in opposition of attempts by national and supranational state actors to securitise the EU's external borders. Furthermore, the thesis argues that processes of criminalisation of aid and solidarity towards irregular migrants ultimately perpetuate a politics of invisibility and indifference, which serves to conceal the EU’s failure to provide adequate humanitarian care to migrants. In doing so, the thesis supports Tugba Basaran’s theory on the societal implications that accompany the practice of criminalising specific forms of aid (2015).

Onderzoek naar de vereiste omvang per niveau is gewenst voor een robuuster ERK. Milton & Alexiou (2009) onderzochten voor verschillende Europese talen welke woordenschatomvang bij verschillende taalniveaus hoort. Snakkers (2017) koppelde receptieve woordenschatomvang aan leesvaardigheid op niveau A2 en B1 van het Nederlands als tweede taal (NT2). Frederiks (2017) deed dat voor productieve woordenschatomvang ten opzichte van schrijfvaardigheid op niveau B1 en B2. Het huidige onderzoek tracht een aanvulling hierop te zijn. De onderzoeksvraag luidt ‘Wat is de relatie tussen woordenschatomvang en schrijfvaardigheid van NT2-leerders met ERK-niveau A2?’. Ten eerste werden een taak voor schrijfvaardigheid op niveau A2 en een toets voor productieve woordenschatomvang bij 18 leerders van het NT2 afgenomen. Deze laatste taak bleek echter te moeilijk te zijn voor (lager opgeleide) leerders op dit niveau. Vervolgens werden scores op de taak voor schrijfvaardigheid en scores op een toets voor receptieve woordenschatomvang verkregen van 19 leerders. Tegen de verwachting in bleek er geen verband tussen deze scores van schrijfvaardigheid en receptieve woordenschatomvang te zijn (Kendall’s correlatie, τ = .243, p = .166).","['ERK', 'woordenschat', 'schrijfvaardigheid', 'NT2', 'A2']"

Syrians in Exile “How do the acculturation strategies among Syrian Refugees differ in Morocco and the Netherlands?”,"Fritz, Laura Valerie","['Immerzeel, Mattheus']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"My Thesis deals with the difference in the acculturation processes of Syrians in exile in Morocco and the Netherlands. The main analysis is based on interviews which have been conducted in Morocco and the Netherlands with Syrians who sought refuge in the respective countries to compare the personal experiences while taking into consideration different policy matters, legal questions, and cultural differences. These interviews were then analysed through the theoretical framework of acculturation to answer the research question. Acculturation as theoretical framework is composed of four different strategies for intercultural contact. The core of the acculturation strategies is based on how much of the cultural heritage an individual is willing or forced to leave behind to achieve the desired acculturation strategy. The first presented strategy is termed separation, which applies when an individual holds on to the heritage culture and avoids intercultural contact. Secondly, the assimilation strategy applies when the individual seeks daily contact with new cultures and does not maintain the culture of origin. The third strategy is called marginalization which applies when the maintenance of the original culture does not apply and desire to maintain relations with others is missing. The final and most desired acculturation strategy is termed integration and applies when an individual seeks intercultural contact but also maintains the culture of origin. Morocco and The Netherlands were chosen because of a great difference in geopolitics which influence the process of acculturation for the Syrians residing in these two countries.","['Syrians', 'Refugees', 'acculturation', 'migration', 'Morocco', 'The Netherlands']"

As a result of the rapidly digitalizing world, a part of these researches is preserved by digital means. An excellent solution as it provides worldwide access, and the material is protected against non-digital threats, like theft or fire. However, how can we guarantee the use of these materials in the future? What format should be used now, in order to prevent access or usage problems in the future? Previous research has been done on different formats and their function, but also in the relevance of language and culture archives. However, the connection between those two topics, has not been researched, as digital archives have not been the first concern to research in the last years. In addition, digital archives are relatively young, and the above-stated potential problems may lay far ahead in the future for some archives. This study researched the format possibilities for the ‘Archivo de Lenguas, Culturas y Memorias Históricas del Ecuador’ (ALCME), an archive in Ecuador. The results consist of a list of proposed formats, based on the media type used, desired options, and original characteristics of the file. Furthermore, in order to be useful and accessible for the coming fifty years, backup methods are recommended as well for ALCME. These results are relevant for ALCME itself, as they prepare and build a solid base in regard to formats for the coming fifty years. However, this is not only relevant for ALCME, as other digital archives can follow the same steps that are described in this study. Furthermore, besides digital archives, other companies who work with formats and backup methods can extract relevant information from this study, suited to their company.",

Not So SWIFT: An In-Depth Analysis of Economic Alternatives for Sanctioned States,"Balagh, Tyler","['Ennis, Crystal']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Through recent decades, Iran has consistently been faced with economic sanctions by the United States. Due to the hegemony the United States has over international monetary systems, sanctions can be detrimental. This was displayed in 2012 when Iran was sanctioned by The Society for Worldwide Interbank Telecommunication (SWIFT), an interbank messaging platform which can be influenced by the United States. SWIFT is responsible for facilitating $5 trillion USD in settlements daily. As a result, the Iranian economy suffered greatly as they could not facilitate their oil sales with international partners without SWIFT. This thesis seeks to find alternative payment and messaging platforms which may compete with SWIFT and assist in sanctioned countries to avoid the current hegemonic nature of payment and messaging platforms. In finding alternatives, two stand at the forefront of this economic discourse for sanctioned states. One being the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System which was established as a result of the internationalization of the RMB. And the rise of RippleNet, a blockchain based messaging and payment platform which has emerged due to the technological advances in the finance industry. In doing so, the paper analyzes shifts in global finance and its subsequent impact on sanctioned countries.","['Cryptocurrency', 'SWIFT', 'Sanctions', 'Iran', 'China', 'United States', 'CIPS', 'Ripple']"

The Divergent Discussion Surrounding the Japanese Phenomena: A Critical Analysis into Japanese Economic Development in the 1950s,"IJmkers, Ian","['Koyama, Hitomi']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Amidst an ever-changing international order, and the growing importance of the role of the business in international relations, it is important to analyze the foundations of the business communities. Businesses function in diverse ways, from working in close relations with the state to diminishing physical boundaries through the reach of Multinational Corporations. The role of business is increasingly under focus, due to its role in facilitating mainly economic benefits, but also cultural, social, and even political ones. The mobility of businesses and their limitless access to innovation allows them to become a perfect candidate to attract and influence massive amounts of consumers globally, making it one of the more crucial actors in international relations today. While businesses were traditionally looked upon as simply being economically potent, the perspective has now shifted to how businesses influence culture, social and political affairs. According to the research, Western corporations functioned in more adhocracy-style management with moderate control due to their attention to flexibility and differentiation with competitors; n environment rooted in more individualization then collective thought. The analysis highlighted that for Japanese corporations, Japan’s national culture of consent has oriented Japanese corporations towards a more clan-like management style with a focus on the external market (competitiveness), as well as being an organic process that understands the needs of the individual. The analysis provides a unique opportunity to analyze the extent of how much corporate culture is influenced by the state's input on culture in Japanese corporations. While such classification appears convincing, their classificatory approaches nonetheless raise several questions such as: what does corporate culture really mean? While these authors interchangeably use tradition and culture, is culture really rooted in tradition? Or is it a dynamic tool that can be invented for the purpose of others in relation to the dichotomy that exists between the “organic” dynamism of culture vs. its bureaucratic purposes? How is the Japanese case so unique, and how significant is it? At the core of Japanese developmentalism, there exists a clear distinction between tradition and culture and is essential to building a Japanese national identity. This was because culture utilized aspects of tradition to reinvent what Japanese culture meant at the time based on external factors. The success of the Japanese developmental state model is attributed to the state’s creative appropriation of tradition, yet this shows that the term can be used as a tool to further the state’s ambitions.","['Japan', 'Economic Development', 'Zaibatsu', '1950', 'Corporate Culture', 'Business culture']"

movimento 5 stelle and social media a methodological inquiry,"iudica, nicolo","['broad, matthew']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Wrapping up the entire work, it appears that M5S constitutes an vanguardist party, that has been able to exploit the potential of contemporary socio/political phenomena such as distrust towards traditional politics (developed over the years) to further their political ends. Social media, as it has been discussed throughout the entire work, played a crucial role in this process. The aim of this thesis was to understand how M5S exploit social media to further their political ends, aiming to uncover their methods. Throughout my research I have isolated the following points: the employment of the Rousseau System, a polling system that supposedly would have allowed an activist to actively participate to the internal decision making process; my research showed how it appears that the Rousseau system mainly acts as a tool to legitimise decision taken from above, placing the system far from a direct democracy tool; the negative campaigning, as shown by a comparative research on the type of social media posts employed by the three most voted parties during the 2018 elections, appears that the majority of post used by M5S have the aim of discrediting the opponents; this tendency shows a significant lack of content, which has been further confirmed with the section I called “the ideological role played by data collection”; the aspect of virality, the creation of social media content explicitly carrying controversial/ offensive messages, with the implicit aim of “going viral”; within the thesis’ conclusion I compared this point with similar actions taken by Trump, through the lens of the “free media theory”, finding striking similarities; content creation turned into a financial asset, refers to the practise of claiming controversial opinion, producing a content on television, in order to take the performance out of context and post it on social media, with the aim of monetising on it. Similar to the virality point; the war against traditional media, meant as constant discredit of traditional media (television, newspapers) to gain people’s loyalty on forming their opinion exclusively on social media, in order to influence them with any sort of controversial claim given the absence of a filter; the ideological role played by data collection, meaning that data collection on social media appears to be one of the pillars of M5S modus operandi, to the point that data collection assumes the role of what in any other traditional party would be in large measure played by ideology; the support of anti-vaccination campaigns, and of other obscurantist/ controversial claims. This point refers back to “the ideological role played by data collection” as M5S supports this sort of movements basing their moves on data about them; this sort of movement indeed represent a good bait for large portions of people to become supporters of the party; fake news, is the last point I analysed; The fake twitter profile “Beatrice di Maio” constituted a little case study for this point, as it embodies the perfect example of a profile created ad hoc to spread fake news apt to the demonisation of opponents (confirming point one on “negative campaigning”). I compared it to the phenomenon of social media trolls, by the Russian government, spreading fake news pro Putin, and I found interesting points of contact both with Beatrice di Maio and with the point of the main section constituted by “the ideological role played by data collection”, in terms of choosing a categorising profiles to attack.",['social media italy elections']
Cultural Identity and the Representation of Palestinian Women in Cinema: the Case of In Between (2016),"Davila, Carla Sofia","['Omari, Haneen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"“So what happens if I eat what I want, and dress as I want? Too much for you?” Leyla, a woman who lives her life with no constraints, uttered this quote in Palestinian director Maysaloun Hamoud’s film In Between (2016). In Between portrays Arab women in control of their lives who make their own decisions, even if these are frowned upon by their society. This image differs from those in Hollywood films, wherein Arab women have been depicted in groups covered in black robes following their husbands, for example. As these depictions are repeated, audiences may believe the images presented to them, and formulate stereotypes of Arabs. This topic demonstrates that portrayals of Arab women exist in cinema that challenge the stereotype of disempowered Arab women. Furthermore, this topic highlights Arab women’s diversity and the obstacles they face when breaking away from the image expected of them from their societies. Therefore, this thesis will focus on In Between’s portrayal of Arab women to demonstrate that In Between questions the stereotype of disempowered Arab women, and represents Arab women. In order to do so, this thesis will analyze the cultural identities and femininity of Leyla, Salma, and Nour, In Between’s three main characters.","['Identity', 'Representation', 'Palestinian', 'Culture', 'Cinema']"
An ecofeminist approach to the population growth – environment relationship: analysing water security discourse during the Second Palestinian Intifada,"Verdijk, Sari","['Forough, Mamad']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Concerns about environmental security appear to have become a global trend in the past decades. In the occupied Palestinian territories (oPt), which are characterized by the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the ongoing political instability accompanying it, an increase in such concerns has similarly been experienced, especially with regard to the topic of water security. Simultaneously, the oPt are characterized by a population growth rate that exceeds to a significant extent that of most other nations with a similar developmental status. This striking population growth rate can arguably be linked to the Palestinian nationalist movement and its surrounding discourse, which encourages high birth rates in order to win what is sometimes referred to as a ‘demographic battle’ between Israelis and Palestinians. The seemingly contradictory discourses, one regarding population growth and the other regarding environmental, specifically water security form the basis for the research topic of this thesis; the thesis conducts a Critical Discourse Analysis into water security discourse amongst Palestinian NGOs during the Second Intifada, a nationalist uprising taking place at the start of this century.","['oPt', 'ecofeminism', 'environmental discourse', 'water security']"

In the Name of British Cameroon: Post-colonial Languages as Markers of Identity in Cameroon,"Joseph, Ketty","['Williams, Corey']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Language is a complex abstract notion, which helps in shaping particular identities in the process of nation-state building. However, many other variables play a role in the development of individuals identifying as a collective group bearing the same identities. For example, a unique legacy of colonialism in Cameroon is the nation’s division along the Country’s two official colonial languages: English and French. This division has been the source of a recurring pattern of political conflicts between the Anglophone and Francophone. Many scholars narrate colonialism as a link in the creation of two major linguistic identities in-groups through the post-colonial languages. Consequently, the official post-colonial language situation translates into a conflict of division between linguistic groups of belonging, which leads to politics of identity regarding the case of British Cameroon. This results to seeking sovereignty in order to attain the right of self-determination. In order to shed light on British Cameroon’s choice of constructing an Anglophone identity in relation to their regions, this thesis examines the position of post-colonial languages as a tool in re-negotiating social identities, in order to change the present condition of English-speaking Cameroonians. It traces the historical and socio-linguistic emergence of specific pressure groups and activists, who took radical measures in the forming of the Anglophone identity in the space of Cameroon.","['Cameroon', 'Linguistic Identity', 'Nationalism']"
The Sustainability of the United States Security and Defence Policy. -From the Post-Cold War era to nowadays-,"Ambrosetti, Ludovico","['Thakur, Vineet']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The United States defense and security policy saw a lot of changes after the Cold War. This post-Cold War scenario is characterized by American hegemony, created a situation where certain tendencies of the security policy were not needed anymore. In addition to these structural changes that came after the Cold War, growing economic and political competition from China entailed another series of structural change. These changes were happening in a international seting where the United States is dealing with more limited use of resources which have questioned the sustainability of the defence and security policy. The two structural changes that will be analysed are at first the outsourcing of military tasks by the United States in the post Cold War scenario. This was done as the creation of a private market of defence was seen as beneficial due to the possibility of reduced cost, higher efficiency and efficacy. However this was not considering the possibility of deregulation of this industry, the deregulated cost due to opportunistic behaviour of these companies. These tendencies ultimately negatively impacting the sustainability of the security and defence policy. The second change is the lack of sustainable defence spending by the US.","['American Defese and Security Foreign Policy', 'Overstretch', 'Private Military Contractors', 'Sustainability', 'Defese Spending Planning']"
Turkey’s Progressive Self-Determination: From ‘Strategic Depth’ to Contemporary Foreign Policy Vision,"Eruygur, Burc","['Duzgun, Eren']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Turkey is located in a very peculiar geographic location, which has reflected itself on the country’s foreign affairs. While its foreign policy was dominated by a Western-oriented outlook since the country’s foundation, this had changed following the election of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) into power in 2002. Since then, Turkey had undertaken a specific foreign policy approach under its new leadership, which was based on the book ‘Strategic Depth’ written by Prof. Dr. Ahmet Davutoğlu, who has since been considered the mastermind of the AK Party’s foreign policy vision. However, in light of recent developments seen in the country’s foreign affairs, it is possible to detect some stark differences from the soft power vision then and the one seen in a contemporary context. Considering the lack of up-to-date analyses on these divergences, this thesis attempts to uncover how Turkey’s foreign policy vision today can be differentiated from the one referenced in Ahmet Davutoğlu’s book ‘Strategic Depth’, based on the development of the country’s foreign policy under the AK Party and following the outbreak of the Arab Spring.","['Foreign Policy', 'Turkey', 'AK Party', 'Soft Power', 'Ahmet Davutoglu']"

A comparative study on the impact of bilateral migration agreements on migrant rights","Tol, Joscha van","['Lodder, Gerrie']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Irregular migration to the European Union is not a new phenomenon. For decades, migrants have crossed the external borders of the Union illegally, hoping to find a better life. With the abolishment of internal border controls in the European Union, the necessity for increased protection of the external borders arose. This became especially clear when after the Arab Spring uprisings an unprecedented amount of people made their way to Europe, culminating in the 2015 European migration crisis. The response of the EU and its Member States entailed policies of deterrence and entry-prevention. Furthermore, agreements were made with third countries in order to stem the migration flows. These agreements effectively externalised migration control beyond the borders of Europe. In this comparative case study, the bilateral migration control agreements between Italy and Libya, and between Spain and Morocco are analysed, with the aim of assessing the impact of these agreements on the human rights of migrants residing in North Africa. The study suggests that through the bilateral agreements, externalisation of migration control is facilitated, which in turn has resulted in a crackdown on irregular migration, with severe consequences for the perception and treatment of irregular migrants in North Africa.","['externalisation of migration control', 'irregular migration', 'bilateral agreements', 'human rights', 'European migration crisis', 'Libya', 'Morocco']"

(Stefano)']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"If one attempts to understand colonialist thinking, a very fruitful approach can be found in the analysis of “colonial discourse”.2 As colonialism itself is connected to the “mentality” of the colonizer, so must colonial violence be.3 As Kuss has noted, “The conduct by the German military of their colonial wars was affected by […] the domestic national discourse.”4 The genocide against the Herero and Nama of Namibia is certainly one of the darkest chapters of German history. Now, more than 100 years later, it is necessary to ask the right questions in order to avoid further harm and to address Germany’s colonial history and legacy in a meaningful way. In an attempt to do this, the analysis laid out in this paper aims at discussing the question “how were the Herero of Namibia constructed in German colonial discourse, 1900-1918?”, through an analysis of the discourse on the Herero found German colonial literature and anthropology. For this purpose, the works of Foucault, Said, and Kim are used throughout the paper. In the past, there was a long-standing “repression” of Germany’s colonial past and the country has only recently made an attempt at addressing its colonial heritage.5 As Schilling has argued, this development is vitally important since features of past discourses continue to influence the way Germany deals with its Others. An analysis of the colonial-era discourse on the Herero is therefore of practical value in the fight against structural injustices. Using two analytical frameworks, Said’s Orientalism and Kim’s borderlands, the paper supports the thesis that the discourse on the Herero in colonial Germany between 1900 and 1918 frames the Herero as the Orientalized and less-than-human Other.","['Herero', 'Genocide', 'German Colonialism', 'Namibia', 'Other', 'Orientalism', 'South West Africa']"

The Profitability of Occupation: The Political Economy of the Occupied West Bank,"Cirpka, Emma","['Henderson, Christian']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The aim of this study is to find out how the occupation in the West Bank is maintained by Israel, the Palestinian Authority, its capitalist class and the aid agencies with its donors. Hereby, the focus set upon the question what the neoliberal economic policies in the West Bank are and how they play a role in the occupation of it. To answer this question, the thesis will explore the policies of both Israel and the Palestinian Authority next to the policies that are promoted in the West Bank by aid agencies and international donors. Israel’s neoliberal economic policies will be explained through its economic interests in the West Bank, such as land, labour, water and market. Furthermore, the study will look into the neoliberal economic policies of the Palestinian Authority and how the Palestinian capitalist class has been created through these policies. Lastly, the study will highlight the role of international donors and aid agencies in the West Bank and the means in which they apply their influence to promote neoliberal economic policies that sustain the occupation of the West Bank. The study will show that the neoliberal economic policies in the West Bank contribute to its occupation and its dependency on the Israeli economy and international aid. However, not only Israel profits from the occupation, but also the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian elite through their cooperation with Israel.","['Israel', 'Palestine', 'Occupation', 'Middle East Peace Process', 'Political Economy', 'Palestinian Authority', 'West Bank', 'Neoliberalism', 'Aid Agencies', 'International Donors']"

The Impact of International Institutions at the Domestic Level: the Irish Abortion Law,"Warnders, Veerle","['Steen, Bart van der']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In an even more globalised world, the role of international institutions has become both increasingly important and controversial. The rise of global governance also has an impact for governance at the domestic level as many issues are decided, at least partly, at the international level. The question is, then, how great is this influence of international institutions at the domestic level? This thesis will explore this topic by doing a case study analysis that focuses on a specific issue, the Irish abortion law. The case study will focus on three instances in which Irish women sued the Irish state in the international courts for the suffering that the strict abortion law had caused them. The research question that will be used is ‘How did international institutions such as the United Nations and the European Union influence the abortion law in Ireland?’. This thesis’ hypothesis is that the executive power of international institutions at the domestic level is limited. Instead, the influence that international institutions have mainly flows from their ability to set international norms and standards. Through a qualitative document analysis of official court documents, court rulings, reports, and news articles, the impact of international institutions on the Irish abortion has been explored. Previous research on the practical impact of UN treaties and the concept of ‘soft power’ have been used as the foundation for the research. The main research findings are that the international institutions’ impact at the domestic level varies per domestic issue and context. Further, the hypothesis was correct in that the international institution’s involvement in the issue was considered legitimate due to its use of soft power. The final conclusion was that for the Irish abortion law specifically, an interplay of both international and domestic factors were needed for a change to be brought about.","['international institutions', 'United Nations', 'European Union', 'Ireland', 'Abortion law', 'soft power']"

Understanding the inequality of treatment of the IMF: What explains the different response of the IMF to the Argentine and Greek Crises?,"Minetto, Juan Francisco","['Broad, Matthew']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Argentine and Greek crises are very similar in their origin and nature, and both involved the intervention of the IMF. However, the way the IMF dealt with each one was different: it was stricter with Greece and more lenient with Argentina (until 2001). Nevertheless, no systematic comparison has been made between these two cases to explain the reasons for the IMF’s diverging reactions. This work is a qualitative study which employs the comparative method of difference to understand what explains the different response of the IMF to these crises. We take the three common factors which together can explain why the IMF operated as it did. These are: economic errors, the influence of other relevant actors, and reputational concerns. Firs, the Fund made economic errors in both crises, partly because it was misled by the opinions of its surroundings. The IMF undermined the importance of fiscal stringency in Argentina in the context of the currency peg while exaggerating the reach of the adjustment in Greece due to the misuse of analytical tools. Second, the influence of other relevant actors was not only limited to ideational issues but also consisted on direct intrusion. In Argentina, the US pressured the IMF through informal channels to be initially lenient with Argentina while in Greece the Fund was incorporated to an institutionalized lending entity which saw in austerity the only viable solution. Within this framework, individuals operated to further restrict the Fund’s room for maneuver in both cases. Lastly, the Fund’s reputational concerns -in Argentina the fact that its credibility was linked to the country’s success and in Greece the anxiety to be left out of that crisis- made the Fund continuously disburse loans in spite of lack of compliance of the former, whereas for the latter this fear made it accept any sort of arrangement, even if it meant extreme orthodoxy. We conclude that no factor exists in isolation and that it was their interplay what determined the Fund’s reaction, while acknowledging how decisive the influence of other actors in its decisions and the implications this has.",

Soft Power as a Political Tool: A case study of the effect of South Korean Hallyu on North Korean Society,"Marino, Nathalie de","['Mes, Thomas']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This essay aims to show how Hallyu (the South Korean Wave) can be considered a soft power tool, and to answer the question, “What have been the results of Hallyu’s influence on North Korean society?” By introducing the theory of ‘soft power’, I illustrate how Hallyu can be used as a political instrument. I use Chomsky’s ‘propaganda model’ and Elull’s concept of ‘horizontal propaganda’ in order to describe how North Korean society is structured by the Kim regime’s use of propaganda, and how this manufactures consent for the acceptance of social, economic and political policies. Furthermore, by using the ‘uses and gratification’ approach, and the ‘cultivation theory’ I explain the reasons for and effects of Hallyu consumption in North Korea. In doing so, I outline the opportunities and limits of Hallyu as a soft power tool. While the North Korean regime uses (the threat of) violence to maintain control of its citizens, there is also a large amount of public support that bolsters its power. The influence of Hallyu is contradicting the propaganda that is pervasive in North Korean society, thereby undermining consent. This in turn can lead to destabilizing the various institutions upon which the regime relies for influence and control. We cannot predict that this will occur, but we can identify a number of changes that we can relate to the influence of Hallyu.","['soft power', 'North Korea', 'inter-Korean relations', 'Hallyu (Korean Wave)', 'North Korean defectors', 'popular culture']"

Recent academic research has produced several prescriptions that indicate what aspects potentially successful counter-narrative, alternative narrative and government strategic communications programmes need to possess. Testing the scholarly recommendations on target audience, message, messenger and medium to the actual policies of Malaysia and Indonesia, it becomes apparent that the policies of both states are partially congruent with the dominant ideas in the literature. However, what both Malaysia and Indonesia lack is a clear delineation of target audiences based on level of radicalisation, the provision of alternative things to do to complement their alternative narrative programmes and a comprehensive strategy to combine online and offline measures to achieve the most sustainable effect. Still, when comparing the respective policies of the two states, it must be noted that Malaysia is more congruent with the scholarly prescriptions than Indonesia. The most important differences between the two states are that the Malaysian authorities showcase a more sophisticated awareness and application of the relevant academic definitions and take a rather comprehensive approach to providing government strategic communications, the latter of which is practically lacking in the case of Indonesia.","['counter-narratives', 'violent extremism', 'counter', 'narratives', 'Indonesia', 'Malaysia', 'terrorism', 'radicalisation', 'counter-messaging', 'alternative narratives', 'government strategic communications']"
Brazilian Gradualism vs Argentinean Shock Treatment,"Rooijakkers, Frederieke","['Amann, E.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The objective of this thesis is to identify and explain the similarities and differences between the anti-inflation strategies implemented in Brazil and Argentina, right after these countries returned to democracy in the 1980’s. The comparison between Argentina and Brazil is unique, because these countries share many similarities in their economic histories: they have been isolated from the world economy during most of the 20th century, build up high external debts, experienced years of heavy military repression and suffered from hyperinflation. Additionally, the first democratic presidents, Alfonsín in Argentina and Sarney in Brazil, faced many challenges. They had to rebuild the state democracy, service the high external debt, and end the deeply-rooted inflation at the same time. Argentina and Brazil suffered from high inflation levels during most of the 20th century. Because of the indexation of the economy, the populations of the two countries were able to live hand-in hand with the high inflation rates for decades. This changed in the 1980’s, when inflation targeting became the most important point on the agendas of the new democratic governments. After the launch of the Austral Plan (1985) in Argentina and Cruzado plan in Brazil (1986), inflation and indexation were abolished immediately. This first objective of this thesis is to explain why the first democratic governments in the 1980’s introduced these shock-treatments in order to end inflation. Additionally, there are several important differences between the heterodox anti-inflation strategies that were introduced by the first democratic governments. In general, Argentina’s Austral Plan seemed more ‘aggressive’ and ‘ambitious’ compared to Brazil’s Cruzado Plan. Therefore, the second purpose of this thesis is to explain where these differences derive from. The main conclusion is that the choice for a heterodox shock-treatment is connected to the inertial nature of the high inflation rates: the first democratic presidents saw no other option than to implement heterodox inflation-targeting programs right after they took office. Also, this thesis argues that Alfonsín and Sarney’s choice for heterodox shock-treatment is related to the democratic model. Heterodox and orthodox approaches have different effects on society: orthodox inflation-stabilization policies cause economic recession right after the implementation. This is not the case with heterodox shock-treatment, and in order to gain political support, it was more beneficial for these governments to implement heterodox inflation-targeting policies. Furthermore, this difference can be explained by the fact that the shock-therapies were implemented under different circumstances: the Argentinean economy was in deep economic recession when the Austral plan was implemented in 1985. In contrast, the Brazilian economy was expending at the time of the implementation of the Cruzado plan. Second, in contrast to Brazil, Argentina aimed to restore its relationship with the IMF by introducing aggressive fiscal restrictions.","['Inflation Stabilization', 'Austral Plan', 'Cruzado Plan', 'shock-treatment']"
Understanding Russia's annexation of Crimea: A perspective through Strategic Culture Analysis,"Mulder, Patrick","['Bader, Max']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The annexation of Crimea by Russia, which took place on the 18th of March 2014, is widely regarded to be one of the most impactful events which occurred in the past decade. This event, which took place after the so-called Ukrainian revolution, remains of significant interest to researchers who seek to understand why Russia undertook such an action. Such research is partially hindered by a lack of open access to documents and other sources related to the annexation. In that regard, this thesis is not exactly novel. It too seeks to understand why Russia annexed Crimea. In order to realize that goal, this research utilizes a methodology originating from the field of strategic culture analysis (SCA). This methodology, as originally formulated by Edward Lock, suggests that the researcher maps common ideas regarding strategic culture which can be derived from sources such as public statements, interviews and speeches. Following analysis, the researcher is then able to formulate how these common ideas might influence strategic behavior. Utilizing this approach results in findings which suggest that Russia’s annexation of Crimea was an opportunistic act, driven by external factors such as Russia’s distrust for the West and its fear for NATO, as well as its desire to hold a firm grip on Sevastopol’s naval base.","['Crimea', 'Russia', 'Strategic culture analysis', 'Putin', 'Ukraine', 'Ukrainian revolution', 'NATO', 'Sevastopol']"
De vormen van schizofrenie in Mr Robot (2015-),"Uitentuis, Jan","['Hesselberth, Pepita']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Film- en literatuurwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De scriptie wat u zo zal lezen heeft betrekking op de verschillende vormen van schizofrenie die de Amerikaanse postmoderne tv-serie Mr Robot (2015-) kenmerken. De serie gaat over de mentaal instabiele hacker Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek) die door middel van zijn expertise in hacken een virtuele revolutie in gang zet om de wereld volgens hem een betere plek te maken. Net als in de film Fight Club (1999) heeft het hoofdpersonage te maken met een andere persoonlijkheid (namelijk Mr Robot, gespeeld door Christian Slater) wiens aard op het eerste gezicht niet kenbaar is voor zowel het personage als de kijker; je ziet de andere persoonlijkheid aanvankelijk als een ander personage en niet als een onderdeel van de hoofdpersoon. Hier is dan al sprake van een onbetrouwbaarheid; de serie is niet gemakkelijk te duiden en als kijker moet je een bepaalde kijkhouding aannemen die eerder leidt tot de “waarheid”, voor zover daar sprake van is. Een aantal intrigerende kenmerken die de serie bevat is bijvoorbeeld het onduidelijke ziektebeeld van Elliot, de grote hoeveelheid intertekstuele verwijzingen naar eerdere (klassieke) werken, het gebruik van een “unreliable narrator” (wat ruimte biedt voor interpretatie en grootschalige discussies op het internet genereert) en het heterogene karakter van de serie op het gebied van genre, editing en cinematografie zijn allemaal kenmerken die mij als kijker en fan aanspreken. Met deze scriptie ga ik dus in op deze interessante kenmerken en tracht ik aan te tonen dat er op meerdere niveaus sprake is van een bepaalde vorm van schizofrenie binnen de serie Mr Robot. Hierbij doel ik op klinisch en cultureel niveau en ook op het niveau van de kijker. Daarnaast zal ik ook een poging wagen om een verwevenheid te vinden die deze niveaus met elkaar verbindt. De onderzoeksvraag luidt dan als volgt: In welke vormen komt schizofrenie voor in de serie Mr Robot en op welke manier zijn de vormen in elkaar verweven? Op wetenschappelijk niveau is er (nog) niet bijzonder veel geschreven over de serie en vooral met betrekking tot de specifieke onderzoeksvraag. In deze scriptie maak ik onder andere gebruik van het werk van Thomas Elsaesser, Fredric Jameson, Richard Dyer, Jean Baudrillard, Seymour Chatman, Peter Verstraten, Shoshana Felman en Dori Laub.","['schizofrenie', 'productieve pathologie', 'culturele schizofrenie', 'pastiche', 'postmodernisme', 'traumatheorie', 'kijkhouding']"

The political challenges to combat malnutrition Analysis of food security policy in Guatemala,"Van der Heide, Susanne","['Valdivia Rivera, Soledad']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Latijns-Amerikastudies (BA),Master thesis,en,"This study provides a critical analysis to the issue of malnutrition in Guatemala by looking at the constraints of national food security policy. Even though there are a number of programs and strategies designed to tackle malnutrition, it is found that they are often not implemented nor executed. This thesis suggests that this can be attributed to weak institutionalism, such as a lack of capacity, coherence and strength, present throughout multiple levels of the national food security and nutrition system (SINASAN). This research first analyses this problem from a historical perspective by examining the high levels of poverty and inequality which are deeply rooted into Guatemalan history and society. A state of food insecurity, a state in which malnutrition is more likely to emerge, is worsened when there is a lack of accessibility and availability to food resulting from income poverty and inequality. This directly implies that levels of malnutrition can only be reduced if poverty and inequality are also tackled. This complexity to the issue of malnutrition is, and will stay, an enormous obstacle for political institutions in creating sustainable and efficient food security programs and policies. Noticeably, weak institutionalism in Guatemala increases this barrier. Namely, a lack of continuity in government administrations leads to temporary and inconsistent food security strategies and excessive bureaucracy, a lack of coordination and structure withhold the proper implementation of food security projects from national level to local level. In other words, this study exposes that Guatemala finds itself in a vicious cycle which delays the reduction of malnutrition.","['food security', 'public policies', 'Guatemala', 'malnutrition', 'political institutions']"

"Wild scenes at the stadium? Protest as political culture during Shanghai's international sporting events, 1924-1941","Becker, Nathalie","['Stolte, Carolien', 'Nie, Hongping']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Sport is never just a game. In an imperial context, it connotes a host of ideals and values directly linked to foreign political authority. In treaty port Shanghai, competition between the city’s many national communities was similarly conceived of as a tool to strengthen foreign power. The practice of protest at international sports events by Shanghai’s Chinese population subverted these attempts and enabled protestors to undermine foreign legitimacy. This thesis applies the lens of political culture to examine how meaning was attached to protest at international sporting events and analyse how this was received by Shanghai’s foreign community. Sport has frequently been overlooked in the wider historiography of protest. However, an investigation of the practice of sports protest is highly relevant for providing valuable insights into the nature of social relations. While historians have generally assumed that Shanghai’s foreign society was insular, studying protest shows not only that there was significant contact, but that this was exploited for political aims. Sport provided a unique avenue for protest by encapsulating foreign rituals of rule, which could be spontaneously usurped to mount a symbolic challenge. Comparison with formal colonial contexts illustrates that sport as a channel for protest was shaped by Shanghai’s semi-colonial arrangement, illuminating the broader complexities and vulnerabilities of semi-colonial control.","['Shanghai', 'Protest', 'China', 'Political Culture', 'Semi-colonialsim', 'Imperialism', 'Sport']"

Constructieve Journalistiek bij Omroep West EEN KWALITATIEF ONDERZOEK NAAR CONSTRUCTIEVE TEKSTELEMENTEN IN DE NIEUWSBERICHTGEVING,"Dekker, Willemijn","['Pleijter, A.R.J.', 'Koetsenruijter, A.W.M.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Deze masterscriptie is geschreven tijdens de master Journalistiek & Nieuwe Media. Het onderzoek wordt verricht voor Omroep West, de regionale publieke omroep voor het noordelijke gedeelte van Zuid-Holland. In 2017 is het medium gestart met het publiceren van constructieve nieuwsberichten om op die manier de zogeheten ‘nieuwsmijders’ weer bij het nieuws te betrekken. Maar hoe krijgt constructieve journalistiek dan vorm in de nieuwsberichten? Na bestudering van vakliteratuur over constructieve journalistiek en praktische toepassingen van constructieve journalistiek wordt er middels een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse antwoord gegeven op de vraag: Hoe krijgen constructieve verhaalelementen concreet vorm in de online berichtgeving van Omroep West?’. In dit onderzoek worden onder andere theorieën van Catherine Gyldensted, Karen McIntyre en Ulrik Haagerup, de ‘grondleggers’ van de constructieve journalistiek, aangehaald, om een globaal beeld te schetsen van hoe constructieve journalistiek in de vakliteratuur omschreven wordt. Daarnaast worden er praktische toepassingen van onder andere Hermans & Gyldensted (2018) en Smouter (2018) beschreven die laten zien hoe constructieve journalistiek en constructieve verhaalelementen er dan vervolgens in de praktijk uit moeten zien. Na de literatuurverkenning wordt er middels een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse onderzoek verricht naar hoe constructieve verhaalelementen vorm krijgen in de online nieuwsberichtgeving van Omroep West. De thema’s die tijdens de analyse centraal staan komen uit de HOUVAST-methode van Smouter (2018) en zijn constructieve verhaalelementen die hoopvol, opbouwend, uitdagend, verhelderend, activerend, samenwerkend en transparant van aard zijn. Volgens Gyldensted (2011) en McIntyre (2015) is constructieve journalistiek een vorm van journalistiek met een positieve insteek die perspectief-verbredende, toekomst- en oplossingsgerichte elementen includeert. Na de analyse kan geconcludeerd worden dat constructieve verhaalelementen op verschillende manieren vorm krijgen in de online nieuwsberichtgeving van Omroep West. Ten eerste krijgen de elementen vorm door het gebruik van bepaalde narratieven. Het restorative narrative en de peak-end story worden voornamelijk gebruikt om positieve emoties op te roepen. Ten tweede krijgen de elements of well-being uit het PERMA-model vorm doordat er wordt ingegaan op prestaties, verbondenheid, relaties en betekenissen. Verder lijken de rubriek Rake Vragen en het meldpunt beiden geschikte manieren om constructieve nieuwsberichten te construeren. Het publiek raakt hierdoor geactiveerd om onderwerpen aan te dragen en voelt zich daardoor wellicht meer verbonden met het medium. Daarnaast dragen deze twee rubrieken bij aan het creëren van meer behulpzaamheid binnen de journalistiek. Tot slot kan er geconcludeerd worden dat constructieve verhaalelementen voornamelijk vorm krijgen door het scheppen van verheldering in ingewikkelde onderwerpen door het beiden van context in toegankelijke taal.","['framing', 'constructieve journalistiek', 'narratieven']"

This study aims to establish a direct connection between Michelle Obama’s use of African American Language and her public image, based on a sentiment analysis of tweets. Building on existing work, this study asks how Michelle Obama’s African American Language use affects her public image and whether public perception is based on her use of AAL. In this context, the archaic use of African American Vernacular English is substituted with the use of African American Language. Based on a corpus of gathered tweets, a sentiment analysis was performed to determine online engagement based on mood. An analysis of the results demonstrated that positive online engagement could be connected to a decreased use of African American Language by Michelle Obama. The results indicate that Americans think more highly of Michelle when she speaks less “black.”","['Michelle Obama', 'African American Language', 'Twitter', 'Style Shifting', 'Prejudice', 'Public Image']"
Conscience & Connections. Marcellus Franckheim (1587-1644) and his contacts in the Habsburg World at the eve of the Thirty Years War.,"Tuinstra, Willemijn","['Duindam, J.F.J.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Dutch glassmaker’s son and rector of the Latin school in Zutphen, Marcellus Franckheim (Zutphen 1587- Dunkirk 1644), converted from Calvinism to Catholicism in 1614 and became secretary to Cardinal Melchior Khlesl at the court of the Habsburg Emperor Matthias. He ended his life as councillor to the Spanish King Philip IV in the admiralty of the Flanders fleet. By analysing Franckheim’s surviving correspondence and publications, this thesis shows that while Franckheim’s life on first sight seems full of unexpected moves and change, there is a remarkable continuity in his faith, his contacts and his opinions. It also shows that the Dutch Gomarist-Arminian controversy during the Twelve Years Truce directly influenced his decision to convert and that a group of engaged Zutphen Catholic citizens connected him to the Counter-Reformation world of the Habsburg courts in Europe. Using Marcellus Franckheim as an exemplary case, this thesis addresses the broader question of how Dutch Catholics in the early seventeenth century, both in the Low Countries and in exile, participated in local and transnational networks to promote and consolidate their faith. It also provides insight in the interconnectedness of the political and religious conflicts in the Low Countries and the Holy Roman Empire, in particular with regard to the ways in which individuals felt involved and tried to influence these events.","['conversion', 'Dutch Catholic engagement', 'Habsburg courts', 'Eighty Years War', 'Thirty Years War', 'Counter-Reformation', 'Ordo Militiae Christianae', 'Sodality of Christian Defence', 'Society of Jesus']"

In general, pronounced effects of both neoliberalism and decentralization is a change in the approach to governance. With the drastic attitudes of states toward the economy and social-policy making caused by neoliberal reform, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have become actors of increasing importance. Subsequently, worldwide decentralization trends, most notably in the 1990s, have moved NGOs to assume new roles as active social service-deliverers and co-workers of development. When looking at Chile, major political shifts occurred with its return to democracy. Nonetheless, the neoliberal model implemented under Pinochet has always stayed.

Inhabiting the Environment through Art: the work of Dan Graham and Olafur Eliasson in Inhotim Institute as Instances of Environmental Aesthetics,"Baldissarelli Bremm, Alessandra","['Shobeiri, Ali']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the role of the environment in the artworks of Dan Graham and Olafur Eliasson in Inhotim Institute of Contemporary Art and Botanical Gardens, in Brazil. This is done from the perspective of Environmental Aesthetics, which is the theoretical frame that allows the consideration of the environment not only as a subject matter for contemporary art. Rather, the important contributions of philosopher Arnold Berleant and Allen Carlson in the field, acknowledge our understanding and engagement with the environment as intrinsic elements of the aesthetic experience. Therefore, this thesis looks not only to the materiality of Dan Graham’s Bisected triangle, Interior curve (2002), and Olafur Eliasson’s Viewing Machine (2001-2003). It also sees the constitution of the relationship between the viewer, the artworks and the environment in Inhotim Institute as constituent parts of how we perceive them. By emphasizing the active relationality in/with the environment, the scope of this research is extended beyond the traditional foundations of aesthetics as, for instance, the idea of the contemplation of a landscape, the subjectivity of the viewer, and the pleasure associated with beauty. Finally, this thesis shows that when perceiving natural environments in relation to art we are invited to enter a space in which our perception is always in movement between our cultural beliefs, the environmental conditions that affect us and the artwork. In engaging in/with the environment in the aesthetic experience, Dan Graham and Olafur Eliasson offer us ways of disrupting our accustomed view, enlarging our experience in the world, and bringing art closer to the everyday life.","['Environmental Aesthetics', 'Dan Graham', 'Olafur Eliasson', 'Inhotim Institute of Contemporary Art', 'Engagement', 'Viewing Machine', 'Bisected triangle', 'Interior curve', 'Environment', 'Arnold Berleant', 'Allen Carlson']"
The Impact of Neoliberal Reforms on Female Entrepreneurs in the Middle East and North Africa,"Sander, Karen","['Henderson, Christian']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The exclusion of women from the economy results in a country loses labour force and hampers its (potential) economic development and prosperity. Nevertheless, the participation rates of women in the market are often much lower than those of men, especially in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Women face socio-cultural barriers that restrict their individual freedoms in several areas, for instance their access to education and the (global) market. Their subordinated role towards men is established in various aspects of life: society, economy and politics. At the same time, MENA countries are facing challenges imposed by high youth unemployment and the need to catch up with the global economic progress to stay competitive. Diversification of the economy is one of the main goals in order to keep up with the global economic developments. Diversification means also including more women into the labour market since they often approach challenges of the market different than men.Neoliberal reforms intend to increase the competitiveness of a market by making it accessible for everyone. The claim that I want to investigate is that neoliberalism impacts on the (economic) opportunities of women within the socio-cultural context of their countries. In other words, how do neoliberal reforms impact on female entrepreneurship in the Middle East and North Africa?","['Neoliberalism', 'Female Entrepreneurs', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Gendered Labour Practices', 'Middle East and North Africa (MENA)']"

Speaker-specific information in the acoustic characteristics of English fricatives,"Carralero Fernandez, Sara","['Heeren, Willemijn']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"There is still much to learn about speakers’ similarities and differences in the field of Forensic Phonetics, especially with respect to consonant acoustics. The present master’s thesis presents analyses of acoustic features of three sibilants /s, z, ʃ/ in British English. It focuses on analysing the static and dynamic features of those segments to see if they can cue speaker-specific information. The analyses have been carried out on twenty male speakers from the DyViS corpus. This research focuses on both static features (intensity, centre of gravity, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis) and dynamic features (centre of gravity depending of F2 vowel onset and offset) from speaker-specific perspective. The results obtained demonstrate the high speaker-specificity of centre of gravity, standard deviation and intensity. However, we have to be careful with the last one, because it is dependent on the recording circumstances. As for skewness and kurtosis, they show speaker-specificity for /z/, but results are weaker for /s/ and /ʃ/. This master’s thesis has shown that spectral and acoustic properties of the three sibilants analysed /s, z, ʃ/ in English present promising results regarding speaker-specificity.","['speaker-specificity', 'sibilants', 'FSC', 'dynamic features', 'static features']"

Thucydides’s Trap: Exploring the Development of the United States-China Relations,"Assous, Yaëlle","['Thakur, Vineet']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Due to its important economic growth China has become, over the 21st century, an important actor on the international stage. Today, China is said to be undermining the American hegemon which has been leading the international system since the end of the Cold War. The Thucydides’s Trap analogy of Graham Allison predicts that a war between both powers is “more likely than not” (Allison 2017b). This thesis explores the existence of this trap and the implications for the relationship between the United States and China. For this purpose, this thesis performs a qualitative analysis through the in-depth review of Allison’s analogy and takes a deductive approach by testing it on post-World War II circumstances. The conclusions of this inquiry are then applied to the power shift between the United States and China. The analysis discloses that there is no such thing as a trap as argued by Allison. Moreover, the findings reveal that Allison overlooks the developments of the current world order which make the Thucydides’s Trap inapplicable to the power shift between the United States and China. Subsequently, Allison’s methodological tool is deemed to be analytically weak and the form of determinism arising from his analogy is conjectural.","['Thucydides’s Trap', 'United States', 'China', 'Graham Allison', 'War', 'International Relations']"
The Communicative Orientation of Classrooms where Dutch is Taught as a Second Language,"Rahmeh, Samah","['de Jong, Nivja']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The current study aimed to pinpoint some of the factors underlying the communication difficulties faced by Arabic-speaking immigrants learning Dutch as a second language (L2). To this end, six classrooms where Dutch is taught as L2 were selected in order to investigate the level of the communicative orientation they foster. Part A of the COLT coding scheme (Fröhlich et al., 1985) was slightly modified and used for the classroom observations. That part of the scheme describes classroom events at the level of activity and contains categories related to participant organization, student modality, content and materials. The materials that seemed to highly control the classroom activities were also analysed in terms of their communicative orientation and in terms of the type and length of output they require from students. The results of the classroom observations revealed that that the communicative orientation was different among the six classes observed. It was minimal at some classes where the teacher was the dominant speaker and the sole controller of the topics discussed. Contrastively, students were passive learners who provided short, prescribed answers without involving in any kind of discussion. Classes with a minimal level of communicativeness were also characterized by being form-focused with minimal integration of meaning and by being highly controlled by the course materials. Other classes fostered the communicative competence at a moderate level. At these classes students were limitedly active, the integration of meaning was higher and group/pair discussion was present. The third type of classes observed was highly communicative. At these classes teachers and learners alike involved in open discussion and they both determined the topics to be discussed. Most of these topics were of broad reference. The analysis of the materials ascertained that the course books used were not communicatively oriented as they stimulate limited output from learners; both in terms of type and length. Nevertheless, a shift in the communicative orientation towards the more communicative end was traced throughout the two books.","['COLT coding scheme', 'communicative competence', 'active role', 'orientation', 'type of output', 'length of output']"

White American Anti-Agonism Towards African American Agonistic and Antagonistic Protest,"Vanblarcum, Michaela","['Polak, Sara']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The agon is the democratic political arena in which all social groups are meant to participate in. Historically, however, certain social groups have been systematically denied this access to the agon. Using Chantal Mouffe's theory of agonism and antaongism I will explore a new term, anti-agonism, to demonstrate how certain groups violently deny other groups this access. The two key periods involved are political protests surrounding Selma (1965) as well as key protests surrounding Ferguson (2014). Anti-agonism is always based on the othering and dehumanization of others, in this case it is othering of African Americans by White Americans, specifically police and state officials. This framing of African Americans as the Other allows for anti-agonism to thrive. This paper aims to reframe the conflict, illustrating that the problem is not whether disenfranchised social groups attempt to access the agon peacefully or through violence, but the response to that is problematic. While disenfranchised groups are othered, it remains difficult for them to partake in the political arena.","['anti-agonism', 'agonism', 'antagonism', 'Chantal Mouffe', 'African American', 'White fragility', 'police brutality', 'racism', 'othering', 'dehumanization']"
Descriptions of figure-ground relationships by native Dutch speakers: influences of language and attention,"Vollebregt, Inge Arwen","['Parafita Couto, Maria del Carmen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In order to find out more about figure-ground relationships in motion events, the central question for this study was whether describing a figure-ground motion event influences the degree to which participants remember a video. Choi, Goller, Hong, Ansorge and Yun (2018) found a difference between German and Korean speakers with regard to how they encode different aspects of figure-ground relationships in their speech. This study aims to build on the findings of Choi et al. (2018) and make a small contribution to the question how figure-ground relationships are encoded in speakers’ minds in different languages. To investigate this, 54 target videos were created, divided over 9 different categories that all depicted a different motion type. Two versions of each video were created, one depicting a canonical direction of motion and the other a reverse direction. In the first part of the experiment, the description task, two groups of participants were given a different task. The motion description group (18 participants, L1 Dutch, 16 participants L2 English, 2 participants L2 French, Bulgarian and/or Japanese) was asked to describe the motions they saw in a video, the object description group (24 participants, L1 Dutch, L2 English, 10 participants L2 French, German, Italian and/or Swedish) got the task to describe the objects. Participants filled out a language background questionnaire during part two, the intermission, and in part three, the recall task, participants from both groups had to judge whether they had seen a video during the first part or not. For each category in the recall task there were 2 true videos (videos participants had seen before in the description task) and 4 deviant videos (videos they had not seen before in the description task). A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted for which proportion correct, category type, exposure status (true or deviant), canonicity (canonical or reverse) and participant group (motion or object description) were entered as variables. The results showed that while there was no difference between the groups, there were differences between the put over/under category and the hook category, the put on loose support and the put through category, the put on tight attachment and put through, and the put through and hook category, and whether the videos were true or deviant. I conclude that these factors influence the amount of correct judgments the participants make and discuss what the implications for these conclusions might be in the context of the influence of language on cognition.","['Figure-ground relationships', 'Motion events', 'Manner', 'Path', 'Dutch', 'Verb-framed languages', 'Satellite-framed languages']"
Going Once... Going Twice... Sold! Revisiting the 1988 Sotheby's Auction in Soviet Moscow,"Montalvo, Abigail","['Boele, Otto']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis revisits the 1988 Sotheby’s auction in Moscow, an event that catalyzed the commercialization of the Soviet art market. For the first time in history, unofficial art, previously outlawed by the Soviet state, was auctioned off to predominantly Western buyers. While scholars have assessed the role of the auction in transforming the Soviet art market, none have contemplated the perceptions of commercialization from the perspective of the media. Additionally, pre-existing literature lacks application of cultural theory. Therefore, this thesis departs from previous works by assessing Western and Soviet news coverage of the event. Based on the conclusions drawn from this analysis, Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of symbolic capital is applied in order to understand the ‘re-shuffling of artistic hierarchies.’ By drawing on media- and theory-focused lenses, this thesis aims to contribute to the discussion on the nature of commercialization in the Soviet Union prior to its collapse, as well as invite a more careful reading on the effects of commercialization on Soviet artistic production.","[""Sotheby's"", 'art market', 'perestroika', 'commercialization', 'Pierre Bourdieu', 'symbolic capital', 'auction']"

Securitization of the Refugee Crisis: Security for Whom?,"Canzi, Arianna","['Ennis, Crystal']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"“The ongoing rise of securitized discourses have completely changed the political landscape of European politics. Especially when dealing with the refugee crisis, the European Union and member states have taken a strong stance towards border management and operational security, mainly based on the state security model. This approach has been deemed controversial, especially in the case of the Central Mediterranean Corridor, due to the consequences it has had, and still currently has on the safety of those attempting to cross the sea. Moreover, in order to show the origin and further complications this approach has, the Central Mediterranean Corridor will be analyzed as case study, and the colonial past between Italy and Libya, main destination and transit countries of this corridor, will be investigated. The research carried out in this paper aims to question this approach and to show the fallouts it has on the security of humans. By analyzing stipulated policies and said fallouts, this research will show how the state security model is obsolete when dealing with the refugee crisis, and it will present an alternative framework for migratory policies, embodied in the human security model.”","['Migration governance', 'Securitization', 'Refugee crisis', 'Human Security', 'Frontex']"

Genocide and International Criminal Justice: Consistencies and Inconsistencies,"Holmes, William","['Vodopivec, Maja']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis posits that the term “genocide” and the ‘Genocide Convention’ have been inconsistently used by the international community since the term entered the international law vocabulary and the convention entered into force. Within this, some mass killings appear to fulfil the convention’s criteria, but they are not defined as genocide by the international criminal justice system i.e. the actor that best placed in this community to authoritatively do so, due to its supposed impartiality. This research aims to answer why this is the case. To do so, it first outlines the history of the term genocide and its (historical) role in international criminal justice. Next, it analyses the Genocide Convention and answers why some mass killings are defined as genocide. It does so via an analysis of the avenues through which international criminal justice has been – and can be – pursued, and their cases. This thesis then engages in most-similar case study analyses of various mass killings in Rwanda (1994) and the former Yugoslavia (1995). Accordingly, it argues that some mass killings are not defined as genocide partly because of: the requirement of domestic and international) political will for trying mass killings as genocide(s) and; political interests. In other words, the international criminal justice system is inconsistent when defining mass killings as genocide because it is susceptible to the political will and interests of myriad stakeholders in the international community.","['International Criminal Justice', 'Genocide', 'Consistency', 'Inconsistency']"
"DIAL/RINGUISTICS Τhe opposition between /l/ and /r/ in the diasystem of Vedic Sanskrit. A study in diachronic linguistics, dialectology and sociolinguistics.","Schoubben, Niels","['Lubotsky, Alexander']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, the long-standing problem in Indo-Iranian linguistics whether or not to reconstruct a phoneme /l/ for Proto-Indo-Iranian is examined in detail. After a brief status quaestionis, the etymology of all words with a phoneme /l/ in Ṛgvedic Sanskrit is scrutinized to see which words are likely borrowed from substratum languages and which go back to Proto-Indo-Iranian. Secondly, the problem is studied from a synchronic perspective. On the basis of the distribution of /l/ and /r/ in the different books of the Ṛgveda, it is argued that both diachronic and diatopic factors play a role, i.e. that generally speaking later books and books written in more eastern parts of India have a higher frequency of words with /l/. Finally, the diastratic component is taken into consideration as it is shown on the basis of a semantic analysis and with attention to female speech that /l/ was part of the lower registers of Vedic Sanskrit. This evidence combined, it is argued in the conclusion that /l/ gradually lost its function as a phoneme in Proto-Indo-Iranian, a process that was completed in Old Iranian and Mitanni Indo-Aryan with the complete loss of a phoneme /l/. This, however, was interrupted in Old Indo-Aryan, due to a profound influx of substratum words with the phoneme /l/.","['Vedic Sanskrit', 'Etymology', 'historical sociolinguistics', 'contact linguistics']"

The conflict between the Uyghurs and the Chinese reaches far into the shared history, but it has accelerated after the events of 9/11 which created a new discourse on terrorism in China. This study aims to create a better understanding of the conflict by researching the conflict as objectively as possible. The question that will guide this thesis is: To what extent does the Chinese definition of terrorism and the perceived threat of the Uyghurs align with the counterterror measures taken in comparison to counterterror measures employed by a number of Western nations? To answer the question, the Chinese definition of terrorism has been compared to an academic definition, along with a research on the Uyghur threat, and an analysis of the counterterror measures of China in comparison to the Netherlands and France. While the Chinese definitions is too broad, Uyghur terrorist organizations do form a threat, and the Chinese counterterror measures are not too different from France due to the securitization process, both countries have gone through. The thesis concludes that counterterror measures are valid in the light of the perceived threat due to the issue being securitized.","['PRC', 'Uyghurs', 'Terrorism', 'Counterterrorism', 'Securitization', 'Islam']"

E Pluribus Unum?

In this pre-colonial timeframe, strife over resources determined the prevailing status quo between local groups, while foreigners increasingly started to exert influence over sociopolitical and socio-economic arrangements as well. There are important continuities between this timeframe and the subsequent eras (1885–1915, when the territory was part of the German colony of Deutsch Südwestafrika; and 1919–1990, when the territory was known as the South African-controlled Mandate State of South West Africa); and numerous structures and traditions that are rooted in the pre-colonial period, still have an impact on Namibian society today. Even so, the pre-colonial timeframe (1840–1890) is largely being neglected in the historical representations in Namibian society today. Instead, Namibians and foreign visitors alike get confronted with an incomplete and manipulated image of Namibian national history: a ‘preferred image’ that is tightly connected to the nation building project of the SWAPO Party, Namibia’s ruling political party. In this thesis, the (pre-colonial) past is being connected to the current state of historical and sociopolitical affairs in the Republic of Namibia, to discover how and why the situation described above came into being.","['history', 'namibia', 'pre-colonial history', 'memory politics', 'politics', 'south west africa', 'SWAPO']"

The Conflict in the De Facto State of Transnistria: Explaining the Current Progress,"Povazan, Martin","['Skalamera, Morena']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The aim of this thesis is to examine why was progress in the Transnistrian conflict achieved after 2016 considering that all the previous efforts of internal as well as external actors after the ceasefire agreement proved to be unsuccessful. The thesis applies conflict management and mediation theory, which claims that progress in a conflict is possible when a “ripe moment” arises as a result of Mutually Hurting Stalemate (MHS). The “ripe moment” has to be seized either by the parties themselves or by a mediator, with a problem-solving approach being particularly useful to that end. Based on the review of existing academic literature, the author identifies three hypotheses (the “political agency hypothesis”, the “economic hypothesis”, and the “mediation hypothesis”), which offer alternative explanations why the progress was achieved specifically after 2016. The hypotheses are tested using the qualitative method of process tracing. The systematic analysis of the diagnostic evidence reveals that the progress was not achieved due to the new Moldovan and Transnistrian presidents coming to power at the end of 2016. In 2016, the “ripe moment” arose in the Transnistrian conflict as a result of the poor economic performance of both Moldova and Transnistria, which created the situation of MHS. Moreover, the united position of mediators in the 5+2 format combined with the focus on smaller, practical questions, allowed the “ripe moment” to be seized and thus progress was achieved.","['Transnistria', 'Moldova', 'De Facto States', 'Conflict Management and Mediation', 'Protracted Conflicts']"

Se realizó una semblanza de la administración de Carlos Menem, notoria por haber estado atravesada por escándalos de corrupción, y de la figura de los periodistas argentinos más importantes de su historia como es el caso de Rodolfo Walsh.

Se prestó atención a la función del periodismo de investigación durante ese periodo y se analizaron los escándalos de corrupción ocurridos en aquellos años. Además se caracterizó su círculo íntimo y los roles que muchos de ellos tuvieron en distintos escándalos de corrupción. Junto a la bibliografía se incorporaron opiniones e ideas de numerosos expertos en el tema, principalmente periodistas de investigación. De esta manera se construyó el análisis empírico. Se revisó y se trató de dar respuesta a la pregunta principal (¿En qué grado el periodismo de investigación se ha constituido en el principal instrumento y actor en la denuncia de corrupción en Argentina?) y verificar la hipótesis (El periodismo investigativo ha jugado y sigue jugando un papel muy importante a la hora de develar la verdad en Argentina. Aunque en ese rol puede llegar a suplir las deficiencias del Poder Judicial, no es capaz de reemplazarlo por completo en sus tareas). A la hora de las entrevistas todos los expertos coinciden en este punto. No hay quién niegue el importantísimo rol del periodismo de investigación en Argentina. A su vez, ninguno de ellos cree que el periodismo pueda o deba reemplazar al Poder Judicial. El periodismo cumple un rol de control de los poderes y como “guardián” de la verdad se ocupa de echar luz sobre aquello que los poderes quieren que permanezca en las sombras. Ahora bien, no significa que por esto debe instituirse en una suerte de Poder Judicial. El periodismo debe investigar al Poder Judicial también. Es por esto que no puede actuar cómo Poder Judicial, juez o fiscal. Es verdad que, como señaló Lagos (2013), en muchos caso el periodismo puede reemplazar al Poder Judicial allí donde este fracase, por inoperancia o por corrupción, pero reemplazarlo no sería la solución. El Cuarto Poder resulta un agregado necesario en el equilibrio de poderes en Argentina ante una judicatura débil y la corrupción devenida en un mal endémico. Con García Lucero me pregunto, “¿cómo fue posible que el periodismo fuera y siga siendo el discurso más creíble (2000)?” Hemos visto que, aún después de tantos escándalos que se hicieron públicos en Argentina, especialmente durante el mandato de los Kirchner, el Poder Judicial todavía no parece ser capaz de enjuiciar a los responsables. Como señaló Daniel Santoro, el aparato Judicial parece estar empezando a actuar más adecuadamente, pero los círculos íntimos de poder permanecen casi intocables. El crecimiento en importancia del periodismo investigativo es una tendencia común a toda América Latina. Hasta que los gobiernos en Argentina sean capaces de combatir la corrupción, el periodismo de investigación tendrá un papel crucial. Por el momento, parece ser la mejor manera de llegar a la justicia. La corrupción es, posiblemente, el mal, o uno de los mayores males de la Argentina. Atraviesa toda su historia, se puede reconocer en cada gobierno, lo podemos encontrar a niveles escandalosos durante la gestión Kirchner pero también lo podemos encontrar en la gestión actual de Mauricio Macri. No hay una solución que resuelva el problema de raíz. El periodismo de investigación solo ha acelerado los tiempos de reacción, pero no puede prevenirlo.","['Corrupción', 'Periodismo de investigación', 'Poder Judicial', 'Gobierno', 'Cultura política', 'Estado de derecho', 'Kirchnerismo', 'Clientelismo', 'Permisividad de corrupción']"

Misleiding in reclames - Mist het de leiding van pragmatische verfijning?,"Geer, Moniek van der","['Pilgram, Roosmaryn', 'Jungslager, Francisca']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Het kan van adverteerders redelijkerwijs worden gezegd dat zij strategisch manoeuvreren. Enerzijds proberen zij een doelgroep zo effectief te overtuigen van hun boodschap, anderzijds hebben zij veel verschillende grenzen om zich aan te houden: zowel de discussieregels als grenzen van het actietype. Deze grenzen zijn vastgelegd in de Nederlandse Reclame Code (NRC), die in stand wordt gehouden door de Reclame Code Commissie (RCC) en het College van Beroep (CvB) van de Stichting Reclame Code (SRC). Ook de adviezen van de Stichting zijn gebonden aan een kader. Het doel van dit onderzoek is analyseren in hoeverre de gronden waarop de RCC en het CvB hun beslissingen baseren, verfijnd kunnen worden aan de hand van de inzichten uit de pragmatiek. In de pragmatiek is al veel geschreven over misleiding, maar er is nog geen systematische manier om uitingen te analyseren. Daarom is – na het behandelen van de literatuur over coöperatie, liegen, manipulatie en bedrog vanuit een Griceaans perspectief – een eerste poging gedaan om een operationele definitie op te stellen. Deze is vervolgens gebruikt om drie dossiers van de SRC te (her)analyseren. In deze zaken hebben zowel de RCC als het CvB uitspraken gedaan, die niet altijd overeenkwamen, wat erop duidt dat er niet zonder meer overeenstemming is als het gaat om uitspraken over misleiding. Dit biedt ook de mogelijkheid tot verfijning van de gronden. Uit de analyse bleek dat er zeker manieren zijn waarop de inzichten uit de pragmatiek de gronden van de uitspraken kunnen verfijnen. Allereerst door de operationele definitie van misleiding mee te nemen, waarbij verschillende elementen geëxpliciteerd worden, die nu slechts gevoelsmatig behandeld lijken te worden. Daarnaast door niet alleen op de letterlijke tekst te focussen, ontstaat er een mogelijkheid ook het effect van implicaties en implicaturen te zien, die worden opgeroepen maar niet letterlijk aanwezig zijn. Als laatste is er nog een praktisch punt, dat in de behandeling van de RCC al verder wordt doorgezocht naar statistische onderbouwing van argumenten van de twee partijen. Hoewel er nog een aantal kanttekeningen en verbeterpunten te noemen zijn bij de analyse en resultaten/conclusies, laat dit onderzoek wel een mogelijkheid zien. De uitspraken over misleiding van de Reclame Code Commissie en het College van Beroep kunnen consistenter worden onderbouwd, door inzichten uit de pragmatiek te gebruiken. Vervolgonderzoek zou deze inspanning op grotere schaal kunnen uitvoeren, om te kijken of de conclusies ook kwantificeerbaar zijn.","['Misleiding', 'Pragmatiek', 'Reclames', 'Stichting Reclame Code', 'Reclame Code Commissie', 'College van Beroep', 'Nederlandse Reclame Code', 'Strategisch manoeuvreren', 'Uitgebreid pragma-dialectiek', 'Gezondheidsreclames']"

Not Easy to Be Young: Youth Discontent and Political Disillusionment in 1980s Soviet Union,"Pikane, Eliza","['Roberts, Flora']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The collapse of the Soviet Union has been explained as the result of political, economic and military factors. The social underpinnings of the collapse have drawn less interest. ''Is It Easy To Be Young?'', the 1987 documentary from Soviet Latvia, reveals political disillusionment among the youth. The film includes interviews with those members of society which have previously not been represented in state-controlled culture, for example, members of the punk movement and war veterans who feel alienated by society. Political opening in the framework of perestroika and glasnost allowed the documentary to come to light. I chose the following question to guide my work: ''How did the portrayal of youth discontent and political disillusionment in the 1987 Latvian documentary ''Is It Easy To Be Young?'' contribute to the declining legitimacy of the Soviet system?'' I argue that the release of this film worked against the authorities since it depicted some of the core issues in the USSR in the 1980s. These were persecution of those who opposed the dominant way of life, political disillusionment caused by stagnation and the use of rigid ideological notions by the Communist Party, as well as the social costs of involvement in Afghanistan. ''Is It Easy To Be Young?'' gained recognition abroad, where it was received as an exposé of the Soviet system, which further contributed to the decline in legitimacy the film caused for the authorities of the USSR.","['soviet youth', 'glasnost', 'perestroika', 'Latvia', 'documentary film', 'youth culture']"

Addressing ASEAN's Position on the Global Fight Against Sex Traffcking,"Tunggadewi, Natasya Karina","['Hadiprayitno, Irene']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Global Slavery Index accounts that the number of human trafficking victims (modern slavery) as of 2016 amounted to 40.3 million people, 71% of which are women and 99% of them are forced labor victims inside the sex industry (GSI 2018, i and ii). With Southeast Asia accommodating the largest hub for sex trafficking in the world, this raises international concern regarding security of victims and migration issues. The thesis considers the evolution of the global anti-trafficking movement in leading to the adoption of the 2000 UN Trafficking Protocol’s human trafficking definition. Scholars and foreign governments have pushed ASEAN to solve its trafficking issue in the region. However, this research questions whether the organization is suitable to combat the problem by firstly, examining the role of non-sovereignty and human rights in ASEAN, unveiling varying local perceptions and definitions of trafficking in Cambodia and Thailand, and then analyzing the impact of globalization on the sex industry. The research concludes that ASEAN could only take on the role of a facilitator providing a platform for Member States to cooperate in discussing effective anti-trafficking measures, rather than creating a mechanism of their own. No matter how hard ASEAN enforces anti-trafficking programs, the will to prevent sex trafficking must come from Member States to ensure the security and well-being of its citizens.",
Om de vrijheid van religie? Het mislukken van de religievrede van 1572 in Delft,"Visser, Johan","['Pollmann, Judith']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze scriptie stelt de vraag naar het waarom van het mislukken van de religievrede van Willem van Oranje in 1572 aan de hand van de stad Delft. De context waarin de religievrede ontstond maakte het moeilijk om de religievrede succesvol in te voeren. De overgang van Delft naar de Opstand toonde aan dat diverse actoren niet bereid (Graaf van Lumey, schutterijen) of in staat (stadsbestuur) zouden zijn om de religievrede af te dwingen. In de maanden tussen de overgang van Delft in juli en de komst van Oranje in november, kwam de positie van de katholieken steeds verder onder druk. Toen Oranje, de bedenker zelf in november 1572 naar Holland kwam en in Delft ging wonen, slaagde hij evenmin in om zijn religiepolitiek in te voeren. Oranje gaf prioriteit aan het controleren van de Opstand en daarbij kwam het invoeren van zijn religiepolitiek op de tweede plaats. Oranje wist zijn godsdienst politiek te rekken. De religievrede sneuvelde door ontwikkelingen op lokaal niveau, het zogenaamde verbod op de katholieke eredienst dat in april 1573 op een vergadering in Leiden door de Staten van Holland genomen zou zijn, is waarschijnlijk toen niet genomen en gebaseerd op een foutieve interpretatie van de bronnen.","['religievrede', 'Willem van Oranje', 'Delft', '1572', 'Religious tolerance', 'Opstand']"

Bush and Obama administrations with regard to foreign policy toward Iran. As these two presidents took office after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, this paper will be analyzing their foreign policy decisions and approaches toward Iran in the context of the War on Terror. Right after the 9/11 attacks, George W. Bush designated Iran as part of the ‘axis of evil’ which he considered to be foreign governments that sponsored terrorism and sought weapons of mass destruction. Interestingly enough, when Bush launched the War on Terror military campaign, his plans included the invasion of several Middle-Eastern countries but excluded Iran. Iran was known to have nuclear capabilities but was never invaded. Under Bush, relations are considered to have worsened due to the 9/11 attacks, Iran’s suspected possession of nuclear weapons, and sanctions placed by the U.N. and the United States. When President Obama was elected in 2009 however, his approach to foreign policy dramatically shifted the political environment but ultimately resulted in improved relations between the two countries. The difference in approach to foreign policy, the tactics, and the results between Bush and Obama will be the focus of this research.","['foreign affairs', 'Iran', 'Bush', 'Obama']"

Private Military and Security Companies: Determining Accountability in the Face of a Crumbling Westphalian World Order,"Thomson, Callum Alexander German","['Ennis, Crystal']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper seeks to aid in the accountability process for private military and security companies by providing clarity as to whom these companies should be rendered accountable. The dissertation makes use of an adapted version of Bovens’ Framework for Accountability, incorporating five different forms of accountability – political, legal, professional, social, and economic. Through the application of this framework onto two case studies of Wagner Group in Syria and Blackwater USA in Iraq, it is evident that the use of limited accountability through only one or two forms of accountability is insufficient. It was found that in order for PMSCs to be rendered accountable to an unbiased independent body as suggested by this author, all forms of accountability should be used simultaneously. This paper further examines reiterating the importance of the oft-neglected social accountability, and how the role of morality at the human and public opinion level can shape the way in which regulatory measures apply. Through these findings, this thesis recommends the implementation of a series of new legislative measures, which utilise a multi-pronged approach incorporating not only legal methods, but social, political, professional, and economic measures","['Private Military', 'Private Security', 'Accountability', 'Middle East', 'Syria', 'Iraq', 'Blackwater', 'Wagner', 'Corporate Warfare']"
When Coloured Things Serve the Memory Well: An Analysis on Coloured Things as Memory’s Mediators in the Films And the Wife shall Revere her Husband and The Red Balloon,"Damianaki, Eirini","['Lammes, Sybille']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Colour. A colour, the colour, any colour. Colour in everyday life. Coloured things that individuals use regularly. Colour on the walls, colour in the frames. Colour in the photographs. Colour on the multiple screens. Colour in media and films. Furthermore, via things, colour has this potential to speak and evoke memory. In this thesis, I discuss how colour links with memory. More precisely, I analyse how coloured things work as memory’s mediators in two films: And the Wife shall Revere her Husband (1965), and The Red Balloon (1956). In the first case, I claim that coloured things can evoke memory, while in the second, how coloured things work as memes that create memory. In this process, my personal stories assisted me to approach colour in this way. Colours work within a network with their surroundings. In the following pages, I reflect on my own past experiences and I claim that colour and memory have an indisputable connection.Valuable theories and methods from different disciplines, such as media and film studies, sociology and philosophy, stand by my side in this journey. Colours are endless and constant. Without any further delay, allow me to remember and analyse moments through a rainbow costume, a homemade pie, a white hat, and a red balloon.","['colour', 'memory', 'colorization', 'black and white', 'film', 'media', 'memes']"

Exploring a Relational Methodology: An Empirical Application of Qin Yaqing’s Relationality Theory to the Sino-Filipino Dispute in the South China Sea,"Kuteev Moreira, Dário","[""d'Hooghe, Ingrid""]",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The aim of this thesis is two-fold. First, to scrutinize the explanatory capacity of Qin Yaqing’s Relationality Theory. Second, to elucidate the Sino-Filipino case, where the lack of hositlites following the Arbitral Tribunal’s favorable ruling to the Philippines presents a puzzle to mainstream International Relations Theory. This thesis finds that the concepts in Qin’s theory offer three novel explanations. First, increased intimacy between both countries sheds light on why no higher-level conflict erupted. Second, the distinction between rule-driven and rule-independent measures partly accounts for the intermittently resurgent tension spikes, as the latter often undermined the former’s conducive efforts to cooperation. Finally, relational rationality sheds light on how competing interests for each actor render both sides’ actions rational. Despite these insights, two limitations stand out. First, the main difficulty found concerns the methodological application of various concepts. Second, the lack of clarity on how different variables interact with one another constituted a hurdle to the theory’s explanatory capacity.","['Relationality', 'Qin Yaqing', 'China Philippines', 'South China Sea Arbitration', 'Non-Western IRT']"

Subsequently, in the second chapter, historical trends will be established by considering the Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA) and the Andean Pact. Finally, the influence of the three variables on two contemporary regional organizations, the Pacific Alliance and Mercosur, will be analysed in the third chapter.

Traces of 'Pre-Indo-Iranian': Chronological Layers and Structural Characteristics of Early Indo-Iranian Loanwords,"Palmér, Axel Ingemar","['Lubotsky, Alexander']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I study loanwords of unknown origin in Proto-Indo-Iranian and early Post-Proto-Indo-Iranian. According to the Central Asian Substrate Hypothesis, Indo-Iranian speakers migrated to Central Asia around 2000 BCE and came into contact with the agricultural BMAC civilization, which resulted in a body of loanwords into Proto-Indo-Iranian, borrowed from the language of the BMAC people. Following a methodology for identifying non-Indo-European vocabulary in Indo-European languages, I argue that 74 out of 103 previously suggested loanwords can plausibly be analyzed as loanwords (chapter 3). Only a handful of these may have been borrowed from known languages. After establishing the relative chronology of Proto-Indo-Iranian sound changes (chapter 2), I divide the 74 early Indo-Iranian loanwords into chronological layers based on when they were borrowed (chapter 3-4). I argue that 21 words were borrowed after the disintegration of Proto-Indo-Iranian. Moreover, I argue that many of the remaining 53 loanwords that are reconstructable to Proto-Indo-Iranian were borrowed towards the end of this stage. Finally, I integrate the chronological layers into my analysis of structural characteristics of early Indo-Iranian loanwords and describe two new phonological patterns of loanwords (chapter 5). The fact that many loanwords are shown to have been borrowed in late PII or Post-PII, i.e. after Indo-Iranian speakers migrated to Central Asia, is consistent with the timeline of the Central Asian Substrate Hypothesis. Second, the newly discovered phonological characteristics provide additional support for the Central Asian Substrate Hypothesis, since they increase the likelihood that most loanwords originate in the same language.","['Indo-Iranian historical linguistics', 'Linguistic substrates', 'Proto-Indo-Iranian', 'Relative chronology', 'Linguistic prehistory of Central and South Asia', 'Dispersal of Indo-European languages', 'Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex']"

Geocritical Interpretation of Spatial Imagery in Robert Merle's Derrière la vitre,"Kuznetsova, Evgeniia","['Schulte Nordholt, Annelies']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Derrière la vitre (Behind the Glass) is a 1970 novel by a French writer Robert Merle. It focuses on the hour-by-hour recital of events of one day, 22 March 1968, that led to occupation of the Sorbonne's newly built campus in Nanterre and started further student protest movement of May 1968. The same series of events is presented through focal points of several characters, including students, professors and Algerian workers living the Nanterre bidonville close to the faculty construction site, allowing to examine and compare their experiences. The spatial imagery of Nanterre itself plays an important role in the narrative, and is often compared and opposed to the new concrete-and-glass faculty building. The metaphor of «glass» separating idealistically inspired students from the immigrant workers, with whose very hands this «glass» had been built, and, more broadly, from France in general is essential to the novel. The paradox that gave birth to this research is in the apparent contradiction between, on one hand, multiple descriptions of the emptiness and facelessness of Nanterre from different points of view and, on the other hand, a heavy corpus of historical associations that these same spaces evoke in the the collective memory of the characters. The former allows to apply the concept of the non-place to the humal spaces in the text, while the latter opens a possibility to speak of the «site of memory» (lieu de mémoire) value of the described places. Using a thoroughly presented methodological and conseptual framework, I am aiming at elaborating, how paradoxal this particularity, in fact, is, and at answering the question, if the spatial imagery of Nanterre in Derrière la vitre, described during the one particular historical turning point, can be geocritically read as a non-place in the process of becoming a lieu de mémoire.","['geocriticism', 'spatial imagery', 'human space', 'site of memory', 'non-place', 'Robert Merle']"
"Molukkers in Nederland: de invloed van het KNIL-verleden op overheidsbeleid, cultuurbehoud en integratie","Sloff, Jurriaan","['Luttikhuis, Bart']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In 1951 zagen 12.500 Molukkers, voornamelijk voormalige militairen van het Koninklijk Nederlands-Indisch Leger (KNIL) en hun gezinnen, zich gedwongen om voor ‘tijdelijke’ opvang naar Nederland uit te wijken. Na eeuwen van steunbetuiging aan de Nederlandse overheid verwachtten zij eveneens steun voor hun terugkeer en eigen idealen, maar eenmaal aangekomen in Nederland werden de Molukkers grotendeels vergeten – de meeste Molukkers keerden nooit terug naar hun eiland van herkomst. Deze scriptie tracht te onderzoeken hoe men met deze situatie omging, en op welke manier de voormalige KNIL-status hier een rol in speelde. Beïnvloedde dit het beleid van de Nederlandse overheid enerzijds, en de manier waarop men integreerde en de eigen cultuurpatronen behield anderzijds? Om dit te onderzoeken plaatst deze scriptie zich binnen de bestaande historiografie, en poogt aan de hand van onder meer memoires, herdenkingsboeken en dichtbundels van Molukse hand te reconstrueren welke rol het KNIL bleef spelen voor de Molukse gemeenschap in Nederland. Aanvankelijk lijkt het vooral de eerste generatie Molukkers, die zelf nog in Nederlands-Indië gediend had, die koppig vasthield aan elementen uit de KNIL-cultuur, zo blijkt uit herdenkingsboeken over de verschillende opvanglocaties voor Molukkers in Nederland. Binnen de Molukse gemeenschap ontstond ook spoedig brede steun voor de Republik Maluku Selatan (RMS), een in 1950 geproclameerde onafhankelijke Zuid-Molukse Republiek. De tweede generatie Molukkers in Nederland nam meer afstand van het KNIL-verleden, en werd radicaler in de steun voor een vrije RMS. Primair bronmateriaal van Molukse auteurs uit de periode 1970-1980 doet vermoeden dat het KNIL vrijwel volledig uit de Molukse identiteit verdween – pas wanneer de RMS-strijd weer minder radicaal werd leek het Molukse verleden herontdekt te worden. In recente jaren neemt het aantal verschenen herdenkingsboeken en memoires toe, met daarin veelal een centrale rol voor het KNIL-verleden, een blijk dat de geschiedenis nog niet vergeten is. Recente tegemoetkomingen door de Nederlandse overheid gelden als blijk van erkenning van de vaak ronduit slechte behandeling van de Molukse gemeenschap in Nederland, en laten zien dat het KNIL-hoofdstuk nog niet zo definitief is afgesloten als wel eens wordt gedacht.","['Molukkers', 'Postkoloniale migratie', 'Integratie', 'Cultuurbehoud', 'Republik Maluku Selatan', 'Koninklijk Nederlands-Indisch Leger']"

By using interdisciplinary literary research and comparative media research, this unique performance is first studied from an art performance perspective, with a focus on art performances held on the streets. Secondly the performance is placed in the context of definitions of religious processions, and in the third chapter, the Modern Procession is analyzed from an anthropological and social-geographical standpoint. This thorough analysis does not only reveal the many layers of the Modern Procession, but also what happens when art is taken out of the museum and presented in a new context. By presenting the collection of the MoMA on the streets of New York, the connection between collections and museums is made clear: it is namely art that forms the real heart of a museum, not the building where it is displayed.","['The Modern Procession', 'Francis Alÿs', 'The Museum of Modern Art', 'MoMA', 'Art Procession', 'Processions', 'Art Performance', 'New York City']"

Considering that the two parties as well as Germany and Austria are ostensibly similar, this puzzle leads to the question of what explains the so markedly different election results of the AfD and the FPÖ in 2017. Based on a review of general factors that explain the success of populist radical right parties and extensive research on the aspects that led to the rise and success of the AfD and FPÖ, the paper focuses on the role of the media, seeking to understand how the two parties were portrayed by the media before the 2017 elections. This task is approached by conducting a qualitative content analysis of the reporting on the AfD by the Bild Zeitung and the depiction of the FPÖ by the Kronen Zeitung, the two most popular online daily newspapers in their countries, during the last month before the elections. It is shown that the two parties used different framing strategies to report on the AfD or FPÖ respectively, resulting in a much more negative portrayal of the former. Considering that the FPÖ was depicted in a more positive way and got a much higher result in the election, the paper contributes to the literature by supporting the theory that the media have an influence on election results by shaping the public image of parties and their leaders, thereby influencing the voter’s perception of them, and offers a relevance point for further research on explaining the varied election results of the AfD and FPÖ in the 2017 elections.","['AfD', 'FPÖ', 'newspaper']"
European Union and Transnistria.

A series of instruments and missions have been deployed to work on regions that require assistance on strengthening their security systems. The creation of European Neighbourhood Policy aimed achieving a closer cooperation with the EU’s neighbours in the south and east by promoting common values such as democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law. In this way, the EU hoped achieving greater stability in the regions involved. Since Romania became an EU member state in 2007, the EU became more involved in its neighbour country Moldova. Solving the Transnistria conflict issue has become a key priority for the EU. Several policies have been issued to tackle the issue and initiate reform, especially through Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and European Neighbourhood Policy frameworks. However, the enacted policies did not bring a solution to the conflict. This thesis aims to explain why this has been the case. In this way, this thesis aims to contribute to an explanation of third parties intervention in conflict regions in a global perspective.","['conflict intervention', 'Transnistria', 'European Union', 'conflict settlement', 'conflict region']"

Drug-Trafficking Related Violence in Mexico,"Guian Illanes, Max","['Crevels, Mily']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since 2006, Mexico has experienced periods of very high levels of violence and homicide rates, product of a developing conflict between the government and drug trafficking organizations (DTOs). Following a shift in political regimes in 2000 which resulted in the decentralization of government power and an increased focus on combatting corruption, relations between the DTOs and the government grew tense. In 2006, President Felipe Calderón decided to militarize the drug war, resulting in a number of developments which appear to have compromised Mexico’s public security. This thesis attempts to create a timeline of the developments that have occurred since 2006 linked to this conflict. It argues that the government’s interventions against DTOs have amplified the intensity of violence in conflict through applying brute force and poorly thought out policies. The timeline is constructed through the presentation of empirical data coupled with a number of key events that I believe have played a role in the development of drug-related violence in Mexico.",
"Private Multi-Stakeholder Governance in Indonesia’s Palm Oil Industry: A Case Study of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, Its Internal Politics and Relationship with the State","Soegiri, Putera Zenata Ignastia","['Burgos-Martinez, Elena']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The economic benefits brought by Indonesia’s palm oil industry come with significant environmental costs including yearly forest fires and transboundary haze. The slow progress of state regulatory efforts spurred some international private stakeholders to form a private multi-stakeholder governance institution; the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), which uses market-driven instruments such as sustainability certification to promote environmentally sound practices among its members. Using a mix-method design analyses on interviews, meeting minutes, attendance records and other primary and secondary data, the thesis assesses RSPO against three global political economy schools of thought: neoclassical, statist and critical political economy. The findings support the neoclassical perspective to a certain extent as they show that RSPO has gradually built a robust and comprehensive sustainability certification system with a strong focus on peatland management and protection. RSPO achieves its progress, despite the voluntary nature of its membership, by establishing a strong foundation of democratic governance within its decision-making processes. However, the thesis also finds an imbalance of political power between the different membership sectors in RSPO’s internal governance and an accumulation of authority in the hands of a few influential members that have resulted in marginalization of certain stakeholders, most notably the Indonesian growers and civil societies. The perceived lack of political representation of Indonesian stakeholders in RSPO - an institution that purports to ‘govern’ one of the most lucrative industries in the nation - seems to validate the statists’ notion that PMG institutions seek to reduce and replace the role of the state. This exclusivity has led to the formation of a rival certification system by the state: The Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil.","['Private multi-stakeholder governance', 'Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil', 'Palm Oil', 'Indonesia', 'Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil', 'RSPO', 'ISPO', 'Southeast Asian haze and forest fires', 'Sustainable development', 'Private governance']"
The Laryngeal Specification and Distribution of Fricatives in Germanic: An Element Theoretical Approach,"Haga, Thomas Benjamin","['Botma, Bert']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The laryngeal specification of obstruents, especially in Germanic, has been the subject of extensive study. However, most work has focussed on the laryngeal contrast in stops, while fricatives have received comparatively little attention. This thesis presents a detailed examination of fricatives in Germanic languages from the perspective of Element Theory (ET), which, following the ‘laryngeal realism’ approach, distinguishes between H-languages (‘aspiration languages’) and L-languages (‘voicing languages’). The results of this examination show that fricatives do not always show the same behaviour as stops. First, in laryngeal contrasts, stops can always be distinguished by a laryngeal specification, whereas this is not always the case for fricatives, as voiced fricatives are sometimes not laryngeally specified. This is particularly true in North Germanic languages, since many voiced fricatives are better described as approximants, i.e. sonorants. Furthermore, while the stops in German and Dutch employ a laryngeal contrast, fricatives are argued to possibly differ in length instead. Second, the distribution of fricatives in syllable structure does not always parallel that of stops. Fricatives are pervasive in rhymal adjunct positions, whereas stops are primarily favoured in onsets. Of the fricatives, sibilants are the most ubiquitous in the rhymal adjunct position, and can in some cases even occur in the rhymal adjuncts of empty-headed syllables.",

I take on the theory of nation and nationalism as a framework to discuss and visually analyse the portraits of Kenya's four president and citizens portrait in the form of identity photography. By first establishing how modern-state Kenya came into being, the discussion set a premise to the motivation behind the study. The first chapter analyses the standardised official presidential state portraits, their materiality, physicality and their symbolism to communicate a change of leadership in Kenya. The second chapter investigates the 'self-fashioned' portraits of the presidents which take on different aesthetics and visual codes creating different meanings and therefore are interpreted using other references. The last chapter is a shift from 'honorific' portraiture of the presidents to the 'repressive' class of the sitters- the citizens. This chapter investigates citizen's portraits used in the colonial times to control movements of labourers and surveillance and how it is now used as a form of document of National Identification. This thesis argues that all the mentioned kinds of portraiture contributed to disseminating the idea of nationhood.","['Photography', 'Portraiture', 'Portrait(s)', 'National Identity', 'Kenya', 'Africa', 'President(s)', 'Nationhood', 'Nation', 'Nationalism', 'Independence', 'colonialism']"
"WOMEN IN ERITREA: WAR, POLITICS AND SOCIETY","Knödler, Lara","['Bellucci, S. (Stefano)']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Narratives depicting women in war prominently represent women as vulnerable victims and rarely is female empowerment during war and post-war period brought to the fore. This thesis sheds light on how female empowerment is created in wartime and advocated in the post-war period. A common consensus among scholars is that women gain empowerment during times of war. According to scholars, the empowerment gained during war is lost in its aftermath. This thesis discusses female empowerment in Eritrea during the Eritrean War of Independence (1961-1991), and its effects on post-war Eritrean society. To answer the research question “How has female participation in the Eritrean War of Independence influenced the role of women in post-conflict Eritrean society?” this paper examines both quantitative and qualitative data to further the understanding of how concepts of patriarchy, social convention and empowerment paint a picture of Eritrean women’s lived reality. This paper argues that the ideology of the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF) failed to address women’s needs by erasing the feminine and repressing the domestic. The main struggle recognized in the research is the suppression of progressive self-confident former female fighters by the patriarchal beliefs of their families. While gender equality in the EPLF progressed over the course of the war, civil society was in a “frozen” state of emergency. Hence, when the war ended, civil society proceeded to revert to the traditional gender roles from the pre-war period.","['female fighters', 'Eritrean war of independence', 'societal pressure', 'empowerment', 'post-conflict']"

"Oeganda terug de kast in: de invloed van de Amerikaanse, christelijk-rechtse lobby op het homofobe klimaat in Oeganda","Simons, Charlotte","['Mous, Maarten']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Afrikaanse talen en culturen (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De laatste jaren is er door westerse media veel gepubliceerd over het toenemende, homofobe klimaat in het Oost-Afrikaanse land Oeganda. In Oeganda heerst het idee dat homoseksualiteit een westerse, neokoloniale uitvinding is, die vervolgens op het Afrikaanse continent geïntroduceerd is; onder veel Oegandezen heerst zelfs de notie dat homoseksualiteit een tool is om geboortebeperking op het continent te bewerkstelligen, en homoseksuelen zouden tot alles in staat zijn om de homosexual agenda verder te verspreiden. Religie speelt een zeer centrale rol in het leven van een meerderheid van de Oegandezen, en maakt een intrinsiek deel van het dagelijks leven uit. Met mijn onderzoek heb ik geprobeerd te bepalen welke invloed de Amerikaanse, christelijk-rechtse lobby lobby op het homofobe klimaat in Oeganda heeft. Daarbij heb ik ook gekeken naar de inmenging van westerse media in het anti- homodebat, en door welke combinatie van factoren het homofobe klimaat in Oeganda in eerste instantie ontstaan is. Dit heb ik gedaan door middel van literatuuronderzoek, in combinatie met een eigen, kleinschalig onderzoek in Kampala. Uit mijn onderzoek bleek dat seksuele minderheden voorafgaand en gedurende de kolonisatieperiode niet geheel geaccepteerd werden, maar wel in relatieve vrijheid konden leven en doorgaans niet vervolgd werden. Dit veranderde in 1997, toen de Anglicaanse kerk – zo ook in Oeganda – zich actief uit begon te spreken tegen homoseksualiteit. In de daaropvolgende jaren vonden steeds meer Amerikaanse, christelijk-rechtse zendelingen hun weg naar het Oost-Afrikaanse land. Oeganda bleek vruchtbare grond te zijn voor homofobe sentimenten, en dus begon ook een groeiend aantal Oegandese politici zich in het debat te mengen. In 2009 werd de eerste versie van de Anti-Homosexuality Bill ingediend bij het parlement. De veelal negatieve reacties van westerse media, die de Oegandese overheid niet zelden als incompetent neerzetten, en het Oegandese volk als intolerant, zorgden ervoor dat Oeganda gesterkt werd in haar geloof dat het Westen bepaalde normen en waarden aan Oeganda – en in een bredere context Afrika – op probeerden te dringen. Verschillende factoren hebben een aandeel gespeeld in het creëren van het huidige homofobe klimaat in het Oost-Afrikaanse land; de komst van de eerste, Britse zendelingen die het christendom kwamen verspreiden, de daaropvolgende stigmatisering rondom homoseksualiteit, de in 1950 ingevoerde Penal Code, de inmenging van de Anglicaanse kerk in het debat en de daaruit voortvloeiende nieuwe golf van homofobie, de komst van een groeiend aantal Amerikaanse, conservatieve zendelingen in Oeganda, de Anti-Homosexuality Bill uit 2009 en de daaropvolgende berichtgeving in de westerse media, die Oeganda lijnrecht tegenover het Westen wist te zetten. Daar moet ook bij vermeld worden dat, ondanks het feit dat er zonder twijfel uitzonderingen zijn, de meeste westerse mediaberichten over de Oegandese Anti- Homosexuality Bill en het bredere, homofoboe klimaat in het land tekortgeschoten zijn, door de nieuwsfeiten niet in een culturele, sociale, politieke en/of religieuze context te plaatsen. Oorzaken en accelerators van de ontstane homofobie in het land werden vrijwel niet aan de kaak gesteld. Verschillende lhbtqi-activisten in Oeganda beamen dat de situatie omtrent lhbtqi’ers in het Oost-Afrikaanse land vaak wordt gedramatiseerd door westerse media, wat geen realistische representatie van de daadwerkelijke situatie geeft. Uit mijn onderzoek bleek dus dat er, voor de komst van de grote aantallen Amerikaanse missionarissen, al vruchtbare grond was voor een homofoob klimaat in Oeganda, waar de Amerikaanse, christelijk-rechtse lobby verder op heeft ingehaakt door homofobe sentimenten actief aan te wakkeren. Er zijn door hen allianties gevormd met Oegandese wetmakers en politici, die politiek gewin haalden uit het aanhangen van een homofoob, politiek gemotiveerd narratief. Alhoewel veel Amerikaanse, conservatieve missionarissen in Oeganda zich niet bewust lijken te zijn van de uitwerkingen die hun uitspraken in de Oegandese samenleving kunnen hebben, is gebleken dat het Oegandese volk – bij gebrek aan een alom aanwezige politiemacht – er in veel gevallen niet over twijfelt het heft in eigen handen te nemen, en homoseksualiteit binnen hun gemeenschap te ‘bestrijden’ door middel van mob justice. Tot het jaar 1997, toen de Anglicaanse kerk zich actief in het anti- homoseksualiteitdebat begon te mengen, was er van mob justice richting seksuele minderheden vrijwel geen sprake. Ook de theorie achter de gay agenda is een vrij recent opgekomen fenomeen, dat in korte tijd veel aanhangers heeft weten te vergaren. De invloed van Amerikaanse, christelijke conservatievelingen heeft zelfs een impact gehad op de Oegandese wetgeving, zo blijkt wel uit de totstandkoming van de Bahati Bill, waaraan achter de schermen verschillende Amerikaanse conservatieve organisaties en individuen hebben meegewerkt. De verschillende homofobe frames die in het anti-homodebat gevormd zijn hebben zo’n hevige impact gehad op de gemiddelde Oegandees, dat seksuele minderheden ten alle tijden op hun hoede moeten zijn en moeten vrezen voor hun veiligheid. Want alhoewel het aantal gewelddadige incidenten richting lhbtiq’ers in Oeganda nog altijd relatief laag is, is het wel een in omvang toenemend probleem.","['Africa', 'Uganda', 'Oeganda', 'LHBTQI', 'Seksuele minderheden', 'Homoseksualiteit', 'Oost-Afrika', 'Afrika', 'Zendeling', 'Zendelingen', 'Christendom']"

First, the literature on the topic of body part nomenclature, partonomy and on metaphorical uses of body parts in African languages will be reviewed. Then, the methodology employed and data collected on Xhosa body nomenclature and partonomy and the metaphorical expressions will be presented. Thirdly, the body parts and their metaphorical uses that were collected will be described and analysed. Fourthly, the data collected will be compared to cross-linguistic data and data from similar studies performed on African languages. These components will finally accumulate to a concluding discussion on Xhosa body part nomenclature, partonomy and its metaphorical uses by exploring the ways in which Xhosa speakers conceive of body parts semantically and conceptualise them linguistically, with a special case study of the terms iminwe (fingers) and iinzwane (toes).","['Xhosa', 'Anthropological Linguistics', 'Body Part', 'Body Part Nomenclature', 'Metaphor', 'Partonomy', 'toes', 'fingers']"

Some believe that China’s approach to aid offers developing countries a better alternative than traditional methods of aid, that have arguably failed to stimulate economic development among emerging economies.

Yet, despite these contesting debates, very little empirical research tests China’s effectiveness in stimulating economic development in developing economies, specifically their engagements in South Asia. This research hopes to use the China-Pakistan economic corridor as a case-study to analyse China’s engagements in Pakistan, a topic not currently discussed in mainstream international relations. Using Ezeala-Harrison’s theory of economic definition to test China’s developmental efforts in Pakistan, the findings of this study critique China’s aid patterns in developing countries, and hope to reveal the deeper underlying motivations behind China’s investments in Pakistan, and in extension, their engagements with the developing world.","['CPEC', 'Sino-Pakistan relations', 'Aid', 'Economic Development', ""China's aid Patterns"", 'foreign aid', 'developmental assistance', 'Economic corridor']"

Insights have been offered into the current discord between, and conflicting interests of, the EU and its Member States, and whether the EU in its current state can offer the incentives necessary for Europeanisation to progress in a region with simmering nationalist and ethnic tensions. However, little effort has been expended on exploring whether and how EU policy towards the Western Balkans has been affected by increasingly assertive Russian foreign policy. To answer this, I will examine the accession process from the annexation of Crimea in 2014 until 2018, a year which saw two major European summits dedicated to the region. The exploration of whether Russia is considered a threat to the EU's ambitions in the region and how the EU has chosen to respond will result in a greater understanding of the Union's capacities and limits as an international actor.","['Western Balkans', 'EU Enlargement', 'EU Foreign Policy', 'Russia']"

United in Fear: imperial anti-communist cooperation in interwar Southeast Asia,"Janssen, Buddy","['Stolte, Carolien']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the interwar anti-communist cooperation between the European colonial governments in Southeast Asia by examining its origins, functioning and underlying ideology and connection to the Cold War. In doing so, it connects the historical debates on the origin of the Cold War to imperial history. While ample literature exists on the crossroads between Empire and the Cold War with regard to decolonisation, literature that examines the imperial roots of anti-communism remains scarce. This thesis aims to fill that gap. The first chapter analyses how the European colonial officials in Southeast Asia created a transnational anti-communist, information-sharing network. The impetuses for cooperation, both internally and externally, are central to this chapter. Starting at its origins in 1924, the chapter traces the build-up period of the cooperation until 1931. The second chapter follows chronologically on the first but delves into both the merits and limitations of the cooperation by focussing on the outdated imperial legal systems that ultimately prevented optimal cooperation. Finally, the third chapter analyses the underlying ideas and principles of the anti-communist imagined community. The chapter treats the construction of the false binary of communism/anti-communism and connects it to the imperial experience. All three chapters combined provide unique insight into the creation and maintenance of the anti-communist transnational network in colonial Southeast Asia. It is argued that this network can be seen as a microcosm that prefigured both the later Cold War alliances and understanding of the Soviet Union as a subversive expansionist empire.",['anti-communism southeast asia empire communism colonialism imperial colonialism diplomacy']

Financing development cooperation through public-private partnerships: a case study on the Aqua for All-Hydroponics Africa collaboration,"Fusi, Alessandro","['Abbink, Jan']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The late 20th century has seen a rise of debates on the real effectiveness of international development cooperation programmes, at least in the way they were conceived and implemented starting from the first post-WWII decades. The main outcome of these ongoing discussions has been the urgency of a “paradigm change” in development cooperation, in order to enhance its social impact and increase the resources dedicated to it. In chapter two, which is about my conceptual framework, I discuss this change more in detail. It implies shifting from a model based on unilateral actions from governments, public society organisations or private actors, in favour of multi-stakeholder collaborations between these three categories of actors, to pool together their specific resources and expertise towards the achievement of development goals. Chapter three is dedicated to presenting the emergence of this new paradigm of development cooperation, as well as the historical reasons that led to it, and how it is presently being implemented in the form of cross-sector collaborations. Of the latter, we will focus on the case of public-private partnerships and specifically on their application as instruments of blended finance, explaining the origins and the definitions of the concept and its potential advantages – as well as limits – compared to pure public or private development interventions. Chapter four will present a case study of a public-private partnership established between Dutch development agency “Aqua for All”, and Kenyan company “Hydroponics Africa”, for the realisation of a development project in the area of Nairobi and its surroundings. After introducing the project, we will evaluate the strong points and the shortcomings of Aqua for All’s approach to development cooperation in relation to the project at hand. This will be done by analysing the outcomes of interviews conducted with Hydroponics Africa’s CEO, directly involved in the elaboration and implementation of the partnership, as well as the people targeted by the project, to assess its results in terms of social impact.","['Development cooperation', 'Public-private partnership', 'Kenya', 'Hydroponic', 'Farming', 'Blended finance', 'Entrepreneurship']"

From anti-imperialism to anti-Americanism in Venezuela. Analyzing the effect of 9/11 and the War on Terror on the political discourse of Hugo Chavez.,"Schrama, Axelle","['Valdivia Rivera, Soledad']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Hugo Chavez Frías’ virulent discourse has until his death fed the appetite of media, politicians and academics. Mostly known for his social and anti-imperialist program as well as the success of his leftist movement across the Latin American region, the former Venezuelan President has also attracted attention with his denunciation of the Bush administration, the neoliberal system, and more generally the United States’ foreign policy. Publicly shaming the American government for the invasion, bombing, and killing of thousands of civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq at the 2006 United Nations Assembly, there were no doubts for the international community that Chavez’s anti-imperialist ideology had definitely shifted into an anti-American one following the 9/11 attacks and the launching of the War on Terror. That popular thinking was however challenged in the last decade by academics who passionately debated on the origins of Chavez’s anti-Americanism, some advocating a definite shift -yet unrelated to the events of 9/11, others defending the linearity of his discourse. For years, three theories have thus evolved around the figure of Hugo Chavez and the nature of his discourse. With the support of a strong theoretical framework, historical reflection and Political Discourse Analysis, this thesis ultimately aims to solve this discussion.","['Hugo Chavez', 'anti-imperialism', 'anti-Americanism', 'postcolonialism', 'socialism', 'Latin American Left', 'War on Terror', '9/11', 'Political Discourse Analysis']"
Idolisation as a Nation-building Mechanism: The Case of Hendrik Witbooi in Namibia,"Greeven, Marijn","['Stathopoulos, Athanasios']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The psychological relationships that people have with celebrities or idols can influence communal cohesion. Almost everyone in modern society relates to non-present or distant others. Our idols can affect the way we perceive ourselves and others. Generally, people associate more with national than with foreign idols. This creates a more communal national appreciation and contributes to the national ‘imagined communities.’ People from the same nation associate with each other through their shared idols. Therefore, idols can be used as a nation-building mechanism. For many African countries, nation-building has been crucial due to the formation of states by colonial powers. This has resulted in the separation of relatives and the grouping of distinct societies. One of the African countries with a rich colonial history and a diverse ethnic landscape is Namibia. In this context, the thesis examines the contribution of idolisation of local heroes to national identities, specifically in the case of Namibia’s freedom fighter Hendrik Witbooi. Through a literature review and interviews with Namibians, different idolisation mediums have been identified, including newspapers, television broadcasts, visual representations, stories, and songs. The contribution that these idolisation mediums have made to national identity is the promotion of a communal shared history, one of the key elements of a ‘nation.’ In the case of Namibia, this consists of a shared history of traumatic events, specifically the German and South African colonisation and the ‘Namibian genocide,’ however, it includes heroes that rose up against the perpetrators of these injustices. Consideration is given to the influence of the SWAPO-government and comparable cases of idolisation in other countries.","['Hendrik Witbooi', 'idolisation', 'nation-building', 'national identity', 'Namibia', 'shared history']"
Are Filipino migrants the key to development? Remittances and the Moral Hazard Problem,"Manugas, Nicole Jular","['Shidiq, Akhmad Rizal']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In recent years, remittances, the sum of money sent by migrant workers to families back home, have emerged as the major source of external development finance. In 2007, remittances from migrant workers doubled the size of Direct Foreign Aid and in 2017 migrant sending countries received over US$450 billion, 10 times more than what they’ve received 20 years earlier. Despite the wide range of studies conducted on the monetary effects of labour migration and remittances through the neoclassical immigration theory lenses, which claims that international migration “is a win-win situation”, less attention is drawn onto the moral hazard problem and the culture of dependency that the same issues bring about. Guided by the research question: What are the effects of Overseas Filipino Workers’ remittances on public service provision in the Philippines? My research aims to engage the reader into a critical re-thinking process of the nature of migration and remittances. I wish to argue that it is pivotal to consider the wider concept of labor migration and the burden relegated by migrant-sending governments to “their” citizens on the move. If remittances “do the job”, what is the role of the State? Is it the diaspora's to provide for their country? The underlying scope of the thesis is to test whether skepticists' speculations that remittances “are not a panacea” but rather a strategy for governments to decrease their accountability towards their citizens and ultimately to evaluate whether the public moral hazard problem holds to the Philippine case too.","['Moral hazard problem', 'Public service provision', 'Political economy', 'Philippine government', 'Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs)', 'Remittances', 'Corruption']"

The second chapter explains the qualitative content analysis conducted to ascertain postcolonial structures within the negotiations. The third chapter presents the results of the analysis, followed by a discussion that critically analyses the research performed, tests the thesis’s hypotheses, and examines the possibilities of how the conclusions drawn can be used to make international cooperation on climate change and agriculture more effective. Finally, the conclusion highlights that international cooperation on agriculture excludes the value of contributions from developing countries’ local entities in consulting on adaptation and climate change action, highlights the research’s limits, and suggests future research projects.",
Falling Through the Cracks - Street Children in Cairo,"Veenhoven, Jitske","['Henderson, Christian']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to explore how street children in Cairo are governed. It takes a multi-level approach through examining the public level, aid organizations and the Egyptian government. The way street children are perceived on these different levels influences policy approach. Street children are rejected by Egyptian society, and a negative stereotype about them dominates the public view. The choices that street children must make in their daily life accentuate these stereotypes. A recent paradigm shift in academia has led aid organizations from viewing street children as passive subjects of charity towards a more human rights-based approach. Despite this paradigm shift, the government has yet to adapt its policy and continues to treat street children as delinquents. This thesis calls for more research on the topic of street children, in order to map out the magnitude of the problem. Furthermore, I suggest that unless street children are perceived the same on all levels, no adequate solution will be found to the growing problem.","['Cairo', 'Egypt', 'Street Children', 'Governance', 'Agency']"

The Artificially Intelligent Painting Robot PIX18: An Investigation of Man-Machine Artistic Equivalence,"Prats Quintana, Marc","['Lammes, Sybille']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Over the past few months, an increasing number of images and installations produced by artists using artificial intelligence (AI), have sold at major auction houses like Christie’s or Sotheby’s. This suggests that the artificial semi-automated production and reproduction of art is becoming part of established and recognized institutional art circuits. What remains less certain though, is the possibility of AI producing art fully autonomously, that is, without the artist’s input. There are currently several AI image-generating robots created with the aim to be as automatic as possible, among which is PIX18, built by the mechanical engineer Hod Lipson. Allegedly, this machine can apply physical pigment on canvas to make consistently diverse paintings with minimal human intervention. It is so skilled with the brushes, that its by-products have become practically indistinguishable from human-made paintings in aesthetic terms. With that in mind, the aim of this thesis will be to take PIX18 as a case study, and investigate the extent to which its depictions can be seen as artistically equivalent to human art. This will be done by comparing a painting called ‘Frightened Girl’ (2016) made by/with the robot, to another painting titled ‘Woman with a Flowered Hat’ (1963) made by the artist Roy Lichtenstein. In that fashion, this thesis will attempt to answer the following question: to what extent can PIX18’s ‘Frightened Girl’ (2016), be seen as artistically equivalent to Lichtenstein’s ‘Woman with a Flowered Hat’ (1963), and what does this say about current conceptions of art and future considerations of AI? Both paintings are reinterpretations of other images, and will be put in dialogue across two fundamental perspectives, those of the agent who made the paintings, and of the viewer who perceived or perceives them. Potentially, the insights reached in this thesis entail a reconsideration of contemporary art as an exclusively human phenomenon, and a reassessment of how far AI has come in the replication of complex human behaviors.","['artificial intelligence', 'painting', 'Pop art', 'artistic equivalence']"

This thesis will discuss William Butler Yeats’ (1865 – 1939) relationship with his wife, George Yeats “Georgie” (born Bertha Hyde-Lees, 1892 – 1968), his sister, Susan Mary ('Lilly') Yeats (1866-1949), and his business partner, Lady Gregory (1852 – 1932) from the perspective of his language use. The focus will be on the degree of linguistic involvement between Yeats and the women in his life revealed from the letters written by Yeats, during 1917– 1932. This paper will discuss possible style variation in these letters of W.B. Yeats (1865 – 1939). Also, I shall asses the relationships between Yeats and the three different women in his life by analysing the opening and closing formulas. The hypothesis is that the linguistic variation shows the degree of involvement between the man behind the poet and his correspondent. I shall look at the involvement by taking into consideration the usage of markers such as evidential verbs, degree adverbs, and second-person pronouns, while working with Wordsworth Tools 7.0, drawing on previous research, and linking it back to my findings (see e.g. Milroy 1980, Sairio 2005, Tieken-Boon van Ostade 2014, and Bax 2000).","['Linguistics', 'Involvement', 'Relationships', 'Letters', 'W.B.

Brexit Negotiations- Ireland First!

Ireland has more to lose from the UK leaving the EU than other member states. This thesis examines Ireland's vulnerabilities with the implications of a possible return of a hard border in Northern Ireland. In particular, it examines how Ireland has managed to get the issue of the Irish border as a top priority on the EU agenda in the context of the Brexit negotiations. This is achieved using agenda-setting theory and examining the Irish Government use of framing the border issue to EU counterparts. The thesis finds that the Irish Government was extremely proactive, organized and consistent with discourse which resonated with the values of the EU. This discourse was used at a high politics level by Irish politicians in their engagement with officials of EU intuitions and member states. This persistent engagement and discourse with the EU was instrumental in turning the Irish border into a priority for the EU in the Brexit negotiations.","['agenda', 'Ireland', 'Brexit', 'EU', 'European Union', 'frame', 'agenda setting', 'backstop', 'border', 'Northern Ireland', 'peace', 'Irish border', 'Taoiseach']"

Hij benadert autonomie historisch: een persoon is autonoom ten aanzien van een preferentie indien hij factoren die zijn preferenties beïnvloeden niet heeft afgewezen, of niet zou hebben afgewezen indien hij de mogelijkheid had deze preferenties af te wijzen. Benson bekritiseert dit model aan de hand van socialisering. Socialisering doet mensen preferenties niet afwijzen, ook als zij dit wel hadden gedaan zonder socialisering. Wat Benson betreft zijn deze mensen niet autonoom ten aanzien van preferenties die het gevolg zijn van socialisering, ook al hebben zij het proces van socialisering nooit afgewezen. Deze scriptie voegt drie elementen toe aan de discussie. Ten eerste wil wordt Bensons kritiek verbreed door te stellen dat deze niet slechts geldt voor socialisering, maar dat bijna al onze reflectie is beïnvloed door externe factoren. Daarnaast wordt uitgelegd hoe dit betekent dat Christmans model (impliciet) een eigen zelf veronderstelt, los van externe factoren. Tot slot wordt de onenigheid tussen beide auteurs verklaard door te stellen dat beiden een andere intuïtie van autonomie articuleren.","['Auonomy', 'Relational Autonomy', 'Christman', 'Benson', 'Kant', 'Mill']"
"Rethinking the Challenge of Expressing Pain in Language: in literature, theory and medical practice","Liucija, Adomaitė","['Ernst, van Alphen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Elaine Scarry’s The Body in Pain: the Making and Unmaking of the World (1985) proposed an analysis of pain and the concepts of language, imagination, subjectivity, social isolation. This thesis examines the link between language and pain in relation to Scarry’s assumption that it is extremely hard to accurately describe sentient pain in verbal and written forms of expression. Despite pain’s resistance to language, language holds the healing potential of softening pain. The process of “externalization” (the act of externalizing one’s pain into the material world outside the painful inner existence) is a starting point from which the treatment of pain can begin. However, in order to carry out the externalization, one has to express pain in language. I employ three case studies in order to determine whether Scarry’s assumption about pain’s resistance to language can be overcome: Leo Tolstoy’s novel The Death of Ivan Ilyich, Alphonse Daudet’s collection of personal notes In the Land of Pain and a scientific instrument– the McGill Pain Questionnaire. The thesis employs a multidisciplinary approach to pain in which cultural, social and biological aspects are taken into account. It also seeks to re-evaluate the single label of ‘pain’ and proposes to view pain as a multitude of experiences.","['pain', 'subjectivity', 'expression', 'language', 'Scarry', 'Tolstoy', 'Daudet.']"
The representation of Kisaeng in Korean film: the case of Hwang Chin’i,"Thonhauser, Devana","['De Ceuster, Koen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Koreastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Chosǒn society was a patriarchal and hierarchical society. Marriage as a rule was to continue the family line and it was a wives duty to produce a heir. Values like chastity, calmness, and women as ‘good wives and wise mothers’ were important. Interestingly, these rules apparently did not apply in the same manner to kisaeng, courtesans of Korea. Though being of the lowest status in the Chosǒn society, they were trained in arts and trained to uphold conversations with high ranking men. Kisaeng were not celebrated as mothers, they were known and appreciated for their sensual beauty and talent. Over the course of time, the way kisaeng were perceived changed considerably. Where kisaeng were once seen as talented and beautiful distractions for the Yangban, from the colonial period onwards, they became known as elite prostitutes.

These large dams entail complex and multidimensional social impacts on local communities. This thesis assesses the social impacts on the resettled communities affected by the newest developmental project of the World Bank, the Nam Theun 2. Relocation leads to disappearance of traditional practices and the uptake of a modern market-based life style. Deploying the Matrix Framework find that this resettlement is not without its setbacks and impactful changes. Livelihood activities that are far removed from the traditional cultural practices fail to mature, while other activities closer connected to the previous lifestyle performed above expectations in providing villagers with a sustainable source of income. All with all, The World Bank failed to implement sustainable livelihoods for the resettled communities that suited their traditional cultural practices and livelihoods.","['Hydropower', 'Development', 'World Bank', 'Sustainability']"
Gorillas and Guerrillas: Militarised Conservation and Local Livelihoods in the Eastern DRC,"Dings, Zoë","['Stathopoulos, Athanasios']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"National parks in the global South are increasingly marked by a trend of militarised conservation, whereby park rangers receive military training and firearms for anti-poaching operations. Especially in conflict situations where violence poses a security threat to conservation efforts, these policies are justified as an effective solution. This can be attributed to the Western discourse that fuels the politics of conservation and is based on a strict dichotomy between nature and society. Within this discourse, poachers and charcoal producers are characterised as villains and the context and motivations behind their actions is ignored. To exemplify the negative repercussions of this process, this thesis analyses militarised conservation in Virunga National Park in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and argues that this form of nature protection infringes on livelihood strategies of the local people in North Kivu. Militarisation in Virunga is intended to demobilise militias who exploit the park’s natural resources, but has a much stronger impact on the local population, who depend on Virunga’s forests for their livelihoods. These people therefore increasingly collaborate with rebel groups, blurring the lines between ‘good’ and ‘evil’ that the Western conservation discourse is built on. This collaboration leads to further resource exploitation and an escalation of violence. Therefore, this thesis claims that, due to the complexity of the situation in Virunga, militarised conservation is counterproductive and leads to a vicious circle of violence.","['militarised conservation', 'drc', 'livelihoods', 'conflict', 'security', 'Virunga NP']"

“Zoals het hier echt is” De invloed van nabijheid en attitudeconsistentie op gepercipieerde authenticiteit van lokale journalistiek,"Zandbergen, David","['Koetsenruijter, Willem']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Authenticiteit is een belangrijk begrip, ook binnen de journalistiek. Gezien de verzadiging van producten in de markt, zijn (nieuws)consumenten namelijk steeds meer op zoek naar authentieke producten en ervaringen (Gilmore & Pine, 2007). Authenticiteit in de lokale journalistiek wordt vaak gedefinieerd als ‘berichtgeving zoals het echt is om in een bepaalde buurt te leven.’ Dat zou volgens de wetenschap bijvoorbeeld tot uiting komen in het meenemen van veel quotes (Chapman & Nuttall, 2011, p.300) of het meenemen van de ‘stem van de gemeenschap’ in de berichtgeving (Richards, 2013, pp. 637). De focus van dit onderzoek ligt op de lokale journalistiek. Binnen de lokale journalistiek zou deze authenticiteit, gezien het kleinschalige en lokale karakter, een belangrijk en waardevol unique selling point kunnen zijn. Meer kennis over de totstandkoming van waardering bij lokale journalistiek is belangrijk in tijden waarin deze journalistiek het moeilijk heeft (Harte, Howells & Williams, 2019)(De Jong & Koetsenruijter, 2019). Het probleem is echter dat er zeer weinig onderzoek is gedaan naar de manier waarop een gevoel van authenticiteit tot stand komt bij de nieuwsgebruiker en in hoeverre authenticiteit gewaardeerd wordt. Het voorliggende onderzoek richt daarom zich op de vraag hoe de perceptie van authenticiteit in lokale journalistiek tot stand komt en in hoeverre deze wordt gewaardeerd. Dit onderzoek richt zich op twee mogelijke determinanten van gepercipieerde authenticiteit. Ten eerste de perceptie van nabijheid die bij de nieuwsconsument aanwezig is. Dit uit zich enerzijds in nabijheid op basis van de locatie van het nieuws (dit wordt letterlijke nabijheid genoemd), en anderzijds uit zich dit in de persoonlijke betrokkenheid van de nieuwsconsument (figuurlijke betrokkenheid). De tweede determinant is de attitudeconsistentie. Deze variabele uit zich in de deelvraag wat er met de gepercipieerde authenticiteit gebeurdt wanneer de gepresenteerde attitude niet strookt met de eigen opvattingen. Verwacht wordt dat dit voor de lezer geen berichtgeving is ‘zoals het hier echt is’ en daarom als minder authentiek wordt ervaren. Door middel van een online experiment (N = 100) werd onderzocht wat de invloed van nabijheid en attitude is rondom een lokaal journalistiek product op de gepercipieerde authenticiteit van dit product en in hoeverre dit samenhangt met waardering voor dit product. Uit de resultaten bleek dat er twee verschillende soorten authenticiteit bestaan: authenticiteit op basis van herkomst enerzijds en natuurlijke authenticiteit anderzijds. Authenticiteit op basis van herkomst slaat op de authenticiteit die aan het nieuws wordt toegeschreven omdat het uit een bepaalde buurt komt. Natuurlijke authenticiteit slaat terug op een authentieke weergave van de werkelijkheid. Allebei deze soorten authenticiteit hangen samen met een eigen vorm van nabijheid. Natuurlijke authenticiteit hangt samen met nabijheid als nieuwswaarde. 2 Authenticiteit op basis van herkomst hangt samen met persoonlijke betrokkenheid van de lezer bij het onderwerp. Alleen natuurlijke authenticiteit leidt tot extra waardering, authenticiteit op basis van herkomst leidt niet tot extra waardering. Dit is waarschijnlijk doordat de herkomst als inherent wordt ervaren. Dat natuurlijke authenticiteit wél tot extra waardering leidt, bevestigt de wetenschappelijke idee dat een verhoogde perceptie van authenticiteit tot meer waardering leidt. Attitudeconsistentie speelt alleen een rol bij de totstandkoming van waardering als gevolg van natuurlijke authenticiteit. Alleen bij gematigde attitudes is er een relatie tussen gepercipieerde natuurlijke authenticiteit en waardering. Dit is waarschijnlijk doordat authenticiteit als perifere cue werd aangewend tijdens de informatieverwerking. Dat wil zeggen dat deze resultaten er op lijken te wijzen dat authenticiteit vooral bij meer gematigde meningen een rol speelt bij de totstandkoming van waardering, maar dit kan niet enkel door dit onderzoek worden bevestigd. Verder onderzoek rondom authenticiteit als perifere cue wordt aanbevolen.","['Authenticiteit', 'nabijheid', 'lokale journalistiek', 'waardering']"
Kazakhstan’s new capital and legitimacy,"Van der Galiën, Anna","['Bader, Max']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Nur-Sultan, first named Akmola and then Astana, is a planned capital, like Brasília in Brazil, New Delhi in India and Canberra in Australia. This kind of capital has been purposively build in a specific location, mostly due to a better climate or due to an overpopulated area. However, in the case of Astana, the capital was relocated for different and rather undemocratic reasons, as this study finds: to suit the changes of an authoritarian regime in a new independent country. This study offers an explanation for how Kazakhstan’s capital relocation in 1997 has been legitimised by the country’s former president Nursultan Nazarbayev. This is done through a qualitative content analysis of Nazarbayev’s public speeches from 1991 to 2017 as research material, wherein he discusses the capital relocation and its significance. It is found that the new capital is meant to be the showpiece of Kazakh culture and identity; and a symbol of economic prosperity and the regime’s geopolitical vision. In addition, it should become the centre of Central Asia, and also Eurasia, which is in line with the country’s legitimation strategy of i.e. playing the leading role in the Eurasian region.","['Kazakhstan', 'Astana', 'Nursultan Nazarbayev', 'Regime legitimacy', 'planned capital', 'Authoritarian regime']"

Specifically, the focus has been on the Kurdish minstrels, the dengbêjs, and how they reflect the changes undergone by Kurdish nationalism in Turkey. The main argument of this thesis is that the dengbêjs, through their changed importance, are indicative of the changes in Kurdish nationalism itself. It is specifically the rise of the dengbêjs’ popularity in recent years that is discussed. To explore their significance, the first chapter will outline the fundamental concepts of nationalism and collective memory. To provide further understanding of the situation for Kurds in Turkey and why the dengbêjs may be so important, an overview will be provided of Kurdish history and the historical developments of Kurdish nationalism. Finally, the third chapter will discuss the dengbêjs, analyze the developments the minstrel art has gone through, and relate these to the changes in Kurdish nationalism. The dengbêjs form a reminder and a reinvigoration of the Kurdish identity, and elevate the Kurdish language and culture to new levels. The dengbêjs’ popularization is not only a matter of local processes, but equally of global processes affecting nationalism and culture.","['Kurds', 'Nationalism', 'Turkey', 'Dengbêjs', 'Culture']"

In a thorough analysis of the origin and further development of this right and an evaluation of the policy context in which it was developed, three major indications for a path dependent development are identified: (i) the introduction of the right to an individual enforcement of EU law in Van Gend en Loos (VGL) is found to have served as a critical juncture which influenced the subsequent development in a path-defining manner, (ii) the ECJ’s subsequent case-law development of the right is found to have been charaterised by decision-making patterns conforming the original decision in VGL, and (iii) the policy context in which the right was developed is found to have been defined by conditions increasing the likelihood of a path dependence. Finally, this thesis underlines the implications such a path dependent development of case-law has for the ECJ’s case-law itself, its analysis and for EU policy-making on the whole.","['European Court of Justice', 'Path Dependence', 'Direct Effect', 'Van Gend en Loos', 'Courage v Crehan', 'Enforcement of EU Law', 'Individual Enforcement', 'Critical Juncture']"
Where is our kawaii?,"Govea, Lara","['Mes, Tom']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The goal of this thesis is to analyse how consumption is used in the process of identity formation in Japan. It does so through the analysis of the advertisement titled “世界初かわいい味噌汁/Definition of Japanese Kawaii”, produced by Japanses advertising giant Dentsu. Using a framework that was created based on a critical review of literature regarding relevant theories, this thesis analyses three key myths that are part of Japanese national identity: romanticised history, harmless femininity, and international consumption. Three main findings are revealed throughout the analysis. The first is the complex reciprocal relationship between consumption and nation-building myths. The second is the dichotomous relationship between the parts of Japanese identity that are embraced and those that are rejected (these being Westernisation, sexuality, and historical figures). Finally, the analysis reveals that, in the quest to create a distilled, consumable Japanese identity, individual realities are sacrificed. After the conclusion of the findings, the limitations and potential future pathways of the study are suggested.","['japan', 'advertising', 'semiotics', 'identity', 'contructivism', 'Dentsu']"

Mastering the art of swearing in a second language: a three-pronged analysis of swearing behaviour of Dutch L2 learners of English.,"Hoogkamer, Helen Ròbin","['Terkourafi, Marina']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis sets out to explore relationships between attitudes to language learning and context as influential factors on the production, and perceived offensiveness and acceptability of L2 English swearwords. Using a sample of 111 L1 Dutch, L2 secondary school learners of English, this study uses a three-part approach to further understand L2 English swearing behaviour. The participants first completed a production task. In this task they replied to six hypothetical text- messages following a DCT approach that were manipulated on speaker (authoritative/non- authoritative). Following this, they completed an attitudes task consisting of 24 stimuli to be able to shed further light on attitudes to L2 English learning and swearing as possible influential variable on L2 swearing behaviour. Lastly, based on previous studies by Dewaele (2004, 2016, 2017) and Jay & Janschewitz (2008), the participants completed a perception task in which they rated the perceived offensiveness and acceptability of four swearwords in 4 different contexts. These contexts were manipulated on speaker (authoritative/non-authoritative) and location (formal/informal). For the production task, the findings suggest that participants are more likely to use swearwords in a closed-DCT design. Further, an effect of speaker is found as significantly more swearwords were used when the participants were in conversation with a friend rather than a parent. Swearing, however, occurred rather infrequently, which is partly explained by the negative attitudes of the participants to the use of swearwords. Continuing, the results of the perception task revealed significant effects of speaker (p = 0.001) and location (p = 0.005) on offensiveness ratings, and a significant effect of speaker on acceptability ratings (p = 0.001). Further, a strong negative correlation was revealed between offensiveness and acceptability. Lastly, a comparison between the ratings of offensiveness by the participants and native speaker scales of offence (Millwood-Hargrave, 2000; McEnery, 2006; OFCOM, 2016) show that the non-native participants significantly rate offensiveness lower than native speakers. These results re-affirm findings by other researchers such as Dewaele (2004, 2016, 2017) and Jay & Janschewitz (2008), and indicate that ratings of acceptability are largely dependent on ratings of offensiveness.","['Language acquisition', 'Swearing', 'Offensive language', 'Offensiveness', 'ESL', 'Acceptability']"

Towards Social Inclusion?,"Bosch, Bregje","['Amann, Edmund']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"CCTs are a social policy that abides by market logic that underscores self-help and co-responsibility of state and households. However, there is little evidence that human capital promotion results in poverty alleviation. Firstly, because both the quantity and the quality of supply of social services falls short in Latin America. This is particularly the case for poor and hard to reach areas. Nevertheless, governments remain reluctant to invest in social infrastructure due to restricted budgets and political orientation. This creates extra costs and burdens for participants. Secondly, because CCTs have limited concern for gender in its policy design due to male-centered notions of well-being and agency. This tends to reproduce traditional gender roles and complementary intra-household inequalities since women are responsible for the children, working for income and in the home. Thirdly, because CCTs are unjustly perceived as cost-effective due to targeting mechanisms. Targeting is inherently discriminatory and is must follow a simplified perspectives of poverty in order to work. This however, disregards multidimensional aspects of poverty. This indicates that there is room for future study on societal interventions to combat gender inequality while simultaneously reduce structural and inter-generational poverty.Therefore, the research question focus on: How do large scale CCTs affect social inclusive development in Latin America from a feminist perspective?","['Latin America', 'conditional cash transfers', 'Juntos Peru', 'gender perspective', 'critical analysis', 'social policy', 'targeting', 'social capital', 'feminist economics']"
Light up the Darkness: Transforming the Ugandan situation with Non-Violent Methods,"Van der Zanden, Erik","['Leliveld, André']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Highly developed forms of culture, society and political organization were established for thousands of years over the African continent. European colonizers, who conquered most African lands between 1880 and 1913, sliced up the African continent at the Berlin Conference held in 1884-85. The colonial administrations forced the native diversity of governance, culture and society into an artificial mold to ensure the most effective rule for their new colonies. As a result, African societies are not developed but under-developed, remaining stuck within the artificial tribal construction with despotic chiefs. A ‘First Protest Wave’ of decolonization led to freedom from colonial rule, but not to the abolishment of the colonial structures. Rather, it was adopted by the African elites. As the under-developed situation did not change for most of the African nations, a ‘Second Protest Wave’ followed in the 1980’s, and a ‘Third Protest Wave’ even more recently. This third protest wave is still ongoing. The status quo leads to persistent political instability and a jobless economy. The increasingly growing young populations of Africa have no work and are forced in a stage of ‘Waithood’, a concept used to describe the stage of young people unable to get jobs and thus unable to enter the stage of adulthood. Youth stuck in this waithood have generally three modes of action: 1. survival, 2. use of violent methods, and 3. use of non-violent methods. The majorities of studies about youth in Africa have been focusing on youth coping with their situation of waithood, or when they have used violent methods, becoming agents of destruction (Vandals). This study focusses on the third choice, on how youth could become agents of change (Vanguards) using non-violent methods to escape their waithood. Several youth organizations in Uganda are trying to transform their situation with non-violent methods such as peaceful demonstrations, talent workshops, and changing mindsets. They aim at making the people aware, do it together and work on their futures. However, they are actively contained by a sophisticated dictatorship, who uses an intelligence veil to make sure that there is no freedom after speech. This dictatorship has become increasingly adept in camouflaging its internal oppression to the outside world of donors and investors. The sophisticated dictatorship has been provided external legitimacy even though the government is perceived as illegitimate by its own youth. The Ugandan government makes sure that the Darkness is maintained by containing the possible enlightenment and transformation.","['africa', 'colonial legacy', 'dictatorship', 'transformation', 'peaceful methods']"

Civil society organisations such as a NGOs are thus crucial actors in this context. Since they work on a voluntary basis and aim to persuade and mobilise the population, their success depends heavily on the attitudes and beliefs of their audience. Therefore, this thesis discusses the potential of Green Islam for environmental NGOs in Jordan by identifying important aspects that are particular to faith-based environmental activism and applying them to the context of Jordan. It finds that faith-based environmental activism can be helpful for framing, as it renders the issues more relatable to the audience, and provides the organisations with legitimacy derived from a religious discourse. Furthermore, faith-based environmentalism anchors environmental values more deeply on an individual level, which, it is argued, creates stronger incentives for action. Therefore, given the strong presence of Islam in the Jordanian political and societal discourse, the thesis concludes that Green Islam can be valuable for environmental activism in Jordan.","['Environmentalism', 'Green Islam', 'Jordan', 'Environmental NGOs', 'Faith-based activism', 'Middle East']"
Non-trade issues in trade deals The EU-Morocco case,"Belhaj Chankour, Mohamed Amin","['Šćepanović, Vera']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The European Union (EU) is an incomparable actor in international relations. Due to its unique nature, many academics have attempted to define and establish a typology to describe how the EU acts at the world stage. One of the EU’s stronger tools to influence its surrounding countries is its market. Through the carrot of market access and stick of market exclusion, the EU is able to pursue a foreign affairs agenda. This study focusses on the discourse between the EU and its southern neighbour, Morocco, regarding the inclusion of non-trade issues (NTI) in trade agreements. The analysis traces the development of NTIs, by exploring and comparing their role in the two trade deals that have been concluded in the broader context of EU-Morocco relations. The discourse between EU officials and the Moroccan Kingdom is analysed to identify the frame that was employed vis-à-vis NTIs. The analysis demonstrates that both the EU and Morocco employ NTIs. However, the instrumentalisation of NTIs has also proven to be flexible, as they are employed to achieve divergent objectives. On the one hand, the EU portrays itself as a benign organisation that is willing to assist Morocco in its development. On the other hand, Morocco has demonstrated that it drives a hard bargain, as it employs a more business-like discourse in its relationship with the EU than the EU.","['European Union', 'Morocco', 'European Neighborhood Policy', 'Foreign Affairs', 'Trade Conditionality', 'Issue Linkage']"

My research focuses on the EPA between the EU and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and seeks to unravel the discrepancy between the EU’s pledges and the material outcomes of the trade agreement. It is argued that, on the one hand, the EPA tends to benefit the EU environmentally while contributing, on the other hand, to environmental degradation and underdevelopment in the West African region. This aspect of the agreement reinforces the EU’s legitimacy as a political player internally and externally, which makes the EPA part of a European hegemonic project that perpetually sustains structural inequalities in today’s global order. As this paper concludes, the EU’s use of sustainable development as a concept and policy tool is therefore questioned, thereby subverting the effectiveness and legitimacy of its external actions.",
Conquered Castles and Haunted Minds: the Haunted House Motif in Shirley Jackson's We Have Always Lived in the Castle and The Haunting of Hill House as a Vehicle for Exploring the Detrimental Effect of a Patriarchal Ideology on Women,"Fokkink, Nina","['Leeuwen, E.J. (Evert Jan) van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this thesis I explore in what ways Shirley Jackson critiques the position of women in postwar American society in her last two novels: The Haunting of Hill House (1959) and We Have Always Lived in the Castle (1962).In both these novels Jackson takes the idea that a woman's position is in the house literally, and explores the connection between the female protagonists and their Gothic mansions in which they are trapped. In the Hauntíng of Hill House, the apparitions in the house represent the claustrophobic feelings and societal pressures on the protagonist. Whilst in We Have Always Lived in the Castle the destruction of the house by the villagers symbolically represents what the villagers wish to do to the female protagonist in the novel. In order to develop these critical insights, this thesis will engage with feminist theories about the role of women in society written around the time these novels were published, such as Friedan's The Feminine Mystique (1963) and Millett's Sexual Politics (1970), as well as Toril Moi's later discussion of the continued relevance of post-war feminism in Sexual/Textual Polítics (1985). It will relate the feminist theories of women's identity and social role to the dominant patriarchal gender ideology of the time. Other significant contextual sources will be Jackson's o'ftctionalized"" memoirs of her own domestic life: Life Among the Savøges (1952) and Raising Demons (1957). Theories of the Gothic genre's, and in particular the haunted-house sub-genre's, relation to domestic themes will allow me to clarify why Jackson turned to the Gothic as a literary mode through which to express her critique of women's plight in the post-war period.","['Shirley Jackson', 'American Gothic']"
