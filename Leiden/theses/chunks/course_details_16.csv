Increasing Identification With All Humanity Through Dual Identities,"Putten, Veerle van","['Scheepers, D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Migration, the Covid-19 pandemic, and terrorism are some of the global challenges that have great impact and call for worldwide collaboration to address them. Identification with all of humanity (IWAH) could be a promising remedy for the global challenges we face. However, while we may all own the identity ‘human being’, strongly identifying with this category is not self-evident. This study aimed to create more knowledge on whether ‘identification with all humanity’ (IWAH) can be stimulated, while taking into account the optimal distinctiveness theory (Brewer, 1991). The current study examined the possibility of using dual identities, consisting of the human category and more local social categories, to stimulate IWAH, by balancing the need for inclusiveness and distinctiveness. Participants were randomly allocated to one of four conditions varying in the level of abstractness in addition to one control condition. In the four dual identity conditions both the social category ‘humanity’ as one of the local categories (e.g., neighborhood, city/village, Dutch, and European) were made salient. The results showed that a dual identity did not directly influence IWAH, but did show that harmony between both identities did positively correlate with IWAH, namely when the subgroup category had a more abstract character. Furthermore, the results showed that higher levels of IWAH were related to more prosocial behavior.",
Lach en de wereld lacht met je mee! Een experimenteel onderzoek naar de spiegeling van spontaan lachen in een sociale context.,"Overbosch, Sophie","['Zijlstra, T. W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Samenvatting Het is bekend dat mensen en niet-menselijke primaten de spontane lach van hun soortgenoten spiegelen. Tot op heden zijn vergelijkingen tussen onderzoeken bij mensen en bij niet-menselijke primaten lastig te maken, omdat de onderzoeksdesigns doorgaans sterk van elkaar verschillen. Het huidige onderzoek richt zich op het spiegelen van spontaan lachen bij mensen, zodat in de toekomst een vergelijking kan worden gemaakt met spiegeling van spontaan lachen (speelgezicht) bij niet-menselijke primaten. Non-klinische participanten van 18 jaar of ouder (N = 34) hebben naar videobeelden gekeken van kinderen die lachend of neutraal keken. De gezichtsuitdrukkingen van de participanten zijn opgenomen met videocamera’s, om te onderzoeken of ze vaker lachten in de experimentele dan in de controleconditie. Daarnaast is gekeken naar sociale interacties tussen de participanten. De resultaten van de Wilcoxon signed rank toetsen lieten zien dat er significante effecten waren: er werd vaker geglimlacht (z = -3.239, p = .001, r = -.39) en gelachen (z = -2.223, p = .026, r = -.27) in de experimentele dan in de controleconditie. De bevindingen tonen aan dat mensen een spontane lach spiegelen onder de omstandigheden waarin niet-menselijke primaten doorgaans worden getest. In dit onderzoek hebben niet alle participanten een spontane lach gespiegeld. Er wordt gesuggereerd dat de afwijkende testomstandigheden bij mensen en niet-menselijke primaten invloed zouden kunnen hebben op het voorkomen van emotionele spiegeling. In dit onderzoek zijn enkele factoren geïdentificeerd die comparatief vervolgonderzoek tussen mensen en niet-menselijke primaten beter mogelijk zouden kunnen maken. Tevens zijn er enkele aanbevelingen gedaan voor vervolgonderzoek naar emotionele spiegeling bij mensen specifiek.","['Emotionele besmetting', 'emotionele spiegeling', 'niet-menselijke primaten', 'lachen', 'glimlachen']"

The association between neighborhood characteristics and adolescent psychotic experiences,"Moreira João, Amanda","['Blom, J.D.', 'Steenkamp, L.R.', 'Tollenaar, M.S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Psychotic experiences (PEs) occur in up to 30% of children, usually subsiding during adolescence. The presence of PEs alone can lead to mental distress; additionally its persistence can have grave consequences for the child’s development. Neighborhood characteristics are a promising new frontier for research on the development of PEs in childhood and adolescence. The main aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between neighborhood social cohesion, living conditions, objective and perceived safety, and PEs at age 14. The secondary aim was to investigate the relationship of the aforementioned neighborhood factors with the trajectory of PEs from age 10 to 14. We ran a specificity analysis using depressive symptoms to evaluate whether the associations were indicative of a link with general psychopathology or specific psychotic spectrum outcomes. We used the Generation R cohort data on self-reported hallucinations and delusions, and the Wijkprofiel Rotterdam on social, safety, and physical characteristics of the neighborhood. In our multilevel logistic regression analysis, we found no evidence for an association of any neighborhood factors with PEs at age 14. There were trends demonstrating the potential association between living conditions and two outcomes: remission of PEs at age 14, and severe depressive symptoms. However, neither association survived multiple testing correction. We discuss the need for further research to ascertain whether the associations apply to general psychopathology or psychotic spectrum outcomes. Furthermore, we propose the need to clarify new potential associations of neighborhood factors with PEs.","['Psychotic experiences', 'neighborhood characteristics', 'adolescence']"

The Effects of Financial Scarcity on Working Memory Performance,"Poljak, Jelena","['Hilbert, L.P.', 'Ruigendijk, H.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In this study, we hypothesized that the financial scarcity mindset would lead to a lower working memory performance. Additionally, we also hypothesized that a sudden loss of money would lead to lower working memory performance than it would a longer period of financial scarcity. We experimentally induced financial scarcity by a financial task - the Household task and we operationalized working memory performance as participants’ scores on the backwards Corsi task. In an online experiment, 187 adult British participants were randomly assigned to four groups, which varied both in the amount of income they received and whether they received or did not receive a wealth shock. Although none of our hypotheses were confirmed, significant experimental manipulation results proved this study design is valid to use when experimentally inducing financial scarcity. We discussed the results and proposed that incentivizing people should be taken into consideration in future research and practice, as an important factor that might diminish the negative effects of financial scarcity on working memory performance.","['financial scarcity', 'cognitive performance', 'working memory', 'wealth shock']"
How to disclose sponsorship on comparison websites,"Nguyen, Julian","['Lelieveld, G.', 'Stallen, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Comparison websites are on the rise; they have become increasingly well-known under the ordinary consumer. However, what is less well-known, is that comparison websites are making use of sponsorships. This means that the ranking of options is based on a financial agreement between the website and a product provider. Comparison websites should disclose sponsorship. However, the sponsorship disclosure is not always noticed or interpreted by the consumer. Also, there is not one method to disclose sponsorship. Therefore this study compared four different sponsorship disclosures: a thumbs-up icon, an information icon, a paid position tag, and a highlighted tag. The sponsorship disclosures were shown on a mock comparison website for hotels. One of the hotels was sponsored, which was indicated by the sponsorship disclosure. After the participants used the comparison website to make a hotel preference, they were presented a survey. The survey was intended to examine the influence of different ways of sponsorship disclosure on (a) recognizing and understanding the sponsoring, (b) the feeling of being treated fairly, and (c) the purchase behavior and purchase intention. The results showed that textual sponsorship disclosures were better recognized and understood than the sponsorship disclosures by symbols, especially the highlighted paid position tag. Contrary to our expectations, the type of sponsorship disclosure did not influence the perceived fairness, purchase behavior, and purchase intention as we expected. Possible explanations and directions for future research are discussed, as well as practical implications for consumer organizations.",
Is it recognised: Effects of using different symbols for disclosing sponsorship content on price comparison websites,"Cui, Jiatong","['Lelieveld, G.', 'Stallen, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Price comparison websites are a popular medium for consumers to make purchases online. Many of these websites feature sponsored content and they are required to declare the presence of sponsorship. The method of declaration is not standardised which may result in consumer deception. The present study aims to examine the effects of different sponsorship declarations on information comprehension, perceived fairness, purchasing reactions, and perceived information adequacy. In an online survey, 301 participants were presented with a mock hotel comparison website. The sponsorship declaration was provided using different symbols per condition which were a ‘thumbs-up’ and ‘i’ symbol, and ‘paid positioning’ and a highlighted ‘paid positioning’ caption. Participants were asked to evaluate the website, recall the symbol that they had seen, as well as interpret its meaning. Afterwards, participants were explicitly told the disclosure information and were asked to evaluate the website again. The results showed the captions were comprehended much better than the ‘thumbs-up’ and ‘i’ symbol. The different methods of sponsorship disclosure affected purchasing behaviour but not general purchasing intention, fairness, and information adequacy. Explicit explanation of disclosure method resulted in decreased fairness and purchasing intention but increased information adequacy for all conditions. The implications of differing symbol recognition for sponsorship are discussed.",

A race to the bottom?: On the influence of FDI on working conditions in the garment and footwear industry in two Southeast Asian countries,"Donker, Danny","['Chauchard, S.', 'Loughlin, N.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"As globalization furthers, developing states increasingly rely on the inflow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for development. Consequently, scholarly debate has focused on the potential presence of a race to the bottom in labor standards. The race to the bottom thesis assumes as states compete to attract FDI, working conditions will decrease. Literature on the race to the bottom thesis is vast but has yielded mixed results. Traditionally, research has included both developed and developing states and focused on the economy as a whole. This paper transcends previous research by qualitatively studying the effects of FDI on working conditions in the garment and footwear industry in Cambodia and Vietnam. This paper not only focuses on the presence of a race to the bottom, but also what it looks like and what might be other factors of influence. Additionally, this research attempts to place the race to the bottom into the broader debate on neoliberal capitalist development. This paper has found that although macro-trends in the global economy indicate a race to the bottom, comparative research on Cambodia and Vietnam shows that compliance is generally high. However, cost-cutting measures are still observed in the composition of the labor force, contracts, and oppression of organized labor.",

Sharing rather than caring: Research into the motives underlying (possible harmful) sharing behavior online,"Togt, Renske van der","['Bommel, M. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In this master’s thesis, the underlying motivations for sharing videos of others’ misfortunes online was investigated. In an (2x2 between-subjects) online study, 132 participants (64% female) watched three videos and answered questions about schadenfreude, mortality salience, fundamental needs, online sharing behavior, and empathy. In the first three hypotheses the influence of worldview on schadenfreude and sharing behavior is researched. Hypothesis 3-6 investigates the influence of mortality salience on fundamental needs and sharing behavior. In addition, exploratory analysis to test the influence of gender and empathy on schadenfreude, and a possible moderation effect is presented. The results were mostly non-significant. Based on the results, a different design of the study is proposed. We have laid groundwork in the field of the relative new area of behavior; how people behave online. It is advised that further research be conducted on this topic of new area behavior. An experiment measuring actual behavior and not only intentions and assumptions of people is recommended for further scientific insight on this topic.",

Everyday mind reading: The effect of eye gaze behavior on empathic accuracy and the differences between males and females,"Ramyad, Angela","['Wever, M.', 'Beurs, E. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Empathic accuracy and eye contact form the foundation of everyday human social interaction. Here, the association between the duration of eye gaze fixation of the perceiver on the eye region of the target and the level of empathic accuracy when presented with dynamic emotional video stimuli was examined and it was determined whether gender plays a role in this association. In this study, 110 participants had their gaze behavior tracked while watching ten 180-seconds during videoclips of strangers telling an emotional autobiographical story. Participants had to rate the target’s feelings at the moment of recording the videoclip and their own feelings. It was hypothesized that people that spend more time fixating on the eye region of strangers have a higher level of empathic accuracy than people that spend less time fixating on the eye region of strangers and that this relationship differs between males and females. Linear regression analyses did not reveal significant evidence for a relationship between eye gaze behavior and empathic accuracy that is moderated by gender. Gaining more insight in the topic of eye gaze behavior, gender and empathic accuracy is still so valuable for the improvement in treatment for empathy-related difficulties and atypical gaze patterns that some individuals have to deal with in their daily life.",

When decisions matter most - the effects of self-referent pressure on approach-avoidance tendencies,"Choy, Pascal","['Zech, H.G.', 'Dillen, L.F. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In everyday life, people have developed tendencies to either approach or avoid certain stimuli. Approach tendencies are elicited by positive stimuli, while avoidance tendencies are elicited by negative stimuli. This is called the approach-avoidance effect. In high-performance environments, approach and avoidance tendencies play a decisive role in succeeding or failing, or, in extreme cases, in living or dying. Moreover, in these environments, approach and avoidance tendencies are often present under self-relevant pressure. Hence, this research studied the effects of self-relevant pressure on approach and avoidance tendencies. Based on existing literature from the field of decision-making psychology and performance psychology, we hypothesized that we would replicate the approach-avoidance effect. Also, we expected that pressure would impair participants’ performance and would influence the approach-avoidance effect. Fifty-one participants completed the mobile approach-avoidance task (AAT), once with and once without pressure, and filled out a pressure questionnaire after each mobile AAT. In the mobile AAT, participants were shown pictures of happy and sad faces and were asked to push or pull them according to specific instructions. We indeed replicated the approach-avoidance effect (p < .001). However, our pressure manipulation was unsuccessful. Hence, participants did not perform worse under self-relevant pressure. Subsequently, we did not find that pressure influenced the approach-avoidance effect. Although most of the hypotheses were rejected due to the failed pressure manipulation, the present study is a springboard for future research on decision-making under self-relevant pressure. Finally, implications are discussed and directions for future research are provided.",

Patterns that can be seen in a person’s word use can reflect markers which can indicate symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Studies showed that stressors can have an impact on a person’s word use and reveal symptoms of psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to investigate linguistic changes in individuals with a psychiatric disorder during the Covid-19 pandemic. Blog posts of Dutch, English and German female bloggers with a psychiatric disorder and those without a psychiatric disorder were used to analyse changes in first-person singular and plural personal pronouns, negative and positive emotion words and cognitive processing words. Furthermore, the changes over time in these word categories were assessed by means of random-effects meta-analyses over cases. It appeared that patients used more first-person singular and plural personal pronouns and cognitive processing words compared to the control group. There were no changes over time in the emotional tone of the blog posts between the patients and the controls. However, patients had a more negative or a less positive tone during Covid-19 compared to before the pandemic. To conclude, patients were more focused on themselves as well as on others and may have been more preoccupied with cognitive processes than the control group. It was also evident that patients were perhaps more likely to experience negative emotions during stressors such as the Covid-19 pandemic.",

"As the Twig is Bent, so is the Tree Inclined: Missing Data in Generalized Linear Mixed-Model (GLMM) Trees","Weerman, Nino","['Dusseldorp, E.', 'Fokkema, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: The Generalized linear mixed-model (GLMM) tree is a decision-tree method which allows for subgroup detection in a wide range of multilevel datasets. This thesis provides a first evaluation of how missing data can be handled in GLMM trees, by assessing the performance of listwise deletion (LD), mean or mode single imputation (SI), multiple imputation (MI) and missingness incorporated in attributes (MIA), in terms of predictive accuracy and tree size accuracy. Method: Different missingness mechanisms, proportions of missing cases and missing data were artificially introduced into data retrieved from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten class of 1998-1999. Results: As expected, MI yielded the highest performance overall, closely followed by MIA, which exhibited an approximately similar performance. SI performed somewhat worse than MIA and MI, whereas LD showed a substantially inferior performance. Individually, MI and MIA performed very similar for lower amounts of missing data, MI slightly outperformed MIA for higher amounts of missing data, missing completely at random (MCAR) and missing at random (MAR) data and MIA slightly outperformed MI for MNAR (missing not at random) data. When comparing the size of fitted GLMM trees with those fitted on the complete data, MI tended to overfit and yield ensembles of more complex trees, whereas LD, SI and MIA tended to underfit and yield simpler decision trees. Furthermore, the performance of LD was lowest across all conditions and deteriorated even further as the number of cases with missing increased. Conclusion: For handling missing data in GLMM trees, MI is recommended predominantly for prediction purposes, but lacks interpretability. Alternatively, MIA is recommended for interpretability and when a smaller tree size is preferred. Conversely, using either LD or SI is discouraged, even though SI is preferred over LD.",
The Buffering Effect of Parental Bonding on the Relationship between Child Maltreatment and Adult Psychopathology,"Kaburis, Melina","['Kullberg, M.', 'Elzinga, B.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: Child maltreatment poses a severe global concern and has been identified as an influential factor in the trajectory of psychopathology. Given that parental bonding has a direct effect on depressive symptoms, and buffers adversity-related pathogenesis, the current study aimed to investigate whether child maltreatment is related to elevated levels of adult depression, and whether parental bonding (maternal and paternal bonding respectively) has a moderating effect on this relationship. In addition, within the context of intrafamilial abuse, the current study aimed to investigate the buffering effect of parental bonding when the abuse is linked to the perpetrating versus the non-perpetrating parent. Method: The study’s data was obtained from NESDA, an ongoing longitudinal cohort study. Information of 2069 participants, on depressive symptoms, parental bonding (at the 9-year follow up) and childhood trauma (assessed at baseline), was collected using self-reports and interviews. Results: The findings reveal that all four types of child maltreatment yielded a positive correlation with depressive symptoms. Furthermore, maternal bonding did have a moderating effect on the relationship between child maltreatment (physical and sexual abuse) and adult depression. The buffering effect of optimal maternal bonding was however stronger when maltreatment was absent. Moreover, paternal bonding did not moderate the relationship between child maltreatment and adult depression. Lastly, the impact of parental bonding was linked to the non-perpetrating parent. Conclusion: The yielded findings extend prior research on the association between child maltreatment and adult psychopathology, and the impact of parental bonding on this relationship. These findings highlight the importance of promoting optimal parental bonding",

"Childhood maltreatment is associated with internalizing psychopathology in adulthood, but the relationship is not mediated by inflammation: a cross-sectional study","Gorišek, Saša","['Tollenaar, M.S.', 'Mouthaan, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Exposure to childhood maltreatment (CM) can induce hyperactive inflammatory responses, which can persist into adult life. Elevated levels of inflammation markers can impair brain functioning and development, which can in turn increase the risk for psychopathology. Hence, inflammation might be one of the potential mechanisms explaining the link between CM and adult psychopathology. Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether inflammation might mediate the relationship between CM and internalizing psychopathology in adulthood. Additionally, the study aimed to determine whether this effect is specific to one or more subtypes of CM. Methods: A total of 116 adults participated in the study. CM was assessed using a combination of two questionnaires: the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS-PC) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Participants’ saliva samples were analysed for three pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α). The Internalizing Problems subscale from the Adult Self Report (ASR) questionnaire was used to determine internalizing psychopathology. Parallel mediation analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses. Results: Experienced childhood abuse and neglect both significantly predicted internalizing symptoms in adulthood. However, the associations were not mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: This study’s findings add to the extensive body of literature showing the longterm effects of CM on internalizing psychopathologies. Contrary to expectations, the mediation effect of inflammation in this relationship was not identified. As several methodological factors could have influenced the results, this outcome should not be considered as a firm disconfirmation of the mediation hypothesis. Further prospective studies addressing this question are warranted.","['childhood maltreatment', 'inflammation', 'pro-inflammatory cytokines', 'internalizing psychopathology', 'mediation']"

The Mediating Role of Psychotic Like Experiences in the association of Peer Victimization and Bullying Perpetration in Youth,"Elzobeydi, Sarah","['Ruitenberg, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Being bullied has shown to negatively influence the normal development. Victims of bullying may develop a disrupted image of the social world. According to the social defeat hypothesis of psychosis, being mistreated by other people, changes how the brain functions, which manifest in psychotic like experiences. These experiences (e.g. seeing or hearing things that are not there), are probably the first signs of a lifelong psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. The first aim of this study was to test this hypothesis in in a high-risk group (youth with a greater chance to develop a psychiatric disorder). This study offers support for the social defeat hypothesis of psychosis, as the results indicated that being bullied is associated with more psychotic like experiences. It is however possible that the same factors (e.g. genes) that caused PLEs, increased the chance of being bullied. In this case the association is not due to social defeat. One study found that youth with PLEs were more likely to bully others compared to youth without PLEs. Therefore, the second aim of this study was to investigate whether being socially defeated by being bullied, causes youth to bully others. The results showed that being bullied was associated with bullying others. However, having PLEs was not associated with bullying others. It is possible that being socially defeated by peers, only leads to PLEs in youth with psychosis liability (genetically a greater chance to develop a psychotic disorder), while leading to bullying others in youth without psychosis liability. Another explanation is that bullying others when being bullied yourself, has other underlying reasons then social defeat (e.g. learned to become the bully). By including factors that increase the risk for PLEs in future research, the role of social defeat on PLEs can be further investigated.",

Within a RCT, participants were randomised to receive either MBCT or TAU over 8 weeks. Subjects completed online questionnaires assessing demographics, mindfulness (Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire) and anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory; BAI, Fear Questionnaire; FQ) at baseline, midterm, post-test and follow-up. The aims were investigated using baseline and post-test data for analysis. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed that MBCT significantly reduced worry and anxiety measured by the FQ, increased mindfulness, and that it was more effective in reaching these outcomes than TAU. Scores on anxiety measured by the BAI also improved significantly, however, results indicated no difference between groups. Mediation analyses identified a mediating role of worry between mindfulness and anxiety if anxiety was measured by the FQ, but not if it was measured by the BAI. These results demonstrate a superiority in treatment effectiveness of MBCT over TAU, next to establishing MBCT’s effectiveness for patients with anxiety disorders who did not respond to their first treatment. The mixed findings on anxiety suggest that mindfulness may be more relevant to symptoms of behavioural avoidance than to somatic symptoms of anxiety, emphasising a need for further investigation. The present results contribute meaningfully to available literature in the field, promoting treatment optimisation in the long-term.","['Mindfulness', 'MBCT', 'worry', 'treatment-resistant anxiety', 'anxiety disorders']"
"Is a nonconforming reputational style in adolescents with MBID related to risk-taking, substance use and delinquency?","Meijerink, Pien","['Bexkens, A.', 'Vogelaar, B.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Adolescents with a mild to borderline intellectual disability (MBID) tend to be more vulnerable, especially in the social domain. This causes them to present more risk-taking behaviour, use more substances and show more delinquent behaviour. Consequently, they end up in the criminal circuit more than the non-MBID group. The Reputation Enhancement Theory could explain why adolescents with MBID are presenting more delinquent behaviours than those without the disorder. This research investigated whether a nonconforming reputational style in adolescents with MBID is related to risk-taking, substance use and delinquency. 352 male students of high schools participated in filling out the questionnaires. Specific factors of the Reputation Enhancement Scale (RES) were analysed to see if they predicted high scores on the Self-reported delinquency scale (SRDS), Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (RAPI) and Adolescent Risk-taking Questionnaire, behavioural part (ARQ behaviour). Differences between MBID are non-MBID were also analysed. Results showed that for adolescents with MBID and a nonconforming reputational style, their communication to peers was related to SRDS. So, more research is needed to substantiate these primary results.",
Can differences in interoception explain emotion recognition impairments associated with alexithymia and autistic traits?,"Fenten, Jan","['Nikolić, M.', 'Folz, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"While a general emotion recognition impairment in autistic individuals has been suggested in the past, more recent findings propose that alexithymia plays a major role in this relationship. Interoception has been theorized to be a factor explaining interindividual differences in emotion recognition and possibly mediating the relationship between alexithymia and emotion recognition. Both alexithymia and autism, have been found to be negatively related to measures of interoception. Therefore, we investigated whether alexithymia, not autism, would be a significant predictor of emotion recognition performance and hypothesized that trait levels of autism and alexithymia would be negatively related to measures of interoception. Additionally, we explored whether interoception mediates the expected negative relationship between trait levels and emotion recognition. A total of 100 participants completed a naturalistic emotion recognition task, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Cambridge Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), the Interoceptive Accuracy Scale (IAS), and the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ) in an online environment. Our hypotheses regarding the relationship between trait levels and emotion recognition, as well as interoception as a mediator, were not supported. However, in line with our expectations, we did observe a marginally significant effect indicating a negative relationship between interoception and alexithymia. Overall, our findings endorse research that links interoception with alexithymia and hence, provide an indication of why alexithymia, not autism, could be a mechanism in emotion recognition impairments. However, to understand the interplay between all factors more thoroughly, further research is necessary. We discuss how an improved understanding could have important implications for the conceptualization of autism.","['Emotion recognition', 'alexithymia (hypothesis)', 'autism', 'interoception']"
Depression and anxiety symptoms in a migraine cohort,"Haasteren, Marloes van","['van Houdt, C.', 'van den Hoek, T.', 'Klaassens, B.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"A strong association between migraine and depressive and anxiety symptoms is suggested. The association is found for chronic migraineurs, migraineurs with aura symptoms and migraineurs with medication overuse. The objective of the current study was to confirm whether anxiety and depression symptoms are related to the frequency of headache attacks, the presence of aura symptoms and medication overuse. This is the first study that differentiated between somatic and non-somatic symptoms of anxiety and depression within a migraine cohort. All participants were retrieved from the LUMINA (Leiden University Medical Centre Migraine Neuro-Analysis Program). Depressive and anxiety symptoms were compared between patients with chronic migraine (315), patients with episodic migraine (1825) and controls (431). Comparison between migraineurs with aura (779) and without aura (1361) was performed with the same migraine patients from the LUMINA database. To determine if migraine patients meet the criteria for overuse, the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3) was used. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (non-somatic symptoms) and the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ) (somatic symptoms) were used to measure anxiety and depression symptoms. Multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVAs) were conducted to compare anxiety and depression symptoms between groups. The results showed that migraine patients, chronic and episodic, differed significantly (p < .001) from healthy controls for all subscales of the HADS and the MASQ-D30. Migraine patients with a higher frequency (chronic migraineurs) of headache attacks reported more anxiety and depression symptoms compared with less frequent headache attacks (episodic migraineurs) (p < .001). The anxiety symptoms were only significant different for the somatic symptoms (MASQ-D30 SA), non-somatic symptoms of anxiety did not differ between chronic and episodic migraineurs. Migraineurs with aura symptoms did not report more depression and anxiety symptoms than migraineurs without aura (p > 0.05). Patients with an overuse of analgesics showed significantly more somatic symptoms of anxiety, as measured with the MASQ-D30 SA subscale (p< 0.001). Overuse of triptan and ergotamine did not report significant differences for the subscales compared with normal use. Effect sizes for all analyses showed a small effect. In conclusion, this study showed an association between headache frequency, analgesic overuse and depression and anxiety symptoms. This study shows the importance of differentiating between somatic and non-somatic questionnaires for measuring anxiety and depression. The results show that predictors can cause effects on different domains of anxiety and depression, either somatic or non-somatic. Medical professionals should pay attention to the overuse of analgesics and a high attack frequency because these might be risk factors for developing depression and somatic anxiety symptoms.

Sorry or Silly: How Managerial Responses to Angry Online Reviews Affect Reviewer and Company Appraisal,"Reivala, Erika","['Lelieveld, G.', 'Steinel, W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous studies on online reviews have mostly concentrated on how the evaluations of products or services are affected by negative commentary. More recent studies have expanded the field of online reviews to investigate readers’ appraisals of the reviewer themselves based on their online comments. Most of this work focused on the effects of anger and showed that anger expressions have detrimental effects on the perceptions of the reviewer and on the informative value of the review. The current research examined whether this is always the case. Building on past findings, this study set out to investigate the effect of managerial responses to angry online reviews on appraisals of the service and the reviewer. This study created three differential managerial response conditions (apologetic, humorous, no response) to an angry online review of an imaginary hotel, and measured review informativeness, reader attitude, appropriateness of emotion, rationality of the reviewer, and the likelihood of the reader to book the reviewed hotel. Data were gathered with an online questionnaire (N = 121). Results found that apologetic responses heightened both reviewer informativeness and rationality appraisals and improved readers’ attitudes towards the service. This study thus concludes that the presence and type of managerial response to angry online reviews do have an effect on how the reviewed product or service is evaluated, and how both the review and the reviewer are perceived.",
The art of apologizing: The Impact of Managerial Responses on the Perceived Helpfulness of Online Angry Reviews,"Bicaj, Bleona","['Lelieveld, G.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Using previous research as a basis, the current research elaborates on the effect of online angry reviews, in cases when a managerial response is visibly provided with the review. Respondents were shown an online angry review that received either an apologetic managerial response or a humorous managerial response. Study results revealed that a managerial response provided to the angry review would moderate the effect and intensity of perceived anger. Specifically, it was found that apologetic managerial responses caused the review to be perceived as more helpful, and the reviewer as more rational, when compared to angry reviews with no response. However, no significant differences were observed when comparing apologetic with humorous managerial responses. Yet, respondents held more positive attitudes about the company after viewing an apologetic, rather than humorous, managerial response. This research provides beneficial implications, namely that it moderates the previously held opinion that anger always backfires in online reviews, and it puts emphasis on apologetic responses as a type of response that managers should provide to ease the angry review directed at them.",
Parental empathic accuracy and the role of parental childhood emotional neglect,"Bree, Sarah de","['Elzinga, B.', 'Wentholt, W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Childhood emotional neglect (CEN) can lead to problems in parenting. Parents with a history of CEN can have difficulties recognizing and labelling emotions. Our research question is: is a history of CEN in parents associated with reduced empathic accuracy (EA) towards their children? Our sample consisted of 74 mothers and 62 fathers (N = 136) and their children. We measured CEN with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Bernstein et al., 1998). We measured general EA with a computer task by Aan Het Rot (2014), consisting of videoclips in which persons talked about an emotional experience. Parents rated the emotional valence of the persons continuously. We measured parental EA using a parent-child interaction task that was videotaped. The children rated their emotions and their parents rated their child’s emotions. Results showed no significant association between a history of CEN and general EA. In contrast, parents who reported more CEN significantly underestimated positive and overestimated negative emotions of their child. No significant gender differences were found. In conclusion, the more CEN is reported by parents, the more negatively they interpret the emotional state of their child. We speculate that a parent with a history of CEN is more empathically concerned and worries more excessively over the well-being of their child. This could be a disadvantage in caregiving, it could lead to overprotection of the child, which is not good for a child’s self-confidence. Future research could investigate whether children are more prone to depression when their parents interpret their emotions more negatively.",

Het aanpassen van de opmaak van een tekst kan mogelijk leiden tot een hogere leessnelheid en een hoger tekstbegrip. Beeline Reader is een digitale web extensie, waarbij gebruik gemaakt wordt van kleurovergangen in de tekst, waardoor het leesproces mogelijk verbeterd wordt, om zo het tekstbegrip te verhogen. In het huidige onderzoek is onderzocht in hoeverre traditionele opmaakfactoren van een tekst (regelafstand en regellengte) en het gebruik van Beeline Reader invloed hebben op het leesproces van ervaren lezers (N =21). Dit is onderzocht door het uitvoeren van een leestaak, bestaande uit acht teksten, vier teksten in combinatie met Beeline Reader en vier teksten in Zwart-Wit. Door middel van eyetracking is het leesproces van de lezers onderzocht. Uit het onderzoek komt naar voren dat Beeline Reader geen invloed heeft op het leesproces (totale leessnelheid, duur van de eerste lezing, duur van de tweede lezing) en het tekstbegrip. Teksten met een dubbele regelafstand zorgen voor een hogere leessnelheid ten opzichte van een enkele regelafstand, zolang deze maar gecombineerd is met een lange regellengte. Mogelijk komt dit door ‘crowding’ effecten. Tevens wordt er sneller gelezen bij teksten met een korte regellengte, zolang deze gecombineerd worden met een enkele regelafstand. Geconcludeerd kan worden dat traditionele opmaakfactoren van de tekst invloed hebben op het leesproces van ervaren lezers, maar dat dit afhankelijk is van hoe de regelafstand en regellengte zijn gecombineerd.","['begrijpend lezen', 'tekstopmaak', 'regelafstand', 'regellengte', 'Beeline Reader', 'leessnelheid', 'eerste lezing', 'tweede lezing', 'return sweeps', 'tekstbegrip']"

The relationship between cognitive functioning and fatigue in low grade glioma patients: An exploratory study,"Boere, Robin","['Hiele, K. van der', 'Schuitema, I.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: Cancer-related fatigue is defined as a persistent, subjective sense of tiredness related to cancer and cancer treatment that interferes with usual functioning. In addition to confirming the well-known presence of fatigue in patients with low-grade glioma (LGG), this study investigated whether patients suffered from cognitive impairment, and whether this cognitive impairment was related to the experienced fatigue. Method: Due to the exploratory nature of this study many outcome measures were investigated in order to map the possible factors related to experienced levels of fatigue. We therefore chose to perform descriptive statistical analyses. Fatigue and different subscales of fatigue (mental fatigue, physical fatigue, decreased motivation, decreased activity and general fatigue) were measured with the self-report Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory. In order to measure neuropsychological functioning all patients completed a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests selected to cover a broad range of cognitive functions, including attention and concentration, executive functioning, and memory. Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare severely fatigued patients to non-severely fatigued patients in order to analyse whether their performance on neuropsychological testing differed. In addition, we also examined whether severely fatigued patients differed from non-severely fatigued patients in characteristics, time post diagnosis, tumor location and treatment. These analyses were only performed for mental and physical fatigue. Results: Thirty-one adult patients (mean age, 44 years; 21 males [68%]) with a confirmed LGG and a mean time post diagnosis of 2.5 years were included in this study. Severe mental fatigue prevalence rates were reported by 17/31 (55%) patients, whereas 9/31 (29%) patients reported severe physical fatigue. Sixteen percent of the patients reported both severe mental and physical fatigue. Cognitive impairments (t-score < 40) were predominantly observed in the domain of attention and concentration (21.9%), and to a lesser extent in the domains of memory (15.8%) and executive functioning (10.3%). Significant differences (p < .05) between severely mental fatigued patients and non-severely mental fatigued patients were found on 4/14 (29%) cognitive tests. Concerning the physical fatigued patients and non-severely physical fatigued patients, significant differences (p < .05) were found on 2/14 (14%) cognitive tests. Conclusion: Our data demonstrated that LGG patients showed high levels of experienced fatigue, especially in the domain of mental fatigue, when compared to healthy individuals, which might partially be explained by impairment in cognitive functions, which where predominantly observed in the domain of attention and concentration. Additional research is needed to identify what other factors might cause increased levels of experienced fatigue in patients with LGG.",

Rejection constitutes one of the main behaviors that affect the socioemotional adjustment of the child. Existing literature suggests that low educated parents are more rejecting, while their children show higher levels of internalizing problems compared to their peers. Even though parents constitute the most significant others of the child, as children grow older, they become more functionally autonomous. In the current study, three analyses were conducted to examine the correlation between parental rejection and internalizing problems exclusively in observed parent-child interactions (k = 20, N = 3.689), parental educational level as a confounder of the latter correlation (k = 12, N = 1.579) and children’s age as a possible moderator (k = 19, N = 2.613). Results show positive effects for the correlation between rejection and internalizing problems (ES = .11). Both moderator analyses were insignificant. In the future, it is necessary to examine the individual effect of parental educational level on rejecting behaviors and internalizing problems. More studies are needed to examine whether the strength of the correlation between parental rejection and internalizing problems alters based on diverse developmental stages of the child.","['parental rejection', 'internalizing problems', 'parental educational level', 'early childhood', 'middle childhood', 'adolescence']"

Can moral emotional frames polarize your attitude?

Felt emotions and moralization are hypothesised to mediate the effect, because experiencing moral emotions should makes people moralize an issue, which in turn can cause attitude polarization. However, the results did not support the hypotheses, as the frames did not impact attitude polarization, neither by mediation through moralization and felt emotions.. However, when conveyed emotions were used instead of the frames, anger, disgust and even fear and anxiety predicted attitude polarization through mediation by moralization and felt emotions. The results also indicate that moralization predicts attitude polarization. The study provides opportunities for future research that are elaborated on in the discussion.",

The Role of Self Efficacy and Dispositional Optimism in Conditioned Pain Modulation,"Reisgies, Helena","['Veldhuijzen, J.', 'Reijnders, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Recent research proposes that psychological factors might influence individuals’ pain experiences via descending endogenous pain modulation. This can be studied using the experimental paradigm of conditioned pain modulation (CPM). Two types of psychological variables suggested to influence individuals’ pain experience are self-efficacy beliefs and dispositional optimism. It is further proposed that self-efficacy might predict dispositional optimism. The present study aims to investigate whether self-efficacy and dispositional optimism affect individuals’ CPM response. The primary research question asks whether the influence of self-efficacy on CPM is mediated by dispositional optimism. This is investigated by three hypotheses: First, self-efficacy affects CPM; second, dispositional optimism affects CPM; third, dispositional optimism mediates the effect of self-efficacy on CPM. The provisional research question asks whether verbal suggestions are effective in changing self-efficacy beliefs and is tested with a hypothesis stating that verbally manipulation self-efficacy is successful. Participants (N = 17) are university students or adults, randomly grouped into a high versus low self-efficacy condition in which they are accordingly manipulated. The Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) is administered to measure dispositional optimism. The CPM paradigm is executed using an algometer and the cold-pressor test as stimuli. The primary hypotheses are analysed using linear regression and the PROCESS macro procedure. The results were not statistically significant at p ≤ .05 and, followingly, neither of the hypotheses could be confirmed. However, secondary findings might potentially point towards an effect of self-efficacy on CPM (β = .17) and dispositional optimism on CPM (β = .15). The provisional hypothesis, tested using a one-way ANOVA, revealed non-significant results at p ≤ .05. Thus, the manipulation of self-efficacy was not successful. The present research represents one of the first studies investigating the role of self-efficacy and dispositional optimism in CPM. The current findings suggest that future research into this field is highly needed. This would help to uncover the impact of self-efficacy and dispositional optimism on CPM or to show that a different approach including other psychological variables is more suitable. Investigating the field of CPM further could help to improve pain treatments and prevent the development of persistent pain conditions.","['pain', 'conditioned pain modulation', 'self-efficacy', 'dispositional optimism']"
Cognitive load in a naturalistic setting: A cross-modal visual load and auditory evoked potential study,"Snoeks, Michelle","['Ghosh, A.', 'Band, G.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Scientific research seldom focuses on naturalistic approaches of investigating selective attention in sensory modalities, even though being able to selectively pay attention to a stimulus is important in real life. The current cross-modal ERP study illustrates the importance of addressing naturalistic environments and tasks in behavioral and ERP research regarding auditory selective attention and cognitive load. Instead of using a standardized cognitive load task, smartphone interactions were used to indicate whether or not someone was engaged in the visual and tactile modality. During the task, a sound with a duration of 50 msec and an interstimulus interval (ISI) of one to three seconds was administered to the participants (n = 14). Following the ideas of load theory, we hypothesized that in the “during smartphone use” condition, there will be a larger N1 peak than in the “while not using the smartphone” condition. There were no significant larger N1 peaks in the “during smartphone use” condition compared to the “while not using the smartphone” condition. A possible explanation for this lack of N1 amplitude modulation could be the difference between the usual unnatural study settings in behavioral and ERP research, where load induced alterations are prevalent, and the naturalistic context of the current study. For future research it would be interesting to investigate cognitive load and selective attention cross-modally in a nonlaboratory setting, with tasks that have been validated to induce cognitive load.","['naturalistic research', 'load theory', 'cognitive load', 'ERP', 'auditory selective attention', 'EEG', 'N1']"
Landmark recognition: What makes a landmark familiar?,"Jarva, Henrietta","['Ham, C.J.M. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous research has found variation in navigation ability among healthy individuals. Instead of focusing on individual differences, the current online experiment compared performance across individual landmarks. Since landmarks work as reference points, navigation could be facilitated by considering their appearance and placement. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether perceptual saliency and the serial-position effect influence landmark recognition in healthy individuals. It was expected that perceptually salient landmarks with a significant height, a complex shape or a salient location would be perceived as more familiar than neutral landmarks. It was also expected that because of the serial-position effect, landmarks presented first and last should be perceived as more familiar than those in the middle. In total, 63 participants, aged between 18 and 35, completed the experiment. Participants saw a navigation video followed by a landmark recognition task. They had to judge whether landmarks were “new” or “familiar” (i.e., shown in the video). For familiar landmarks, they rated the level of familiarity on a 5-point Likert scale. The results showed that landmark recognition was affected by perceptual saliency, which increased the chances that landmarks were recognized as familiar. Salient landmarks were also rated higher in familiarity than neutral landmarks. The findings suggested that the last landmarks were perceived as the most familiar, which provided evidence for the recency effect. However, an overlap between saliency and the serial-position effect might have affected these results. Thus, more research is needed to confirm whether the serial-position effect affects landmark recognition. In conclusion, both saliency and the serial-position effect should be considered when designing landmarks for different environments. Human navigation could be facilitated by including these factors in guidelines for landmark design.",
The Link Between Parenting and Adolescent Negative Mood in Daily Life: Moderated by Cognitive Emotion R egulation in Adolescents,"Haan, Niels den","['Janssen, L.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Negative parental behaviour and lack of positive parental behaviour is related to more adolescent negative mood. However, not much research has been done on how fluctuations of parental behaviour relate to fluctuations of adolescent negative mood in daily life. This study aimed to investigate the within-person link between parental criticism and warmth and negative mood of adolescents in daily life. Moreover, it aimed to examine to which extent adolescents would differ in this link and if emotion regulation would explain these differences. Daily diary data from a sample of 80 Dutch adolescents (63.7% female, Mage = 15.90) was used. The sample completed ecological momentary assessments (EMA) for 14 consecutive days. Results of multilevel models revealed that, on average, adolescents experienced more negative mood on days when they perceived more criticism from their mother, but not from their father. Further, adolescents experienced less negative mood on days when they perceived more parental warmth. Considerable individual differences were found between adolescents in the link between daily negative mood and parental warmth. Individual differences were only partly explained by rumination regarding the link between daily negative mood and warmth of mothers. These results suggest that previous findings regarding the link between parenting and adolescent negative mood can be generalized to daily life. Also, the unique characteristics of adolescents should be considered in the development of preventive interventions.",

A significant indirect effect was found to support the mediating role of shame between a negatively framed message and a decreased intention to purchase plastic product. High levels of guilt and pride correlated significantly with decreased intention to purchase plastic products. However, there was no evidence found to support the mediating role of these emotions between message valence and intention to purchase. Lastly, the level of environmental concern was taken into account as a possible moderator between message valence and self-conscious emotions, though no evidence was found to support this hypothesis. These findings have theoretical and practical implications for using message framing in reducing plastic consumption.",

Previous studies have shown that negative framed messages have a general stronger effect than positive framed messages on achieving a desired behaviour in other domains however, little is known about which messages valence is best when encouraging pro-environmental behaviours. Contributing to research on encouraging pro-environmental behaviours regarding plastic consumption, data from 98 respondents, who were randomly assigned to either a ‘positive no efficacy’ condition or a ‘negative no efficacy’ condition, was analysed. The independent samples t-test showed no significant evidence for believing that a positive framed message would have a stronger effect in reducing plastic consumption than a negative framed message. In addition, the mediation analysis showed that the message valence had a significant effect on shame despite the absence for a direct effect of the message valence on the intention to not purchase a plastic product. The moderated mediation showed no evidence that the need for social approval has a moderating effect on the relationship between the message valence and shame.","['consumer behaviour', 'plastic consumption', 'valence framing', 'need for social approval', 'shame']"

Assessing Executive Functioning and Intelligence in People with Psychotic Disorders,"Volkers, Jorn","['Van Aken, B.', 'Van der Hiele, K.', 'Klaassens, B.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction: Executive functioning [EF] and intelligence are likely to be impaired in people with psychotic disorders. There are two different ways of assessing executive functioning, performance-based or self-report measures. Even though both ways claim to measure the same construct, research in people with psychotic disorders shows that there is hardly any correlation between the two. Objective: Therefore, the goal of this study was to use an exploratory correlational design to investigate the association between performance-based and self-report measures in a more elaborate manner by using structural equation modelling [SEM], which may allow for a different view on the assessment of EF. Method: The study consisted of 236 psychotic patients, 65.6% were male. The mean age was 40.7 (SD = 12.1) and 41.1% of the sample were diagnosed with schizophrenia. All of the participants currently received treatment for either a first episode psychosis or a psychotic disorder. The performance-based measures in this study were the screener for intellectual and learning disabilities and tower of London, whereas the self-report measures consisted of the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult version indexes, metacognition index and behaviour regulation index. In order to see whether the different forms of testing do or do not show coherence with each other, structural equation modelling was used. Additionally, typologies were created to gain more insight into the prevalence of EF functioning of psychotic patients. These typologies were based on the used measures. Results: Results on the SEM showed that performance-based and self-report measures of EF do not show coherence (χ2(2) = 3.800, p = .150). The typologies revealed that psychotic individuals in this study scored more frequently within normal ranges rather than in clinically impaired ranges of the chosen measures. Conclusion: The typologies that were created in this study are novel within the field and provide an indication for future research. It is important to use both performance-based as well as self-report measures when assessing EF in order to get the full picture. Gaining more insight in EF might result in better mental healthcare which may allow patients to leave mental healthcare sooner.",
"Knowing me, knowing you: The influence of social anxiety traits on emotion recognition and the role of interoception.","Batelaan, Aimée","['Folz, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The ability to detect one’s own physiological state has been defined as interoception, and can vary greatly among individuals. In case of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), misattribution of internal cues has been commonly observed, often resulting in an overestimation of bodily arousal. Additionally, when experiencing social anxiety, individuals were found to process social information, such as emotional expressions, with a bias towards threat. The anxiety of possible negative evaluation within this mental health condition may elicit a persistent fear or avoidance of social situations. As research on interrelations between social anxiety, interoception and emotional processing appeared to be sparse, this online study aimed to explore possible relationships in a non-clinical population. Participants (N = 98) performed an emotion recognition task and filled out several self-report questionnaires including those addressing their subjective beliefs regarding interoceptive abilities (accuracy and attention) and trait levels of social anxiety. Unexpectedly, hypotheses regarding positive relationships between interoceptive abilities and social anxiety, as well as social anxiety and emotion intensity could not be confirmed. A significant relationship between social anxiety, interoceptive attention and emotion accuracy was also not observed. As previous research did suggest the presence of a relationship between the aforementioned variables, our study may not have been sensitive enough. For future research, it is advised to make use of a larger sample size, which overcomes limitations of the obligated conduct of online research. Ultimately, a better understanding of interrelations between social anxiety, emotion recognition and interoception can contribute to improve tailoring of interventions concerning individuals with SAD.","['social anxiety', 'emotion recognition', 'facial expressions', 'interoceptive attention', 'interoceptive accuracy']"

Executief functioneren en externaliserend probleemgedrag bij kinderen tussen de acht en twaalf jaar met een verhoogd risico op delinquentie,"Duijvenbode, Ellen van","['Oudega, M.', 'Rijn, S. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"In the Netherlands, 15% of boys and 10% of girls in elementary school show behaviour problems. The current study investigated executive functioning as a risk factor for externalizing behaviour problems. School-age children who are at risk of developing delinquent behaviour are compared to regular developing children in the relation between executive functioning and externalizing behaviour problems. Three components of executive functioning, inhibition, working memory and cognitive flexibility were investigated. The total sample consisted of 131 boys and 34 girls (N = 165), aged eight to twelve years old (M = 10). 76.4% of the sample were high-risk children; the other 33.6% consisted of the control group. The Teacher’s Report Form was filled in by teachers to measure behaviour problems. Three neurological tasks were used to measure inhibition problems, working memory and cognitive flexibility. To obtain the results, a multiple regression analysis, independent t-tests and a moderation analysis were conducted. Inhibition problems and cognitive flexibility appeared to be significant predictors for externalizing problems. Furthermore, high-risk children showed more inhibition problems and a less developed working memory and cognitive flexibility. There was no difference in the relation between any form of executive functioning and externalizing behaviour, when the high-risk and control group were compared. The proven relationship of inhibition problems and externalizing behaviour problems may ultimately be used for the implementation of interventions. Interventions could (partly) focus on improving inhibition control to decrease externalizing behaviour problems.",
Cognitive Decline in Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia and Its Underlying Neural Correlates,"Grandpierre, Leonie","['Rombouts, S.', 'Vos, F. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Introduction Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a young-onset neurodegenerative disorder with treatments still being in development. For trials testing such treatments, sensitive instruments to assess treatment effects are essential. This exploratory study aimed to identify such instruments by investigating gene-specific, presymptomatic cognitive decline and the underlying neural mechanisms of this decline. Methods We examined longitudinal cognitive decline using mixed effects models with natural cubic splines in six different domains for carriers of genetic mutations in GRN (n=46), MAPT (n=22), C9orf72 (n=29), and healthy controls (n=84). A voxel-based morphometry analysis was used to correlate cognitive decline to grey matter volume decline for the three mutation carrier groups. Results MAPT and C9orf72 mutation carriers showed a steeper decline on language (χ2(6) = 21.78, p = .001) and memory (χ2(6) = 18.42, p = .005) compared to GRN mutation carriers and controls. Decline in executive functions was associated with larger grey matter volume decline in the left superior and right middle frontal gyrus for C9orf72 mutation carriers and decline in language was associated with larger grey matter volume decline in the right anterior insula for MAPT mutation carriers. Discussion This study provides evidence of gene-specific cognitive decline in presymptomatic genetic mutation carriers of FTD. The findings highlight the importance of both neuropsychological and neuroimaging assessment which can be used as sensitive diagnostic biomarkers to identify and track disease progression in genetic FTD.","['Frontotemporal dementia', 'genetic disorders', 'cognition', 'grey matter volume', 'MRI']"

Involuntary vs voluntary anorexia-treatment: The effect of type treatment on BMI,"Rust, Anne","['Molendijk, M.', 'Van Furth, E.', 'De Rover, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction: Reluctance is an important factor in treating patients with severe anorexia. Sometimes the pursuit of weight-loss gets so out of control that somatic values drop to become life threatening. In that case, involuntary treatment can be imposed, raising the question whether a treatment with resistance can be effective. In this study, an involuntary treatment group was compared with a voluntary group in terms of growth in BMI. Additionally, this study examined the relation between personal characteristics and BMI over time. Method: 31 patients participated who were currently being treated in an inpatients program. Quantitative data such as BMI, age, resistance, feeding-tube administration and history of admissions was collected from both groups. The collected data was analyzed through a multi-regression analysis. Results: The groups differ in BMI growth; the voluntary patients gain more weight in the early stages of admission, however it is the involuntary group who takes the lead in a later phase. Furthermore, it has been found that the BMI growth curve of patients who receive nutrition from a feeding-tube rise faster compared to patients who eat naturally and involuntary patients experience more resistance to recovery. However, that does not mean that scoring high on resistance equals less effective recovery. Discussion: This study suggests that involuntary treatment may be effective when a situation has become dire. Although there are negative sides, such as disrespecting autonomy and damaging the client-therapist relationship, patients can often reflect the importance of treatment afterwards. Further long-term research needs to be done to determine whether any future relapses play a role in recovery.",
Group differentiations in adolescent stress and effectiveness of the school based intervention ‘Stress Lessons’: An empirical study among lower secondary school students in The Netherlands,"Couvée, Dion","['Vogelaar, S.', 'Bexken, A.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"School stress is increasing among secondary school students and students experience stress in different ways. However, information about which students are most affected by stress and need support is scattered. School-based interventions targeting stress are shown to reduce stress and increase knowledge about stress. However, knowledge gain was not specified for face-to-face interventions. This study aimed to clarify group differentiations (i.e., gender, age, and educational level) in stress levels, stressors, and effectiveness of the school-based intervention ‘Stress Lessons’ among lower secondary school students. The intervention was evaluated regarding its effect on general stress levels and knowledge about stress. This study had 1447 participating lower secondary school students (11-16 years) and followed a pre-test – intervention – post-test design. Classes were randomly assigned to a control or experimental group. During pre- and post-test, the Adolescent Stress Questionnaire-short and knowledge about stress questionnaire were administered. The intervention contained three psychoeducational courses, educating students about basic principles of stress, how they experience stress, and how to cope with stress. Results showed higher stress levels in girls than in boys and no general stress level differences between age groups and educational levels. However, personal stressors (e.g., peer pressure) were more stressful for practical / pre-vocational secondary students than for senior general secondary / pre-university students. In contrast, academic stressors were more stressful for senior general secondary / pre-university students than for practical / pre-vocational secondary students. Importantly, academic stressors were the most pressing source of stress in all educational levels. After the Stress Lessons, students reported increased general stress levels and increased knowledge about stress compared to before. Regarding knowledge gain, Stress Lessons were most beneficial for late adolescents and senior general secondary / pre-university students. Future research should focus on coping strategies used by lower secondary school students and their contribution to experienced stress levels.","['stress', 'stressor', 'lower secondary school students', 'gender', 'middle adolescents', 'late adolescents', 'educational level', 'school-based intervention about stress', 'psychoeducational course about stress']"
Taking a Moral High Ground: The Effects of Group-Based Moral Superiority on Solidarity Activists’ Collective Action Intentions and Activism Persistence,"Stieger, Xenia","['Pliskin, R.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Minority activists benefit from the support of those advantaged in a system of inequality to alter the status quo. However, previous research suggests that members of advantaged groups often engage in solidarity activism to bolster the moral image of their ingroup. We theorised that taking the moral high ground can be its own antecedent of collective action behaviour. In two studies, we investigated the role of group-based moral superiority in motivating collective action behaviour of solidarity activists in the Black Lives Matter movement. In Study 1 (n = 218) we examined the relationship between group-based moral superiority and both collective action intentions and activism persistence above and beyond traditional measures of collective action (i.e., SIMCA, Van Zomeren et al., 2008, 2012). In Study 2 (n = 209) we then manipulated group-based moral superiority experimentally to test whether higher levels of group-based moral superiority lead to increased collective action behaviour. Across both studies, we found support that group-based moral superiority plays an indirect role in increasing collective action intentions through stronger politicised group identification. The same indirect relationship was found for activism persistence in Study 1 but was not replicated in Study 2. We discuss implications of our findings for theory, future research directions, and practical aspects of collective action.",

Approach tendencies towards food and the effect of intranasal insulin on approach tendencies in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and healthy controls,"Veld, Michelle in 't","['Veldhuijzen, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus need to pay attention to healthy food because this could help to control blood glucose levels. With more insight into approach tendencies towards healthy and unhealthy food, it could be determined who is more or less sensitive to healthy or unhealthy food stimuli. Primarily, approach tendencies towards healthy and unhealthy food in patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy controls will be researched. It is hypothesized that the patient group has a higher approach bias towards unhealthy food compared to the healthy control group. Secondary, the effect of intranasal insulin on approach tendencies will be researched. It is hypothesized that insulin will affect approach tendencies towards food more in the patient group than in the healthy control group. Approach tendencies were measured with the mobile version of the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT). During the acquisition day, half of the participants received an insulin spray and half of the participants received a placebo spray. During the evocation day, all participants received the placebo spray. Differences between days indicate the effect of intranasal insulin. In total, 26 participants were included (20 type 2 diabetes patients and 6 healthy volunteers). There was a significant interaction effect between group and food F(1,21) = 8.199, p = 0.009, which means that the groups differed in their responses towards healthy and unhealthy food stimuli. The patient group had a nonsignificant higher approach bias towards unhealthy food and the healthy control group had a higher approach bias towards healthy food. There was no interaction effect between food, group, and day, which means that there was not found an effect of intranasal insulin. Further studies with bigger group sizes and a more heterogeneous group, through a better age and gender distribution, in a study specifically focused on the differences in approach tendencies towards healthy and unhealthy food between (intranasal) insulin and placebo are required. More insight could lead to better treatment with diet and psychological interventions where patients learn how to cope with a balance between healthy and unhealthy food distractions.",
"Understanding the Influence of Academic Demands and Resources, Perceptions of Inclusion and Minority Student Status on Student Well-Being: An analysis of the Job Demands-Resources Model in Higher Education","Paglia, Holly","['Doef, M. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present study investigated the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model in higher education and several exploratory hypotheses using a sample of 65 students from Leiden University. The JD-R proposes (a) academic demands (role conflict, pace & amount of work, and mental workload) influence exhaustion and declining performance, (b) academic resources (autonomy, role clarity, feedback, relationship with peers and supervisors) influence engagement and academic performance success and (c) academic resources buffer the effect of academic demands on exhaustion. Exploratory hypotheses included an investigation of students’ perceived inclusivity as an academic resource in higher education – predicted to influence engagement and moderate the effects of demands on exhaustion. It moreover explored differences in the student experience using the JD-R model - predicting minority students to experience a higher degree of academic demands than majority students, and minority students with high perceived inclusivity to have higher engagement than minority students with low perceived inclusivity. Data collection was accomplished via questionnaires distributed at two points in time. At time1 – participants responded to measures related to all variables under study, with the exception of academic performance. Academic performance was assessed via questionnaire at time2, at Time2. Multiple and moderated linear regression was used to examine the JD-R model hypotheses and perceived inclusivity in the JD-R model framework, and independent sample t-tests the differences in student experiences. Findings revealed partial support of the JD-R hypotheses. Pace and amount of work predicted exhaustion, but the other demands did not. Role clarity was similarly the only resource to predict engagement. No support was found for a buffering effect of academic resources on the demands-exhaustion relationship. Contrarily, role clarity increased the effect of role conflict on exhaustion. Performance hypotheses were not investigated due to insufficient sample size. As predicted, perceived inclusivity influenced academic engagement. However, perceived inclusivity did not buffer demands effect on exhaustion as expected. Student experience hypotheses revealed no differences in the degree of demands between minority and majority students but did demonstrate minority students with high perceptions of inclusivity to be more engaged than those with low perceptions of inclusivity. The findings highlight the importance of future research on predictors of student well-being and the differences in student experiences. They provide educators, researchers and policy makers some insight into relevant factors in the success of all students – both minority and majority.","['job demands-resources model', 'academic demands', 'academic resources', 'academic engagement', 'academic exhaustion', 'performance', 'academic achievement gap', 'perceived inclusivity', 'minority students', 'majority students']"

A study into the bidirectional ef ect of the brain and heart.","Dijken, Lida van","['De Rover, M.', 'Wever, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Depression and Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are both in the top leading causes of death, disability and productivity loss in the world and this is only projected to get worse. As the urgence of prevention is clear, research shows this could possibly be done simultaneously as there is a bidirectional effect between the two. One of the most recent explanations is that of an overactive HPA-axis and its hypersecretion of the hormone cortisol. One way of over-activating the HPA-axis is by ruminating, a common symptom of depression. Objective: This study explores the possibility of identifying the risk of developing depression and CVD early on using Pulse Transit Time (PTT) measurements and the LEIDS-RR. Methods: The participants, 34 women between 18-35 years old, were asked to fill out three questionnaires about depression and describe a negative situation that had happened to them. Weeks later their heart rates were measured in an fMRI where they were asked to ruminate about those negative situations. PTT was conducted using the ECG data. Results: No correlation between the LEIDS-RR scores and PTT during baseline or rumination was found. PTT scores did decrease significantly between baseline (M = 61.64687) and working memory task (M = 60.92451) (p = .048) though this was not in line with hypotheses. LEIDS-RR did not count as a moderator for this time effect. Discussion: A number of limitations may have affected the outcome of this study such as comorbidity, the circadian rhythm of cortisol, the low sample size, the duration of measurement or the vast variation in vehemence of described situations by the participants. Nevertheless, it is important to conduct further research into a possible early prevention of CVD and depression.",

In the current study, we tried to confirm the negative relationship between self-esteem and internalizing problems and to further investigate whether motherchild communication may serve as a moderator in this relationship during adolescence. In this cross-sectional study, 93 adolescents between 11 and 21 years old participated. They completed a self-report questionnaire measuring self-esteem and internalizing problems and participated in a communication interaction task with their mothers. The results from the present study confirmed that adolescents with high self-esteem experience fewer internalizing problems. Further, it was found that maternal warmth and emotional support in mother-child communication is also related to adolescents experiencing fewer internalizing problems. However, the current study did not find any support that mother-child communication is a moderator for the relationship between self-esteem and internalizing problems in adolescents. We can conclude that self-esteem and mother-child communication can serve as risk factors in adolescents’ developing internalizing problems, therefore it is important that extra attention is paid on these factors to enhance adolescents’ well-being.","['adolescence', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'self-esteem', 'mother-child communication']"

Statistical Learning Techniques for the Partial Automation of Article Screening in Meta Analyses Pertaining to Psychology,"Nosten, Tobias","['Dusseldorp, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The article screening process for meta-analyses is time-intensive and laborious. Statistical learning and natural language processing techniques can be used to partially automate this process. In this study, the performance of four models were compared using a range of evaluation metrics. The first model was built using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract the topics from the articles to be used as input for a random forest. The second model was built using LDA topics as input for an Extreme Gradient Boosted (XGBoost) tree. The third and fourth models added to the first two by also incorporating a bibliometric feature as input to the respective classifiers. To compare these models, the article catalogues from two meta-analyses pertaining to the field of psychology were gathered and processed. Thus, two real life data-sets were used for the analysis. All four models were built using the full body of text from the article as input for the LDA. These four models were pitted against a benchmark model which represented the more conventional approach to automated article screening. In both datasets, all four proposed models outperformed the benchmark model across all the performance metrics. In the first dataset, the model using LDA topics and bibliometric features as input to the XGBoost was the highest performing model. In the second dataset, the model using LDA topics and bibliometric features as input to the random forest was the highest performing model. The results of this study support the growing evidence that the partial automation of article screening for meta-analyses is indeed possible with a high level of efficiency.",

In a post-hoc simulation study, using the item scores on the School Attitude Questionnaire Internet (SAQI) of a large sample of Flemish students (N = 4211), the CCT methods were compared with respect to respondent burden, given minimized differences in proportion of correct classifications. Both CCT under IRT and CCT under SC showed the potential to reduce the respondent burden while maintaining 90% concordance with the full-length questionnaire. CCT under SC required fewer items (20% of the total item set) than CCT under IRT (37%), but in the process made larger misclassifications in terms of item ordering.",

Classification of frontotemporal dementia subtypes based on qualitative assessment of the verbal fluency test,"Dijkzeul, Annet","['Ruitenberg, M.', 'Hiele, K. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Aim: This study aimed to determine whether qualitative assessment of the verbal fluency test could help in differentiating between the behavioral subtype of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and the three primary progressive aphasia variants, semantic (svPPA), non-fluent (nfvPPA) and logopenic (lvPPA). We examined differences in clustering of words, switching between strategies, lexical frequency, age of acquisition, neighborhood density and word length. Method: Patients diagnosed with bvFTD (N = 51) or PPA (27 svPPA, 25 nfvPPA, and 34 lvPPA) and a control group (N = 25) performed a semantic and letter fluency task. Clustering and switching were assessed by two independent raters. Lexical frequency, age of acquisition, neighborhood density and word length were derived from existing databases. Between-group differences were examined and diagnostic performance was assessed. Lastly, associations with memory, language, processing speed and executive functioning were examined. Results: Patients with bvFTD produced more words on semantic fluency, more clusters and larger total cluster size compared to svPPA. svPPA patients produced words with higher lexical frequency and lower age of acquisition on letter fluency compared to all groups. nfvPPA patients produced fewer words on letter fluency compared to svPPA patients, but had larger cluster sizes. lvPPA patients produced shorter words with a higher neighborhood density on letter fluency compared to bvFTD patients. The qualitative measures were successful in discriminating bvFTD patients from PPA patients and svPPA patients from lvPPA patietns and nfvPPA patients. Distinction between nfvPPA patients and lvPPA patients was significant only after adding total number of words. Lexical frequency, age of acquisition, neighborhood density and word length were positively related to language and semantic fluency. Conclusion: The differences found on the qualitative variables are in line with what is known about the type of impairments in each subtype of FTD. Our findings show the wealth of information that can be obtained from the verbal fluency test and its usefulness in discriminating between subtypes of FTD. Qualitative variables alone are insufficient in discriminating between lvPPA and nfvPPA, however together with the quantative measures differentiation is possible. This highlights the usefulness of extensive analysis of the verbal fluency test.",
The relationship of beta blocker treatment with sleep disturbances and working memory among children with infantile hemangiomas,"Lavi, Barry","['Van Houdt, C.', 'Habers, E.', 'Rietman, A.', 'Hermans, A.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Beta blocker administration is one of the most common treatment methods for the vascular tumours infantile haemangiomas (IHs). Previous research has attributed possible side-effects to beta blockers, which include sleep disturbances and memory decline. Furthermore, research has found a link between sleep disturbances and memory decline. Thus, the present study aimed to test for possible long-term side-effects of beta blockers atenolol and propranolol. The study focused on children between ages 7-11 with IHs who were treated with beta blockers within their first year of life. The relationship between sleep disturbances and working memory among these children was analyzed. Furthermore, the differences between the study sample and population norms were analyzed regarding sleep disturbances and working memory performance. Lastly, differences between atenolol and propranolol on these measures were explored. The main findings showed a significant correlation between a high likelihood of sleep disturbances and a low working memory performance. In addition, the beta blocker sample showed a higher likelihood of sleep disturbances when compared to population norms. However, no lower working memory performance was detected in this comparison. Furthermore, no significant differences were found between propranolol and atenolol on neither sleep disturbances nor working memory performance. The main conclusion of this study points towards the possible negative relationship of beta blocker treatment with long-term sleep disturbances, which have a negative correlation with working memory performance.

To what extent does the existence of an electoral process change the motivation of protestors and Why?,"Hussein, Faris","['Tsagkroni, V.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Did the Ethiopian general election of 2020 play a role in stopping a three-year violent protest? Why? This research using data from interviews shows that many protestors in the regional state of Oromia believe the general election played a role, be it to a different level in a different group of people, in their decision to stop protesting. They mention the reform implemented by the new administration, the need to give time to the new administration, and influential individuals joining the mainstream political parties as reasons to prioritize the electoral process, away from protesting, so that they would vote for their candidate in the coming election. The research explains the findings using Horowitz’s (1985, 2010, 2014) expressive theory together with exchange theory (Robert 1969, Nownes and Neely 1996). Horowitz theorizes that mobilization creates ethnic political parties and these parties attract the mobilized who believe their interest is best served by their ethnic political parties. Expressive theory (Robert 1969, Nownes and Neely 1996) explains how much influential individuals or political entrepreneurs matter in mobilization and demobilization.",

The Role of Attachment and Gender in the Relation Between Maternal Love Withdrawal and Self Esteem,"Drunen, Anne-Fleur van","['Cruijsen, R. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Self-esteem is a fundamental change that occurs during adolescence, and previous studies suggested that maternal love withdrawal, parental and peer attachment quality contribute to adolescents’ self-esteem. Since lower levels of self-esteem are related to poor health outcomes, it is important to find out which factors contribute to these negative outcomes and which group of adolescents are especially at risk. Therefore, the present study investigated whether gender and attachment quality moderate the relationship between maternal love withdrawal and self-esteem. It was expected that there is a negative relationship between maternal love withdrawal and self-esteem in adolescents and that there are gender differences in this relationship. Moreover, it was hypothesized that there is a relationship between attachment quality and self-esteem, and that the relationship between maternal love withdrawal and self-esteem is stronger in adolescents who are more securely attached to their mother, father and/or friend than adolescents who are less securely attached. Participants were 160 adolescents aged 11-21 years who completed online questionnaires about maternal love withdrawal, attachment quality and self-esteem. The results showed that maternal love withdrawal, and maternal, paternal and friend attachment (anxious/avoidant) were negatively related to self-esteem. Furthermore, gender and attachment did not moderate the relationship between maternal love withdrawal and self-esteem. Interventions should be created that support insecurely attached adolescents or adolescents whose mother withdrew their love and educate parents about the negative consequences of using love withdrawal as a punishment for their child’s undesirable behavior.","['maternal love withdrawal', 'attachment quality', 'gender', 'self-esteem', 'adolescence']"
The relationship between empathic ability and empathic accuracy in parents,"Schepers, Emily","['Van Houtum, L.', 'Tona, K.D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In parent-adolescent interactions, conflicts are common, as focus points are usually different for parents and adolescents. Empathic accuracy, the ability to accurately infer the inner state of another human being, has been found important for successful communication during conflicts. Being empathic may help estimating others’ emotions. This study investigated the relationship between the level of empathic ability and empathic accuracy in parents and whether parental gender moderates this relationship. We expected that more empathic ability leads to a higher degree of empathic accuracy and that this effect was more pronounced in mothers as compared to fathers. To investigate this, 120 parents and their healthy adolescent performed a problemsolving interaction task while being videotaped and filled in a self-report questionnaire (Interpersonal Reactivity Index) about empathy. To investigate parents’ level of empathic accuracy, parents and adolescents performed a High Affective Moments task, in which they both rated the emotions of the adolescent during the videotaped interaction task. Parents’ and adolescents’ ratings were correlated to calculate an empathic accuracy score per parent. Linear regression analyses showed no significant result for the effect of empathic ability on empathic accuracy, neither for the effect of the empathic ability subscales (i.e., empathic concern and perspective taking) on empathic accuracy. Furthermore, these effects did not significantly differ between mothers and fathers. Results of this study contradict the literature. As this study only looked at five emotions to measure empathic accuracy, future research may use a wider variety of emotions. It would be useful to include clinical adolescents to generalize results to a wider population, to learn more about the potential differences in empathic accuracy in parents with a clinical adolescent and to contribute to the treatment and reduction of depressive symptoms.",
The relation between age and motor adaptation learning: A developmental and aging perspective,"Kracht, Esmay","['Schomaker, J.', 'Ruitenberg, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Sensorimotor adaptation is needed to adjust motor behaviour to the needs of different situations. A distinction can be made between early and late adaptation. Early adaptation means a fast improvement, where mainly cognitive processes are of importance. Fast adaptation is slower and more automatic. This master thesis study examined when the ability to adapt movements is developed in children and from which age declines start to occur in adults. While former studies looked into one side of the age range, this study took both the developmental and aging perspective into account. A sample of 463 participants between 8 and 73 years old took part in the experiment, conducted in the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam. The participants completed a motor task in which they had to use a joystick to move a cursor towards a target that was presented on a computer screen. In the baseline phase they received normal visual feedback. In the adaptation phase a 45 degree rotation was introduced, causing a different response when moving the joystick. The participants had to adapt their movements to this rotation in order to still be able to hit the targets. After the adaptation phases, the feedback returned back to normal. Participants needed to de-adapt in order to hit the targets again. The typical adaptation pattern was replicated, meaning that participants performed well in the baseline phase, had difficulty hitting the targets in the adaptation phase but improved after practicing. In the de-adaptation phase the participants again had some difficulty and also improved after some practice. In all phases an effect of age was found, meaning that young children and older adults both had more difficulty to successfully adapt. Children are able to adapt from their early teenage years. Declines in adults occur around their fourth decade of life. De-adaptation develops a bit later in children compared to adaptation. In adults declines in de-adaptation occur from the third decade of life. This knowledge can be used during treatment of motor problems, where treatments can be longer or more frequent for certain groups because they have more difficulty with adaptation.","['motor adaptation', 'age']"
The Effect of Novelty Exposure on Sensorimotor Adaptation Learning as a Function of Age in Healthy Subjects.,"Lasschuit, Nicole","['Ruitenberg, M.', 'Schomaker, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Novelty exposure has been found to elicit a positive impact on declarative learning. It is currently unknown whether this effect is also present in procedural learning. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of spatial novelty exposure and age on sensorimotor adaptation learning by using a mixed between-within subjects, cross-sectional design. A total of 463 healthy participants aged from 8 to 73 years (M = 23.8, SD = 16.5) were divided into 5 age groups: children (8-12), adolescents (13- 18), young adults (19-34), middle-aged adults (35-54), and older adults (≥ 55). Participants explored either a novel or familiar virtual environment before completing a manual adaptation task in which they were exposed to a perturbation in visuomotor feedback. Direction Error (DE), the angle between the optimal trajectory of the joystick and the actual trajectory at peak movement velocity was measured for each movement. A mixed factorial ANOVA was run on DEs and showed a significant difference between age groups F(4, 453) = 2.70, p = .030, ηp 2 = .03. A typical adaptation pattern was present F(7, 6.46) = 434.26, p < .001, η² = .49 and was found to be significantly different between age groups F(28, 3171) = 2.86, p < .001, η² = .03. The learning rate was determined by calculating the decay constant for the early adaptation, late adaptation, and de-adaptation phase of the sensorimotor adaptation task and was fit using an exponential decay function. A mixed factorial ANOVA was run on learning rate and showed a significant difference between all three phases F(1.56, 704.43) = 146.24, p < .001, ηp 2 = .24. Age groups differed in their learning rate per phase F(6.22, 704.43) = 12.00, p < .001, ηp 2 = .10. Novelty exposure did not significantly influence DE or learning rate, nor was age found to be an influencing factor on this. The results from this study did not find that spatial novelty influences sensorimotor adaptation. In conjunction with previous research results, this implies that novelty exposure does not elicit the same positive effect on procedural learning as it has been found to have on declarative learning.",

However, very little research has examined the effects of SES on distinct self-concept domains and the possible mediators of this relation in middle childhood. The goal of the current study was to examine the association between SES and academic and social self-concept, and the mediating role of parental sensitivity in this relation in middle childhood. This study utilized data from a large longitudinal twin study. The sample included 139 children aged 7-8 and their primary parent. Parental sensitivity was assessed during an 8-min structured play task between parent and child. In addition, the child performed a self-concept task and parents reported on their income. Two mediation analyses were carried out. Results indicated that SES had a significant positive direct effect on academic and social self-concept. The relation between parental sensitivity and academic and social self-concept was marginally significant. However, parental sensitivity did not mediate the relationship between SES and ASC nor SSC. These findings highlight the importance of considering family characteristics in the study of self-concept, and emphasize the need of further research to uncover mediators in the relation between SES and self-concept development.",

Within the current study, a computerized and groupadministered dynamic test was used to investigate children’s learning potential for analogical reasoning. The potential influence of test anxiety on their performance was also investigated. Participants included 48 seven- and eight-year-old children within specialized classes for giftedness and talent. The study employed a pretest-training-posttest design with a graduated prompts method for feedback and hints. Half of the children received training in between pretest and post-test, and the other half did not. Results revealed that trained children improved more than untrained children in their accuracy scores. Furthermore, it was found that test anxiety negatively influenced children’s accuracy scores at pre- and post-test. Test anxiety levels also predicted both pre-test accuracy and IQ scores. In the end, it was concluded that group-administered dynamic testing has the potential to efficiently provide both teachers and practitioners with a more accurate measure of children’s learning potential.",

Nevertheless, adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have limited peer interactions. Direct self-concept refers to how individuals perceive themselves, whereas reflected self-concept refers to our understanding of how others perceive us. Self-concept is also a multidimensional construct. From middle childhood onwards, individuals begin to have domain-specific self-evaluations, such as academic, physical and prosocial. Ιn the present study, 37 typically developing (TD) adolescents and 40 male adolescents with ASD evaluated their traits in these three domains from a direct perspective and the reflected perspective of their peers. Participants were aged between 12 and 17 years old and estimated IQ ranged from 80 to 135. The current study aimed to compare the self-concept between TD male adolescents and male adolescents with ASD, by testing their reaction times (RTs) to the direct and reflected self-tasks and also their direct and reflected overall self-concept positivity and positivity across the academic, physical and prosocial domain. The results demonstrated no significant differences between the two groups in neither their RTs to the direct and reflected self-tasks nor their domain-specific self-concept positivity. Both groups responded slower to the reflected self-tasks and scored lower in the academic self-concept positivity. With respect to the overall self-concept positivity differences were found in the TD group. The participants reported less overall selfconcept positivity for the reflected self-tasks.",

Teachers are expected to report more externalizing problem behavior compared to parents. In addition, it is expected that more externalizing problem behavior will be reported in boys than in girls and that the externalizing behavior decreases as the children get older. 178 participants with an average age of 11 years took part in this study, consisting of 138 boys and 40 girls. Externalizing problem behavior reported by the parents was measured with the Child Behavior Checklist / 6-18 (CBCL) and externalizing problem behavior reported by the teachers was measured with the Teacher's Report Form / 6-18 (TRF). A significant difference was found in reporting externalizing problem behavior between parents and teachers; t (177) = 19.48, p ≤ .001, where teachers reported more externalizing problem behavior. In addition, significantly more externalizing problem behavior was reported in boys than girls (F (1,174) = 6,444, p = 0.012) and no significant difference was found for age (F (1,174) =. 002, p = .966).

Additionally, the role of mindfulness is looked at. Academic resources (autonomy, role clarity, feedback, relationship with supervisors and relationship with fellow students) and academic demands (role conflict, pace and amount of work and mental workload), student engagement, exhaustion and mindfulness were assessed, as well as performance with a time lag. The study follows a nonexperimental and cross-sectional design with a longitudinal element. Sixty-four students completed a first online questionnaire, 16 a second. Scales from the following questionnaires were utilized: Questionnaire on the Experience and Evaluation of Work (QEEW), Utrecht Work Engagement Scale – student version (UWES-SS), Burn-out Assessment Tool (BAT), Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS-Short). Performance was operationalised as the number of ECTS-points obtained. Correlations, linear and multiple regression analyses, F-tests (ANOVA) and t-tests for coefficients were conducted with a significance level of p<.05 and a confidence interval of 95%. Role clarity predicted engagement (ß = .347, p = .013, Adjusted R2 = .215), pace and amount of work exhaustion (ß = .364, p = .003, Adjusted R2 = .119) (H1). Both role clarity (ß = .489, p = .001, Adjusted R2 = .201) (H2) and mindfulness (ß = .333, p = .005, Adjusted R2 = .335) (H5) moderated the effect of pace and amount of work on exhaustion. More mindfulness was related to higher role clarity (ß = .25, p = .034, Adjusted R2 = .047), feedback (ß = .371, p = .002, Adjusted R2 = .124), and relationship with supervisors (ß = .318, p = .018, Adjusted R2 = .087) (H3). Mindfulness positively related to engagement (ß = .315, p = .011, Adjusted R2 = .085) and negatively to exhaustion (ß = -.283, p = .024, Adjusted R2 = .065) (H4). Due to low participation rates, only correlations with performance were calculated. Relationship with fellow students correlated with performance (r(15) = .567, p = .027) (H6). The present study shows that the JD-R model is applicable to the university context. Mindfulness has direct and indirect beneficial effects on motivation and well-being of students. In order to promote study engagement and reduce exhaustion, universities should enhance role clarity and mindfulness of students, while seeking to lower pace and amount of work.","['Students', 'Exhaustion', 'Engagement', 'Mindfulness', 'Job Demands-Resource Model']"

Methods Patients with NDD-CKD (N = 460, Mage = 59, SD = 13) filled in the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire, the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-enhancing physical activity, and BMI data. Perceived adherence to a healthy diet was measured by factoring two questions in principal component analysis and the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire was used. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses and ordinal logistic regression analyses were conducted. Adjustments were made for age, gender and covariates that correlated with health behaviors. Results Patients with symptoms of depression were less likely to be physically active (β = -.11, p = .031), perceived adherence to a healthy diet was lower (β = -.16, p = .001), and more likely to be medication non-adherent (OR = 1.08, p = .003). The relationship between symptoms of depression and BMI only showed a trend towards significance (β = .09, p = .063). Patients with symptoms of anxiety only perceived to adhere less to a healthy diet (β = -.11, p = .019). Discussion The results implicate that patients with symptoms of depression engage less in health behaviors, while patients with symptoms of anxiety only adhere less to a healthy diet.

Nocebo Effects and Generalization: A Study on The Moderating Role of Anxiety on Nocebo Response and Generalization,"Duifhuis, Dominique","['Weng, L.', 'Laarhoven, A. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Nocebo effects are harmful treatment effects of an inert agent elicited by the anticipation of negative effects. Limited amount of studies focused on nocebo effects on pain, suggesting nocebo effects can increase pain sensations. Importantly, a better understanding of nocebo effects in relation to pain is needed due to its clinical relevance. Few studies showed that established nocebo effects can generalize to different stimuli, yet it has not been investigated that nocebo effects can occur from one modality to another within the category of pain sensations. Besides, research suggests personality factors such as anxiety can play a role in these nocebo effects. This study investigates nocebo effects on heat pain, its generalization to different pain stimuli, and as an explorative objective, we investigate the possible moderating role of anxiety in these effects. At first, the STAI-S questionnaire was assessed to measure the levels of anxiety per individual. To induce negative expectations, two nocebo inducing mechanisms were used; first, a conditioning phase related to heat pain was used to acquire an association between the activation of a sham device (ENS) and increased pain stimulation, secondly, verbal suggestion was used by informing participants the ENS will increase pain sensations. Then, heat pain stimuli set at the same temperature were assessed with the supposed activation and deactivation of the ENS. Thereafter, pressure pain stimuli at the same pressure were administered with the supposed activation/deactivation of the ENS. The results showed that participants experienced more heat pain and pressure pain with the supposed activation of the ENS. This demonstrates significant nocebo effect for heat pain, and it shows nocebo effects significantly generalized to pressure pain stimuli. However, for the explorative outcome, the moderation analysis did not find indications that anxiety played a role in these effects. The current findings suggests the important role of negative expectations interfering with pain perception and altering the experience of different pain stimuli. We discuss the importance to understand the less researched nocebo phenomenon and its generalization to effectively reduce nocebo effects in a clinical setting. Also, the need to explore psychological factors in these nocebo effects is emphasized.","['nocebo effect', 'anxiety', 'generalization', 'pressure pain', 'heat pain']"

The Intergenerational Transmission of Anxiety: Attachment as a Moderator?,"Keijzers, Fabienne","['de Voogd, L.', 'van der Cruijsen, R.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The transmission of anxiety from parent to child, as well as the influence of attachment style on anxiety, have widely been studied in isolation. In an attempt to replicate, as well as integrate these findings into a preventative framework, the overarching aim of the current cross-sectional study was to investigate whether attachment moderates the intergenerational transmission of anxiety. The sample comprised 73 children of parents with an anxiety disorder (at-risk group), and 83 children of parents without an anxiety disorder (control group). Parent disorders included and were limited to social anxiety disorder (n = 25), panic disorder (n = 42), and a combination of panic and social anxiety disorder (n = 6). Attachment to peers was measured with the single-item self-report attachment questionnaire (AQ-C). Moreover, the child respondents, aged between 7 and 15 years (M = 10.2, SD = 1.6), completed a self-report measure of anxiety symptoms (SCARED-71). First, contrary to expectations, parent disorder did not predict child anxiety symptoms in a regression analysis. Secondly, as indicated by a non-significant interaction effect, attachment did not moderate the relationship between parent disorder and child anxiety symptoms. Lastly, in line with our hypothesis, insecure attachment was related to heightened total, social, and separation anxiety symptoms. Medium effect sizes were obtained (η² > .06). The attachment-anxiety link highlights the importance of promoting a secure attachment style with parents and peers. Ultimately, attachment-based interventions could mitigate anxiety symptoms. Nevertheless, future longitudinal studies, employing multi-informant anxiety reports, are needed to clarify and replicate the current findings.","['parent anxiety', 'child anxiety', 'intergenerational transmission', 'attachment style', 'AQ-C']"
CAN YOU PASS ME THE SALT? – HOW DO DUTCH ADOLESCENTS PERCEIVE THE DAILY COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR PARENTS,"Laan, Lisa van der","['Janssen, L.', 'Ly, V.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"A healthy parent-adolescent relationship, including respectful communication, is crucial to an adolescent’s well-being. However, these findings have been based mainly on observations or self-report questionnaires and little is known about how adolescents perceive the communication with their parents in daily life. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore how Dutch adolescents perceive certain aspects of daily communication with their parents and whether there is an association between the perceived positivity of this communication and adolescents’ positive and negative affect during the day. Data was collected using an experience sampling method from 80 healthy Dutch adolescents (51 girls, 29 boys) with a mean age of 15.9. Descriptive statistics revealed that in general adolescents talked more frequently to their mothers than to their fathers, with the primary form of communication being face-to-face. Adolescents perceived their parents as actively listening and understanding, and they, in turn, saw their parents as less dominant and critical. However, differences were found in the adolescents’ perceptions of the parenting behaviour demonstrated by their fathers and mothers. Mothers were perceived as better at listening and understanding, whereas fathers were viewed as more dominant and critical. Lastly, results of a multilevel regression analysis indicated that the more the parent-adolescent relationship was perceived as positive, the more positive and the less negative adolescents’ affect was during the day. This study provides the groundwork for understanding how adolescents perceive the communication with their parents in daily life and the influence this has on their daily affect.",
The role of empathy in prosocial learning,"Aikman, Lisa","['Bruijn, E. de', 'Aktar, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Mechanisms underlying prosocial behavior, behavior or actions carried out with the intention to benefit another individual, are unclear. Previous studies have found a positive relationship between empathy and prosocial learning. The current study, inspired by the study of Lockwood and colleagues (2016), consists of two experiments where the link between prosocial learning, learning to obtain rewards for others, and empathy is investigated through a probabilistic learning task based on reinforcement learning principles. Participants had to choose between two different symbols and learn which of these had the highest probability of earning points in three different conditions: for themselves (selfish), for another person (other) or for no one (none). The first experiment measured the conditions with two probabilities (60/40, 70/30), whereas in the second experiment one probability was used (75/25). The aim of the current study was to replicate the findings of Lockwood and colleagues (2016) who found a positive relationship between empathy and prosocial learning with the same probabilities as our second experiment. The results from both experiments revealed no significant relationship between empathy and prosocial learning. The second experiment showed that participants learned better in the selfish condition compared to the prosocial and none condition. It can be concluded that in the current study no link was found between empathy and prosocial learning, which might be explained from the differences in research design between the study of Lockwood and colleagues (2016) and the current study. There seemed to be a self-bias in learning, i.e., people learn better for themselves than for others.","['Prosocial behavior', 'prosocial learning', 'empathy', 'learning task', 'reinforcement learning theory']"

Additionally we looked at the mediating effect of empathy in this relationship. One participant and one confederate had a conversation about six statements on a vegan lifestyle. The confederate used one of three different listening styles namely, active listening, neutral listening or argumentative listening, to interact with the participant who was arguing his or her point of view. The results showed that active and argumentative listening had a positive effect on the quality of the relationship between the conversation partners. This positive effect was mediated by perceived empathy. These two reactive listening styles seem to reflect empathy, and this in turn makes the other like you more as a person and conversation partner. Neutral listening didn’t seem to be preferred when being listened to. If someone is telling you a story or argues their point of view, the speaking party will really appreciate it if you are consciously listening to them, and also show this in reactions and behaviour.",

The relation between spatial features and children’s playground activities,"Gomez, Zoë","['Tsou, Y.T.', 'Klaveren, L. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The structures on the playground have an effect on the type of play in which children engage. Making appropriate environmental arrangements on the school playground can have positive effects on expanding the play activities and social interactions of children with special needs. This study examined the relationship between spatial features and children’s playground activities, by specifically looking at singlestructured, multi-structured, and open areas on the school playground. The participants were 76 Dutch pupils attending a special school in The Netherlands. The System for Observing Outdoor Play (SOOP+) was used to examine activities in different areas of the playground, and GPS loggers were used to measure the physical activity levels per area. Data showed that children played in larger groups in multi structured areas and open areas, compared to single-structured areas. Children are more social in multi-structured areas, than in open areas and single-structured areas. Whereas in single structured areas, they engaged more solitarily in play as opposed to the other two areas. Furthermore, in open areas they played social games such as chasing and ballgames more frequently compared to the structured areas. In multistructured areas, children engaged mostly in low-intensity social play compared to the other areas, whereas in single structured areas children engaged more frequently in non-social play types. This study contributes to existing knowledge on how to further improve the playgrounds in mainstream schools to make them more accessible and inclusive for all children. Some implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research were discussed.","['spatial features', 'playground structures', 'playground activities', 'physical activity levels', 'children with special needs', 'quantitative']"

The effect of self-concept on aggression type in individuals who display high psychopathic trait factors,"Dijk, Lenore S. van","['Groep, I. van de', 'Bos, M.G.N.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Expressions of antisocial behaviour have a detrimental impact on society. Given the heterogeneity among offenders, however, treatment effects yield various levels of success in diminishing antisocial behaviour. Knowledge on the origin of the differences between offenders is thus crucial. Recent research found that positive self-concept was associated with less hostility. This suggests that self-concept might explain some of the heterogeneity between offenders. The main objective of the present study was to examine the effect of the valence of self-concept on aggression type in individuals who presented high psychopathic traits. First, the association between psychopathy and aggression type was explored. Second, the relation between psychopathic traits and self-concept and the moderating effect of selfconcept on psychopathic traits and aggression was examined. Additionally, the relation between psychopathic trait factors (interpersonal-affective factor, and behavioural-lifestyle factor) and aggression types (proactive, and reactive) was examined, followed by an analysis to examine if selfconcept would differently moderate this relation. In total, 67 participants were included for this crosssectional survey study, of which 33 had completed a fMRI self-concept task. The questionnaires that were analyzed were the Youth Psychopathic traits Inventory and the Reactive-Proactive Aggression Questionnaire. The results indicated that a significant effect was found between both the interpersonalaffective factor (p = .001) and the behavioural-lifestyle factor (p = .019) and proactive aggression, and the behavioural-lifestyle factor and reactive aggression (p = .008). Second, a significant positive association was found between the interpersonal-affective factor and self-concept (p = .002). The moderation analyses showed that self-concept did not influence the relation between psychopathic traits and aggression. Given the positive correlation between the interpersonal-affective factor and proactive aggression and the association between self-concept and the interpersonal-affective factor, it can be argued that the promotion of a positive self-concept might lower the interpersonal-affective factor of psychopathy and therefore may also be of influence on aggression. This suggestion, however, needs a stronger body of empirical evidence to support it, since the moderation analysis did not support this hypothesis. Knowledge on the interaction between these variables could provide information for the design of possible treatment interventions for individuals with high psychopathic traits.","['self-concept', 'psychopathy', 'interpersonal-affective factor', 'behavioural-lifestyle factor', 'proactive aggression', 'reactive aggression']"

Through a cluster randomized controlled trial, a classroom-based intervention, aimed to improve incremental beliefs, was implemented in first-year classes of secondary education. Use of a mobile neurofeedback device was incorporated in the intervention to create for students an experience of controllability. Long-term impact of the intervention was evaluated through multilevel models with students at level 1 and classes at level 2. The intervention (n = 222) improved students’ academic achievement one year post-intervention, compared to an active control condition (n = 217). No long-lasting intervention effect on students’ experience of school-related stress was found. Further, socioeconomic status as a student characteristic did not appear to moderate intervention effectiveness for long-term outcomes.",
Sharing is caring: Network ties as predictors of psychological safety in hospital teams,"Meer, Demi van der","['Groeneweg, J.', 'Band, G.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"When it comes to teamwork, it is vital to communicate well with one another, especially when the lives of patients are in your team’s hands. In order to communicate well, hospital workers must feel psychologically safe enough within their team to address questions, problems, and errors, and must feel free to make suggestions and give feedback. This study investigates, by the means of a survey on psychological safety and network ties, whether social network ties within and between teams can predict the psychological safety of hospital workers, as they work with colleagues outside of their team as well. Asking for advice from (different) team members and being friends with team members was hypothesised to indicate that the team psychological safety is adequate. Having difficulties with team members was expected to lower the perception of psychological safety. Over the course of three weeks, 70 hospital workers answered the survey via Mechanical Turk and the results from the linear regressions suggest that advice ties positively affect and difficulty ties negatively affect team psychological safety, but only when psychological safety scores were at the lower end of the scale. Team tenure did not moderate the effect that network ties have on psychological safety while larger team sizes may weaken this effect. Future tools for improving psychological safety in hospital teams can make use of the knowledge that advice ties and difficulty ties are possible ingredients of a low psychological safety team moving to a desired level of psychological safety.","['Psychological safety', 'network ties', 'hospital workers', 'communication', 'patient safety']"
Effects of caffeine on Cognitive Performance After a Stressor and their moderation through Electroencephalography Theta/Beta ratio and trait anxiety – a double blind study,"Di Vicenzo, Edoardo","['Putman, P.', 'Ly, V.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Depending on baseline catecholamine levels and executive cognitive function, caffeine may enhance or disturb such functions. Trait anxiety and stress are associated with increased catecholamine action and cognitive effects of caffeine as a function of these factors is largely unknown. Hypotheses: First, high trait performance anxiety increases state performance anxiety after a stressor. Second, caffeine leads to a higher increase in state performance anxiety, also moderated by trait anxiety. Third, caffeine leads to a worse WM performance, also depending on trait anxiety. Fourth, after the consumption of caffeine, high TBR will enhance WM, whereas low TBR will impair it. Methods: A continuous performance task (N-back) was used to assess WM and the interference by negative stimuli. A stress procedure was used to induce performance anxiety and electroencephalogram was used to calculate TBR. To assess trait anxiety and state performance anxiety, the Cognitive Test Anxiety Scale (CTAS) and the State Performance Anxiety Scale (SPAS) were used. Results: TBR moderated the effect of caffeine on WM. High TBR corresponded to an enhancement of WM, whereas caffeine may have overruled the effect of TBR on WM. CTAS moderated increases in SPAS after a stressor, but not when in interaction with caffeine manipulation. CTAS, in interaction with caffeine manipulation, did not influence WM. Conclusions: Our first and fourth hypotheses were confirmed, as the association between high CTAS and a higher increase in SPAS after a stressor, and the moderation role of TBR towards WM, alone and partially when in interaction with the caffeine manipulation, were confirmed. Our second and third hypotheses were rejected, as CTAS, in interaction with caffeine manipulation, did not influence WM or the increase in SPAS after a stressor.",

Burn-out in individuals with cysteine altering NOTCH3-mutations: prevalence and association with disease onset,"Donné, Ashyla","['Schomaker, J.', 'Klaassens, B.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background The current study was the first to investigate the association between burn-out and Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a rare hereditary microangiopathy caused by mutations in the NOTCH3-gene. Previous research investigating burn-out and related factors provided evidence for a possible association between burn-out and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), lacune count, disease severity, stroke incidence and level of education. The current study investigated whether burn-out is an early symptom of incipient CADASIL. Methods The study population consisted of 151 individuals aged 20 years and older, with cysteine altering NOTCH3-mutations. For the current study, an MRI-scan of the brain and neuropsychological assessment (attention, executive functioning and memory) were performed. Results A history of burn-out was found in 33 participants. History of burn-out was associated with both MCI (p = .025, OR [Odds Ratio] = 3.46) and disease severity (p < .010, OR = 2.854), but not with lacune count (p = .926, OR = 1.038), stroke (p = .823, OR = .897) or level of education (p = .725, OR = 1.163). Conclusion In this sample of persons with a NOTCH3-mutation, burn-out was associated with MCI, and with disease severity. Hypothetically, in persons with a NOTCH3-mutation, burnout could be a consequence of MCI, and thus an early symptom of CADASIL. The ability to recognise the clinical onset of CADASIL more timely could be helpful in the clinical setting, because this could allow for better guidance and education of the patient and their support system.",

Verwacht werd dat de relatie tussen president Trump en voorzitter Kim in het begin slecht zou zijn en gedurende de verschillende ontmoetingen en briefwisselingen zou verbeteren en dit vervolgens ook een positief effect zou hebben op de onderhandelingen tussen de Verenigde Staten en Noord-Korea. Er is na een kwalitatieve contentanalyse van zowel de persoonlijke ontmoetingen als een briefwisseling tussen de twee leiders gevonden dat de persoonlijke band tussen Trump en Kim daadwerkelijk invloed heeft gehad op een verbetering van de relaties tussen Noord-Korea en de Verenigde Staten. Hoewel dreiging van beide landen naar elkaar sterk is afgenomen zijn er echter niet veel concrete stappen gezet op het gebied van denuclearisatie. Ook verliep de tijdlijn anders dan gedacht.

We employ a logistic regression analysis of four rounds of cross-national Afrobarometer survey data within a single-case study of Zanzibar. By juxtaposing assessments of Zanzibar’s status as a democracy onto a critical analysis of its experience with electoral democracy, we attempt to glean associations between democracy and power-sharing. In light of observed regional divergences in assessments of democratic quality, we argue that the question of political inclusion is central to conceptions of democracy in Zanzibar. Furthermore, we urge subsequent scholarship to articulate conceptions of democracy which align with local experiences.","['conceptions of democracy', 'democratisation', 'hybrid regimes', 'elections', 'power-sharing']"

Socially anxious individuals (SAI) often have cognitive biases that influence how they perceive social feedback from others and can perpetuate the disorder. How SAI learn from social feedback is important, as this can determine their self-view. The goal of this study is to investigate the influence of a specific cognitive bias in attention in socially anxious individuals (SAI) on social feedback learning. This study was conducted using a modified social judgment paradigm, designed to expose participants to positive and negative social feedback from 4 fictitious peers, who vary in their percentage of positive feedback. Participants will learn which peer gives the most and least feedback throughout the task. This will be conducted and measured using Electroencephalography (EEG). The results showed that SAI tend to orient their attention towards unexpected social feedback, regardless of valence. As well as this, SAIs tend to learn less from unexpected negative social feedback compared to lower SAI. Even though SAI payed more attention to unexpected social feedback, we propose that there might be an avoidance coping mechanism which influences the SAI to learn less from the unexpected negative social feedback.","['Social Anxiety', 'Social Feedback Learning', 'Attentional Bias', 'Electroencephalography', 'N1', 'P2']"
Parenting Cognitions as a Mediator of the Intergenerational Transmission of Anxiety,"Rusch, Marjolein","['Voogd, L. de', 'Cruijsen, R. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction: Anxiety disorders are one of the most common mental disorders in children and adolescents, and existing literature shows that children of a parent with an anxiety disorder have a higher change of developing an anxiety disorder, than children of a parent without an anxiety disorder. This study tested whether children of parents with an anxiety disorder indeed experienced more anxiety than children of parents without an anxiety disorder. Moreover, this study examined whether self-rated parental competence mediates the relationship between an anxiety disorder in the parent and child anxiety levels. Method: This study included 68 children of parents with an anxiety disorder (panic disorder and/or social anxiety disorder) and 70 children of parents without an anxiety disorder. The children were between 7 and 15 years old. The presence or absence of an anxiety disorder in the parent was established via a semi-structured interview (MINI). Moreover, parents reported levels of self-rated parental competence (NOSI) and the children reported on their anxiety symptoms (SCARED). Results: Contrary to the expectations, results indicated that children of parents with an anxiety disorder do not experience higher levels of anxiety than children of parents without an anxiety disorder. However, in line with the hypotheses, results show that self-rated parental competence indeed mediates the relationship between parent and child anxiety. Discussion: More knowledge about the role of self-rated parental competence in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety provides an angle for a more targeted intervention in the transmission of anxiety from parent to child. Further research is needed to investigate the specificity of the mediating effect. A limitation of this study is that the direction of the effect of self-rated parental competence on child anxiety cannot be inferred, due to the cross-sectional design of the study.",

Attention is in the eye of the beholder: An investigation of the relationship between attentional lapses and pupil size,"Felea, Alexandra","['Nieuwenhuis, S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Attention plays a vital role in helping the brain adaptively disambiguate between relevant and irrelevant information in the environment. Lapses in attention can thus have important negative consequences, varying from small mishaps to life-threatening mistakes and as such it is important to study their mechanisms. Neural entrainment appears to play an important role in attention and researchers have long tried to explore the relationship between the two. Unfortunately, a majority of studies on the topic relies heavily on animal and clinical studies, often using invasive measurement techniques. What is more, some of the non-invasive methods used (such as eye-tracking), sometimes offer contradicting results and lack methodological consensus. The current work is part of a larger study looking at the relationship between attentional lapses and neural entrainment using a multimodal oddball task. Here, we focused solely on eye tracking and set out to investigate whether lapses in attention correspond to changes in tonic pupil size and whether measures of attentional lapses suffer from time-on-task effects. Participants performed an oddball dual-modality task in which they were presented with two simultaneous streams of stimuli (visual and auditory) and had to attend and respond to either visual or auditory targets. We found that the number of false alarms reduced significantly over time and that pupil size showed a decreasing (albeit not significant) trend, while the number of hits did not appear to decrease as time passed. These findings seem to be in partial consensus with previous research on the topic. We also found a significant difference in pupil size between the two attending modalities (attend visual and attend auditory), suggesting that visual and auditory stimuli may influence attention (or at the very least pupil diameter) differently.

The Securitization of Legislation on Foreign Terrorist Fighters in the Netherlands: The Influence of Discourse on Policy-Making,"Zutt, Megan","['Willigen, N. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this thesis, I examine how the securitization theory can explain the acceptance of bills that are expected to limit the threat of returning foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) by the Dutch parliament. These bills limit the freedom of movement and privacy of Dutch FTFs and make the prosecution of suspected FTFs easier. I conducted a critical discourse analysis on a single case study to have an in-depth look at the relation between discourse and social practices. By examining statements made by influential politicians in debates in the Second Chamber, and by focusing on robust discourse that uses a war-narrative, implies “othering”, and makes assumptions about the threat and incentives of FTFs, it can be concluded that the response to FTFs in the Netherlands has been securitized. By labeling FTFs as an existential threat to society, influential politicians create a sense of duty for parliamentarians to accept legislation that is expected to limit this threat to protect the citizens. Instead of taking into consideration the real threat Dutch FTFs pose, the acceptance of the bills has been based on a socially constructed threat perspective of FTFs, which can limit the effectiveness of the legislation and infringe upon human rights.",

Introduction behavior comparison in Pan,"Engel, Frederik","['Tan, J.', 'Riddell, C.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"When trying to understand certain human behaviors, answers could be found in our closest living genetic relatives: Pan. The bonobo (Pan paniscus) alongside the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) have the highest percentage of shared DNA to humans, but show differences to each other in certain behavioral aspects. Some of these assumptions miss quantitative data to support them. This study looks at the integration processes in captivity of the bonobo and chimpanzee by comparing them via statistical analyses. New data is obtained in cooperation with the Frankfurt and Leipzig zoo and supported with additional data from pre-existing Pan introduction literature. We expected bonobos to integrate faster than chimpanzees (H1) and multiple integration to be faster completed than single integration in bonobos (H2). The results were in line with the first hypothesis and support the idea of the current scientific view on behavioral differences between these two Pan species. The second hypothesis was rejected based on the results from this study. We discuss the results alongside limitations and future research.",

This study aims to reveal how national identity is understood (in the light of this controversy) by studying the integration exam. The research has analyzed practice books and exams through discourse analysis by focusing on markers of national identity found in the literature. The analysis presents two themes: historical events and equality of men and women qualified for further discussion. These themes revealed a discrepancy between the understanding of national identity in the exam, in comparison to broader society and academia. Furthermore, the understanding was not a collective understanding, but created top-down, even though the literature stresses the importance of group feelings. The results indicate that the integration exam’s use of national identity is not in line with society's views. Therefore, it does not represent the collective views on national identity present in society and discussed in academia.",

Elections & Corruption: A Correlation Analysis,"Davis, Trevor","['Tsagkroni, V.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Despite the theoretical aversion of good governing practices and democracy to corruption, empirical findings to this point have yielded oft-conflicting results, suggesting the need for a more nuanced understanding between the relationship of democracy and corruption outcomes. Moving beyond general indices of liberal democracy, some scholars have examined the role of elections in curtailing corruption. In particular, their explorations into this relationship have focused on the ways in which elections vary across countries. From this literature, three electoral qualities have been identified as the most significant in their association with corruption: political competition, political polarization, and campaign finance regulations. Though, these qualities have yet to be explored comparatively. This study addresses that gap by employing multiple regression models in a cross-country analysis to further assess the relationships between each of these electoral qualities and corruption outcomes. In sum, political competition, both de facto and de jure, shows positive correlations with clean governance. Political polarization shows inverse relationships to corruption outcomes, with polarization amongst elites positively correlated with clean governance and societal polarization negatively associated with clean governance. Lastly, transparency of campaign donations shows a positive, albeit minimal, correlation with clean governance, while publicly funded campaign finance programs are negatively associated with clean governance.",

The study is based on a case study approach, using qualitative text analysis as a method of analysis. The theoretical framework builds on theories of postcolonial feminism, primarily by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and Chandra Talpade Mohanty, intersectional theories and previous research examining the links between climate and gender in Bangladesh. The selected material, the SDGs and the BDP 2100 is analysed through four themes; ‘Discursive Marginalization’, ‘Consciousness and Subject’, ‘Intersecting Challenges’ and ‘Sustainability and GDP’. What are the trajectories for climate and gender justice in Bangladesh, in relation to the SDGs and the BDP 2100? This research finds that although gendered vulnerabilities linked to climate change are acknowledged, it lacks representation and agency from a postcolonial perspective. Moreover, it finds that BDP 2100 does not acknowledge gendered (or social) dimensions in how Bangladesh is impacted by climate change, which poses a problem for how to formulate sound and inclusive policies.","['climate', 'gender', 'justice', 'Bangladesh', 'BDP 2100', 'SDGs', 'intersectionality', 'postcolonialism', 'post-development']"

Previous research suggests that people growing up in poverty perform better on attentional shifting and visuospatial memory later in life. The current study continues on this and hypothesizes that early financial hardship will lead to better performance on shifting and visuospatial memory tasks under conditions of difficult monetary scenarios, compared to easy monetary scenarios. Results show marginally significant results indicating that people growing up in poverty are better at a combined visuospatial memory and attentional shifting task than people not growing up in poverty, but only when they were confronted with a difficult monetary scenario.

Conversely, their counterparts in the low financial difficulty situations would underperform due to the dissimilarity of the circumstances the cognitive abilities adapted to in childhood. Our results provided support for the hypothesis as participants who grew up poor performed better at switching and visuospatial memory in current financially difficult situations compared to their peers in the low difficulty situation. These findings indicate that difficult circumstances in childhood could improve cognitive abilities needed to persist in those circumstances.","['life history theory', 'task switching', 'childhood poverty', 'executive functions', 'visuospatial memory', 'cognitive adaptations']"

Is The Effect of Intranasal Insulin on Food Consumption Different For Women And Men?,"Schubert, Annika","['Veldhuijzen, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Adherence to lifestyle changes like a healthy diet in type 2 diabetes patients is low and can result in a low Quality of Life. Previous research has shown that intranasal insulin, as a new form of treatment, can have a side-effect of potentially decreasing hunger in food consumption in healthy men, but not in healthy women. The effect of intranasal insulin, and possible gender-specific responses, has not been investigated in diabetes type 2 patients yet. This is important as it might result in a decreased disease burden, risk of complications through increased treatment adherence to lifestyle changes. Research questions were: 1) Is the effect of intranasal insulin on food consumption different for women and men? and 2) Is the possible gender-effect of intranasal insulin on food consumption also found in diabetes type 2 patients and healthy subjects? It was hypothesized that men would eat less than women as a response to intranasal insulin in both the healthy participants as well as the type 2 diabetes patients. The study had a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. The 26 participants came to the lab on two consecutive days. On day one, half of them were given the intranasal insulin spray and half were given a placebo spray. On day two, all were administered the placebo spray. Afterwards, participants were presented with bowls of healthy snacks on both days. A 2x2x2 repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to analyse possible gender effects. 1) there was no main effect of gender (p= .302), nor significant difference in food consumption (p= .213). The interaction was non-significant (p= .552). 2) there was no main effect of gender (p = .645), no main effect of group (p = .982), and no significant difference in food consumption (p = .400). The interaction was non-significant (p = .693). No gender-effects in food consumption as a response to intranasal insulin could be found. Putting the study on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in unknown group membership and a small sample size. Future research may add a questionnaire measuring self-efficacy and intention to investigate behavioural tendencies on (un)healthy food consumption as they could moderate the effect of intranasal insulin.","['intranasal insulin', 'gender differences', 'food consumption', 'diabetes type 2']"
Why wonder “why”? The effectiveness of elaborative interrogation as a learning technique within an e learning course for commercial airline pilots,"Jansen, Robbie","['Band, G.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"E-learning programs are a popular tool to convey knowledge or to serve as preparation in a flipped classroom set-up, in schools as well as for in-company training. The responsibility these programs give to the learner increase the risk of course failure. To support the learner, simple learning techniques can be incorporated. Dunlosky et al. (2013) identified elaborative interrogation (EI) as a promising learning technique. The current study analysed the effectivity of elaborative interrogation for supporting the learning of commercial airline pilots in an e-learning preparation for a communication course. The objective was to broaden the generalizability of EI as a learning technique, analyse its effectivity outside the academic context and possibly enhancing the effectivity of the target course. This study compared EI to an active control group using a different, noted less effective learning technique: summarization (Dunlosky et al., 2013). Prior knowledge is known to be an important moderator for the effectivity of elaborative interrogation, which was also incorporated in the experiment. Two groups of participants due to take this course at the time of research completed the e-learning, either answering ‘why-questions’ (EI prompts) or ‘what-questions’ (summarization prompts) per block of theory. No significant differences were found on performance between both learning techniques. The moderation analysis of prior knowledge could not be executed due to violation of important assumptions. Limitations and recommendations for future research are provided.","['elobarative interrogation', 'prior knowledge', 'e-learning', 'flipped classroom', 'commercial aviation']"

Effect of Frailty on Quality of Life in Elderly Psychiatric Patients: A Longitudinal Study,"Harrison, Henry","['Berg, J. van den']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The aim of this study was to investigate quality of life (QoL) changes in elderly psychiatric patients with and without frailty. Forty-six Dutch patients (67.4% women and 32.6% male, mean age 74.9 years (SD 7.3)) who were treated by Parnassia, Den Haag, a psychiatric hospital, were investigated in this study. Frailty was defined by the Fried Criteria and QoL was measured using the EuroQol EQ5d 3L which investigates the domains of mobility, self-care, activity, anxiety/depression, and pain/discomfort. Frailty was present in 11 of the 46 patients. Frailty was associated with worse overall QoL than non-frailty, with a moderate effect size; U = 72.0, p = .002, r = .458. Frail patients had significantly lower scores in the self-care domain at baseline than non-frail patients; U = 98.0, p = .003, r = .435. For all other domains, no significant differences between frail and non-frail groups were found at baseline. Frail and non-frail patients saw significant improvement in QoL between baseline and 1-year follow-up measures t = 3.809, df = 10, p = .003 and Z = 2.22, p = .027, r = .375 respectively. Frail patients saw improvements in all domains except activity, while non-frail patients saw improvements only in the domain of anxiety/depression. We found that treatment of frail patients has a large benefit on the patients’ QoL, which was greater than for those without frailty. In those who are frail, activity is the domain which improves the least and therefore we suggest activity as the area where researchers may target their efforts in future research and treatment possibilities.",

In this study, frailty was defined by the Fried criteria. In addition, two screening instruments (GFI/TFI) and two frailty components (handgrip strength and walking speed) were used to investigate differences between the four groups of patients with different psychiatric disorders. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study including 131 participants (81 inpatients and 50 outpatients) aged 65 years and older without dementia, who were registered at the old age psychiatry department of Parnassia Group in The Hague. Results: Based on the Fried-criteria, 29.8% of the total group in this study was frail. In this sample, no significant differences in the prevalence of frailty were found between groups of patients with different psychiatric disorders using the Fried-criteria. Also, there were no significant differences between the mean scores at the frailty components handgrip strength and/or walking speed between groups of patients with different psychiatric disorders. In contrast, significant differences in the mean scores on the GFI and the TFI between groups of patients with different psychiatric disorders were found. Conclusion: The prevalence of frailty is relatively high in elderly patients with psychiatric disorders. In this study, we only found significant differences between groups of patients with different psychiatric disorders using screening instrument for frailty. Since this is one of the first studies to analyze these differences additional research is therefore recommended.",

Individual Differences in Prosocial Behavior: The Role of Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms,"Falke, Theresa","['Bruijn, E. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"How we behave in social contexts influences essential life aspects such as quality of relationships and well-being. Here, actions may have positive or negative consequences for others. Notably, patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) display inflated responsibility attitudes and often fear negatively affecting others. This study investigated whether participants high in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) display enhanced learning to benefit others in a prosocial learning task. Healthy individuals of two samples (N = 95; N = 86) performed the task in three responsibility contexts. Participants in the first study learned to obtain rewards for 1) no one, 2) an anonymous other, or 3) themselves. Participants in the second study learned to obtain rewards for a friend instead of no one. Groups of low and high scorers were created based on the participants’ scores on the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R). The results did not reveal support for a relationship between OCS and prosocial behavior. Further, high OCS learned similarly to obtain rewards in anonymous and public prosocial contexts. Additionally, in both studies, participants learned best to obtain rewards for themselves. Results suggest that responsibility contexts do not modulate high OCS participants’ learning. This unexpected pattern may be explained by the absence of negative consequences for others. The present study also suggests that individuals, in general, may show enhanced motivation for effort when they can obtain a reward for themselves. Future research should investigate whether individuals who score low and high on OCS exhibit differences in obtaining rewards and preventing punishment.","['prosocial behavior', 'responsibility', 'obsessive-compulsive disorder', 'OCD', 'obsessive-compulsive symptoms', 'OCS']"

As a significant amount of patients does not seem to adhere sufficiently to these self-management behaviors, the study objective was to examine psychological factors that are associated with adherence to these self-management behaviors. In this study, the univariate, direct associations between perceived control, anxiety and adherence to a healthy diet or engagement in physical activity were investigated. Specifically, this study tested whether the relationship between perceived control and the self-management behaviors was mediated by symptoms of anxiety. A cross-sectional design was used to investigate the relationships between perceived control, anxiety and the self-management behaviors. An online survey consisting of self-report measures was administered on 145 patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD that received treatment in Dutch hospitals. The Brief IPQ, GAD-7, SQUASH and questions based on nephrology guidelines were used to measure perceived control, anxiety, physical activity and adherence to a healthy diet, respectively. Cognitions of helplessness, measured with the ICQ, were used as an additional expression of low perceived control. The direct relationships were tested with a number of bivariate regression analyses and bootstrapping was used to test the mediation effect. Findings show that perceived control was directly and positively related to physical activity (b* = .18, p = .045). Cognitions of helplessness were found to be directly and positively associated with anxiety (b* = .21, p = .01). Patients did not seem to engage less in the self-management behaviors when they experienced lower levels of perceived control or more cognitions of helplessness, as a consequence of having more symptoms of anxiety. Findings suggest that patients with higher levels of perceived control, might engage in more physical activity and that patients with more cognitions of helplessness might experience increased anxiety. An important implication of these findings is that is seems necessary to design cognitive behavioral interventions that aim to enhance levels of perceived control in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD. Theoretical and practical implications, limitations of this study and suggestions for future research are discussed.","['non-dialysis dependent CKD', 'perceived control', 'cognitions of helplessness', 'physical activity', 'adherence to a healthy diet']"

Both depression and anxiety increase the risk of experiencing suicidal ideation. However, the specific relations between symptoms of depression and anxiety on the one hand, and suicidal ideation on the other, remain unexplored. Therefore, we investigated these relations both at the cross-sectional (N = 2981) and the temporal level (N = 2596), with a follow-up time of 2 years. We included data from the NESDA study and controlled for the covariates age and gender. To do so, we used unregularized network models, each consisting of 21 nodes. In each network, 10 nodes represented depression items, 10 nodes represented anxiety items, and one node represented suicidal ideation. Results showed that the relation between suicidal ideation and depression was stronger than the relation between suicidal ideation and anxiety. This held true at the cross-sectional and temporal level. Overall, depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline explained about 15% of suicidal ideation at the cross-sectional level, and up to 13% at the temporal level. However, these percentages are not directly comparable, because only for the temporal analyses did we control for previous suicidal ideation. Results should be replicated and further investigated in order to be able to draw firm conclusions.","['suicidal ideation', 'major depressive disorder', 'generalized anxiety disorder', 'network analysis']"

Furthermore, while various personality factors have been associated with susceptibility to the nocebo effect, little is known about a potential interplay between them. In the current study, we investigated in healthy participants whether nocebo effects on pressure pain can be induced, via open-label conditioning, and reduced via counterconditioning and whether counterconditioning is more effective than extinction. All procedures were combined with open-label verbal suggestions. Additionally, we investigated the roles of body vigilance, catastrophizing, and pessimistic tendencies in the induction and reduction of the nocebo effect. We found that conditioning could effectively induce a nocebo effect on pressure pain. Moreover, both counterconditioning and extinction were able to reduce the nocebo effect but counterconditioning was more effective. In addition, we did not find a significant relationship between the personality factors and the nocebo effect and its reduction. These findings indicate that counterconditioning with verbal suggestion is a promising strategy for reducing nocebo effects. Future research should investigate the generalizability of this method to a clinical population and should further examine the role of personality factors in nocebo effects.",
"The Inclusion of Former Rebel Groups in Post-Conflict Electoral Politics: The Guarantee for Durable Peace: A comparative case study of Rwanda, Liberia, Angola, and Mozambique","Eijk, Charlotte van","['Masullo, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to uncover the conditions under which the involvement of former rebel groups in post-conflict politics contributes to enduring peace. Many of today’s peace settlements are built around the promises of post-conflict electoral politics and the involvement of former rebel groups in this process. Yet, the electoral process entails high levels of uncertainty for combatants, which makes credible commitment to electoral politics rather difficult. Therefore, conflict scholars have tried to identify ways by which the problems of commitment can be resolved. Nevertheless, there is a lack of consistency within the literature on what specific conditions determine whether the involvement of former combatants in post-conflict electoral politics contributes to durable peace. This study aims to fill this gap by examining how the interaction of the three main conditions: third-party assistance, levels of institutionalization, and power-sharing institutions, affects the relation between the participation of former combatants in post-conflict politics and durable peace. I combine within-case process-tracing with a case comparison of Rwanda, Liberia, Angola, and Mozambique.",
Violent protest in Latin America and popular support for the military,"Heide, Susanne van der","['Masullo, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study investigates the relationship between violent protest and popular support for the military in Latin America and Chile, Recently, Latin America has experienced a large wave of violent anti-government protests causing unrest and instability in the region. Simultaneously, a growing trend shows that Latin American citizens are becoming more supportive of the military. Accordingly, existing theories on militarization have not yet sufficiently analyzed the link between these two variables. While scholars often indicate that insecurity and distrust in political institutions are important determinants to growing levels of support for the military, they have not yet been linked directly to violent protest. Therefore, this research aims to build upon these works and theorizes that violent protest leads to feelings of insecurity and distrust in political institutions which in turn, drives citizens to grant more authority to the military. It is found in the Chilean case that violent protest generally does not lead to higher levels of support for the military although it does fuel demands for a short-term military solution to curb public disorder.",

This paper brings forward the following research question: What is the effect of ICT on the onset of armed conflict? The discussion will be operationalized by a cross-national country analysis on seven ASEAN countries between 2001 and 2017. These economies have seen an exponential spread of individual-access to ICT since they have become widely available to the masses, while also being continuously affected by severe on-going armed conflict. To answer the research question, the theoretical link between ICT and conflict onset is empirically examined by testing three hypothesis quantitively, using a negative binomial regression model. Based on the existing literature on conflict onset, I expected a positive relationship: an increase of ICT would be associated with an increase in armed conflict onset. The findings confirm most of the expectations, while others ask for more nuanced research on cell phone and Internet availability and the relationship with armed conflict onset.",

Het feit dat deze onderwerpen soms door dezelfde partijen weer van de parlementaire agenda worden geschrapt, wordt daarbij vaak genegeerd. Deze studie analyseert 319 succesvol aangevraagde dertigledendebatten uit de Tweede Kamer om te achterhalen welke factoren een rol spelen het schrappen van zaken van de parlementaire agenda. Uit een nested analysis opgebouwd uit logistische regressies en een content analysis blijkt dat probleemeigenaarschap geen belangrijke factor is bij het intrekken van dertigledendebatten. De mate waarin een partij een populistische oppositiestijl hanteert, hangt daarentegen sterk samen met het intrekken van dertigledendebatten. Populistische partijen trekken minder dertigledendebatten in, omdat dertigledendebatten met name geschikt zijn om democratische controle uit te voeren. Omdat populistische partijen vooral gericht zijn op democratische controle, zijn zij daarom minder geneigd om een dertigledendebat in te trekken.",

This behavioral misalignment in domestic gardening is an example of the intention-behavior gap. Facilitating factors of this gap are poorly understood. This study aims to: 1. establish an intention-behavior gap in domestic green gardening, and 2. provide insight in impeding factors in the translation of green intention into gardening behavior. Two inertia-inducing factors were considered: goal conflict and procrastination. I tested whether intending to perform greening activities positively influences garden greening behavior when conflict between garden goals (H1) and procrastinating garden adjustments are low (H2). An online survey was distributed to garden-owners in Leiden (N=146). Multiple Response Analysis confirmed that intention mainly predicts greening behavior whilst leaving 63.6% of variance unexplained, showing a gap. Goal conflict and procrastination were not significant moderators. Strategies to increase garden greening are discussed and future research should continue studying intention-behavior gap moderators.","['inertia', 'intention-behavior gap', 'domestic gardens', 'garden greening behavior', 'climate mitigation']"

Robustness of Two Step Latent Class Analysis Under Violation of Underlying Assumptions,"Stephoudt, Bastian van","['Bakk, Z.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The current thesis investigated the robustness of the two-step latent class analysis approach including a distal outcome variable when compared to the robustness of the traditional one-step approach and the BCH approach. The robustness was tested in two simulation studies. The first study violated the assumption of a normally distributed distal outcome variable, while the second simulation study violated the assumption of equal variance. The used model included ten indicator variables and one distal outcome. Furthermore, the model included two latent classes. We measured the performance of the three approaches with the bias and coverage rates of the estimated parameters, as well as the RMSE and the SE of the parameters, divided by the SD of the parameter. The results showed that all the three approaches performed approximately equally well. There was no severe under- or over-coverage, with the lowest averaged coverage-rate being .93. A possible explanation for these positive results was that the model used was relatively easy to estimate. Future research should therefore focus on implementing more complex models, when trying to execute similar tests of robustness.",

I s distractive media multitasking related to altered online shopping behavio u rs?,"Frieske Romen, Els","['Weiden, A. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Simultaneously engaging in multiple media activities is becoming increasingly normal in this digital era. Since distraction and media multitasking are closely related, a new term was created by Aagaard (2014) to describe this activity: Distractive Media Multitasking (DMM). As more shopping is done online and e-commerce grows every year, DMM could have effects on the way consumers purchase online. This thesis uses an extensive questionnaire including an online shopping task to determine differences in shopping behaviors between differing levels of DMM. Firstly, it was expected that a higher amount of DMM activities would lead to a higher number of bought products and a lower purchase satisfaction. Secondly, it was expected that a higher experienced distraction due to DMM would lead to a higher number of bought products and a lower purchase satisfaction. No significant results were established. Exploratory research shows that engaging in DMM on multiple devices makes for a higher satisfaction level than engaging in DMM on only one device. Limitations of this study include the limited control of the research setting, while strengths include the examining of different aspects of DMM. Recommendations for future research contain changes to the research design and extensions to investigating additional DMM elements.",
The Effect of Metamemory on Memory Integration,"Kooy, Wessel","['Richter, F.R.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Memory integration is a process by which related experiences are stored as overlapping representations in distributed networks in the brain. Eventually, these networks form schemas, and such schemas allow for quick extraction of knowledge when faced with new information. External and internal factors influencing memory integration remain, for a large part, unclear. Here, we manipulated metamemory, which is the knowledge and cognition one has about one’s own memory, to assess if metamemory differences might drive memory integration and schema formation. Previous studies have suggested that words in large font sizes are subjectively experienced as easier to remember than words in small font sizes, but that no difference exists in terms of objective retrieval performance. Therefore, we systematically varied the location of small and large font size words from six categories with regards to a location schema, to induce this well-documented effect on metamemory. This approach allowed us to study the effect of differences in (subjective) metamemory on objective memory performance and memory integration. When participants were asked to predict where new words from each category would appear (a test of their integration performance), we expected participants to be biased to the location of large font size words. However, results showed that this was not the case. In contrast to many earlier studies regarding the font size effect, we did not observe an effect of font size on subjective metamemory, and instead observed that large words were objectively recreated more accurately than the locations of small words. The diverging effects observed in our study compared to previous research might be due to differences in the task used in the present study versus earlier studies regarding the font size effect.",

Gedragsproblemen in de kinderopvang; De rol van wel bevinden in de samenhang tussen de sensitiviteit van de pedagogisch medewerker en gedragsproblemen bij het kind.,"Hingh, Sharon de","['Vermeer, H.', 'Vet, S. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Er wordt in Nederland steeds meer gebruik gemaakt van kinderopvang. Door die toename fungeren pedagogisch medewerkers steeds vaker als medeopvoeders. Zij spelen een grote rol in de opvoeding en de ontwikkeling van kinderen en zij hebben mogelijk ook een rol in het wel of niet tot uiting komen van gedragsproblemen tijdens de kinderopvang. Daarom is in huidige onderzoek bekeken of de sensitiviteit van de pedagogisch medewerker samenhangt met gedragsproblemen van het kind tijdens de kinderopvang. De rol van welbevinden in deze samenhang werd op twee manieren getoetst, als mediator en als moderator. Verwacht werd dat er een samenhang zou worden gevonden tussen de sensitiviteit van de pedagogisch medewerker en gedragsproblemen bij het kind, waarbij meer sensitiviteit zou lei den tot minder gedragsproblemen. Welbevinden zou naar verwachting een verklarende variabele zijn in deze samenhang, een mediator. Ook werd verwacht dat het welbevinden van het kind een modererend effect zou hebben op de samenhang tussen de sensitiviteit va n de pedagogisch medewerker en gedragsproblemen van het kind, waarbij meer beleving van welbevinden de samenhang zou versterken en dus bij zou dragen aan minder gedragsproblemen.

Er blijkt geen samenhang tussen de sensitiviteit van de pedagogisch m edewerker en de gedragsproblemen van het kind tijdens de opvang. En de rol van welbevinden hierin kan niet worden bevestigd. Toekomstig onderzoek is nodig om de samenhang tussen sensitiviteit en gedragsproblemen tijdens de opvang verder te onderzoeken, ach terliggende verklaringen te toetsen en meer inzicht in de rol van welbevinden te verkrijgen.",
"Giving behavior to friends, strangers and non-liked peers and the role of empathy among gifted adolescents","Kuijt, Lisette","['Asscheman, S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Giftedness has both been theorized as having a positive effect on giving behavior, due to more advanced moral- and prosocial reasoning, as well as having a negative effect, due to more reported social – and emotional problems (e.g. anxiety, worry, sensitivity) (Zeidner, Shani-Zinovich, Matthews, and Roberts, 2005). Given the role of giving behavior in reciprocal interactions with peers, research about giving behavior in gifted adolescents will give more insight on the emotional and social well-being of these youth. This study examined giving behavior to friends, non-liked peers and strangers in gifted and non-gifted adolescents between nine and twelve years old (Mage = 10.88), and the mediating role of empathy in the relationship between the type of education (gifted or regular) and giving behavior to the respective targets. Giving behavior toward the different targets was measured using the prosocial donation task in which participants divided coins between themselves and, respectively, a friend, a non-liked peer and a stranger. The results showed no significant difference between the giving behavior to the respective targets of gifted adolescents and their peers. In addition, empathy was not found to be a mediator in the relationship between giftedness and the giving behavior to the respective targets. These findings suggests that giftedness is not related to prosocial giving behavior toward different targets as measured in this prosocial donating task and that empathy does not explain the suggested higher prosocial giving behavior in gifted adolescents.",

Beide partijen zijn rechts-populistisch, iets wat niet vaak voorkomt in Europese parlementen. Bijna al deze partijen zijn gecategoriseerd als radicaal rechts-populistisch of neoliberaal populistisch. De PVV van Wilders is gecategoriseerd als radicaal rechts-populistisch, maar voor het FvD ontbreekt een categorisatie. Dit onderzoek heeft daarom als doel om het FvD te categoriseren binnen het rechts-populisme. Het onderzoek richt zich op de theorie van het radicaal rechts-populisme en het neoliberaal populisme. Aan de hand daarvan worden vijf criteria geformuleerd om het FvD te categoriseren. Hiervoor worden parlementaire documenten (amendementen, moties, vragen en wetsvoorstellen) en parlementaire stemmingen in de periode maart 2017 tot en met 2019 gebruikt. Daaruit blijkt dat het FvD voor vier van de vijf criteria binnen het radicaal rechts-populisme valt. Op één criteria is de partij meer neoliberaal populistisch. Daarom wordt er geconcludeerd dat het FvD een radicaal rechts-populistische partij is.",
After the collapse of a superpower: A quantitative analysis of the effect of Western influence on democratization in post-Soviet countries,"Vliet, Anouk van","['Otjes, S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis contributes to existing theories on democratization by examining the effect of Western influence on democratization in post-Soviet countries from 1991 until 2019. Western influence is divided in two dimensions: leverage as governments’ vulnerability to external pressure and linkage as the density of ties to the West. It is expected that leverage alone does not enhance democratization, but linkage does, and that a combination of high linkage and leverage has the strongest effect on democratization. Surprisingly, a factor analysis on the dimensions of linkage and leverage reveals that leverage is not a coherent concept as was expected beforehand. Moreover, after performing multiple OLS regressions, it is concluded that linkage has a strong effect on democratization, and some dimensions of leverage positively influence democratization. Finally, it cannot be concluded that an interaction effect exists whereby leverage enhances the effect of linkage on democratization. This is due to the lack of coherence between the leverage dimensions and due to conflicting results of the performed tests.",

By applying the counterargument technique in an online survey, this study has presented Dutch respondents with arguments that contradict their initially expressed opinion on UBI, in which the arguments would either be focused on the recipients of UBI, or on the financial consequences of implementing UBI. This study has demonstrated that within a Dutch sample of 557 respondents aged between 18 and 88 years and which predominantly consists of higher educated, left-leaning women with a general interest in politics, support for UBI is strong and predominantly robust. It proved harder to persuade the initial supporters of UBI than the initial opponents. The findings provide validity for the issue-specific explanation on attitude change, as respondents were more likely to be persuaded when the arguments are more in line with their ideological views. However, contrary to what was expected, the initial supporters who are socio-economically more left-wing were substantially more susceptible to the financial arguments than arguments on the recipients UBI, while the initial opponents who place themselves more towards the right were substantially more susceptible to the arguments on the recipients than the financial arguments. The findings of this study are relevant for scholars of political persuasion and those interested in the public legitimacy of the welfare state and UBI. It has shown that con arguments are not always more persuasive than pro arguments and that the content of the arguments matters for political persuasion on UBI. This can also inform advocates and opponents of UBI about the political feasibility of a coalition against or for the implementation of UBI.",

This thesis aims to challenge this by conducting a research on religious diversity and democratic support in Ghana on sub-national level. It analyses the following question: To what extent does religious diversity influence democratic support among religious people in Ghana? This thesis builds upon Robert Dowd’s (2015) theory, which suggests that religious diversity is a stimulus for accepting democracy among Muslims and Christians in Sub-Saharan Africa. I use the clustered version of Afrobarometer Round 5 Ghana in order to assess the relationship between religious diversity on micro-level and democratic support in Ghana. By conducting a multilevel logistic regression analysis, this paper finds that there is no significant relationship between religious diversity and democracy when analyzing for the religious groups Christianity, Islam, Pentecostalism and ‘Other’. Also, religious diversity does not significantly impact interreligious tolerance and political activism. When testing diversity for only Islam and Christianity, there is a significant relationship between religious diversity and democratic support in Ghana.",

In the examination of the relation between the phenomena, scholars often refer to either specific countries or resources. In this paper, a quantitative analysis is conducted to examine the general relationship between natural resources and child labour. Although several facets of natural resources are included, solely primary commodity exports exert a significant general influence on children’s engagement in economic activities. In more depth, the diamond gemstones industry is positively related to child labour. The implications of the research are twofold, the necessity of legally binding requirements on states to take measures against child labour. Out of this arises their responsibility to incorporate due diligence obligations on corporations, with an enhanced focus on the diamond industry.",

However, more recently, scholars have been investigating the question of gender related to conflicts, and if working towards gender equality could be a solution to many of the challenges faced today. Some researchers assert that the more gender-equal a state is, the less violence, between or within states, there is. Scholars differ in how they define and conceptualise gender equality, varying between political, educational, economic and social factors. Taking these scholarships into consideration, I investigate how political gender equality can influence the occurrence of intrastate conflict events. I use sex quotas in parliaments as a proxy of gender equality and hypothesise that their adoption lowers the occurrence of intrastate conflict events. I use a multiple linear regression analysis to test my hypothesis and conclude that legislating sex quotas reduces the occurrence of intrastate conflict events. However, the reduction of violence does not seem to be due to the increasing number of women in parliament, but may be emerging from gender equality norm acquisition at the elite level, or from international pressures, which may also explain the adoption of sex quotas.",

Its core hypothesis postulates that voters are more likely to reward incumbents with reelection if they pursue successful policies, as well as more likely sanction them with defection to opposition, if their policies fail for issues they consider to be salient. The thesis runs two separate studies using different measurements of the same theoretical concepts to check for robustness of results. The first study is based on individual-level data, while the second study employs macro-level data. Results of the first study suggest, that voters are more likely to reward incumbents for improving healthcare standards when healthcare-related issues are salient, but not more likely to sanction incumbents for worsening healthcare standards. Contrary to expectations, voters who are of the view that economic issues are salient, seem to be more likely to support incumbents when national economic conditions are regressing. For Study 2, the thesis found no significant effect – objective indicators of economic and healthcare quality performance as well as measures of economy and healthcare-related issues on a macro-level seem to be unrelated to government popularity, though data validty is suspected to play an important part in the outcome of the regressions of Study 1.",

De Jacksoniaanse wortels van Trumps buitenlandbeleid,"Cochius, Noud","['Wetering, C. van de', 'Spirova, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het buitenlandbeleid van president Donald Trump is de afgelopen vier jaren bijzonder grillig geweest. Zijn beleidskeuzes weerspraken niet alleen het werk van vorige administrations, maar soms ook dat van zijn eigen. Niet zelden wordt hij in de wetenschappelijke literatuur in het licht van het Jacksonianisme geplaatst (Cha, 2016; Clarke & Ricketts, 2017; Hamilton, 2017; Mead, 2017; Neumann, 2020). Echter, hoe zit het met het buitenlandbeleid van Trump? Walter Mead benadrukte recent nog dat Jacksonianisten zich niet bezig houden met politiek en zeker niet met buitenlandbeleid (2017, p. 4). Met dit onderzoek zal ik beargumenteren dat president Trump de normen en waarden van het Jacksonianisme bijna heeft vertaald in een buitenlandbeleid. De gemiddelde Jacksonianist heeft wellicht geen belangstelling voor buitenlandse politiek, maar Trump draagt de ideeën van het Jacksonianisme consequent uit op het wereldtoneel. De beleidskeuzes zijn niet alleen typisch Jacksoniaans, maar worden in speeches en interviews ook met een Jacksoniaans narratief door de president verdedigd. Jacksonianisme is dus niet alleen een ‘force to be reckoned with’, maar tot een echte beleidsstroming verworden in foreign policy",

Replicating the Uncertain: Using Degrees of Freedom Space of Original Articles to Choose Between Studies With a High Replication Value,"Datadin, Celess","[""Veer, A. van 't"", 'Heyman, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Flexibility in the decisions researchers make during their research can lead to false positive findings. Due to low transparency in published papers in the field of psychology, the amount of flexibility authors had is often unclear. In the current thesis, in a first step a quantitative measure of Replication Value is applied to a random set of studies (n = 1257) from Social Psychology, using citation count as a proxy for impact and sample size as a proxy for uncertainty. This Replication Value has been suggested as an indicator of how worthwhile it is to replicate a study (see Isager et al., in press), and can be applied to a large number of studies due to its quantitative approach. However, Replication Value is based on solely on quantitative proxies. Therefore, it is necessary to also manually examine papers. In a second step of the current thesis, it is manually explored whether the uncertainty that researchers have when making choices during their research can become clearer by mapping them. Therefore, the studies with the highest Replication Values (n = 10), with the median Replication Values (n = 10), and with the lowest Replication Values (n = 10) were examined on their reporting transparency and potential Researcher Degrees of Freedom. A detailed analysis of the first results indicated that the qualitative analysis of the Researcher Degrees of Freedom of original researchers is helpful to in selecting which study to replicate after making a larger selection based on RV. The findings from this exploratory research are discussed in the context of the field of Social Psychology, with an emphasis on how researchers looking to select a target for replication can use our DFS to map the uncertainty of original work.","['replication', 'Questionable Research Practices', 'Researcher Degrees of Freedom', 'social psychology', 'transparency']"

Women in peace: passive observers or meaningful participants? Does the inclusion of women in peace negotiations affect the level of female political participation in post-conflict states?,"Conway-Kenny, Rhona","['Masullo, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Does it make a difference whether women are included in peace negotiations or should it just be left to the men in charge? Arguably, there is a connection in this statement: including women in the peace process may reshape who is “in charge” by affecting levels of female political participation in the post-conflict environment. Though support for the idea that women should be involved in the peacebuilding process is almost unanimous, insufficient consideration has been given to how this involvement affects women in the longer-term, especially in relation to their political engagement. This thesis will build a theory about the relationship between women’s involvement in peace negotiations, and their subsequent levels of political participation. To do so, I will consider whether involvement in peace negotiations matters, and whether the type of involvement has varying degrees of impact. I theorize that the type women’s inclusion in the peace process affects the rate of political participation in two main ways: by causing a shift in cultural norms relating to the role of women and by altering the content of the agreement itself.",

Fatigue and Cardiovascular Response during Mental Stress Challenge in Coronary Artery Disease Patients after Acute Coronary Syndrome,"Gecaite-Stonciene, Julija","['van Houtum, L.', 'van den Berg, J.', 'Burkauskas, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. Fatigue and psychophysiological reactions to mental stress are known to be problematic in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. Currently, studies exploring the relationship between fatigue and cardiovascular reactivity to stress are scarce and inconsistent. The current study aimed to investigate the links between cardiovascular response to mental stress and fatigue in CAD patients after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods. The cross-sectional study investigated 142 CAD patients (85% male, 52±8 years) after ACS. Fatigue symptoms were measured using Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 20-items, while cardiovascular stress reactivity (i.e. change in systolic [s] and diastolic [d] blood pressure [ΔBP], and heart rate [ΔHR]) was evaluated during Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). In addition, participants completed Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, Type D Scale-14, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Visual Analog Scale. Multivariable linear regression analyses were completed to evaluate associations between fatigue and cardiovascular response to TSST, while controlling for confounders. Results. After controlling for baseline levels of cardiovascular measures, age, gender, education, New York Heart Association functional class, arterial hypertension, smoking history, use of nitrates, anxiety and depressive symptoms, Type D Personality, perceived difficulty and efforts, the cardiovascular reactivity to anticipatory stress remained significantly linked with global fatigue (ΔHR: β=-0.238; p=0.04), mental fatigue (ΔsBP: β=-0.244; p=0.04; ΔHR β=-0.303; p=0.01) and total fatigue score (ΔsBP: β=-0.331; p=0.01; ΔHR: β=-0.324; p=0.01). Conclusions: In CAD patients after ACS, fatigue was associated with diminished anticipatory stress during mental stress challenge, even after inclusion of possible confounders. Further similar studies exploring other psychophysiological stress responses are warranted.",
The Impact of Socioeconomic Status on Left-Right Ideology: The Case of Belgium,"Seminck, Ursula","['Robison, J.', 'Meffert, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Ideology and its origins are heavily studied and debated. Some claim socioeconomic status or the standing of a person in society is crucial and others say its influence on ideology is negligible. This thesis overviews the debate about ideology and the impact socioeconomic status (SES) has on it. The argument is made that socioeconomic status is influential in the formation of left-right ideology and that higher socioeconomic status leads one to be more right-wing and vice versa. SES is measured by looking at educational attainment, income level and employment. The argument is evaluated in the Belgian case using data of the 2018 European Social Survey. Belgium was selected as it exemplifies the relationship between socioeconomic status and left-right ideology, with the citizens from each region, namely Flanders and Wallonia, having different average SES and diverging ideological views. The findings demonstrate that socioeconomic status impacts left-right ideology and that the weight of SES as a determinant of it should not be ignored. However, the results also indicate that religiosity and gender are important for SES to have its hypothesized impact and even with the inclusion of the control variables, the association between SES and left-right ideology was not as significant as expected.",

Greece: How the government accession and the EU leverage affected the populist discourse of left-wing Syriza and right-wing Anel within the 2012-2019 period,"Ntaflos, Alexandros","['Otjes, S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study examines how the government accession within an EU country can affect the discourse of the left-wing and right-wing populist parties. We analyzed this question by tracing two Greek populist parties' discourse, the left-wing Syriza and the right-wing Independent Greeks (Anel), during the 2012-2019 period. We have split the examined period into two subperiods (2012 to July 2015, and August 2015 to 2019). The turning point was the Syriza-Anel government’s signature of the third EU bailout program in August 2015. The first hypothesis was that the government accession within the EU context would slightly decrease the populist logic of the two parties. The next two hypotheses referred that the EU leverage emerged by the signing of the bailout agreement will decrease the populist rhetoric of the two parties towards the external elites (mainly the EU). However, the right-wing populists (Anel)- even after this decrease- will target the external elites to a larger extent than the left-wing populists. To examine the hypotheses in-depth, we applied a combination of quantitative content analysis with qualitative discourse analysis. The findings have corroborated our three initial hypotheses. Simultaneously, the qualitative discourse analysis offered us some additional findings concerning the two parties' use of topos of “History” to increase their populist appeal within the electorate.",
The Association Between Depressive and Manic Symptoms with Cognitive Functioning over Time in Offspring of Parents with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder,"Maaskant, Eva","['Schomaker, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Schizophrenia (SZ) and Bipolar disorder (BD) are severe mental disorders with a substantial genetic component. Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of SZ and BD, and cognitive problems also occur in the offspring of SZ and BD patients. It is unclear how mood symptoms relate to cognition in this offspring group. This study examined the influence of the degree of mood symptoms, and therefore a more negative mood, on cognition in this high-risk offspring group by looking at mood symptoms as a continuous measure. As a follow-up, the effect of mood symptoms on cognition was examined again after four years. Methods: 134 SZ and BD offspring, and 49 controls performed the KSADS- PL (The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Present and Lifetime Version) and the ANT (Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks) at baseline (T1) and after approximately four years (T2). To examine if mood symptoms, age, sex, group (offspring or control), and the number of errors could predict cognitive scores on sustained attention, inhibition, and attentional flexibility, multiple linear regressions were performed. Results: At T1, sustained attention was the only cognitive domain that was associated with mood symptoms (B= .05, p= .001), indicating that more mood symptoms were related to worse sustained attention. Lower inhibition and attentional flexibility scores were predicted by age. At T2, sustained attention was significantly predicted by mood symptoms at T1 (B= .05, p= .001), indicating that more mood symptoms at T1 were associated with worse sustained attention after four years. Inhibition scores at T2 were not predicted by mood at T1, sex or age. At T2, attentional flexibility was predicted by age and sex. Group status (offspring or control) did not predict cognition. Conclusions: More mood symptoms are related to worse sustained attention in offspring and controls at baseline and after 4 years. Indicating that more mood symptoms in both the offspring and the control group caused lower sustained attention, rather than a genetic predisposition. Attentional flexibility and inhibition scores were not affected by mood symptoms at T1 and T2, but by age. Focusing on mood symptoms and their influence on cognition in high-risk offspring could help to refine and create screening and preventive methods and treatments.","['mood symptoms', 'offspring', 'cognition', 'bipolar disorder', 'schizophrenia']"

This paper seeks to offer new insight into the ways by which the Chinese state adapts to and utilizes technological advancements to their own advantage. At first, this paper provides an introduction of prominent existing literature on the relationship between Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and authoritarian regimes. The overarching motivation for this exploratory paper is that previous studies do not provide for a comprehensive enough overview of the use of ICT by the Chinese Communist Party (CPC). As such, the findings of this paper largely moves away from the well-documented ways in the literature on “repression technology” in China. This paper argues that the Chinese government has successfully aligned its interests with private technological corporations within the country, thus giving it a new avenue to e-governance and maintaining political legitimacy. The most prominent example that will be discussed is the use of digital technology for poverty alleviation purposes. Finally, the paper sheds light on the false dichotomy of “liberation technology” versus “repression technology”, arguing that the case of China does not fall into either category.",

Results from the entire sample showed that a higher degree of parental feelings of competence predicted fewer internalizing problems and more functional parent-child interactions. Contrary to expectations, the relationship between parental feelings of competence and internalizing problems was not mediated by parent-child interactions. Findings suggest that enhancing the feelings of parental competence may play a role in reducing the number of internalizing disorders among children. The two analyses of the parents with and without anxiety disorder 4 showed that parental feelings of competence is a predictor of (dis)functional parent-child interactions, but not of internalizing problems in the child. The current study contributes to the identification of risk factors for internalizing problems in the child. This can contribute to the improvement of (preventive) parent interventions.",

De rol van hechtingstijl bij de overdracht van angstsymptomen van ouder op kind,"Wanningen, Taïra","['Voogd, L. de', 'Asscheman, S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Parental anxiety is considered a risk factor for childhood anxiety disorders, but the mechanisms of this transmission are not yet sufficiently understood. An insecure attachment style is also a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders in children, so it is possible that the transmission takes place via attachment style. This research therefore investigates whether the relationship between anxiety of the parent and anxiety of the child can be explained via attachment. The research was conducted based on 162 participants between the ages of seven and fourteen years old, divided into a group of children of parents with an anxiety disorder (n = 78) and children of control parents (n = 84). Children filled in the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders71 (SCARED-71) and the attachment questionnaire for children (AQC) and the parents filled in the Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders -Adult (SCARED-A). No significant relationship was found between the parent’s anxiety and the child's attachment style and between parent's anxiety and the child's anxiety. A significant relationship was found between the attachment style of the child and the child’s anxiety. However, in conclusion, we did not find evidence that the transmission of anxiety from the parent to the child is through attachment.",

Identifying the factors for the development of an anxiety disorder in children is important for the development of prevention and intervention. Important risk factors for developing an anxiety disorder are having a parent with an anxiety disorder and a high level of behavioral inhibition in children. The current study investigates if the relationship between parental anxiety and the level of anxiety in a child is mediated by the level of behavioral inhibition in a child. Participants consisted of 71 children of parents with an anxiety disorder and 84 children of parents without an anxiety disorder at the age of 7 to 14 years (M = 10.16, SD = 1.58). The groups of parents with an anxiety disorder and parents without an anxiety disorder were determined on the basis of a MINI interview which diagnosed parents with an anxiety disorder or not. An anxiety (SCARED-71) and behavioral inhibition (BIS_C) scale for children were used to measure the level of anxiety and behavioral inhibition. The child as well as the parents have reported about the level of anxiety the child experiences. The current research showed that children of parents with an anxiety disorder experienced a higher level of anxiety when parents reported about the level of anxiety in the child. Furthermore, children of parents with an anxiety disorder did not show a higher level of behavioral inhibition and children with a higher level of behavioral inhibition experienced more anxiety only when children reported about the level of anxiety.",

De invloed van ouderlijke angst op hechtingsstijl en ouder-kind interacties: Een onderzoek naar mediatoren in de relatie tussen ouderlijke angst en angst bij kinderen van ouders met en zonder angststoornissen.,"Bakker, Meggie","['Voogd, L. de', 'Asscheman, S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"The current study has investigated whether attachment style and parent-child interactions mediated the relationship between parental anxiety and fear in children. In total, 71 children of parents with an anxiety disorder and 84 children of parents without an anxiety disorder participated in this study. Children were aged 7-14 years old. Both parents and children completed questionnaires once to measure attachment, parent-child interactions, parental anxiety, and child anxiety. The results of this study show that the relation between parental anxiety and child anxiety is mediated by attachment style. This effect was only found in the control group. Attachment style was a significant predictor of child anxiety. Parent-child interactions do not mediate the relationship between parental anxiety and child anxiety. Parent-child interactions only appear to be related to parental anxiety. Parents who experience higher levels of anxiety are less capable to effectively cope with conflicts with their children and they reported lower levels of acceptance in the relationship with their children. These effects have been found in both patient and control groups. In summary, attachment style is a 4 predictor of anxiety in children of parents without an anxiety disorder, and parental anxiety is a predictor of parent-child interactions in both groups. Current study can contribute to the existing treatments and interventions that are aimed at reducing the risk factors of children that are at increased risk of developing an anxiety disorder.",

Its research population consisted of children of parents without anxiety disorders, the healthy test group (n = 68), and children of at least one parent with a panic disorder, the panic test group (n = 40). The children were on average 10.11 years old (SD = 1.56). The children’s anxiety symptoms were assessed through the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders71 (SCARED-71), while parental anxiety symptoms were assessed through the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders-A (SCARED-A). Impactful parental experiences were assessed using a modified version of the List of Threatening Experiences (LTE). No mediation effect was found in the panic test group, but parental anxiety symptoms did significantly predict anxiety symptoms in children. The absence of the mediation effect may be connected to the parents receiving treatment for their panic disorder when the impactful experiences occurred. This may have weakened the predictive effect of impactful experiences on parental anxiety symptoms. However, the mediation effect was identified in the healthy test group, as an indirect effect. This confirms that the chances of children developing an anxiety disorder increase, when an impactful experience increases their healthy parent's anxiety symptoms. Some anxiety disorders in children can potentially be prevented, by offering parents appropriate treatment for anxiety symptoms after experiencing an impactful event. Due to the limitations of this study, further research should be conducted to confirm its results.",

Trump,"Otten, Nicola","['Van Willigen, N.', 'Blarel, N.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The type of discourse politicians employ can be used strategically to legitimise military interventions to the public. Within strategic discourse, gendering can take place in order to increase the sense of legitimacy to the public, as was done by Bush during the War on Terror in Afghanistan. This thesis aims to identify gendered constructions for the nation (the US), the enemy (ISIL) and the intervention within the legitimisation of the military intervention against ISIL. The thesis gives insights on the types of legitimisation strategies, and how gendering is used for the aim of legitimisation. By conducting a Critical and Theoretical Discourse Analysis of several speeches of president Obama and president Trump, the author finds that there are several gendered identities that are constructed in order to justify the intervention against ISIL. Both presidents feminise the enemy to legitimise the intervention. Whereas Obama uses soft-masculinity to construct the intervention and the nation, Trump uses hyper-masculinity to construct these identities. The author finds that there is a consistent use of emotional discourse, producing gendered constructions in order to legitimise the war against ISIL, therefore making gendering a constant throughout the legitimisation of the War on Terror.",

The case of Taiwan is especially interesting as it became a member of the WTO during a time in which Congress exercised more power and was weaker to lobbying activities. In this research we will be discussing the Formosan Association for Public Affairs. We will ask the question as to what extent did the FAPA utilize congressional access points in order to influence congressional support for the accession of Taiwan to the WTO. Because this is essentially a trade issue, we will use a theory by Sean D. Ehrlich (2007) in order to highlight US governmental policy making. The theory discusses how the number of access points influences free trade and protectionist lobbying activities, lobbying costs and thus policy outcome. This gives us a new perspective on activities by ethnic lobby groups in terms of trade policy. It attempts to explain the influence of institutional characteristics of a government on lobbying activities and why the accession of Taiwan succeeded, in contrast to their application to the WHO and the UN.",
