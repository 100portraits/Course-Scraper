Evolução do Código Penal Brasileiro em Relação à Violência de Gênero: Análise das Políticas Públicas contra o Feminicídio no Estado do Espírito Santo,"Dumas Carvalho van der Velde, Yohana","['Isla Monsalve, P.A.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Latijns-Amerikastudies (BA),Master thesis,pt,"A violência de gênero é considerada resultado de um sistema discriminatório estrutural e institucional onde a relação de dominação e subordinação foi consolidada ao longo dos anos nas relações entre homens e mulheres. Ademais, antes das décadas de 1960 e 1970, a participação da mulher nos processos sociais, suas idéias e representações além dos problemas que enfrentavam no seu cotidiano não eram considerados problemas sociais nem mesmo políticos. Porém, o papel das feministas (no âmbito mundial) na luta em defesa dos direitos humanos das mulheres e no combate à violência de gênero foi essencial para que a realidade de muitas mulheres no mundo ganhasse notoriedade e que as autoridades competentes assumissem a responsabilidade de garantir o direito à vida sem violência às mulheres. No contexto brasileiro, a ocorrência de casos de violência contra a mulher e de feminicídio envolvem números alarmantes no país. Ademais, o fator cultural e a relação de poder e dominação presente na maioria das relações interpessoais entre o homem e a mulher na sociedade brasileira, contribuem para a permanência e para o aumento desses tipos de violência. Haja vista que um dos fatores que podem explicar essa situação alarmante é que a sociedade brasileira, marcada pela ideologia patriarcal onde a mulher é subordinada ao homem, reforça o papel que ambas as partes assumem. O feminicídio, é considerado um crime que tem como base o ódio contra as mulheres (misoginia), e ocorre, muitas vezes no contexto de violência doméstica e familiar. Não obstante, foi durante os anos de 2006 e 2015, que o Código Penal brasileiro foi modificado a fim de combater a violência de gênero e o feminicídio.O objetivo dessa pesquisa é analisar os efeitos da evolução legislativa do CPB no marco das políticas públicas de prevenção e combate à violência de gênero e feminicídio no estado do Espírito Santo. E as perguntas centrais que guiaram essa pesquisa foram: em que medida os avanços do Código Penal brasileiro e as políticas públicas adotadas pelo governo do Espírito Santo (ES) estão contribuindo para a diminuição de casos de violência de gênero e de feminicídio? Assim mesmo e mais especificamente, interessa saber que tipos de políticas públicas o governo do ES adotou durante 2006 a 2017 para combater o feminício. Além das perguntas descritas, se parte da hipótese de que apesar das mudanças no Código Penal brasileiro e das políticas públicas adotadas pelo governo do ES para combater a violência de gênero, sendo todas elas importantes, não seriam suficientes para eliminar consideravelmente os casos de violência contra a mulher.","['Violência de gênero', 'Feminicídio', 'Violência contra mulheres', 'Feminicídio no Espírito Santo', 'Código Penal brasileiro', 'Lei Maria da Penha', 'Políticas públicas de gênero', 'Violência doméstica e familiar', 'Combate à violência de gênero no Brasil']"

The relevance of Marx and Social Economic Policy in Addressing the Socioeconomic Disparities Emerging from the Fourth Industrial Revolution.,"Drie, Oscar Roman James van","['Gerrits, A.W.M.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The fourth industrial revolution (4IR) is seen as the fourth time that a series of technological innovations will revolutionise the production and movement of goods. The prospect of a 4IR also sprouted a debate surrounding the socioeconomic implications that may come with these technological innovations. The 4IR could have grave consequences for low-skilled labourers. For example, the automation of production may result in a predicament where human labour can no longer compete with machines, which may decrease demand for low-skilled labour or make it redundant. As a result, in highly developed countries growing job insecurities may accelerate the growth of a “new dangerous class” called the precariat. This class could put pressure the political foundations of capitalist democratic societies. Moreover, in developing countries, automation of production may result in companies deciding to relocate their production back to highly developed countries where most of their consumers are based. As a consequence, developing countries can no longer depend on their comparative advantage of having an abundance of cheap labour. Hence, one can argue that the development strategy of development by way of industrialisation may become unworkable. In short, the 4IR may increase the gap between rich and poor, decrease social mobility and increased labour insecurity; all of which resonate with some of the contradictions that Karl Marx thought were endemic to the capitalist economy. This thesis will investigate this predicament through an analysis of the socioeconomic effects emerging from the 4IR and relating this to Marx’s critique of capitalism. The thesis aims to add to existing literature on Marx by considering the relevance of Marx in the 21st century.","['Marx', 'Karl', 'Economic inequality', 'Low-skilled labour', 'Labour redundancy', 'Technological innovation', 'Fourth Industrial Revolution', 'Industry 4.0', 'Geographical labour advantage', '4IR']"
Samenwerken of tegenwerken? Een studie naar de politisering van inlichtingen over Indonesië door Nederland in de aanloop naar de bezetting van Indonesië (1942-1945),"Arkel, André van","['Brocades Zaalberg, Thijs']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Na de capitulatie van Japan was het zaak Indonesië weer te bezetten. Nederland was zelf niet in staat om dit te doen en was afhankelijk van Groot-Brittannië die tevens de verantwoordelijkheid over Indonesië had gekregen. Nederland had er baat bij als Groot-Brittannië Indonesië zo snel mogelijk zou bezetten. Dit was voor Nederland belangrijk, want dan konden er zo snel mogelijk inkomsten in Indonesië voor de wederopbouw van Nederland gegenereerd worden en kon de op 17 augustus 1945 uitgeroepen Republik Indonesia zo snel mogelijk tegengewerkt worden. Nederland probeerde het beeld van Groot-Brittannië over Indonesië actief te beïnvloeden zodat de bezetting van Indonesië zo snel mogelijk zou plaatsvinden. Het manipuleren, achterhouden of fabriceren van inlichtingen binnen een inlichtingenuitwisseling om een politiek doel te behalen noemt men het 'politiseren van inlichtingen'. Nederland heeft het beeld dat Groot-Brittannië over Indonesië had actief beïnvloed door inlichtingen over Indonesië te politiseren. In dit BA-eindwerk word er gekeken naar de politisering van inlichtingen op het gebied van de houding van de Indonesische bevolking ten opzichte van de Nederlanders en het beeld dat Groot-Brittannië had van de sterkte van de Republiek. Deze BA-scriptie gaat in op de staat van inlichtingen tijdens de Tweede Wereldoorlog, de motieven van Nederland om inlichtingen te politiseren en de politisering van inlichtingen op de twee bovengenoemde onderwerpen.","['Indonesië', 'Inlichtingen', 'Groot-Britannië', 'Nederland', 'Politisering', 'International Intelligence Co-operation', 'International Intelligence Liaison', 'Indonesische Onafhankelijkheidsoorlog', 'Netherlands Indies Forces Intelligence Service']"

Retaining Style in Subtitles for Children: A Functional and Stylistic Approach to Subtitling The Gruffalo,"Walrave, Maureen","['Bovelander, Maud']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Recent years have shown an increase of research into audiovisual translation, but the field of audiovisual translation for children remains severely understudied. Academically, this field is understudied because of the low prestige of subtitling in general and children as the audience in particular (O’Connell, 2003). In practice, subtitles for children are uncommon, because children’s programs are often dubbed (O’Connell, 1999). Rhyme for children is not considered a ‘serious’ area of translation in any medium (Nasi, 2012), but combined with subtitles this field has barely received any academic attention. However, scholars in the field of literary translation argue that style and content together form the meaning of a text and therefore style is important to maintain in translation (Boase-Beier, 2014). Consequently, the purpose of this thesis was to identify the stylistic features present in the English original and Dutch translation of the children’s illustrated book The Gruffalo, before creating new, style-centered subtitles to accompany the movie of the same name. A functional analysis based on Nord (2005) showed that the functions of the texts were to entertain children and teach them new elements of language. A linguistic and stylistic analysis after Leech & Short’s checklist (2007) showed that the most important stylistic features in the book and its translation were rhyme, rhythm and repetition. To recreate the functions in translation, the stylistic features needed to be transferred into Dutch. Style-centered subtitles were created in the form of an annotated translation, but it proved difficult to forget about subtitling’s vulnerability: that the audience can hear the original and see the translation at the same time. Nevertheless, I will argue that it is possible to create style-centered subtitles for children, as the annotated translation does contain rhyme, rhythm and repetition.","['subtitling rhyme', 'subtitles for children', 'retranslation']"

Disconnected: Why Social Networking Sites have not democratized Zimbabwe's socio-political society,"Rozemeijer, Linde","['De Bruijn, Mirjam']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Academic research on the influence of Social Networking Sites on democratization-processes in autocratic regimes in Africa is often centered on the bottom-up, citizen-driven possibilities of social media, arguing that these factors enforce processes of mobilization and free information-access, ultimately resulting in a form of democratization. Drawing conclusions from the Arab Spring, the prediction was made that Zimbabwe could follow the same course of action. So far however, decisive democratic change there has not yet been observed. This study brings forward the argument that the absence of this democratic change can be explained through the presence of four conditions, namely a digital divide, the particulars of Zimbabwean political society, the online/offline-aspect in Zimbabwean socio-politics and the Zimbabwean media-landscape. Building on primary data and secondary literature, this thesis aims to bring nuance to the discussion concerning the interplay between communication-technologies and socio-political developments, in the specific case of Zimbabwe but also in a larger African- and global context.","['Social Media', 'SNS', 'democratizationprocesses', 'democratic change']"

Considering Rawls's Political Move: A Critical Analysis of Political Liberalism and Its Critics,"Price, Dominic","['Meijers, Tim']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This thesis critically analyses the success of John Rawls’s political liberalism, which recast his theory of justice from a comprehensive doctrine to a political conception. This analysis into Rawlsian political liberalism involves an examination of the way in which political liberals have responded to the objections raised by critics of the theory. Through analysing the problem of asymmetry in political liberalism, this thesis argues that political liberalism is only able to remain viable on the basis of the notion of reasonableness, which characterises the group of highly idealised, reasonable citizens. These citizens are immensely important to political liberalism, since they have the role of deliberating on and justifying the political conception of justice. In order for political liberalism to remain a tenable account of how agreement can be reached on the principles of justice, the idea of reasonableness requires justification. Political liberals attempt to accomplish this by appealing to the public political culture, and the shared political ideas found within it, which all democratically-aligned citizens will endorse. This thesis also argues that such a claim cannot be made, since the political ideas are subject to interpretation and thus not shared. It is also illustrated that political liberals cannot ground their theory in the support of committed democrats, since disagreement over the ideas of democracy and reasonableness are likely. After concluding that political liberalism cannot be defended, the last chapter of this thesis focuses upon a perfectionist liberalism, which Rawls argues must be rejected. This thesis argues that, on the contrary, perfectionist liberalism may be able to overcome the problems that political liberals associate with it.","['Political liberalism', 'Rawls', 'Asymmetry', 'Reasonable Disagreement']"

Explicit knowledge about implicit errors in L1 and L2 Dutch. An analysis of L1 and L2 accuracy.,"Goeijen, Anne Marije de","['Jong, Nivja de']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates implicit accuracy, which is considered the ability to use structures and rules that have become internalized and can thus be uttered easily, and explicit accuracy, defined as the presence of linguistic items learnt by the L2 speaker that have not yet been transferred in implicit accuracy. To investigate in what respect L1, beginning L2 and advanced L2 speakers of Dutch differ in terms of implicit accuracy, spontaneous speech was elicited by two speech tasks. Speech performances were transcribed and coded for accuracy. Types of errors were marked and by use of five measures, implicit accuracy was investigated. Two MANOVAs were run to examine how L1 and L2 accuracy differs and how lower and higher proficient L2 accuracy differs. Significant differences with respect to error density and error type density were found. Correction of error was not found to differ significantly across groups of speakers. The qualitative analysis delved into explicit accuracy, which was examined by stimulated recall sessions: participants were asked to listen carefully to their own speech and to comment on errors, hesitations and the overall process of speaking. These comments were categorized by the researcher. Chi square analyses revealed that as proficiency increases, participants report less on lexical problems but more on affined aspects as task-related issues. L1 speakers specifically report mainly on issues of focus and temporal planning. This study confirms that both implicit and explicit accuracy differs across L1 and L2 speakers and across lower and higher proficient L2 speakers.","['accuracy', 'CAF', 'stimulated recall', 'L2 proficiency']"

Effective Trolling: A Comparative Case Study,"Hak, Giotto Valentino Ainsley","['Jeffery, Jill']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This paper investigates the effects of various forms of trolling. This investigation was conducted by means of a multiple case study, contrasting a real-life trolling campaign that spread the phrase “It’s Okay To Be White” across several university campuses against an instance of online flaming against an individual. Both the campaign and the flaming had originated from the website 4chan. These two cases will be contrasted in term of effectiveness by means of the responses to the trolling and flaming respectively. These responses were hierarchically classified by applying Baker’s (2001) six forms of responding to flaming in terms of progressively increasing aggression towards the person or message they were directed towards. From the comparison of these cases, it appeared that while the It’s Okay To Be White-campaign (henceforth abbreviated as the IOTBW-campaign) did manage to garner more attention through the traditional media, the responses to the case of online flaming had been far more explicit as well as aggressive and thereby more effective. The implication this has for trolling is that while a large number of views and responses are certainly a requirement for the success of trolling, it does not signify effective trolling. Rather, the quality of the responses (aggressive and emotionally loaded language) is a more adequate determiner for effectiveness in trolling. Future research might look into quantitative analyses of aggressive responses to trolling and flaming alike.","['Flaming', 'Online', 'Offline', 'Trolling']"
Poison in Rhodesia,"Wittenberg, Colm","['Gewald, J.B.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the final stages of the Rhodesian Bush War (1975-1980), the white minority government and its Security Forces found themselves on the losing side. In an attempt to combat the flood of guerrillas entering the country, the Rhodesians turned to chemical and biological weapons (CBWs). From 1976 onwards a secret program within the Rhodesian army created, experimented with, and deployed poisons. Water sources were contaminated and doctored clothes and food were entered in the guerrillas’ supply lines. Expanding on existing knowledge about both the war and the CBW program, this thesis takes a closer look at the role poisons played in this conflict. The main purpose of these weapons was to kill guerrillas, for which they were very effective; sometimes even more effective than the standard anti-insurgency strategies the Rhodesians used. The use of poisons also changed the relationship between guerrillas and civilians. The Rhodesians often used civilians to provide the guerrillas with the poisoned goods. When these men or women were discovered, the guerrillas would retaliate. In the early stages of the program this drove a wedge between civilians and guerrillas. According to some scholars this was a serendipitous effect, according to others it was a calculated move in the battle for the hearts and minds of the rural African population. This thesis argues that the Rhodesian’s use of CBWs has helped the guerrillas in gaining legitimacy. Because of the strong connection between poison and witchcraft, the guerrillas were not merely targeted by chemical substances, they were targeted by witches. Because of that, the guerrillas could assume the role of witch-hunter in the eyes of the rural black population. Hunting witches was normally done by Mhondoro, ancestral spirits who control and watch over a piece of land. With the help of spirit mediums and by hunting witches, the guerrillas became living manifestations of Mhondoro spirits, gaining legitimacy over the land in the process. Conquering strangers became familiar liberators.",

Weaponising unresolved pasts: The impact of victimhood narratives on societal reconciliation in Spain and the Basque Country in the aftermath of ETA,"Zejdlova, Katerina","['Storm, H.J.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The thesis explores the socio-political climate in Spain and the Basque country in the aftermath of the definitive 2011 ceasefire and the eventual 2018 dissolution of the Basque nationalist militant group Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA), coming after more than half a century of its armed struggle against the Spanish state. Despite the end of physical violence, its legacies nevertheless still echo in the Basque Country and in Spain as a whole. The thesis analyses the highly polarised ‘fringe’ yet influential “Abertzale” and “Spanish nationalist” narratives which reflect these legacies, with fundamentally opposed parties effectively utilising these discourses as rhetorical weapons in public discourse and politics. A particular feature standing out in these narratives is the problematic conceptualisation of victimhood. The thesis examines these post-2011 narratives of victimhood in detail, specifically focusing on how they detrimentally affect the prospects for societal reconciliation following the end of ETA, whilst taking into account the complex historical burdens of the Basque case and the controversial legacies of the Francoist dictatorship which further entrench these narratives. Furthermore, the conceptualisations of victimhood in the often-compared Northern Irish case are scrutinised in order to devise a theoretical framework for this largely unexplored concept in the Basque case. It is finally concluded that clashing victimhood claims, deeply intertwined with the long-standing narratives of “political conflict” and “terrorism,” fundamentally impede progress towards reconciliation in the Basque case. The thesis suggests a victim-centric approach as well as a push for inclusive conceptualisations of victimhood may be the key avenues to explore in order to pursue societal reconciliation in the post-ETA era.","['Basque Country', 'ETA', 'narratives of victimhood', 'post-conflict reconciliation', 'separatist terrorism', 'political conflict', 'Spanish memory debates', 'Northern Ireland', 'Spanish nationalism', 'izquierda abertzale']"

Een verklaring voor de inaccurate tactische inlichtingen van de NEFIS over de situatie op Java tijdens de Eerste Politionele Actie,"Koster, Stefan","['Brocades Zaalberg, Thijs']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Tussen 1945 en 1949 was Nederland in oorlog met de Indonesische Republiek die was uitgeroepen op 17 augustus 1945 na de capitulatie van Japan. Nederland had tijdens dit conflict veel moeite met de manier van oorlogvoering, vooral vanwege een verkeerd heersend beeld van de tegenstander. Tijdens deze oorlog speelde de Netherlands Eastern Forces Intelligence Service (NEFIS) een belangrijke rol bij de vorming van het verkeerde beeld. Dit leidt tot de volgende onderzoeksvraag: Hoe zijn de onnauwkeurige verwachtingen die de NEFIS had van de situatie op Java voor de Eerste Politionele Actie te verklaren? Om de hoofdvraag te kunnen beantwoorden maakt dit onderzoek gebruik van NEFIS rapporten en moderne literatuur. De meest belangrijke bevinding van het onderzoek is dat de duidelijke tweedeling die de NEFIS maakte tussen de gewone bevolking en de strijdgroepen een belangrijke reden is geweest dat de verwachtingen die zij hadden niet overeenkwamen met de realiteit. De NEFIS verwachtte steun van de bevolking tegen een Republikeins leger. Maar in plaats daarvan ging het om een guerrilla strijd waarin de gewone bevolking, vrijwillig of niet, ook verwikkeld was. Het onderscheid tussen soldaat en burger was tijdens de Eerste Politionele Actie niet zo zwart wit als de NEFIS in eerste instantie geloofde. Doordat de NEFIS het idee had dat er wel een duidelijke lijn tussen de twee groepen zat, waren de inlichtingen al van minder waarde op het moment dat zij geïnitieerd werden en kwamen de oorspronkelijke verwachtingen niet overeen met de meer chaotische situatie zoals die waarschijnlijk is geweest. Deze scriptie vult de bestaande literatuur aan door het aspect van gebrekkige en gekleurde informatie, dat in de literatuur slechts gedeeltelijk behandeld wordt, op te pakken en dit samen met de redenen voor de onbetrouwbaarheid op zichzelf te onderzoeken. Daarbij geldt deze scriptie als uitgangspunt voor vervolgonderzoek.","['NEFIS', 'Indonesië', 'Dekolonisatie', 'Onafhankelijkheid', 'Counter-Insurgency', 'Inlichtingen', 'Eerste Politionele Actie']"

Wonder Woman: The Neoliberal Appropriation of Feminism in Japan’s Womenomics Policy,"Sharif, Shafiqa Allysa Thallah","['Koyama, Hitomi']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The link between international development and gender equality has been highly acknowledged in today’s world. Women and girls are often depicted to be the public faces of global development, and have been increasingly present in a wide range of business and institutional policies. Businesses and institutions have embraced the notion that women are beneficial for markets and profits. This idea of the economic benefits of capitalizing on female ‘untapped’ labor power is also known as ‘smart economics’. Such neoliberal implementations and legislations illustrate that, instead of mere victims of poverty and violence, women are also capable to be agents. Nonetheless, these supposed advantages are in need of a feminist analysis. Recently, the Japanese government led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe set out to implement a gender equality initiative labeled as ‘Womenomics’. This policy is primarily implemented to increase female participation in the workforce. Womenomics is narrowly linked to the expansion of a neoliberal economic policy agenda, which represents market fundamentalism, privatization, and corporate-led development. This thesis will analyze to what extend Japan’s neoliberalism, and its promise for female empowerment affects gender equality in the country. Fundamental to this analysis is the connection between feminism and a neoliberal economic policy like womenomics. The idea of feminism can reveal to what extend it can be utilized to achieve the neoliberal goal of a free and flexible labor market (Schieder 53 – 54). The central question this thesis seeks to answer is: ‘how has feminism influenced Japan’s decision to implement its neoliberal womenomics policy?’. The thesis hypotheses is that while womenomics promotes female (economic) empowerment, the policy disregards historical and structural causes of gender-based inequality and poverty. Moreover, it is reinforcing the (current) neoliberal paradigm, which established and maintained (gender-based) oppression.","['Japan', 'Feminism', 'Neoliberalism', 'Womenomics', 'Women']"

In particular, opium travels from (mainly) Afghanistan to parts all over the world, carried by all sorts of groups and organizations that have specialized in this trade. The PKK is active in a number of regions in the Middle-East and illicit drug trade is one of the means of its financing. Using the crime-terror continuum of Makarenko, this research describes the PKK as a commercial terrorist organization with mainly financial interests, at present stronger than their political motives. The research question of this thesis is as follows: “To what extent has the Kurdistan Workers’ Party transformed into a criminal organization from its erewhile politically motivated terrorist origins?” The relevance of this research is therefore to give the PKK a spot on the crime- terror continuum of Makarenko (2004: 131) and to show its evolution into a transnational organized crime organization, rather than just a static politically driven organization. This research could improve the formulation and implementation of future counter measures. The hypothesis of this thesis is that the PKK can be defined as a predominantly commercial terrorist organization.","['Terrorism', 'crime-terror nexus', 'PKK']"
Loving Idols,"Cate, Alexander Ellin ten","['Chouraqui, F.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"If one looks at love in popular culture one sees that the current attitude towards love is one of idolatry. This thesis explains what this popular conception of love is (largely) based on. Current love has its roots in Christianity and thus, by extension, Platonic thought. This thesis therefore examines some of the most essential characteristics of love in Christianity. These characteristics help to analyze the resemblance between love in Christianity and love in popular culture. Furthermore this thesis explores whether or not popular love could have been born out of ancient Greek philosophy or that these resemblances between popular and Christian love come from the fact that both schools are simply right about the nature of love. It is for that reason that this thesis briefly examines the potential heritage (of love) between Christianity and ancient Greece. Moreover, while it is impossible to prove that Christianity and popular culture are not right about love, this thesis provides a secular conceptualization of love which does not share the previously mentioned essential characteristics. This conceptualization ‘love as bestowal and affirmation’ is deeply rooted in the works of Singer, May and Nietzsche and will provide a secular view on love. This to show that it is possible to create a probably conceptualization of love completely separate from the Christian framework.","['Christianity', 'Love', 'Philosophy', 'Theology', 'Nietzsche', 'Plato', 'Culture', 'Singer', 'Supreme Virtue', 'Idolatry']"

Dit beleid was geïnspireerd op de sociale beweging van de antipsychiatrie. De kritiek op deze methode liep uit tot een discussie waar de media, de politiek en de Nederlandse bevolking zich mee bemoeiden. Uiteindelijk werd op 3 juli 1974 Dennendal door de politie ontruimd, waarmee de affaire tot een dramatisch einde kwam.

In het eerste hoofdstuk staan de culturele veranderingen van Nederland in de jaren vijftig en zestig centraal. Deze veranderingen leidden tot het ontstaan van nieuwe sociale bewegingen, zoals de antipsychiatrie, die in het tweede hoofdstuk worden geanalyseerd.

Instead of increasing government legitimacy, winning the Chechen population's 'hearts and minds' and in this way realising a durable solution to the Chechen conflict, the Putin administration relied mainly on at first mostly indiscriminate and later more selective violence and repression, for which it relied on an indigenous counterinsurgency force under the command of the Kadyrovs, in order to coerce the Chechens in compliance. At the same time, the Putin administration placed a lot of effort in preventing the national will to continue fighting in Chechnya from eroding by making the Chechen conflict invisible, creating the impression of normalisation and reducing Russian casualties. To this end, the Kremlin tried to reduce the freedom of the press and bring the media and civil society, which it viewed as a threat to its war effort, under its control, while at the same time it increasingly came to rely on its Chechen proxies, who in the mid-2000s took over the brunt of the counterinsurgency operations from the Russian military. Thus, although the Putin regime in the early 2000s was still regarded as a 'hybrid' or 'transitional' regime, the Russian counterinsurgency campaign in Chechnya from late 1999 demonstrates that Putin and the members of his inner circle from the start viewed democracy, free media and a strong and vibrant civil society as threats to their ability to govern, their war effort in Chechnya and their own positions.","['Chechnya', 'second Chechen war', 'counterinsurgency', 'Russia', 'Putin regime']"

English-Only movements have emerged, also known as Official English Movements. Such movements try to establish English as the only official language and also believe that the protection of English is necessary, due to the arrival of a large number of immigrants with other first languages. The U.S. English organization says that it is not against people who speak other languages, but is against the idea of the government working in other languages, because it allegedly divides the country. At the moment, Donald Trump has also been shaping up as a fierce supporter of the English-Only Movement. This study focuses on the impact of English-Only movements on attitudes towards Spanish, given that the Spanish-speaking population forms an increasingly important group in the US, both in economic and political terms. There are many social factors that influence attitudes towards languages. The question is to what extent President Donald Trump and the English-Only Movements contribute to these attitudes regarding the Spanish language and the corresponding alleged discrimination. This study analyzes whether the English-Only Movements negatively influence the perceived status of Spanish.","['language attitudes', 'spanish', 'USA', 'English-Only', 'Donald Trump']"

Vivo en un ciudad pequeño: Nominal Agreement in the Acquisition of Spanish as a Second Language,"Kok, Myrte","['González González, Paz']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"An interesting topic of research in second language acquisition is whether learners can achieve a native-like language, even though certain features do not occur in their native language. There are numerous studies on native English speakers learning Spanish as a second language. However, there are not many researchers who investigated the Spanish interlanguage of native Dutch speakers. Therefore, this study investigates the Spanish acquisition of Dutch students from Leiden University. The feature that is being analysed is nominal agreement, the agreement between a noun and its linked elements, such as determiners and adjectives. The information of the gender and number of the noun is displayed in these elements (la ciudad pequeña, “the small city” and el pueblo pequeño, “the small town”). The participants were divided into three different proficiency groups: beginner, intermediate and advanced. They all had to answer three essay questions, which were analysed on the correct use of nominal agreement. Results showed that how higher the proficiency level of the speaker, how more native-like the language becomes. Participants made more errors with plural and feminine nouns than with singular and masculine nouns, which demonstrates that singular and masculine are used as default. Whether speakers find the determiner-noun agreement easier than the noun-adjective agreement will still be a subject to further discuss.",['Nominal Agreement in the Acquisition of Spanish as a L2']

Er is gekeken of de kop (sensationeel of niet-sensationeel) en de bron (nieuwsmedium of lifestyle medium) invloed hebben op de beoordeling van de betrouwbaarheid door een specifieke doelgroep, namelijk jonge vrouwen tussen de 18-26 jaar. Naast de waargenomen betrouwbaarheid worden ook de deskundigheid, aantrekkelijkheid en attitude gemeten. De onderzoeksvraag luidt: Hoe beoordelen jonge vrouwen de betrouwbaarheid van sensatieberichtgeving op Facebook, dat gebaseerd is op wetenschappelijk onderzoek? Dit is onderzocht door middel van een online experiment waarbij proefpersonen een nagebootste Facebookpost te zien kregen van RTL Nieuws of Cosmopolitan met sensationele kop of een niet-sensationele kop. Daarna moesten zij vragen beantwoorden waarna de waargenomen betrouwbaarheid, deskundigheid, aantrekkelijkheid en attitude gemeten werd. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat Facebookposts van een nieuwsmedium met een niet-sensationele kop als meest betrouwbaar worden gezien, en posts van een lifestyle medium met sensationele kop als het minst betrouwbaar. Toch waren de gemiddelde scores in alle condities relatief aan de lage kant, wat wellicht duidt op een sceptische houding tegenover wetenschappelijk nieuws, geschreven door zowel nieuwsmedia als lifestyle media. Of dat zo is, moet uit toekomstig onderzoek blijken.","['Facebook', 'betrouwbaarheid', 'message credibility', 'source credibility', 'social media', 'sensatieberichtgeving', 'deskundigheid', 'online nieuws', 'tabloidization']"

The acquisition of gender agreement between determiner-noun-adjective by Dutch L2 speakers of Spanish,"Sterken, Bo","['Parafita, Couto M.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Latijns-Amerikastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study investigates the acquisition of gender agreement between determiner- noun-adjective by Spanish L2 speakers whose L1 is Dutch, and tests the effect of language proficiency by comparing beginner- intermediate- advanced Dutch speakers of Spanish. Earlier research on second language acquisition, like research on the Feature Reassembly Hypothesis (Hwang and Lardiere 2013; Lardiere 2009) that states that acquisition of uninterpretable features like grammatical gender pose difficulty, together with the differences between languages when it comes to their gender systems, have led to this study. Both Dutch and Spanish have grammatical gender with a binary system. This system is particularly transparent in Spanish gender, since nouns ending in –o tend to be masculine and nouns ending in –a feminine. Whereas in Dutch the gender system is less transparent, based on common gender (de) or neuter gender (het). Given this background, how is the acquisition of gender agreement between determiner- noun- adjective by Spanish L2 speakers whose L1 is Dutch? Comparing beginner, intermediate and advanced Dutch L2 learners of Spanish, which has been done in earlier investigations on English L2 learners of Spanish (Sagarra and Herschensohn 2011), gives us an insight on the effect of proficiency. I used the Leiden Learner Corpus (LLC), a collection of data from Dutch learners of Romance languages to extract determiner- noun-adjective combinations, produced by Dutch speaking participants who are studying Spanish as their L2 or L3 at Leiden University (n= 27; 10 beginners, 6 intermediate and 11 advanced). An overall better performance on gender agreement by higher proficiency levels was found. The performance on gender agreement between determiner- noun was better than the performance on gender agreement between determiner- noun- adjective. This research creates a new angle on the acquisition of gender agreement between the determiner- noun- adjective structure because it is the first study on a new language pair: Dutch- Spanish.","['Second Language Acquisition', 'Spanish', 'Dutch', 'Gender Agreement']"

Pluralist Populism: How Populism and Liberal Democracy can Coexist,"Marry, Brandon","['Fossen, T.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"I will argue in this thesis, that those within the field of democratic theory who dismiss populism as an inherent threat to liberal democracy do so based on a number of assumptions. The first of these assumptions concerns how populism should be defined, some within the literature treat it as an ideology in itself, defined by its distinctly illiberal aims. Others treat it as a style of doing politics, yet argue that by dividing society between ‘us’ and ‘them’, it violates liberal commitments to pluralism. The second assumption concerns the point of liberal democracy; theorists who dismiss populism as a threat to liberal democracy frequently do so based on their commitment to a particular normative theory of democracy, which is often not made explicit in their work. The third assumption is that there is no fundamental contradiction between the liberal and democratic dimensions of liberal democracy, but rather that the two presuppose each other. This thesis will aim to challenge these assumptions in turn, illuminating the normative commitments of those who claim populism is a threat. I will begin by arguing that, based on the definition provided by Mouffe and Laclau, populism should be conceived of in hegemonic terms. Using this understanding of populism, I will challenge the assumption that populism is incompatible with commitments to pluralism. I analyse populism through the lenses of social-choice theory, representative democracy and deliberative democracy, in order to demonstrate that this perceived incompatibility is largely dependent on the theorists’ commitment to these normative theories, rather than populism itself. Lastly, I will argue against the “co-originality” thesis in favour of a conception of liberal democracy in which both its constitutive elements are in contradiction, but, as has been argued by Mouffe, this contradiction may be productive. I conclude by arguing in favour of an agonistic conception of democracy, as a means by which competing hegemonic projects, such as populism, can inhabit the same political sphere, thereby demonstrating that populism and pluralism are not necessarily incompatible.","['Populism', 'Democracy', 'Liberalism']"

Mapping Depoliticization in Contexts of Transitional Justice: An Analysis of the Case of Argentina,"Cavill, Harry","['Thakur, Vineet']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Considering the global boom in Transitional Justice (TJ) and its bureaucratization since the 1980s, critical multi-disciplinary scholars realised that ‘transitional’ discourses and practices were depoliticizing alternative political perspectives. But although they refer to interrelated phenomena, their language and chief academic objectives diverge, making depoliticization incoherent and under-conceptualized. This paper unifies prior efforts by asking what depoliticization is and tracing its consequences. We present six tentative definitions of depoliticization, categorise them into three types, and incorporate our preferred definition into our methodology. In a case study of TJ and post-transitional activism in Argentina during 1983-1996, we map its occurrence beginning with a depoliticizing move in 1983 by the Alfonsín administration that facilitated the production of Nunca Mas in 1984 and examine its relationship to the marginalization of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, a civil society organisation that emerged in response to mass disappearances under the former military junta. We conclude that depoliticization occurred and contributed to marginalization of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, having produced a clear conceptual framework for further applications of depoliticization in contexts of TJ.","['Transitional Justice', 'Depoliticization', 'Argentina', 'Humanitarianism', 'Liberal Peacebuilding', 'Truth', 'Reconciliation', 'Marginalization', 'Madres de Plaza de Mayo', 'Collective Memory']"

A problem for environmental pragmatism: value pluralism and the sustainability principle,"Loman, Okke","['Fossen, Thomas']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I claim that the recently emerged perspective of environmental pragmatism is nonviable. For many years, it was deemed impossible for environmental ethics to formulate justified environmental policy. Environmental pragmatism, and its primary scholar Bryan G. Norton, has promoted a new outlook in that debate by proposing an ideal methodology based upon classic American pragmatism. In this methodology, a community can determine what is morally righteous by (i) conducting open-ended inquiry and (ii) considering all relevant stakeholders in a rational discourse. Environmental pragmatism must therefore accommodate reasonable value pluralism. Moreover, Norton claims that these criteria should be complemented with what I call the ‘sustainability criterion’. However, this principle of righteous decisionmaking appears inconsistent with the two aforementioned commitments. This thesis considers the extent to which this is the case. As it turns out, environmental pragmatism is unable to reconcile the commitment of sustainability with reasonable value pluralism, when its ideal methodology is applied in practical terms. And, because environmental pragmatism aims to do so, I conclude that it is nonviable.","['environmental pragmatism', 'epistemology', 'sustainability', 'deliberation', 'Bryan G.

WHAT’S IN IT FOR ME? A Qualitative Research on the (Financial) Relation between Non-Governmental Organizations and Donor Organizations.,"De Lange, Laura","[""d'Hooghe, Ingrid""]",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) need to acquire donor funding to carry out projects. In the past, NGOs used to be progressive agents for social change. Nowadays, they are described as part of the development machine. The dependency of NGOs on donors and the competition between NGOs are both increasing. Donors also expect more reports from NGOs on projects. Altogether, the challenge for NGOs to get funding is increasing. At least, that is what the existing academic literature states. This research will examine these challenges for NGOs in the relation with donors for funding. It will answer the following research question: ‘What do Dutch NGOs see as the biggest challenge in the funding system with donors?’ The research will focus on the level of accountability, competition between NGOs for donor funding and dependency on donor funding. To answer the research question, a qualitative case study approach on Dutch NGOs was chosen. Semi-structured interviews with employees from Dutch NGOs were scheduled to gather data. This data explains how the three factors are perceived by the employees from Dutch NGOs and if this accords to the existing literature. The findings showed that the respondents from the NGOs did not unanimously express one of these three factors as burdensome.

Subtitles as a Tool Towards Language Acquisition,"Kappetijn, Merel","['Smakman, Dick']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study aims to investigate whether subtitles have a beneficial effect on incidental L2- vocabulary acquisition among students in the first grade of secondary school aged 12-13 years old. Previous studies seem to indicate that subtitles have a beneficial effect on L2-vocabulary acquisition in adults, and so a case study was devised to investigate the effects of subtitles on children. These children were subjected to a cartoon YouTube clip of approximately 3 minutes recounting Aesop’s fable ‘The Frogs Who Desired a King’; half of the children viewed this clip with subtitles in their native language, or L1, the other half with captions in their non-native language, or L2. This clip contained a total of 15 words that were assumed the children would not yet know. After having seen the clip, the children were asked to provide accurate translations of these words to test the possible effects of the subtitles. The eventual conclusion was that subtitles seemed to have no effect on incidental L2-vocabulary acquisition, while captions may actually prove beneficial.","['subtitles', 'captions', 'efl', 'L2-vocabulary acquisition']"

The analysis is based on the prediction of the book ""Unprecedented Pyongyang"", describing the transformation of the iconic monuments and the specific socialist morphology of Pyongyang to a more ""functional"" capitalistic city. By analyzing architecture, and the social production of such the thesis sheds light on the possible clash between the social and the political body in North Korea, explaining the mechanisms of cultural propaganda and especially advocating for the prevalence of agency in Pyongyang's inhabited space. The study is situated within the broader debate of globalization and modernization as possible external forces, being implemented in Pyongyang and represented in build form. The thesis questions whether the economic transitioning and a resulting spatial and social change also results in a temporal one, wherein Pyongyang ""catches up"" to the globalized and modernized world. Overall the conclusion shows that there are some major issues pertaining to how the processes of time and modernity are considered within International Relations.","['North Korea', 'Identity', 'Architecture', 'Sociology of International Relations', 'Urbanism']"

Domestic workers in Hong Kong,"Zeegers, Kelsey Josephine","['Regilme, Salvador Santino F.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"At the beginning of 2018, I did an internship at the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. Before I went there, a friend told me to read the book Maid to Order in Hong Kong, written by Nicole Constable. This book was full of stories about migrant workers seeking new jobs in Hong Kong for a better life. One particular chapter attracted my attention. It was the story about how domestic workers come together on Sundays, which is their only day off per week. They gather around on the Hong Kong Island and at other places in Hong Kong. The streets are filled with the so- called, domestic workers, most of them coming from the Philippines or Indonesia. When I visit these streets on Hong Kong Island I was overwhelmed by what I saw. Groups of these migrants were sitting on the ground, playing games, eating, laughing and dancing. Although it was interesting seeing people with so little, making the best way out of their life, there, is a whole different side to their lives. These groups are very vulnerable to exploitation and violation. There are so many stories of domestic workers being physically beaten or being exploited by their employers, but also how domestic workers cannot escape these awful situations through debt bondage of their recruitment agencies. However, over the last few years’ domestic workers are becoming more and more aware of their rights. NGOs are emerging to support these workers in foreign countries, but also several governmental interventions show increasing interest in the protection of migrants. Therefore, this thesis aim is to get a better understanding how multiple actors, like private institutions, recruitment agencies and NGOs impact the scope and frequency of migration, but more importantly how these actors create better opportunities for domestic workers to empower themselves.","['migration infrastructure', 'remittances', 'empowerment', 'foreign domestic workers']"

The Egyptian Military Empire: Civil-Military Relations and the Power of the Egyptian Military since the 2011 Revolution,"Bulthuis, Martha","['Henderson, C.J.V.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"During Mubarak’s presidency (1981-2011), civil-military relations in Egypt appeared stable. The military enjoyed several benefits, and Mubarak was guaranteed loyalty from the military. Until the revolution of 2011, when the military decided to side with the protestors, and Mubarak was forced to step down. Following the end of Mubarak’s reign, under the rule of the SCAF, Mohamed Morsi, and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, civil-military relations in Egypt have changed. This thesis argues that the changed civil-military relations in Egypt since the 2011 revolution have resulted in an increase of the power of the military. Firstly, economic privileges for the military have increased since Mubarak’s presidency ended, which in turn enabled the military to further establish their grip on power. Secondly, the number of civilian cases that have been transferred to military courts increased significantly after the downfall of Mubarak. As military judges are rarely impartial and favor the military, these courts have served as a way to silent the military’s opposition. Thirdly, a series of new laws, amendments and the new constitution of 2014 granted the military more privileges and the high number of military men appointed to senior government positions increased the political influence and power of the military. Thus, the power of the Egyptian military has increased after civil-military relations changed since the revolution of 2011. At the hands of a regime that favors the military, the military has been able to expand their grip on power through their economic activities, civilian trials in military courts, and through legislative changes.","['Civil-military relations', '2011 Revolution', 'Military power']"
The political and strategic importance of the 2016 EU-Turkey Refugee Agreement for the governance of migration,"Basaran, Zeynep","[""O'Malley, A.M. (Alanna)""]",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The main argument of this MAIR thesis is that the lack of political motives between the EU and Turkey, towards a common response to migration, resulted in a controversial Refugee Agreement in March 2016, which accelerated the number of irregular migrants as well as migrant smugglers and could not provide a long-lasting solution. This thesis aims to identify the process, problems, concerns and the lack of transparency, which eventually resulted in the establishment of this agreement, by reviewing the directives of the UN and EU, and to conclude with possible policy recommendations for further migration discussions, with an emphasis on existing literature on common asylum policies. The coordinated action between the EU and Turkey which eventually resulted in the 2016 Refugee Agreement underlined some multilateral promises that for one Syrian readmitted back to Turkey from densely refugee-populated Greek Islands, there will be another Syrian refugee resettled in an EU Member State in addition to the financial contribution to the Turkish government. This mechanism, in regard to various criticisms from the international community as well as human rights organisations and various scholars, could not ensure the desired stability for the migration crisis, likewise left the people seeking asylum in uncertainty and under inhumane circumstances. There are still thousands of people claiming asylum not only in the reception centres among the European Member States, especially Southern islands of Greece but also in the cities of the Southern part of Turkey where the political and economic capacity have been deteriorating.","['EU-Turkey Refugee Agreement', 'Governance of Migration', 'Irregular migrants', 'Mediterranean', 'International refugee law', 'International human rights law', 'Dublin Convention', 'Geneva Convention of 1951', 'Immigration policies']"

Politics in Rap Lyrics: A Corpus Study,"Kam, Tim de","['Fonteyn, Lauren']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Although rap has seen a lot of criticism for its aggressive content, vulgar language, and questionable icons, it has also gained praise for its poetic nature. The praise comes not only from its core audience, but also from scholars and literary connoisseurs. In recent years more and more research has been done in this field and this thesis also has rap lyrics as its main focus. The main themes in rap studies are birthed from and aimed at the negative aspects of rap lyrics, including; racism, sexism, and aggression. However, as one of the people who sees rap as an expression of creativity and wit, I will focus on a more positive end of the broad rap spectrum. Because I experience a lot of political subjects in recent popular rap songs, I decided I wanted to find out whether rap lyrics contain more political themes than other genres. This thesis will take a quantitative approach to the matter at hand by using a large rap lyrics corpus as its main focus. Through corpus linguistics methodology and with the help of corpus analysis software I aim to provide empirical evidence for the political content of rap lyrics. Using a broader lyrical genre to compare the rap genre to I will show that rap is not only assumed to be political because of its origin, but proved to be so.","['Corpus linguistics', 'keyword', 'rap lyrics', 'politics']"

Het feit dat Cicero zo’n onverdeeld positief werk over Cato geschreven heeft lijkt moeilijk te rijmen met de afwisselend kritische en bewonderende beschrijvingen van Cato in zijn brieven. In mijn scriptie onderzoek ik dan ook waar Cicero’s kritiek en zijn bewondering op zijn gebaseerd en probeer ik op basis daarvan te verklaren waarom hij, ondanks zijn kritiek, een laudatio op Cato heeft geschreven. In zijn brieven toont Cicero vooral bewondering voor de eigenschappen van Cato die hij noodzakelijk achtte voor een goede staatsman en republikein. Dit waren deugden waarover Cicero zelf in mindere mate beschikte dan Cato. Tegelijkertijd bekritiseert hij Cato om diens rigide toepassing van stoïsche principes in de politiek en zijn gebrek aan politiek inzicht. Omdat het Cato daarmee ontbrak aan eigenschappen die Cicero juist weer wel bezat, zou de ideale republikein een “Cato” met een beetje “Cicero” zijn. Ik betoog dan ook dat Cicero’s 'Cato' enerzijds kan worden beschouwd als een voorschrift voor hoe je een goede republikein à la Cato kunt zijn en anderzijds een performatief geschrift is waarmee Cicero, bewust of onbewust, laat zien in hoeverre Cato moet worden nagevolgd.","['Cato Uticensis', 'de Cato', 'Cicero', 'exemplum', 'deugden', 'performatief', 'epistulae', 'kritiek', 'bewondering', 'voorschrift']"

Analyzing the stories requested of the students, the author evidences the components of the dynamics of self-representation, while describing essential elements of the context in which this phenomenon occurs: center-periphery, inclusion-exclusion, Latin America as Edenic vision and Holland as a Desired destination. In this sense, an important contribution is the description of the Netherlands and its functioning as a recipient country based on a critical interpretation of the stories of the interviewees. The image that emerges reveals the Dutch Academy as a space different from the one originally destined from the migrant imaginary. In the work on the dynamics of adaptation, it has also investigated the role played by the social spaces (e.g. student associations) of whose role and contribution in the construction of the feeling of community this work leaves record. Important is the fact that the student's reflection combines a topic of current debate -as the presence of international students- and a little-studied area: that of their cultural practices and their peculiar dynamics in the course of their adaptation process. At the same time, it records the way in which these processes, which take place in the West, generate modifications in the way of conceiving, seeing or projecting for the future of the students upon their return to Latin America. An innovative thesis not only in the subject but in the original application of the theoretical body and above all in the declared intention to participate, from the Academy, in the social debate.","['International Students', 'Dutch universities', 'Latinos', 'Imaginary of space', 'High skilled migrants', 'Knowledge economy', 'Cultural Analysis']"

Taking a quantitative approach, several distinct text-mining techniques are applied to political speech transcripts and newspaper opinion pieces of pro-independence and pro-union elites in order to identify broad lexical patterns in discourse. These results are then interpreted with the guidance of previous literature and within the theoretical framework of discursive institutionalism. The analysis finds that the most salient patterns are a pro-union emphasis on law and the constitution, and a pro-independence focus on the symbolic imagery produced by the referendum, such as polling stations, ballot boxes, and police violence. The results also find differing representations of the relationship between Catalonia and Spain, and to a lesser degree, the role of Europe within the dynamic. Taken together, these findings illuminate broad discursive strategies employed by both sides of the independence debate as they seek to either provoke or prevent institutional change.","['Catalonia', 'Spain', 'referendum', 'Independence', 'text mining', 'Puigdemont', 'nationalism', 'sub-state', 'content analysis', 'discursive institutionalism']"

Voice assimilation: The case of Greek /s/-voicing and the phonetics-phonology interface,"Dimos, Kostis","['Oostendorp, Mark van', 'Heuven, Vincent van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Assimilation phenomena often attract phonologists’ interest, as they are common in every language. However, various assimilation phenomena remain unstudied, especially in terms of experimental phonology and phonetics. One of the most common cases is /s/-voicing in Standard Modern Greek (SMG), i.e. the conversion of a voiceless [s] to a voiced /z/ when followed by a voiced consonant as a result of regressive voice assimilation. Most of the previous research indicates variability across speakers and across different types of consonants. Overall, the realization of /s/-voicing is described as gradient rather than categorical. Previous studies have only focused on /s/-voicing across word boundaries. However, /s/-voicing also occurs within the boundaries of a word. In many cases, clusters containing a sibilant and a voiced consonant are formed by morphological processes. This study aims to investigate the /s/-voicing across word boundaries, morpheme boundaries, and stem internally in order to describe the application of /s/-voicing in SMG in different morphological environments. For the goals of this study, native speakers of SMG were recorded during a production experiment. The speakers read aloud a number of passages designed to contain different cases of /s/-voicing. Various acoustic correlates were examined in order to describe the tokens phonetically and compare the assimilated tokens with the sibilant phonemes /s/ and /z/ of SMG. The applicaiton of voicing was measured as the ratio of the voiced part of over the total duration of the sibilant. The different morphological boundaries did not seem to clearly affect the application of /s/-voicing. However, the voicing ratio differs across the different types of following consonants as well as across speakers. These results confirm the previous literature in regard to the effect of the following consonant and between-speaker variability. The center of gravity was the most distinctive characteristic between assimilated and non-assimilated tokens and differences in terms of duration and intensity were found between the non-assimilated and [s] tokens as well as between assimilated and [z] tokens.","['Greek', 'Phonetics', 'Phonology', 'Voicing Assimilation']"
The Transitioning Image of Western Art in Taiwanese eyes: a case study of the Chimei Museum,"HSU, Yu-Han","['Boers, M.E.W.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The purpose of this thesis is to examine the image of Western art in Taiwan with a focus on the Chimei Museum (*1990). Motivated by the recent trend for acquiring and displaying Western works of art in East Asia, I concentrate on the Taiwanese response in an attempt to bridge academic gaps in interpreting how East Asia reacts to Western culture. On the one hand, Taiwanese art collecting and exhibiting has definitely mirrored the cultural environment in East Asia as it was one of the earliest international art markets in post-war East Asia (*1945). On the other hand, having been colonized by the Japanese who introduced their westernization strategies (1895-1945) and then with a fresh injection of Chinese culture as the seat of the Republic of China (*1945, post-war period), the Taiwanese public’s impression of Western art provides a copybook example of how the Western aesthetics were constructed under Japanese, Chinese and local Taiwanese rules. The Chimei Museum is an exemplification of the introduction of Western art in modern Taiwan. As a private museum, the educational background of its founder, Xu Wen Long (許文龍, *1928), who was brought up under Japanese rule, marks the initial point of entry of Western aesthetics into the colonized society. During her directorship of the Chimei Museum in the late 1990s, Xu’s successor, Kuo Ling Ling (郭玲玲, *1956), has shown a new attitude toward appreciating Western art in post-war Taiwan. Taking the perspectives of collecting and museum culture as the starting point, my analysis of the Chimei Museum hopes to provide a pioneering discussion about the general Taiwanese reception of Western art.","['Reception of Western Art', 'Chimei Museum']"

To its most simple definition, the Belt and Road initiative intends to encourage global trade and interconnectedness between Eurasia and China through various infrastructure projects. From building ports in Bangladesh and Pakistan, to constructing High-Speed railway lines in Thailand or Vietnam, the Chinese government has also been increasingly involved on European continent. As one of China’s biggest trading partners, Germany has become an important part of the new Silk Road. In the center of that development lays Duisburg.

Moreover, Duisburg is regarded as the official start/end of the land based silk road rail corridor. However, German responses to the Belt and Road have been multifaceted to say the least. Policy makers at the subnational and national level have different ideas and priorities on how to tackle the BRI. Therefore, this thesis will apply Putnam's game theory framework in order to explain the German two level policymaking situation through a case study. This thesis will determine who the relevant subnational actors are and analyze their policy preferences. Consequently, the interrelationship between subnational actors and national actors at the federal level will be explored. As a result this thesis argues that the discrepancy between the two levels led Germany to balance a thin line between principled openness and targeted protection.","['One Belt One Road', 'Sino-German relations', 'Belt and Road initiative', 'Two level game']"

The China Threat in the Wall Street Journal: 2016-2018,"Elen, Jan Maurits Nicolas","[""d'Hooghe, Ingrid""]",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Bilateral relations between the United States and China have increasingly soured since President Donald Trump assumed office in 2017. A key reason is that China’s growing power has made it a threat to U.S. hegemony and the U.S. is more proactively seeking to contain China than ever before. While China’s threat can be examined from various theoretical angles, such as realism, few studies have looked at it from the perspective of the U.S. media. This is an important avenue for research as perceptions influence international relations and the media plays an important role in shaping such perceptions. Conversely, the media reflects tendencies in politics and society. Using content analysis, the portrayal of the China threat in the news coverage of the Wall Street Journal is examined between 2016 and 2018. The debate on the China threat has mostly consisted of three categories, namely military, economic, and political. The thesis adds a new category to be used in content analysis, namely world order.","['China', 'threat', 'content analysis', 'media', 'US-China relations']"

Populism and Language: A Linguistic Trend in Populist Discourse,"El-Masoudi, Hamza","['Jeffery, Jill']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Throughout the years populism has managed to take many forms. While not entirely a western phenomenon, with many prominent examples existing in Latin America and some in Africa, many of the most noteworthy examples were established in Western Europe. In more recent years this has taken shape in the form of parties led by people such as Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders, Nigel Farage, and Pablo Iglesias. This resurgence is a relatively long time coming. Cas Mudde has warned for years that “populist discourse has become mainstream in the politics of western democracies” calling it a “populist zeitgeist” (2004). Recently, Donald Trump has become one of the most successful and most of all surprising examples of mainstream populism, but how does his language use differ from those before him? Many of populism’s core principles have managed to stay the same, while others have changed and adapted throughout the years depending on its leaders, the people it is directed to, and the political climate it is being implemented in. This paper will analyse the language aspect of two major populist figures of our time, namely Donald J. Trump and Nigel Farage. It will compare and contrast their use of language using rhetorical and register analysis, based on parameters founded in political discourse analysis. This paper will provide clear examples to illustrate these similarities and differences in rhetoric and style, and aims to establish a relationship between linguistic features and populist rhetoric.","['Populism', 'Linguistics', 'Trump', 'Farage']"

Battle of the Classics: A study on the explanatory power of Neofunctionalist and Liberal Intergovernmentalist theory in regards to the unexploited potential of the Single Market.,"Sluijs, Laurens van der","['Keulen, Mendeltje van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Theories on European integration postulate what actors, processes and developments are central to the construction and functioning of the EU. Therefore, such theorization of integration can be used to explain, clarify and justify specific events. This thesis draws on the authentic arguments and assumptions of Neofunctionalism and Liberal Intergovernmentalism, i.e. two classic integration theories, to test their explanatory power by means of a case study. The context in which this study takes place is the completion of the Single Market, the barriers thereto and the subsequent potential of the Single Market that is left unexploited. One such barrier is the existence of different corporate tax regimes in and across the Single Market. The case used in this study is the proposed legislation on a Common (Consolidated) Corporate Tax Base (C(C)CTB), which is aimed at addressing this issue and to eliminate the negative consequences of tax regime disparities. The research question that guides this thesis is as follows: ‘to what extent can Neofunctionalist and/or Liberal Intergovernmentalist theory explain the proposed legislation on a Common (Consolidated) Corporate Tax Base and associated processes and developments?’ In pursuance of rejecting the null hypothesis and supporting one of the three alternative hypotheses, this study derived six ‘expectations’ from both integration theories to assess their compatibility with what can be observed in practice. Subsequently, the theory with the most accurate presumptions, measured by the degree of compliance, is assumed to hold most explanatory power and, consequently, ‘wins this battle’. The data used for this study is composed of desk and field research, including but not limited to interviews with the European Commission, KPMG EU Tax Centre and the Permanent Representation of the Netherlands in Brussels. With an average score of 4.2 against 2.2 (on a five-point scale), the outcome of the data analysis clearly indicates that the expectations derived from Neofunctionalist theory are significantly better capable of explaining relevant processes and developments underlying the C(C)CTB. Therefore, this study concludes that Neofunctionalism in this case holds more explanatory power than Liberal Intergovernmentalism. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that due to low external validity the results of this study cannot or to a very limited extent be generalized to other situations. Accordingly, further research, for which this thesis could provide a methodological blueprint, is required to assess the explanatory power of both integration theories in regards to other issues that constitute barriers to the Single Market. Thereafter, it may be verified whether the findings presented in this study do indeed hold and are as such applicable to the broader context in which this study is situated.","['European Integration', 'Laurens van der Sluijs', 'Corporate Taxation', 'Neofunctionalism', 'Liberal Intergovernmentalism', 'Case Study', 'Theory testing']"
"Global IR(evolution): Language, Political Economy, and Problems Going Forward for Global IR","Van Els, Thomas","['Koyama, Hitomi']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The aim of this thesis is to problematize Amitav Acharya’s Global International Relations framework, demonstrate problems with IR’s reliance on the English language, as well as IR’s political economy, and show how these three factors may impede the development and incorporation of Global IR in modern IR overall. The first argument that this thesis presents is a problematization of the emphasis on English within IR, and it will do so over the first two chapters. The first chapter of the thesis tackles with the use of English in the contemporary international climate, where, as Bunce et al. and Kubota & Okuda demonstrate how English shapes and intervenes in international politics and developments. The second chapter, which will look at the state of the English language in IR theory, demonstrates that English is tied closely together with the legitimacy of IR as an academic discipline as well as in the imagining of globalisation, and how it has shaped the creation of the Us vs. Them dichotomy that encounters so much criticism within IR. The second argument, which will be approached in Chapter 3, will turn to the political economy of IR, and how this has helped in the creation of the homogenous academic field we work in today. By looking at the development of the university as an institution for research through Kamola’s argument, the presence of the publish or perish culture, and the problems that this, combined with the English-dominated Western IR, present for the globalising of IR - one of the mission statements of Global IR. This thesis will conclude by suggesting a potential alternative approach that Global IR can look into to tackle the issues that are presented throughout the thesis.","['Global IR', 'Language', 'Political Economy', 'Language Myth', 'Linguistic Turn', 'Translation', 'Loss of meaning']"

As a vital part of CPEC, Pakistan plays a momentous role whose attitudes are worthy to be delved. According to the exploration of Pakistani official websites, think tank, individuals, media,academic circle and network forums, attitudes toward CPEC can be divided into active support, discreet neutrality and vigilant opposition. Authority,individuals and main think tank call for a wholehearted backing for the great significance of CPEC to Pakistan while English and Urdu media and academic area carefully maintain neutrality and some of the Pakistani network forums perceive CPEC to be futile. China should be answerable to the situation mentioned above by taking effective steps of deepening all-round cooperation, promoting China-Pakistan media communication, refuting false statements etc.","[""Pakistan's position"", 'CPEC']"
Verstedelijking versus burgerveiligheid. De effecten van het verstedelijkingsproces van El Alto ten opzichte van burgerveiligheid en de rol van burgerparticipatie,"Geerse, Iddo","['Valdivia Rivera, Soledad']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Latijns-Amerikastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie staat de verstedelijking van de stad El Alto centraal. Op dit moment is El Alto de snelst groeiende stad van Bolivia. Het is de op één na grootste stad van het land geworden en is tweemaal zo hard gegroeid als verwacht. Dit komt door twee grote migratiegolven die in de twintigste eeuw hebben plaatsgevonden en door de huidige economische status van El Alto. Vanwege de explosieve stedelijke bevolkingsgroei zijn de criminaliteitscijfers van de stad gestegen en heerst er vandaag de dag een gevoel van onveiligheid onder de burgers in El Alto. In dit onderzoek zullen de effecten die het verstedelijkingsproces van El Alto heeft gehad ten opzichte van burgerveiligheid in kaart worden gebracht. Daarnaast zal in dit onderzoek worden gekeken naar de rol die burgerparticipatie heeft gespeeld met betrekking tot burgerveiligheid binnen El Alto. Het analyseren van het verstedelijkingsproces van El Alto is om meerdere redenen relevant. Ten eerste is het van belang om te analyseren wat voor invloed verstedelijking heeft op burgerveiligheid binnen zo’n snelgroeiende stad. Een interessante kwestie is hierbij: op wat voor manier kan de veiligheid van burgers in een snel urbaniserende stad als El Alto gewaarborgd blijven? Deze analyse zou in de toekomst kunnen worden toegepast op gelijksoortige steden in de Latijns-Amerikaanse regio, die met eenzelfde stedelijke groei te maken hebben. Inderdaad, Latijns-Amerika geldt als een regio met een zeer snelgroeiende urbane populatie, en loopt daarbij voorop in de globale trend van verstedelijking. In het jaar 2050 wordt verwacht dat 86% van Latijns-Amerika verstedelijkt is. Daarnaast is het relevant om te onderzoeken of de opkomst van burgerparticipatie heeft bijgedragen aan de burgerveiligheid binnen de stad. Binnen de regio, is de burgerveiligheid in de afgelopen decennia namelijk enorm verslechterd vanwege toegenomen criminaliteit en geweldsmisdrijven, daarom is het relevant om onderzoek te doen rondom de burgerveiligheidsproblematiek die heerst in LatijnsAmerika. Hierbij is het van belang om voor deze scriptie te analyseren of de burgers van El Alto een positieve rol spelen in de bestrijding van burgeronveiligheid. De onderzoeksvraag van deze scriptie is: Wat voor invloed heeft verstedelijking gehad op burgerveiligheid in El Alto, en wat voor rol speelt burgerparticipatie met betrekking tot burgerveiligheid binnen El Alto? Hierbij is de hypothese als volgt geformuleerd: De verstedelijking van El Alto heeft een slechte invloed gehad op burgerveiligheid en burgerparticipatie heeft op een positieve manier bijgedragen aan de burgerveiligheid binnen El Alto. Voor de goede structurering van deze scriptie, is deze opgedeeld in drie hoofdstukken. Het eerste hoofdstuk is het theoretisch kader, waar de concepten verstedelijking, burgerveiligheid en burgerparticipatie besproken zullen worden. In het tweede hoofdstuk zal de problematiek van de concepten die in deze scriptie centraal staan worden geanalyseerd. Hierbij zal de problematiek van deze concepten op drie verschillende niveaus worden gecontextualiseerd. Allereerst op regionaal niveau aangaande de regio Latijns-Amerika, daarna op nationaal niveau waarbij de nadruk ligt op Boliviaanse steden en tot slot op plaatselijk niveau waarin de casestudy van deze scriptie centraal staat, namelijk El Alto. Het laatste hoofdstuk zal gaan over de rol die 5 burgerparticipatie speelt met betrekking tot de burgerveiligheidsproblematiek van El Alto. Allereerst zal worden beschreven wat burgerorganisaties in de praktijk doen met betrekking tot burgeronveiligheid. Daarna zullen de effecten en resultaten van deze vorm van burgerparticipatie worden besproken. Tot slot zal er worden gekeken naar de oplossingen die door burgers worden aangedragen met betrekking tot burgerveiligheid en hoe deze in relatie staan tot de burgerveiligheidsproblematiek in El Alto. Tenslotte zal er in de conclusie een antwoord worden gegeven op de onderzoeksvraag.","['Verstedelijking', 'Burgerveiligheid', 'Burgerparticipatie', 'Juntas Vecinales', 'Criminaliteit']"
"Living with the legacy of displacement: An exploration of non-return and the long-term effects of displacement on social life in Pabo, northern Uganda","Kwaks, Juul","['Walraven, Klaas van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"War ravaged northern Uganda for over two decades after its start in 1986. During this time, over 80% of the Acholi population living there was internally displaced. This occurrence has disrupted social life in more ways than often acknowledged in policy-making and discourse surrounding displacement. This thesis draws focus to personal experiences of people who moved to Pabo – the former site of one of the displacement camps – during the war, and who have not left this place since. Using data from life histories collected in Pabo during seven months of fieldwork, it explores motivations for non-return and shows that displacement is more than a forced move from one geographical location to another; it involves economic, social, and cosmological considerations and touches upon identity and belonging. This thesis also explores the long-term effects of displacement on life by zooming in on social relations within the household. Using the concept of anomie, it is argued that, in this particular post-conflict context, there is lessened social guidance on desirable goals and accepted behavior as well as a discrepancy between goals that are still valued and the means available to achieve them. Building upon the life histories, the argument is constructed that the situation of anomie has contributed to intergenerational friction and to families breaking up. The goal of this thesis is to lay bare the interface between structure and agency, and to counter the trend of turning internally displaced people as well as refugees into abbreviations and subjects without a voice.","['internal displacement', 'Uganda', 'Pabo', 'IDP camp', 'anomie', 'non-return', 'masculinity', 'gender relations', 'land conflict', 'life histories']"

Trump in Translation: American Political Jargon and Terminology in Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury and Their Translation from English to Dutch,"Stuurwold, Maud","['Zeven, Katinka']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"With all the media attention that has been going out to the American presidential election and the Trump administration, newspapers and TV broadcasters in the Netherlands repeatedly come across language related to the political media circus surrounding Donald Trump. For concepts that are culturally and politically specific to the U.S., a translator would need to possess a certain cultural and historical understanding of the source culture, as there is ultimately no preferred model for translating political terminology and jargon. Therefore, this thesis analyses the Dutch translations of political terminology and words uniquely related to Trump (i.e. Trumpisms) in Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House and its official Dutch translation, Vuur en Woede: In het Witte Huis van Trump. By using Pedersen’s taxonomy of translation strategies and Mark and McCutcheon’s six political language categories, the results of the case study show that most findings (total: 862) belong to the categories ‘Terminology’ (269), ‘Personalities’ (134), and ‘Expressions’ (182). The Dutch translators adhered to both a source-oriented and a target oriented approach, making use of generalisations (target-oriented, 22,66%), direct translations (source-oriented, 21,86%), retentions (source-oriented, 18,12%), and cultural substitutions (target-oriented, 12,98%). As generalisation was the most common strategy, one could argue that to convey the meaning of a word or phrase was ultimately more important than preserving its original form. This also applies to the direct translations, as the translators preferred to use these literal or close to word-for-word translations when a generalisation was deemed too neutral or simplistic. Retentions and cultural substitutions filled the gaps when both direct translations and generalisations were not appropriate. Through this, Fire and Fury’s Dutch translation preserved some of its original American subtexts.","['Trump', 'jargon', 'politics', 'terminology', 'Fire and Fury', 'Literary Translation', 'Non-fiction']"

Baudet gaat voor iets Wilders: Hoe grammaticale kenmerken van speeches van Baudet laten zien dat hij toch echt een man van het volk is,"Hoogenband, Fenne van den","['Jungslager, Francisca']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Taal beïnvloedt de manier waarop wij naar de werkelijkheid kijken en roept oordelen en associaties op. Om deze reden is taal een belangrijk middel voor politici: zij kunnen taal inzetten voor hun eigen succes. Zeer succesvolle politici van de laatste jaren zijn die met een populistische inslag. In dit onderzoek komen taal en populisme samen, in de vorm van een analyse van de grammaticale kenmerken van speeches van Baudet, een nieuwe politicus in de Tweede Kamer en tevens een zogenaamde populist. Ter introductie van het begrip populisme wordt allereerst getracht dit zeer brede begrip iets meer vorm te geven, waaruit zal blijken dat er twee duidelijke kernwaarden zijn: de populist zegt voor het volk te spreken en stelt dat volk centraal, en de populist presenteert zich als anti-elitair. Een derde kenmerk dat belangrijk is, zeker ook in het geval van Baudet, is dat de populist een specifieke groep van de samenleving probeert uit te sluiten. Na afbakening van dit begrip wordt overgestapt naar de taal van de populist, want bestaat er eigenlijk wel zoiets als populistisch taalgebruik? Uit de onderzoeken die besproken worden zal blijken dat er inderdaad sprake is van terugkerende, talige elementen, maar dat deze wel voornamelijk gebaseerd zijn op de taal van Wilders, en deels de taal van Trump, zeker wanneer het grammatica betreft, want hierover is nog niet veel geschreven. Dit is een nadeel van dit onderzoek, maar maakt dit onderzoek tegelijkertijd des te interessanter, want de resultaten laten zien dat een onderzoek naar grammaticale elementen zeker vruchtbaar kan zijn. De speeches van Baudet werden geanalyseerd op basis van een zelf samengestelde, grammaticale checklist, waarin voornamelijk grammaticale elementen voorkwamen die interessant waren gebleken voor Wilders. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat Baudet graag spreekt in vrij korte zinnen, die vaak een retorische vraag vormen, weinig bijzinnen bevatten, juist veel (lange) parallellismen laten zien en weinig complementatie. Deze grammaticale kenmerken werden ook voor Wilders gevonden in eerdere onderzoeken, en houden verband met verschillende eigenschappen van taal, zoals de begrijpelijkheid ervan, overtuigingskracht en feitelijkheid. Deze eigenschappen van taal laten zien dat Baudet, ondanks zijn elitaire uitstraling, de taal van het volk spreekt, zoals goed past binnen het straatje van de populist: wanneer je inhoudelijk stelt voor het volk te spreken, moet de bijbehorende taal begrijpelijk en helder zijn voor dat volk, en dus niet elitair. Bij eventueel vervolgonderzoek zou gekeken kunnen worden naar de grammatica van andere politici, zowel populistisch als niet populistisch, en zou er een groter corpus voor Baudet bij de studie betrokken kunnen worden.","['populisme', 'politiek taalgebruik', 'grammatica']"

"Refugees and Representation: Navigating Ethics, Politics and Hospitality in Contemporary Narratives of Forced Displacement","Moulding, Keira","['Ieven, Bram Koen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Current prevalent representations of displacement are ubiquitous and often deeply shocking. Previous studies of refugee representation have focused on the polarisation of pro/anti-refugee narratives and highlighted patterns in their depiction at opposite poles (in humanitarian and media/political discourses). However, new methods and mediums for representation indicate the evolution of a third discourse which this thesis identifies. At once material, ethical, political and representational, the current crisis of forced migration demands response beyond the reach of governments, intergovernmental and humanitarian organisations. In looking to narrative to enhance our understanding of the contemporary ‘crisis’, cultural representations find new ways of responding to displacement and hosting— without which the debate cannot be advanced. This paper testifies to one strand of cultural engagement with forced migration by focusing on four narratives published since 2015. Reading across genres from fiction to life-stories to journalistic literature and theatre, this thesis examines new discursive approaches to refugee representation in Patrick Kingsley’s The New Odyssey, collaborative refugee writing projects, Voices from the ‘Jungle’ and Shatila Stories, and Joe Robertson and Joe Murphy’s play The Jungle.","['Refugees', 'Representation', 'displacement', 'media', 'fiction', 'discourse', 'non-fiction', 'migrants', 'ethics', 'Europe']"

Zending en kolonialisme in de negentiende eeuw,"Hartog, Adriaan den","['Schrikker, Alicia']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Volgens Tony Ballantyne heeft het christendom een betwiste maar belangrijke plaats in het hart van het Britse imperium en de imperiale cultuur. In een essay over de Britse kolonisatie van Nieuw Zeeland concludeert Ballantyne dat die kolonisatie gepresenteerd werd als een vorm van humanitaire interventie, ingegeven door morele en politieke motieven en retoriek van de zending. Dit relatief nieuwe perspectief op kolonialisme is voor het Nederlands kolonialisme nog niet in toegepast in onderzoek. Dit onderzoek is een eerste stap in die richting. Aan de hand van het tijdschrift van het Nederlandsch Zendelinggenootschap is onderzocht hoe zendelingen de zending en het kolonialisme rechtvaardigden naar de achterban toe, in de jaren ’30 van de negentiende eeuw, vergeleken met de jaren ’80 van de negentiende eeuw. Het onderzoek neemt ook plaats in het bredere historiografische debat over New Imperial History, door juist geen politiek, bestuurlijk of militair perspectief te nemen. Het eerste hoofdstuk focust op de context waarin het NZG opereerde en hoe het NZG zelf in elkaar zat. Daaruit blijkt dat de duale missie van het verspreiden van geloof en 'beschaving' al van het begin aanwezig was. In het tweede en derde hoofdstuk zijn per periode verschillende thema's uitgewerkt. Voor de jaren dertig zijn dat werving en ideaalbeeld van zendelingen, ziekte en overlijden en interactie met de lokale bevolking. De thema's van de jaren tachtig zijn werving en ideaalbeeld van zendelingen, scholing en financiële oproepen. De analyses van deze onderwerpen in de maandberichten demonstreren dat het NZG een retoriek toepaste in de maandberichten die continu diende om in de eerste plaats de zending te rechtvaardigen. In de tweede plaats lag de nadruk op het belang van 'ontwikkeling en beschaving' van de lokale volkeren. Deze argumentatie zorgde onder andere voor het oprichten van scholen die later werden overgenomen door de Nederlandse overheid. Deze scholen waren een teken van de aanloop naar de Ethische Politiek.","['Zending', 'Kolonialisme', 'Religie', 'New Imperial History', 'Negentiende eeuw', 'Nederlandsch Zendelinggenootschap', 'NZG', 'Maandberigten']"

A comparison between the depiction of leftover women in the media to leftover women's self-portrayals in the PRC,"Lu, Miaomiao","['Kharchenkova, Svetlana']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The prevalent phenomena of ""leftover women"" has gained increasing attention from the media and different scholars in Chinese society. The term ""leftover women"" refers to urban and professional women who remain unmarried by the time they are in their late twenties or early thirties. This phenomena frequently addresses questions pertaining to why such working women are not married, whether they are willing to marry and their attitudes towards marriage. The Chinese media has also produced many dramatic television series reflecting the situation and marital prospects of leftover women. Within the media, these women are stigmatised as money-worshipers, snobbish or picky. However, it has become evident that leftover women present themselves online as economically and spiritually independent entities who prefer compatibility over financial security in their romantic relationships. Upon comparing depictions of such women in the media to their self-representations, this paper makes a twofold argument: on one hand, media representations controlled by the dominant male discourse are criticising women for being money-oriented and picky so they become losers in the marriage market.

Understanding Inadequate Climate Change Governance: A Neo-Gramscian Discourse Analysis,"Hendriks, Eefje","['Valk, John-Harmen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis engaged with the research question: How do multilateral institutions, fossil fuel companies and environmental nongovernmental organisations attempt to fixate meaning in climate change discourse to steer international climate change governance? The analysis reveals that governments and the fossil fuel industry problematise climate change as a challenge of decarbonising society, which can be achieved with technological and economic solutions. The climate change challenge is depoliticised, because this strategy enables the root cause of climate change, the fossil fuel-based energy chain, to be left intact. By articulating this strategy in the context of justice and responsibility, social consent is generated and the hegemonic position of states and the fossil fuel industry is safeguarded. ENGOs attempt to re-politicise the climate change problem by articulating it as an opportunity for systemic social change and trying to break social consent for the hegemonic bloc. Their strategies for influencing and steering governance, however, are limited as a result of structural constraints. This demonstrates the hegemonic position of states and the fossil fuel industry.","['Climate change', 'Discourse Analysis', 'Neo-Gramscian Discourse Theory']"

Ideophones make up a large and productive word class in Zulu, as they do in most Bantu languages (Nkabinde, 1986; Doke & Vilakazi, 1951). However, a study by Childs (1996) found that ideophone knowledge and use is in decline among young Zulu speakers in South Africa, likely because of influence from Afrikaans and English as prestige languages which do not have ideophones. This study seeks to follow up on this and expand upon it with the inclusion of gestures and an investigation of the attitudes surrounding ideophone use. The central finding is that the results here conform to Childs’s (1996) prediction that ideophone use is decreasing among Zulu speakers; however, ideophones are generally positively perceived by urban speakers, which stands in stark contrast to what Childs (1996) found. The implications of these positive attitudes are discussed in light of South Africa’s sociolinguistic history and current context. Lastly, I posit the tentative hypothesis that many of the functions of ideophones have persisted into urban Zulu in the form of onomatopoeia and even code-switching.","['ideophones', 'zulu', 'south africa', 'gestures', 'language contact', 'expressive', 'sociolinguistics']"
Perceiving Elizabeth I in French diplomatic correspondence (1568-1584),"Torre, Lisa van der","['Duindam, Jeroen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The thesis examines the correspondence of Bertrand de Salignac de la Motte-Fénélon (156875) and Michel de Castelnau, seigneur de la Mauvissière (1575-1585). From their correspondence two themes stand central, namely Elizabeth as a woman and Elizabeth as a ruler. In contrary to other works, the individuality of both ambassadors is discussed and the differences and similarities between ambassadors are presented. This thesis will argue that Elizabeth’s gender has been overplayed in her historiography. While gender is mentioned, it does not take a prominent role in the ambassadorial dispatches of Fénélon and Mauvissière. Furthermore, Fénélon and Mauvissière recognised Elizabeth’s usage of her gender in political situations and reported this to the French royal family. Additionally, Fénélon and Mauvissière had different views on Elizabeth’s rule. For instance, both ambassadors did not perceive Elizabeth as indecisive, but recognised her procrastination as a political tool. Moreover, Fénélon and Mauvissière were aware of the influence of Elizabeth’s members, but knew that the queen held the final say in political decisions. Lastly, while Fénélon acknowledged the significance of Elizabeth’s ladiesin-waiting, Mauvissière did not mention the ladies once, which illustrates the difference between the ambassadors.",['Elizabeth I gender French diplomatic correspondence']
The Soft Approach,"Scheffer, Nathalie","['Regilme Jr., Salvador']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Public diplomacy is a relatively new tool in foreign relations and the United States was late to the table when it came to using it. This thesis aims to investigate the public diplomacy tools deployed by the Bush administration during the War on Terror. Through performing a critical discourse analysis and focussing on Afghanistan and Iraq specifically, it answers the questions: What were the core objectives for the Bush Administration to start and continue the War on Terror? How were tools of public diplomacy deployed to reach these objectives? And which values were the most prevalent in this? It was found that the core objectives for the War on Terror were self-defense and the protection and promotion of human rights. In order to reach these objectives, the Bush administration used speeches and educational programs as a tool to spread their message abroad. Moreover, the values that drove the public diplomacy campaign were democracy and freedom, which have both been at the core of American society for centuries. Further research on the topic should focus on the reception of the tools by the Arab population and determine the effectiveness of public diplomacy by the Bush administration.","['Public diplomacy', 'United States', 'Middle East', 'international relations', 'war on terror']"

While this movement consisted mostly of men, there were also female Beatniks. Because these female Beatniks faced marginalization and alienation from within the Beat movement, as well as in traditional society, I will argue that they became more socially aware and driven to rebellion against conformity than their male counterparts, which makes these women the true embodiments of the ideals and actions of the Beat generation. Since the scope of this thesis does will not allow for extensive research on a range of Beat women, this thesis will explore the lives and works of two important female Beatniks; Diane di Prima (1934) and Hettie Jones (1934). By examining Di Prima’s and Jones’ literary output, the rebellion and marginalization found in their literary works can be put into historical context based on the examination of (auto)biographical texts.","['Greenwich Village', 'Beat', 'Beatnik', 'Diane di Prima', 'Hettie Jones', 'subculture']"
Obama's War on Terror: The emergence of Drone Warfare,"Groot, Tom de","['Regilme, Salvador']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Why did the use of drone strikes increase during the first term of the Obama administration? During his presidential campaign Barrack Obama called for a military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of torture and indefinite detention of suspected terrorists and the closing of Guantanamo Bay. For these reasons, many believed that Obama intended to end the War on Terror begun by the Bush administration after the attacks on 9/11. Contradicting this expectation, the number of US drone strikes used to counter terrorism increased drastically during Obama's first term as president. This research seeks to identify the causal factors for the proliferation of drone strikes by explaining how it fits into the broader context of the continuation of the War on Terror during Obama’s first term. Firstly, it is argued that Obama was trapped in the War on Terror. Secondly, it is argued that the use of drone strikes increased because the Obama administration sought to reduce public disapproval of War on Terror policies, while continuing war efforts.","['Obama administration', 'Drone warfare', 'Drones', 'Historical Institutionalism', 'War on terror']"

This thesis researches to what extent neoliberal ideology influenced changes to social welfare programs (AFDC) in the United States between 1992 and 1996. It is suggested that the change from AFDC to TANF happened in 1996 due to a combination of a sharp increase in welfare rolls and increasing poverty levels occurring consecutively, changing ideological motivations toward social welfare, and welfare experiments conducted under H.W. Bush proving successful. In 1992, Clinton promised to replace welfare with a comprehensive suite of programs to facilitate leaving welfare, but passed welfare reform in 1996 without generous provisions due to a belief in the independent functioning of the core provisions of the TANF law. TANF was different, because it introduced; flexibility in policy making, by devolving authority to states through block grants, negative incentives to leave welfare, through time limits on lifetime benefits and work requirements and increased accountability, by making states responsible for maintaining work participation rates. It is suggested that most major TANF provisions were consistent with a belief in market-efficiency, market-morality and monetarism and could therefore be linked to neoliberal ideology both by their execution and by the discourse surrounding their implementation.","['North America', 'Social Welfare', 'Neoliberalism', 'Welfare Reform']"

WHO CARES FOR LIBYAN SOVEREIGNTY? International and Local Drivers of Post-2011 Reconstruction of Libyan Statehood,"Al-Shadeedi, Al-Hamzeh","['Calculli, Marina']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The exposure of Libya’s political fragmentation and societal disintegration after 2011 was picked up by academics, journalists, and policy researchers who have written on that aspect of the Libyan reality more than any other. Libya is perceived as a fragile state with hundreds of armed groups, multiple claims of governance and tens of warring tribes. Both local and international actors have contributed to this image, but this thesis attempts to argue that there is more than the fragile and disorganized state discourse to describe Libya. The fact that Libyan unity, sovereignty, and independence have survived this extreme level of fragmentation is a question that deserves to be investigated. Thus, through the use of wide range of theories, academic and policy papers, news articles, survey data, and political agreements reports, this thesis aims to answer why and how Libya managed to preserve its status as a state in such an environment. It treats the question as a question of sovereignty by arguing that the traditional definition of sovereignty limits our ability to comprehend the state issue in Libya fully. By focusing on different aspects of sovereignty and by selecting broader definitions of the concept, this thesis argues that Libya’s unity and sovereignty have been preserved so far because international and local actors benefit from this arrangement even though they may be (in)directly contributing to fragmentation in the country. The international community is not willing to let states fall-apart, and the Libyan people do not seem to favor division and separation movements. Local state and non-state actors realize this arrangement, and they have not challenged thus far.","['Libya', 'Statehood', 'Sovereignty']"

This event is the publication of the Manifesto that Mou Zongsan 牟宗三, Tang Junyi唐君毅, Xu Fuguan 徐復觀, and Zhang Junmai 张君劢 co-signed and published almost simultaneously in the two journals Minzhu pinglun民評論 (Democratic Tribune) and Zaisheng再生(National Renaissance) with the title “为中国文化敬告世界人士宣言─我们对中国学术研究及中国文化与世界文前途之共同认识” (Wei Zhongguo wenhua jinggao shijie renshi xuanyan –women dui Zhongguo xueshu yanjiu ji Zhongguo wenhua yu shijiewen qiantu zhi gongtong renshi; translated in English as “A Manifesto on the Reappraisal of Chinese Culture – our Joint Understanding of the Sinological Study relating to World Cultural Outlook.”). Its main purpose is to benefit Western intellectuals in 'aiding them to appreciate Chinese culture'. In order to do so, the authors employ a strategic terminology, which allows them to build a consistent cross-cultural dialogue between Western and Chinese philosophy by means of an unprecedented discourse on 'Chinese Rationalism' (中国心性之学 Zhongguo xinxing zhi xue). Interestingly, the latter is described by the authors as “the essence of Chinese Culture” and, beside its comparative value, it represents the most comprehensive configuration of Confucianism in the context of 20th century. Academic interest in Chinese Studies and Chinese Philosophy should take into account the articulation of Chinese Rationalism in the Manifesto of 1958 as representing a paradigm of post-comparative dialogue that exemplifies the underlying philosophical continuity beyond consistently different traditions of thought.","['Confucianism', 'Rationalism', 'Comparative Philosophy', 'Manifesto', 'New Confucianism']"

Since 2011, the Syrian government has systematically blocked the United Nations from accessing populations in opposition-held areas. In theory, the Humanitarian Principles Neutrality and Independence provide the framework for gaining impartial access to conflict settings. Ironically, however, in practice the need to gain access has pushed the United Nations to compromise the Humanitarian Principles and comply to President Assad’s demands. While the United Nations’ compromises enable it to access at least government approved areas, these compromises have also facilitated Assad’s siege warfare tactic, population displacements and thereby re-shaped Syria’s socio-political landscape. Analysis of the Syrian conflict often focuses on President Assad’s role in perpetuating violence. Yet, the United Nations’ aid operation plays a similarly crucial role in shaping the dynamic and political outcome of the Syrian conflict. This paper therefore asks; To what extent has the United Nations adhered to the Humanitarian Principles Neutrality and Independence in its operations in the Syrian conflict between 2011 and 2017 and what are the implications?","['United Nations', 'Syria', 'Humanitarian Response', 'Siege', 'Forced Displacement', 'War Economy']"
Transcending Destiny in the Liezi 列子,"Lindenmann, Tanja","['Els, Paul van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Liezi is often regarded as the most important Daoist document after the Laozi and the Zhuangzi (both dating from the Warring States period; 475-221 BCE), yet the existing academic literature leaves a large gap on the philosophical significance of the Liezi, mainly because it is widely considered a forgery of the fourth or fifth century. Philosophically, the Liezi applies Daoist principles to human destiny by example of the Daoist sage, who despite his humanness, is said to be invulnerable. This is contrasted with ordinary people, who perceive their life as a series of fortunate and/or unfortunate events that either were happening as a result of their free will or were determined by forces beyond human control. Whereas for ordinary people free will and determinism are two separate entities, sages unify the manifestations of both concepts within themselves, realizing free will and determinism to be the same but two viewpoints on life which arise naturally due to the duality of existence. By examining the interrelationship between destiny and the sage based on its Daoist metaphysics, this study on the Liezi shows how the seemingly paradoxical relation between free will and determinism is reconciled in personal freedom and happiness through Daoist self-cultivation.","['Liezi', 'Destiny', 'Daoism', 'Xuanxue', 'Neo-Daoism', 'Philosophy', 'China']"

The Heart of the Superflat Spectacle: A Study on Anime Adaptation of Natsume Soseki's Kokoro,"Liang, Junchuan","['Mes, Thomas']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In post-Showa Japan, the expansion of literature into popular media forms, such as anime and manga, has accelerated due to development of media technology and, more importantly, rapid marketization. This phenomenon raises the questions of how exactly literature paves its path into the world of anime, and what is the sociocultural significance of this phenomenon in the context of contemporary (i.e. post-Showa) Japan. This thesis investigates Natsume Soseki’s Kokoro and its anime adaptation in 2009, episodes 7 and 8 in the anime series Aoi Bungaku (青い文学 meaning “blue literature”), to search for the connection between literature, popular culture and Japanese modernity. In the light of the methodology borrowed from contemporary adaptation studies, this thesis tries to answer two questions: 1) how is Natsume Soseki’s Kokoro adapted in Aoi Bungaku; 2) how can we interpret this adaptation in terms of changing Japanese society? Based on visual analysis of this adaptation, this thesis argues that the so-called contemporary Japanese visual “post-modernity” (for example, the “superflat” theory proposed by Takashi Murakami and Hiroki Azuma) is never a break from neither Meiji nor Western “modernity”. Rather, this “post-modernity” is built upon Meiji “modernity” with technological advancement and market expansion. The essence shared by this “modernity” and “post-modernity” is the capitalist mode of production.",

Since 2017, several actors in Lebanon actively facilitate and promote the repatriation of Syrians refugees. UNHCR stated that the requirements under international law for the United Nations to organise or encourage voluntary repatriation are not yet in place in Syria. However, UNHCR officers do meet with the returning refugees and are present at all current departure points of the returns facilitated by the Lebanese General Security based on the believe that people’s voluntary choice to return must be respected. This study examines the role of UNHCR in the Syrian repatriation process in Lebanon in order to understand how non-state actors operate vis-à-vis sovereign states and to give insight into the role of international organizations in world politics. The thesis is partly based on field research in Lebanon.","['UNHCR', 'Refugee repatriation', 'Syrian refugees', 'Lebanon']"

To what extent is China’s presence in Algeria neo-colonialist in nature or cohering in a wider economic development strategy?,"Bensaadi, Linda","['Wang, Jue']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The question of the negative Chinese impact in African countries needs to be discussed in wider terms than positive or negative. Indeed, Chinese investment and behavior in Africa have been questioned, as for instance about the trade imbalance in China’s favor, its impact on domestic markets and industrialization process and also the impact of its high competitiveness, which are seen as hurting African economies. Chinese goods dumped in African countries are highly price-competitive manufactured goods, and most of African economies have an underdeveloped industrial sector, therefore limiting their development and the possibility to compete on their domestic market. International trade should be based on the establishment of an order of equality and not the one of exploitation. A first superficial glance on Sino Algerian relations might give a negative, or pessimistic view of the relationship, yet a deeper analysis and the incorporation of an understanding of the Algerian officials’ behavior will allow for a more nuanced approach of the relationship.","['China', 'Africa', 'Global political economy', 'North Africa', 'Algeria', 'neo colonialsm', 'investment', 'trade', 'technological transfer']"

"The Relationship Between Western Europe and the Balkans: Past, Present and Future.","Mortiers, Eliane","['Weyenberg, A.L.B. van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The thesis analyses the effect of the ‘balkanism’ discourse, and the associated representations, on the relationship between Western Europe and the Balkans in late modern and contemporary history. The ‘balkanism’ discourse has been present for a long time and has strongly influenced Western European perceptions of the Balkan region in the 19th and 20th century. Due to the discourse, a certain distance had been created between the EU and the Balkans, in which the former named the latter the ‘other’ – mainly to indicate a cultural difference. The discourse and denigrating perceptions of the region, shaped over time, seem to be the main reason for the poor relationship between the EU and the Balkans in these two centuries. However, since the start of the 21st century, the EU has started to engage more with the region. In 2003, the first steps were taken to create stability and security in the EU and its neighbourhood by starting the integration process of the Western Balkans – that is, the remaining Balkan countries outside of the EU. The process includes several engagement and integration initiatives, compulsory accession criteria and (reform) programs in fields such as politics, economy and culture. Yet, the success of the integration process still remains to be seen. Apart from other issues related to the citizens’ opinions, the EU itself and the Balkan region, the historical perceptions still seem to influence this process as well. Hence, the effect of the ‘balkanism’ discourse and the associated representations seems to be significant, due to the fact that the discourse can be considered the key reason for the poor relationship of the past, and because it may still be affecting the relationship today.","['Western Europe', 'Balkans', 'Complicated Relationship', 'Balkanism', 'Yugoslav Wars', 'European Union', 'History', 'Present', 'Future', 'Initiatives', 'Exclusion versus Inclusion', 'Representations and Discourse']"

The Repercussions of the 1980s Sino-Tibetan Negotiations on the Tibetan Community,"Tengo, Rinchen Maha","['Black, Lindsay']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"1959 heralded an exodus of approximately one hundred thousand Tibetans who followed their leader, the Dalai Lama, into exile in India, following a failed uprising against the Chinese rule. Until 1978, there was no contact between the exile Tibetans and the Chinese government. During the 1980s, four rounds of talks were held between China and Tibet, which were eventually unfruitful. This thesis will explore the long term effects of these talks on the Tibetan diaspora, and analyse how the lack of agreement between the Tibetan and Chinese negotiating teams has led to the formation of two main political factions - one claiming Tibet’s right of independence and complete separation from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and another group advocating for greater power and more rights for Tibetans within the framework of the Chinese political system. This study contributes to the existing literature by delving into the archives and by providing insights from prominent Tibetans on the negotiations. It reveals that China’s main demand during the negotiations was the return of the Dalai Lama to the PRC, while the Tibetan side urged for the formation of a unified region of all the occupied Tibetan regions and increased freedom and rights for autonomy. It explores how the two parties were on different directions and had different leverages for the negotiations. The study concludes that there had never been any real attempts from the Chinese side to negotiate with the Tibetans. The Tibetan delegations, however, raised false hope among the Tibetan people, both inside and outside of Tibet.","['Sino-Tibet Negotiations', 'Repercussions', 'Genuine Autonomy', 'Middle Way Approach']"

Pipeline Politics: An analysis of the EU’s actorness in the case of the Southern Gas Corridor,"Korsman, Daphne","['Scepanovic, Vera']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The purpose of this thesis is to answer the question ‘to what extent can the EU act geopolitically in the context of energy security and should it?’ through the case study of the Southern Gas Corridor. The academic debate on the EU’s actorness in international politics has been ongoing and the unique structure of the EU seems to still puzzle scholars. This has especially been the case in the field of energy policy, as energy is a strategic and public good and thus subject to a geopolitical dimension. By analyzing previous research in the field of EU energy policy, four possible answers to the research question were found. These are that the EU can or cannot and that the EU should or should not act geopolitically in the context of energy security. The four answers make up the spine of this thesis and guides the research into finding that the EU can act geopolitically to a certain extent, but still lacks full-fletched policy tools due to the nature of the energy policy area, and should act geopolitically to advance its strategic energy security agenda. The EU is essentially no less geopolitical than other actors but attempts to hide this within its rule-based regulatory framework.","['European Union', 'Power', 'Energy Security', 'Energy Policy', 'The Southern Gas Corridor']"

Setsuwa zijn oraal overgeleverde verhalen, die op een gegeven moment zijn opgeschreven. Binnen het kader van het populaire canon waarin setsuwa op basis van hun populariteit en consensus opgenomen werden in de bundels, onderzoek ik de verandering waarbij Enma als entiteit verschillende reddende functies kreeg waardoor hij mensen na hun dood uit de Hellen kon redden. De setsuwa in de Konjaku Monogatarishū en de Uji Shūi Monogatari tonen aan dat Enma, afhankelijk van wie er voor hem kwam, zich vertoonde of als de rechter van de doden of als een reddende entiteit. In het merendeel van de circa twintig behandelde verhalen van de Konjaku Monogatarishū komen de reddende functies van Enma terug. Dit past binnen de ontwikkeling van zijn functie als goddelijke entiteit met reddende krachten. De functie van Enma als rechter verdwijnt niet, maar valt op de achtergrond. Tot slot zijn er in de Uji Shūi Monogatari twee setsuwa waarin Enma voorkomt. Hierbij wordt hij enerzijds gezien als een entiteit met reddende krachten, omdat hij wordt vereenzelvigd met de boddhisattva Jizō, en anderzijds als een rechter van de doden.","['Setsuwa', 'Enma', 'Konjaku Monogatarishū', 'Uji Shūi Monogatari']"
"A Transpacific Imagination: Japan, America and the Model Minority Myth","Ong, Chuan Ming","['Mark, Ethan']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Amid the ongoing controversy over Affirmative Action in the admissions policies of elite colleges in the US, the term “model minority,” and its implicit racial link with the Asian American community, has once again resurfaced in American national discourse. As such there is an increasing need to understand the Model Minority Myth in a wider, historical perspective. Drawing on Claire-Jean Kim’s racial triangulation theory, this thesis examines how Japanese American newspapers in California during the 1930s engaged in discursive self-essentialization, and dissociation from other non-white minorities as a means of survival in American society, and by doing so inadvertently contributed to the further perpetuation of a white-dominated racial hierarchy in the United States and a further solidification of the reputation of Asian Americans as an alleged Model Minority. It then critically analyzes the work of two contemporary Asian American authors known for their embrace of the Model Minority Identity, Amy Chua and Yukong Zhao, and demonstrates how the tactics they deploy in their works reiterate discursive strategies used by their Japanese American predecessors during the Depression Era. Rather than viewing model minority discourse as a strictly American phenomenon or a product of white American agency, this thesis argues for a wider, transnational lens with which we view patterns of discrimination across borders and time, taking into account conflict and compliance, action and reaction. In this way the thesis aims to contribute to an improved understanding of systems of discrimination and oppression and, more importantly, how to dismantle them.","['Model Minority', 'Japanese Americans', 'United States', 'West Coast', 'race', 'racialization', 'racism', 'transnational']"

The main question is, ‘How can handwritten Chinese characters be categorized in order to make unknown characters findable?’. Handwritten Chinese characters differ from regular or printed Chinese characters. Learning to read handwritten Chinese is not part of any university curriculum and it is usually not taught in language schools. There are only a few sources that can be used to find the corresponding regular form of an unknown handwritten character. Four sources are reviewed in order to explore and judge various methods. This research is based on the methods used in A Manual of Chinese Running-Hand Writing: Especially as it is Used in Japan written by Groeneveldt and De Saint Aulaire (1861), Dictionnaire des formes cursives des caractères chinois (1909) by Stanislas Millot, Sōsho Daijiten (1936) by Sukeyuki Endō and Chinese cursive script: An introduction to handwriting in Chinese (1958) by Fang-yü Wang.

Lastly, in Chapter 4 this paper gives a conclusion and discusses the limitations of this research and future research possibilities. Sky Castle can be seen as a dialogue with reality, highlighting specific social issues and can be seen as a way to open the discussion towards the current debate in Korea on the topic of status and education fever.

Debating Piety: Parvīn Iᶜtiṣāmī’s Innovation in the Genre of Munāẓara,"Noorian, Zhinia","['Seyed-Ghorab, Ali-Asghar']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The present study focuses on the novel features which Parvīn Iᶜtiṣāmī (1907-1941) introduced into the genre of munāẓara to utilize it as an influential platform to voice her criticism of the socio-political crisis in Iran. Parvīn Iᶜtiṣāmī, the prominent female Persian poet of the twentieth century, composed her poetry when Riżā Shāh Pahlavī (1878-1944) took control of Iran after the coup d’état of 1921. As a result of the political change, freedom of expression was curtailed more severely than before. She employed innovative strategies and techniques in the composition of “The Drunk and the Sober,” one of her popular munāẓaras, to express her reflections about the situation during the suffocating years of Riżā Shāh’s dictatorship. Relying on the classical Persian literature, she borrowed the recurrent themes, imagery and formal features such as rhyme scheme and radīf from antinomian poetry (qalandariyyāt). The poet employed the ambiguity and paradoxical features of qalandarī imagery. She masterfully introduced new elements into the munāẓara to incorporate her criticism of the contemporary situation. As a result, “The Drunk and the Sober” can be read at two levels: as a mystical poem at the surface, and as the poet’s socio-political criticism at the deeper layer of signification.",

Second, the paper presents a case study analysing a transnational high-speed railway located in the country of Laos. From this case study references and assumptions are combined into an attempt to analyse the economic, political, and socio-cultural implications of the Belt and Road Initiative in Thailand. The paper will attempt to draw conclusions from existing literature of economic development and how the different actors and levels operate within the development regime of the Belt and Road Initiative. As the Belt and Road Initiative is suspected to play a major part in the current re-structuring of the Southeast Asian region the process of regionalisation is highlighted as an important aspect of the Belt and Road Initiative and elaborated upon. It can be expected that the Belt and Road Initiative development regime exerts a variety of impacts at different levels identified as the national, regional, and local.",
Heike Hauntings: Taira Death Spirits in 19th Century Japanese Popular Prints,"Zonneveldt, Zeno Jaïr","['Müller, Doreen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"With this thesis, I want to focus on Kuniyoshi’s supernatural prints portraying one Japanese warrior house in particular: the Taira 平 clan. The Taira clan, also known as the Heike 平家, was one of the most prominent noble families of the Heian period (794 - 1185), even controlling the Emperor until they were finally defeated. Their tragic demise during the decisive naval Battle of Dan-no-Ura 壇ノ浦の戦い (1185) of the Genpei War 源平合戦 (1180 - 1185) at the hands of the Minamoto 源 clan, has gone down as one of the most infamous events in Japanese history. The rise and fall of the Taira has been popularized by the canonical work Heike Monogatari 平家物語, which describes the events leading up to and during the Genpei War. Although the author and the date of creation of the Heike Monogatari are unknown and much of its contents have been proven to be fictious, the Heike Monogatari has remained as one of the most important Japanese pieces of literature throughout the ages. Thus, it is no wonder that the tragic story of the Heike still captured the imagination of ukiyo-e artists during the late Edo period (1600 - 1868). By visually analyzing supernatural prints featuring the Taira clan of Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1798 - 1861), I hope to shed light on some elements underexplored by previous researchers. Rather than simple political satire, I argue that the charm of these prints for Edo townspeople was actually far wider and more varied. Dissecting the prints’ artistic and cultural elements one by one, I will attempt to lay bare the period eye and to surmise how a person living in the Edo period could have enjoyed them. I hope my research might deepen our shared understanding of Edo popular culture and its social and cultural background.","['Edo period', 'Popular prints', 'Genpei War', 'Heike Monogatari', 'Minamoto Yoshitsune', 'Taira no Tomomori', 'Musashibō Benkei']"
"Victims or victors?

Although women are often portrayed as primary victims of these crises, such moments of profound change can also offer possible positive changes for women. In this thesis, I analyse the impact of these two crises – the 2011 uprisings and the current conflict – on women’s political empowerment in Yemen. Did women get more opportunities to participate in politics due to these crises? Two important conclusions follow from this research. Firstly, there is a notable difference between women’s participation in informal politics and formal politics during and after crises; although women might be empowered in informal politics, this does not necessarily lead to empowerment in formal politics. And secondly, different crises have different impacts on women’s political participation. The nature of the subsequent formal political process determines the likelihood of women’s formal political empowerment.","['Yemen', 'Women', 'Crises', 'Political participation', 'Empowerment', 'War', '2011 uprisings']"
The Portrayal of Women in Chinese Popular Culture: Female Agency in the TV drama The Story of Yanxi Palace,"Warmerdam, Anica","['Nakamura, Mari']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis conveys an interpretation of the feminist timeline from the times of He Zhen and her Anarcho-feminist contemporaries in China, to Mao’s time, in which female Red Guards were second-class men, to recent times, in which feminist NGO’s are trying to obtain equal rights regarding gender equality. This thesis discusses the concept of agency as a praxis regarding the actions and speech of the main character of the popular Chinese TV Drama: The Story of Yanxi Palace. Agency as a praxis is the most fitting definition to use in the analysis of the portrayal of Wei Yingluo in The Story of Yanxi Palace. As a praxis, feminism is more practical and shows how a simple action could be called feminist, such as the speaking of Wei Yingluo and small actions individually. Post-Structuralist Deconstruction and Discourse Analysis have proven to be useful tools in analyzing the binaries present. Wei Yingluo stands up against a man of higher status. I argue that Wei Yingluo demonstrates agency in the scenes I discuss. In spite of the rules she walks her own path and finds a way out while both surviving and following her own set of morals. In this setting of Qing Imperial China, the rules and the balance of status were quite clear, yet speaking up was not easy. This thesis uses Post-Structuralist methods to deconstruct popular culture, in this case The Story of Yanxi Palace and argues that, using feminism as a praxis, Wei Yingluo shows agency in (almost) all of her actions and speech.","['Popular Culture', 'TV Drama', 'China', 'Portrayal of women', 'The Story of Yanxi Palace']"

Heteronormative Ideologies and the Cyborg in Ghost in the Shell,"Stuifbergen, Naomi","['Mes, Thomas']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Recent years have seen the release of a number of cyberpunk films and series, both in cinemas and on streaming services such as Netflix. Among them are Blade Runner 2049 (2017), Ghost in the Shell (2017), Altered Carbon (2018), and this year’s Alita: Battle Angel (2019). The original Blade Runner (1982) can be seen as the first cyberpunk movie with its benchmark depictions of a distinctly dystopian future and Asian oriented cityscapes. Ghost in the Shell and Alita: Battle Angel are both films based on Japanese anime. My focus of interest for the past year has been gender and sexuality, I have been combining this with my interest for Japanese animation. Cyberpunk has been particularly an interesting genre because it depicts our (generally dark) vision of a technologically advanced future, yet it actually tells more about our contemporary society and condition. The genre has often been critiqued on the fact it has been dominated by (white, straight) men, which produced the one-sided stereotyped depiction of women and minorities in the genre. Japan has often been the setting of these cyberpunk narratives. This had to do with Japan’s technological and economic growth in the 1980s, which caused fascination and anxiety towards Japan in the West. One of the reasons why the Hollywood version of Ghost in the Shell peaked my interest is because it is a recent live-action version of a very popular franchise that focuses on a female cyborg. It is additionally one out of many films that has been accused of whitewashing its main protagonist, which was a reason for me to not see this film when it played in theatres. Mamoru Oshii’s Ghost in the Shell from 1995 was an international co-production, and is considered to be one of the greatest anime films. The film also inspired the Wachowskis to make The Matrix trilogy, The Matrix is up to today one of the most well-known cyberpunk films. In my thesis I will be looking at the (heteronormative and race) ideologies that are at play in both of the Ghost in the Shell films. In my first chapter I will lay a foundation of the sides of cyberpunk I will focus on. I will discuss techno-Orientalism, Donna Haraway’s Cyborg Manifesto, cyberfeminism, and feminist post-cyberpunk. In my second chapter I will give an analysis of Rupert Sanders’ Ghost in the Shell film, while focusing on the ideology, queer moments, whitewashing, and oriental style. And finally in my third chapter I will focus on Mamoru Oshii’s Ghost in the Shell. As the “ghost” is a reference towards the soul (and spiritual identity), and the “shell” references towards the (mechanical) body, I will discuss identity, the male gaze, Haraway’s “informatics of domination”, and heteronormativity. I will also be discussing the possibilities and limitations of the cyborg body and the objectifications it goes through in both the GITS films.","['cyborg', 'cyberpunk', 'ghost in the shell', 'mamoru oshii', 'heteronormativity', 'techno-orientalism', 'feminism', 'hollywood', 'donna haraway']"

On August 10th, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture used article 16 on the Interim Regulations on the Administration of Internet Culture to censor a total of 120 Chinese songs from the internet. The ministry labeled the 120 songs as blacklisted, because their content was seen as ‘endangering social morality’, according to article 16. A key point of censorship and morality in music in China is that the Chinese government’s rules and regulations for what is considered moral and immoral in music are phrased in very generic terms, leaving room for interpretation. That leaves us with the question, can the blacklisting of the 120 songs be meaningfully related to these rules and regulations? This thesis explores the complex relationship between music, morality and politics in contemporary China by performing a discourse analysis on the banned songs and the legislations regarding internet culture.","['China', 'Music', 'Morality', 'Censorship', 'Hip-hop', 'Pop', 'Blacklist', 'Ban']"

Uit een bespreking van secundaire literatuur over sociale ontwikkelingen uit deze periode en een analyse van verschillende sugoroku uitgegeven tussen 1886 en 1910 blijkt dat de inhoud van de spellen beïnvloedt is door het sociale klimaat waarin gedebatteerd werd over de rol en identiteit van vrouwen. De sugoroku waren in staat om standpunten uit dit debat mee te geven aan spelers, voornamelijk door middel van het wel of niet representeren van bepaalde levensmogelijkheden voor vrouwen.

The Japanese Intelligence Community: Eastern Practices Seen Through Western Eyes,"Rense, Sheryl","['Veere, H. (Henny) van der']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The main aim of this thesis was to take a critical stance towards the Intelligence Cycle as the foremost model on intelligence processes. The research question was: To what extent can the Intelligence Cycle, as a model of analysis, account for non-Western intelligence organisational structures, such as the Japanese intelligence community? The conclusion of the thesis is that the Intelligence Cycle cannot fully account for non-Western intelligence organisational structures, and specifically that of Japan. This is because of several assumptions that emerged when applying the Intelligence Cycle to Japan: First, that foreign and domestic security scopes cannot be consolidated into one organisation, ignoring the Japanese practice of 'amakudari'. Second, the assumption of inevitable competition between similar intelligence organisations. Third, the lack of a modernised intelligence arsenal. Lastly, the assumption that Japanese intelligence personnel is not trained appropriately, ignoring the practice of 'amakudari' and 'tenkin'.","['intelligence', 'Japanese intelligence community', 'Intelligence Cycle', 'Asian security', 'amakudari', 'tenkin']"

"Why did ISIS use sexual and gender based violence against Yezidi girls and women: Obligation, Patriarchy, or Just a Tool of War?","Zaim, Yonca","['Calculli, Marina']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Five years have passed since the attack on Sinjar, and no one could have predicted the outcome we have witnessed. With the dismantling of ISIS, a myriad of consequences built over the years has come crashing down to the contemporary political climate. The quell of ISIS as a land-owning non-state actor may be seen as a victory, yet, the slow process of piecing together what truly happened behind the closed veil of the so-called Caliphate is the true feat. Among all of the unknown also lies the troublesome subject of sexual and gender based violence (SGBV). It is no secret that gender based violence played a prominent part in the so-called Islamic State’s reign to power, but the question remains; Why did ISIS use sexual and gender based violence against Yezidi girls and Women? There are three hypotheses that this thesis will test to understand ISIS’ use of rape against Yezidi girls and women: a) tool of war, b) patriarchy and c) religion. By analysing the rationale behind these three hypotheses this thesis will contribute to a more systematic understanding of ISIS’ modus operandi.","['Sexual and Gender Based Violence', 'Yezidi', 'Tool of War', 'Patriarchy', 'Religion', 'ISIS']"

China’s Changing Masculinity and the Influence of the Media,"Visser, Jonathan Jens","['Landsberger, Stefan R.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper investigates masculinity in Chinese media. Specifically, it was written to address “To what extent is the changing of masculinity in the Chinese media an indication of a changing of masculinity in wider society?” To achieve this, the paper will first lay out an overview over how Chinese masculinity has changed over the centuries and the last decades. In order to more easily assess issues regarding masculinity, it will borrow the wén-wǔ distinction introduced by Kam Louie. Then it will address the current relationship between the Chinese (state-) media and masculinity in China. The third part will focus on idols and beauty boys, two forms of masculinity that are criticised often by conservative voices. It will also include a discussion on how much women are involved in the changing masculine ideals. Consequently, this paper will analyse two media productions to see how they portray masculinity, what effects this would have, and how this is related to the literature discussed in this paper. And finally, this paper will conclude that rather than just a shift in masculinity, there is also an entrenchment of older masculine ideals taking place.","['Masculinity', 'China', 'Media']"

Archetype Reiterated; ‘Evil Stepmothers’ in K’ongchwi P’atchwi and Aschenputtel,"Dodds, Mary Elizabeth","['Park, Jin Hee']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Koreastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines the way in which the fairy-tale Stepmother is portrayed in two versions of the Korean ‘Cinderella Story’ of K’ongchwi P’atchwi, and the German Aschenputtel by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm. Its aim is to study the power structures, and the social and psychological patterns which create the ‘Evil’ of the Stepmothers in these versions of the ‘Cinderella Story’. This thesis is an attempt to shed some light on the cultural influences which have led to the creation of similar and yet different ‘Evil Stepmothers’, by using an ‘Integrated Approach’ which draws on the Archetypal and Post-modern schools of literary analysis. This approach plays to the strengths of both pre-existing approaches whilst giving a more complete analysis than either would have generated if used in isolation. The thesis concludes that the Stepmothers in the studied versions all have the same function: that of exemplifying the undesirable consequences of the abuse of power and, the ways in which undesirable dark side of the human psyche can manifest itself if one lets it do so. However, despite this shared function, the exact details of the Stepmother’s behaviors as well as other differences between the stories reflect the cultures in which they were created. In this way the abuse of power and the dark side of the human psyche are brought home to readers from different cultures through differing iterations of the Stepmother Archetype.","['Literary analysis', 't’onghap chŏpgŭn bŏp', 'Integrated approach', '(Evil) Stepmother', 'Archetypal and Post-Modernist Criticism', 'Cultural Contextual Analysis', 'Fairytales', 'Comparative Study', 'Korea', 'Aschenputtel and K’ongchwi P’atchwi']"

"The Credibility of Transnational, English-Language News Media in the Middle East: from the Al Jazeera Effect, to the PressTV and the TRT World Effect?","Borghols, Thomas","['Schonmann, Noa']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since its foundation in 1996, Al Jazeera and its English subsidiary Al Jazeera English, established in 2006, have revolutionized the Middle Eastern news media landscape by critically reporting on events in the immediate region and by emphasizing the experiences of people from the Global South. This lead to the coining of the term ‘the Al Jazeera effect’ by Philip Seib. However, the only directive issued by its main sponsor, the Qatari government, is that it should not put the monarchy in a negative light. While different countries in the Middle East have begun following Qatar’s footsteps by establishing English-language news media of their own, an issue that is materializing in parallel is the worldwide declining trust in the news media. As various news networks around the globe are seeing their credibility—the quality of being trusted—questioned, this thesis ties these two developments together by asking how Al Jazeera English, as well as two of its English-language competitors in the region, being PressTV from Iran and TRT World from Turkey, go about establishing their credibility. More particularly, how do these three networks fare when they report on a conflict in their proverbial backyard, the Syrian Civil War, the outcome of which concerns Qatar, Iran, and Turkey alike? By borrowing from the existing scholarly literature on the analysis of news media credibility, this thesis looks at YouTube material on the Syrian Civil War in the first five months of 2019 from the flagship current affairs discussion program on each network, Inside Story on Al Jazeera English, The Debate on PressTV, and The Newsmakers on TRT World in order to demonstrate whether the latter two networks cater for their own ‘effect’ in the Middle Eastern news media arena. Moreover, this thesis hopes to expand our understanding of how we should view the three news outlets: as critical watchdogs of political institutions, or as mouthpieces for their respective governments.","['News media', 'Credibility', 'Framing', 'Syrian Civil War', 'Al Jazeera English', 'PressTV', 'TRT World']"

Refashioning Approaches to Shunga: Overcoming Institutional Marginalization,"Coldesina, Manuela","['Müller, Doreen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Sexually explicit shunga of the Edo period have long been subjected to censorship and suppressive official attitudes. In the Meiji era, due to crypto-colonial pressures, censorship grew more stringent and persists until today. Even academic shunga publications long remained censored and their study has been marginalized within ukiyo-e research, both in Japan and abroad. With the liberalization of shunga publication in Japan, scholarship began closing the gaps in the field, shifting from aestheticizing to more critical approaches. However, despite the interconnectedness of shunga with ukiyo-e imagery, museum institutions have lagged behind in their inclusion. Thus, marginalizing and self-censoring institutional attitudes still persist, despite changing social ones, constructing a disjuncture between scholarly and institutional discourses on shunga. This thesis presents the 2013 British Museum exhibition and its 2015-2016 reshowing in Japan, which resulted from the international collaborative efforts of researchers and practitioners, as a model for overcoming institutional self-censorship and marginalization of shunga. Thus showing a way forward towards the inclusion of the sexually explicit genre.","['Shunga', 'Erotic art', 'Censorship', 'Crypto-colonialism', 'Japanese prints', 'Self-censorship']"
Tackling the Toxic Legacy of Uranium Mining; a Tale of Navajo Activism,"Donnio, Romane","['Fazzi, Dario']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis tells the tale of the toxic legacy of uranium mining, which has been casting a shadow over the lives of the Navajo people for over seven decades. Due to the rising tension between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, a nuclear arms race developed. In the United States, the government’s interest in uranium became a matter of top priority, which resulted in a mining boom. At first, the mining boom seemed like a blessing since it created many jobs. Especially for the Navajo people, a Native American tribe indigenous to the southwestern United States where uranium could be found in abundance. However, the initial excitement about these work opportunities was soon to be overshadowed by the toxicity of the work environment. For more than a decade, Navajo miners worked in this environment without any proper protection from the life threatening effects of uranium. And only in the 1960s, when the years of unprotected mining started taking its toll, was it that the Navajo people started to become aware of these dangers. What followed were three decades of organizing and activism on the part of the Navajo people, which eventually led to the passing of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) in 1990. Though this was a crucial moment for Navajo anti-uranium activism, it does not necessarily mean that the story of Navajo activism ends here. Nevertheless, little scientific work has been dedicated to the development of the story after 1990. Therefore, this thesis will shift the focus towards the direction that Navajo advocacy against the toxic legacy of uranium mining has taken after the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act was passed. Such post-1990 types of activism mainly focus on three concepts; compensation, cleanup and remembrance. When it comes to compensation, the main goal is the inclusion of post-1971 uranium workers for compensation under RECA. Current eligibility criteria exclude those employed as uranium miners after 1971, which is when the United States government stopped being the sole purchaser of uranium ore. However, those in favor of amending the Act to include post-71 workers are arguing that this date only signified the end of government liability, but not the end of the inadequacy of radiation standards. Another cause for activism is the immense impact that the uranium industry has had on the environment. Many abandoned uranium mines exist on Navajo lands and environmental issues range far beyond the impact of these mines alone. Additionally, President Trump’s 2017 Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth has fueled fears of uranium mining returning to Navajo lands. In response, the Navajo people are trying to remind the nation of the disastrous impact of the industry and the toxic legacy that it has left behind. The possibility of uranium mining returning to Navajo lands, the exclusion of post-71 workers and the continued risks due to environmental contamination are all part of the toxic legacy against which the Navajo people are still fighting today. The telling of the tale of the Navajo people and the toxic legacy of uranium mining as done in this research sheds light on the historic and current relevance of recognizing the impact of uranium mining and the need for solutions.","['Navajo', 'Native American', 'Uranium', 'Uranium mining', 'Activism', 'Radiation Exposure Compensation Act', 'Cleanup', 'Compensationation', 'Remembrance']"

The Malian conflict, which started in 2012, saw the activation of the African-led International Support Mission to Mali (AFISMA) as well as a French military intervention called Operation Serval. However, in July 2013 AFISMA was superseded by a UN-led military operation while the French mission remained functional. This case study reflects the issue regarding the lack of African agency. By using an analytical framework of power in international politics, this study seeks to understand this dynamic as it pertains to the case study. The findings show that France, via a Realist understanding, is the primary power in the conflict out to seek its own security. Simultaneously, African agency is not realisable due to the inherent inferiority of African institutions compared to the UN and France.","['ECOWAS', 'the United Nations', 'France', 'Power', 'Realism', 'Liberalism', 'the UN', 'AFISMA', 'MINUSMA']"

"Civil Documentation Strategies in Light of the Syrian Refugee Crisis: A Case Study of Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey","Romana, Osman","['Marina, Calculli']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The overwhelming majority of the more than five and a half million Syrians have fled to neighboring countries in the Middle East without their civil documents. Particularly in a refugee context, it is crucial for the standard of living for Syrian refugees and eventual return to Syria to be adequately documented. Complex civil registration systems in the host countries, however, often prevent Syrian refugees from obtaining civil documentation, thereby expanding the problem of the lack and loss of civil documentation of Syrian refugees. This thesis examines the different civil registration systems and their consequences for Syrian refugees in Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon through an in-depth analysis focusing on legal status, marriage and birth registration. This thesis argues that the difference in implemented civil registration systems is determined by each host country’s social, political, and economic situation before and during the Syrian refugee influx and the extent to which the Syrian refugees have impacted the country, positively and negatively. In Turkey, the government has adopted a temporary protection regime, which includes refugee-sensitive civil registration systems. However, in Lebanon and to a lesser extent Jordan, Syrian refugees are still facing many challenges trying to obtain civil documentation due to the complex civil registration systems. As the eight years of hosting refugees has turned out more harmful than beneficial for the host countries, discussions on the return of Syrian refugees has increasingly become louder. However, a lot of change is still required to ensure that Syrian refugees are adequately documented.","['documentation', 'Syria', 'Jordan', 'Turkey', 'refugees', 'civil documentation', 'registration strategies', 'Lebanon', 'civil registration systems']"

De-Europeanization in the United Kingdom: British discourse on the EU before and after the Brexit referendum,"Amelsvoort, Paul van","['Schaper, Herman']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines how British prime ministers have de-Europeanized the national identity through their discourse before and after the Brexit referendum – or in other words – how they turned away from the EU by using language. The research is conducted through a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of 25 speeches and statements by David Cameron and Theresa May. The timeframe begins when Cameron promised a referendum on EU membership in January 2013, and ends in October 2017, more than a year after the yes-vote. The analysis reveals that British discourse on common security threats was not gradually de-Europeanized, but internationalised by May by constructing the UK as ‘Global Britain’. Language on migrants from the EU to the UK was already de-Europeanized before the Brexit referendum, and did not change significantly after the referendum. In fact, it gradually normalised after Cameron’s General Election victory in 2015. This study also reveals that both prime ministers could ‘cherry pick’ identities, meaning that they could choose between constructing a national, European, or even global identity to their liking per policy area.","['Europeanization', 'Discourse analysis', 'Constructivism', 'United Kingdom', 'European Union', 'Foreign policy', 'Brexit', 'Russia', 'Migration']"

For this reason, this thesis examines whether different levels and functions of broken English can be identified within a comic, and which translation strategies and procedures should be applied in order to maintain in the target text the source text’s broken English level and function. In order to arrive to any significant conclusion regarding the level of broken English, a scale of levels has been designed based on the CEFR (Council of Europe, 2018a; 2018b) and ACTFL (ACTFL, 2018) scales. Moreover, two sub-questions have been formulated in order to gauge the function of broken English within the narrative. Also, the translation strategies and procedures coined by Newmark (1988), Vinay and Darbelnet (1995; 2008), and Venuti (2008b) have been compiled into a customised list containing the relevant strategies and procedures tied with the restrictions encountered in Comic Translation. These three models have been applied to the broken English of the Russian gangsters in Hawkeye (Fraction, 2013), Vladek in Maus (Spiegelman, 2003), and Yoda in Star Wars (Aaron, 2018). The gangsters’ broken English is characterised by its excessive use of the cultural expression “bro”, which becomes the object of the hero’s mockery. Gangsters are found to speak broken English as spoken by speakers of the lowest level of the scale of broken English. On the other hand, Vladek’s and Yoda’s broken English is characterised by their eccentric word order, which seems to be in tune with the role they play within their story. According to the scale of levels of broken English devised in this thesis, Yoda speaks according to the highest level on the scale, whereas Vladek’s level of broken English can be found in between the levels of Yoda and the Russian gangsters. Lastly, I have found that for each translation strategy, three different translation procedures occur most frequently and can be said to be characteristic of this strategy; the oblique translation strategy is characterised by the use of the procedures economy, semantic translation, and communicative translation, while usage of the procedures compensation, economy, and free translation characterise the foreignisation strategy.","['Broken English', 'Comic Translation', 'Translation Studies', 'Hawkeye', 'Maus', 'Star Wars', 'Comic Literature', 'Broken English in Comic Translation']"

Solidarity within the European Union during the refugee crisis of 2015/2016; a case study of the Netherlands,"Jansen van Rosendaal, Madelon","['Cusumano, E.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The European Union (EU) has played a vital role in the creation of the globalized world known today. Through the many challenges and setbacks the union has experienced the past decades it has demonstrated how unification and cooperation has become increasingly important. This study argues how in this process of globalized consolidation solidarity plays a vital role. Communities such as the EU rely to a large extent on all its member states involved willing to be solidary. The aim of this study has been to find justification for demonstrating solidarity during the refugee crisis of 2015/2016. This has been done by examining Dutch media and interviewing Dutch government officials. Upon examination of the sources, it became clear that the failures of the most important EU asylum regulations were due to a lack of solidarity. The theory of intergovernmentalism demonstrated how states preferred applying their own national regulations instead of following the supra-national EU policies. By applying the theories of instrumental and normative solidarity this study was able to grasp an idea of what is vital to improve in order to increase solidarity in the union. Focusing on the self-interest of the member states within the union is vital in order to stimulate solidarity. The member state should be well informed of why it is beneficial to be part of the EU. In addition, the union should focus on further developing a European identity among its residents in order to improve the feeling of solidary.","['Refugee crisis', 'European Union', 'the Netherlands', 'Solidarity']"

Het media-aanbod in de grote stad. Is een pluriformer nieuwslandschap inhoudelijk diverser?,"Hol, Twan Leo Jan","['Koetsenruijter, A. Willem M.', 'Pleijter, A.R.J.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Al jaren is er vanuit verschillende hoeken kritiek op het Nederlandse nieuwsecosysteem. Er verdwijnen titels en media hebben niet meer de capaciteit om nieuwsgebeurtenissen vanuit verschillende perspectieven te belichten. Dit blijkt des te meer in lokale nieuwsecosystemen. Dit is een gevaar voor de lokale democratie, omdat een divers nieuwsaanbod belangrijk is om iedere bevolkingsgroep een stem te geven. Verschillende organisaties en instituten richten zich daarom op het behoud van diversiteit in de media en stimuleren media die de diversiteit kunnen vergroten. In het terugbrengen van die diversiteit worden vaak alternatieve media als oplossing genoemd. Zij kunnen nieuwe perspectieven bieden en divers nieuws aanbieden. Daar is echter niet iedereen het over eens. Deze scriptie probeert een bijdrage te leveren aan dit debat door te onderzoeken of een medialandschap met meer alternatieve media ook een diverser nieuwsaanbod heeft. De onderzoeksvraag van deze scriptie is als volgt: ‘In welke mate staat het aandeel van alternatieve media binnen lokale medialandschappen in de grootste steden van Nederland in relatie tot de inhoudelijke diversiteit in deze landschappen?’. Deze scriptie vindt plaats binnen het kader van een onderzoek van het Stimuleringsfonds voor de Journalistiek naar de nieuwsecosystemen in de vier grote steden van Nederland. In dit vervolg worden data gebruikt die in drie steden, Amsterdam, Den Haag en Utrecht, verzameld zijn. Ten eerste wordt gezocht naar de steden met het minste en juist grootste aandeel van alternatieve media. Daarna worden deze steden vergeleken op het gebied van diversiteit aan de hand van vier indicatoren: genres, onderwerpen, bronnen en herkomst van online berichten. Tenslotte worden ook alternatieve media met traditionele media op deze punten vergeleken. Als maat voor diversiteit is de Herfindahl-Hirschman index gebruikt. De uitkomsten voor dit onderzoek worden geduid met behulp van een theoretisch kader dat bestaat uit theorieën over het democratisch belang van journalistieke diversiteit en theorieën die uitleggen wat media pluriformiteit en diversiteit zijn of zou moeten zijn. Ook de concepten traditionele/alternatieve media, gatekeeping en churnalism komen aan bod. Utrecht blijkt het grootste aandeel berichten van alternatieve media te hebben, Amsterdam juist het minste. De data wijzen uit dat het nieuwsaanbod in Utrecht echter niet diverser is. Slechts de diversiteit op het gebied van genres lijkt enigszins groter. Het grootste verschil blijkt uit de originaliteit van de berichten. Dit komt ook naar voren bij de vergelijken tussen de twee mediasoorten. Bijna een kwart van de berichten in Utrecht is niet origineel. In Amsterdam zijn alle berichten origineel. Alternatieve media lijken het nieuwsecosysteem niet diverser te maken. Dit onderzoek toont echter geen causaal verband aan. Vervolgonderzoek dat een causaal verband tussen de aanwezigheid van alternatieve media en de diversiteit van het nieuwsaanbod kan leggen is daarom gewenst.","['Media pluriformiteit', 'Churnalism', 'Gatekeeping', 'Burgerjounalistiek', 'Alternatieve Media', 'Traditionele Media', 'Nieuwsecosysteem', 'Lokale journalistiek', 'Media diversiteit', 'Herfindahl-Hirschman Index']"

Dealing with the challenging commonality of the heritage traces of former colonial presence overseas,"Dhert, Julia","[""O'Malley, A.M. (Alanna)""]",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Although the period of colonial rule by the Netherlands and Portugal is a thing of the past, there is a plenitude of ‘overseas cultural heritage’ (OCH) around the world, referring to unmoveable heritage sites that were created under the colonial influence or former presence of nation states on a territory that is not part of these states today. Policy regarding OCH offers complex challenges and possibilities to present-day governments as the heritage is at the crossroads of the cultural and political involvement of both the former colonized and colonizer and thus bridges the colonial past into the current postcolonial reality. Nevertheless, research analysing and comparing OCH policy of former colonial powers at several levels of governance is rare. This thesis builds on, and adds to, the existing research by conducting a multidisciplinary (policy analysis and heritage definition analysis) and multilateral (bilateral and multilateral) comparative analysis of the OCH-policy of the Netherlands and Portugal. At core is the research question: what policy strategy have the Dutch and Portuguese governments developed concerning their OCH in the past century at both bilateral and multilateral level of governance, and to what extent are the policy strategies comparable? To answer this main research question, the thesis conducts a multidisciplinary analysis that combines a policy analysis of the OCH-policy of the Netherlands and Portugal at bilateral and multilateral level of governance at UNESCO, with the examination of the heritage definition at the heart of the existing policy, the latter by examining how the policy deals with the challenging commonality of OCH. The research enabled to map the differences and commonalities of the Dutch and Portuguese OCH-policy strategies.","['international cutural policy', 'colonial heritage', 'overseas cultural heritage', 'Portugal', 'Netherlands', 'UNESCO', 'multilevel policy analysis', 'World Heritage of Portuguese Origin', 'Netherlands Funds-in-Trust']"

Compliance with EU Directives: Transposition and Legal Fit in the Netherlands,"Atangana Bekono, Shana","['Oster, J.S.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The main topic of this thesis is compliance with EU directives with a special focus on the issue of timely and correct transposition in the Netherlands. In a broader scope, the issue of transposition has been extensively covered by the literature on compliance. However, this research adopts a new approach in which possible links between transposition performance and the degree of legal misfit are explored. Doing so, this thesis aims to answer the following research question: To what extent does legal misfit influence the transposition performance of the Netherlands? Based on the literature study the following hypothesis was introduced: The higher the degree of legal misfit the higher the impact on transposition performance. This hypothesis is tested through three directives of the Area of Freedom Security and Justice. This is done by conducting qualitative research that is based on a four-fold classification model that determines the degree of legal misfit of the directives based on the number and extent of the required amendments to the national legal framework. The findings of the analysis of the directives show no direct evidence that unambiguously support the hypothesis. As the hypothesis is rejected, it is concluded that legal misfit only influences the transposition performance of Member States to a limited extent and that the extent is hard to determine.","['compliance', 'directives', 'transposition']"

The role of ‘othering’ in the Turkey EU accession negotiations - A critical discourse analysis,"El-Zayat, Sukayna","['Smith, R.K.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Turkey has applied to be member of the European Community already in 1987. Up to this day however, it has not joined and the negotiations have come to a halt. The debate about whether Turkey should join the European Union and whether it is compatible with its community has been highly politicised over the last years. The discussion usually revolves around whether Turkey is Eu- ropean enough to be a part of the Union, whether it fulfils all the fundamental criteria to join on an economic, political and social level as well as whether Turkey’s membership would bring about a form of cultural clash. The discourse around the topic and the language employed by policy makers has so far not been as well researched. This paper therefore explores the following research questi- on: “What is the role of an ‘othering’ discourse in the Turkey EU membership negotiations?”. It explores the theoretical framework of Othering and how it connects to the concept of Orientalism. Building on how Europe historically defines itself against an Other, both sides will be analysed on their language. Using methods of critical discourse analysis, the language of Turkish and EU insti- tutional policy makers is examined. Based on this research, tentative conclusions are drawn about the underlying meaning of speeches and remarks and how they fit into the framework of Othering.","['othering', 'constructivism', 'Turkey', 'EU membership', 'EU enlargement', 'orientalism', 'islamophobia', 'identity politics', 'discourse analysis']"

Chemical Weapons and the Red Lines of Civilised Warfare,"Kooter, Ruby","['Smith, Karen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The argument presented in this thesis is that constructivist theory offers a useful tool to interpret the effect that CW use has on the international community. It is the social identities and the strong prohibitive norm when it comes to the use of CW that construes a reality in which narratives of justification are produced when it comes to the use of force. This moral reality cannot be explained solely rationally, but has roots in decades of social interaction, which makes that violations of norms concerning CWs are put higher on the international agenda than other violations. The relevance of this study lies in the reflection on constructivism as a theoretical tool, but also in its aim to contribute to a broader understanding of how certain types of harm raise more attention in international politics: what causes the international community to be concerned about norm violation? As obvious as the answer of ‘inhumane practices’ seems, it is just a small percentage of suffering that becomes an international concern. The following puzzle has led to the research question: how can we explain the international community’s particular concern about violations of the norm on the prohibition of chemical weapons by using constructivist theory?","['Syria', 'Chemical', 'Weapons', 'Constructivism']"

Voetbal heeft in Argentinië altijd een prominente rol gespeeld in combinatie met politiek. Vanaf de regering van president Juan Domingo Perón in de periode 1946 1955 begon voetbal een steeds grotere rol te spelen in de Argentijnse politiek. Deze combinatie van voetbal en politiek werd gekenmerkt door twee aspecten: het creëren van een nationale culturele identiteit als gevolg van de massa-immigratie en het creëren van een loyale groep aanhangers van het regime. Voetbal was de manier om een eenheid te vormen en werd dan ook gezien als een belangrijk instrument. In 1978 wordt dit instrument op een andere wijze geütiliseerd. Tijdens het dictatoriale regime van generaal Jorge Videla wordt het Wereldkampioenschap Voetbal gebruikt als politieke propaganda en manipulatiemiddel om de gewelddadige situatie in het land te maskeren. Ondanks het verschil in regimes en beweegredenen, werd er gebruik gemaakt van hetzelfde instrument voor politieke doeleinden, namelijk het voetbal.

This thesis endeavours to identify the rationales of the CPD through an analysis of its structure and the aims of the new media-management strategy. As a case study, eight video clips will be analysed, interpreted and discussed alongside the academic research in order to draw conclusions. On the basis of the video clip analyses, the conclusion is that the CPD tells four different narratives at this moment: the Chinese Dream and rejuvenation discourse; the Belt and Road Initiative; China’s desire to pursue diversity and inclusivity for all in the international system; and using Xi Jinping as a popular idol. Moreover, this thesis shows that the clips fit in the longer tradition of Chinese political communication in the form of visual tifa.","['China', 'political communication', 'propaganda', 'video clips', 'new media-management strategy', 'tifa', 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'Xi Jinping']"

The Dutch Spainfighters: The role of national sentiments in a transnational environment,"Beaufort, Romée","['Storm, Eric']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The focus of this thesis is on the role of the Dutch national identity in the perceptions and experiences of a wide array of Dutch Spainfighters, who volunteered to fight on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s. It aims to understand how the volunteers dealt with the potential for clashes between the imagined communities of the Dutch nation-state and the border transcending, transnational appeal of their left-wing ideology. This thesis demonstrates that they felt loyalty both to the transnational community of left-wing and communist sympathizers, and the national Dutch community. It argues that the motivation of the Spainfighters is closely linked to their national identity, which they tried to construct in symbiosis with their transnational thoughts via the message of anti-fascism. As such, the thesis adds to the understanding of the phenomenon of foreign fighters. Next to the conscious building of national identity, national sentiments and practical culture played a considerable role in the daily reality of the Spainfighters, which is especially relevant if the rather mythical image of the International Brigades as a classic example of a transnational army is taken into account. As the case of the Dutch Spainfighters illustrates, the International Brigades provided space and even recognition for national identity as an organizing entity and as such functioned more as an ideologically motivated international army. For this reason, this thesis suggests that the fundaments of the supposedly transnational movement of support to the Spanish Republic may partly be built on national tensions and the resulting compromises. While studying transnational movements in the twentieth century, it therefore may be worth the effort to analyze the role of national identity, of national political culture.","['national identity', 'Spanish Civil War', 'foreign volunteers', 'International Brigades', 'transnational movement', 'Spainfighters', 'communism', 'fascism', 'foreign fighters']"

Yeah right!? Is this a default ironic construction? An analysis of English ironic constructions on Twitter,"Stevens, Emmy","['Boogaart, R.J.U.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Verbal irony has been a topic of study for several decades and conclusive answers to what it is and how language users correctly understand each other’s ironic expressions are difficult to provide. Saying the opposite of what you actually mean does not seem the most effective way of communicating at first sight, but it has proven to be used over and over again without much misunderstanding. Several theories have been proposed in the past few decades that try to explain the concept of verbal irony (among others Grice 1975; Wilson & Sperber 1992; Giora 1997; Tobin & Israel 2012). Most theories on verbal irony share the idea that irony is best defined as an utterance with a literal evaluation that is implicitly opposite to its intended evaluation (Burgers & Van Mulken 2013: 184). According to Giora and others (see for example Giora, Drucker & Fein 2014), constructions (form-meaning pairs) can even be interpreted ironically by default, when the interpretation that springs to mind first is the ironic interpretation, whether presented in isolation or in a context biasing towards that ironic interpretation. This claim is based solely on experimental research with constructed examples (among others Giora et al. 2015; Giora, Givoni & Fein 2015; Giora et al. 2018). However, to support the claim of default ironic interpretation actual language data should be involved, but such corpus studies on ironic constructions are rare. This study builds on two previous studies investigating Dutch ironic constructions on Twitter (Walles 2016; Stevens 2018), and it extends the scope to ironic constructions in English. By comparing three corpora each containing 2,000 tweets with one of the three hashtags #irony, #not, and #sarcasm with a corpus containing 15,000 general English tweets, 30 words and 22 phrases appeared to occur significantly more often in the ironic tweets. These words and phrases were used to compile a new corpus, containing one hundred tweets for each word or phrase. An analysis of the tweets showed that only four were used ironically significantly more often, namely 'classy', 'I’m shocked', 'what a surprise', and 'yeah right'. Exploring the ironic meaning of these four constructions from a constructionist point of view is fruitful, since their ironic meaning can be better understood as these constructions are considered as one unit to which the ironic meaning is assigned. These constructions underwent subjectification: its ironic evaluation has become part of the conventional meaning of the construction and the usage of the construction is expanded to a wider range of communicative contexts in which it conveys an ironic attitude (Verhagen 2000). This gradual conventionalization of the ironic evaluation explains why certain constructions are used more frequently with an ironic intent than others: those constructions have progressed further in the conventionalization process and the ironic meaning has become more closely attached to the construction (Claridge 2011). Nevertheless, the four ironic constructions in the Twitter corpus could not be classified as default ironic constructions, as there are still cases in which they are used literally. The notion of default ironic interpretation is problematic, as the analysis of actual language data do not support the view that one particular construction is always and only used ironically.","['verbal irony', 'default ironic constructions', 'Construction Grammar', 'conventionalization of meaning', 'corpus analysis', 'Twitter']"

Cultural References in Dutch Subtitles: Translation Strategies used in Langs de Oevers van de Yangtze,"Wijbenga, Addy","['Rodrigues Fonte, Catarina']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Dutch television programme Langs de Oevers van de Yangtze (“Alongside the Yangtze Shores”; 2016) was a great success in the Netherlands with a million viewers weekly and a nomination for two Dutch television awards (Lips, 2018). The programme concerns Chinese modern lifestyle and it is spoken in both Dutch and Chinese, the latter being subtitled in Dutch. Since this programme has a focus on Chinese culture, it is relevant for the audience to have a full grasp of the meaning of the Extralinguistic Cultural References (ECRs). Preliminary academic research has shown a gap in the study of both written and subtitled translation of ECRs from Chinese into a Germanic language. The aim of this research is therefore to investigate which translation strategies were used for the translation of cultural references in the subtitles of Langs de Oevers van de Yangtze. All the ECRs in the program have been categorized based on the taxonomy of ECRs provided by Nedergaard-Larsen (1993) and the translation strategy for each ECR has been determined according to Pedersen’s taxonomy for ECRs in subtitles (2011). The results showed that for the categories geography, society and culture, most of the used translation strategies are source-oriented, whereas for the history category both source-oriented strategies and target-oriented strategies are used the same number of times. For the categories society and culture the most used strategy is direct translation. Direct translation is also the most used strategy in the category history along with the translation strategy generalization. For the category geography, the most used translation strategy is retention. In addition, the results showed that the subtitler also uses the Dutch commentary as a strategy in translating ECRs.","['Translation', 'Translation Strategies', 'ECR', 'Cultural references', 'Subtitles']"
The Rastafari in Ethiopia: Challenges and Paradoxes of Belonging,"Beyecha, Mahlet Ayele","['Bruijn, Mirjam de']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Abstract Inspired by personal experience, this research analyzes the challenges and paradoxes of belonging of the Rastafari returnees in Ethiopia. With a biblically and historically buildt identity, the Rastafari have formed a strong identity and view Ethiopia as Zion. However, the whistle that signaled repatriation is the 500 acres land grant given by His Imperial Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie I to the black peoples of the world, mainly those in the west, as a token of gratitude for reaching out to Ethiopia and its people during the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. The Rastafari people returned to Ethiopia, the Promised Land, fulfilling their “homecoming.” The research examines the multi-dynamic facets of the Rastafari community’s confrontations on their journey of striving to make a home and feel at home, thereby unravelling the consistent conditions that facilitated the contradicting relationship of the community with Ethiopia and Ethiopians. In order to do so, the research identifies the challenges and investigates how these are manifested and how the paradoxes of the community are demonstrated. Capitalizing on the opportunity of meeting the global Rastafari, the research curiously inquires whether the challenges faced by the community in Ethiopia are shared by Rastafari elsewhere. Furthermore, the study cross-examines the applicability of the directive issued by the Ethiopian government. In the absence of full integration, the research investigates whether the community in Ethiopia is leveraging on its international connections. To respond to these questions, the study makes use of Horst Moller’s theories on identity of (MacLeod, 2014), Nyamonjah’s belongingness (2006), the homeland-diaspora relationship examined by Wingrod and Levi (2006), and the zones of transit identified by Akinyoade and Gewald (2015). The research was conducted through an ethnographic approach in the Rastafari community in Ethiopia, with the researcher being a quasi-member of that community. Open interviews and participant observation are what the researcher immersed herself into in order to collect data. The personal experience and some specific quotes of the informants are compartmentalized to form the themes of the subjects included. This research-at-home also brings the personal experience to the text with the intention of enriching and deepening the experience of the reader. Unexpected events gave way to methods of unintended findings that perfectly and coherently suited the thesis, as it provides information on whether the experience of the Rastas in Ethiopia is shared by other Rastafari in Africa and globally. These events further helped to bring a fresh knowledge by thoroughly assessing the practicality of the directive concerning the Rastafari, which was issued by the Ethiopian government. The apparent persistence of the trans-nationality of the Rastafari cannot go unchecked. Therefore, the researcher shares the data collected in this regard. I conclude that the post-repatriation era of the Rastafari in Ethiopia is crammed with consistent tribulations, ironies, and paradoxes perpetuated by the state, by local Ethiopians and by the returnees themselves. However, this research equally concludes that, despite the challenges the Rastafari face in their daily lives, they are determined to stay ‘home.’","['Rastafari Movement', 'Rastafari in Ethiopia', 'Pan-African movement', 'Ethiopian World Federation in Ethiopia', 'Challenges of Rastafari in Ethiopia', 'Shared Challenges', 'Catch 22 of Rastafari', 'Guideline 21/2009', 'Paradoxes of Rastafari in Ethiopia', 'Narratives on Method']"
Zowel het meest nabije als het vreemdste: Een vergelijking van de relatie tussen mens en dier in drie romans,"Deegens, Vivian","['Boletsi, Maria']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Film- en literatuurwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze studie bespreekt de verhouding tussen dieren en menselijke personages in drie verschillende romans: In ongenade van J.M. Coetzee, De ondraaglijke lichtheid van het bestaan van Milan Kundera en Niemands bruid van Meg Rosoff. Het eerste hoofdstuk bevat een bespreking van belangrijke momenten uit de geschiedenis van het denken over mens en dier in het Westen, gevolgd door een bespreking van theorie over de mens-dierverhouding in de literatuur. In de hedendaagse discussie over de verhouding tussen mens en dier lijkt men zich nog af te zetten tegen de benaderingen van de relatie tussen mens en dier uit het verleden. In het verleden werd het dier namelijk overwegend beschouwd als inferieur aan de mens. Met deze vergelijking van drie romans hoop ik een bijdrage te leveren aan de discussie binnen de Animal Studies. In het tweede hoofdstuk worden de drie romans geanalyseerd. De deelvragen behandelen de aanleiding van dierbeschrijvingen in de romans; de verhouding tussen de visie op de relatie tussen mens en dier van de hoofdpersonages ten opzichte van de visie hierop van de roman als geheel; de ruimte die het dier biedt aan de lezer voor een andere invalshoek op het verhaal. In het derde hoofdstuk worden de romans vergeleken. De filosofische kern van de roman De ondraaglijke lichtheid van het bestaan ontvouwt zich in het plot. Deze structuur houdt ook in dat de dierbeschrijvingen steeds onderdeel uitmaken van filosofische weerspiegelen van het personage Tereza of van de externe verteller. De dierbeschrijvingen waarbij Tereza focaliseert zijn veelal gemotiveerd in haar herkenning van eigenschappen of omstandigheden bij zichzelf of bij het personage Tomas. De toegevoegde waarde van het dier lijkt in verschillen te liggen die zij tussen dier en mens ziet. Deze verschillen geven haar besef van een potentieel aanwezige andere wereld, en kan haar tot filosofische inzichten brengen over eigenschappen die dier en mens delen, zoals hun kwetsbaarheid. Ook kan het verschil betekenen dat zij bij de dieren iets aantreft wat zij bij mensen niet kan vinden, zoals de rust die hun cyclische tijdsbeleving met zich meebrengt. Daarenboven weerspiegelt de externe verteller op metaniveau over het gedrag en de beweegredenen van Tereza, en hoe zij zich tot dieren verhoudt. Voor het andere hoofdpersonage genaamd Tomas lijkt het dier minderwaardig aan de mens. Hij beschouwt de hond die hij voor Tereza heeft uitgezocht bijvoorbeeld geheel in de geest van de functie die hij aan het dier heeft toebedeeld: de band tussen hem en Tereza vergroten. Aan het begin van de roman In ongenade het hoofdpersonage David hij dieren als gelijkwaardig aan de mens te zien, maar als totaal anders. Mens en dier leven in zijn visie langs elkaar heen. In de loop van het verhaal gaat hij zich steeds meer in de dieren herkennen. Hier wil hij echter eerst niet aan, omdat hij dat ook zijn status, als iemand die in ongenade is gevallen, moet aanvaarden. Een symptoom hiervan is dat David geen aansluiting vindt bij andere personages. De afstand tussen David en andere menselijke personages is hierdoor vergroot. Aan het einde van de roman gaat David zich aan de dieren hechten. De dieren lijken echter niet meer functies te hebben dan die van abstractie, symbool en metafoor. De dieren zijn wel belangrijk in zoverre zij een proces in gang zetten bij het hoofdpersonage, maar dit wordt veroorzaakt door de gelijkenissen die het hoofdpersonage David ziet in de dieren. De dieren zetten daar wel een belangrijk proces in gang bij het hoofdpersonage, maar dit komt door gelijkenissen die het hoofdpersonage David ziet in de dieren. De dieren lijken niet meer functies te hebben dan die van abstractie, symbool en metafoor. In Niemands bruid staat de visie op de mens-dierrelatie voor het hoofdpersonage Pell in dienst van de mogelijkheden die het dier geeft om haar eigen keuzes te maken. Pell begrijpt dieren beter dan mensen, maar ze behandelt de dieren in haar gedrag niet als gelijken en blijft wel hun baas. Ze lijkt haar talent om dieren te begrijpen in te zetten om meer aansluiting te vinden bij mensen. Pell kijkt bijvoorbeeld hoe dieren op specifieke mensen reageren, om te zien of de mensen te vertrouwen zijn. Ook analyseert en beschrijft zij de overeenkomsten tussen dieren en mensen. Pells paard Jack is een dierlijke belichaming. De geschiedenis van het dier wordt beschreven, en zijn focalisatie wordt meermaals weergegeven. In zijn geschiedenis fungeert het dier als spiegel voor het personage Pell dat zich afzet tegen de rol die haar is toebedeeld door haar omgeving. In haar positie is Pell bovendien radicaal anders dan haar menselijke omgeving te noemen: zij zet zich af van de mensen, die zij als vreemd en onbetrouwbaar ervaart, en ze vindt herkenning bij dieren. De visie van de roman zelf is dat iemand, bijvoorbeeld door middel van dieren, kan leren om eigen keuzes te maken in het leven en als volwassene een plaats te vinden in de wereld.","['Dieren', 'Mensen', 'Animal Studies', 'In ongenade', 'Niemands bruid', 'De ondraaglijke lichtheid van het bestaan', 'Rol van het dier', 'Literatuur', 'Antropomorfisme']"
Empathy for Ecosystems : On the Environmental Orientation of Videogames,"op de Beke, Laura","['Hoving, Isabel']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Videogame scholar James Paul Gee has wondered on numerous occasions whether videogames have the capacity to inspire “a sort of embodied empathy for complex systems.” In this thesis I take that question one step further and ask whether they can do so for virtual ecosystems. In other words this thesis explores whether what makes up the environmental orientation of videogames, among other things, is a sense of embodied empathy for the ecosystems they simulate, and from what procedural, narrative, and visual conditions this sense of empathy may be derived. In order to provide a more substantial theoretical ground from which to launch my inquiry, I develop Gee’s understanding of embodiment according to Gordon Calleja’s concept of “incorporation,” which helps me clarify how videogames involve players in ecosystems in ways that are medium-specific. Additionally, I reconceptualize the notion of empathy according to Robert Pogue Harrison’s “garden of care,” from which I distil a particular kind of emotional and ethical response to the environment, one that I conclude features differently in each of the games I single out for analysis: Fate of the World, Waking Mars, and Stardew Valley. This response, which is founded on responsibility and engagement plays an important role in their environmental orientation by establishing a relationship of care between the player and the game environment. The nature of this relationship however, is different in each encounter, depending on the way the game environment manifests itself, and how openly it solicits care.","['Environmental Videogame Criticism', 'The Environmental Humanities', 'Empathy for Ecosystems', 'Incorporated Care Ethics', 'Fate of the World', 'Waking Mars', 'Stardew Valley']"
