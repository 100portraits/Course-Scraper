De relatie tussen angstdispositie en de afname van het nocebo effect,"Hoeke, Niels","['Meijer, S.', 'Middendorp, H. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek werd onderzocht welke relatie er bestaat tussen angstdispositie en de effectiviteit van verschillende methodes om het nocebo-effect af te laten nemen (i.e. counterconditionering en extinctie). Bij het nocebo-effect ontstaat er een negatief effect bij het nemen van een medicijn of een placebo, dat niet toe te schrijven is aan de werkende bestanddelen hiervan. Ook werd onderzocht of één van de twee methodes een sterkere samenhang vertoonde met angstdispositie dan de andere methode. Aan het onderzoek deden 108 vrouwelijke participanten mee. Voor aanvang van het experiment werd eerst de STAI-T afgenomen om de angstdispositie van de participanten vast te stellen. Vervolgens werd conditionering gebruikt om het nocebo-effect op te wekken bij de participanten. Hierna werd bij sommige participanten counterconditionering gebruikt om het nocebo-effect te verlagen en werd bij andere participanten extinctie gebruikt. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat een hogere angstdispositie samenhangt met een sterkere afname van het nocebo-effect via counterconditionering, r(26) = 0.48, p = 0.012. Er is echter geen relatie tussen angstdispositie en de afname van het nocebo-effect via extinctie, r(28) = 0.10, p = 0.615. Er is tussen de twee methodes geen significant verschil gevonden in de kracht van de relatie tussen angstdispositie en de afname van het nocebo-effect, z = 1.48, p = 0.1389. Mensen met een hogere angstdispositie kunnen dus mogelijk meer profiteren van counterconditionering en dus moet in de toekomst meer rekening worden gehouden met angstdispositie wanneer wordt overwogen om counterconditionering te gebruiken bij het behandelen van het nocebo-effect.",

Empathie bij normaal ontwikkelende Nederlandse kinderen: De invloed van leeftijd en gender op het beoordelen van sociale situaties,"Veenstra, Nienke","['Overgaauw, S.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Empathisch vermogen wordt cruciaal tijdens de adolescentie, wanneer het centraal wordt om relaties met leeftijdsgenoten te onderhouden en emoties te kunnen begrijpen en delen (Masten, Eisenberger, Pfeifer & Dapretto, 2010). Dit onderzoek kijkt naar of empathisch vermogen verbetert met de leeftijd en of jongens en meisjes verschillende sociale situaties (daders van fysieke pijn en sociale exclusie) verschillend beoordelen. De deelnemers zijn 88 normaal ontwikkelende Nederlanse kinderen tussen de 7 en 14 jaar oud (44 meisjes en 44 jongens), die de Empathy Dictator Game uitvoeren, waarbij de deelnemers munten moeten verdelen tussen zichzelf en het target op een foto in een specifieke sociale situatie. De resultaten laten zien dat hoe ouder kinderen ze zijn, hoe empathischer ze reageren. Er blijkt geen verschil te zijn in hoe jongens en meisjes sociale situaties beoordelen, ook niet afhankelijk van het gender van het target. Dit kan verklaard worden doordat veel onderzoeken die dit verschil laten zien worden uitgevoerd door middel van vragenlijsten, waarbij sociale wenselijkheid meespeelt. Naar het verband tussen gender, empathisch vermogen en sociale wenselijkheid zou meer onderzoek gedaan moeten worden. Daarnaast blijkt dat daders van fysieke pijn strenger worden beoordeeld dan daders van sociale exclusie, wat suggereert dat kinderen het makkelijker vinden om zich in te leven in situaties van fysieke pijn dan sociale exclusie. Een mogelijke verklaring hiervoor is dat het herleven van sociale exclusie ingewikkeld en langdurend is (Chen, Williams, Fitness & Newton, 2008) en dat de sociale pijn van een ander altijd wordt onderschat (Nordgren, Banas, MacDonald, 2011).",
Conditional Climate Conflict: How WASH Resource Scarcity Translates into Social Unrest in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Vellage, Luca-Verona",['Dr. Babak RezaeeDaryakenari'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Numerous externalities of climate change are expected to alter the quantity and quality of drinking water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH) services that are vital to human livelihood. Building on the theory of individual deprivation as a motivator for conflict - and the political opportunity structure as its determinant – this study addresses how restrictions in the access of WASH resources affect the incidence of social unrest in first-level administrative regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. The results show, not the absolute percentage of water scarcity predicts protests and riots, but the rate by how much this value changes from one year to another. This is particularly the case in urban areas and countries under semi-authoritarian governance. In view of a changing climate, these findings imply that regions experiencing a rapid deterioration of water resources used for WASH services, coupled with ineffective governance structures, are likely to experience an intensification of protest and riot incidents in the future",

The Impact of Agricultural Intensification on Civil Conflict in Africa,"Münch, Marie",['Dr Babak RezaeeDaryakenari'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research investigates the link between agricultural intensification and civil conflict. Agricultural intensification is a widely promoted solution for food insecurity. However, this research theorizes that agricultural intensification creates disadvantages for the smallholder sector and thus might trigger civil conflict. An OLS, negative binomial, and logistic regression analysis correlate fertilizer-use in 37 African countries to the incidence and count of civil conflicts between 2004 and 2016. The empirical results are mixed and only partly significant. Yet, they indicate agricultural intensification to have a conflictreducing effect. Surprisingly, the outcome of intensification, that is higher agricultural productivity, is significantly associated with an increased risk of conflict. Also, as a mediator agricultural productivity creates a significant and positive indirect link between intensification and civil conflict. Hence, the conflict-enhancing capacity of agricultural intensification might be contingent on whether intensification leads to an increase in agricultural productivity. This opens pathways for future research, where the impact of agricultural productivity on conflict as well as the relation between intensification and productivity should be scrutinized.","['agricultural intensification', 'horizontal inequality', 'grievances', 'civil conflict', 'green revolution']"

Cui Bono? A comparative study on how institutional design shapes far-right environmental behaviour,"Ligtenberg, Raphaël",['Dr. Babak RezaeeDaryakenari'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research paper addresses climate change rhetoric as framed by far-right wing parties. Institutional designs play a part in shaping political party agendas, which are in turn influenced by the specific wants of individuals. Party behaviour therefore impacts voters and wider societal reflexivity. Currently, environmental awareness and far-right wing parties are both on the rise. This paper investigates how far-right parties frame climate-change rhetoric. The hypothesis developed is empirically evaluated across two case-studies. Indeed, this analysis establishes a categorisation for far-right environmental rhetoric and applies it. The empirical evidence supports that far-right parties, in direct democracies, are less likely to address climate change from a government intervention perspective. Instead, far-right parties in direct democracies are likely to use social responsibility rhetoric to address environmental matters. The conclusion reached is that far-right climate-change behaviour differs depending on the democratic model, and is of concern for societal reflexivity, as climate challenges increase.","['climate change', 'far-right wing parties', 'institutional design', 'democratic model', 'party behaviour', 'environmental rhetoric']"
"Rape, Catastrophe, and Socialization: A Cross-National Analysis of Wartime Rape and Natural Disasters","Aguilar Ruiz, Natalia",['Dr. Babak Rezaeedaryakenari'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"How do natural disasters affect the risk of wartime rape in conflict spaces? To date, research has suggested that natural disasters generate conditions of increased vulnerability to interpersonal sexual violence. Meanwhile, influential literature on security studies points to wartime rape as a socialization tool used by armed groups to create intragroup social cohesion. This study attempts to bridge the gap between these two works of literatures through analyzing the dynamics of wartime rape committed by disaster-affected armed groups. Drawing on the sociology of disaster, this paper proposes that the risk of wartime rape decreases when a natural disaster inflicts high costs in a country that is enduring a civil conflict. Empirically, this paper explores this suggested relationship across 179 countries worldwide during the period 1989-2015. Based on quantitative data on natural disasters, wartime rape and armed conflicts, this research finds that natural disasters are a significant predictor for decreases in the likelihood of wartime rape.","['wartime rape', 'natural disasters', 'intra-state conflict', 'disaster sociology', 'rebel groups']"
The impact of conservation of nature and wildlife on conflict,"Reich, Hedda",['Dr. Babak RezaeeDaryakenari'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The protection of nature and wildlife is crucial today. More and more studies, however, speak of violent incidents involving protected areas. To investigate the relationship between protected areas and low-intensity conflict, this article addresses the factors that increase the likelihood of low-intensity conflict when protected areas are established. Widely accepted explanations of rebellion focus on the grievance argument. As with the establishment of a protected area local communities are deprived of land and resources, this article argues that social unrest is likely to increase when protected areas are established. However, building on Ostrom’s “Governing the Commons” theory, intercommunal conflicts as well as social unrest are likely to decrease when a protected area is created. The literature on protected areas and its impact on conflict is vast, but primarily conducted qualitatively. By doing a quantitative study, this article attempts to fill an important gap in the literature. The results of this analysis cautiously suggest that current protected areas in Africa still provoke discontent, as low-intensity conflict increases when the amount of protected areas increases. Future studies are needed to further study the mechanisms that make conflict involving protected areas more or less likely.","['conservation', 'protected area', 'conflict', 'grievances', 'governing the commons']"
The economic structure of a country and its role in climate-conflict nexus,"Grikinyté, Ugné",['Dr. Babak Razaeedaryakenar'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Climate-conflict literature has been growing intensively in the last decade. With a focus on African and Middle Eastern countries, various types of climate variables try to explain divergent natures of conflict. Many different mechanisms were shown as linking the two together. This study aimed to contribute to the literature by investigating the role of economic dependence on the agricultural sector in the relationship between social unrest and changing patterns of temperature and precipitation. It was asked, thus, to what extent does the economic structure of a country mediate the link between climate and social unrest, in the African continent? The large-N statistical analysis was conducted, including all the African countries, with a population of at least a million. Specifically, a negative binomial regression was run for the years from 1990 to 2007. The key finding suggested that the bigger the percentage of agricultural production in GDP is, the more the country is likely to suffer from temperature rise induced social unrest. This suggests that, because of climate change, economic reliance on the agricultural sector is dangerous for the political stability and even security in Africa. It calls for the importance of using planned adaptation techniques and educating the society on climate change and its effects.","['climate change', 'social unrest', 'agriculture', 'Africa']"

The Influence of the Oil Price on the Annual Human Rights: Reports of the United States,"Spitzen, Floris",['Dr. Babak RezaeeDaryakenari'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper analyses the relationship between oil price fluctuations and the level of criticism in human rights reports written by the United States. Previous research has shown that these US human rights reports are not always unbiased. This paper assesses how oil price fluctuations have an influence on these US human rights reports. Based on the realism theory, this paper assumes that since oil plays an important role in the economy of the United States, their government will do whatever is necessary to secure the oil flow. One possible avenue for the US to achieve this, is to adjust the level of critique in these reports depending on the oil price. The empirical findings of this paper suggest that oil price fluctuations do play a role in the US human rights reports. Based on the case study of Saudi-Arabia, in years when the oil price is high, there is less criticism in the US human rights reports towards Saudi-Arabia. Consequently, the conclusion of this paper is that there is a negative correlation between the global oil price and the criticism in US human rights reports.",

Are political systems influencing climate policies? A comparative analysis of the United States and Brazil,"Renhas, Lucile",['Dr. Babak RezaeeDaryakenari'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Climate change is unequivocal and leaders are starting to understand that taking environmental measures is imperative. In reaction to the rise of global protests, marches, and strikes over the climate, governments are promising and implementing different policies. This paper aims to understand how the type of electoral system influences the effectiveness of climate policies. This particular relationship has not received enough attention in academic researches. Thus, this analysis is using political economy theories on the relationship between electoral systems and trade policies and transpose them to climate policies. Those theories are applied to compare two cases: The United-States and Brazil. The focus of the paper is on the measures taken after the 2015 Paris Agreement. This research analyzes both of their climate policies, promises, budget, and measures to evaluate which electoral system is more effective. According to those theories, Brazil should have more effective climate policies because it has a proportional system. The analysis shows that this hypothesis cannot be refuted.",
"Ethnicity: A Domain of Increasing Hostility: The link between ethnicity, violent conflict, and environmental scarcity.","Kock, Kendra",['Dr. Babak RezaeeDaryakenari'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The world experienced a rapid increase in the global population of forcibly displaced people over the past decade. Borders are becoming increasingly artificial, establishing various modes of conflict diffusion. One mechanism that gained numerous attention in the conflict diffusion literature is population displacement and its numerous implications for receiving states. With climate change presenting itself as a serious threat to developing communities, it is likely that this will exacerbate xenophobic sentiments and heighten group identities towards additional resource users (Homer-Dixon, 1991). This may even incite violent mobilization if presented with pre-existing ethnic tensions. Hence, this study investigates whether, and under what circumstances, ethnicity may play a role in violent conflict as a result of environmental scarcity. Using the most similar systems design, this paper compares the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Tanzania, which have experienced the same influx of Hutu refugees between 1994 and 1996, resulting in low levels of conflict in Tanzania, but the First Congo War. By exploring the similarities and differences between the two cases, it became evident that ethnicity mediates the link between environmental scarcity and violent conflict through the presence of rival ethnic groups.",

The effect of multispecies probiotic supplementation on interoception in healthy individuals - A mechanism that could alleviate depression and anxiety?,"Merker, Maximilian","['Steenbergen, L.', 'Fried, E.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Research indicates that probiotics, specific strains of beneficial bacteria, are beneficial against anxiety and depression. There are indications that a potential mechanism behind this might be that probiotics alter interoception and the way we respond to our body needs, which is reflected in interoception. Both critically influence anxiety and depression. Objective: The present study aimed to test whether administering probiotics over a period of four weeks increases the degree of interoception and adaptive responding to body needs in healthy individuals. Also, anxiety and depression were measured. Confirming an increase in the degree of interoception and adaptive responding would show that probiotics trigger a mechanism that reduces anxiety and depression. Design: The study was set up as a randomized, tripleblinded, placebo-controlled within/between subject (placebo versus probiotics), pre- and postintervention assessment design. 89 healthy participants without diagnosed mood or anxiety disorders, aged 18-35 years, received multispecies (diverse strains) probiotics or placebo supplementation over four weeks. In the pre- and post-intervention, degree of interoceptive awareness, adaptive responses, depression, and anxiety. Results: There were no significant changes on any measure, but one unexpected decrease in adaptive responding for the probiotics group. Conclusion: It cannot be concluded that probiotics increase the degree of interoceptive awareness and adaptive responding. Moreover, the results suggest that anxiety and depression are not influenced by probiotics in a healthy sample. However, insights from other research suggests that the effect might be stronger in a depressed and anxious sample. Further research is needed to see whether probiotics might affect interoception and adaptive responding differently in depressed and anxious individuals.",

"The relationship between deforestation, economic development and violent crime in the region of the Amazon rainforest","Korteweg, Tobias",['Dr. Babak Rezaeedarykenari'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Within the research field that concerns itself with deforestation, the socio-economic consequences of deforestation are largely understudied. This paper aims to contribute to help filling this gap by examining the role that deforestation plays in mediating the relationship between economic development and violent crime. In doing so, this paper takes on a quantitative approach, conducting a cross-national analysis of the countries in the Amazon region. The economic development-deforestation-violent crime argument is developed through the individual examination of the theory and literature on each of the associations. The expectation is that economic development will lower the amount of deforestation, which will in turn lower the amount of violent conflict. The main finding is that the empirical analysis provides no support for the economic-development-deforestation-violent crime argument as hypothesised in this paper. However, the findings do support the notion that economic development has an adverse effect on violent crime and deforestation. Due to the methodological limitations of this paper the main implication that this research paper has is that more research is needed in order to investigate the relationship that deforestation has with economic development and violent crime.",

However, the understanding of the disorder remains incomplete. Recently, antibiotic use has been associated with the onset of mood disorders. It is assumed that microbiota-gut-brain interactions are partly managed by the immune system. Accordingly, this study aimed to clarify the correlations between antibiotic-induced microbial dysbiosis, cognitive reactivity to sad mood (CRSM), and concentration of the antibody secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA). Participants, which finished an antibiotic treatment within the past three months (n = 47), were compared to control participants (n = 60). Participants’ CRSM was measured using the Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity (LEIDS-R). Antibody levels of salivary sIgA were investigated by obtaining saliva samples from the participants. Results indicated that antibiotic use was not associated with remarkable differences in sIgA concentration or depression sensitivity, i.e. CRSM. However, based on exploratory observations the preliminary idea of antibiotic use resulting in sex-specific responses was developed and is proposed valuable to be investigated in future research. Moreover, it was examined if antibiotic use can be considered a moderator in the relation between sIgA concentration and CRSM. Antibiotic use did not display a moderating role and CRSM was not predicted by sIgA concentration. The findings within this study were limited by a reduced dataset of sIgA concentrations. Ultimately, in contrast to the hypothesized outcome antibiotic-induced microbial dysbiosis was not associated with a decreased sIgA concentration or increased depression sensitivity of healthy individuals within this study. To clarify the correlation between the microbiota-immune-brain axis, antibiotic use, and mental health future research is needed.","['antibiotic use', 'depression sensitivity', 'cognitive reactivity to sad mood', 'secretory immunoglobulin A', 'microbiota-immune-brain axis']"

This research aims to analyse the impact of environmental forced migration within countries on the likelihood of violent conflict in Africa. This quantitative study expects to find a positive relationship between environmental migration flows and violent conflict through two conditional effects, being political institutions and past conflict. It is hypothesised that democratic states are better in mitigating conflict than non-democracies and that hybrid regimes experience more conflict caused by migration flows than both authoritarian and democratic regimes. Moreover, it is expected to observe that countries that have previously experienced conflict or currently experience ethnic, religious, or other social divisions are more vulnerable to the onset of new conflict. After conducting the statistical analysis, the empirical results support the theoretical prediction regarding the conditional impact of democratic and authoritarian regimes, but hybrid regimes appear to experience more violent conflict than authoritarian regimes. Moreover, the results appear to be insignificant regarding past conflict experience.",

The Environmental Causes of Conflict,"Groot, Jasper M. de",['Dr. Babak RezaeeDaryakenari'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the two decades since its initial proposal at the United Nations, the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) has received increasing criticism. Launched against the emergence of ‘blood diamonds’, the persistence of violent conflict in diamond producing and exporting countries points towards a failure of the scheme and its participants. This calls for a renewed examination of the occurrence of conflict in participants to the scheme. This paper explores the relationship through the lens of a state capacity theory and the trade of ‘peaceful’ diamonds. Two sets of negative binomial regressions test country-level effects of diamond production, exports, and price, on annual conflict data. Annual public data is retrieved from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) database and KPCS participant reports. After examining results from a sample of thirteen countries in the region of sub-Saharan Africa, the paper finds evidence for slight reductions in aggregate conflict and fatalities in two out of three predictors. Furthermore, the results include a set of evaluated hypotheses and statistical values that can guide future research and governance towards a broader understanding of the impact of the diamond market on conflict.",

Behaviour change techniques in parenting interventions for at-risk and non-risk groups: A meta-analysis.,"Cazalet, Asya","['Vermeer, H.', 'Veek, S. van de']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Lower quality parenting has been shown to influence the development and maintenance of various child emotional, behavioural and physical health problems. Parenting interventions aim to promote positive parenting behaviours through education and practice, in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of negative child outcomes. It has been suggested that various family, child, and sociodemographic risk factors (such as low socioeconomic status) can impact how successful a parenting intervention is. However, there is little research into how intervention techniques can be adapted to these various risk groups. This study examined two hypotheses. The first hypothesis was that the at-risk group would receive Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) on the social-emotional domain more often than the non-risk group. The second hypothesis was that use of the BCTs on the social-emotional domain would lead to a more significant positive change in parenting behaviour when applied to the at-risk group, as opposed to when they were applied to the non-risk group. Data extraction was conducted on 70 studies providing a parenting intervention, and information such as BCTs used, risk of bias, and group condition (risk vs non-risk) was collected. The first hypothesis was examined using a chi-square test of independence and found no significant associations between the BCTs in the social-emotional domain and group condition. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the moderator variables of the second hypothesis. The analyses found no moderator effect for the type of group on any BCTs in the social-emotional domain and parental behaviour outcomes. The implications of these results suggest that currently the techniques used in parenting interventions are not being adapted to various groups. In addition, more in-depth research is needed, particularly with a focus on defining the at-risk group more precisely.",

The current research is designed to gain insight into the behaviour that parents show when they play with their child with gender stereotyping toys that ""match"" with the child's gender or not. The main question is: “Do fathers and mothers differ in their first reaction to toys during free play in a gender-conforming or gender-non-conforming situation with their son or daughter in the age of 4 to 6?” For this study 144 parents were videotaped in a free play situation with their child. The parent-child dyads received a box with gender-non-conform toys followed by a box with gender-conform toys to play with. The order in which mother or father first played with the child was counterbalanced. They were given 5 min. to play with each box. The positive initial reaction of parents to the toys was measured via video-observations. Mothers had a more positive initial reaction to toys than fathers regardless of the child's gender. In addition, parents' responses (both mothers and fathers) were generally more positive in gender-conforming play situations than in gender-nonconforming play situations. In conclusion, parents did apply gender socialization in gender stereotyping play situations because they responded less positively to toys that do not ""match"" with the gender of the child, but they did not treat girls and boys differently.",

Political Trust in Low Urbanized Netherlands,"Nieweg, Henk","['Castenmiller, P.', 'Otjes, S.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Political trust is seen as a requirement for democratic regimes to function well. In the Netherlands, polling data indicates that trust is lower in less densely populated provinces, while remaining high nation-wide. This study aims to identify if living in less urbanized - low population density - areas in the Netherlands have lower levels of political trust, and if so look at potential explanations. I investigate the two most specific levels of the framework by Norris (2011, 2017) of political trust: trust in regime institutions as well as trust in incumbent office-holders. All analyses were performed on four waves of data from the DPES (2006 - 2017). After controlling for education, religion, gender and age, urbanization did not improve the prediction of political trust in either level. One remarkable result was that education and age had opposite influences in trust in regime institutions versus trust in incumbent office-holders. These differences demonstrate the value of Norris’ framework: the type of relation between an underlying factor and political trust may depend on the type of political trust considered.","['political trust', 'dutch politics', 'urbanization', 'trust in regime', 'institutions', 'trust in incumbent office-holders']"

Trade as adaptation: A critical discourse analysis of the environment-migration nexus in the Netherlands,"Buijs, Jelle",['Dr. Nem Singh'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The ways in which actors conceptualize and communicate about the environment-migration nexus is fundamental in world politics. The contemporary discourse on the relationship between migration and the environment is predominantly manifested within an adaptation framework. The Netherlands is, because of its reputation in adaptation, a unique case to analyze the ‘politics of causal claims’ with regard to the environment-migration nexus. By conducting a critical discourse analysis on policy documents and websites, this paper contributes to the literature on political ecology by examining how and why the relationship between migration and the environment is conceptualized in the discourse of the Dutch government. This analysis reveals that in the discourse of the Dutch government, a discursive subject has been created that is deemed to migrate in the light of environmental change. Exporting Dutch expertise in adaptation is presented as the solution to the ‘future threat’ of climate-induced migration. A paradigm shift within the neoliberal framework of Dutch development policies allowed adaptation to become instrumentalized as a business case to tap into emerging economies abroad. Future research could therefore shed light on whether a ‘trade as adaptation’ narrative exist or whether the Netherlands is a sui generis entity.","['critical discourse analysis', 'development cooperation', 'environment-migration nexus', 'political ecology', 'the Netherlands']"
Ecuador and the Discursive Struggle Over Buen Vivir: Limits to an Emancipatory Project,"Makris, Jelto",['Dr. Nem Singh'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Ecuador's constitution of 2008 has gathered worldwide attention for its progressive outlook. The constitution adopted Buen Vivir (good living), a concept rooted in the Andean indigenous social movements, as the leading principle of the state. Scholars have called Buen Vivir a potential 'alternative to development': it redefines the objective of national planning as achieving harmony between nature, society and individuals, as opposed to narrowly-defined improved material wellbeing. Nonetheless, critics claim that the term has turned into a guise for new developmentalist state practices. This thesis assesses how a radical new discourse such as Buen Vivir evolves once confronted with the structures of the state and the constraints of society and economy. Drawing on Critical Discourse Analysis, it analyses how the framing of Buen Vivir in the speeches of Ecuador's presidents has limited its transformative potential. Furthermore, it illustrates how gaps between discourse, state practices and constitutional values have rendered the emancipatory meaning of Buen Vivir ambiguous.","['Buen Vivir', 'Post-development', 'Discourse', 'Social Transformation', 'Ecuador']"
Civil Society and the Future of Rare Earths: Explaining the outcome of the anti-Lynas movement in Malaysia,"Medina Aldana, Paula",['Dr. Jewellord Nem Singh'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The aim of the thesis is to explore the largest environmental movement in Malaysia’s history – the anti-Lynas movement – through a case study analysis. The campaign emerged as a response against the construction of the Lynas Advanced Material Plant (LAMP), a rare earth refinery plant in West Malaysia. The anti-Lynas movement argued that the opening of the facility would have negative environmental and health consequences due to the lack of proper waste management facilities for radioactive components such as thorium and uranium. Despite having scientific evidence and political support within the Malaysia also internationally, the movement was unable to stop the operations of the largest earth refinery plant in the world. The thesis draws on resource mobilization theory and political opportunity structures to explain the outcome of the movement. The objective of the thesis is to analyze the reasons why the movement failed to stop the construction and the operations of the rare earth facility. The results of the thesis argue that the anti-Lynas movement had the necessary resources to emerge and contest the LAMP facility. However, the political context of Malaysia did not allow for the movement to influence the legislation of LAMP.","['anti-Lynas movement', 'environmental movement', 'rare earths', 'political opportunity structures', 'resource mobilization theory', 'social movement theory', 'Malaysia', 'Southeast Asia']"
The characteristics of protesters: A research into Burkina Faso's 2014 protests,"Suurd, Daniek","['Demarest, L.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper investigates whether participants in the October 2014 protests in Burkina Faso were a cross-section of the population, using social movement theory. For previous Burkinabe protests, qualitative research has shown that the protests were representative of society. Using data from Afrobarometer Round 6, a logistic analysis is conducted to research whether a quantitative analysis leads to the same conclusion. The analysis shows that each social movement perspective has a small explanatory effect on protest participation, indicating that protest participants indeed represented a cross-section of the population. Community membership was associated with higher participation in the October 2014 protests. This suggests that protestors were brought together and mobilized through communities, even though protestors had different motivations to participate. One motivation that protestors shared, was the aversion to the amendment to the constitution and possible re-election of president Blaire Compaoré.",
Social Policy expansion in Latin America: The case of Colombia,"Kemenes van Uden, Paul",['Jewellord Nem Singh'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Political context, economic bonanza, and political ideology explanations have been the focus in the literature in attempting to account for social policy expansion in Latin America. Yet, there is lack of in-depth analyses for several countries that present different ideologies and nevertheless expanded their social policies between the 1990 and 2000s. In light of this empirical gap, this study investigates the mentioned explanations of how social policy is expanded in a new case, the health-care system in Colombia. Through a single case analysis and using the theory-testing process-tracing method, this study finds that the explanations revolving around the economic bonanza and political competition do not satisfactorily explain the expansion of the health-care system, while the perspective on political ideology provides the best alignment. This study shows that in Colombia, despite it being a traditionally rightwing country, the left-had a major role in the expansion of the healthcare system.",

Economic Development Strategies: The Underlying Challenges of Achieving Gender Equality,"Theys, Anne",['Dr. Nem Singh'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The goal of developing countries is to achieve the economic status of “developed”. As many strategies aiming to achieve that stage revolve around economic procedures, this research rather takes a social and a more inclusive approach to the matter. As previous studies find that gender equality has a positive impact on economic growth, it has become part of the development agenda of numerous developing countries, including the Republic of Indonesia. Nevertheless, although academic work has established the existence of a major correlation between female educational attainments and the participation of women in the workforce, this paper finds Indonesia to be an outliner. Indeed, as the country successfully increased its economic rates and female educational attainments, only 0,1% increase of the female participation in the labour force has been recorded between 1998 and 2014. Examining the causes of why women’s economic participation has stagnated in Indonesia, this research uses a process tracing method of analysis to examine two gender policies. This research finds traditional customs – viewing women’s role as biological rather than on the labour force – to be the main explanation for this phenomenon.",

The Promise of Inclusiveness: Free Prior and Informed Consultation in Post-neoliberal Bolivia,"Conte, Veronica",['Dr. Jewellord Nem Singh'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The achievement of an international legal framework acknowledging that states should seek free, prior and informed consultation (FPIC) of indigenous people for any development project directly affecting them is considered a milestone in the protection of indigenous rights around the world. Drawing from theories of participatory democracy, the creation of mechanisms for direct decision-making at the local level, such as FPIC, has the potential to enhance the inclusiveness of previously exclusionary governance arenas. However, criticisms have also arisen concerning governing elites’ employment of FPIC to delimit indigenous participation to permitted spaces, inhibiting its counter-hegemonic potential. This thesis analyses the extent to which FPIC mechanisms have enhanced the inclusiveness of resource governance in Latin America. The research is carried out through the study of Morales (2006-2019) administration in Bolivia, considered as the region’s most radical socio-political terrain. In particular, the implementation of FPIC into national law and the consultation process of the Tacana II community in the Bolivian Amazon are the objects of this study. The thesis argues that the impact of FPIC on inclusiveness is ambiguous. Two main reasons have been identified for this: the national economic dependency on natural resources extraction and the judicialization of indigenous claims.",

China’s Role in the Age of Resource Nationalism: The Case of Venezuela,"Klaasse, Emma",['Dr. Jewellord Nem Singh'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Chinese investment in Latin America has increased significantly during the recent commodity boom of 2002 to 2012. At the same time, this period was accompanied by a wave of resource nationalism in resource-abundant states in the region. This research aims at explaining Latin America’s increased dependence on Chinese capital, in the light of resource nationalism. Drawing on the case of Venezuela during the Chávez period (1999-2013), this paper uses process-tracing to uncover the role that China played in Venezuela’s development model, which led to the existing Sino-Venezuelan relationship. A combination of speeches, government documents, and newspaper articles was analyzed to reveal the underlying causal mechanisms. The research provides an extensive discussion of Venezuelan resource nationalism and the characteristics of Chinese capital during this period. Building on the established context, I argue that the profit optimization strategy of the Chinese government in the resource sector made it particularly attractive for Venezuela to rely on, as it provided the government with a reliable source of credit and development aid to invest in socio-economic policies. These findings contribute to the existing literature on Sino-Latin American relations, as they show that China does not only serve as a market for Latin America’s commodities. Instead, China is deeply embedded in the region’s resource-led development strategy.",
Beyond Growth: Poverty Reduction Through Agricultural Policies in Ethiopia,"Pampararo, Cecilia",['Jewellord Nem Singh'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Africa has experienced sustained aggregate economic growth over the past two decades, effectively disproving the “good governance” agenda. However, this has not been matched by a substantial reduction in poverty and inequality, thus raising concerns about the reach and sustainability of the current development. On the basis of the success in Southeast Asia, Henley and van Donge (2013) identify the agricultural sector as the central actor for a broad-based growth with substantial poverty reduction. They argue that the African inability to generate a growth that is inclusive can be traced back to the absence of a bundle of pro-market and pro-rural policies. Based on this theory, this paper analyses the relationship between agricultural policies and poverty reduction on the case study of Ethiopia, through qualitative analysis. The thesis argues that while poverty reduction in Ethiopia is resulting from a pro-rural/pro-poor public spending along with relative macroeconomic stability, it is slowed down by land grabbing by foreign investors.",
The Middle-Income Trap: Social cleavages in the Case of Mexico,"Drakouli, Elpida",['Dr. Jojo Nem Singh'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research paper attempts to contribute to the literature by filling the knowledge gap of sociopolitical explanations in the Middle-Income Trap debate. The objective of this paper is to highlight how and why economic and political elites in Mexico influence the implementation of policies to escape the Middle-Income Trap. The research question attempted to answer is: How and why do social cleavages influence the Middle-Income Trap in Mexico? The argument is two-fold. The one side is that economic elites, meaning domestic and foreign firms, have different interests from each other that prevent the formation of coalitions from cooperating and upgrading the necessary implementation. The outcome of this incoordination is demonstrated through data on engineer graduates, high-tech exports and research and development. Both domestic and foreign businesses do not have the incentive to initiate policies that would boost the economy to innovate. The second part of the argument is that political elites and the domination of the political field by domestic companies divert resources away from the implementation of upgrading coalitions through clientelistic politics and corruption. This paper has utilised both previously gathered quantitative and qualitative data to highlight how and why political and economic elites do not implement the necessary policies. The article establishes a partial link between economic and political elites and the middle-income trap. However, the findings cannot be conclusive as more extensive research needs to be done to account for the limitations. Further research is required to both establish a precise link between elites and the MIT but also to propose suitable coalitions for Mexico.",

Het volunteer’s dilemma: De invloed van communicatie en het hebben van broers en zussen op de keuze om te coöpereren,"Deltrap, Roos","['Kwaadsteniet, E. de']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Er is onderzoek gedaan naar het volunteer’s dilemma. Hierbij is gekeken naar de invloed van communicatie en het aantal broers en zussen dat iemand heeft op de keuze om te coöpereren. Hier is nog maar weinig onderzoek naar gedaan en door veranderingen in gezinsgrootte en manier van communiceren was nieuw onderzoek nodig. Gezinnen worden kleiner en communicatie gaat steeds vaker via online medium. De onderzoeksvragen luidden als volgt: ‘Wat is de relatie tussen het aantal broers en zussen op de keuze om te coöpereren in het volunteer’s dilemma?’, ‘Wat is de relatie tussen het hebben van communicatie voorafgaand aan de taak op de keuze om te coöpereren in het volunteer’s dilemma?’ en ‘Is er een interactie van het aantal broers en zussen en het hebben van communicatie op het wel of niet coöpereren in het volunteer’s dilemma?’. Allereerst is een literatuurstudie uitgevoerd. Hieruit kwam naar voren dat mensen uit een gezin van twee personen het meest coöperatief zijn (Falbo & Polit,1986). Communicatie zou ook een grote invloed hebben op de mate van communicatie. Mensen voelen zich meer verbonden met de groep en kunnen zich identificeren waardoor ze eerder zullen coöpereren (Balliet, 2009). Hierdoor werd verwacht dat er eventueel een interactie is tussen het aantal broers en zussen en communicatie op het coöpereren. Na de literatuurstudie is een experimenteel onderzoek uitgevoerd met 129 Amerikaanse participanten. Het onderzoek werd uitgevoerd via de website mTurk. Op deze website werd de participanten gevraagd een taak uit te voeren waarbij ze geld konden verdienen. Participanten die coöpereerden kregen minder geld dan participanten die niet coöpereerden. De experimentele groep kon voor de taak vijf minuten met elkaar communiceren via een chat. Ze wisten nog niet wat de taak zou zijn zodat ze hierover niet konden overleggen. De controlegroep had geen communicatie vooraf. Na het uitvoeren van het onderzoek is een analyse gedaan via een logistische regressie. Hieruit kwam naar voren dat geen van de onderzoeksvragen significant verschil liet zien. Aantal broers en zussen op coöperatie: B = .022, S.E. = .122, Wald(1) = .033 en p = .855. Communicatie op coöperatie: B = .151, S.E. = .419, Wald(1) = .130 en p = .718. Aantal broers en zussen en communicatie op coöperatie: Bbroers en zussen*communicatie = .119, S.E.broers en zussen*communicatie = .179, Wald(1)broers en zussen*communicatie = .441 met pbroers en zussen*communicatie = .507. Wellicht had dit te maken met het aantal participanten per groep. Zo waren er maar twee personen met vijf broers en zussen. Daarnaast waren de participanten random verdeelt over de variabele communicatie. Per toeval zaten alle participanten met vier broers en zussen in de groep met communicatie. In volgend onderzoek wordt geadviseerd om ongeveer gelijke groepsgroottes te creëren bij de variabele aantal broers en zussen zodat deze beter met elkaar te vergelijken zijn. Daarop aansluitend kan gekeken worden naar de invloed van directe communicatie. Dit zou een sterker effect geven dan online communicatie. Een volgend onderzoek zou ook in verschillende landen uitgevoerd moeten worden om te bepalen of dit andere uitkomsten geeft. Participanten in dit onderzoek waren Amerikanen, wellicht dat andere landen andere uitkomsten geven door verschil in normen en waarden.",

De prosocial heeft gesproken. De invloed van communicatie en sociale waarde oriëntatie in het vrijwilligersdilemma.,"Witte, Sanne","['Kwaadsteniet, E. de']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Weinig is bekend over welke factoren de keuze van het individu beïnvloeden om wel of niet te coöpereren in het vrijwilligersdilemma. Eerder onderzoek naar andere sociale dillema’s onderstreept het effect van communicatie en sociale waarde oriëntatie op de keuze van het individu om te coöpereren. Dit onderzoek richt zich daarom op de invloed van communicatie en de mate van een prosociale persoonlijkheid op de keuze om te coöpereren binnen het vrijwilligersdilemma. De 126 geanalyseerde participanten met een leeftijdsrange van 21 tot en met 74 jaar zijn gerekruteerd via de website MTurk en ingedeeld in groepen van drie personen. Binnen de controleconditie werden de participanten na het vaststellen van hun sociale waarde oriëntatie score, met behulp van de SVO Slider Measure vragenlijst, doorgeschakeld naar de instructies met betrekking tot het vrijwilligersdilemma. Hierna volgde de vraag of zij wilden coöpereren in het vrijwilligersdilemma of niet. De participanten in de experimentele conditie kregen, voorafgaand aan de instructies van het dilemma, de taak om hun mede-groepsleden beter te leren kennen middels een chat. De resultaten van de binaire logistische regressie laten zien dat er geen significant effect is van communicatie op coöperatie in het vrijwilligers dilemma. Daarentegen is de mate van een prosociale persoonlijkheid wel significant van invloed op coöpereren. Exploratief bleek dat leeftijd ook een significant effect heeft op de keuze om te coöpereren. Kortom, bij een hogere mate van een prosociale persoonlijkheid en een hogere leeftijd neemt de kans toe dat het individu zich aanbiedt als vrijwilliger.",

Measuring the verbal transmission of stranger fear from parents to offspring: The role of behavioral inhibition,"Kros, Sarah","['Aktar, E.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,The verbal pathway of anxiety is regarded as the main mechanism through which parents transmit fear to their children; however this pathway has not been explored in the context of stranger anxiety. This experimental study investigated the influence of threat and safety messages regarding strangers in the parent-to-child transmission of fear and considered the moderating role of children’s temperamental anxiety dispositions of behavioral inhibition (BI). The children included in this study were 4 to 6 years old (n = 68). Parents were asked to deliver manipulated verbal information (threat versus safety) to their children in reference to strangers whom later evaluate their children’s social performance. Children’s fear beliefs were measured prior to the social performance task. BI scores were assessed via online questionnaires and the children’s fear belief scores were assessed by administering a Fear Beliefs Questionnaire (FBQ). The children significantly reported more fear beliefs regarding the strangers assigned to the threat condition compared to the strangers assigned to the safety condition. This effect was not moderated by child BI. No significant overall association was found between the parents’ reports of BI and the children’s fear beliefs. Our study contributes to the emerging literature on the parental verbal pathway as an important mechanism through which children acquire fear by addressing stranger anxiety as another form of fear that can be verbally acquired. Future research should investigate samples of children with high BI levels to see whether this group is more influenced by their parents’ comments than a typically developing sample.,

Influence of parental verbal information on observed child anxiety and avoidance of strangers,"Nugter, Nadina","['Aktar, E.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental disorders in children and it runs in families. The most prevalent way to transmit anxiety from parent to child in daily life is through verbal communication of threat information. The way that verbal transmission of information affects the behavior of children, and the possible moderating effect of parental anxiety, has not received much attention in scientific papers. Using an experimental manipulation, this study investigated how parental threat and safety information about strangers affected the observed behavior (avoidance and anxiety) of children towards these strangers. Children (aged four to six) were exposed to threat and safety information by their fathers or mothers regarding two judges. Children then completed two social tasks with the judges, one performance and one interaction, during which their behavior was observed. Parental anxiety was measured using the SCARED-A questionnaire. Results showed no significant effect of verbal safety and threat information on the observed anxious and avoidant behavior of children. Results also showed that parents’ general anxiety levels did not moderate the effect of the verbal comments. Thus, can be concluded that verbal threat and safety information seems to have no effect on behavior in children towards strangers, nor can behavior be predicted from parental anxiety.",

Het vrijwilligersdilemma is een specifiek soort sociaal dilemma. Een vrijwilligersdilemma ontstaat als er één of meerdere personen zich moeten opofferen voor het groepsbelang. De pro-sociale handeling van de vrijwilliger komt de hele groep ten goede. Interessant hierin is om te kijken naar factoren die coöperatie bevorderen en welke factoren van invloed zijn op coöperatie. Binnen dit onderzoek zijn communicatie en sociale waarde oriëntatie in verband gebracht met coöperatie. Er is gekeken naar de invloed van communicatie binnen een groep voorafgaand aan het vrijwilligersdilemma. Daarnaast is de sociale waarde oriëntatie van de participanten vastgesteld en afgezet tegen de coöperatie. Door middel van een experiment is de coöperatie bepaald. Vanuit de resultaten kan geconcludeerd worden dat communicatie geen significant effect had op coöperatie in het vrijwilligersdilemma. Sociale waarde oriëntatie had daarentegen wel een significant positief effect op coöperatie. Participanten met een hogere mate van een pro-sociale sociale waarde oriëntatie coöpereerden significant vaker.,
Children's heart beating hard: The effect of parent-to-child verbal transfer of threat and safety information on children’s heart rate response to strangers,"Meuche, Annika","['Aktar, E.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"With a lifetime prevalence of 13,0% in the USA, social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a highly prevalent disorder (Stein et al., 2017). In order to provide proper prevention more research is needed on the factors leading to social anxiety in children. Apart from the genetic’s component, environmental factors can contribute to the parent to child transmission of SAD (Wong & Rapee, 2016). One environmental factor is the verbal information provided by parents to their children. Lang and Levis (1970) proposed that verbal information acts on physiological factors such as heart rate (HR). Yet, little is known about how verbal information affects heart rate in children in a social situation. The current study investigated the effect of verbal information provided by parents on the heart rate of children in a social situation while taking into account the effect of behavioral inhibition as a moderator. The sample consisted of 51 typically developed children aged 4-6 years. In the current study parents provided their children with safety and threat information about strangers. Heart rate of the children was measured during an interaction task with the strangers linked to the threat and safe information. The results did show that the nature of the verbal information paired with the strangers did not differently influence child HR responses to these strangers during the social interaction tasks. Moreover, there was neither a moderation effect nor a main effect of the covariate behavioral inhibition. This shows that in the social situation the verbal information given by their parents was not strong enough to trigger a different hear rate response in children",

Additionally, this study considered the moderating role of social anxiety levels of the parent who provided the information to the child on the effect of verbal threat information. The sample consisted of 68 American children ranging from age 4 to 6. These children were told they had to perform for, and interact with two different judges (strangers). The children were provided with threat or safety information about the judges by their parent. Fear beliefs regarding each judge were assessed after the manipulation using an adapted version of the Fear Beliefs Questionnaire. Results indicated that verbal threat information from parents resulted in significantly higher fear beliefs in children about these judges than when safety information was provided. Parental general social anxiety did not moderate this effect. This is the first study to show that parental verbal threat information is effective in triggering higher fear beliefs about strangers in 4 to 6-yearold children than safety information. Thereby this study provides insight into the parent to child transmission of social anxiety via verbal threat information.","['Social anxiety disorder', 'verbal information', 'social referencing', 'environmental learning mechanism', 'parental anxiety disorders']"

The verbal transmission of social anxiety from parents to children,"Jonckheere, Hannah de",['And the potential moderating role of behavioral inhibition'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is highly prevalent around the world, and often develops in childhood. Transfer of SAD from parents-to-children occurs both by genetic transmission as by environmental transmission, namely by social learning. The verbal information pathway is known as one of the social learning pathways for fear. There are multiple studies on the acquisition of animal fears via the verbal pathway, but studies on social fears are limited. Therefore this study aims to investigate the verbal information pathway as a learning mechanism of social fears. Besides, a proposed risk factor for the development of SAD, behavioral inhibition (BI), is included in the current study as a potential moderator. Methods: The study sample consisted of 68 dyads, with children aged 4-6. Parents provided safety and threat information about two strangers to the children. Fear beliefs were compared between safety and threat condition. In addition, a questionnaire measured children’s BI tendency to study both as a covariate and directly in relation with fear beliefs. Results: When children received threat information fear beliefs were significantly higher compared to when children received safety information about the stranger. There was no interaction effect or main effect with BI. Conclusions: We conclude that 4-to-6-year old children are influenced by parents verbal information about strangers in such a way that threat information compared to safety information creates more fear beliefs. Besides, moderation by BI was not significant in the community sample used in the current study.","['Verbal transmission', 'Fear', 'Social anxiety', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'BI', 'Parent', 'Child']"

In dit onderzoek is gekeken naar twee factoren die mogelijk invloed kunnen hebben op de keuze of iemand zich aanbiedt. Ten eerste is onderzocht of communicatie voorafgaand aan de beslissing invloed heeft op het wel of niet aanbieden als vrijwilliger. Ten tweede is onderzocht of de positie binnen het gezin invloed heeft op de keuze of iemand zich aanbiedt als vrijwilliger. De factor communicatie is onderzocht door een deel van de mensen vooraf kon chatten met de groepsgenoten. De tweede factor werd onderzocht, door te vragen of de participant de oudste, jongste of middelste was. Waarna werd gekeken of mensen uit een van die groepen zich vaker aanboden. Uit de resultaten is naar voren gekomen dat communicatie vooraf geen invloed had op of iemand zich aanbood als vrijwilliger. Wel is er naar voren gekomen dat de oudste zich vaker aanbood als vrijwilliger dan de jongste.",

Evidence of the parental verbal transmission on social fear beliefs and the moderating role of BI is missing. We examined the effect of threat versus safety parental verbal transmission on child fear beliefs of strangers, and the moderating role of BI in this pathway. The typical development sample consisted of children (N = 68) between 4-6 year with a caregiver. The BI was measured with a parent report questionnaire. In the experiment the parent provided the safety and threat information for two strangers, creating two conditions. After the manipulation the fear beliefs of the child was measured for both strangers. The first analysis revealed a significant difference of the parental verbal information on fear beliefs in the condition threat versus safety. The second analyses revealed no significant moderating role of BI in this effect. The findings suggest that threat versus safety parental verbal transmission contribute to the social fear cognitions of the child of strangers. The BI temperament of the child seems not to make the child differential suspectable to the parental verbal transmission.",

Previous research into corruption has mainly focused on defining corruption and the consequences of corruption. This field has broadly overlooked the relationship between political corruption and armed conflict onset, which is this thesis’ focus. The theory is built on separate fields of study often studied in isolation; the consequences of corruption and the causes of armed conflict onset. Compared to previous research, this research has a more comprehensive approach, by incorporating insights of multiple theories, exploring the positive and negative direct effects of political corruption on conflict onset, and by including a large timeframe and data for 205 countries. Using a logit model on data from 1984 to 2017, this thesis finds that political corruption increases the chances of armed conflict onset. Unequal distribution of resources, rights and freedoms may lead to conflict as marginalised groups experience grievances. Political corruption also damages political trust which results in pressures on state legitimacy. Governments, perceived less legitimate, may find it hard to mediate between competing groups which increases the chance of armed conflict onset.",

State violence against protesters is an important topic of research, considering its potential to result in many civilian deaths. Even so, the literature on state repression and dissent does not explain variations in the lethality of state violence against protesters. Instead, existing studies only differentiate between violent and non-violent state responses to protests. I address this shortcoming by testing the theory that the lethality of state violence is influenced by protestergenerated concession costs. To examine my argument, I analyze state responses to Iranian protest events in 2009 and 2019. In 2019, state violence against protesters was significantly more lethal than in 2009. I compare both events using a process tracing method. The analysis shows that in 2019, protester demands were more radical and more recurrent, and protesters were more violent. This confirms that concession costs influence the lethality of state violence against protesters. These results provide substantial insights into the dynamics of protests and repression, which are useful for scholars, activists, and policy makers.",

Frustration in Isolation: A Network Perspective on Anger During a Pandemic,"Aigner, Patrick","['Fried, E.', 'Will, G.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background. Anger is experienced in various mental disorders. Based on increased mental health problems in students and the adversity of the coronavirus pandemic, (1) the relations between anger, depression, anxiety, stress, and being occupied with COVID-19 were explored. As traits predict interpersonal events and states identify events under situational control, it was investigated (2) if baseline trait anger predicted average state anger during a period of self-isolation to test if anger levels were determined by general tendencies, and (3) if trait and average state anger differed within and between men and women to test if the groups were affected differently by situational factors. Methods. (1) Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data was collected from 79 undergraduates from Dutch universities, with surveys prompted via smartphone four times daily for 14 days. Contemporaneous, temporal, and between-subjects networks were computed. (2) In a multiple regression analysis, average EMA state anger was regressed on trait anger while controlling for gender, age, depression, anxiety, and stress. (3) A mixed-design analysis of covariance included standardized type of anger as a within-factor and gender as a between-factor while controlling for differences in mental health. Results. (1) Contemporaneously, anger was positively associated with irritability, feeling nervous and anhedonia. Temporally, anger and irritability positively predicted each other. Anger positively predicted difficulty to relax and itself. Between-subjects, anger was positively associated with irritability and feeling nervous but negatively with being occupied with COVID-19. (2) Trait anger did not significantly predict average EMA anger, whereas the covariate stress did. (3) Despite significantly lower trait anger compared to women, men displayed significantly increased average EMA anger in relation to their trait levels. Trait and average EMA anger did not differ within women. Conclusion. EMA anger was persistently related to stress, less likely to be the source or recipient of activation compared to other constructs, not strongly linked to trait, and increased in relation to trait levels only in the male group. Differences between our healthy participants and a clinical sample encourage an investigation of anger in phase transitions towards psychopathology and its potentially adaptive effects in healthy individuals.","['network analysis', 'anger', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'stress', 'COVID-19']"
Lost in conversation? Social activities and their impact on missing data in ecological momentary assessment.,"Totland, Jonas","['Fried, E.', 'Will, G.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Missing data is a problem all research should strive to understand and minimize. This study focuses on missing data in ecological momentary assessments (EMA), and specifically what impact voluntary, in-person social activity has on it. This study consisted of a baseline assessment, an EMA assessment which was conducted for two weeks with four measures per day, and a post assessment. Missing data, in this study, is defined as missed notifications or beeps in the EMA. Overall missing data was 16.1%. Participants indicated their average voluntary, in-person social activity per day, the time of week they were most socially active, and the time of day they were most socially active on weekdays and on weekends. All these questions were asked in a baseline assessment prior to the 2-week EMA data collection. The questions asked in the baseline assessment were tested for correlation with each other as well as with the amount of missing data. Voluntary, in-person social activity had the highest correlation with missing data (r = -.196, p = .074). A significant negative correlation was found between the voluntary, in-person social activity and time of week with most social activity variables (r = -.278, p = .011). The regression analysis with the four social activity items as the independent values and missing data as the dependent value was non-significant (F(4, 79) = .941, p = .445). It is important to note the time and context of this study, as the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have affected results in some capacity.",

Student Mental Health and Self-Efficacy as Predictors of Compliance in Ecological Momentary Assessment,"Busch, Anika","['Fried, E.', 'Tollenaar, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Although ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is increasingly used in clinical and research settings due to its high ecological validity, low compliance rates still hinder its full fruition. Inconsistency in which predictors interfere with EMA compliance persists. As students frequently suffer from mental health problems, we as a Bachelor project group conducted an EMA study measuring mental health and related behaviors in 84 Bachelor students of Dutch universities via a smartphone application. The study consisted of a baseline assessment, a two-week-long EMA with four measurements per day, and a post-assessment. My goal was to explore whether mental health and self-efficacy predict EMA compliance and whether self-efficacy mediates the relationship between mental health and compliance? I computed a multiple linear regression model and mediation analysis with bootstrapping using the program “PROCESS” (Hayes, 2009) on IBM SPSS Statistics, version 24. The dependent variable was compliance, derived from the percentage completed EMA surveys, and the independent variables were mental health and self-efficacy at baseline, where the latter ran as the mediator between mental health and compliance. I added age and gender as covariates. Results depicted a mean EMA compliance rate of 83.9% with minimal time variations. No predictor was significantly related to EMA compliance (R 2 = 0%). The mediation analysis showed non-significant direct and indirect paths with compliance. This demonstrates that students generally complied well with the EMA and did not systematically miss EMA reports based on their mental health and self-efficacy, which is promising for future EMA use.","['EMA', 'missing data', 'compliance', 'self-efficacy', 'mental health', 'regression']"
Does perceived stress influence the amount of missing data? Analysis of missing data in ecological momentary assessments.,"Micale, Alice","['Fried, E.', 'Will, G.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The present study aims to investigate a possible relationship between perceived stress and missing data. Respondents were asked to answer a series of questionnaires (Baseline, Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and post assessments) over the course of a 2-week period. One hundred undergraduate students between 18 to 48 years of age comprised the sample. The respondents were asked to complete four EMA questionnaires per day, for each day of the duration of the study. The results analysed were composed of the data from 84 of the respondents: 19 males, 64 females, and one person who did not identify their gender. The level of perceived stress was collected at baseline for each individual, and the evolution of stress level was analysed in relationship to the cumulative percentage of the amount of missing data; throughout the EMA period. To explore this relationship, two hypotheses were tested: stressed individuals have more missing data and women have more perceived stress in relation to the levels of missing data. The regression analysis between the level of perceived stress, gender and missing data held a non-significant p-value of 0.861. Concerning the exploratory research question: multiple stressors such as the burden created by the questionnaires and COVID-19 pandemic showed an influence on missing data. A positive relationship between stress created by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and missing data was found with F(5,78)=2.335, p= .050 indicating the impact of the pandemic on the respondent's compliance. In conclusion, the obtained results did not show any significant results between stress, gender and missing data. Consequently, both the hypotheses were rejected. Interestingly, the stress caused by the current pandemic might have influenced the amount of missing data. A peculiarity of the study was the co-occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic that might have influenced the results, and the level of perceived stress of the respondents. In the analysis and interpretation of the results it is necessary to take into consideration this particular situation and the impact on each individual’s daily life.","['Perceived stress', 'missing data', 'Ecological momentary assessments', 'COVID-19']"
"Prescribing the Outdoors: What is the effect of time spent outdoors on stress, anxiety and depression in undergraduate students?","Kusal, Agnieszka Anna","['Fried, E.', 'Tollenaar, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background The World Health Organization has classified stress as “the health epidemic of 21st century”. Extensive studies were launched to assess its effects on the economy and employees’ performance. However, working adults are only one of many social groups affected. Stress starts much earlier in our lives and definitely affects many university students. While a little stress is actually beneficial for learning, prolonged and uncontrolled pressure can cause devastating and long-lasting effects. Since stress is an inevitably part of the university life and cannot be eradicated altogether, there is an urgent need to offer students effective and attractive means to reduce its adverse effects. An extensive body of research has already proven that time spent outdoors is a powerful factor in maintaining our physical and mental wellbeing. This paper investigates in particular the effects of time spent outdoors on stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms experienced by university students. Method The Ecological Momentary Assessment data collection method was used with a group of 84 university students over a period of two weeks. The participants were asked questions about their mental health and time spent outdoors. A questionnaire was prompted 4-times per day. A dynamic network analysis was used to show the results and consequently the correlation between the constructs (anxiety, stress, and depression) and time spent outdoors. To investigate the dynamics between the variables, contemporaneous network, temporal network and between-subject networks were estimated. Results The results demonstrate two things. First, there is more positive associations between Outdoors and mental health in the temporal network (predictions over time), as compared to the contemporaneous network (association within same timeframe). Second, all mental health constructs have proven to be interconnected, with the strongest connection indicating that time spent outdoors could potentially lead to a decrease of the feeling difficulty to relax or having nothing to look forward to. Conclusion The broad implication of the present research is that time spent outdoors does have a positive effect on mental health of university students. However, its effects are not immediate and manifests itself over time, which in our case was a timeframe of 3 hours duration.",

Methods: A total of 84 university students, mostly Dutch and German, were assessed with a baseline and a post-assessment questionnaire as well as an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). They were asked four times per day during a period of 14 days about how much time they spent listening to Music, two questions about Depression (“Anhedonia” and nothing to look forward to “Future”); two questions about Anxiety (“Worry” and “Nervous”); and two questions about Stress (difficulty to “Relax” and “Irritability”). Analysis: These results were analysed with Network Models of contemporaneous partial correlation and temporal ones, where the variable is compared to the next assessment point. Results: No significant associations were found between time spent listening to music and any of the assessed mental health variables in both contemporaneous and temporal network models. Null Hypotheses are not rejected Discussion: Potential reasons for the null-findings are discussed, such as measurement levels and unforeseen circumstances, suggesting improvements to the current study design to test in future work whether there is a meaningful relationship between music and mental health.",

Previous research has shown that the quantity and quality of social interactions are associated with the development, course and severity of mental disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Less is known about the psychological effects of social contact during a pandemic. Method: The current study investigates the dynamic associations among offline social interactions, depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in undergraduates from a Dutch university (N=79; 75.95% female; MAge =20.37) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) was used for the data collection. A short online questionnaire was prompted via smartphone four times a day for two consecutive weeks. Multilevel vector autoregressive models were used for the network analysis and centrality indices were calculated. Results: We found significant dynamic associations among the duration of offline social contact and depression symptoms only. The absence of pleasure was associated with less offline social interactions, and vice versa. Having nothing to look forward to was predictive of less offline social contact three hours later. Social contact scored the lowest on centrality indices in our sample. Conclusion: Altogether, we found the duration of offline social contact to be partially related to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results, strengths and limitations are discussed. Examining the dynamic associations among mental health and social contact can provide novel insights into the development and maintenance of mental health issues.","['social interaction', 'mental health', 'pandemic', 'COVID-19', 'ecological momentary assessment', 'network analysis', 'centrality indices']"

"COLONIAL RULE AND HEALTH INSTITUTIONS IN WEST AFRICA: Chiefs, Chefs, and WHO Rankings: Examining the Effects of Direct and Indirect Rule on West African Health Institutions","Lampiri, Lydia",['Dr. Frank de Zwart'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The right to health is vital. Therefore, its promotion should be in the best interest of all governments. Yet, not all health provision is the same, even amongst similar countries. Senegal and Sierra Leone are two West African countries with low levels of Human Development, and high levels of poverty. Nevertheless, Senegal has, according to the World Health Organisation’s Ranking of Health Systems, the 58th best health system worldwide, while Sierra Leone has the worst, at 191st. By asking the following question: Why did Senegal Perform Better than Sierra Leone in the World Health Organisation’s Latest Health Systems Rankings? This thesis aims to discover the factors leading to two countries with several similarities between them having such a stark difference in terms of their health systems. Through a review of theory and literature, this research explores the long-term effects of direct and indirect colonial rule. The goal here is to discover if the institutions built by the colonial powers affect the way modern-day states operate. The results indicate that indirect rule has led to Sierra Leone’s state fragmentation and institutional inefficiencies, while direct rule established ties between France and Senegal which undermine Senegal’s sovereignty. As a result, this thesis concludes that colonial institutions are a factor in the operations of modern-day governments and could therefore explain the difference in the results of Senegal and Sierra Leone’s positions in the WHO Rankings of Health Systems.","['Direct rule', 'indirect rule', 'political institutions', 'WHO Health Rankings', 'Sierra Leone', 'Senegal']"

Intergenerational transmission of social anxiety and the role of behavioral inhibition and parental social anxiety,"Arnold Rozemuller, Ineke","['Aktar, E.', 'Blom, J.D.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Parental verbal communication of threat is regularly associated with (sub)clinical symptoms of anxiety in children. This experimental study aims to investigate the effect of parental threatening and safe information about strangers on the fear and avoidance behavior of their child, in a non-clinical sample. It is also examined whether behavioral inhibition, parental social anxiety and their interaction lead to more socially anxious behavior of the child. Method: A sample of 68 children between 4 and 6 years old performed a social performance task in front of two strangers. Before the task, the parent was asked to transfer verbal threatening or safe information about the strangers to their child. After the task, the strangers interacted with the children separately from each other. Results: Exposure to verbal expression of threat about strangers did not change the anxious or avoidant behavior of children towards those strangers. However, the interaction of behavioral inhibition and parental social anxiety was significant, such that higher levels of behavioural inhibition in combination with less social anxiety in parents were significantly associated with more social anxiety towards the stranger about whom children receive safe information. Conclusion: Intergenerational transmission of social anxiety occurs when children who have a higher behavioral inhibition in combination with less socially anxious parents receive positive information about a stranger. It is concluded that the intergenerational transmission of social anxiety is dependent on multiple variables concerning the parents and the child.",

Dit onderzoek heeft een poging gedaan de toename in de adolescentie van deze twee paradoxaal lijkende gedragingen, risicogedrag en geefgedrag, te verklaren. Hierbij is gekeken of aardig worden gevonden door klasgenoten een mediërende factor was. 520 participanten in de leeftijd van 12-17 jaar hebben vragenlijsten ingevuld over risicogedrag en aangegeven welke klasgenoten zij aardig vonden door middel van sociometrie. Om geefgedrag te meten is een Dictator Game uitgevoerd waarin deelnemers munten verdelen tussen zichzelf en een klasgenoot. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat er sprake is van een negatief verband tussen risicogedrag en geefgedrag. Dit betekent dat adolescenten die meer risicogedrag rapporteren, gemiddeld minder weggaven aan een klasgenoot in de Dictator Game. Dit onderzoek heeft laten zien dat het belangrijk is om de uitkomst van het risicogedrag te weten omdat deze invloed kan hebben op het geefgedrag. Hoe aardig adolescenten gevonden worden door klasgenoten blijkt geen mediërende factor te zijn.",

The 20 February Movement in Morocco: An Institutional Explanation for Political Continuity,"Berger, Eva",['Dr. Frank de Zwart'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In early 2011, the 20 February Movement took place in Morocco in the wider context of the Arab Spring. The movement in Morocco did not lead to thorough change or governmental over-throw, as it was the case in other North African countries. Morocco’s political institutions re-mained stable after a quick response of the government and monarchy. This thesis is conducted by relying on institutional theory and the use of qualitative research methods to explore the following research question: Why has the 20 February Movement in Morocco led to the con-tinuation of political institutions and not initiated governmental change? The results show that Morocco’s authoritarian political institutions remained stable and widely unchanged because of the legitimacy of the monarchy and the king as head of state. Even though the constitution was reviewed as a response to the protests that demanded democratisation, the position of the king was not questioned. Historical, religious, social and political factors legitimise the position of the king, which make him a source of stability for the regime and decreases the likelihood of experiencing political conflict and violence.",

Framing by Radical Right Populist Parties in the Dutch Lower House,"Ladestein, Ralph","['Castenmiller, P.', 'Otjes, S.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The 2015 European migration crisis was caused by turmoil in Sub-Saharan Africa, civil war in Syria and civil unrest in Central Asia. This caused a massive influx of migrants into the European Union. This influx of migrants fuelled the rise of radical right populist parties. In March 2016, a migration deal was struck between the European Union and Turkey to control this influx of migration. For this thesis, we want to examine to what extent rhetoric frames are used by the radical right populist parties within the Dutch Lower House by examining the European migration crisis. We will examine what kind of frames the spokespersons of the radical right populist parties used to highlight and how they use framing the context of the migration crisis. One would expect that the frames used by the popular parties in the Dutch Lower House change as the severity of the crisis changed and the consequences nationally shifts during the crisis. In order to do this, I will use a framing theory where we will be able to perform a qualitative discourse analysis that provides us with analysable results. As a specific case study, we will perform the discourse analysis of the parliamentary debates on the European migration crisis, as we would expect that radical right populist parties would make more prominent use of radical right populist frames as the migration crisis touches some of the core elements of radical right populist characteristics. We will analyse debates on migration before, during, and after the migration crisis. We will combine this framing theory with radical right populist theories to be able to identify the frames we have to analyse. Thereafter, we will use the transcripts of debates on migration, which we will analyse and finally we should be able to present some conclusions.",

The current study aims to examine whether four burnout-engagement cluster groups could be identified based on burnout and engagement dimension scores, and to investigate whether these four cluster groups differed significantly in terms of job demands and job resources. Methods. A cross-sectional study, involving 877 professionals working at the Emergency Department, was carried out in 19 hospitals in the Netherlands in 2017. Burnout was assessed by the Utrecht Burnout Scale, work engagement with the 9-item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, and job demands and job resources by the Leiden Quality of Work Questionnaire for nurses and doctors, and the Quality of Labor Questionnaire. Results. K-means cluster analysis revealed that four groups could be identified with varying levels of burnout complaints and engagement. However, CH-index showed that two main clusters, the burnout and engagement group, were best at describing the data. Subsequent MANOVA analysis revealed that the groups differed in terms of job demands and resources. Additionally, it was found that the engaged group experienced high resources and low demands compared to the burnout group with low resources and high demands. Conclusion. This study found evidence for a distinction between the burnout-engagement cluster groups regarding the burnout and engagement dimension scores. Furthermore, the findings provide confirmation that the burnout and engagement group significantly differed in terms of job demands and job resources. Future research should focus on various perceptions of Emergency Department professionals and longitudinal research.","['Burnout', 'Work engagement', 'Job demands', 'Job resources', 'Work characteristics', 'Cluster analysis', 'Healthcare professionals', 'Emergency Department']"

Verwachtingseffecten op motivatie: De effecten van leerkrachtverwachtingen op de motivatie van leerlingen uit verschillende sociaaleconomische status groepen,"Manintveld, Lisanne","['Denessen, E.', 'Stroet, K.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek is onderdeel van het onderzoeksproject Onderwijskansen (OK) Venray, waarin gezocht wordt naar verklaringen voor kansenongelijkheid in het basisonderwijs binnen de gemeente Venray. In dit onderzoek ligt de focus op de verwachtingen die leerkrachten hebben van hun leerlingen, hoe leerlingen deze verwachtingen ervaren en wat deze verwachtingen voor effect hebben op de motivatie van de leerlingen. Daarnaast is er gekeken naar de verschillen in relatiesterktes tussen motivatie, de leerkrachtverwachtingen en de ervaren verwachtingen bij leerlingen uit verschillende sociaaleconomische status (SES) groepen. Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd met behulp van een schriftelijke vragenlijst die op zes basisscholen in de gemeente Venray is afgenomen. Uiteindelijk voltooiden 348 respondenten hun deelname aan het onderzoek. De resultaten tonen aan dat leerkrachten significant lagere verwachtingen hebben van leerlingen uit een lage SES-groep. De leerlingen uit een lage SES-groep ervaren zelf ook significant lagere verwachtingen van hun leerkrachten. De gemiddelde motivatie is gelijk bij de verschillende SESgroepen. Daarnaast bleek dat de werkelijke leerkrachtverwachting een significante relatie heeft met de ervaren leerkrachtverwachting, maar dat deze relatiesterkte niet significant verschillend was bij de verschillende SES-groepen. De ervaren leerkrachtverwachting heeft een significante relatie met de motivatie van de leerlingen, maar wanneer er per SES-groep naar deze relatie gekeken wordt is deze relatie significant bij de leerlingen uit de hoge SES-groep en niet bij de andere SES-groepen. Ten slotte heeft de werkelijke leerkrachtverwachting geen relatie met de motivatie van de leerlingen. Toekomstig onderzoek zou zich kunnen richten op het ontrafelen van de causaliteit van deze relaties door longitudinaal onderzoek te doen. Tevens zou men kunnen nadenken over hoe de werkelijke leerkrachtverwachting overgedragen wordt aan de leerlingen, dus hoe komen deze ervaren verwachtingen in de perceptie van de leerlingen terecht. Om dit te bereiken kan het gedrag van leerkrachten onderzocht worden.",

This poses the question of “What is the impact of the 2010 Kraken en Leegstand legislation on the squatter movement in the Netherlands?”. I hypothesize that the squatter movement adopted infrapolitical tactics to fly under the radar of the state which in turn allows the movement to continue operating despite repression. I conducted an in-depth interview with a member of the squatter movement and, moreover, analyzed the 2016 policy report of the Kraken en Leegstand legislation and the Squatter Yearbook 2018 to answer the research question. I found that the squatter movement was greatly impacted by the 2010 legislation regarding its organization, tactics and identity. Furthermore, the movement indeed adopted infrapolitical means to survive. These findings are significant for the study of new social movements and political opportunity structures because it demonstrates that infrapolitics are a viable strategy for new social movements in unfavorable political opportunity structures. This introduces a novel way to think about the relationship between state repression and social movements in social movement theory.","['infrapolitics', 'new social movements', 'political opportunity structures', 'squatting.']"

Attachment as a determinant factor for the formation of selfconcept positivity and empathy during adolescence,"Petkidou, Kalliopi","['Spaans, J.', 'Zanolie, K.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The study aimed to examine attachment as a determinant factor for the formation of self-concept positivity and empathy during adolescence. Attachment refers to the quality of relationship with a primary caregiver in the beginning of life and it affects an individual’s emotional and physical development throughout lifespan. It consists of two core dimensions, anxiety and avoidance. Attachment has been found to affect the formation of self-concept positivity, meaning how positive one perceives his own self and the formation of empathy, meaning the ability to experience someone else’s emotions. Yet, research regarding how those concepts are linked during adolescence is scarce. We expected that higher scores in attachment anxiety lead to lower scores both on self-concept positivity and empathy. Likewise, we expected that higher scores in attachment avoidance would again lead to lower scores in both dimensions. Lastly, we investigated potential interaction effects among the variables. The sample consisted of 160 adolescents between 11 and 21 years old. To assess their level of self-concept positivity, participants performed an fMRI examination. Their attachment type was measured by the ‘Experience in Close Relationships’ questionnaire and their levels of empathy were assessed by the ‘Interpersonal Reactivity Index’. The data was analysed by the statistical program IBM SPSS 25. The results suggested that attachment anxiety and avoidance were not related to the levels of self-concept positivity during adolescence. However, both of them were found to be negatively related to the levels of empathy. Finally, the results revealed no interaction effect.","['attachment', 'adolescence', 'self-concept', 'self-concept positivity', 'empathy']"

The extent to which group characteristics of a terrorist organization influence its sustainability after decapitation, is tested through the composition of a group profile, containing group characteristics of IS and an analysis of Country Reports on Terrorism by the United States government – illustrating IS in light of sustainability indicators from 2011-2019. The analysis enables the adoption of the main hypothesis stating that IS’ state of being after decapitation does not depict levels of low sustainability as reports in 2019 indicate that IS is far from being defeated, even after decapitation. The organizational structure characteristic of IS enabled them to disperse and decentralize after territorial defeat as they eliminate the need to render approval from higher ranks through training and information sharing . In addition, group size remained the same after decapitation due to cunning use of social media in recruitment, embedded in their recruitment characteristic.",
Zijn we bang om vervangen te worden door “Serious Games” in de Psychotherapie? Belemmeringen voor het gebruik van Serious Games in de Geestelijke Gezondheidszorg door professionals.,"Egdom, Marloes van","['Mouthaan, J.', 'Molendijk, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Achtergrond: Professionals binnen de Geestelijke Gezondheidszorg in Nederland gebruiken Serious Games nog te weinig. Ondanks dat de effectiviteit van Serious Games gunstig blijken te zijn binnen de psychotherapie. Wat weerhoudt professionals om Serious Games in te zetten? Onderzocht werd wat de attitude was van de professionals ten opzichte van de belemmeringen voor henzelf of de cliënten in het gebruiken van Serious Games. Methode: Doormiddel van een online vragenlijst werden professionals binnen de Geestelijke Gezondheidszorg in Nederland, waarbij zij enige vorm van therapie geven aan cliënten, gevraagd naar hun attitudes omtrent Serious Games. Resultaten: Gebleken is dat bijna een kwart (23.3 procent) van de professionals Serious Games niet willen inzetten. De voornaamste reden hiervoor bleek het hebben van onvoldoende kennis in Serious Games en onvoldoende vertrouwen in de effectiviteit van Serious Games. Daarnaast weerhield het professionals om Serious Games te gebruiken voor cliënten met complexe problematieken. Conclusie/discussie: Omdat professionals aangeven te weinig kennis te hebben van Serious Games, wordt geadviseerd om trainingen te ontwerpen om professionals nog beter te informeren over het gebruik van Serious Games binnen de Geestelijke Gezondheidszorg in Nederland. Ook wordt geadviseerd nader onderzoek te doen naar de professionals met een negatieve attitude van Serious Games.","['Serious Games', 'Professional', 'Negatieve attitude', 'Belemmeringen', 'Onvoldoende kennis']"
Patients’ requirements for implementation of serious games for mental healthcare,"Mac Donald, Brian","['Mouthaan, J.', 'Molendijk, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Introduction: The aim of this study was to find out how to increase usage of serious games in mental healthcare through analyzing requirements for implementation of (former) patients. Methods: An online survey was conducted measuring (former) patients’ (n=82) attitudes towards usage of a serious game, requirements for implementation, and media usage. Attitude towards usage of a serious game groups, gender groups, and high and low frequency media usage groups were compared against each other on the requirements for implementation in categories of being necessary or not. All data was analyzed through a chi-square test in SPSS. Results: 75.6%(n=62) of the sample had a positive attitude towards the usage of a serious game. Patients with a positive attitude towards the usage of a serious game valued easy access and applicability(χ2 (1)=12.313, p<0.001), and entertainment of the game (χ2 (1)=5.22, p=.022) more than patients with a negative attitude towards the usage of a serious game. Women valued availability through insurance as significantly more necessary than men (χ2 (df(1)=5.838, p=.016). There were no differences between high and low media usage groups on their requirements for implementation. Discussion: Differences on requirements for implementation were found between genders, and patients with positive and negative attitudes towards usage of serious games. The main limitation of this study is that (former) patients were recruited through convenience sampling. Future studies should focus on experimenting whether implementing these requirements increase usage of a serious game in mental healthcare.",

New Media as the New Medium: Do Media Usage and Gaming Experience Impact Professionals’ and Clients’ Attitudes Towards SG in Mental Health Care?,"Pfeiffer, Leonie","['Mouthaan, J.', 'Molendijk, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Despite increasing evidence for the effectiveness of Serious Games (SG), research and the implementation of such digital measures in mental health care lags behind. Insights into attitudes and their influencing factors for professionals and clients of mental health care are assumed to facilitate the implementation and development of SG. Objective: This study aimed to gain a greater understanding of the attitudes of professionals and clients of mental health care towards SG and factors that influence (media usage, gaming experience) and moderate that relationship (age, gender). Method: A cross-sectional online survey with a quantitative study design was conducted with professionals (N = 166) and (former) clients of mental health care (N = 154). Two independent samples t-tests were conducted to study the influence of media usage and gaming experience on attitude towards SG, whereas four ANCOVAs were applied to examine the moderating effects of age and gender. Results: Media usage and gaming experience did not significantly influence the attitude towards SG in both samples. Also, age and gender did not significantly moderate the studied relationship. Conclusion: The factors media usage and gaming experience and the moderators age and gender do not contribute to a greater understanding of the attitude towards SG. Following these variables cannot facilitate the implementation and development of SG in mental health care. Based on the chosen sampling and measurement methods, the collected data was not considered representative of the studied population and statistical analysis were conducted with reduced power.","['Serious Games', 'Mental Health Care', 'Attitudes', 'Professionals', 'Clients']"
From interest to implementation: Optimal design for maximizing implementation and adherence of Serious Games in mental health care,"Lehtonen, Sanni","['Molendijk, M.', 'Mouthaan, J.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Serious games for mental health purposes is a young but rapidly growing concept, however, implementation in clinical practice lags behind. Knowing the characteristics and attitudes of the users, mental health professionals, will aid in seeking the optimal design and more efficient implementation. Objective: We wanted to gain more insight on what professionals want from the games, and if knowledge about games or practicing different therapeutic modalities is related to attitude on serious games. Method: We surveyed 123 MPHs via a cross-sectional online survey about technology usage, gaming knowledge, and attitudes towards serious games. Data were analysed using a t-test, chi-square test, exploratory factor analysis, and an ANOVA. Results: The results showed that overall interest to implement serious games with their own clients was high (75.6%), and perceived benefits outweighed perceived disadvantages, but current implementation rate was very low (.8%). The biggest reason for not wanting to use serious games was lack of knowledge (14.6%). Knowledge about gaming was significantly positively correlated to overall attitude, and with willingness to implement. There was no significant relationship between any specific therapeutic modality and the overall attitude towards serious games, which contradicts results from previous studies. Conclusion: Knowledge about games increases the attitude and willingness to try serious games with clients. Most mental health professionals reported to have beginner knowledge, thus educating them about (serious) gaming could help with implementation and adherence. More research is needed to map out why the professionals who are interested have not yet tried serious games. User-centred design (UCD) should be widely implemented when developing serious games for mental health purposes.","['Serious games', 'mental health', 'implementation', 'e-health', 'attitude']"
