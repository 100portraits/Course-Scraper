Decreasing Abortion Rights in Poland and the EU Response,"Andel, Bente van","['Gils, E.E.A. van']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"European integration is under pressure. There is increasing disagreement between Member States (MS) on topics such as immigration, the European currency, sovereignty and for the first time since its foundation, a member state has left the European Union (EU). In these debates, it often comes down to the discussion on competences and sovereignty. Is the ultimate power for the sovereign state or for the supranational institutions? This thesis examines the overlapping competences between healthcare (national) and the protection of human rights (supranational). Based on the case study of abortion rights in Poland, it discusses which factors play a role in this debate and what the EU's response and competences are. According to the EU, access to abortion is part of basic sexual and reproductive rights of women and strict abortion laws violate this. However, the EU also recognises that healthcare arrangements, and thus abortion, lie with the sovereignty of MS, as agreed upon in the treaty. Thus, the EU has no legal ground to tackle the stricter abortion legislation. It does, however, hold the power of responsibility by persuading MS to adhere to women's sexual and reproductive rights. This thesis studied the critical junctures in time from the Polish accession in 2004, the Lisbon treaty in 2009, and the rise of the PiS party in 2015, and analysed the changing positions of Poland and the response of the EU. The results showed that given its sovereignty on healthcare, the EU has no legal basis to tackle Poland's stricter abortion laws. To influence this area beyond its competences, the EU increasingly condemns Poland for violating the Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHS) agreements and sponsors projects that increase SRHR awareness and provide geographical access to SHRH services.","['Abortion', 'Poland', 'EU', 'Competences']"

El enfoque del tema es la medición de la Capacidad de Estado de la República Dominicana, aplicando un modelo, fruto de la reelaboración del trabajo de Queiroz Cunha, Pereira y de Ávila Gomide (2017), al Sector Eléctrico del estado caribeño desde su privatización y capitalización en la década de los 1990. Según el modelo considerado, los aspectos que serán medidos son la Especialización, la Autonomía, y la Cohesión de las instituciones reguladoras del sector. La Especialización es la preparación y la capacidad de los miembros y funcionarios de las instituciones, que tienen que ser elegidos por ser competentes; la Autonomía es la posibilidad de las instituciones de tomar e implementar decisiones en su campo sin la influencia de los gobiernos o de los otros actores; y la Cohesión es la capacidad de las instituciones para evitar redundancias y contradicciones.","['capacidad de estado', 'regulación', 'governance', 'instituciones reguladoras', 'sector eléctrico', 'República Dominicana', 'privatización', 'estado regulador']"

The Effects of Microfinance Programs for Poverty Alleviation in Relation to Income and Asset Building in Thailand and Indonesia,"Zon, Justin van","['Hadiprayitno, I.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"“The idea of microfinance emerged around the 1970s as a revolutionary new way to alleviate poverty in developing countries. Microfinance delivers financial services – such as loans and saving services – to the poor, who are traditionally financially excluded from conventional financial institutions. However, the debate whether the efforts of MFIs have been successful is almost just as old as the concept itself, and the results remain ambiguous. This thesis aims to add to the extensive body of literature by providing an in-depth comparative case study of the experiences and effects of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Thailand and Indonesia. The research is focused on poverty alleviation in two key areas, (i.) household income generation and (ii.) household asset building. The hypothesis is that although MFI provides great opportunities for people in lower-income classes to access credit, it has done little to practically alleviate poverty in Thailand and Indonesia. In the final analysis, this thesis will argue that this hypothesis is false, and argues that microfinance institutions in Thailand and Indonesia have been effective in increasing household income and therefore poverty alleviation. However, the effect of microfinance on asset building is ambiguous. Therefore, the study revealed that the effect of microfinance on asset building for poor households should be further studied.” Key words: microfinance; poverty alleviation; Village Fund program; Islamic microfinance; Thailand; Indonesia.","['Microfinance', 'poverty alleviation', 'Village Fund program', 'Islamic microfinance', 'Thailand', 'Indonesia.']"

‘[...] maar we vinden het meer dan ooit belangrijk dat iedereen begrijpt waarom we doen wat we doen.’: Een stijlanalyse van tekstkenmerken die een negatieve invloed hebben op de begrijpelijkheid van de toespraken uit persconferenties over het coronavirus in Nederland.,"Sluijs, Coen van der",['Henrike Jansen'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Een paar dagen na de persconferentie van 28 september stonden er in het NRC twee oordelen over het taalgebruik van de persconferentie: ‘Moeilijke taal is rem op effectieve coronabestrijding’ (Altenburg & Punselie, 2020) en ‘Coronacrisis is nu ook een communicatiecrisis’ (Redactie NRC, 2020). Naar aanleiding onder andere deze media-oordelen, die negatief waren over de begrijpelijkheid van het taalgebruik in de toespraken van persconferenties over het coronavirus, is het begrip begrijpelijkheid geoperationaliseerd om de toespraken te analyseren. Een stilistische analyse op taalkundige grondslag is uitgevoerd op toespraken uit twee specifieke persconferenties: 19 mei en 28 september 2020. Verschillende media-oordelen verwezen specifiek naar 28 september, waardoor deze interessant is om te analyseren. Op de persconferentie van 19 mei is geen directe kritiek geleverd, maar bleek na de exploratieronde grotendeels hetzelfde woordaantal en dezelfde potentieel problematische stijlmiddelen te bevatten. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om aan te tonen dat de toespraken op stilistisch niveau aan begrijpelijkheid hadden kunnen toenemen. Dit doel wordt bereikt door het onderbouwen van de media-oordelen met wetenschappelijke inzichten. Dit zijn inzichten in de wijze waarop bepaalde formuleringskeuzes een negatieve bijdrage leveren aan de begrijpelijkheid van een tekst. In een stijlanalyse op taalkundige grondslag worden er op systematische wijze verbanden gelegd tussen stilistische middelen op microniveau en globale indrukken op macroniveau. De centrale vraag is hoe de toespraken uit de persconferenties over het coronavirus van 19 mei en 28 september begrijpelijker konden worden gemaakt, afgaande op wetenschappelijke inzichten over begrijpelijk taalgebruik. Om de begrijpelijkheid van de toespraken stilistisch te analyseren zijn vier tekstkenmerken opgesteld: 1) Zinscomplexiteit, 2) Samenhang, 3) Woordmoeilijkheid en 4) Concreet taalgebruik. Deze tekstaspecten zijn opgesteld door gebruik te maken van de media-oordelen over de persconferenties en relevante literatuur over begrijpelijkheid van tekstkenmerken in combinatie met een exploratieronde van de toespraken om na te gaan welke stijlmiddelen uit de literatuur relevant zijn om te analyseren. De stijlanalyse is volledig berust op een kwalitatieve analyse (het interpreteren van stijlmiddelen). Om de betrouwbaarheid en validiteit van het analyse zoveel mogelijk te waarborgen zijn er heldere criteria opgesteld om de stijlmiddelen op te sporen en te analyseren. Een kwantitatieve analyse bleek niet haalbaar te zijn vanwege het ontbreken van een betekenisvol extern vergelijkingspunt. Uit de analyse is gebleken dat de gezamenlijke inzet van de geobserveerde stilistische middelen die tot elk van deze tekstaspecten gerekend konden worden, voldoende aanwijzingen geven om te veronderstellen dat de toespraken uit de persconferenties van 19 mei en 28 september 2020 aan begrijpelijkheid konden toenemen. Op basis van wetenschappelijke inzichten over begrijpelijk taalgebruik en in vergelijking met denkbare formuleringsalternatieven is aannemelijk gemaakt dat bepaalde stijlmiddelen van de toespraken uit beide persconferenties minder begrijpelijk waren. Het is de gezamenlijke inzet van de geobserveerde stijlmiddelen die een negatieve invloed hebben op de begrijpelijkheid van de tekst zonder dat één categorie hiervoor verantwoordelijk kan worden gehouden.","['Begrijpelijkheid', 'persconferenties', 'corona']"

Understanding Refugees’ Conditions in Aegean Hotspots & The Infrastructure(s) that Exist to Support Them: The Case of Chios & VIAL,"Tezapsidis, Elias",['Dr. Brian Shaev'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Syrian Refugee Crisis has, since it happened in 2015, reshaped the face of migration in the European continent, marking various responses to how refugees are perceived and how borders need to be enforced. EU states are expected to protect the geographical borders that fall under their jurisdiction, while simultaneously being confronted with a large influx of refugees. Investigating a refugee camp in VIAL, Chios through oral interviews conducted with workers who are employed there, this thesis will answer: what is the perception of the impact that refugees living in Chios have, and how is that manifested in border management discourse? To successfully do so, the responses of the workers will be analyzed, as a case study to understand refugees' conditions in Aegean hotspots. In doing so, it also explores what infrastructure is needed to help refugees transition towards becoming parts of the societies in which they have arrived: and even what sort of urban planning needs to be altered to make such an existence plausible. The role that various actors play in VIAL, Chios is presented, along with the limitations and pitfalls of what they can do for the populations residing there. Competing narratives on the migration debate are presented, as well as the ambivalent notions of “refugee integration” and “border management.”","['VIAL', 'Chios', 'Refugees', 'Refugee Camps', 'Refugee Integration', 'Local Policy Arena', 'Border Management', 'Urban Challenge']"
"Examining Neoliberalization’s Effects on Mental Health: Empirical Evidence from OECD countries, 1993-2018","Bartsch, Merle","['London, J.D.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In both popular and academic discourse contemporary increases in the prevalence of mental health problems are attributed to neoliberalization. Yet, what neoliberalization entails is often poorly defined, either in highly abstract terms or in a reductionist manner. Its consequence is that the hypnotized association between neoliberalization and negative mental health outcomes remains empirically untested. This thesis advances the debate by contrasting measures of public mental health with measures of firm coordination, the marketization of which signifies neoliberalization within the Varieties of Capitalism framework. Employing statistically tested fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) it is demonstrated that neither causation nor correlation can be observed between neoliberalization and public mental health. Links between other kinds of politico-economic institutional reconfiguration and mental health outcomes could be established, however. Further academic inquiry is required to assess the specifics of these interactions.","['mental health', 'neoliberalization', 'Varieties of Capitalism']"

This thesis will contribute to new directions in the historiography of Dutch Empire by focusing on the Dutch East India Company governors and the narratives they communicated in the so-called 'Memories van Overgave', how these changed between 1700-1750, how these differed between three different regions: Bengal, Ambon, and Ceylon, and what the implications are for the organisational identity of the Dutch East India Company. In order to do so, this thesis employs a new analytical framework that positions the governor in the centre of two different relations: the relation he had to the institute he was a part of, and the relation he had with the proverbial 'other' he encountered. Everything combined, this will show the multi-faceted nature of the governors, the Dutch East India Company, and that the identity of the Dutch East India Company was not static, but flexible and ever-changing.","['Early Modern', 'Dutch East India Company', 'Global History', 'Colonial History', 'Memory Culture', 'Identity', 'Southeast Asia', 'Ceylon', 'Ambon', 'Bengal', 'Colonial Governors', 'Organisational Identity']"
The Increasing Competition of the Asian International Financial Centres: An analysis of the determinants building Shanghai and Seoul,"Broers, Nicole","['Shidiq, A.R.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Asian International Financial Centres (IFC) are growing in importance within the global economy. Increasingly they are becoming the control centres of financial flows and innovation. In particular, the aspiring IFCs of Shanghai and Seoul have remarkably increased in status and competitiveness. This research discusses a possible explanation for their increase in competitiveness. Both cities have large systemic differences from the well-established Western IFCs, as government control and policies have been predominant in the East-Asian region. Nevertheless, they are flourishing in the international financial system based on market mechanism. During the Asian Financial Crisis, Asian centres have undergone many changes and multiple government reform policies have been carried out to enhance the financial sectors. Within this research, the influence of the crisis and changes in the determining factors for competitiveness are scrutinized. The four main determinants constituting an IFC set the parameters for the two case studies of Shanghai and Seoul. The results suggest that the government focus on rapid technological and infrastructural developments have contributed the most to the increase in competitiveness. Moreover, these developments are a part of a shift towards high-end technology industries and services and the overarching government-driven transition towards a knowledge economy.","['Asia', 'Finance', 'Competition', 'Shanghai', 'Seoul']"

Is that Mask also Available in Pink?: The Role of Mask Producing Businesses in Mask-Wearing Normalisation in Japan,"Wit, Merel de","['Cwiertka, K.J.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"By applying the three stages of normalisation process theory, this thesis analyses the contribution of face mask producing businesses in Japan for mask normalisation. It concludes that mask normalisation from the 2000s onwards has mostly been performed by mask producing businesses and that the industry was often aided by governmental support and regulations on mask manufacturing, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analysing governmental influenza preparedness protocols, mask production numbers and mask media articles in the Asahi Shinbun, this thesis claims that the influence of mask producing businesses for mask normalisation in Japan started in the second half of the 20th century. In the second half of the 20th century, the government of Japan shifts from legislating face masks for the general public during health hazards to solely recommending mask-wearing in such events. Along with this emphasis on individual health responsibilisation, from the 2000s onwards, the government places the responsibility for mask promotion, distribution and production during health hazards on the mask producing industry itself. This causes mask businesses to have free range in advertising masks, which ultimately diversifies mask-wearing purposes. Because of this, masks increasingly lose their originally intended health care purpose and so they are often employed as risk rituals. Recently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks in Japan seem to have regained their originally intended purpose.

Nightlife in London and Berlin around 1900: An exploration of imagined and real possibilities,"Weigl, Anselm Jonathan","['Schmidt, A.', 'Bennett, J.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Through a comparative approach, this thesis investigates nightlife in Berlin and London around 1900 by examining both its concrete manifestation as well as its imaginative potential. In doing so, it aims to work out various reasons for similarities and differences between these two metropoles. While there is no lack of literature on metropoles and their entertainment culture, urban nightlife still remains largely untouched even though it is precisely the city at night that marks a different access to various areas of life and, therefore, bares great potential for historical research. This thesis aims to use this potential and tries to show that the insights gained from a topic that at first glance may seem rather mundane can be quite profound. With a focus on the years between 1900 and 1910, the first chapter examines external as well as internal factors of urbanisation as an imperative prerequisite for the emergence of metropolitan leisure industries that created the conditions for new forms of night-time pleasures in the first place. Through a close reading of sources that transgress the line between artistic invention and sociological study, the second chapter discusses entertainment districts at night in both cities as a very specific setting for social encounters by using the concept of heterotopias. The last chapter will work out who the various actors were that tried to shape the contemporary discourse with political or moral agendas.",
"Syracusan Imperialism (431-367 BC) An Analysis of Syracusan Foreign Policy in Sicily, South Italy, and Greece","Lampadiaris, Nikolaos","['Flohr, Miko']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The purpose of this study is to examine the foreign policy of the Greek city-state of Syracuse between the second half of the fifth and the first half of the fourth centuries BC, and in particular from the beginning of the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC, to the death of Dionysius the Elder in 367 BC. This study is specifically focused on ancient contemporary as well as modern perceptions of Syracuse as an imperialist, expansionist power. The study aims to demonstrate that Syracuse was a typical city-state which to a large extent reacted to external events and pursued a limited and modest foreign policy aimed at preserving the city in light of an increasingly unstable political environment, while occasionally taking advantage of unique opportunities to pursue limited expansion. By the end of the study, the reader should be able to discern the bias of ancient authors, understand their motivations, and form a more pragmatic and realistic assessment of Syracusan foreign policy. It will be demonstrated that Syracuse was a typical city-state with limited resources, and well-defined, consistent goals, as opposed to the more adventurous imperialistic and at times opportunistic goals ascribed to Syracuse by authors influenced by Classical Athenian imperialism. It will be shown how and why Syracuse fell short of the exaggerated expectations of friend and foe alike, concerning the city’s capabilities and the role which it was envisaged playing in various regions of the Classical world.","['Syracuse', 'Magna Graecia', 'Imperialism', 'Foreign Policy', 'Ancient Greece', 'Siceliots', 'Italiots', 'Carthage', 'Dionysius I', 'Dionysius the Elder', 'Athens', 'Sparta', 'Peloponnesian War', 'Diplomacy']"

Monika Baár'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Neuroscience has since its institutionalization in the 19th century directed its scientific promise of the discovery of the relationship between the brain and mind and with it the explanation of mental illnesses and disorders to range of political actors. Where neuroscientists in the first decades after the Second World War failed to claim a position of scientific expertise, by the late 1980s the social and political context had changed in their favor with the rise of Neoliberal governance. During the 1990s Decade of the Brain, neuroscience’s promise of the ‘cure for mental illness’ was turned into a national project, first by the Bush administration in the United States and then followed up by nations around the globe. Neuroscientific reductionist explanations of mental illness were so successful because they aimed at and resembled neoliberal discourses on individual responsibility and the inability of governmental interference in the social environment. Where neuroscientists and governmental officials in the first years of the Decade mentioned social factors as causes for mental illness and disorders, by the beginning of the 21th century mental illness had become a ‘no-fault brain illness’, a neurobiological phenomenon without external causes and therefore also solutions. The consequences of this alliance between neuroscience and neoliberalism have been topic of many critical studies in the past decade, yet the Decade of the Brain until now have almost completely been ignored. This master thesis is the first step towards an understanding of the interplay between the local and global dimensions of this Decade and thereby also a step towards understanding the way mental health issues are seen and treated in the present. This understanding at the same time is meant to open up the possibility to imagine much needed change in the future.","['Neuroscience', 'Neoliberalism', 'Science and Politics', 'Scientific Promises']"
Body metaphors of anger in GSL,"Groen, Ingeborg",['Victoria Nyst'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis is a contribution to descriptive work on emotion expression in sign languages. The main purpose is providing a detailed description of anger expression in Ghanaian Sign Language (GSL), as well as placing this description within the framework of anger expression in the languages of the world. Anger is considered a basic emotion, resulting in a discussion about the universality of anger expression. This thesis aims to include sign languages in this discussion, by analysing anger expression in GSL in the context of proposed universals. Multiple data collection methods were applied, among which the usage of movie- and picture stimuli, scenarios containing different types of anger, and storytelling. Six signers of GSL were provided with these stimuli and asked to either narrate the movie, identify emotions, create a story containing expression of anger or act out scenarios. Results showed that GSL has a division, phonologically as well as semantically, between signs at the head and signs at the chest area. Furthermore, anger expression is largely iconic and metaphorical. GSL confirms existing theories about universals, such as the embodiment of anger expression and the universality of anger metaphors. However, GSL does distinguish itself from earlier research on anger expression in its usage of intensifiers. Furthermore, although GSL is based in American Sign Language (ASL), many of the signs belonging to the anger lexicon are unique to GSL. Nonetheless, the two signs most frequently used to express anger are the same in both languages.","['Sign language', 'Ghanaian sign language', 'semantics', 'emotion domain', 'anger expression', 'anger language', 'body metaphors', 'iconicity']"

Eén van de meest beruchte Nederlandse geweldsontsporingen in deze periode is het bloedbad van Rawagede, een massa-executie in een dorp gelegen in West-Java. Rawagede speelde een belangrijke rol in het publieke debat over Nederlandse oorlogsmisdaden. Zo stelde de rechtbank Den Haag in 2011 de Nederlandse staat aansprakelijk voor de gruweldaden in de Javaanse kampong. Dit was de eerste keer dat de Nederlandse staat wettelijk aansprakelijk werd gesteld voor misstanden tijdens de oorlog met Indonesië. Wat er precies gebeurd is in Rawagede is echter nog steeds onduidelijk. Volgens eerdere onderzoeken naar het bloedbad maakte de Nederlandse krijgsmacht tussen de 150 en 433 slachtoffers. Van dit aantal zouden er tussen de 20 en 120 zijn geëxecuteerd. Vrouwen en kinderen werden gespaard. Alhoewel Rawagede frequent het onderwerp is geweest van academisch onderzoek, geldt dat niet voor de verantwoordelijke eenheid. Dit was het 3e Bataljon 9e Regiment Infanterie, kortgezegd 3-9 RI, een dienstplichtig landmachtbataljon van de 7 December Divisie.

Lingua Franca or Euro-English? A comparative analysis of variability in English discourse,"Kooreman, Samantha","['Foster, A.A.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines whether the conditions are right for a codification of a Euro-English. English has emerged as Europe’s undisputed lingua franca (ELF), and much earlier research on ELF primarily revolved around identifying salient features for the purpose of a codification of ELF. Even though several salient features have been found in ELF, there is also increasing evidence of fluidity and flexibility, which brings the viability of a codification into question. Therefore, this thesis includes a case study, comprised of a corpus-based comparative analysis of English as a Lingua Franca in the professional organizational (PO) and leisure (LE) domains, in order to determine whether there is variability in salient ELF features. The results of the case study did not show any significant variability in the supposed salient ELF features in either domain. However, the features did not appear frequently enough in order to be considered as salient. Nevertheless, some evidence of variation was found in the features used by speakers of different lingual backgrounds, which could indicate that linguistic background plays a role in which particular forms are utilized at a particular point in a given ELF interaction. These findings, even though unexplored, support the observation that there are different ‘local Englishes’ in Europe, which makes the viability of attempting a description of ELF questionable. It can thus be concluded that a codification of Euro-English is unlikely at this point and that it makes more sense for English to continue as a lingua franca or to argue for a multiglossic recognition of Euro-Englishes.",
"Magic, Envy, Reparation: Egypt and the Decolonial Potential of Narrative","Mahmoud, Shaymaa","['Natermann, D.M.S.M']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Exploring postcolonial understandings of magic, narrative, healing and relationality in Egypt shows the Origin story as an untapped resource. Envy theory and colonial narcissism connect reparations, colonizers and contemporary Egyptians to the tale of Egyptian gods fighting for the kingdom of Egypt. From artifacts stolen and mummies consumed by colonizers to curses that led to the undoing of famous colonial archaeologists, a postcolonial look at colonial interactions within Egypt reveal many connections between the past, present and future of the country. Ancient Egyptian understandings and uses of magic and science filter through to today, including the interactions of these aspects with colonialism. The lens of postcolonialism will highlight the role that magic and narrative have in providing an indigenous dimension to colonial times, connections with nature and Egyptian experiences of agency over time. Looking at how Orientalist norms are maintained through a dominance of archaeology and Egyptology, and the resulting treatment of Egyptian antiquities will be supplemented with using overlapping disciplines to conduct more holistic research. Narrative, rememory and magic shape and contextualize both past and present efforts to preserve and present Egypt’s internationally valuable heritage. This complex web of interactions and their causes and effects are useful in healing reserves of colonial trauma as well as understanding the context for the country's future development in terms of reparations, museums as colonial curators and legacy safeguarding.","['Colonial', 'decolonial', 'Egypt', 'narrative', 'envy', 'global order', 'white supremacy']"

Fusies en samenwerkingen: Blijft nabijheid in de regionale journalistiek behouden?,"Lee, Simone van der","['Jong, J.C. de']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie is onderzoek gedaan naar het effect van de intensivering van de samenwerking met provinciale omroep NH Nieuws op de mate waarin nabijheid aanwezig is gebleven in de berichtgeving van regionale omroep Weeff. De Stichting Nederlandse Lokale Publieke Omroepen (NLPO) houdt zich momenteel bezig met het professionaliseren van lokale omroepen in Nederland om ervoor te zorgen dat lokale omroepen hun functie goed kunnen uitvoeren. Het komt daardoor steeds vaker voor dat lokale omroepen samengaan met andere lokale omroepen, of in dit specifieke geval de samenwerking opzoeken met een provinciale omroep. Hoewel kleinere omroepen op deze manier gebruik kunnen maken van de financiële mogelijkheden en de professionele kennis van een grotere omroep, vraagt men zich ook regelmatig af in hoeverre dit niet ten koste zou kunnen gaan van het lokale karakter van een dergelijke omroep. In deze scriptie wordt daarom de volgende hoofdvraag beantwoord: Op welke manieren is de rol van de nieuwswaarde ‘nabijheid’ in de online berichtgeving van streekomroep Weeff veranderd sinds de start van de intensieve samenwerking met provinciale omroep NH Nieuws? Dit is onderzocht aan de hand van een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse waarin een corpus van nieuwsberichten van regionale omroep Weeff voor de start van de intensivering van de samenwerking met NH Nieuws is vergeleken met een corpus van nieuwsberichten van de gemeenschappelijke nieuwsredactie van Weeff en NH Nieuws na de start van de intensivering van de samenwerking. Aan de hand van literatuur over dit onderwerp is een codeboek opgesteld aan de hand waarvan er in de nieuwsberichten naar bepaalde kenmerken van nabijheid gezocht kon worden. Zo is er onderscheid gemaakt tussen geografische, culturele, sociale en emotionele nabijheid. Naast de inhoudsanalyse zijn er twee interviews gehouden met betrokkenen bij Weeff en NH Nieuws. Op deze manier konden de resultaten uit de inhoudsanalyse verder in context worden geplaatst. Uit de inhoudsanalyse bleek dat er geen sprake was van een situatie waarbij er in zijn geheel sprake was van een sterke toe- of afname van nabijheid in één van de corpussen. Wel bleek dat bepaalde vormen van nabijheid sterker aanwezig waren in een bepaald corpus. Zo is er in het recente corpus meer aandacht besteed aan lokale geschiedenis en het uitlichten van lokale personen, bedrijven en verenigingen waarmee een bepaalde trots op de regio wordt aangeduid. Daarnaast worden er in dit corpus vaker mensen geciteerd, waarbij er meer aandacht aan hun gevoelens wordt besteed. In het oude corpus wordt meer aandacht besteed aan lokale sportverslaggeving en worden er vaker kleine lokale activiteiten onder de aandacht gebracht. Daarnaast is er een sterker wij-gevoel in dit corpus aanwezig en lijkt er vaker een bepaalde voorkennis van de lezer te worden verwacht in de berichtgeving. De interviews bevestigen ten dele dat deze verschillen voortkomen uit bewuste keuzes van de betrokken journalisten. Zo vindt de huidige nieuwsredactie diepgang en het menselijk maken van journalistiek belangrijk, terwijl er in de vroegere redactie juist veel waarde werd gehecht aan het kleine en lokale nieuws. Op basis van deze resultaten kan gesteld worden dat een intensieve samenwerking met een provinciale omroep niet zo’n sterk negatief effect op de mate van nabijheid in de berichtgeving hoeft te hebben als oorspronkelijk werd verwacht. De samenwerking lijkt er voornamelijk voor gezorgd te hebben dat nabijheid op een andere manier zichtbaar is geworden in de recente berichtgeving dan oorspronkelijk het geval was.","['nabijheid', 'lokale journalistiek', 'regionale journalistiek', 'streekomroep', 'NH Nieuws', 'Weeff', 'kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse']"

“The Bible is a flat-Earth book”: An Extended Pragma-Dialectical Analysis of Audience Adaptation in the Flat-Earth Conspiracy Theory,"Maruri-Ramos, Catalina",['R. Pilgram'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"One of the conspiracy theories that has increased in popularity during the last couple of years is about the Earth being flat. YouTube and the internet have played an important role in the wide spreading of the idea. Based on the apparent mistrust by flat Earthers of certain authorities, two types of fallacies seem predominant within the flat-Earth argumentative discourse: the argumentum ad hominem (argument against the person) and argumentum ad verecundiam (argument from authority). The aim of this thesis is to analyse the flat Earthers’ argumentative discourse through the lens of pragma-dialectics and observe which arguments tend to occur in light of the two authority-based fallacies. Audience adaptation is an equally important aspect to consider when analysing the strategic maneuvering of arguers in discussions. Unlike presentational design and topical potential, audience adaptation remains more open for expansion. It is also the aim of this thesis to expand on audience demand by including interdisciplinary behavioural studies. This is to understand the general attitudes and characteristics of flat Earthers and their audiences. In sum, the analysis is about how flat Earthers take into account their different audiences to maneuver strategically in the discussion by means of the authority-based fallacies. It could be observed that the fallacies of ad hominem, ad verecundiam (and its populistic variant ad populum) were advanced in strategically different ways. From appealing to God, the Bible, scientific referents, to even their own logical understanding of the world. Flat Earthers employed each of these strategies to both defend and attack standpoints while attempting to comply to their audiences. With these strategies, it could be identified that the main audiences flat Earthers wanted to adapt to were religious people. More specifically, Christian individuals with or without a conspiracy ideation who consider the government, NASA and anyone related to these as untrustworthy and dishonest. Other targeted audiences could include potential flat Earthers who may distrust established authorities and/or are Christian.","['Flat-Earth', 'pragma-dialectics', 'fallacies', 'ad hominem', 'ad verecundiam', 'audience adaptation', 'strategic maneuvering', 'expertise-based argumentation', 'critical questions']"

In short, the books pay too little attention to the topic, contain Eurocentric and one-sided narratives, biased language use and they rarely engage in current public debates around colonial history. A questionnaire was also conducted among high school students to discover how extensive their knowledge on Dutch colonialism is, and to get an insight on their opinions and perspectives regarding that history. The questionairre revealed that there are significant gaps in the students’ knowledge about Dutch colonialism. While the newer editions of the textbooks showed some improvements, the learning materials still have a long way to go.","['Colonial history', 'History education', 'The Netherlands', 'Indonesia', 'Colonialism', 'Dutch East Indies']"

"Yemeni Women activists and the Security Council: A Discourse Analysis from a Women, Peace and Security lens","Göth, Tamara","['David, M.E.L.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In 2020, the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda celebrated its 20th anniversary. But amidst a global pushback on women´s rights and the continuation of violence and conflict, the realization of the agenda seems a far dream. In Yemen, women played leading roles in the 2011 uprising and the National Dialogue Conference in 2013-2014. Yet, they have increasingly been excluded from Yemen’s political processes and peace efforts. This thesis centers the voices of five Yemeni women, who briefed the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Yemen between 2017 and 2020. Using a postcolonial feminist lens, this thesis investigates how the statements of these women activists and those of the United Kingdom and the United States of America in UN Security Council meetings on Yemen compare, and how these discourses in turn relate to the Women, Peace and Security agenda. In particular, by building on the analytical framework of Laura Shepherd (2008), the thesis analyzes the conceptualizations of gender, security, violence and the international sphere in the discourse. This dissertation argues that – despite their commitments to the WPS agenda – the UK and the US fail to take into account the gendered dimensions of the conflict in Yemen and to recognize the intersectional security threats women in Yemen face. As both states largely fail to engage with the opinions and recommendations of Women Civil Society Briefers from Yemen, they also fall short in reflecting on their own contributions to the continuing conflict in Yemen.","['Women, Peace and Security', 'Yemen', 'Discourse Analysis', 'Gender', 'Security Council']"
Strategic Planning for Sustainable Transport: An analysis of the mechanisms behind public policies for sustainable transport and infrastructure in Costa Rica,"Tang, Simon van der","['Solheim, H. A. S.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Costa Rica has set ambitious goals regarding climate issues. It strives to be carbon neutral in 2021, and aims to completely decarbonize their economy by 2050. The state of the transport and infrastructure in Costa Rica are therefore a thorn in the side for both civil society and policymakers. In light of the issues in this sector the government has formulated several policies with the goal to transform the transport sector, creating a clean, efficient and safe system of transport and infrastructure. Some of these policies will be discussed in this thesis, namely the Plan de Descarbonización 2018-2050, the Plan Integral de Movilidad Urbana Sostenible, and the Plan Nacional de Transporte 2011-2035. The focus of this thesis will be on the mechanisms behind these policies. As such, some key questions that will be addressed are: how is the policymaking process designed? Who are the actors in this process? What institutions are involved and how is coordination shaped? Where lie the biggest challenges in the implementation of these policies? As it currently is, the transport sector suffers from high degrees of fragmentation, with many institutions involved and no clear leadership. It is a very interesting subject for study, as these mechanisms are the foundations on which the implementation of the policy builds. Without proper understanding of the interactions and challenges that one is faced with in this sector, effective implementation of the policies, and therefore the reaching of the climate goals becomes less feasible. . The facilitation of the implementation of the plans through institutional transformation is argued to be the absolute priority for the achievement of the goals and objectives as proposed in the policies that will be discussed in this thesis. The expectation is that the Costa Rican public administration for the transport sector will require a comprehensive reform, and as it stands it lacks the capacity to push for such reform. In the first chapter of this thesis the conceptual and theoretical basis for the analysis of the transport sector will be laid. Here the concepts of the public policy process in Latin America, Neo-institutionalism, and Public-Private Partnerships will be discussed and put into perspective of how they can be used to analyse the Costa Rican transport and infrastructure sector. The second chapter will offer the contextualization of the topic of study. The chapter is organised chronologically and starts with the economic crisis of the 1980s in Costa Rica. The chapter then continues to address the state reform during the 1980s and 1990s, followed by the developments of the past twenty years. It concludes with a brief overview of the current situation and policies in the transport and infrastructure sector. The third and final chapter’s focus will be the analysis of the policies discussed using the concepts as discussed in the first chapter, looking into the mechanisms behind these policies and the actors involved in the process. The chapter starts with an analysis of the policy process, followed by an analysis of the role and functioning of the institutions involved. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the use of public-private partnerships and the challenges the public administration if faced with regarding coordination between the sectors.","['Public Policy', 'Latin America', 'Costa Rica', 'Transport sector', 'Infrastructure sector', 'Institutions', 'Institutionalism', 'Public-Private Partnerships', 'Sustainable transport', 'Sustainability', 'Policy process', 'Policy-making']"

An Indecent Partnership: IUCN and Shell: An Analysis of how a Leading International Environmental Organisation is Greenwashing one of the Biggest Polluters in the World,"Roever, Charlotte","['Black, L.O.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Partnerships of international environmental organisations (IEOs) and polluters can have positive outcomes for the environment, but they can also result in an organisation greenwashing a polluting company. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), a leading IEO, is partnering with the oil giant Royal Dutch Shell, one of the biggest polluters worldwide. This study aims to determine whether the partnership makes a positive contribution to the environment or if the opposite is the case and IUCN is greenwashing Shell. Specifically it investigates the effectiveness of an IUCN–Shell project in the Niger Delta, which aims to improve Shell’s sustainability record in the area. As a result of the project, two reports were published which give recommendations on how to reach this aim. These reports are the substance of this study’s methodology, with a number of hypotheses testing their integrity, whether they had a positive effect and whether the absence of positive effects was criticized by IUCN. Methods which test the hypotheses are a summative content analysis, evaluating the content – and process-tracing, assessing the effects of the reports. The results showed that IUCN is greenwashing Shell, as the reports are biased, not transparent and the authors not independent. Furthermore, there was determined only a minor process and a lack of criticism by IUCN to Shell’s poor behaviour. The outcome of the study questions not only the legitimacy of IUCN as an IEO but also the overall system of global environmental governance in which these organisations operate and are entrusted with effecting a meaningful impact for the environment.","['IUCN', 'Shell', 'Greenwashing', 'International Environmental Organisation', 'Niger Delta', 'Oil Pollution']"

Some scholars argue that China uses its economic diplomacy in a coercive way, while other scholars argue against this notion. This thesis discusses China's economic diplomacy with its research question: ""What drives China’s economic diplomacy in the case of political disputes in East-Asia?"". The thesis examines two disputes between China and its neighbouring countries, Japan and South Korea, in order to research how China employs its economic power. The research is based on three factors that influence how China creates its economic diplomacy; national sentiment, history of the bilateral relations, and bilateral trade. Using process-tracing, the thesis examines these three factors of the THAAD dispute with South Korea and the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands dispute with Japan. The aim of the thesis is to demonstrate that, while national sentiment, previous bilateral relations, and bilateral trade influence China's economic diplomacy, these factors do not influence China’s decision-making equally. The thesis concludes that national sentiment influences the Chinese government the most to use its economic diplomacy coercively.","['China', 'East-Asia', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Economic Diplomacy']"

Popularisation of the Feminist Movement: How Do Mainstream Instagram Trends Such As The VSCO Girls Incorporate Feminist Ideals In Their Aesthetic?,"Janssen, Anna","['Fedorova, K.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis will focus on the popularisation of the feminist movement. It will look into how several influential mainstream Instagram trends, such as the VSCO Girls and the Insta-Baddies, incorporate feminist ideals in their aesthetic. Nowadays, stereotypical gender imagery is not only visible in advertisements, films and pop culture anymore, but also on social media. Platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, where imagery is the main component, have a humongous influence on its users’ way of thinking, and with that their self-image and self-esteem. Through the past decade, there has been risen more attention for these so-called toxic social media habits. New online social media trends try to reprogram the well-known stereotypes and toxic aspects. The focus of this thesis is, therefore, on the influence feminism has on visual media, specifically female performativity in Instagram posts. Do women challenge or perform the Male Gaze? Could there be said that current Instagram aesthetics execute feminist ideals? The trends will be analysed (loosely) based on the Roman stylistics of translatio, imitatio and aemulatio. This will show where we are currently finding ourselves in the progress of challenging the Male Gaze and executing feminist ideals online. It will show that there has been made quite some progress, especially in mainstream culture, but that there is still a long way to go as well.","['feminism', 'performativity', 'female performativity', 'social media', 'gen z']"

De persistentie van misinformatie: debiasing van misinformatie bij factchecken,"Hesselink, Isabella","['Pleijter, A.R.J.', 'Burger, J.P.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Sinds het begin van de coronaviruspandemie verspreidt mis- en desinformatie zich ongelimiteerd en razendsnel op traditionele en sociale media. Factchecken wordt beschouwd als het middel om mis- en desinformatie te bestrijden. Desondanks blijkt uit bestaande literatuur dat factchecken slechts in beperkte mate effectief is in het aanpassen van misvattingen, omdat mensen geneigd zijn om informatie die niet overkomt met bestaande overtuigingen te negeren. Factcheckers hechten steeds meer waarde aan transparantie. Er is echter weinig empirisch bewijs voor het effect van transparantie bij factchecken. Derhalve wordt in dit huidige onderzoek onderzocht wat de invloed is van transparantie in factcheckartikelen op 1) de gepercipieerde betrouwbaarheid en 2) op de accuraatheid en zekerheid van overtuigingen over misvattingen. In totaal namen 112 participanten (m.b.t. onderzoeksvraag over betrouwbaarheid) en 79 participanten (m.b.t. onderzoeksvraag over accuraatheid en zekerheid) mee aan het onderzoek. Na onderzocht te hebben of participanten een misvatting hadden over het coronavirus, kregen zij ofwel een transparant ofwel een niet-transparant factcheckartikel te lezen. De resultaten toonden aan dat transparantie geen invloed had op de gepercipieerde betrouwbaarheid en op de accuraatheid van overtuigingen. Echter, het lezen van een factcheckartikel leidde globaal wel tot accuratere overtuigingen. Daarnaast toonde dit onderzoek aan dat het consumeren van een niet-transparant factcheckartikel tot onzekerdere overtuigingen leidde. Het lezen van een transparant factcheckartikel had geen invloed op de zekerheid van overtuigingen. Aangezien dit fundamenteel onderzoek betreft, wordt aangeraden om deze huidige studie te repliceren voor robuustere bevindingen.","['(misinformatie', 'fact-checking', 'misvattingen', 'debiasing', 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'transparantie', 'motivated reasoning theory)']"

A paradigm shift to neurodiversity model in the representations of autism spectrum disorder: in what ways do autistic Japanese YouTubers challenge the medical view of autism?,"Vänskä, Janita","['Nakamura, M.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The medical model defines autism as disorder and disability which includes deficits in social communication, repetitive behaviour, abnormalities in sensory processing and cognition. The definition implies a need for a cure and alleviating autistic traits. However, the medical model has been challenged by the neurodiversity model, which understands autism as a neurological difference rather than a disorder. The neurodiversity movement started in English speaking autistic online communities and aims to embrace the differences, reduce stigma and create autistic culture. This thesis aims to find out if, and in what ways, do Japanese autistic Youtubers challenge the medical model. There is a lack of studies on Japanese autistic communities, neurodiversity movement and first-person views. Ten YouTube videos made on autism by Japanese autistic or other neurodivergent people were selected for qualitative narrative analysis. While most YouTubers presented a conception similar to the medical model, they also subtly challenged it by presenting themselves as an authority on autism, showing the positive sides of autism, critiquing universal applicability of stereotypes, using labels for autism created in autistic communities and suggesting changes in the socio-cultural environment as a way to mitigate challenges. While there were no direct references to the neurodiversity movement, there has been an increase in online content made by autistic people, which enables changes in discourse in future.","['medical humanities', 'disability studies', 'autism', 'neurodiversity', 'online communities']"

Notably, the tandem Celaya-Awful Grandmother forges a bond to deeply revisit societal sexism, showing that inside benevolent sexist ideals there is a subjacent willingness for a redefinition of womanhood and sexuality outside sexism. As a ghost, her Awful Grandmother Soledad embodies for Celaya the needed support to act upon and become her desired self: an independent, educated young woman. By choosing not to reproduce the hegemonic discourse around fairy-tale-like love stories, Celaya explicitly refers to telenovela narratives and her opportunity to choose which narrative –comedy or tragedy– she wants to be the protagonist of. This final reflection poses a firm suggestion on how telenovela narratives can mirror these redefinitions on womanhood and sexuality that populate Chicana feminist writings","['Telenovela', 'Chicana literature', 'Latina literature', 'Chicana studies', 'Gender studies', 'Popular culture']"

Holodomor: The Ukrainian Famine of 1932-1933 as an Instrument of Consolidatory Mass Violence,"Dijk, Marinus Johan van","['Maat, E. van der']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Ukrainian famine or ‘Holodomor’ of 1932–1933 claimed the lives of an estimated 4 to 4.5 million people. General consensus has it that the famines that swept the Soviet Union were caused largely by the collectivisation drive of the First Five-Year Plan, after which the situation in Ukraine was exacerbated by Stalin’s policies in the winter of 1932–1933. However, the underlying motives for Stalin’s actions with regard to Ukraine remain a matter of lively debate. Combining the existing literature on the initiation of mass indiscriminate violence in general and on the causes of the Holodomor in particular with novel insights from studies on authoritarian politics, I posit that the Ukrainian famine may have been intentionally aggravated because the Ukrainian leadership was considered a liability to Stalin’s rule. Rather than facing these elites head on, I suggest that Stalin weaponised the famine as a means of mass indiscriminate violence to enable the capture of local institutions and to undermine the individual support bases of his potential rivals. In this way the Ukrainian Communist Party was purged from the bottom to the top, culminating with the executions of Stanislav Kosior and Vlas Chubar and the expulsion of Grigory Petrovsky, as well as the executions of Pavel Postyshev and Vsevolod Balytsky during the Great Purges of 1937–1939.","['Holodomor', 'Ukraine', 'famine', 'genocide', 'consolidation', 'mass violence', 'Stalin']"
China and Myanmar: The success and failure of the Belt and Road Initiative,"Korenstra, Erik","['Black, L.

Here the BRI will be approached as a ‘spatial fix’, meaning that economic activities are geographically relocated as a solution to China’s domestic economic challenges. Two Chinese megaprojects in Myanmar will be investigated, namely the Myitsone Hydropower Dam and the China-Myanmar Oil and Gas Pipelines. Although both projects have a significant impact on the local environment and were met with severe opposition, the Myitsone Dam was suspended, whereas the China-Myanmar pipelines were continued. To explain this variation, the following research question will be answered: ‘Under what conditions are BRI infrastructure projects successful?’. In terms of methodology, a combination of ‘preference attainment’, ‘attributed influence’, and ‘process-tracing’ will be applied. From this analysis, the conclusion of this thesis is derived, which states that the following three conditions are key in the success or failure of the projects: (1) the existence of alternative investment sources, (2) the extent of a civil society movement against the project and (3) the position of both China and the host country on the project.","['Myanmar', 'China', 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'spatial fix']"
"‘GA NAAR TWITTER, GEBRUIK JE GEZONDE VERSTAND EN ZOEK MET GOOGLE’: Het gebruik en de verificatie van User Generated Content die afkomstig is van Sociale Media door journalisten van Nederlandse landelijke internetmedia","Jak, Thomas","['Burger, J.P.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De opkomst van internet, en sociale media in het bijzonder, heeft ervoor gezorgd dat de scheiding tussen nieuwsbron, -producent en -consument minder scherp is afgebakend dan in de tijd voor het internet. Sociale media vormen kanalen waarmee niet alleen journalisten van traditionele media, maar ook niet-journalisten via sociale media een groot publiek kunnen bereiken. Daardoor is de rol van de journalist veranderd. Journalisten hebben geen monopolie meer op gatekeeping van informatie. Zij onderscheiden zich nu niet meer van niet-journalisten door poortwachters te zijn, maar door een zo waarheidsgetrouw, objectief en volledig mogelijk nieuwsverhaal te produceren. Om dat te kunnen doen, moeten zij de informatie waaruit het nieuwsverhaal bestaat zo goed mogelijk verifiëren. Dat proces is niet vastomlijnd, maar heeft als doel het verspreiden van onjuiste informatie te voorkomen. Daarnaast zijn sociale media een extra bron van potentieel nieuwswaardige informatie voor journalisten. User Generated Content (UGC), beeld- en geluidsopnames afkomstig van niet-journalisten op Sociale Media, helpen bij snelle verslaggeving, zowel in het verificatieproces als bij de productie van artikelen. Dit onderzoek bouwt voort op het onderzoek van Brandtzaeg et al. (2016). Zij onderzochten het gebruik van sociale media in verslaggeving door journalisten van verschillende West-Europese media. Journalisten in dat onderzoek hanteren verschillende criteria bij de selectie van informatie en verschillende methoden om die informatie te verifiëren. Dit onderzoek richt zich op de rol van Nederlandse journalisten die nieuws publiceren via een professionele mediaorganisatie. De onderzoeksvraag van dit paper luidt: Hoe selecteren, verifiëren, gebruiken en verantwoorden journalisten van landelijke nieuwsmedia in Nederland User Generated Content? Voor het selecteren van sociale media is Twitter, door de toegankelijkheid en handzaamheid, bijna zonder uitzondering het standaard medium waar journalisten UGC zoeken voor in hun nieuwsartikelen. Dat is in overeenstemming met Brandtzaeg et al. (2016). Daarnaast is Google zo alomtegenwoordig in het verificatieproces van Nederlandse journalisten. Andere sociale media worden ook gebruikt, maar pas als tweede keus en/of als de journalist een specifieke reden ziet een bepaald medium te gebruiken. Daarnaast kwamen de gevarieerde kunde, en kennis van verificatiestrategieën en tools van de verschillende journalisten overeen met de bevindingen van Brandtzaeg et al. (2016). Ondanks de consensus onder alle geïnterviewde journalisten van verschillende media dat alleen geverifieerde UGC gepubliceerd kan worden, lijkt de tendens: hoe belangrijker een mediaorganisatie beeld acht, hoe sneller een journalist UGC publiceert.","['Journalism', 'Verification', 'User Generated Content', 'UGC', 'Social Media']"

This results in the popularization of a practice that is removed from its original shapes found in Buddhism. Besides the popularization of mindfulness, the formation of Buddhist modernism has developed in the same places. This thesis aims to determine how these developments occurred and answer the question how the global popularization of mindfulness corresponds to the emergence of Buddhist modernism in the late 20th century. Using a historical approach, the influence of secularization and scientific rationalization on Buddhism and mindfulness have been analyzed. Reaching the conclusion that the popularization of mindfulness and emergence of Buddhist modernism are simultaneous developments influencing each other as a result of secularization and further detraditionalization and demystification of eastern traditions by western cultures. This research has been conducted by the help of a qualitative analysis of academic and popular literature from archives and public journals to enhance the knowledge and insight of contemporary mindfulness’ origins and the nature of Buddhist modernism today.","['Mindfulness', 'Buddhist modernism', 'Secularization', 'Scientific Rationalization', 'Detraditionalization', 'Demystification']"

Japan’s Response to China’s Belt and Road Initiative: The Role of the Private Sector diplomacy and Governance Values in Sino-Japanese Rivalry,"Chang, Yi-Yu","['Chang, V.K.L.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The financial crisis of 2007-2008 had a great negative impact on the world. It also revealed how much the global economy is dependent on financial centres in the West. In the wake of the crisis in 2010, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) assessed that the Asian region had a huge infrastructure gap of trillions in US dollars which needed to be filled. According to a report of the ADB, increasing infrastructure in Asia and fixing this gap would decrease the Asian region’s reliance on the Western economy and reduce the risk of a worldwide financial crisis reoccurring. China and Japan have hugely increased their efforts to address the need for infrastructure in the last decade, in both a competitive and cooperative manner. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) are two initiatives which were announced in 2013 by the same Chinese leadership and are focused on the building of infrastructure. Japan has responded to these initiatives in a very ambiguous manner. On the one hand, Japan launched the Partnership for Quality Infrastructure (PQI) in 2015, just before the AIIB was officially signed, as an infrastructure-funding initiative which has competed with the BRI. On the other hand, Japan still started “conditional engagement” with China on 52 BRI projects despite Japan’s initial doubts about the ability for proper governance and lending practices. This thesis will examine both the cooperative response and the competitive response of Japan towards the BRI and AIIB. To analyse the cooperative element, it will use Brooks’ modern liberalist theory, which argues that Multinational Corporations (MNCs) and International Production Networks (IPNs) have become the more influential part of economic interdependence, and has mostly replaced the factor of interstate trade. From Brooks’ modernized liberalist perspective, this thesis argues that the Keidanren, one of Japan’s business federations has played a significant role in the road to cooperation between China and Japan on BRI projects. To analyse the competitive element, this thesis will use Nabers’ discursive approach and apply it to competition between China’s BRI/AIIB, and Japan’s Asian Development Bank (ADB) and PQI. It will focus on the standards and values portrayed by both countries’ initiatives, and it argues that they are converging, which is producing a fertile ground for increasing and deepening cooperation between China and Japan on infrastructure projects in third countries.","['Belt and Road Initiative', 'Partnership for Quality Infrastucuture', 'Private Sector Diplomacy', 'Keidanren', 'Sino-Japanese relations']"

In Hill House (1902-4) is deze toepassing op zijn hoogtepunt. Met zijn innovatieve ontwerpen ontwikkelde Mackintosh ontwikkelde zich tot het gezicht van de Glasgowse stijl. Zijn vroege interieurs zijn beïnvloed door een aantal voorgangers, waaronder de witte interieurs in de schilderkunst van de negentiende eeuw en de invloedrijke interieurontwerpen van Godwin die voortkwamen uit de invloed van Japanse esthetiek. Ook heeft Mackintosh op meer directe wijze invloed uit Japanse kunst en cultuur ondergaan binnen zijn netwerk, onder andere door zijn contact met Hermann Muthesius. Zijn samenwerking met leden van de Wiener Secession heeft een impuls gegeven aan de Weense kunstenaars. Het contact met Joseph Hoffmann zorgde voor een stimulans in Mackintosh’ ontwikkeling, wat uiteindelijk heeft geresulteerd in de geometrische decoraties van Hill House.","['Mackintosh', 'geometrische decoratie', 'Japan', 'witte interieurs', 'Josef Hoffmann']"

The role of non-governmental organizations in the integration and non-discrimination of refugees in the Brazilian labor market,"Silva Paiva, Camila",['Dr. Valdivia Rivera'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since 2010, Brazil has been receiving an increase in the numbers of refugees. It is presumed that the protagonist in assisting the integration of refugees are the NGOs and not the state. NGOs are known for providing aid, social services and advocacy for groups and minorities that are marginalized. Currently, there are approximately 100 NGOs supporting and representing refugees in Brazil; it is the largest refugee support network in Latin America. This study seeks to answer the question with respect to which measures have NGOs adopted to assist the integration and non-discrimination of refugees in the Brazilian labor market and whether such measures reach beyond NGOs role as a support structure by replacing the role of the state and its responsibility to provide refugees of their (human) rights. To answer this research question, eight NGOs and three professionals in the area were interviewed during a field research that took place between July and November 2020. The research shows that the NGOs have taken two categories of measures as a means to address both the refugees, and the host society and private sector with the purpose of enhancing the effect and reachability of their role in the integration and non-discrimination of refugees in the Brazilian labor market. This research found that the NGOs and the public intuitions have a vast network in respect of refugees; however, it can also vary between states. It further found that there are two different opinions among the NGOs regarding their relationship with the state.",['Refugees Brazil Integration Labor Market Discrimination']
TRAIANO OPTIMO PRINCIPI: Een onderzoek naar de dativus in de keizernaam op munten van Trajanus en Hadrianus,"Snoeij, Wieke","['Claes, L.M.G.F.E.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Gedurende een groot deel van de regering van Trajanus en het begin van de regering van Hadrianus verschijnt de keizernaam op de keizerlijke muntslag niet in de nominativus, wat voor die tijd gebruikelijk was, maar in de dativus. Dit suggereert dat de munt niet door de keizer, maar voor de keizer werd geslagen. Dit leidt tot de vraag wie of wat de autoriteit achter deze munten was. In mijn scriptie heb ik deze vraag beantwoord door deze dativusmuntslag in kaart te brengen, waardoor aan het licht kwam dat de letters S P Q R (Senatus Populusque Romanus), de senaat en het volk van Rome, bijna exclusief op de dativusmuntslag van Trajanus aanwezig waren. Dit leidde tot de conclusie dat met de dativusmuntslag werd beoogd de boodschap te verspreiden dat Trajanus een goede keizer was die rekening hield met het volk en de senaat. Vervolgens heb ik gekeken wie of wat de autoriteit achter deze munten kon zijn, waarbij ik de conclusie heb getrokken dat het een soort evenwicht is, met soms de keizer die meer invloed had en soms de senaat of de muntmagistraten. Dit was afhankelijk van de aan/-afwezigheid van de keizer en de positie van individuele magistraten. De dativusmuntslag van Hadrianus heeft een andere oorzaak, omdat die in het begin de muntslag van Trajanus imiteerde, waarbij zowel zijn keizertitels als de dativus werd overgenomen. Hier is de autoriteitsvraag moeilijker te beantwoorden, maar de afwezigheid van Hadrianus ten tijde van deze muntslag suggereert een autoriteit van senaat en van muntmagistraten.","['Trajanus', 'Hadrianus', 'keizerlijke muntslag', 'dativus', 'senaat: muntmagistraten']"

Chinese policies, regulations and guidelines concerning both are considered. Both quantitative data and qualitative data is included in the discussion. Green economics and green development are the lens through which the findings have been observed and interpreted. The ultimate result of the research is that, even though the power mix of Chinese OFDI in energy in 2018 had a higher percentage of renewable energy than China’s domestic power mix (37% versus 12%), the policies regulating China’s power sector are tailored to make it green, namely by reducing the consumption and production of fossil energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and increasing the share of renewable energy in China’s total energy mix. On the other hand, guidelines concerning the environmental dimension of Chinese OFDI do not make any concrete and enforceable efforts to green investments. Only the policies aimed at encouraging OFDI in renewable energy seem to have the effect of greening Chinese OFDI in energy.","[""People's Republic of China"", 'outward foreign direct investment', 'energy', 'green energy', 'green economics.']"

Lucassen'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to investigate the construction and the conceptualisation of the Dutch citizenship boundaries in the period 1880-1914. These boundaries are analysed by focusing on nationality, naturalisation, and expulsion policy, that determined the criteria for membership and entry. As a result of the rise of nation-states, citizenship was transformed into a crucial marker of identification, not only determining criteria of membership and entry, but also that of residence and work. This transformation began at the end of the nineteenth century. The primary sources consist of parliamentary debates, and correspondence between parliament and government, which illuminate the development of policy and the conceptualisation of citizenship. These sources were selected through query analysis. Furthermore, a selection of expulsion orders was collected to investigate the relatively unknown practice of expulsion policy. Both the criteria of membership and entry became more strict and demarcated. Immigrants and their offspring became largely excluded from citizenship through a new nationality law, and an increasing amount of ‘unwanted’ and lower-class aliens was controlled and expelled. A relational approach illuminated that state and society constructed the citizenship boundaries in interaction, and that the citizenship boundaries were constructed in relation to that of other countries, most notably Germany. The development of the citizenship boundaries at the end of the nineteenth century is analysed in detail, which had important influences on issues of membership and entry in later periods.","['Citizenship', 'Dutch national identity', 'Naturalisation', 'Expulsion']"

The Evolution of the Divinatory Professions in First Millennium BCE Mesopotamia,"Jacob, Alison M.",['Natalie May'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This paper explores the evolution of the profession ṭupšar Enūma Anu Enlil and the connection to the decline in the presence of the profession of the ‘haruspex’ or bārû. The focus of the discussion lies during the late Neo-Assyrian period to the Arsacid period and the end of cuneiform documentation (674 BCE -75 AD). The extant cuneiform record of the bārû and ṭupšar Enūma Anu Enlil were used to exemplify scribal development and the melding of divinatory traditions. Social network analysis was employed to show how Neo-Assyrian divinatory scholars in the court of Nineveh interacted with each other. Furthermore, social network establishes how they interacted at court and what they advised on and to whom. Secondly, the evidence of Neo-Babylonian and Late-Babylonian scholars using the titles of bārû and ṭupšar Enūma Anu Enlil and their text corpus were compared. This was assessed to determine the change and shift of the evolution of the divinatory disciplines. It was determined that the different facets of divination were combined by scholars during the first millennium and celestial divination, replacing extispicy as the preferred method of divination. The aim was to show how transmission analysis can facilitate the perception of the decline and emergence of scholarly titles. The intent was to uncover community interaction and the criteria for the evolution of the divinatory profession. By the end of cuneiform documentation many of the practices of the bārû were combined into the practice of the ṭupšar Enūma Anu Enlil, however this varied between different cities in both the title and the mode of scholarly interpretation.","['Divinatory professions', 'ṭupšar Enūma Anu Enlil', 'bārû']"

The situations of limbo have been analyzed by drawing from theories of mobility and liminality. First, the situations in the refugee camps and the AZCs have been analyzed through a spatial and a temporal dimension of liminality. Secondly, the situations of limbo have been analyzed as connected to theories of mobility, and especially immobility by investigating what influences migratory routes. In the refugee camps of Northern Ethiopia and The Sudan, Eritrean refugees find themselves pushed to the edges of society, unable to participate. Similarly, the Eritrean refugees that are resettled to the Netherlands, find themselves in the same kind of in-betweenness in the Dutch asylum seekers centres (AZCs), waiting for approval while being prevented from participating in Dutch society. Furthermore, in this paper it has been argued that the Eritrean refugees are kept in limbo, in remote locations from as a result of the policies that an international mobility regime, in the form of the European Union that interacts with the African states with the goal of hindering border-crossing mobility. Within nations too, the mobility of the refugees in limbo are extremely restricted, being confined to the camps and the AZCs.","['Liminality', 'Mobility', 'Mobility regimes', 'Eritrean refugees']"
The Relation Between the Housing Insecurity in South Korea and the Process of Young Adults Moving Out of Their Parental Home,"Stip, Elise Antje","['Jang, S.Y.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"South Korea is currently experiencing a significant housing problem with skyrocketing housing prices. This study aims to find out how the housing insecurity felt by many South Korean citizens affects young adults in particular in their process of moving out of their parental home. In this context housing insecurity is defined as the uncertainty people feel when looking for housing due to the high housing prices and low availability. To test the hypothesis that the housing insecurity is causing young adults to delay their move out of their parents house an online questionnaire has been distributed to a number of South Korean young adults. The results show that the housing price has in fact influenced the participants to stay with their parents longer. However, the research has also proven that South Korean young adults do not feel the need to move out as intensely as initially thought. This shows that while the housing insecurity does have an effect on the moving out process it cannot be pointed at as the sole cause. Improvements in the housing quality, price and location need to be made to prevent more young adults from delaying their move to independent living.","['housing insecurity', 'social housing', 'South Korea', 'young adults']"

Orange Man Mad: U.S.-North Korean Relations in the Trump Era,"Gabeler, Sjoerd","['Gawthorpe, A.J.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines U.S.-North Korean relations during the Trump administration, particularly focusing on how President Trump's behavior can be explained in light of the ""Madman Theory"". By applying Roseanne W. McManus' typology, it is argued that Trump's madness is characterized by situational deviation from consequence-based decision-making, which is hypothesized to be potentially helpful. Furthermore, this thesis examines the effectiveness of Trump's usage of madness during the first year of his presidency compared to his later summit diplomacy. This thesis argues that while the usage of perceived madness was helpful in bringing North Korea to the negotiating table, it was no more successful than summit diplomacy in bringing about denuclearization of the peninsula, while summit diplomacy at least brought stability to the region. Denuclearizing North Korea seems to be possible only through regime change, a costly venture both in terms of human lives and economic costs. For this reason, summit diplomacy seems to be the preferable option.","['Trump', 'North Korea', 'Madman Theory', 'United States', 'Kim Jong Un']"

Likewise, this research sought to determine what significance her use of the Ukrainian language in her early prose fiction had apart from its folkloric / national values, and whether it had any significance for the topic of gender. She was the first female Ukrainian writer. Using the Ukrainian language uttered by peasant and serf women, Vovchok found a way to talk about otherwise difficult issues through a kind of ‘wilderness’, defined by Elaine Showalter as being outside of male experience. Female bodily, cultural, and social issues were problematic in the contemporary literature of the Russian Empire. Therefore, her deployment of a neutral form of Ukrainian, but based on female peasant and serf forms of speech with folk elements, opened up a ‘wilderness’ of expression not yet available to anyone in Ukrainian – whether they were male or female authors. Another important feature of her stories and their language is their universalism: firstly, in their applicability to oppressed people everywhere, and secondly in their applicability to oppressed women everywhere.","['Ukrainian Literature', 'first voice narrator', 'women', 'serfdom', 'peasantry', 'vernacular', 'prose', 'female wilderness', 'Marko Vovchok']"

It evaluates the incentive behind the message of diversity and equality that is claimed to be conveyed by the archive, methodized by food genealogy and presents a menu of recipes that are subject to deconstruction. The shifting representations of the selected food practices with indigenous origins that have been subject to globalization are traced within four major historical periods and their associated dynamics: the precolonial period (original formation), the colonial era (reformation), the Republic (nationalisation), and eventually contemporary time (gentrification). Additionally, it illustrates the flaws of substantiation of the written mission of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs by placing the archive into dialogue with the hinterland of the recipes’ foodways, illustrating the dangerously fine line between gastronomic multiculturalism and culinary colonialism.","['traditional Colombian cuisine', 'national identity', 'decolonialism', 'gastronomic multiculturalism']"
Religious extremism in Western Europe: The pivotal role of disproportionate secularism,"Berg, Julia van den","['Maat, E. van der']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Rising numbers of religious extremism are an increasing concern in Western Europe. As Western Europe is secular, and secular ideology seeks to diminish the influence of religion on society, this rise is peculiar. It raises the question why religious extremism is on the rise in Western Europe despite its secular environment. Evidence suggests there is a causal link between religious extremism and secularism. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate such a causal relation between secularism and religious extremism in Western Europe. To rule out other explanations, this study identified two rival explanations: A cultural disconnect and geopolitical factors. The validity of all three explanations was tested through a case study analysis of France, the Netherlands and Belgium. The results concluded that the cultural disconnect and the geopolitical explanation are not correct. However, the study concluded that certain forms of secularism lead to a rise of religious extremism in Western Europe. The cases demonstrate the mechanism behind this: States enforce disproportionately strict secular policies through a strict separation between the public sphere and the private sphere, and a positive bias towards the pre-existing dominant religion. These two factors trigger reactive religiosity, leading to religious extremism. Conclusively, disproportionate secularism plays a pivotal role in the rise of religious extremism in Western Europe.","['Secularism', 'extremism', 'religion', 'Western Europe', 'Christianity', 'Islam']"

A Conservative Investment Approach as Remedy for Financial Crises: Using Value Investing to Investigate the Dot-com Crisis and the Great Recession,"Tacken, Daniël","['Shidiq, A.R.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Research has shown that major causes of financial crises, like leverage and the overvaluation of financial assets, are due to the recurring problem of excessive financial risk-taking in financial markets. This thesis examines whether using a more conservative investment approach could make financial crises less likely - and to do so, I focus on value investing as the example of a conservative investment approach. Value investing is a small, but persistent niche in the financial markets, whose core ideas are inversely correlated to some of the main causes for financial crises. It cautions against large amounts of debt, argues for conservatively valuing financial assets, and warns that humans are fallible beings that don’t always behave rational in financial markets. Using the dot- com crisis and the Great Recession of 2007-2009 in the United States as study cases, I find that there is compelling evidence that a conservative investment approach can potentially make financial crises less likely by reducing exposure on over-leveraged assets, avoiding overvalued assets and counter the misleading assumption of human infallibility in the financial markets.","['Financial Crisis', 'Value Investing']"

al-Hashd al-Shaʿbi: Contesting Hybrid Statehood in Iraq,"Wijk, Koen van","['Calculli, M.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Al-Hashd al-Shaʿbi or the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) is an umbrella of armed groups in Iraq that united in 2014 in cooperation with the government in order to defeat IS. Officially, the organization is under the control of the Prime-Minister (PM). In reality, however, it has retained operational and administrative independence, often directly ignoring orders from the PM and even attacking foreign forces in Iraq and the region. This thesis addresses the question of how the PMF has been able to retain much of its independence throughout the six years of its existence, in which the government has often attempted to rein it in. It also considers the implications of the PMF’s independence for the notion of the sovereignty of the Iraqi government. It finds that the PMF is not a singular organization, but rather a collective of independent groups that vie with each other for funding, influence, and power. The key grouping within the PMF is that of the Iranian-backed Hashd. Many other PMF groups rely on this alliance because of its control of the PMF’s central administration, which distributes funding. Iran and its allies in Iraq benefit from the PMF’s independence from potentially anti-Iranian PMs, and the cover and plausible deniability that the lack of oversight grants them. This is abetted by the support the PMF enjoys in the Iraqi parliament through its own presence there, and through political opportunists or pro-Iranian ideologues. The PMF uses its military, social, and political power to actively undermine the government in different ways. Iraq’s security sector can only properly be understood as an ‘armed political order’ in which different actors and groupings continuously vie for influence in violent and non-violent ways. The office of the PM is one venue for contestation, and the person of the PM only one of its actors. Coercive organizations of all sorts participate in this contestation. An anti-governmental Hashd group is not inherently different in this regard than a unit of the Iraqi Army. Its position is different because of the different structural constraints on both groups, and their alignment towards the government. The competition between the different Hashd groups and the recent protests which led to the appointment of PM al-Kadhimi indicate that no one – including the pro-Iranian camp – is truly dominant in the Iraqi armed order.","['Iraq', 'Armed Groups', 'Hybrid Sovereignty', 'Al-Hashd Al-Shaʿbi', 'Iran', 'Conflict Studies']"

In dit onderzoek is onderzocht of vacaturetaal een bijdrage levert aan deze scheve verdeling. Uit een korte corpusstudie en een uitgebreide enquête blijkt dat vacaturetaal genderstereotypen in de hand werkt: agentic termen, woorden die stereotiep aan mannen worden gekoppeld, zijn vooral te vinden in vacatureteksten voor functies waar mannen de overhand hebben. Bij stereotiepe vrouwenberoepen vinden we vooral communal termen terug. Echter, vacaturetaal blijkt ook een mogelijke oplossing te bieden voor de scheve verdeling in het werkveld: door paarvormen (agent/agente) in plaats van de generieke mannelijke vorm (agent) of de m/v-vorm (agent (m/v)) te gebruiken in de functietitel, worden vrouwen meer aanwezig in de mentale representatie. De rest van de vacaturetekst moet zowel agentic als communal en weinig genderneutrale termen bevatten om aantrekkelijk te zijn voor beide genders. Kortom, diversiteit in vacaturetaal zorgt voor diversiteit op de werkvloer.","['Vacatures', 'gender-gekleurd taalgebruik', 'genderstereotypen', 'baanadvertenties', 'communal', 'agentic']"

Creating LGBTQ+ Representation: The Value of Fanfiction and Young Adult Literature,"Geertsma, Esmée","['Kasten, M.J.A.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyzes the social and academic value of fanfiction concerned with LGBTQ+ representation in Young Adult Literature. Since the heteronormative discourse looks upon LGBTQ+ as a controversial theme, LGBTQ+ identities and storylines in media such as literature are often stereotyped and negative. Young Adult Literature finds itself in a position where it can provide positive LGBTQ+ representation because of its tendency towards realism. However, existing power structures still prevent this genre from fully reaching its potential. This potential can be realized through fanfiction, an open discourse available on the internet. On fanfiction platforms, people with LGBTQ+ identities write the narratives they need based on official media stories, such as literature and movies. This thesis offers two comparative analyses. First, I will compare the non-LGBTQ+ Young Adult novels The Hunger games: Catching Fire and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, with a selection of corresponding LGBTQ+ fanfiction. In the second part, I present a comparison between the LGBTQ+ Young Adult novel Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe and a selection of corresponding LGBTQ+ fanfiction. Both of these analyses research the interpretations by fanfiction writers of the Young Adult novels on which they are grafted, highlighting their specific needs with regard to LGBTQ+ representation.","['Young Adult Literature', 'YAL', 'fanfiction', 'LGBTQ', 'LGBTQ+', 'Reader Response Theory', 'YRRL', 'Youthful Reader Response Literature', 'Representation', 'Media', 'Literature']"
Russia in the Global Arctic: between cooperation and confrontation,"Herbert, Tjadina","['Frear, M.J.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Arctic region finds itself increasingly in the international spotlight, especially since globalisation and melting ice coverage offer many new economic opportunities. Russia, in particular, has received much attention and is occasionally described as the region’s “wild card”, based on international wariness about an increasingly assertive Russian leadership. In the last decade, Moscow has significantly expanded its military capabilities in the region and has adopted a more securitised stance on economic development of its Arctic territories, yet at the same time, it has consistently been an active presence in Arctic regional cooperation. This thesis explores the seeming bipolarity in Russia’s behaviour by paying special attention to the link between ideational and material motivations. Premised on the idea that the formation of national interests of a state is closely connected with the formation of its national identity, it identifies Russia’s pursuit of great power status in the Arctic as a key driver of Russian Arctic policy. Borrowing from critical geopolitics, which suggests that territory and geography are subject of active formulation and reformulation by governments, this thesis analyses policy documents to illustrate how the Kremlin conceptualises three different understandings of the Arctic region (the Arctic as a zone of peace and cooperation; the Arctic as essential for ensuring national security; and the Arctic as a base for Russia’s economic revival) as guided by different interests.","['Russia', 'Arctic', 'Russian Arctic policy', 'critical geopolitics']"

Killer Language: The Truthfulness of Language Tendencies of Fictional Psychopathic Killers,"Persoon, Laura Jill","['Fonteyn, L.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Previous research suggests that psychopathy can also show in language, as “to use language is to engage in a social process” (Holtgraves, 2014). At present, many linguists believe that the analysis of language can offer some insights into underlying cognitive and emotional processes (Pennebaker, Mehl, & Niederhoffer, 2003). More specifically, word choices can function as subtle indicators of underlying psychopathy (Jughaenel, Smyth, & Santner, 2008, as cited in Le et al. 2017). Research by Hancock, Woodworth, and Boochever (2015) shows that there are linguistics tendencies discovered during the use of different communication mediums (like email, text messaging, Facebook, and Twitter), that are unique for ‘darker personalities’ (such as individuals with psychopathy or psychopathic tendencies). Unfortunately, there is a lack of research regarding fictional killers such as Dexter and Joe, who seem to fit the profile of the sociopathic/psychopathic killer, and whether they share these language tendencies. Therefore, this thesis will explore the language use of both Dexter and Joe, both in conversational speech as well as in their voice over narration, and aims to establish the truthfulness of their language tendencies. If this were to be established, it could suggest that script writers also take into account linguistic behavior rather than just social behavior, which would contribute to the authenticity of television characters.","['Language tendencies', 'serial killers', 'television studies', 'Dexter', 'You']"

Er wordt betoogd dat de meeste van de rijken een ontwikkelend opvolgingssysteem kenden, doordat de nadruk op de doorslaggevende factoren voor het praktisch verloop van een opvolging veranderde. Naar voren komt dat in alle rijken de factoren afstamming, aanwijzing, verkiezing en strijd van belang waren voor de invulling van het opvolgingssysteem. Voor de bestudeerde rijken geld ook dat de (op elkaar inwerkende) invloed van de islam en Turks-Mongoolse traditie, belangrijk waren voor de vorm die de opvolging kreeg. De analyse stoelt vooral op primaire bronnen voor het onderzoek naar Mughal-India en op secundaire bronnen met betrekking tot de verwante rijken. Hierbij biedt Jack Goody's opvolgingstheorie een kader aan de hand waarvan de ontwikkeling van de opvolgingssystemen wordt beschreven. Daarnaast is er specifieke aandacht voor de rol die de vrouwen van de dynastieën hadden met betrekking tot de vorming en verandering van de opvolgingssystemen. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat de vrouwelijke invloed soms van doorslaggevend belang kon zijn voor de verandering van een opvolgingssysteem.","['Mogol', 'opvolging', 'erfopvolging', 'vergelijkend', 'Midden-Oosten', 'India', 'Turks-Mongools']"

This agreement, the Periphery Pact (‘Pact’), was initiated by Israel who was anxious to establish relationships with countries on the periphery of the ring of hostile Arab countries that encircled it. The Pact signatories, engaged in a diplomatic marketing initiative to sell the Pact to their Cold War sponsor, the United States in the belief that US support for the Pact was beneficial. Existing research tells us little about how the United States reacted to this sales pitch or what US policy was towards the Pact. My research of the US diplomatic archives indicate that the US response to the Periphery Pact arrangements was decidedly lukewarm. This appears inconsistent with US regional policy which was to stimulate the creation of regional defense arrangements by its regional allies to counter Soviet threats to the region. I argue that the response of the United States to the Pact may not be a complete surprise if analyzed in the light of the US response to the Baghdad Pact, a contemporaneous defense arrangement in the region. I also investigate how the US intelligence services reacted to the Pact. This aspect of the US policy towards the Pact is under-researched. This is surprising given Israel’s track record in clandestine diplomacy and its use of its regional intelligence gathering capabilities as an argument when marketing the Periphery Pact to US officials. My research indicates that the CIA displayed more interest in and provided resources to the intelligence sharing mechanism of the Periphery Pact. It may well be that the United States used clandestine diplomacy in parallel, rather than as a substitute, for normal diplomatic channels.","['Periphery Pact', 'US Policy', 'Cold War', 'Middle East', 'Eisenhower Administration']"

Dit zorgde voor een zekere speelruimte voor zowel de keizer als de katholieken en de donatisten. Verder was het de vraag hoe interne conflicten moesten worden opgelost. Er was wel een standaardroute beschikbaar via het petition-response mechanisme, maar dat was zelf veelvormig, en het was niet vanzelfsprekend dat het überhaupt werd gebruikt. Het lijkt erop dat de vorming van identiteit door een textual community en het aangaan van een juridische strijd bij de totstandkoming van wetgeving elkaar ondersteunden. Door een juridische zaak aan te gaan was identiteit nodig ter onderbouwing. Tegelijkertijd werd door de juridische onderbouwing de identiteit steeds meer afgebakend. Daarom wordt in dit onderzoek de volgende hoofdvraag gesteld: hoe gebruikten de verschillende partijen in het donatistische schisma het formele juridische bestel en identiteitsformatie om hun bestaansrecht te legitimeren?","['Late antieke oudheid', 'identiteitsvorming pressiegroepen', 'juridische procedures', 'manipulatie van officiële documenten (fake news)']"

Vrouwen met een wetenschappelijke achtergrond in online berichtgeving. Onderzoek naar representatie van vrouwen met een wetenschappelijke achtergrond in online berichtgeving van de grootste Nederlandse nieuwsmedia,"Harthoorn, Jannet","['Burger, J.P.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"“Women rights are human rights” of “the future is female”, dit zijn inmiddels veel gehoorde uitspraken. Er is steeds meer aandacht voor gelijkheid tussen vrouwen en mannen. Ook diversiteit in de media is erg belangrijk, schrijven Hoks & Eliasar (2017), diversiteit zorgt voor een meer open blik en acceptatie van diverse standpunten van verschillende groepen. Bovendien is het de taak van de media het goede voorbeeld te geven: wanneer media bestaande verschillen versterken en bevestigen, zal dit bijdragen aan genderongelijkheid (Segijn, et al., 2014: 309). Naar gelijkheid tussen vrouwen en mannen is al veel onderzoek gedaan, zowel in Nederland als in het buitenland. Deze onderzoeken gingen over de aanwezigheid van vrouwen in de media, maar ook over de aanwezigheid van vrouwelijke wetenschappers in de media. Bij eerder uitgevoerd onderzoek werden vooral offline uitingen onderzocht. Zoals aanwezigheid van vrouwelijke wetenschappers in de krant, op tv of in wetenschappelijke magazines. In deze scriptie wordt onderzoek gedaan naar de online berichtgeving van de drie grootste Nederland- se nieuwsmedia onderzocht op representativiteit. Het doel van dit onderzoek is een beeld krijgen van hoe de verhouding tussen vrouwen en mannen in online berichtgeving van de grootste Nederlandse nieuwsmedia is. Maar vooral hoe de vrouw met wetenschappelijke achtergrond wordt gerepresenteerd in online berichtgeving en inzicht krijgen in hoe representatief de grootste Nederlandse nieuwsmedia zijn. Om hier achter te komen is voor deze scriptie de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: Hoe worden vrouwen met een wetenschappelijke achtergrond gerepresenteerd in online berichtgeving van de grootste Nederlandse nieuwsmedia? Dit wordt in deze scriptie onderzocht door middel van kwantitatieve en exploratieve kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse. De kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse is uitgevoerd door middel van een zogeheten samengestelde week. Berichten uit een periode van 30 juni t/m 31 december 2019 zijn onderzocht. Bij de exploratieve inhoudsanalyse wordt in de gevonden data gezocht naar patronen en overeenkomsten. De inhoudsanalyse toont aan dat vrouwen in online berichtgeving veel minder aan het woord zijn dan mannen. Van de gevonden rollen werd 63% gevuld door mannen en 20% door vrouwen. Vrouwen zijn in alle onderzochte rollen minder aan het woord dan mannen, het hoogste aandeel vrouwen is 30%, namelijk in een rol als prominent persoon of journalist. Ook zijn vrouwen minder in beeld bij online berichtgeving dan mannen. Bovendien zijn vrou- wen anders in beeld dan mannen, blijkt uit de exploratieve kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse. Vrouwen zijn vaak meer close-up, meer casual gekleed en minder vaak in een werksetting in beeld dan mannen. Van het aantal personen met een wetenschappelijke achtergrond was meer dan drie kwart van de personen mannelijk en iets meer dan een kwart (19%) vrouwelijk. Ook de manier van presenteren van vrouwen met een wetenschappelijke achtergrond verschilt met die van mannen. Mannen worden vaker bij hun achternaam genoemd en de functie van mannen wordt vaker genoemd. Vrouwen worden juist vaker ook bij hun voornaam genoemd. Dit betekent dat vrouwen met een wetenschappelijke achtergrond niet goed gerepresenteerd en gepresenteerd worden in online bericht- geving van de drie grootste Nederlandse nieuwsmedia. Sterker nog, van geen enkele andere onderzochte rol is er sprake van representativiteit in de nieuwsmedia. De verhoudingen tussen vrouwen en mannen aan het woord en in beeld in online berichtgeving zijn scheef en deze komen niet in de buurt van de werkelijke verhoudingen in Nederland. Een eventueel vervolgonderzoek naar vrouwen met een wetenschappelijke achtergrond in online berichtgeving, kan zich richten op het verzamelen van data via social media, hierbij kan dan ook meer visuele data verzameld worden. Voor het vervolgonderzoek is het dan ook belangrijk om data te verzamelen van alle nieuwsmedia uit Nederland. Zo kan het corpus veel verder worden uitgebreid en ontstaat een vollediger beeld.","['journalism', 'representation', 'news', 'woman', 'feminism']"

Specifically, I explore the argument whether the New Order elites' historical experience of a bureaucratic Dutch colonial state can explain the New Order government's emphasis on agriculture. I argue that the existing state in the Indonesian archipelago in either period may not be as strongly bureaucratic as previously thought, that the argument of the New Order elites' historical experience of a bureaucratic Dutch colonial state may not explain the New Order government's emphasis on agriculture, and that both regimes' approaches to agricultural development may not be viewed entirely as state-led. These conclusions call for a reassessment of the existing state in the Indonesian archipelago in both periods together with a shift from state-centred to state-society approaches.","['agricultural development', 'New Order government', 'Suharto', 'Dutch colonial regime', 'Ethical policy', 'modern state']"

Yet not much research has been conducted that can easily be replicated. In this study, the method by Van Poucke (2017) is used to find out if the first translation of 1984 by George Orwell has aged. 1984 was chosen because of the relevance that it still has and because it can add to the limited research that has been done on retranslating science fiction. Two Dutch translations were analysed, namely the first translation by Kool (1950) and the second and most recent translation by Davids (1984). The first chapter of the two translations was analysed to find out if lexical and stylistic aging could be found. Furthermore, the translations were analysed on the aging of technological concepts. Van Poucke’s method was used, because it is the leading method that operationalizes the research of aging. The findings show that lexical aging could not be determined in the first translation. For stylistic aging, much more evidence was found. After conducting this research, it can be concluded some evidence has been found that the first translation of 1984 has indeed aged and the aging of the first translation could have been a reason for retranslating the novel.","['retranslation', 'orwell', 'aging', 'translation']"
"""Doos waarop je 'n deksel doet"" or ""Hinde, een hert, een vrouwelijk hert""? Subtitling Movie Musicals Logocentrically or Musicocentrically","Dam, Marike van","['Dorst, A.G.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The research undertaken in this thesis was aimed at researching whether “logocentric” subtitles – literal, word-by-word translations – and “musicocentric” subtitles – translations that take rhyme, rhythm, singability, sense, and naturalness into account – of songs in English-language live action movie musicals would be appreciated equally by Dutch viewers. Because of the “gossiping effect” (Törnqvist, 1995) – which makes viewers react negatively to subtitles that do not show what they hear being said – the expectation was that viewers would appreciate logocentric subtitles more, as musicocentric subtitles would likely be deemed “wrong” by Dutch viewers with a command of the English language as they are not literal translations of the lyrics. The research used Franzon’s (2008) concepts of logocentric and musicocentric translation and Low’s (2003, 2005) “pentathlon principle” to create logocentric and musicocentric subtitles for excerpts from songs of four English-language live action movie musicals: Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Burton, 2007), Les Misérables (Hooper, 2012), The Sound of Music (Wise, 1965), and West Side Story (Robbins & Wise, 1961). These excerpts – two of which were subtitled logocentrically and two of which were subtitled musicocentrically – were then shown to a sample of 90 respondents through the use of a survey. The survey asked the respondents to report – for each excerpt – whether they thought the subtitles were good, and how they would rate the subtitles. The respondents overwhelmingly reported that the logocentric subtitles were good, and that the musicocentric subtitles were not good; they also rated the logocentric subtitles high, and the musicocentric subtitles low. Thus, the logocentric and musicocentric subtitles were not appreciated equally: the logocentric subtitles were appreciated more, an outcome the gossiping effect likely influenced. As logocentric subtitles appear to be more appreciated, and easier to create, an implication of this research could be that Dutch subtitlers should create logocentric subtitles for songs in English-language live action movie musicals.","['movie musical', 'subtitle', 'logocentric', 'musicocentric']"

The Great American Novel: Writing National Identity,"Engelen, Gijs van","['Bilt, Eduard van de', 'Gaskill, Nicholas (Oxford University)']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the tradition of the Great American Novel (GAN). Against current academic trends, this literary canon is not understood to safeguard conservative hegemonies. Here, it is rather studied as an ongoing discourse that has questioned ostensible certainties in American national identity throughout the twentieth century. A select number of GANs are shown to have survived in the canon for decades, and to share an even more select number of archetypes which the novels consistently problematise. The continued resonance of these narratives is argued to be indicative of inherent ambiguities that fester on in American identity as cultural unfinished business. An added relevance is the fact that those uncertainties cropped up precisely during periods when US nationalism seemed to peak, a pattern that forms a surprising, alternative cultural history. The term “Great American Novel” was coined in 1868 by John William DeForest, who called for realist American novels to equal European ones, and to present an imagined US community that overcame post-Civil War regional divisions. Ever since, the tradition has been alluring to American authors seeking to establish their cultural weight. Yet the canon as we know it today only took shape after the confidence-boosting outcome of the First World War, when critics and academics renounced the European, realist ideals of their predecessors in favour of “Romance”, a symbolical style which they claimed had always been the basis of literary American exceptionalism. Retroactively, The Scarlet Letter, Moby-Dick and Huckleberry Finn were canonised as the Romance-edifice, as if they had always been just that. Their archetypes, namely individualism, the American Dream and the frontier spirit, together became a national mythology of sorts, so successful was this invented tradition. Soon it was so familiar, that subsequent authors who sought to reflect on American identity could do so by alluding to those three ultimate GANs. The canon thus became an ongoing discourse, a cultural conversation in which a limited set of rules and clichés were contemplated as national roots. Authors from the Great Depression were the first to demonstrate this. They took the three tropes mentioned, and superimposed them onto topical stories of economic hardship. GANs from the era thus romanticised the canonical archetypes as the eternal foundations of American exceptionalism, precisely by linking their betrayal to contemporary, “un-American” injustices. The years following the Second World War, by contrast, saw such a boost to national confidence that they were named a “Golden Age.” Yet a new generation of authors showed its teeth by digging up GAN-archetypes and weaponizing them, especially those related to frontier-adventurism, against contemporary ideals of dull material comfort. Indeed, the canon’s role as underminer of cultural certainties became fixed in these years. Hence the nadir in GAN-output amid the blows to American superiority of the 1960s and 1970s: the eras of Vietnam and Watergate required no reminding of American problems. The Reaganist 1980s did, however. Especially black authors began to attack Americans’ sense of innocence regarding their history, by again returning to the GANs’ archetypes: taken as the roots of US exceptionalism, they were rewritten as shared traumas. Far from weakening the canon’s position, this attack on its traditions actually revitalised its function as ongoing discourse. Consequently, the 1990s saw more (critically acclaimed) GAN-attempts than any other decade. Within them, authors indicated how the end of the Cold War not only boosted American exceptionalism, but also left it without a signifying Other, and thus without direction and narrative. Again, cultural confidence in the wake of a victory in a major global conflict was being undermined by GANs’ exposing hidden ambivalences in national mythology. The GAN’s imagined community has always destabilised American certainties. The canon forms a surprising, alternative cultural history, in which anxieties invisible in other histories come to the fore, precisely when one would least expect them to. Understanding canons as mere conservative bastions is thus argued to be highly reductive, and damaging to their rich analytical promise in cultural analysis.

Are Black Americans Facing Genocide? A Study of Policing Practices in the United States,"Sadrizadeh, Sara","['Regilme, S.S.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Police brutality in the United States has sparked a national outcry, as this year again far too many black people have fallen victim to police shootings. Though activists have been advocating for change and scholars have examined the current flawed system, they have not studied the black struggle from a contemporary genocide lens. This thesis examines American policing practices in lights of genocide, and it offers a brief history of policing practices and slavery, as well as discusses the various findings of African American Studies scholar. This thesis shows how after decades of slavery there are still genocidal tendencies in the police force, which is analysed through Stanton’s stages of genocide, as well as notions of indirect genocide. The findings indicate that policing practices pass the first six stages of Stanton, classification, symbolisation, discrimination, dehumanisation, organisation and polarisation. Though fortunately, not all stages have been realised, this thesis wishes to elucidate the deeply entrenched racial biases that are causing unbearable living situations for black Americans and to listen to those who have been silenced over the years.","['genocide', 'race', 'policy', 'police practices', 'Stanton', 'state violence']"

Of Dictators and Disasters: Examining authoritarian regimes’ obstruction of humanitarian aid following natural disasters,"Johnstone, Alistair","['Maat, E. Van der']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Natural disasters pose a unique threat to authoritarian regimes because they can bring existing failures within the structure of governance into sharp relief, thus legitimising the grievances of rebel groups and increasing the risk of civil conflict. Most regimes therefore attempt to ensure humanitarian aid is secured and distributed, to mitigate such damages. Why then, do some regimes obstruct or deny humanitarian aid if doing so may incur costs to the regime? This thesis solves this puzzle by investigating the cases of the Bhola Cyclone in East Pakistan in 1970 and Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar in 2008 and assessing whether each of four key factors were observable in either case. The four factors are: ethnic and ideological differences; a fear of foreign intervention; elite rivalry; and the exit strategy of the military dictator. This analysis leads to several interesting conclusions. First, ethnic or ideological differences are not enough motivation for a regime to incur the costs of obstructing aid. Second, regimes will deny or obstruct foreign aid if they believe doing so will lead to a decreased risk of civil conflict. Third, elite rivalry may manipulate the regime’s leadership into acting against its own best interests. Finally, authoritarian leaders will prioritise their own exit strategy over the need to prevent untold numbers of civilian deaths.","['authoritarian', 'natural disaster', 'humanitarian aid', 'selective violence', 'East Pakistan', 'Bhola cyclone', 'Myanmar', 'Cyclone Nargis', 'Elite Rivalry', 'Democratic transition']"

"The Dutch East India Company and the Rice Economy of Java, 1743-1800","Wahyu Pratiwi, Yuanita","['Bes, L.P.J.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Even though the Dutch East India Company (VOC) came to Asia for Asian luxury products, in Java, their main drive was a bulk, rice, which was used as the operational cost for its empire in Asia. After a series of wars in the past century, in 1743, the VOC managed to establish control over the majority of rice producing area in Java. This responsibility oftentimes set the VOC as the ultimate cause of the deteriorating of the once flourishing rice economy of Java. However, the accusation experienced strong challenges from the established studies telling about prosperity in the second half of 18th century Java and VOC’s minimal intervention to the island’s rice economy. This thesis examined the contradiction through an exploration towards VOC’s trading document such as the general ledger, correspondence, and reports. In the end it argues that however thin was VOC’s influence to the system, the impact was devastating for Java’s rice economy. Since 1743, VOC asked for 5000 koyangs rice, which was more than a half of Java’s total surplus from a particular region named pasisir which made only 35% of the total rice producing area in Java. This thesis also argued that in the second half of 18th century, different parts of Java experienced different states of economy. The hinterland, under the ex-Mataram states was prosperous because they did not have to bear the 5000 koyangs annual obligatory delivery, while in pasisir, workload increased without proper compensation. This phenomenon in pasisir led to the rapid growth of population, rapid deforestation for constructing rice field, for a mere stagnant surplus. The obligatory delivery cut a considerable income of the pasisir’s rice farmer, left them with no relaxation on their budget that initially could make room for innovation and technological advancement, which were why, in the 18th century pasisir rice farmer re-practiced frugal extensification as what their ancestor did eight century ago.","['VOC', 'rice', 'rice economy', 'food policy', 'Java', 'pasisir']"

Bellucci'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2015, all UN member states adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. In this agenda, a blueprint was created which outlined a pathway for planetary peace and prosperity consisting of 17 goals named the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG three (3), Good Health and Wellbeing, seeks to “Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all ages”. The SDGs are of global relevance, however nowhere more so than the emerging markets where they are used by countless international organizations, development finance institutes, NGO’s, and more, to justify and measure the success of investments, programs, and projects, at the human level. One widely discussed and key barrier between SDGs being achieved and the current position, is the availability of the capital and technical skills required to fund and build hospitals, solar farms, water treatment plants, and the myriad of other large-scale infrastructure upon which the health and wellbeing of a nation rests. This issue has been dubbed the infrastructure deficit, and according to the UN, reducing both the technical shortfalls and the USD 67.9 billion per annum financial shortfall which underly it is key to securing Africa’s long term sustainable growth. Using a case study approach focussed on two counties in Kenya, this paper evaluates a potential solution to Africa's infrastructure problem in the form of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).","['Health', 'Africa', 'Blended Finance']"
Mediating Memory Through Iconic Holocaust Literature: Commodification of Memory Through Popular Culture's Testimonies,"Griffiths, Siân",['Dr Bram Ieven'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The platitude of “it’s a small world” has truly gained in meaning, to the point of some fearing the loss of their cultural sovereignty. Our cultures, identities and sense of belonging have been meshed together, from the sheer accessibility of the internet and the impossibly large array of information available to everyone. Memory has not been exempt to this new rule, as culture and memory have always been intrinsically linked, as memory oftentimes shapes artistic endeavours, and memory relies on culture for mediation and to remain relevant. Indeed, memory has become an increasingly prominent topic in the study of humanities and the social sciences, as it has become so complex that it cannot be entirely understood through the unidisciplinary methods of traditional memory studies. The fallout of this common cultural identity and memory is that representations of certain events are propelled into the global stage, through methods of mass media, and become essential to perpetuate and maintain memory.",

"The Mughal succession crisis and the diplomatic strategies of the VOC in Surat, circa 1699 - 1719: The impact of the death of Aurangzeb on the Dutch East India Company’s approach to solving local problems in Surat","Pepping, Kay","['Bes, L.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to examine how the reliance of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) on the mutasaddi (governor) of the imperial harbour town of Surat differed between the governorship of Diânat Khan (1699-1701) and the governorship of Haider Quli Khan (1716-1719). As the years surrounding the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707 saw local mutasaddi strengthen their position, the VOC reconsidered its approach to problem-solving. The comparison between these two governorships makes it clear that the VOC displayed a clear preference for a local solution negotiated with the governor. During the governorship of Diânat Khan, reaching out to the emperor was still considered as an option. However, it was seen as a more expensive and less effective alternative that required support from local government officials to work. Two decades later during the governorship of Haider Quli Khan, the VOC made it clear that they had lost faith in the emperor’s authority within Surat. They relied more heavily on the governor than before for matters of security, trade and conflict-resolution. Examining these periods shows that the VOC dealt with a much wider range of officials than often assumed, preferred the efficiency of a deal with the governor over a deal with the emperor, and worked with local government to approach the emperor when local authority was not enough to solve an issue.","['VOC', 'Dutch East India Company', 'Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie', 'Company Diplomacy', 'Provincial Diplomacy', 'Mughals', 'Surat', 'Zwaardecroon', 'Diânat Khan', 'Haider Quli Khan', 'Local diplomacy', 'Early Modern', 'Governor', 'Mutasaddi', 'Diplomacy']"
Of Fasces and Fascists: On the Role of Aesthetics in the Development of 20th-Century Italian Fascist Ideology,"Rowland, Thomas","['McAllister, James']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"This project explores the relation between 20th century Italian Fascist ideology and aesthetics, investigating the influence of the latter in the development of the former. To this end relevant literature, speeches, manifestos, and figures are consulted . I contend that aesthetics held a significant role, directly affecting the formation and development of Fascist ideology. However, I further argue that aesthetics was not the nature of Fascism, only an important tool. Socio-political developments lead to my conclusion that aesthetics was a significant component of Fascism which imploded under political pressures in the 1930’s, becoming subservient to an ideological component best interpreted as a civic religion. As such, I dismantle the intuitive notion that aesthetics were simply reflective, with artists as coerced mouthpieces of a totalitarian regime. But I also dismantle the modern academic consensus that Fascism is inherently aesthetic – a politics of spectacle. This project therefore provides a theory on the relation of aesthetics and Fascist ideology, further illuminating the nature of Fascism and outlining how politics can be aestheticized – plus the potential dangers of this.","['Aesthetics', 'Fascism', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'History']"

The Perception of Dutch Fluency: a qualitative examination of fluency ratings on native and nonnative speech,"Haverman, Daya","['Jong, N.H. de']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"In fluency research that contains rating experiments, it is often the case that either a) overall proficiency is examined, and participants are free to rate fluency intuitively; or b) participants are told to base their judgments on several utterance fluency characteristics, since the researcher studiesfluency in the narrow sense. In this study, I examine whether there are more speech factors that fall under the concept of fluency in the narrow sense than only the fluency characteristics that the participants are given prior to a rating task. Qualitative research into the perception of fluency on Dutch native and nonnative speech gave 17 different categories that participants take into account when judging spontaneous speech. Then, two groups of participants were juxtaposed: one group that had to judge fluency based on four utterance fluency characteristics (explicit group); and one group that only received a definition of cognitive fluency and was free to base their judgments on their own interpretation of this definition (implicit group). Results indicate that the implicit group was less likely to let disfluencies influence them negatively, but was more inclined to unconsciously judge overall proficiency rather than fluency in the narrow sense. Additionally, both groups showed a sensitivity for pause distribution that helped them to determine the speaker’s ease of lexical retrieval. I conclude that intonation and planning efficiency are essential components of fluency in the narrow sense, and should therefore be used in the instructions for future rating experiments.","['fluency', 'disfluencies', 'fluency judgments', 'speech perception', 'speech rate', 'silent pausing']"

Intersprachlicher Einfluss beim Tertiärsprachenlernen: Eine syntaktische und lexikalische Studie,"Zoutendijk, Ineke","['Audring, J.', 'Jong, N.H. de']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,de,"Das Thema dieser Arbeit ist intersprachlicher Einfluss bei Tertiärsprachenlernen. Dieses Thema wird sowohl praktisch (anhand der Ergebnisse durchgeführter Tests in den Bereichen der Syntax und der Lexik) als theoretisch (anhand anderer veröffentlichter Studien im Fachgebiet) ausgearbeitet. Der erste Abschnitt bietet eine Einführung und definiert wichtige Begriffe zum Thema. Eine Tertiärsprache ist in dieser Arbeit jede Fremdsprache, die nach der ersten Zweitsprache angeeignet wird. Eine relevante Frage ist die nach dem Unterschied zwischen second und third language acquisition; das Faktorenmodell von Hufeisen bietet hier eine mögliche Erklärung. Im zweiten Abschnitt steht das Thema cross linguistic influence (die in der internationalen Literatur übliche Bezeichnung für Transfer oder intersprachlichen Einfluss) im Mittelpunkt. In den letzten Jahrzehnten sind verschiedene Modelle vorgeschlagen worden, um die Wirkung von Transfer zu beschreiben. Drei einflussreiche Theorien werden näher erklärt: (a) das CEM (Cumulative Enhancement Model) betrachtet alle vorher erworbenen oder gelernten Sprachen als mögliche Transferquelle für die Tertiärsprache; (b) die LSFH (L2 Status Factor-Hypothese) sieht hier eine privilegierte Rolle für die Zweitsprache wegen deren besonderen Status; (c) das TPM (Typology Primacy Model) hält den (psycho-)typologischen Abstand für den entscheidenden Faktor beim Auftreten von intersprachlichem Einfluss. Der dritte Abschnitt stellt die Methodologie der bei einer Gruppe von niederländischen Deutschlernenden durchgeführten Untersuchung dar. Die Probanden haben Englisch als L2 und lassen sich betreffs ihrer Tertiärsprache auf zwei Sprachniveaus einstufen: GER-Niveau A1/A2 bzw. A2/B1. Der vorgelegte Fragebogen ist ein grammaticality judgement task und besteht aus zwei Teilen, einem syntaktischen und einem lexikalischen. Im syntaktischen Teil wird intersprachlicher Transfer bei der Reihenfolge im deutschen Satz untersucht; die deutsche und die niederländische Sprache unterscheiden sich in dieser Hinsicht vom Englischen mit seiner strikten Subjekt-Verb-Objekt-Struktur. Die Hypothese ist, dass hier Transfer aus der L2 (Englisch) auftreten wird. Der lexikalische Teil hat feste Verbindungen von Verben mit Präpositionen zum Thema; es gibt mehrere Verben, die sich im Deutschen und im Niederländischen mit den entsprechenden Präpositionen verbinden, im Englischen jedoch eine andere Präposition brauchen. Die Hypothese lautet, dass hier ebenfalls Transfer aus der L2 stattfindet. Im vierten Abschnitt werden die Ergebnisse der Untersuchung dargestellt und anhand anderer wissenschaftlicher Studien im Fachgebiet diskutiert. Die Ergebnisse weisen im Allgemeinen auf Transfer aus der L2 hin und bestätigen deshalb beide Hypothesen und somit die LSFH. Trotzdem gibt es erhebliche Unterschiede zwischen den Niveaugruppen und den Sprachbereichen. Die Ergebnisse der Probanden auf dem höchsten Sprachniveau sind beim syntaktischen und lexikalischen Teil des Tests genau gleich, während bei den anderen Teilnehmern die Scores im lexikalischen Teil deutlich niedriger als im syntaktischen Teil sind. Daraus lässt sich schließen, dass intersprachlicher Einfluss bei Anfängern in der Tertiärsprache in den Bereichen Syntax und Lexik nicht auf gleiche Weise stattfindet. Neurolinguistische Theorien über die Wirkung des deklarativen und prozeduralen Gedächtnisses im Gehirn bieten eine mögliche Erklärung für diesen Unterschied. Eine erworbene L1 wird danach im prozeduralen Gedächtnis gespeichert und unbewusst aktiviert, während die später gelernten Fremdsprachen (L2, L3 usw.) im deklarativen Gedächtnis gespeichert und daraus bewusst abgerufen werden. Bei Anfängern in der Tertiärsprache funktioniere die unbewusste Aktivierung der Sprache noch nicht, und verlaufe die Aktivierung also über das deklarative Gedächtnis, in dem sich außer der L3 auch die L2-Kenntnisse befinden; die L2 sei deshalb eine logische Transferquelle beim Tertiärsprachenlernen.","['third language acquisition', 'Tertiärsprachenlernen', 'second language acquisition', 'Fremdsprachenlernen', 'Faktorenmodell', 'Transfer', 'intersprachlicher Einfluss', 'cross-linguistic influence']"

The influence of motivation on second language proficiency: the implementation of the fortis/lenis contrast by vowel length,"Geerdink, Eva",['D. A. Smakman'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis set out to identify how motivation as a factor in second language acquisition influences the proficiency in signaling the fortis/lenis contrast by vowel length. Although earlier research on the influence of motivation on (oral) second language proficiency has already been performed, the connection between motivation and vowel length in particular has not yet been made and is therefore innovative. In a phonetic study, vowel durations in the speech of 10 Dutch students of English Language & Culture were acoustically measured. Thereafter, the same participants expressed their motivation for learning English as a second language in a motivation questionnaire. Results showed that, generally, speakers cued the contrast by vowel length, as they all produced longer durations for pre-lenis than pre-fortis vowels. However, variations in proficiency could be observed, with some participants realising a greater contrast than others. The results also showed that the speakers were motivated to learn English for different reasons, some of them being more or equally integratively and/or instrumentally motivated. Finally, no obvious relationships were found between proficiency in the implementation of the contrast by vowel length and the two types of motivation. Further research could possibly expose possible evident connections, and therefore proves fruitful.","['fortis', 'lenis', 'contrast', 'vowel', 'length', 'motivation']"
"Out of A Crocodile’s Mouth, Enter A Tiger’s Snout: Kingship in Cirebon and the Dutch East India Company’s Intervention in the Late Seventeenth Century","Rahadi, Satrio Dwicahyo",['Dr. Lennart Bes'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the authority and the power of kingship under the Cirebon kings under the context of the alliance between the trifurcated sultanate of Cirebon with the Dutch East India Company (or the VOC). Authority and power are two pillars of kingship that operated in different but intertwining realms. The former deals with the legitimacy that is either top-down descending on the king from a transcendent source and/or ascending from the bottom up by his “subjects.” By corroborating Cirebonese manuscripts and VOC archives, this study indicates that an ideal Cirebon sultan upheld spiritual commitments more than material achievements. When VOC’s interest to meddle in local politics grew, the company attempted to subjugate Cirebon through a series of treaties that detached the sultans from powers. However, the Cirebon sultans and the VOC had a different notion of power. Detachment from the material world allowed the Cirebon sultans to commit to spiritual endeavors. As shown by Cirebon’s founding father, Sunan Gunung Jati, an ideal king positioned Islam as the fulcrum of his universe. Thus, VOC’s entrenchment over Cirebon helped Sultan Sepuh I, Sultan Anom I, and Panembahan Kacirebonan to be ideal rulers. An idea which the company barely showed any interest in. This study accessed both Cirebonese chronicles and annals and documents produced by the VOC stored in The Hague and Jakarta. By delving into the sources, the present study presents a case study of the interaction between a local entity with the VOC as a colonial force that annuls the simplistic view of the anti-colonial history.","['Kingship', 'Cirebon', 'VOC', 'Islamic Kingship', 'Javanese Kingship', 'Cirebonese Kingship', 'Early Modern Indonesia', 'Colonialism']"

"The Emblematic Elephant: Elephants, the Dutch East India Company, and Eurasian Diplomacy in the Seventeenth Century","Naisupap, Pichayapat","['Gommans, Jos']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"When the Dutch East India Company (VOC) came to Asia, its presence was contingent on relations with Asian polities. Elephant gift-giving was one of the practices the VOC conducted and experienced with Asian rulers alongside trade. The VOC acted as a giver and a receiver; it received gift-elephants from Southeast Asian polities plus Kandy and transferred them westward. This study examines the Dutch-Asian elephant diplomacy and sociocultural foundations behind the diplomatic scene during the seventeenth century. It argues that the existing Dutch acknowledgment of elephant gift-giving traditions and imaginations and perceptions of the emblematic elephant facilitated the elephant diplomacy between the VOC and Asian polities. In other words, these mentalities were integral to the commensurability in the Dutch-Asian elephant gift-giving. Furthermore, the case of the emblematic elephant imagined and perceived by the Dutch shows that the seventeenth-century historical change in worldview from emblematic to empirical was more nuanced and not linear.","['Dutch', 'VOC', 'Elephant', 'Diplomacy', 'Gift-giving', 'Emblematic']"

Christian democratic solidarity with the weak: A study of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA)’s attitude towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (1980-2010),"Alders, Sjoerd","['Ben Aharon, E.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores how the Christian Democratic Appeal’s (CDA) attitude towards the Israeli- Palestinian conflict has affected the party’s understanding of its key principle solidarity during its most prominent years in government between 1980 and 2010. By analyzing primary source material in the form of personal statements from key CDA members, election programs and official party documentation, it focusses on two aspects of the CDA’s identity: (1) its membership of a family of Christian democratic parties, whose political identity is based on an explicit appeal to Christian values in general; and (2) its primary objective of both “nationally and internationally appealing to the responsibility of the strong to show solidarity with the weak” as laid out in the party’s Statement of Principles in 1980. This thesis concludes that the CDA, throughout its years in government, has been gradually drifting away from these aspects of its Christian democratic identity, because of (1) the CDA’s core principle of solidarity being originally inspired by Catholic social doctrine, (2) the Israel-Palestine conflict having been an internally dividing topic ever since the start of the CDA, and (3) the increasing support of the secular vote having made the party’s successes possible in the first place. This combination of factors has often made room for circumstances in which not always the content of the party’s foundational Statement of Principles was of the utmost priority. Moreover, it has often resulted in a negligence of the protection of those Christian values and traditions in places where Christian solidarity was actually needed the most. While this research gives an interesting insight into the CDA’s developing understanding of solidarity towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, future research on the connection between Christian democratic politics and threatened Christian communities in the rest of the world might be a welcome addition to the discussion.","['christianity', 'christian democracy', 'solidarity', 'israel', 'palestine', 'minorities', 'international relations', 'contemporary politics', 'dutch politics']"

Lacking Support for Poor Elderly: Explaining the High Elderly Work Rates in South Korea,"Alfons, Chaquela","['Green, Christopher']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Koreanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Despite having a relatively small elderly population, South Korea's elderly poverty rate outranks that of all other countries with 43.8 percent of all elderly people living in poverty. Moreover, the Korean elderly are poorer than all other age groups. To make up for this inequality, one third of the elderly population stays active on the labour market. This study examines how changes in family dynamics, current social welfare programmes and pension policies explain this high elderly workforce participation rate. To do so, it uses secondary literature, analyses government reports and laws in addition to statistics published by databanks of the OECD and Statistics Korea, among others. In order to understand the importance of this analysis, the Korean case is brought into world context by comparing it with Japan and the Netherlands. This study found that Korea's current elderly support system is unbalanced and has not yet reached its full potential: the combination of shifting household structures and the immature pension system leaves the elderly with a weak safety net that fails to keep them from living below the poverty line.","['South Korea', 'Elderly', 'Elderly poverty', 'Household structure', 'Pension system', 'Elderly workforce participation', 'Filial piety', 'Multi-generational households']"

In hoeverre kan de Werkstijl Hervormingswet slagen in het bewerkstelligen van een balans tussen werk en privéleven om karōshi en karōjisatsu in Japan te voorkomen?,"Koning, Jessica Denise","[""Visser 't Hooft, Willem""]",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In Japan staat het overlijden en zelfmoord plegen als gevolg van te hard werken bekend als karōshi en karōjisatsu. Deze fenomenen komen niet uitsluitend in Japan voor, maar hetgeen wat wel uniek is voor Japan is dat karōshi en karōjisatsu in het recht voorkomen. Ter preventie van karōshi en karōjisatsu heeft de Japanse regering afgelopen jaar (2019) een nieuwe wet ingevoerd, genaamd ""Werkstijl Hervormingswet"". In deze scriptie ga ik kijken in hoeverre de Werkstijl Hervormingswet kan slagen in het bewerkstelligen van een balans tussen werk en privéleven om karōshi en karōjisatsu in Japan te voorkomen. Eerst richt ik mij op de totstandkoming van de Werkstijl Hervormingswet en de inhoud van de maatregelen in deze wet. Vervolgens focus ik mij op de sociaal-culturele, economische en politieke factoren die van invloed zijn op de effectiviteit van de toepassing van de Werkstijl Hervormingswet in de Japanse samenleving. Hierin bespreek ik de Japanse bedrijfscultuur, het werkgelegenheidssysteem en de beleidsvorming.","['Karōshi', 'Karōjisatsu', 'Werkstijl Hervormingswet', 'Japan', 'Werkcultuur', 'Bedrijfscultuur', 'Werkgelegenheidssysteem', 'Beleidsvorming', 'Overwerk']"
