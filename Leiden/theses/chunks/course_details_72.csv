Belarus's maneuverability within Russian-led Eurasian economic integration,"Feij, Geoffroy","['Skalamera, Morena']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"It is commonly argued that Russia has initiated the Eurasian Customs Union and the Eurasian Economic Union to oppose the rising economic influence of the European Union and, to a lesser extent, China in the post-Soviet region. Even though Belarus has been a member of both organizations, it has not primarily focused on strengthening trade relations with both institutions’ member states. Instead, the post-Soviet country attempts to pursue a multi-vector foreign trade policy in which it seeks to develop (new) trade relations with countries other than Russia to diminish its trade dependency to its Eastern neighbor. However, since 2010, two of the most prioritized vectors have been the European Union and China. Hence, the objective of this thesis has been to examine the impact of Belarus’s membership in the Eurasian Customs Union and the Eurasian Economic Union on its ability to intensify trade relations with the European Union and China and focuses on the period 2010-2018. In this way, this research attempts to explore the understudied relationship between multilateral economic organizations and small states’ foreign trade policies and to contribute to the limited existing literature on Belarus’s multi-vector foreign trade policy. To answer the research question, qualitative research is done. Data has been collected through a document analysis, a discourse analysis and five qualitative interviews. The main finding of this thesis is that while Belarus’s membership in the ECU and the EEU has impacted its foreign trade policy in a wide range of areas, being part of these institutions has neither weakened nor expanded its ability to intensify trade relations with the EU or China. Moscow has not used its economic preponderance within both organizations to hinder Belarus from developing closer trade relations with China or the EU.","['foreign trade policy', 'small states', ""Belarus's multi-vector foreign policy"", 'Eurasian economic integration']"

Polarisation in Separation A Buddhist View on Affective Polarisation,"Glas, Charlotte","['Li, Jingjing']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to examine the strand of Buddhism called Engaged Buddhism within the context of a Western political science concept called affective polarisation. Formulated in differing societal contexts on different continent, the doctrines expressed in both theories inevitably showcase differences between one another. However, more interesting than the differences that can be found are the similarities, which provide striking and illuminating points of correspondence. Formulating the structure of this thesis by means of the triad of thesis, antithesis, synthesis might clarify the effort that will be undertaken. The first chapter will discuss arguments in support of how affective polarisation can best be ameliorated. Affective polarisation has been addressed as fitting into the theory of social identity. The second chapter will look at how from a Western perspective, similarities can be discerned in Engaged Buddhism with regards to affective polarisation. But more importantly, this chapter will allow for a different Buddhist perspective on how to tackle the problem of affective polarisation. The conclusion will naturally culminate in the synthesis.","['Engaged Buddhism', 'Polarisation', 'Political Science']"

"Romeinen, Germanen en het Nieuwe Westen: Een onderzoek naar 'migratie' en 'invasie' in Romeins-Gallië in de Late Keizertijd","Montfrooij, Max","['Flohr, Miko']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Sinds de publicatie van 'The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' door Edward Gibbon, is de val van het Romeinse Rijk in het westen voortdurend in direct verband gebracht met de komst van Germaanse stammen van over de grenzen langs de Donau en Rijn (limes). Met name in de vijfde eeuw, toen de druk op de grenzen ertoe leidde dat het Romeinse gezag in het westen ernstig verzwakte. De rol van Germanen in deze vermeende val van een grootmacht, is in de afgelopen decennia echter sterk geproblematiseerd. Recent onderzoek ziet in de activiteit van Germanen eerder patronen van migratie, dan doelgerichte invasie, waardoor de rol van Germanen in de val van het Romeinse westen wordt betwijfeld. In het huidige historische onderzoek is hierdoor een discussie ontstaan rondom de kwestie van Germanen en de val van Romeinse macht in het westen. Dit onderzoek legt daarom drie periodes van invasie/migratie uit de Late Keizertijd naast elkaar, om zo in een vergelijkend onderzoek uit de primaire bronnen de verschillen en continuïteit in de verplaatsing van Germanen langs de grens te onderzoeken. Hierbij is het veel beschreven Gallië als focus genomen. De bevindingen tonen dat de groepen Germanen niet zomaar als migranten of invasiemacht de grens overtrokken, maar in een complex proces zich zowel de macht toe-eigenden als dat zij macht in de provincies via Romeinse machtsstructuren toebedeeld kregen.","['Romeinen', 'Germanen', 'Romanisering', 'Barbarisering', 'Rijngrens', 'limes', 'late keizertijd', 'migratie', 'invasie', 'acculturatie', 'barbaren', 'auxilia', 'Gallië', 'Romeins-Gallië']"

Assembling (in)security.

The indirect way of engaging in conflict is, according to policy makers, today’s panacea to ‘achieve a more sustainable victory’ while ‘it won’t require us sending a new generation (...) overseas to fight and die for another decade on foreign soil’. The unfortunate reality is, however, that little is known about the sustainability of this military strategy. Available studies on SFA predominantly assess the effectiveness on the battlefield, but there is surprisingly little academic research – let alone public debate – on its long-term effects and the kind of security it creates. As a first attempt to rectify this relative inattention in the literature, this study investigates the Mosul Offensive to understand how and with what effect the U.S.-led Global Coalition against Daesh tried to govern security outcomes in Iraq through the SFA programs that were central to Operation Inherent Resolve between 2014 and 2018.","['Security Force Assistance (SFA)', 'Proxy Warfare', 'Counterterrorism', 'ISIL in Mosul']"
FvD: Populist Hard Eurosceptic?,"Heijloo, Naomi","['Oster, J.S.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Over the last several years, a shift toward Eurosceptic populism has been apparent in the Dutch political landscape. The rise of Eurosceptic populism and the subsequent erosion of traditional centrist parties have been described as one of the most prominent changes of the last decade. One party that is relatively new to the Dutch political landscape is Forum for Democracy (FvD). This party soon has been characterised as hard Eurosceptic, anti-EU, and populist by political opponents and mass media. Although far-right political parties are often labeled Eurosceptic and populist, Euroscepticism is not a phenomenon with a single explanation. Political parties differ in their critical attitude toward the EU, and distinctions can be made between categories of populist right-wing parties. This thesis, therefore, examines the Eurosceptic and populist nature of FvD. In addition, it analyses what factors contribute to the success of far-right Dutch political parties, such as FvD. Qualitative research has been used to examine the degree of Euroscepticism, the populist nature and the factors contributing to the success of populist Eurosceptic parties. The FvD party is used as a case study in this paper. This research project is based on party manifestos, speeches and debates. The results show that FvD can be classified as a hard rejectionist Eurosceptic party and as populist radical right-wing. The success of far-right populist political parties can be explained on the basis of different aspects, such as anti-immigration sentiments, political distrust among voters, increased volatility, and charismatic leadership. Each aspect can be found in the manifestos and other related texts of FvD. Hence, these aspects can be considered one of the main reasons explaining the rise of far-right parties such as FvD. However, it should be noted that the factors based on voter motivations have largely been excluded. An additional focus on the factor of voter motives could have drawn a bigger picture and provided a better explanation for the recent rise of far-right political parties. Therefore, it is recommended that more research shall be conducted.","['Euroscepticism', 'populism', 'PRR conditions']"
"Richard Brothers, The Profane Fellow Much Talked Of: Popularity, Prophecy and Millenarianism in the Age of Reason","Verloop, Leon Franciscus","['Laborie, Lionel']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Richard Brothers was a notable early believer and advocate for English-Israelism. He antagonized the government with prophecies of the king of England yielding his throne to him. Prophesying that the hidden Jews of England would return to Israel under his guidance. He was the most prominent late 18thcentury prophet and remains a controversial and misunderstood figure. Despite decade long interest from scholars, Brothers’ role as part of the broader radical culture remains a matter of debate. While his story can be interpreted as that of a lunatic who stumbled into fame, we will discuss what allowed Brothers to blossom into a national phenomenon. The aim is to explore Brothers’ role and impact in the context of the larger radical movement. We will explore why Brothers was prosecuted in a government effort aimed at silencing these radical groups in England, and why his political and religious message were deemed too dangerous to be left unchecked. We will view Brothers through the lens that most of Britain would have seen him through in 1795, the newspapers. A deeply divisive figure, he sparked discourse in all layers of English society. His fame reached even outside Britain. While the exact number of followers and sympathetic individuals has been the subject of some debate, the aim is to find out if there was significant support for the prophet. With material documenting Brothers’ impact on London now readily available in online newspaper archives, the goal of this research is to answer the question: What impact did Richard Brothers have on society and how was he perceived by the government and the public?","['Prophecy', 'Millenarianism', 'Enlightenment', 'radicalism', 'England', '18th Century']"
Why Do Conflicts in the Post-Soviet Space Freeze? Evidence from Moldova and Georgia,"Tavenier, Ruben","['Cusumano, Eugenio']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The aim of this thesis is to establish a better understanding of the inner workings of frozen conflicts, by addressing the question of how the conflicts in Moldova and Georgia in the early 90’s became frozen. The current comprehension of frozen conflicts, both in academia and policy-making circles is rather elusive, as the conflicts are often seen through a mono-theoretical lens, overlooking the potential interaction between different factors on different levels. The three main theoretical perspectives on frozen conflicts; the geopolitical, ethno-nationalist and political-economic perspective, are assessed, after which an explanatory variable is derived from each one. Subsequently, the cases of Moldova and Georgia are analyzed alongside these variables, to determine to what extent each mechanism plays a role in the development of frozen conflicts. A qualitative comparative analysis is carried out to assess the interrelation between variables, across the three different phases of a frozen conflict. The results of this research show that the frozen conflicts in Moldova and Georgia are neither solely ethnic nor geopolitical in nature. Ethnic tensions interplayed with geopolitical motives, which are substantiated by criminal economic incentives. Therefore, the multi-layered nature of frozen conflicts cannot fully be understood through a monotheoretical lens.","['Frozen Conflicts', 'Russia', 'Geopolitics', 'Ethno-politics', 'Political Economy', 'Theoretical Synthesis', 'Moldova', 'Georgia']"

Their agency became important to Dutch and Republican powerbrokers during the Dutch-Indonesian war of 1945-1949. Historians, like George McT. Kahin, argue that these federal Indonesians were either Dutch puppets or political 'opportunists' and part of a Dutch divide and rule strategy to regain their former colony. The author of the thesis refutes such arguments. By analysing the BFO's agency during the conflict, it becomes apparent that they were not merely puppets or opportunists, but that their decisions to either coöperate with the Dutch or the Republic were largely based on the way the war developed. This meaning the violence used during the conflict, the exercission of control of powerbrokers over Indonesian territory and the expectations this created about who would remain in power in Indonesia in the future. It will be emphasized that their cooperation with either the Dutch or the Republic was mostly involuntary and depended on which powerbroker could keep them save from violent harm and could safeguard a future for them in the future indepedent Indonesian state.","['Indonesia', 'Late colonialism', 'Dutch-Indonesian War', ""Federal Consultative Assembly / 'Bijeenkomst Federaal Overleg' (BFO)"", 'Federalism', 'Colonial violence', 'Colonial collaboration']"
Hunting with Death: The Hittite King and the Šalliš Wastaiš Ritual,"Gianniris, Konstantinos","['Waal, Willemijn']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The death of the Hittite king was an event of cosmogonic proportions for Hittite society. The political, religious and social vacuum created by this event signaled the beginning of a an elaborate fourteen-day-long funerary ritual known among scholars as the “Šalliš Wastaiš ritual”. Its main purpose was the orderly transition of the king’s soul to the underworld. At the same time, the usage of various ritual objects aimed, among others, at presenting the deceased as an otherworldly hunter. Of these objects, the bow, the arrow, the quiver, the spear and the hunting bag were closely connected with Hittite royal hunting, something which is also visible in the textual and iconographic sources of the wider ancient Near East. The construction of a post-mortem image of the deceased king as a hunter was based on the apparent close relation of hunting with religion, warfare and Hittite royal ideology. Considering that Hittite textual and iconographic evidence show that success in the hunt was directly proportional to the offerings toward the gods, the presentation of the ruler as an accomplished hunter propagated his privileged relationship with the divine, and indicated that hunting was treated as a ritual act of great importance. At the same time, given the importance of warfare for the Hittite state, and the equation of the hunt with war, the inclusion of hunting objects in the royal funeral demonstrated that according to Hittite royal ideology the successful hunter was also a mighty and undefeated warrior. Moreover, the hunt acquired a political dimension too, because it sustained the royal propaganda. The killing of big game by the king was indicative of strength and courage, and symbolized his superhuman abilities. Hunting had important cosmological implications as well, since its mastery by the king illustrated his physical and spiritual dominion over the wild beasts which represented one of the aggressive aspects of nature. By showing his command of the animal world, the king emerged, in life and in death, as the defender of civilization against the menace of nature.","['Hittite king', 'Šalliš Wastaiš ritual', 'Hunting', 'Royal ideology']"

"How Does It End?: Joyce's ""Ithaca"" and the Interrogative Mood in Contemporary Mexican Literary Non-Fiction","Mullee, Mark Stephen","['Timmer, Nanne']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Valeria Luiselli, in her book-length essay, Los niños perdidos, uses an immigration questionnaire to structure her story of the refugee crisis taking place across the US-Mexico border. In Examen de mi padre, Jorge Volpi uses the schema of his father’s body to structure his “autopsy”—not only of his father but also of the Mexican nation in the depth of an existential crisis. This thesis studies these two pieces of literary non-fiction through the lens of teaching and the interrogative mood in the “Ithaca” episode of James Joyce’s Ulysses. In “Ithaca,” a question and answer structure subverts the Roman Catholic catechism and its drive toward a single truth, as well as the scientific objectivism which the questions and answers themselves mimic stylistically. To what extent does the question and answer structure subvert the scientific and political discourse in Volpi’s essay in 10 lessons and Luiselli’s essay in 40 questions? I borrow from the methodology of secondary language teaching to explore and order the different types of questions and their linguistic relevance to literary style. How do Joyce’s experiences as a language teacher, using the interrogative mood as a teaching method, influence his literary use of interrogatives? The grammatical progression of the interrogative mood serves as an organizing principle for my own research questions. I argue that Luiselli’s use of the interrogative mood, like Joyce’s in “Ithaca” and Volpi’s in Examen de mi padre evades the determinacy and conclusion of an ending as well as any purely objectivist approach to its subject.","['Joyce', 'Volpi', 'Luiselli', 'Interrogative', 'Pedagogy', 'US-Mexico Border', '""Ithaca""']"

Culture-Specific Items in Translation: Comparing Translation Strategies in Gender-Specific Children's Literature,"Berg, Lente van den","['Dorst, A.G.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis is located in the field of Children’s Literature Translation Studies (CLTS). A large research gap in this field is the translation of gender-specific children’s books. This thesis, therefore, aspires to reveal a possible gender bias in the way these books are translated by comparing their translations of Culture-Specific Items (CSI’s). For the analysis, two popular gender-specific children’s book series were chosen which have been translated from English into Dutch: the Dork Diaries series, written by Rachel Renée Russell, and the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, written by Jeff Kinney. Using Aixelá’s classification of translation procedures, the translation strategy used for each culture-specific item (domestication or foreignization) was determined. Subsequently, a comparative analysis revealed that CSI’s in in the boys’ books series were domesticated much more often than those in the girls’ book series (a difference of 22%), which suggests that a gender bias is indeed present in the way CSI’s are translated in boys’ and girls’ books.",

The study finds a negative and significant correlation between nonviolent conflict cessation and both democratisation and authoritarian consolidation. Disaggregating the data by regime type reveals that democracies and machine-type autocracies are less susceptible to this effect than either military and personalist regimes. Finally, further inspection of the data reveals that both regime type and a number of other variables act as proxies for regimes’ internal stability and the absence of intra-elite rivalry. The finding, consistent with much of the existing literature, is that intra-elite rivalry drives regimes and leaders to continue fighting, and diminishes the probability of negotiated settlement.","['Regime type', 'Authoritarian regime', 'Conflict termination', 'Democratisation', 'Authoritarian consolidation', 'Insurgency', 'Domestic conflict']"

Framing Crisis: Geopolitics of Contemporary Mass Media Representation,"Lasauskaite, E.","['Shobeiri, Ali']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Contemporary mass media is continuously presenting overwhelming amounts of information along with outstanding headlines and powerful images, targeting media users daily for their attention. Since visual content requires less time and effort to grasp the basis of an event, photographic images, given their general notion of being truthful, play a crucial part in representation of the events and thus are the key element in constructing news narratives. What is more, aftermath photographs, often used in news reports, are vital in creating common memory and helping to understand the issue while landscape photographs illustrate the scale of the disaster and present political or institutional powers of the place. However, a closer look at the mass media news reports shows that geopolitics may be another critical yet overlooked component in constructing mass media news stories with potentially unfavorable effects on news credibility. Visual analysis of two recent events presented by this research, namely Amazon rainforest fires and Siberian wild forest fires, illustrates how selection of photographs regarding the place of the event might be dependent on geopolitical aspects, in turn making some of the events more visible than others despite their equal significance on a global scale. Hence, this thesis discusses the role of geopolitics in visual representation of the events and questions in what ways do they contribute to the framing of the news on mass media platforms along with possible consequences of their perception and evaluation by the public.","['Geopolitics', 'Visual representation', 'Mass media']"
'Op een listige wijze van weegen de klageresse gepersuadeert...' Tweevoudige normatieve ordes bij huwelijkszaken in de Scholarchale Vergadering te Galle vanuit lokaal perspectief,"Aarts, Eline Nicole","['Schrikker, Alicia']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek stond de volgende vraag centraal: Hoe was de interactie van de lokale bevolking van Sri Lanka met de Nederlandse koloniale instituties en rechtsnormen op het gebied van huwelijkszaken in 1763 en 1764? In het eerste hoofdstuk was de Sri Lankaanse historische context beschreven aan de hand van secundaire literatuur. Door haar komst op Sri Lanka had de VOC het handelsmonopolie op kaneel overgenomen van de Portugezen. Onder de VOC reikte het kolonialisme verder dan alleen de handel; de Nederlanders oefenden door lokale instituties overheidsmacht uit. De Scholarchale Vergadering, die toezicht hield op het werk van de schoolmeesters en fungeerde als een civiele rechtbank, was zo’n institutie. De tweeledige rol van deze schoolmeesters – het verzorgen van het onderwijs en het bijhouden van de schoolthombo’s – maakten hen de ogen en oren van de VOC op het zuidwestelijke platteland. Zo kon de VOC tot op lokaal niveau invloed uitoefenen bij de Sri Lankaanse bevolking. Het tweede hoofdstuk richtte zich op het al bestaande lokale gewoonterecht rond het thema huwelijk en de interactie van de koloniale rechtsnormen en -orde met de lokale praktijk op dit punt. Er werd in secundaire literatuur gevonden dat de lokale bevolking zich vaak vasthield aan eigen huwelijksgewoonten; zij kenden het verband niet tussen een legale status en een huwelijk of een kind. Koloniale instellingen werden vaak verward met het eigen gewoonterecht en zo werden deze koloniale instellingen, zoals de vereiste twee stappen tot een legaal huwelijk, halfslachtig nageleefd. Sancties op het overtreden van de koloniale verordeningen werden vaak niet gehandhaafd en de Nederlanders sloten hun ogen voor lokale praktijken. De voorkeur van de VOC ging uit naar economische winst boven moralistische integriteit. In het derde hoofdstuk zijn de notulen van de Scholarchale Vergadering in Galle van de jaren 1763 en 1764 doorgespit. Het inside-out perspectief is hierbij in acht genomen: wat bewoog de lokale bevolking om huwelijkszaken aan een koloniale rechtsinstitutie, waar andere rechtsnormen golden, voor te leggen? De acht huwelijkszaken gevonden in deze twee jaar wijzen erop dat binnen de huwelijkspraktijk van de lokale bevolking het lokale gewoonterecht nog sterk de overhand behield ten opzichte van de koloniale rechtsnormen. Zodra er echter een persoonlijk voordeel te halen viel via koloniale juridische instituties wist de lokale bevolking deze te vinden – zo ook de Scholarchale Vergadering. Degenen die voor de Scholarchale Vergadering verschenen met een verzoek leken de koloniale rechtsnormen niet te verwarren met het eigen gewoonterecht: er bestond een bewustzijn van de juridische voordelen die hun verzoek met zich meebracht. Deze bevinding wijkt af van de secundaire literatuur. Pas als deze voordelen van toepassing waren werd er echter meegebogen in de koloniale rechtsnormen. De aanklagers hadden vaak voldoende – en in een enkel geval ontoereikende – kennis van de koloniale rechtsorde om te weten dat zij via de Scholarchale Vergadering voor hun eigen belang konden opkomen en hoe zij dit konden doen aan de hand van koloniale wetten en instellingen. Rupesinghe vond in haar studie van de Landraden dat de lokale bevolking deze koloniale instituties wist te consulteren uit eigenbelang. De bevindingen in dit onderzoek zijn in overeenstemming daarmee. Door naar de koloniale bureaucratie te gaan met onderlinge geschillen legitimeerde de lokale bevolking de macht van de VOC op het eiland, zoals Alicia Schrikker stelde.","['Scholarchale Vergadering', 'Sri Lanka', 'VOC', 'Huwelijk', 'Rechtspluralisme', 'Kolonialisme', 'Ceylon', 'Gereformeerde Kerk', 'Gewoonterecht', 'Rechtspraak']"

Naar eigen zeggen was er op de vier continenten waar zij ervaring hadden met het curriculum weinig constructief gebruik gemaakt van wat het disciplinaire archief van de antropologie te bieden had. Er werd te veel aandacht besteed aan de teleologische opsomming van ismes, wat samen met het ‘Oedipuscomplex van de post-reflexieve periode’ de basis vormt voor een antropologische relatie met het verleden die berust op het aanwijzen van imperfecties. In deze scriptie wordt een vruchtbaarder geachte relatie met het verleden behandeld. Herman Paul stelt dat het verleden gebruikt kan worden om het 'repertoire aan morele ervaringen' te vergroten waarop men zich baseert bij het maken van keuzes. Gedurende de ontwikkeling van het vakgebied in de koloniale periode en de Koude Oorlog liepen antropologen tegen vergelijkbare ethische problemen aan als antropologen die zich in het heden bezig houden met 'military anthropology'.

De rol van authenticiteit in de lokale journalistiek,"Amerongen, Femke van","['Koetsenruijter, Willem']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek richt zich op authenticiteit. Consumenten steeds vaker op zoek naar authentieke producten en ervaringen (Gilmore & Pine, 2007; 2013; Boyle, 2004). Zo ook in de journalistiek (Costera Meijer, 2010; Harte, Howells & Williams, 2019). Volgens verschillende onderzoeken, waaronder Koetsenruijter & De Jong (2019), Sie (2017) en Harte, Howells & Williams (2019) is authenticiteit een sleutelwoord waarmee lokale nieuwsmedia zich kunnen onderscheiden van regionale en landelijke media. Ook Nielsen (2015) onderschrijft dit belang van authenticiteit. Hij stelt dat lokale media een authentieke vorm van nieuws bieden die bij regionale en landelijke media niet te verkrijgen is. De lokale journalistiek zit in een moeilijke periode. Bezuinigingen, wegvallende redacties en teruglopende inkomsten zorgen ervoor dat lokale media moeite hebben het hoofd boven water te houden. Lokale media slinken (Kik, Bakker, Buijs, & Katz, 2012), terwijl het belang van de journalistiek en haar controlerende rol alleen maar groter is geworden (Koetsenruijter & van der Lubben, 2018). Authenticiteit kan als strategie worden ingezet om de lokale journalistiek te helpen in tijden dat deze sector het lastig heeft (Harte, Howells & Williams, 2019; De Jong & Koetsenruijter, 2019). Door zich bewust te zijn van de elementen van authenticiteit in de lokale journalistiek en hierop in te spelen, kan authenticiteit als unique selling point dienen en het vakgebied helpen zich verder te ontwikkelen en te versterken. Er is nog weinig onderzoek gedaan naar hoe authenticiteit gestalte kan krijgen in de lokale journalistiek. Dit onderzoek richt zich daarom op de vraag welke vormen van authenticiteit door communicatieprofessionals en journalisten worden aangewezen in de lokale journalistiek. Volgens Trilling (1972, p.149) kan je authenticiteit als een ‘construct’ beschouwen. Hoewel de perceptie van authenticiteit per persoon kan verschillen, zijn er kenmerken die een voorspeller kunnen zijn voor authenticiteit. In dit onderzoek staan er drie vormen van authenticiteit centraal: nabijheid, oprechtheid en betrokkenheid. Deze vormen zijn gekozen op basis van zowel bestaande literatuur als uit eerste bestudering van het onderzoeksmateriaal. Naast de theorie van authenticiteit staan er nog twee theorieën centraal in dit onderzoek, namelijk de theorie van de functies van de journalistiek en de theorie over boundary work: de discussie over wat goede journalistiek is. Omdat authenticiteit in de lokale journalistiek een grotere rol speelt dan bij regionale of landelijke media, kan de invulling van de journalistieke functies namelijk veranderen. Tevens kan ook de focus op de functies veranderen. Ditzelfde geldt voor het boundary work. De rol van authenticiteit zorgt er in de lokale media ook voor dat de discussie over wat het vak journalistiek inhoudt, kan veranderen. De drie theorieën staan dus met elkaar in verbinding. Deze drie theorieën worden onderzocht door het discours over authenticiteit in de lokale journalistiek in beeld te brengen en op deze manier vormen van authenticiteit aan te kunnen wijzen. Hiervoor zijn er 47 interviews met zowel journalisten als communicatieprofessionals uit de provincie Zuid-Holland geanalyseerd. In het discours over authenticiteit in de lokale journalistiek wordt vaak over drie vormen van authenticiteit gepraat, namelijk nabijheid, oprechtheid en betrokkenheid. Per vorm van authenticiteit zijn meerdere sublabels uit de interviews gedestilleerd. Zo spelen bij nabijheid de nabijheid van een nieuwsgebeurtenis zelf, de journalist en het medium een belangrijke rol. Oprechtheid omvat sublabels die betrekking hebben op het ethos van de journalist of het medium, de persoonlijkheid en de menselijkheid. Betrokkenheid is ingevuld door sublabels die concretiseren hoe lezers meer betrokken raken met de lokale journalistiek. De authenticiteit die volgens de geïnterviewden van toepassing is in de lokale journalistiek, heeft effect op de functies van journalistiek en haar boundary work. Op het gebied van de journalistieke functies is er een verschuiving van de focus te zien. Waar landelijke media zich voornamelijk bezighouden met het vervullen van de controlerende functie, zoals bronnen checken en hoor en wederhoor plegen, is dit in de lokale journalistiek een minder voorkomende praktijk. In de lokale journalistiek ligt de nadruk veel meer op de sociaal bindende functie. Het lokale journalistieke werk is er meer op gericht om de sociale cohesie binnen een gemeenschap te versterken. Lokale media zorgen voor herkenbare verhalen door te schrijven met én over mensen. Maar ook door onderdeel te zijn van de lokale sfeer, zich daadwerkelijk te mengen in de gemeenschap. Ze staan dicht bij de mensen, dichterbij dan regionale of landelijke media staan. De informerende functie is voor de lokale journalistiek ook erg belangrijk. Lokale media zijn dé informatieverstrekkers van lokaal nieuws. Wanneer deze media wegvallen, zal dit vooral in kleinere gemeentes duidelijk te voelen zijn. Het is dus een functie die door lokale media zich goed vervuld moet worden. Mensen hebben nu eenmaal behoefte aan lokaal nieuws. Lokale media moeten hierin de beste (kunnen) zijn, aangezien zij ín de gemeenschap zitten en van de hoed en de rand weten. Authenticiteit in de lokale journalistiek zorgt er ook voor dat journalisten en communicatieprofessionals het beroep journalistiek anders invullen dan regionale en landelijke media. In het boundary work van de lokale journalistiek is er minder focus op de professionaliteit van deelnemers en de journalistieke praktijken en is er meer oog voor authentieke kenmerken. Waar regionale en landelijke journalistiek hun vakgebied voornamelijk inkaderen op het gebied van principes zoals hoor en wederhoor, doet de lokale journalistiek dit dus anders. Dit betekent dat de lokale journalistiek zich (nog meer) kan profileren op basis van authenticiteit. Juist omdat lokale media hierin anders opereren dan de regionale en landelijke journalistiek. Lokale media kunnen authenticiteit inzetten als unique selling point om zo een onderscheidend vermogen te creëren. Hoewel je ook vormen van authenticiteit ziet terugkomen in landelijke media, is authenticiteit wel iets dat bij regionale en landelijke media in mindere mate te verkrijgen is. Authenticiteit is voor lokale journalistiek het sleutelwoord om hun positie in het medialandschap te behouden en versterken.","['Authenticiteit', 'Nabijheid', 'Oprechtheid', 'Betrokkenheid', 'Functies van de journalistiek', 'Boundary Work', 'Lokale journalistiek']"

Trying to mend this bias by exclusively exploring women’s perspectives, using mainly qualitative, in-depth interviews, I was able to identify the centrality of motherhood and mothering to the gendered standpoint of Zanzibari women, also in connection to their attitudes towards ‘the political’. Consequently, this thesis explores the roles the institution of motherhood and mothering as practice play in women’s navigation of (political) uncertainty and conflict in the islands. To establish the context in which this navigation takes place and to mend misconceptions about female (non-)participation in Zanzibari electoral politics, the active roles women have filled in the island’s political history are highlighted. To be able to understand the ‘maternal standpoint’, my respondents spoke and navigated from, local ideologies and experiences of motherhood and mothering are explored. The Swahili terms uchungu (bitterness) and kuhangaika (‘to roam about and struggle’) are central here, expressing the sacrifice that is often expected and performed by mothers. I develop the concept of ‘maternal navigation’ which takes into account the practices of actors who not only strategize to ‘get by’ and ‘get on’ as individuals but navigate uncertainty on behalf of and through others. This helps to make sense of my respondents’ practices as they consider risks and vulnerabilities while negotiating prevalent social, cultural, economic and political circumstances, for the sake of bringing about the best possible results for their children and families. In the political context, motherhood and mothering are shown to have a variety of sometimes contradictory influences, e.g. in connection to the promotion or dismissal of political peace-building. Mothers are also shown to develop specific maternal strategies in face of the risks of politics in the islands to safeguard themselves, but – most importantly – their families and children against political dangers and exposure. Overall, the complex and ambivalence force motherhood and maternal subjectivities represent in the political sphere and in relation to the navigational activities of Zanzibari women is highlighted.","['Gender', 'Zanzibar', 'Political conflict', 'Motherhood', 'Uncertainty', 'Navigation', 'Mothering']"

'Maîtres de l'Art Indépendant': Nationalisation of Modernism in France in 1937,"Tomas, Borchert","['Storm, Eric']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"By the late nineteenth century, art history was immersed in the construction of national identities in Europe. Museums and exhibitions were vital players in communicating these identities at home and abroad. Art historians increasingly appropriated painters and sculptors for their own countries as artists and their creations added significantly to a country’s prestige and increased cultural influence on the world stage – known in France as rayonnement culturel. Michela Passini’s magisterial La Fabrique de l’Art National (2013) focussed no longer only on politics and art but on the interaction of politics and art historiography instead. Since then there is a growing interest in the impact of nationalistic politics on the formal and institutional evolution of French art history from the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth century. The historiographical research of Passini and other scholars reflects the fact that art historians at that time were predominantly interested in art of the Renaissance and the Middle Ages. The understanding of the process of what could be called ‘nationalisation of modernist art’ in France, however, has not yet benefitted thoroughly from this shift towards art historiography. Traditionally, the period has either been analysed from the perspective of another Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes or seen through the lens of xenophobic sentiment towards Jewish and foreign modernist in the aftermath of the Dreyfus-Affair. This thesis focuses on ‘Maîtres de l’Art Indépendant’, an encyclopaedic exhibition organized at Paris’ Petit Palais to coincide with the world fair of 1937. It was the first officially endorsed retrospective of French modernism and included Cubism and Fauvism which had previously been conspicuously absent from most museums in the capital. My study aims to demonstrate that the decision to promote French modernism in 1937 was steeped in very similar nationalist priorities as those held by a previous generation of art historians investigated by Passini and others.","['Nationalisation', 'Modernism', 'France', 'Interwar']"
Er zwemt een zeehond in de Oudegracht - Verificatie van foto- en videomateriaal op redacties van lokale en regionale nieuwsmedia in Nederland,"Brink, Elyse van den","['Burger, Peter']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Bij veel nieuwsitems is beeld haast niet meer weg te denken. En door de opkomst van sociale media maken journalisten steeds vaker gebruik van foto- of videomateriaal dat zij op websites zoals Facebook en Twitter vinden (Brandtzaeg, 2016). Tegelijkertijd duikt de term ‘nepnieuws’ overal op. De manier waarop journalisten de authenticiteit van beeld controleren, is dus van belang. Dit onderzoek is toegespitst op het verificatieproces van journalisten op lokale en regionale nieuwsredacties in Nederland. De volgende onderzoeksvraag staat hierbij centraal: hoe controleren Nederlandse journalisten van lokale en regionale nieuwsmedia de authenticiteit van foto- en videomateriaal? Semigestructureerde interviews en een praktische opdracht bieden inzicht in deze vraag. De wijze waarop journalisten beeldmateriaal verifiëren, is afhankelijk van verschillende factoren. Allereerst geven de respondenten aan dat niet alles te controleren is, maar dat zij het wel belangrijk vinden om na te gaan of het beeld dat zij willen gebruiken rechtenvrij is. Beeldmateriaal wordt soms niet geverifieerd wanneer de journalist een bepaalde bron genoeg vertrouwt. Daarnaast worden archiefbeelden en stockfoto’s gebruikt wanneer de authenticiteit van het beeldmateriaal niet direct vast te stellen is, maar het nieuwsfeit wel snel gemeld moet worden. Ook dekken journalisten zich in door te melden dat er beelden zijn opgedoken van een bepaalde gebeurtenis, waarbij ze in het midden laten of de beelden wel kloppen. Daarnaast vertrouwen ze bij het verificatieproces op hun ervaring en de kennis van de regio waarin ze werken. Tools worden nog niet regelmatig ingezet om beelden te verifiëren. Wel gebruikt een aantal respondenten een reverse image search bijvoorbeeld om na te gaan of een beeld rechtenvrij is, iets dat voor een groot aantal respondenten zwaar meeweegt in het verificatieproces. Dit geldt dan vooral voor de kleinere lokale media. Zij maken ook vaak gebruik van user-generated content (UGC) dat door lezers zelf aangeleverd wordt voor de website en de krant. Beelden bij deze vorm van UGC worden niet altijd even grondig gecontroleerd, omdat dit ook vaak luchtigere onderwerpen zijn.","['Verificatie', 'Authenticiteit', 'Verificatietools', 'Beeld', 'Factchecken', 'Regionale journalistiek', 'Lokale journalistiek']"
Straattaal and Change over the Years,"Vorswijk, Regina F.","['Kossmann, M.G.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis studies the lexical items in youth language, henceforth Straattaal, currently used by Dutch youths in the city of Almere, in order to identify possible developments in Straattaal lexicon 20 years after Appel’s (1999) first analysis of Straattaal words, which was conducted in Amsterdam. The investigation is directed at finding out to what extent the lexicon of Straattaal has changed, and what this change may possibly tell us about the dynamics of language. Previous research that has been done on Straattaal has for the most part focused on the perceptions and attitudes towards Straattaal and its social significance. The scope of this thesis is focused on testing students’ knowledge of Straattaal, and comparing the Straattaal words currently used by youngsters aged between 16 and 30 who live in Almere to those collected and analyzed in the studies performed some twenty years ago by Appel (1999), Appel & Schoonen (2005), and Nortier (2001). The aim of this investigation was to find out whether Straattaal is indeed, as Nortier (2001) notes, subject to continuous change. In order to gather data for this study, an online survey was conducted among 150 students, between the ages of 16 and 30, of an intermediate vocational school in the city of Almere. The survey consisted of a list of 50 words, identified as Straattaal words compiled for earlier studies. The survey first addressed the issue of the contemporaneity of Apple’s list of most commonly used Straattaal words from 1999, including the list that was compiled in Appel & Schoonen’s 2005 study and the list compiled by Nortier in 2001. Participants were asked if they could identify the words in the list as being Straattaal words, if they knew their meaning, and if they used the words themselves. The data showed that Straattaal is quite prevalent. 58% of respondents claimed to use Straattaal regularly. With regard to the extent to which Straattaal has evolved over the past 20 years, no considerable changes were found.","['straattaal', 'lexicon', 'change', 'dynamics']"

United States policies shaped Puerto Rico’s political and economic landscape with severe consequences for life on the island. This particularly became clear in August 2017 when first Hurricane Irma, but especially Hurricane Maria devastated the island. The current study investigates the role that imperialist policies have played in the federal relief aid after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico. A content analysis of news items, official documents, and Donald Trump’s Twitter messages indicate that imperialist policies – expressed through preferential treatment between states and Puerto Rico, economic constraints and bureaucratic hurdles, and the behavior and language use of the president – indeed inhibited an effective recovery mission on the island. It underscores that imperialism still guides the diplomatic relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico.","['United States', 'Puerto Rico', 'Hurricane Maria', 'Relief Aid', 'Imperialism']"

Re-thinking Religiousness in Kierkegaard's Postscript. On the Secular Relevance of the Category of Religiousness,"Sanctorum, Timo","['Berger, Douglas']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I take up Kierkegaard’s religious theory and, more specifically, his notion of religiousness. I argue that this notion, along with his overall system, carries significant value for non-religious individuals. In Kierkegaardian scholarship, there are two series of interpreters. Firstly, there are those who treat his work in a strictly religious fashion and who judge its concepts strictly for their content. Secondly, there are those scholars who pursue less strict theological readings and argue for the revival of its broader existential relevance. It is to this school of thought this thesis wishes to contribute. In the first chapter, I aim to show that Kierkegaard’s understanding of religiousness can hardly be grasped if we do not highlight his commitments to subjectivity. Religiousness, in the Climacus writings, is in the first place a highly subjective affair. In the second chapter, I continue by exploring the category of religiousness to see where – despite building upon – it differs from mere subjectivity. In this way, the first two chapters are more descriptive than argumentative. In a final chapter, I consider the works of Michael O’neill Burns and Andrew Torrance, who both pertain to the series of scholars who treat Kierkegaardian philosophy in a strict religious fashion. I counter both of their claims in order to substantiate my own reading of Kierkegaardian thought, stressing its secular validity. For this, I draw upon the work of Merold Westphal and Mariana Alessandri, as well as my own reading of the Postscript, to argue that Kierkegaard’s system, despite having deeply theological grounds, offers an extraordinary foundation for all human beings to build their life-attitude on.","['subjectivity', 'religiousness', 'religiosity', 'secularism', 'inwardness']"
The Pocket Politician: A Constructivist Perspective on Gijs van Oenen's Concept of Algorithmic Representation,"Hemmen, Mike","['Sleutels, Jan']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This work critically assesses the idea of replacing political representation based on elections and politicians by big data-driven algorithms. The rapid digitalization and datafication of our world is fuelling the debate on democratic theory. Can the potential of new ICTs be harnessed to work for the benefit of democracy? Using Gijs van Oenen’s account as base, I make the idea of algorithmic representation more concrete by introducing the concept of a Pocket Politician, and by exploring three scenarios of what this could look like. To further unpack this concept I apply two conceptual tools of the ‘constructivist turn’ in democratic theory: Fossen’s logical distinction between dyadic-triadic and Saward’s theory on the representative claim. By doing so, I show that such a new ‘algorithmic’ system of representation would go accompanied with the loss of human intentionality and the loss of visibility. (1) Algorithmic representation blurs the characterization of the citizens that are represented. It is no longer clear as what citizens are represented due to the non-human intentionality of algorithms. And (2) the performance of representation – the representative claims – will not be visible to the citizens, making it a non-transparent form of politics. Combined, these two concessions would restrict citizens’ ability to see and experience politics on both a sensory and mental level. I come back to the three scenarios of a Pocket Politician to discuss whether this is a problem. I argue that applying algorithmic representation could be beneficial for a democracy depending on its particular state and particular needs.","['political representation', 'democratic theory', 'algorithms', 'constructivism', 'performative representation']"

Indonesia: Debates on Islam and feminism since 2014,"Vaart, Aisya van der","['Henley, David']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,South and Southeast Asian Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In recent years Indonesia faced some challenges with regards to feminism and Islam. Islam and feminism are two terms which are assumed to be incompatible according to the Muslim community. Before the start of the Jokowi-era in 2014 the Indonesian feminist movement was gradually taking place and Indonesian Islam was modestly acquainted with feminism. This progressive spirit reached its peak with the implementation by the government of the 30% gender quota in 2004 with which women obtained more political involvement. This showed that the government aimed at empowering women and strived for more gender equality. Until recently a mildly progressive development with respect to women’s participation is still taking place. Several other organizations and institutions support the pro-feminist movement. Yet, as it is, the feminist progressive spirit has also known a certain backlash since 2014. In this thesis my research will show how the relation between Islam and feminism in Indonesia has changed during the last 5 years and consequently what challenges the Indonesian religious feminist movement is facing. I will focus on the recent events, struggles and the coinciding ongoing debates. Firstly, I will focus on the by government implemented gender quota system and its pitfalls. Secondly, I will briefly discuss the various organizations and institutions that contribute to Indonesian feminist movement and are linked to the recent KUPI-congress which provides us information about the specific Indonesian ‘religious’ feminist movement. Thirdly, I will cover the debate about the Elimination of the Sexual Violence Bill which gives us insights in what the pro-feminist spirit and the anti-feminist wave have to contend with. Finally, I will discuss the Islamic sources and the contextual interpretation of the scriptures that dictate how Indonesian women should dress in the public sphere and act in in the political arena. These different aspects of my research will answer the question: “How has the relation between Islam and feminism changed since the start of the Jokowi-era in 2014?”  ","['Islam', 'Feminism.

Ibu Kota Baru for a New Indonesia. An Analysis of the Project of the New Indonesian Capital through Government Tweets,"Frigo, Giulia","['Henley, David']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"On the 17th of April 2019, Indonesia held the general elections. The President Joko Widodo (“Jokowi”) won 55,5% of the vote, beating the former general Prabowo Subianto representing Gerindra Party for the second time, the first in 2014. Less than two weeks after the victory, the re-elected President announced its intention to relocate the nation's capital from Jakarta, located in Java island, to a greenfield site on the island of Kalimantan. In this thesis, I use Twitter communication emanating from the Indonesian Ministry of National Development Planning and the office of the President to dissect the official rationale for this historic initiative and to investigate on the political and ideological discourse surrounding it. What is the Indonesian government trying to achieve through this project? What ideals and political priorities does it reflect? Is there consistency in the official discourse? My analysis is both quantitative and qualitative; it is quantitative because I used large numbers of tweets to measure the frequency which a variety of terms is used to describe both the desirable characteristics of the new capital, and the undesirable aspects of the old one. It is partly qualitative because I investigated and critically reflected on the results found on Twitter to understand better the motifs behind the decision of moving the capital, and be able to answer my research questions. The results show that Jakarta has been abandoned because it does not represent the Indonesian aspirations of modernity, reflected on the smart, sustainable and green imaginaries that the new capital will promote. Indeed, the tweet analysis revealed that these three elements are the most desirable features for the new capital of Indonesia and are the emblem of the type of modernity and progress that the Indonesian government is aspiring to. This is confirmed by the fact that the mentions to smart, green and sustainable are not clear nor justified. These terms appear to be used as buzzwords, almost as if it they were interchangeable. In conclusion, I argue that these features are all instrumental for expressing modernity and progress (Maju). This is the real objective of the government. “The city of dreams”, as I renamed it, imagines a flawless and perfect city, symbol of the progress of the whole country; the truth is that it is only a symbol, and the country will not progress in smartness, greenness, sustainability and equality if not through real policies and measures that tackle the local problems. Besides these attributes, the government claimed that the new capital would bring to more regional equality and economic growth. In this regard, the Indonesian government has also tweeted about Brasilia and its similarities with the new Indonesian capital, praising the design and the outcome of the project; like Brasilia, the new capital is seen as a means to cope with ongoing economic imbalance among the different regions of Indonesia. Although regional equality is, of course, an issue that the government needs to tackle, the increase of GDP outside Java will not benefit the whole population unless there is a real will to tackle inequality not only geographically but also across income groups. Besides, it is essential to remember that the gap between the rich and the poor in Jakarta is substantial and moving the capital will not represent a solution to this problem. Furthermore, the comparison with Brasilia was fundamental to notice a crucial vii paradox in the project of Ibu Kota Baru: by promoting a modern and futuristic capital, Ibu Kota Baru implicitly indicates a refusal of existing conditions of Indonesia, just as like Brasilia did. To conclude, it is important to mention that this thesis is about ideology. In essence, it does not seek to analyse the hidden personal interests and oligarchic business strategies on the project of the capital, although this has been briefly pointed out. The ultimate aim is to dissect the official rhetoric and rationale that surround this project to find the political ideals and desirable features that the project reflects, and inconsistencies in the discourse.","['Indonesia', 'Political Communication', 'Capital', 'Twitter', 'Smart city', 'Sustainability', 'Green', 'Jakarta', 'Inequalities', 'Modernism']"

Employing a feminist IR theoretical framework and an engaged, qualitative methodology of semi-structured interviews, I investigate the migration experiences of undocumented Latina factory workers, as an interplay between their gender, their undocumented immigration status, and their work. The findings allow us to examine self-narrativized realities where the politicization of the personal is paramount. Gaby, Valentina, and Margarita, the collaborators, share their personal experience with undocumented migration, motherhood, tiring work schedules and hard labor, all while navigating gendered oppressions. I find that even the most common private matters and experiences are imbibed with power dynamics and tensions, and that they are present at all stages of international politics. The research concludes that using the personal experience in order to make (feminist) sense of International Relations is a necessity.","['Gender', 'Feminism', 'Migration', 'Undocumented', 'Personal story', 'International Relations', 'Engaged research', 'Latina']"

Erik Prince and the Private Security Sector in the United States: A Seemingly Unlikely Return,"Winkel, Dennis","['Duyvesteyn, Isabelle']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis looked at Erik Prince and his fall from grace in the United States and his return several years later. The research question of this thesis is: How can the seemingly paradoxical resurfacing of Erik Prince under the Trump administration be explained in relation to the position of the Private Security Sector in the United States? Initially when looking at the matter, it appears there is a paradox surrounding the resurfacing of Erik Prince. However, when examining the matter more closely it appears the paradox is, in fact, not present at all. This is due to the continuity of the development of the private security sector after Prince had left the United States. Although the public and politics openly turned away from private security, behind the scenes the business thrived. This can be seen at the factual use of private security by the United States in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan after Prince fell from grace. Since Prince remained active in his business ventures and private security, even though he suggested otherwise, a return was waiting to happen. With a more favourable administration with Donald Trump as its president, a full return is not as unusual as initially thought. The like-minded president and the many connections Prince had in, or near, the White House provided plenty of opportunity to return to the United States. This thesis provides a background of the revival of the private security sector after the Cold War followed by a chapter on the life, business, benefits and the role of Erik Prince both inside and outside the USA. Thirdly, the development of the private security sector is analysed. This chapter focusses on the regulatory developments as well as the development of the sector under the two presidencies since the Nisour Square Massacre in 2007. This massacre is generally accepted as the event that initiated the fall of Erik Prince. Finally, the thesis looks at the question whether Prince was ever really gone from the United States and relates this back to the research question.","['Erik Prince', 'Private Security', 'Nisour', 'PMSC', 'Blackwater', 'Private Security Sector', 'Private Contractor']"

An integrated system of CO2 reduction policies for Environmental Liberals,"Roosenstein, lars","['Verbeek, Bruno']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"Extreme weather events, natural disasters and failure in mitigating or adapting to the changing climate. All these societal risks have become more likely and impactful over the last couple of decades. It is important to limit the excessive human emission of greenhouse gases such as CO2, because they contribute to the changing climate. In order to gain support for CO2 reduction policies, environmental concerns must be reconciled with the prevailing political ideology. The focus is on liberal democracy because it is the dominant political system in western society. One of the difficulties in combining environmental concerns with liberal democracy is that policies to protect nature put limits on what people are allowed to do and thereby limit the individual liberty of citizens. In this thesis I investigate witch CO2 policies fit best with Liberal-democratic positions about the environment. I will answer the following questions: Why does the market fail to ensure an efficient amount of CO2 emissions? Which kind of CO2 reduction policies are most suitable to reduce excessive emissions? How can CO2 policies be combined with liberal democratic values? Which policy is preferable based on liberal democratic positions about the environment? The two most discussed market-based CO2 policies are excise tax and emission trading. This thesis argues for an integrated approach, formed by both policies. This system is preferable because it internalizes externalities to reduce excessive emissions, and simultaneously enforces a maximum amount of emissions to prevent an environmental crisis.","['CO2', 'Liberalism', 'Green liberalism', 'Marcel Wissenburg', 'Emission trade', 'Environmentalism', 'Excise tax', 'Externality']"

This thesis analysed the extent to which this fictional dichotomy reflects and comments on the ideological divide between scientists and humanities scholars in Western society. The analysis focused on the trilogy’s first novel, Oryx and Crake (2003). Oryx and Crake depicts the relationship between humanities scholars and natural scientists on a societal level, but also through the friendship between its main characters Jimmy and Crake. This thesis compares Jimmy and Crake to the stereotypical images of humanities scholars and natural scientists. It argues that the novel challenges the stereotypes of the superfluous humanities scholar and the mad scientist, by showing that the characters who represent these stereotypes are much more complex. This thesis demonstrates that these stereotypes impede open conversations between the two cultures in the novel. It concludes that reading Oryx and Crake gives the reader a better understanding of the reasons behind the conflict between the two cultures. By doing so, the novel provides a starting point to improve the mutual understanding between the humanities and the natural sciences.","['Margaret Atwood', 'Two Cultures', 'C.P.

China en India zijn opkomende economieën en Nederlandse bedrijven proberen de vruchten van deze uitbreidende markten mee te plukken.

The analysis focuses on the seventeenth-century East Indonesia as this period was considered crucial for the Company’s objectives in reinforcing their power and influence in the spice-producing region. To achieve the objectives, the Company needed more than just a military excellence because at the time they also dealt with strong opponent such as Makassar. As a result, the Company designed a strategy to overcome the challenge in which Buton, together with Ternate and Bone, became a part of it although the VOC’s sources identified Buton as not profitable. To answer the research question, this thesis investigated the Butonese materials and the VOC’s materials those were found in the Netherlands. The effort to bring together these sources is an attempt to understand the Butonese and the Company’s perspectives and to see whether their perspectives aligned or distinct with one another. Regarding this issue, this study shows that the Butonese materials and the VOC materials were never in harmony. As the Butonese considered the Company as their “dear friends” throughout the seventeenth century, the Company did not seem to share the same idea.","['Buton', 'the Dutch East India Company', 'the VOC', 'sources']"

Cultural Mobilisation by the Greek Far Right: The Case of Cavafy and the Golden Dawn,"Douliakas, Georgios Evgenios","['Boletsi, Maria']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis deals with the issue of cultural appropriation by the Greek far-right party Golden Dawn. Under which conditions does Golden Dawn (GD) manage to implement cultural personas and objects in its narrative, what enables it to do so, and what is the result of this practice? Can a cultural object mobilised for political purposes speak back and what does that entail for the object’s political force? Furthermore, how can culture and one’s way of looking at it function as a catalyst for the formation of bonds amongst men? Focusing on C.P. Cavafy’s mobilisation by GD, and using concepts and insights by Bal, van Alphen, Derrida, and Puar as its theoretical background, this thesis will probe into these questions. Approaching GD’s website as a museum where cultural objects are placed and viewers are invited to gaze upon them, as well as by examining performances of homophobia by GD, I argue that there is a strong aspect of theatricality in these practices. This theatricality shapes an audience, which, whether accepting or condemning what it sees, essentially serves to further foster male bonds within Golden Dawn.","['Cultural Appropriation', 'Neo-nazi', 'Golden Dawn', 'C.P.

The poet and the spectator: Arendt’s conceptualization of publicness and judgment in context,"Gallego Herrera, Gabriel","['Fossen, Thomas']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"Hannah Arendt did more than write philosophy and publishes books; she rescued conceptions of the public and recovered the problem of thinking and judging in politics as a manner to make sense of a world that shattered the political tradition. The current thesis will present a reading of Arendt’s political judgment and publicness by taking some elements of the Cambridge Intellectual History approach. The goal of using this approach is not a way of declaring itself as the true interpretation, but a manner of relating Arendt’s work to a proper understanding of her words and actions as part of a context for the enunciation. By using this method we are proposing a perspective of Arendt late work as a crucial shift in her notion of freedom and its relation with politics. This shift starts with some undeveloped intuitions from her early work, mostly The Origins of Totalitarianism and The human Condition, to her essays such as Between Past and Future and Responsibility and Judgment, to finish in her later works such as On Revolution, Crises of the Republic, The Life of the Mind, and her Lectures on the Political Philosophy of Kant. We can notice a shift from narration to judgment in Arendt’s theory. By relating to this topics we propose a reading of publicness as a central element of Arendt’s work that appeals to the space of appearances that is opened in judgment and action, and at the same time a certain urge for courage required for politics; for leaving the comfort of the private space and take responsibility to appear with others and be judged and remembered in public. This notion of publicness changed or is complemented by a different one in her later work where we find instead a shift towards the attitude of the spectator and the disinterestedness of judgment. Disinterestedness is an aesthetical attitude that Arendt recovers from Kant’s discussion on his Third Critique and refers to a certain distance regarding interest and necessity. This notion is expressed in her appropriation of Kant’s idea of reflective judgment and her reflections on taste related to Kant’s concern with sensus communis and her own concept of common sense. In these elements we see judgment in the attitude of the spectator along with a certain taste and preoccupation for the human-made artifacts and the grounding for a space of appearances.

Segment-tone integration in word identification by Dutch-Vietnamese heritage speakers,"Ebenau, Jerom","['Chen, Yiya']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Much of the literature on heritage language phonology finds heritage speakers to show some influence from their dominant language compared to homeland speakers, but heritage speakers still perform more accurately in their heritage language than do naïve speakers. Yet, research on heritage language phonology is limited compared to that on heritage language syntax and morphology. This is even more so the case for research on heritage speakers’ suprasegmental phonology: for instance, very little is known about heritage speakers’ perception of lexical tone. The present study used an ABX task to investigate perceptual segment-tone integration in heritage speakers of Vietnamese in the Netherlands, compared to monolingually raised Dutch and Vietnamese speakers in the homeland, respectively. Heritage speakers were found to have a stronger segment-tone integration than the monolingually raised Dutch, whereas the homeland Vietnamese showed a slightly stronger integration than the heritage speakers. Moreover, the groups’ integrations were asymmetrical: heritage speakers considered both tones and segments in word identification but had a clear preference for segments; the Dutch controls almost exclusively considered segments and the Vietnamese controls had a slight preference for tone-based word identification. The findings thus conform to previous literature on heritage language phonology: the heritage speakers performed intermediately between monolinguals of their heritage and dominant languages.","['heritage language', 'Southern Vietnamese', 'Vietnamese', 'Dutch', 'segment-tone integration', 'word processing', 'lexical tone', 'phonology']"

“Interpreting scalar implicatures and their sensitivity to face in Greek.”,"Papanikolaou, Stefania","['Terkourafi, Marina']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, we present an experiment designed to examine the interpretation of scalar implicatures in Greek. Scalar implicatures appear to examples like “I ate some of the pasta.” This sentence implies that the speaker uses the term “some” because s/he had reasons not to use the stronger word “all” in the sentence, e.g. “I didn’t eat all of the pasta.” Recent studies of experimental pragmatics suggest that the inference “I ate some (but not all) of the pasta” would not exist in face-saving acts (Bonnefon, J.-F., Feeney, A. & G. Villejoubert (2009). By contrast, Terkourafi and Weissman claim that face-boosting contexts favor lower-bound interpretations. We conducted an experiment addressing this issue, by testing a group of 40 adults (all native speakers of Greek) on four different scalar terms, , , , . Overall, our results indicate that Boost story Version favors lower bound interpretation and are consistent with Terkourafi and Weissman’s conclusions and opposite to Bonnefon’s and colleagues’ hypothesis","['Experimental pragmatics', 'scalar implicatures', 'politeness', 'Greek']"

Motivating Future-Oriented Action. Self-regarding reasons to ensure the fate of future generations,"Westerink, Juliette","['Meijers, Tim']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"With the challenges of global warming and the loss of biodiversity worsening, scientists are calling for unprecedented, multi-level societal change in the next several decades, especially in affluent societies. Such change is required in order to abate the worst possible consequences of societal collapse and human extinction in the coming centuries. If such change is ever to happen, a comprehensive understanding of why people would be willing to bear the costs of change in order to ensure the fate of future generations is required. Many philosophers have provided moral arguments to answer this question. In this thesis I examine the work of Samuel Scheffler who addresses this issue from a different angle, questioning whether and in what ways future generations matter to us. Scheffler argues that compelling reasons for wanting to ensure that humanity continues to thrive in the remote future are implicit in many of the things that matter to people today. I discuss various challenges to Scheffler’s work and argue that, besides minor amendments, his core claims are viable. Indeed, the survival and flourishing of humanity into the remote future matter to us in its own right and because it is a condition for our ability to live a value-laden life. Moreover, it enables us to answer our conservative desire to preserve and sustain the things that we value beyond our own lifespan. Consequently, I stress the importance of incorporating these reasons into communication strategies aimed at enhancing public support for environmental policies, as these reasons have strong motivational power.","['future generations', 'Samuel Scheffler', 'sustainability', 'values', 'motivation', 'value-based communication strategy']"
A Critical Assessment of The FAIR Guiding Principles in Book History,"Crane, Chelsea","['Verhaar, P.A.F.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"We examine in detail the FAIR Guiding Principles, what they are, why they were created, as well as highlight the difference between Linked Open Data and FAIR. We then give an overview of the current environment of humanities scholarship, paying particular attention to the Digital Humanities and book history. We explore some of the reasons that the implementation of FAIR is significantly slower in the Humanities compared to the Sciences or Social Sciences by highlighting some of the challenges faced by humanities scholars in terms of producing and quantifying digital research data that is also easily findable and reusable, while taking time to discuss issues found in all disciplines such as IP, copyright, and privacy laws, as well as issues concerning authenticity, authority, trust, verification, and uncertainty relevant to open-source platforms and digital assets. A case study is then presented using a database that was created using information from the original book catalogue and cashbooks from the Bibliotheca Thysiana, a seventeenth-century library located in Leiden, The Netherlands. After analyzing the quality of the data from the Thysiana based on the requirements of the FAIR Principles, we then utilize the steps in the FAIRification Process by applying each to the database one at a time, highlighting any challenges along the way. Finally, we conclude with thoughts and criticisms on the feasibility of the application of FAIR onto a humanities database, suggesting that it is indeed a guide that can be implemented practically in the field of book history, yet not without some challenges and forethought.","['Book History', 'FAIR', 'FAIR Guiding Principles', 'Critical Assessment', 'FAIR in Humanities', 'FAIR Data', 'Digital Humanities', 'Humanities Data', 'Book Historical Data', 'Quantitative Humanities Data']"
Marketing Academic Monographs: How is digital marketing used by university presses to improve monograph visibility and promote sales?,"Drew, Lucy","['Van der Weel, Adriaan']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Digital Age, or the Age of Information, has made university presses and their mission to produce top quality scholarship more important than ever before. Knowledge is at everyone’s fingertips, it is as easy as pressing a few buttons on your computer, but this ease is not unilaterally aligned with reliability. This is why university content is becoming increasingly more vital. However, limited budgets, changing markets, and a reluctance to embrace digital technologies have resulted in many university presses struggling to stay in operation. The monograph in particular is struggling to turn profits and is beginning to be viewed by portions of the academic community as outdated and a monetary burden for universities. This thesis looks at how university press monographs can survive in this changing climate, in particular by employing digital marketing strategies. It examines three major developing areas of digital marketing (big data, social media use by the press and social media use by the author). It draws on UP case studies to illustrate digital marketing engagement.","['digital', 'marketing', 'monograph', 'press', 'big data', 'social media', 'universities']"
Cojo Branti: De invloed van de stadsbrand van 1832 op de raciale verhoudingen en stadsslavernij in Paramaribo in de eerste helft van de negentiende eeuw en de postkoloniale verandering in de Surinaamse herdenkingstraditie,"Smits, Jessica","['Fatah-Black, Karwan']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In de eerste helft van de negentiende eeuw veranderde het stadslandschap van Paramaribo op rigoureuze wijze doordat twee branden (1821 en 1832) relatief kort na elkaar het stadscentrum bijna volledig wegvaagden. Met name de stadsbrand van 1821 liet een verwoest stadshart achter. De herbouw duurde jaren maar was vergevorderd toen de tweede brand in 1832 weer een groot deel van het centrum van de stad in de as legde. Nu Paramaribo voor de tweede keer in korte tijd door een verwoestende brand was getroffen moesten er maatregelen worden genomen om dit in de toekomst te voorkomen. Toen na een paar weken werd ontdekt dat de brand was aangestoken deed het bestuur er alles aan om de schuldigen te pakken. De brandstichters bleken weggelopen slaafgemaakten te zijn. De combinatie van angst voor weggelopen slaafgemaakten en angst voor brand zorgde ervoor dat de daders zwaar werden gestraft. Koloniale slavensamenlevingen werden beheerst door angst, van de slaafgemaakten voor het geweld van de eigenaren, en van de eigenaren voor opstand door de slaafgemaakten. Dit leidde volgens historicus Vincent Brown niet alleen tot een vicieuze cirkel van angst en geweld, maar ook tot specifieke vormen van anti-zwart racisme tegen mannen in slavensamenlevingen. Volgens Brown werkt dit door in hedendaagse raciale vooroordelen. Suriname past in dat beeld; de koloniale machthebbers waren bang voor de slaafgemaakten op de plantages en de marrons. Maar in de stad waande men zich lange tijd veilig. De brand bracht daar mogelijk grote verandering in, en daarmee mogelijk ook in de verhouding tussen eigenaren en slaven in de stad. In dit onderzoek zal de invloed van de brand van 1832 op de stadsslavernij in Paramaribo nader worden bekeken. En ook hoe de betekenis van de stadsbrand, die de geschiedenis in zou gaan als de ‘Cojo branti’, door de jaren heen veranderde. Die verandering is een goede graadmeter voor de postkoloniale verwerking van deze geschiedenis. Het toont de veranderende plek die het slavernijverleden in de Surinaamse nationale identiteit heeft gekregen, maar of de veranderende herdenkingstraditie ook afbreuk heeft gedaan aan anti-zwart racisme is een open vraag.","['Stadsslavernij', 'urban slavery', 'Paramaribo', 'Suriname', 'slavernij', 'herdenking']"

Mobiliteit in de media,"Wiering, Josse","['Hout, Tom Van']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Mobiliteitswetenschappers zijn het erover eens dat mensen op een fundamenteel andere wijze over de betekenis van mobiliteit moeten gaan denken om de opwarming van de aarde tegen te gaan. De manier waarop de mens zichzelf en zijn goederen in de huidige samenleving vervoert, is immers van grote invloed op het klimaatprobleem. Aangezien de media bijdragen aan de betekenis die mensen aan de wereld geven, zouden zij een interessante ingang kunnen zijn voor het doel dat de mobiliteitswetenschap wil bereiken. In dit paper is daarom onderzocht of en hoe de Nederlandse en Vlaamse media bijdragen aan het veranderen van de manier waarop over mobiliteit wordt gedacht. Om hier een beeld van te krijgen, is gekeken naar de discoursen over het fileprobleem in de Vlaamse en Nederlandse kwaliteitskranten. Hiervoor is gebruik gemaakt van de Systematc Metaphor Analysis (SMA), waarmee conceptuele metaforen uit krantenartikelen over het fileprobleem zijn geïdentificeerd en gekeken is naar de discursieve patronen die uit deze metaforen spreken. Dit onderzoek onderscheidde één metonymie en zes conceptuele metaforen: ‘de file is een probleem van heel Vlaanderen/Nederland’, ‘de file is een object’, ‘de file is een ziekte’, ‘de file is de vijand’, ‘de file is een natuurlijk proces/product’, ‘de file is een meetbaar systeem’ en ‘de file is helend’. Uit de analyse van deze conceptuele metaforen kwam naar voren dat de Vlaamse en Nederlandse kwaliteitskranten weinig tot geen verandering brengen in de huidige, heersende mobiliteitsdiscoursen. De kranten vormen zo een deel van het probleem: ze bevestigen de heersende mobiliteitsdiscoursen, waar volgens mobiliteitswetenschappers juist verandering in moet komen. Dit paper betoogt daarom dat een verandering in de manier waarop over mobiliteit wordt geschreven in de media een middel kan zijn voor de mobiliteitswetenschap om haar beoogde doel te bereiken.","['media', 'file', 'metaforen', 'kranten', 'discours', 'fileprobleem', 'mobiliteit', 'klimaatprobleem']"
"""Nio far, ça veut dire on est ensemble"" African Identity through a Popular Culture lens: a journey into football, fashion and music from Morocco to Senegal","Derfoufi, Oumaima","['Abbink, Jan']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to explore African identity through a popular culture lens. It uses a comparative approach between Morocco and Senegal and focuses on three main components of popular culture: football, music and fashion. This research examines how the latter may or not promote a shared African identity between Morocco and Senegal. This thesis is based on an ethnographic study in Ifrane, Rabat and Essaouira in Morocco and Dakar in Senegal. It relies heavily on qualitative data resulting from seven month’s fieldwork in both countries. The research explores African identity through the stories of the people directly concerned, Africans. In the first instance, and as a way of understanding one population segment – the youth – semi-structured interviews were conducted with Moroccan students from Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, which demonstrated the influence of some aspects of popular culture, but also of education in shaping their identities as Africans. In the same measure, interviews were also conducted with Senegalese students from University Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar. Furthermore, this research also relies on interviews with older generations in both Morocco and Senegal, as well as participant observations by attending events related to music, fashion and football. Part of the research also relies on surveys conducted during the African Cup of Nations. This thesis showcases how popular culture promotes a shared African identity between Morocco and Senegal by, first, promoting African unity illustrated by football games, second, by promoting African history, through a music - Gnawa - that has traveled from Sub-Saharan Africa to North Africa to recall their stories, and third, by promoting African roots, highlighted by Moroccan young designers who use fashion as a tool to assert their African identity. Finally, this research aims to contribute to a larger academic debate on the separation of North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, by outlining popular culture as an important factor when studying and comparing the latter. Therefore, on a academic level, it aims to raise awareness with regards to paying more attention to North Africa as part of the African continent - thus part of African studies; and second, on a social level, as a way of promoting African identity and unity through the power of popular culture.","['Identity', 'African identity', 'popular culture', 'football', 'music', 'fashion', 'Morocco', 'Senegal']"

This role of higher education historically has been seen as fostering economic development of nations and the provision of opportunities for individuals to promoting and harmonizing cultural diversity, political democracy, and economic trade. Critics allege higher education institutions worldwide, but especially in Latin America have become or are becoming handmaidens of neoliberal institutions, including neoliberal states and such global institutions as the world bank or the OECD (Rose 2003, 67-68). Is this true? If neoliberalization of higher education is indeed happening, do neoliberal reforms promote more inclusive higher education responsive to labor market needs? By addressing this research question, we can have a better understanding of the dynamics of higher education and their position within society. This might give more insight on a regional level of how these dynamics function, but it could also be an insight into the comparison with other developing regions.","['Neoliberalism', 'social inequality', 'global political economy', 'chile', 'colombia', 'higher education']"

This paper aims to open up broader discussions about cultural institutions and artists’ responsibilities in producing counter-narratives that service refugees’ perspectives and voices. By doing so, museums and relevant artists can avoid perpetuating existing tropes and ensure that their own agendas are secondary to what the subject of their work (in this case, refugee and asylum seekers) wishes to convey. By means of concrete examples of artists and artwork, the author attempts to bring forth a discussion on the ethical considerations for artists involved in collaborative projects with refugees and asylum seekers by questioning and challenging various frameworks and existing modes of representation within contemporary art discourse. The author proposes different modes of representation that service the ‘protagonist’s’ story first, referring to concepts and practices through which to understand the construction of visual narratives surrounding refugees; thus establishing how these practices can be effective beyond simply making things visible.","['artists', 'refugees', 'asylum seekers', 'ethics of representation', 'rehumanization', 'We Are Here/ Wij Zijn Hier']"
Doing Well Through Doing Good: Is The Ethical Investment Movement Truly 'Ethical'?,"Heybrock, Jonathan","['Bagatur, Sine']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"Unsurprisingly given its nomenclature, there exists within the ethical investment industry an implicit assumption that its investment practices and products are - by their very nature - intentionally ethical. This thesis challenges this assumption, refuting the notion that the Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) ‘movements’ are always ethical. I justify this refutation through concluding that actions within these movements may only be deemed as truly 'ethical' if they are: (i) underpinned by ethical motives and (ii) have an ethical impact. I go on to argue that investors and/or companies choosing to engage in these ethical investment movements have, by definition, heightened ethical obligations, which are only satisfied if both aforementioned conditions are met. Throughout the paper, I challenge the ethical validity of these movements by investigating instances where either the motive or the impact can be called into question, ultimately concluding that 'ethical' investment practices are not always as ethical as initially portrayed.","['Ethical Investment Movement', 'Sustainable Finance']"
Het Journalistieke Landschap in de Gemeente Aalten Een Onderzoek Naar Aaltense Print- en Onlinemedia,"Wassink, Muriel","['De Jong, Jaap']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Veel onderzoeken impliceren dat de lokale journalistiek in zwaar weer verkeert. Voornamelijk gemeenten met minder dan 50.000 inwoners hebben met vele uitdagingen te maken die de huidige problemen rondom de lokale journalistiek met zich meebrengen. Met ongeveer 27.000 inwoners valt de gemeente Aalten onder de zogenoemde kleine gemeenten waar de zorgen rondom lokale journalistiek het grootst zijn. Dit onderzoek is in twee delen gepresenteerd. In dit onderzoek ligt de focus op de staat en de toekomst van de print- en online media in de gemeente Aalten. Het aanpalende onderzoek heeft als focus de staat en de toekomst van de radio en televisie in de gemeente. In dit onderzoek is die vraag vertaald in twee deelvragen: 1. Wat is de huidige stand van zaken van het medialandschap in de gemeente Aalten met betrekking tot print en online media? 2. Welke scenario’s zijn er om een eventuele kwaliteitsverbetering te bewerkstelligen? Aan de hand van een literatuurstudie zijn de ontwikkelingen en bedreigingen van de algemene print- en onlinemedia in kaart gebracht op zowel landelijk als lokaal niveau. Daarnaast zijn er scenario’s geschetst van initiatieven op lokaal en nationaal niveau die opgericht zijn op de kwaliteitsverbetering van de lokale journalistiek. De literatuurstudie geeft basis voor de topiclijst die gebruikt is voor de semigestructureerde interviews. Deze zijn afgenomen bij de stakeholders van de Aaltense media, om antwoorden te kunnen geven op de onderzoeksvragen. De gemeente wordt aanbevolen om met andere gemeenten in de regio Achterhoek of uit de provincie Gelderland te spreken over de mogelijkheden voor een journalistiekfonds. De invulling hiervoor kan afgeleid worden uit andere initiatieven die al gaande zijn in het land. Ook wordt de gemeente aanbevolen om de prijs die ze betalen voor het publiceren van de gemeenteadvertenties te verhogen, omdat deze nu verlieslijdend is voor de media. Daarnaast zou de gemeente samenwerking tussen de print- en onlinemedia en de radio- en televisieomroepen kunnen stimuleren aan de hand van bijvoorbeeld beloningen.","['Journalistiek', 'Lokaal', 'Print', 'Online']"

Previous research finds that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are employing a surveillant construction to unite the heterogenous elements of the country using Big Data (BD), including; Chinese individuals, companies, social organizations and government agencies. This thesis focuses on how Foucault’s, Deleuze & Guatarri’s and Jäger’s interpretation of the ‘dispositive’ is being updated onto the digital platform of the SCS. Conducting Siegfried Jäger’s ‘Dispositive Analysis’ over a 3 × 3 analysis framework which includes the three perspectives of Apparatus, Articulation and Assemblage over the three modalities of Law, Ethical and Utilitarian, the thesis presents how the CCP are reconstructing cyberspace for the application of the SCS.

The arguments in this thesis will show how the ambiguous nature of the current legal framework has caused a lack of democratic responsibility in anti-piracy action. This has led to a situation of increased violence and human rights violation as economic incentives have been allowed to precede social incentives. To increase democratic responsibility in PMSC’s, I propose that Dutch policy should focus on the creation of corporate social responsibility within the companies that are allowed to operate on board ships passing through high risk areas. It is important however, to be aware of the internal contradictions that face CSR-theory and focus on the possibility of omitting these obstacles in the unique context in which the Law for the Protection of Dutch Merchant Ships will be implemented.","['Security', 'Law', 'PMSC', 'CSR', 'Anti-Piracy', 'Somalia', 'Neoliberalism', 'G4S', 'Weber', 'Netherlands']"

This thesis explores whether and to what extent the increased attention to inequality observed in the agency’s public presentation has been accompanied by substantive changes in its policies. It does so through an exploration of continuity and change in the IMF’s operations in Argentina. With its recent history of recurrent fiscal crises and turbulent politics, Argentina is a particularly interesting context in which to explore continuity and change in the IMF’s policy and practices. The thesis finds that while the IMF’s increased attention in equality is indeed reflected in its policies, the changes are modest when compared to earlier loan arrangements and that a gap remains between the agency’s rhetorical statements on inequality and the practical implications of its policies. In so doing, the thesis contributes to scholarship on the IMF and the political economy of contemporary Argentina.","['IMF', 'Inequality', 'Argentina', 'Fiscal consolidation', 'Policy change']"

Procreation in Extreme Poverty,"Morris, Patrick","['Meijers, Tim']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the realm of procreative ethics. In this thesis I provide an example of a prospective procreative couple, Ario and Linda, who wish to procreate in dire circumstances of extreme poverty. I claim that the future child they wish to create (Zaine) will be wronged by their deliberate decision to bring about his life. They wrong this child in the sense that; 1.) they do not have the capability to provide the future child with a minimally adequate standard of upbringing; and 2.) they violate this future child’s birthright to a minimally decent life. Procreating into the dire conditions of extreme poverty prevents this child from enjoying this birthright. Therefore, Linda and Ario, in their procreative circumstances, create this child in such a way as to violate his birthright. They wrong the child in their procreative decision to bring about his life. Chapter one of this essay explores the Non-Identity Problem which poses significant justificatory hurdles if one is to claim that a future child can be wronged by being brought into existence. Chapter two builds on a non-consequentialist approach (introduced in chapter one) to wrongdoing wherein I adopt a deontic principle constraining the procreative right of potential procreators. This deontic principle claims that potential procreators have a duty to provide any offspring they create with an adequate standard of upbringing (section 2.0). Moreover, I will adopt and defend the position that a future child has a birthright to a minimally decent life (section 2.1). Furthermore, I provide, and defend, a threshold standard of existence that illustrates when a life should be considered less than minimally decent (section 2.2). Chapter three is utilized to respond to a number of objections in light of the claim I have proposed.",['Procreation poverty']

The Metaphysics of Iris Murdoch: Kantian Platonism as a Guide to Morals,"Halim, Ahlem","['Chouraqui, Frank']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In recent years, the philosophy of Iris Murdoch has seen a rise in attention, both from philosophers who seek to use elements from her philosophy for their ethical theories, and from those more directly interested in understanding her metaphysics. These latter authors have often either criticised or tried to solve the ambiguity of the metaphysical status of the idea of the Good in her writing. I, too, address the problems in her metaphysics: in what sense does Good exist for Murdoch, and is she able to offer a ‘sophisticated’ form of realism? My theses are, first, that Good, for Murdoch, is a transcendental element in consciousness, i.e., a condition of possibility for the experience of the world, and an ideal end point suggested by experience. To answer the second question I will argue that once Good is read as I argue for, and its role in knowing reality is understood, it becomes clear that Murdoch’s view does not fall into subjectivism or any other form of idealism. Important in this account is love, which, attracted by Good, motivates the work needed for a better grasp of the world.","['Kant', 'Iris Murdoch', 'Plato', 'Metaphysics', '20th-century philosophy', 'The Good', 'Love']"

Arabic speakers’ pronunciation and spelling of English /p/ and /v/,"Mahamdi, Malika","['Grijzenhout, Janet']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study aimed to provide a clearer understanding of the phonetic influence a native speaker of Arabic can experience during the acquisition of English as a second language (ESL), specifically for the consonants /p/ and /v/ in spelling and pronunciation. In a small-scale experiment, Arabic speakers of English were asked to translate an Arabic story to English by hand to create an authentic product of their spelling abilities. Afterwards, the same participants read a short story in English, which was recorded with audio equipment to later evaluate their pronunciation through the program PRAAT. Contrary to existing literature, the small-scale experiment conducted for this study found no significant effect for the influence of Arabic on English spelling despite this being hypothesised and proven in previous research. Along with this, no effect was found for the experiment based on the pronunciation of /p/ and /v/. Whereas the results did show that Arabic speakers of English had a Voice Onset Time (VOT) of /p/ that was considerably lower, they did not realise a [b] instead of the target [ph] as hypothesised. Speakers did not significantly devoice their /v/ to an [f], which does not directly coincide with the literature that has hypothesised the influence of native language phonology on the pronunciation of English as a second language. When evaluating the results as a whole, two things are implied: (1) there is a possible focus in ESL learning on spelling and therefore no issues were found, and (2) pronunciation is a difficult aspect of ESL learning due to the unfamiliar articulatory processes involved and Arabic learners experience difficulties when faced with the unfamiliar /p/ and to a lesser degree also /v/. However, they are able to make the distinction between the phoneme pairs. These implications may help ESL learners in the future to focus on problem areas, further improve their skills, while simultaneously providing the research niche of phonology with new material to investigate.","['Linguistics', 'phonology', 'second language acquisition', 'interference', 'Arabic', 'English', 'PRAAT', 'pronunciation', 'spelling']"

An important part of this presence concerned the significant increase in Western religious mission orders within China. In this thesis, these often-overlooked missionaries are put central by examining their interactions with the local Chinese social and political environment. By following the actions and ideas of the Belgium Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, shortly known as the order of Scheut, this research asks new and insightful questions concerning the policies employed by the missionaries and their eventual outcome. By tracing the order’s development in the vicariates of Outer-Mongolia and Gansu, in terms of their approach towards the mission and the subsequently ensuing conflict, it shows how seemingly minor changes in attitude can create two widely different scenario’s and contradicts the perception of missionaries as mere agents of Western expansion. Missionaries, as agents of dialogue, managed to adapt their actions based on the environment they encountered and through their adaption, influenced the manner in which their local environment perceived them in the context of China’s turbulent nineteenth century.","['China', 'Nineteenth Century', 'Mission Enterprise', 'Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary', 'European Mission', ""China's North Western Frontier"", 'Religious expansion in China']"

The Two-Faced World: the West versus Iran A discourse analysis on the representation of Iran in Dutch documentaries from 1960 until 2018,"Breitenstein, Philip","['Warnaar, Maaike']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the last century the Netherlands went through several large changes. After the Second World War, the Netherlands, as many other West-European countries, modernized which included the creation of large industry, the process of destratification, secularization, emancipation of women, democratization of politics and the emancipation of minority groups like homosexuals. Supposedly, Iran went through an opposite and backward development. From the glory years of the Shah, when modernization of Iran was top priority, the country rapidly declined, in the eyes of the Dutch, into the realm of a backward religious society which the Netherlands tried to espouse for a long time. The knowledge Dutch people have about Iran is not based on individuals visiting Iran but on how the media portrays Iran and reports on Middle Eastern affairs. However, is this dichotomy between Iran, as an Eastern country, and the Netherlands, as a Western country, so clear? When looking into contemporary documentaries Iran is still portrayed as different country than the Netherlands. Portraying is focused on the religious repression, backward economy, bearded men and veiled women. When comparing the footage of contemporary documentaries with documentaries from the start of this genre in 1960, the same type of footage is shown. Has Iran not changed since then? This type of footage seems to fall under the greater themes of Orientalism and the Western narrative of modernity and have been present in the Western conception of the Middle East for very long. This research focusses on the discourses of Orientalism and the Western narrative of modernity in Iranian representation in Dutch documentaries from 1960 until 2018 and the continuity and discontinuity in this representation. This research contributes to the understanding of the development of Orientalism and the Western narrative of modernity in the 20th and 21st century.","['Iran', 'discourse', 'Documentaries', 'Orientalism', 'Modernity', 'Netherlands', 'Dutch', 'representation', '1960-2018']"

Er is geïllustreerd hoe het koloniaal bestuur worstelde met misbruik van het bestuur en rechtspraak door de koloniale elite. Het bestuur probeerde toch vervreemding van diezelfde elite te voorkomen. Het gedeeld belang van het bestuur en de elite, de beheersing van de zwarte en gekleurde meerderheid, was belangrijker. Gekleurde en zwarte ingezetenen werden alleen voor de rechtbank gedaagd als een witte ingezetene benadeeld werd door een overtreding door een zwarte of gekleurde. Zij werden vervolgd vanwege culturele bijeenkomsten, marronage, geweld tegen witten, geweld tussen zwarte en gekleurde inwoners en diefstal. In dit onderzoek zijn deze overtredingen geïllustreerd met rechtszaken, maar is ook besproken hoe de koloniale overheid deze overtredingen trachtte te beheersen. Voorts is aangetoond dat er naast de jurisdictie van de overheid en meesters, ook een Afrikaans-Creeolse juridische traditie moet hebben bestaan op Curaçao.","['criminele rechtspraak', 'social control', 'Curaçao 18e eeuw', 'slavernij']"

The impact of Plan Merida on the development of Drug Cartels between 2006 and 2016,"Mirzasadeghi, Sarvnaz","['Valdivia Rivera, Soledad']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Latin America’s drug trafficking has been a number one priority for the United States (US) and Latin American countries. War on drugs has begun in 1980s and up to now has no end date. The US has united with Colombia for Plan Colombia (1999) to battle the drug trafficking, and then consolidated with Mexico to implement Merida Initiative to battle the Drug Trafficking organizations (narco-cartels). The US administration believed if it implemented Plan Colombia into the Merida Initiative, it would yield the same successful outcomes. It is debatable whether Plan Colombia was successful or not, since the fragmentation of cartels within Colombia has made them untraceable, and raw material cultivation has been moved to other countries such as Mexico, Peru, and Bolivia. It is important to note that drug trafficking organizations depending on country, size and structure. Therefore, it is impossible for anti-drug enforcements to implemented initiatives without alterations in different settings and be expected to reach the same goals. Organized crime and drug trafficking organizations in Mexico have become considerably malicious, which was the reason for the conference between President Calderon of Mexico and US administration in 2006 for the implementation of Merida Initiative, aimed at putting an end to trafficking and organized crime. The war on drugs was militarized through the training of Mexican soldiers in the US and funded by the US and other countries. The effects of such anti-drug law enforcement plans were disappointing, to say the least, as it did not go as planned. This has led to increasing violence, fragmentation of drug cartels and unprecedented levels of police corruption. Therefore, this thesis examines the efficiency of Plan Colombia, as well as alternative explanations to its failure. These include economic and cultural causes leading to stability of drug supply from Mexico to match the rising demand of drugs in the US.",

Instead of measuring „integration‟ in terms of cultural differences between migrants and the native population, this study uses a comparative approach to understand the political behaviour of Turkish migrants. A comparison is made between, firstly, the refugees and expellees who settled in the FRG after World War II and, secondly, internal migrants in Turkey. Although the migration period as well as settlement conditions for the refugees and expellees, and the Turkish workers were different, the similar situation of these groups in the West German labour market enables a comparison between them. The comparison between internal and external migrants of Turkey also enables the evolution of the MHP to be better understood. Moreover, this study uses Turkish workers‟ relationship with the MHP as a lens to understand their political behaviour. In addition, the paper investigates the changes in government policy in both Turkey and the FRG, and the impact of these policies on the Turkish population. This work uses as its primary sources issues from a Turkish diasporic journal published in 1979 by Turk Federation, an organization affiliated with the MHP, and government reports produced by the Turkish authorities from 1966-78.","['The Nationalist Action Party (MHP)', 'Turkish Labour Migration', 'The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)']"

A Red Carpet for China: a closer look at Greek agency in Sino-Greek relations,"Warawdekar, Madhav","['Broad, Matthew']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis departs from dominant approaches to outward Chinese FDI, which tend to focus primarily on China's aggressive expansionism and its grand strategy with regards to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). After identifying gaps in these prevailing approaches, there appeared to be a need for investigating the agency of host countries. The methodology used here was derived from earlier research conducted on China's long-standing engagements in Africa. The arguments made in this thesis reveal more locally-driven elements of Greece's relations with China and highlight the consequential role of Greek agency in these relations. At various scales and levels, Greek actors have used their respective capacities to facilitate, mediate and even resist Chinese presence and investments in Greece, while also carving out opportunities for their own personal or commercial progress. What is apparent here, is that China is not necessarily imposing on Greece with hegemonic intent, as is generally perceived, but is being ushered in by Greeks themselves as an indispensable benefactor of the Greek economy. An important implication for further research is that host countries of Chinese FDI must not be looked at as passive actors in their relations with China, but rather, as agents acting in self-interest. Moreover, the case of Greece can be considered an indication to the EU to reconsider its policies vis-à-vis post-recession recovery in weaker member states.","['Greece', 'Port of Piraeus', 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'Maritime Silk Road', 'Chinese investments', 'influence']"

Le traduzioni di Caproni e Raboni, ambedue poeti italiani famosi, sono apparse molto interessanti per la nostra ricerca per la lunga consuetudine che i loro autori hanno avuto con la poesia di Baudelaire, e per il fatto che sono state rivedute in seguito. L’olandese Verstegen e il belga Claes sono traduttori famosi nell’area olandofona, per cui li abbiamo coinvolti nella nostra ricerca. I traduttori hanno effettuato scelte molto differenti, il che è risultato in traduzioni diversissime. Le traduzioni in prosa di Caproni trasmettono l’esatto contenuto delle poesie originali, ma il lettore non ha nessun’idea della forma, del metro e della rima adoperati da Baudelaire. Manca un aspetto fondamentale dell’originale, per cui la sua magia non viene trasmessa. Le traduzioni di Raboni, attraverso il tempo completamente riscritte, tengono il mezzo fra poesia e prosa e si distanziano chiaramente troppo dalle poesie originali. La forma delle traduzioni di Verstegen e Claes, invece, rispecchia fedelmente quella dei testi francesi. Conseguenza ne è, che sul piano del contenuto si sono dovuti permettere una certa libertà. Le traduzioni dei due traduttori olandesi, che senza dubbio riescono a comunicare al lettore la magia delle poesie originali francesi, sono chiaramente superiori a quelle dei due poeti italiani.","['Charles Baudelaire', 'Les Fleurs du Mal', 'I Fiori del Male', 'Traduzione', 'Poesie', 'Giorgio Caproni', 'Giovanni Raboni', 'Peter Verstegen', 'Paul Claes']"

The results of the reforms were mixed but successful in comparison with earlier attempts. To find a possible explanation for some of the negative outcomes this thesis asks the following research question; To what extent does the dysfunctional, kleptocratic and corrupt system provide the explanation for the shortcomings of the Russian reforms of its military in 2008? The research question will be answered from a socio-cultural angle, and can perhaps provide an explanation for the dysfunctionality, kleptocratic and corrupt system that negatively affected the 2008 reforms. Based on the analysis in this thesis, it can be concluded the Russian military is plagued by a variety of problems that are socio-cultural in nature.

Crisis in the Humanitarian Aid Industry? The politicization of humanitarianism and the contested principle of neutrality in emergency food aid delivery in Syria between 2011 and 2019,"Beekmans, Anne","['Duyvesteyn, Isabelle']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"One of the main impediments to the Syrian conflict, has been the absence of sufficient food aid to the local population. For the past nine years, the Syrian government has systematically blocked humanitarian aid from entering its territory, based on the principle of sovereignty. Theoretically, international aid organizations have impartial access to deliver humanitarian aid when necessary, based on the fundamental humanitarian principles. Paradoxically, these fundamental principles have limited aid organizations to execute their work and compromises needed to be made with the Assad government in order to obtain access. Ever since the beginning of the conflict, humanitarian aid has been unequally distributed via government channels between government- and opposition controlled areas in Syria. It has become a strategy of warfare for the Assad regime, perpetuating violence and advancing legitimization and support for the nation’s regime. Simultaneously, international aid organizations created cross-border operations in order to circumvent this demonstration of the politicization of humanitarianism. This thesis extensively addresses this phenomenon and its consequences, by examining the central research question: To what extent has the politicization of humanitarianism impeded neutral emergency food aid delivery by international aid organizations in the Syrian conflict between 2011 and 2019?","['Emergency Food Aid', 'Syria', 'Neutrality', 'Assad', 'Sovereignty', 'Humanitarian Aid']"

Het neoliberalisme begon als bestrijding van het links-collectivistische gedachtegoed, maar vanaf het einde van de jaren tachtig stopte de Partij van de Arbeid, die altijd de belangrijkste vertegenwoordiger van het links-collectivistische gedachtegoed in Nederland was geweest, met terugvechten; en omarmde zij juist het neoliberalisme.

The Nobel Prize Came Too Soon - On the Colombian referendum about the 2016 peace agreement between the government and the FARC,"Verkaik, Anna","['Sheppard, Randal']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2016 the whole world watched, as three elections around the world produced results that virtually no one had expected. In June that year the Brits voted to leave the European Union. In November the American population voted Donald Trump as their 45th president and on the second of October 2016 the Colombian public voted NO to peace. The unexpectedness of the Colombian outcome is illustrated by the Nobel Peace Prize that was awarded to Santos a mere 5 days after the disappointing result of the peace referendum. Current research is not yet conclusive as to what produced the unexpected result of the Colombian peace referendum. The strong division between Uribe and Santos politicised the referendum and polarised Colombian society. As an effect, the campaigns became highly emotional and ever-present in Colombian society in the months leading up to the referendum. To provide insight into the question as to how the NO camp could convince the Colombian public to vote against peace in the peace referendum and analyse the effectiveness of both strategies, I will analyse the following research question: what were the strategies used by supporters and opponents of the 2016 peace referendum to contest the legitimacy of the peace agreement between Colombia and the FARC? This research will not only provide an insight in the Colombian context but can be applied and adapted to provide insight into other peace referendums as well.",['FARC peace referendum']

Facing The Middle-Income Trap: How Chile Overcame It?,"Bernal Cereceda, Jaime","['Silva, Patricio']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Scholars widely agree on what mostly drives fast economic growth from the low-income (LI) level to the middle-income (MI) one. However, when it comes to jumping from the MI level to the high-income (HI) one, things become far more complex, as severe growth slowdowns become more frequent. This phenomenon, namely: the ‘middle-income trap’ (MIT), refers to the inherent challenges MI countries face in order to reach the HI status. The MIT is present in many comparative studies and policy models as empirical evidence suggests there are shared difficulties present at this level of income, and although it is still an ambiguous and undefined concept, its potential usefulness to guide policy-making is unmistakable, since the idea of a trap can be understood as universally applicable for developing economies struggling to achieve sustainable growth. Three bodies of MIT literature and their respective prescribed set of policies are categorized and analyzed in this study to determine which one can best attributed to the unique and successful case of Chile.","['Chile', 'comparative advantage', 'export composition', 'economic growth', 'growth slowdowns', 'Chilean economy', 'institutions and education', 'export diversification', 'MIT', 'middle income trap']"
The Subversion of Male Hegemony in Charles Bukowski's Works,"Aziz, Zanyar","['Polak, Sara']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Charles Bukowski was an influential German-American poet, novelist and short storywriter who has received little scholarly attention despite his popularity among readers from all walks of life. One of the reasons his work has been overlooked by scholars is that his work has often been described as chauvinist and misogynist for depicting characters that present hegemonic gender roles. This statement is valid to a certain extent as Bukowski’s early works especially presents male characters as macho men and female characters as passive, dependent women. This thesis, however, shows that Charles Bukowski's representation of hegemonic masculinity through the character Henry Chinaski, who is the protagonist of his novels, was less one-dimensionally chauvinistic and sexist, and started to become more flexible at an earlier stage in his writing than previously thought. Scholarly critics have formerly merely focused on Bukowski’s first three novels Post Office (1971), Factotum (1975) and Women (1978) in their discussion of Bukowski’s gender portrayal. This thesis, however, takes on a broader approach by reading additional short stories, poems and another 'Chinaski' novel Hollywood (1989), in order to analyze a diachronic development in the representation of masculinity and whether this development can be traced in general throughout his work, instead of in merely his first three novels. This thesis employs gender theory to firstly read whether the characters in Bukowski’s writings subvert or adhere to hegemonic gender roles, and secondly how their behavior is motivated by their gender identity.","['Charles Bukowski', 'hegemonic masculinity', 'emphasized femininity', 'male hegemony', 'traditional gender roles', 'gender theory']"

The Interaction of Balinese Hinduism and Pancasila in the Post-Suharto Era,"Beek, Stephan Ronald Julien van","['Hadiprayitno, Irene']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper examines why the Indonesian government has a vested interest in protecting the current practice of Balinese Hinduism. It argues that the Indonesian government wants to protect Balinese Hinduism from external influences, because the tourism industry in Bali is extremely profitable and valuable to the Indonesian economy. Since it has been observed that tourists mainly come to Bali for its religious-cultural artifacts and heritage, it can be contested that invoking the monotheistic element of Pancasila justifies Balinese Hinduism’s continued existence as a unique religion and culture that should be preserved and protected from external influences such as radical Islam and Indian Hinduism. Therefore, this thesis has used secondary data analysis and qualitative research to prove that the tourist industry in Bali is very profitable and essential for the Indonesian economy and that different political strategies were employed to ensure that the Indonesian government can benefit from the preservation of Bali’s monotheistic hinduism.","['Bali', 'Hinduism', 'Indonesia', 'tourism']"

What role did negative media narratives play in the impact Russia's hosting of the 2018 FIFA World Cup had on the country's soft power?,"Quintus, Claudius","['Smith, Karen', 'Natermann, Diana']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Soft power has become increasingly important for emerging states to establish themselves on the global landscape. Sports mega events present the perfect opportunity to do so in allowing the host country to engage in nation-branding and image promotion. Academic literature suggests that hosting a sports mega event contributes extensively to the host country’s soft power. With an unfavorable international reputation, Russia recognized the necessity to improve on its soft power and hosted the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, Russia’s soft power remained seemingly unchanged despite the expected soft power impact of hosting a sports mega event. Academic literature fails to account for the crucial role of the media in determining the success of a sports mega event in combination with the fragile nature of soft power. This thesis argues that negative media narratives resulted in Russia’s inability to increase its soft power despite hosting a sports mega event, and, thereby, that the role of the media has been largely neglected in sports mega event discourse. Negative effects of sports mega events are identified, and corresponding keywords are applied in a qualitative content analysis to analyze negative media narratives in newspaper articles. Subsequently, it is explained what role the media played in the impact Russia's hosting of the 2018 FIFA World Cup had on the country's soft power based on narratives of corruption and human rights violations as well as Russia’s projection as international ‘bad guy’.","['Soft power', 'Russia', '2018 FIFA World Cup', 'sports mega events', 'media analysis', 'media narrative', 'corruption', 'image', 'Putin', 'FIFA']"

The Blockchain Technology in Russia - Friend or Foe to the Russian Authorities,"Volkov, Peter","['Bader, Max']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Russische Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"At the turn of this millennium Russia stood before the behemoth task of rising from the ashes left behind by the chaotic 90's. Russia's seemingly endless natural resources and an accompanying rise in oil prices only go so far in its development. However, to gain relevance on the world stage beyond the constant military flexing and being an energy appendage to the upper echelon industrialised countries, it needs to produce marketable technologies and secure a spot among the greatest economies. At the end of the first decade a new paradigm in the way we transact information found prominence in the minds of the tech savvy, which turned into the explosive development of the Blockchain technology. This potentially revolutionary new technology has the characteristics to alter the social fabric in which old power structures become obsolete, but at the same time provide a golden opportunity for the relative young and unbound Russian IT sector to thrive and leave a global mark. The new generation technocrats plead for full scale adoption, regulation and development of this technology, but their older and politically more powerful Soviet rooted counter parts plead against the dangers of this shift in dynamics. In this work I looked at what the blockchain technology means for Russia and how the Russian authorities took a stance in adapting the technology.","['Blockchain Technology', 'Russia', 'Politics', 'Economics.', 'Blockchain technology', 'Economics']"

Dusty Archaeology and Digital Technology,"Post, Katelin","['Hoijtink, M.H.E.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to investigate the added value of digital reconstruction technology in archaeological museums. Recent wars and conflict zones have made the world aware again of the vulnerability of the archaeological record. Therefore, the reproduction and reconstruction of archaeological material become more relevant to archaeological museums. New cutting edge techniques make museums able to perform admirable results for the communication about the content of the exhibition, the objects themselves and the museum. However, these technologies, methods and devices have both advantages and disadvantages. What defines them to be of added value to the archaeological museum? The following research question has been composed for this study: How can digital reconstruction techniques and devices be of added value to the transfer of the meaning and content of archaeological objects in archaeological museums? This research question is divided into several subquestions and answered in the three chapters this study contains. The first chapter will discuss the definition and history of reconstruction in archaeological museums, the second includes the first case study (Nineveh - The Great City ) and the third chapter includes the second case study ( Etruscans. Eminent Woman, Powerful Men). The study is set up as an inductive research because no applicable theories about added value were found in this field of research. The study will analyse academic literature, reviews, official documents published by the museums, interviews and questionnaires. It can be concluded that the digital reconstruction of the Cerveteri Tomb and the digital devices in the Nineveh exhibition were of added value in three ways: to the archaeological museum and archaeological research, the archaeological material and the visitors of archaeological museums. During the process of conducting this study, critical notes and limitations appeared. Important critical notes were the undefined expectations between the technicians and the museum professionals and the difficulties with communicating about the complex framework of questions and choices behind a reconstruction. The visitor only observes the end product of the digital technology but is not part of the process behind it, while this might be valuable to understand. Moreover, no clear answers can yet be made about if the increase in the amount of digital technology is of added value per se. There is still a long way to go to answer and solve all the questions, problems and limitations that are indirectly connected to digital technology in museums. Questions that should be answered by both museums and visitors. It is identified that authenticity is a key concept that is examined as the backbone of many issues, and it should, therefore, be better understood to analyze, interpret and initiate new future projects.","['Archaeology', 'Digital reconstruction', 'Added value', 'Nineveh The Great City', 'Etruscans.

Securitising the Compatriots During the Annexation of Crimea,"Vallverdú Delgado, Oriol","['Gerrits, André W.M.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis studies how the Russian leadership securitised the compatriots during the annexation of Crimea in 2014. To this end, the thesis delves into the historical precedents and the political discourse that shaped the securitisation of the Russian-speaking diaspora in the former Soviet republics. Through primary sources, this thesis presents a deconstruction of the recurrent themes in the political discourse, the security apparatus as well as the securitisation process with the help of the securitisation theory. The analysis of the materials studied shows that the compatriots have become a geopolitical tool for Russia when several favourable circumstances align, which allow the Kremlin to overstep the rules of ordinary politics into the realm of extraordinary measures. The compatriots have become an important asset in Russian foreign policy and, by extension, a potential security threat since they are considered Russian citizens whose identity and rights must be protected even when they are outside of Russia.","['Russia', 'Crimea', 'Securitization', 'Securitisation', 'Compatriots', 'Diaspora', 'Securitization theory', 'Ukraine crisis', 'Ukraine']"

Immersion and reading comprehension: a comparison of reading from print or video game text,"Schaepman, Jacqueline","['Verhaar, Peter']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"A study published in 2017 about leisure time use of average American citizens depicted the percentage of time Americans read, played video games or did other leisure activities on the computer. On an average day, only 21% of respondents in 2015 would read as a pastime, a decrease from the 27% of respondents that would read for pleasure in 2005. As opposed to this, the playing of video games as a pastime increased by 38%. With the preference of time use leaning towards gaming as well as the increasing popularity of smartphones and online devices, most people tend to spend more time reading from a screen rather than from print with the average adult spending around nine hours per day reading, swiping and listening to media. This, however, is claimed to crucially affect our level of text comprehension. Experts on study and learning claim that people remember less when reading something from a screen because of a multitude of factors. It has been argued, for instance, that texts are taken less seriously due to the loss of physical location, as explored in Jabr’s article “The Reading Brain in the Digital Age: The Science of Paper versus Screens”, which will be researched in more detail further on in this thesis, and that the loss of physical characteristics, such as pages put up barriers for comprehension and for memorization.Reading from electronic devices such as laptops or tablets can also affect the degree of concentration a reader experiences because of the constant presence of distractions.4 Various scholars have found that readers cannot be immersed as easily in digital texts. The notion of immersion is defined in this thesis as “the feeling of being lost in a story”; one loses track of their surroundings and devotes their full concentration of the story. But to what degree can readers feel immersed in texts that are read in video games? Many video games contain texts as well, next to still and moving images. This thesis concentrates on text-rich video games, which are video games of any genre whose most important feature is text; although text rich video games can be beautifully designed, the reader/player needs to read the text to proceed in the game. Playing a text-rich video game can be considered a hybrid genre, as it entails reading and playing video games simultaneously. It offers individuals the opportunity to do both at once meaning they will not have to choose one of the activities over the other. When considering immersion in text-rich games, Madigan believes that one of the central characteristics of an immersive game is “a strong and interesting narrative, plot, or story”. This statement, as well as research into text rich video games by Catherine Beavis, have spurred my interest in this subject. This thesis will consist of two parts. One part describes the theory behind text rich games. Among other information, this theoretical section will include a clear definition and delineation of the term ‘text rich games’. Furthermore, this part of this thesis will touch upon theories of navigability, reading comprehension, immersion, narrative, and medium to determine whether reading video game text is feasible, desirable and similar to reading from print. The second part discusses research into reading culture and immersion, based on a case study which compares experiences of a printed version of The Shamutanti Hills by Steve Jackson and the video game adaptation of the same book. The concepts that have been researched in the theoretical section will be put to the test in this section of the thesis. The main aim of the case study is to examine whether the act of reading a text in video game format can genuinely be seen as (deep) reading. Alternatively, should this solely be considered playing a video game? The hypothesis is that the degree of immersion in the text of the video game will be similar to the text of the gamebook, this due to the similarity in non-linear form of the video game and the gamebook. A gamebook is a genre of printed book that combines elements of traditional text with elements of games in which readers choose their own stories; by flipping through the pages and following clues in the numbered paragraphs, readers find out what their choices entail. Since the game primarily works with clicks and reading, the distractions are expected to be minimal. Considering reading comprehension, the hypothesis is that participants should read about the same amount of text with similar results for reading comprehension, due to the non-conventional format of the texts, and the visual cues both texts provide.","['Immersion', 'Print', 'Reading Comprehension', 'Text', 'Video game', 'Text-based', 'Choose your own adventure', 'Sorcery!']"

This thesis investigates how the meaning of the VOC is fixed through notions of past, present and future, as well as the continuity between these moments, in three exhibitions that took place in the context of the celebration: ​De Kleurrijke Wereld van de VOC (​The Colourful World of the VOC) at the Scheepvaartmuseum (Maritime museum) in Amsterdam; ​Upstream, with specifically the work of artist Shilpa Gupta (Mumbai, b. 1976) in Amsterdam and Mumbai; and ​Dutch Masters from Indian Collections,​ an initiative of the Royal Netherlands Embassy, on view in Mumbai. I trace the positions of these exhibitions​ ​ within the celebration, and, following Michel Foucault’s power-knowledge and Gloria Wekker’s application of Edward Said’s term of the cultural archive to the Dutch context, employ a discourse analysis. I argue that what is absent from the accounts of relations between past, present and future of the VOC in the three exhibitions, except for Gupta’s statements, is the idea that ​400 jaar VOC also means 400 years of Dutch colonialism, which influence dominant meaning-making processes in Dutch society today. The recognition of colonialism as structure of thinking forming a relationship between past, present and future is equivalently lacking in statements criticizing postcolonial theory today in the Netherlands.","['Shilpa Gupta', 'VOC', 'cultural archive', 'power-knowledge', 'discourse analysis', 'postcolonial theory', 'postcolonial Netherlands', 'contemporary art', 'exhibition practices']"

Continuining a Legacy: Dutch influence on the development of Nagasaki in the nineteenth century.,"Verhoeven, Davey","['Schrikker, Alicia', 'Dissel, Anita van']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Between 1639 and 1854 was the Netherlands the only European country allowed to trade with Japan. After 1854, when Commodore Perry uses gunboat diplomacy to open diplomatic contact with Japan, the unique position of the Netherlands had changed drastically. Nonetheless, the Dutch government was not eager to give up its monopoly on Japan that easily. As a result, after Japan opened, the Dutch government can be observed undertaking many projects in Japan to convince the Japanese that unique relations with the Dutch were still in the Japanese interest. Especially in Nagasaki, where the Dutch had a trading post for since the 17th century, the Dutch undertook many projects and this started to shape the city going forward. This thesis examines how Dutch influence shaped three prominent sectors in Nagasaki throughout the nineteenth century; the rising military & industrial sectors and the declining trade sector in Nagasaki. The developments in these sectors are framed within wider Japanese history of that era and also the decline of Dutch influence in the nineteenth century. The conclusion of this thesis is that the Dutch still fulfilled a prominent position within Japanese, and then especially Nagasaki, after the years of the opening in 1854. The Dutch worked hard to introduce Japan with new military and industrial knowledge, while simulataneously aiming to include within a new trade network. The Dutch supplied new materials, worked as teacher and also worked as intermediaries with other Western nations. Eventually the Dutch could not keep up with other Western nations and by the 1870s most Dutch experts had disappeared from Japan. Nonetheless, by this time their influence had played a major role in Nagasaki.

Was dit nou ethisch?,"Leering, Joy","['Burger, Peter']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek staan de percepties, meningen en oordelen van Nederlandse journalisten centraal. Onderzocht is hoe Nederlandse journalisten hun eigen professionalisme op ethisch vlak beoordelen wanneer zij slachtoffers van misdrijven benaderen, interviewen en over hen berichten. Dit is sinds 2009 niet meer met een kwalitatieve methode in Nederland onderzocht. De concepten die ten grondslag liggen aan deze studie zijn boundary work en professionalisme. Om de onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden zijn semigestructureerde interviews afgenomen onder vijftien Nederlandse journalisten, waarna deze zijn getranscribeerd en gecodeerd op basis van de grounded theory. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat de geïnterviewde journalisten vinden dat het doorvoeren van ethiek in hun dagelijks werk bijdraagt aan hun professionalisme. Zij achten ethiek belangrijk op drie punten, namelijk rondom 1) de juiste manier om een misdrijfslachtoffer te benaderen 2) de juiste manier van ervaring opdoen om met een misdrijfslachtoffer te werken en 3) de juiste manier van interviewen van en berichten over misdrijfslachtoffers. Een beperking van dit onderzoek is dat de percepties van de slachtoffers van misdrijven achterwege blijven. Vervolgonderzoek wordt dan ook aangeraden, om dit gat te vullen.","['slachtoffers', 'ethiek', 'journalistiek', 'misdrijven']"

"Border Crossing: A Threefold Critical and Reflexive Inquiry into Human Rights Film Festivals, in Particular Movies that Matter Festival","Galisinova, Katarina","['Houwen, Janna']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on human rights film festivals, in particular Movies that Matter Festival (MTMF) – a relatively small yet significant human rights film festival based in the Netherlands. Alongside the festival itself, I investigate the MTMF 2019 film program and the process of film programming leading to its creation. As a film festival with a focus on human rights issues, one can expect MTMF to attempt a varied and all-encompassing approach to its selection of themes and films. Although MTMF does not centre its film programming (and consequently its film program) to gender and genre inclusivity, it is precisely this that offers an opportunity for the study of gender and genre. In this thesis, I examine how MTMF, and specifically the film programming undertaken in 2019, draws on recent developments in contemporary human rights theory in order to implement inclusivity and diversity. As I shall establish, inclusivity and diversity are pillars of both critical film festival studies and human rights film festivals. To achieve this goal, I have organized this thesis into three main chapters. In the first chapter, I study the significance of the “Universal Declaration of Human Rights” (1948) to human rights theory and human rights film festivals today. Moreover, I investigate the fundamental theoretical concepts from human rights theory that apply to the field of human rights film festivals. In the second chapter, I closely examine 50502020 Pledge for Gender Parity and Inclusion in Film Festivals (2018) and study the MTMF 2019 film program from the perspective of gender and genre. I question the impact a film programmer’s, as well as filmmaker’s gender, may have on a film, especially given that the majority of films released in both commercial and art-house cinemas present the male gaze, as I shall demonstrate. I end with a third chapter that offers a close analysis of the process of film programming, an area which my research reveals to be sadly under-examined by film festival scholars. Here, I delve into the methods and power structures of film selection, deriving from film programmers’ presupposed ideas of on what a human rights film and a human rights film festival could be.","['human rights', 'film', 'human rights film festivals', 'inclusivity', 'diversity', 'gender', 'genre']"

Polarization and personal attacks in American presidential debates,"Fluit, Laurens","['Pilgram, Roosmaryn']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the use of ad hominem arguments in American political debates in relation to the degree of polarization. The types of ad hominem arguments, the fallaciousness of the arguments and the use of mitigation techniques are examined in this. Since an increase in polarization in United States politics is visible and ad hominem arguments are a symptom of polarization, one could expect an increase in frequency of ad hominem usage and an increase of frequency of fallacious ad hominems. Since Trump is perceived as the cause of the increasing polarization according to surveys, it could be expected that he uses more ad hominem arguments and more fallacious ad hominem arguments than his opponent. To test these hypotheses, a corpus was composed of 6 American presidential debates, 3 from the 2008 presidential campaigns and 3 from the 2016 presidential campaigns. To analyse this corpus, the four types of ad hominem arguments that Tindale (2007) distinguishes serve as guidelines. Tindale’s (2007) critical questions for identifying and evaluating ad hominem arguments are used to determine the fallaciousness of the arguments. The use of Ilie’s (2004) mitigation techniques within the corpus is also examined. This way, this study attempts to connect the evaluation of ad hominem arguments to polarization in politics. This study shows that the frequency of ad hominem use in the 2016 presidential debates was more than twice as high as in 2008. The frequency of ad hominem use was nearly equal between Trump and Clinton, but Trump’s fallacious ad hominem use had a significantly higher frequency. The amount of mitigation strategies used in the debates was found to be near zero. This means that some of the outcomes of this study are in line with the expectations: the increase in ad hominem frequency in 2016 versus 2008 and Trump’s higher frequency of fallacious ad hominem use. The fact that Trump and Clinton used a nearly equal amount of ad hominem arguments in the debates and the fact that the use of mitigation techniques was rare was not in accordance with expectations. Overall, the ad hominem use in the debates seems to support the idea of an increase in polarization in American politics. The ad hominem use in the debates also seems to support the idea that Trump has a relatively big influence on this increase, compared to his opponent.","['Polarization', 'Ad hominem', 'political debates']"

DEL COMAL A LA STREET FOOD: Gastronomía y gentrificación en la Colonia Roma de la Ciudad de México,"José, Baig","['Isla, Pablo']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Latijns-Amerikastudies (BA),Master thesis,es,"Esta tesis explora la relación entre el proceso de gentrificación de la Colonia Roma en la Ciudad de México y la oferta gastronómica de la zona, con la finalidad de determinar los mecanismos que operan en dicha relación y establecer patrones que permitan entender los valores sociales, culturales y económicos que entran en juego. Para lograrlo, se hizo una investigación bibliográfica en cuanto a los fenómenos de gentrificación en distintos lugares del mundo, así como de la oferta gastronómica como agente y síntoma de la gentrificación. Dicha investigación se complementó con un trabajo de campo en la Colonia Roma, en el que se observaron tendencias en la gastronomía, en el mercado inmobiliario y en los cambios de patrones culturales y sociales de la zona. Como resultado, se determinó que existe una relación simbiótica entre la oferta gastronómica y los procesos de gentrificación, influida por factores como la globalización, las políticas urbanísticas neoliberales, la mala planificación urbana, la corrupción, la especulación financiera e inmobiliaria y hasta el racismo. La oferta gastronómica funciona como un ariete que permite, además, mostrar una cara amable del proceso, mientras oculta procesos injustos y nefastas consecuencias. A futuro se recomienda profundizar el estudio de esta relación, poniendo especial énfasis en las características fundamentales del fenómeno en el contexto latinoamericano. This thesis explores the relationship between the gentrification process of Colonia Roma in Mexico City and the gastronomic offer, to determine the mechanisms that operate in said relationship and establish patterns that allow learning the social and cultural values, as well as the economic factors that come into play. Besides the bibliographic investigation on gentrification phenomena in different parts of the world, and the gastronomic offer as an agent and symptom of gentrification, this research was complemented by a field research in Colonia Roma, where trends were observed in gastronomy, the real estate market, and the changes of cultural and social patterns in the area. As a result, it was determined that there exists a symbiotic relationship between the gastronomic offer and the gentrification processes, influenced by factors such as globalization, neoliberal urban policies, poor urban planning, corruption, financial and real estate speculation and even racism. The gentrified food offer allows showing a kind face of the process while hiding unfair methods and dire consequences. For future research, it is recommended to deepen the study of this relationship, with special emphasis on the fundamental characteristics of the phenomenon in the Latin American context.","['gentrificación', 'gastronomía', 'políticas urbanas', 'especulación inmobiliaria', 'desplazamiento']"

Notre analyse de la représentation du lesbianisme dans le roman permet une meilleure compréhension de ce rôle. Les différents personnages lesbiens et leurs rapports ont été étudiés profondément pour répondre aux questions fondamentales de notre recherche : quelles ressemblances et différences y a-t-il entre les différentes images du lesbianisme dans ""À la recherche du temps perdu"" et quelle en est la fonction dans le récit ? Il ressort de l’analyse que le lesbianisme dans la ""Recherche"" est représenté comme un phénomène équivoque à multiples facettes, que caractérisent la grande variété et la multiplicité. L’image du lesbianisme est caractérisée par des contrastes, qui semblent parfois même être contradictoires. En ce qui concerne la fonction des rapports lesbiens au niveau du récit, on en pourrait distinguer trois principales : l’augmentation de la jalousie du protagoniste, la diminution de ses doutes sur l’amour d’Albertine pour les femmes et l’accentuation de l’exclusion du narrateur mâle. Ces éléments contribuent tous à l’intrigue principale. Considérant l’importance des doubles dans la ""Recherche"", on pourrait en plus voir dans l’amour lesbien un double contrastant de l’amour proustien et de l’amour homosexuel masculin.","['Marcel Proust', 'À la recherche du temps perdu', 'Images', 'Lesbianisme', 'Gomorrhe', 'Albertine']"

The Comfort Women Issue: The Power of Apology in Postwar Reconciliation,"Meijer, Casper","['Links, Stacey']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores the ongoing international dispute between Japan and South Korea concerning the issue of WWII sex-slaves known as ‘comfort women’. The main focus lies on the question how Japanese official apologies for this issue contribute to the successful reconciliation between South Korea and Japan. By using soft power theory to look at the transmission, context and reception of three major Japanese apologies from the 1990s until today, this thesis finds that, Japanese national apologies do not contribute to successful postwar reconciliation. Due to a mismatch between Japanese presentation, compensation and South Korean expectation, the apologies do not lead towards soft power. Domestic political context only further amplifies the gap between transmission and reception, while international pressure does not manage to bridge the gap either. Therefore, this thesis argues that current Japanese apologies for the issue known as the ‘comfort women issue’ do not positively contribute towards successful reconciliation. The potential that future apologies can contribute however, cannot be ruled out.","['Apology', 'Comfort Women', 'International Relations', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Reconciliation', 'Soft Power']"

The protracted nature of the seventy-year-long conflict and the struggle for self-determination of the Kashmiri bears resemblance to the strife between Israel and Palestine since the former’s founding in 1948, though this conflict has garnered greater media attention. In both cases, the impact of seemingly endless conflict and violence has impacted the lives of generations of children. The ways in which children can, and do, influence these conflicts - actively and passively - remains a hitherto under-explored area in academia. The present investigation seeks to address this issue with reference to cultural productions in the form of graphic novels. By cross-examining against actual instances of children, who have become symbols for the respective struggles and an examination of the response by the relevant authorities, this paper teases out the importance of children to both cases. Taken together with the reception received locally, nationally and internationally, a fresh light is cast upon the role of children as symbols and agents in protracted conflicts.","['Kashmir', 'Art', 'Children', 'Palestine', 'Armed Conflict', 'The subaltern']"

The joining, or not, of the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) has raised the topic of women’s rights to the forefront in the international enforcement of human rights (Barlow and Akbarzadeh 2006, 1481). Involvement in politics in Europe extended to women’s policy agencies and strong feminist groups having the possibility of influencing the upcoming legislation by informing policy makers about the differing implications of a policy for the genders. In understanding the importance of the state as a player in women’s empowerment, the authors discuss the success of “state feminism” in postindustrial democracies (Haussman and Sauer 2007, 1-2). In the context of Egypt, and for the remainder of this thesis, state feminism is defined as “the recognition of women as enfranchised citizens and the explicit commitment by the Nasser regime to liberate women in order to guarantee their inclusion and participation in the postrevolutionary nation on an equal footing with men” (Bier 2011, 3). There is huge value in the study of women’s rights globally, but studied in relation to the state it can offer real solutions to moving women’s empowerment another step forward. The research question proposed for this thesis addresses exactly this by investigating the state-level resources, as well as the alternative resources, available to women’s political power.","['Egyptian State', 'The State and Gender', ""Women's Political Emancipation"", 'Islamic Feminism']"

(Stefano)']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The development cooperation landscape is changing, with more actors and new approaches coming to the fore. However, less is sometimes more: there seems to be a clear division between the principles and methods of traditional donors and non- traditional donors, also known as South-South Cooperation (SSC) partners. Whilst traditional donors are claimed to reproduce inequality and dependency in recipient states through their policies, SSC partners are believed to show solidarity with these states through horizontal partnerships. In order to discover the accuracy of these statements, this thesis will examine the relations between traditional donors, SSC partners and recipient states from a postcolonial perspective. The thesis will focus on the European Union (EU) as a traditional donor; Turkey as a South-South Cooperation partner; and Somalia as a recipient. The hypothesis that will be tested in this thesis is as follows: “Turkey is a more egalitarian development aid donor than the EU.” The thesis concludes that this hypothesis is correct. The EU is involved in Somalia to address its own interests, namely its security and migration concerns. Moreover, by using political conditionality, the EU imposes its values on Somalia by incentivizing aid. Turkey also seeks to benefit from engaging with Somalia. Its interests lie in its international status as well as its economy. However, Turkey has engaged with Somalia from a demands-driven approach, taking Somalia’s needs and considerations as the foundation for its policies. This makes them a more egalitarian partner than the EU.","['Developmeny aid', 'postcolonial theory']"

Moreover, it will try to introduce in its analysis some often ignored element of Tatarstan foreign relations, such as the Tatar diaspora and migration. It should be noted that, because of a lack of sources and available data, a large part of the study will concentrate on the first two decades of the RT, between 1990 and 2010, but it will nevertheless include more recent events when possible. The importance of this topic is not only linked to the lack of academic research, but also to the current instability facing the Russian Federation and the rise of a renewed nationalist sentiment among various ethnic minorities, including Tatars. Furthermore, the gradual withdrawal of autonomy rights by Putin administration puts Tatarstan and its political elite in a difficult position and opens the door for a renewal of ethnic and political tensions.","['Nationalism', 'Tatarstan', 'Paradiplomacy', 'Russian Federation', 'Federalism']"
Blurred Boundaries in Early Dutch Photography: Petit Genre and the Photogram,"Daems, Joëlle","['Westgeest, Helen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"At the beginning of the early twentieth century, various photographic societies were established such as the Brotherhood of the Linked Ring in England and de Nederlandse Club voor FotoKunst in the Netherlands, who profiled themselves as artists and promoted photography as a fine art. It is often argued that they solely produced images to evoke emotions or atmosphere, and that they exclusively looked back at painting styles to reach for the ultimate goal of including photography as a fine art. Moreover, the photographs are mainly described on the basis of art historical categories, techniques, or the biographies of the photographers. I argue that these perspectives neglect the crucial fact that the photographs are photographs, and that new perspectives are needed. Therefore, this research will take a more theoretical approach, by focussing on early Dutch photography from 1913-1927, the medium of photography, and the photo-theoretical concepts of light, straight and composed photography, and time. In this research, the focus will specifically be on two seemingly different photographs: a photograph which looks like a seventeenth-century genre painting by Richard Polak and a cameraless photogram by Henri Berssenbrugge. In this analysis, the attention will be aimed on the fact that these photographs are photographs, by moving to the heart of the medium, and eventually highlighting that within this core, the boundaries are blurred. By combining the earliest theories of photography, with more modern and contemporary arguments considering the medium, new perspectives on the two photographs will be provided, which gives revived attention to the neglected or forgotten early Dutch photography. By taking a different perspective, it is shown that the photographs are more than the reproduction of paintings, or more than just another painterly technique for creating figurative and abstract painting.",

Om hun onafhankelijk te bewaren vochten hij en zijn vader Haidar Ali vier oorlogen uit met de uitdijende East Indian Company, waarbij zij militaire steun zochten bij Frankrijk. In 1787 stuurde Tipu Sultan een diplomatieke missie naar Frankrijk en ruim tien jaar later nog een tweede missie. Wat waren de motieven, de opzet en resultaten van deze missies, wat was zijn politieke verhouding met Frankrijk? Achtergrondvraag daarbij is de Franse politiek ten opzichte van India in de tweede helft van de achttiende eeuw in het licht van de twee grote Frans-Engelse oorlogen, de Zevenjarige Oorlog en de Amerikaanse Onafhankelijksoorlog. Structurele factoren blokkeerden Tipu Sultans ambitie en zorgden voor zijn ondergang. Het was voor de Fransen onmogelijk een oorlog op twee fronten te voeren, waarbij zij prioriteit gaven aan de oorlog in Noord-Amerika; nadien kalfde hun positie in India verder af en brak de Franse Revolutie uit. Tegelijkertijd groeide de Engelse machtspositie in India verder en werden zij volledig dominant op zee. Daarmee werd Tipu Sultan vermalen tussen de inconsistentie en de machteloosheid van de Fransen enerzijds en de macht en vastbeslotenheid van de Engelsen anderzijds.","['Tipu Sultan', 'Mysore', 'India', '1782-1799', 'Mission Versailles 1788-1789', 'Misson Île de France', 'EIC', 'Haidar Ali', 'Policy w.r.t.

Over het strategisch overtuigend brengen van een autoriteitsargument in reclames voor lichaamsverzorging,"Kleijwegt, Francis","['Pilgram, Roosmaryn']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dagelijks zijn er veel verschillende reclames te zien waarin producten voor het lichaam worden aangeprezen. Een manier om deze lichaamsverzorgingsproducten aan te prijzen is door middel van een autoriteit die vertelt over het product of op een andere gunstige wijze met het product wordt geassocieerd. Hiermee proberen de reclamemakers het publiek aan te sporen tot het kopen en gebruiken van een product. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te analyseren hoe het publiek kan worden overtuigd door middel van autoriteitsargumentatie in reclames voor lichaamsverzorging. Hiervoor is de volgende hoofdvraag opgesteld: Op welke manier(en) wordt een autoriteitsargument strategisch zo overtuigend mogelijk gebracht in reclames voor lichaamsverzorging? Om deze vraag te kunnen beantwoorden, zijn er analyses uitgevoerd op basis van de uitgebreide pragma-dialectiek. Er is een corpus samengesteld van twintig lichaamsverzorgingsreclames die allereerst zijn getranscribeerd. Vervolgens zijn ook de argumentatiestructuren van de reclames opgesteld. Aan de hand van deze transcripties en argumentatiestructuren is er door middel van analytische inductie onderzocht op welke manieren een autoriteitsargument overtuigend kan worden gebracht. Uit deze analyse blijkt dat reclamemakers een autoriteitsargument in lichaamsverzorgingsreclames door middel van zes strategieën overtuigend kunnen brengen: ‘tonen en benoemen van deskundigheid’, ‘aantonen van een ontwikkeling binnen een vakgebied’, ‘benoemen van een vakgebied’, ‘impliciet laten van een standpunt’, ‘benoemen van externe autoriteiten’ en ‘gebruik maken van een bepaald jargon of woordgebruik’.

"The Definition of ""Power"" as a Model for the Definition of Knowledge","Chen, Yi","['Haas, Frans de']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"I argue for a reconstruction of the relation between the mathematical example of defining “power” by Theaetetus and the later three attempted definitions of knowledge in Plato’s dialogue: the Theaetetus. The reason for the reconstruction is that the relation in question is either understood weakly in an analogical way or negatively as a contrast of methods between mathematics or philosophy. I maintain that the textual evidence in the Theaetetus for a positive reading of this relation should be respected and the mathematical example of defining “power” is actually a model for the discussion of defining knowledge. The analysis will show that in Theaetetus’ definition of power, he goes from circumscribing the infinite in √3 and √5 in one line to dividing the number into groups; that is, the definition of “power” requires presenting the infinite in a certain number, which could be further positioned in a certain group of number by division. The definition of knowledge goes through similar stages. Relevant discussions move from those on the infinite or many to the necessity of one and then to those on the relation between wholes and parts. Therefore, the mathematical example of defining “power” is a model for defining “knowledge” in that it provides a crucial framework that is the very concern of knowledge.","['power', 'knowledge', 'infinite or unlimited', 'one', 'whole', 'parts']"
"Local Memory of Tragedy amidst a War of Memories: A Case Study of the 2nd of May Events in Odesa, Ukraine","Diepen, Mischa van","['Bader, Max']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The present thesis addresses the local memory of the 2nd of May events in Odesa, Ukraine, a culmination of fights between supporters and opponents of the Maidan government that obtained power in February 2014. The respective street clashes in Odesa killed six individuals, while 42 lost their lives in a fire in the Trade Union Building. At the surface, these clashes were a contraposition between groupings favoring a Ukrainian nationalistic vector and their opponents desiring pro-Russian policies. However, the local element of these clashes seems to transcend this binary approach. Situated in memory theory, the present thesis addresses the way the memory of these events among Odesans fits into the spectrum spanned by a pro-Ukrainian and a pro-Russian frame of interpreting history. Through a month of field work, during which 41 semi-structured interviews were conducted with Odesans, the thesis answers the central research question: “How do individual and collective memory regarding the 2nd of May events in Odesa interact?”. The thesis identifies four narratives regarding the 2nd of May events: a pro-Ukrainian, an ‘old-Odesan’, an apolitical, and a pro-Russian narrative. Analysis of these narratives provides the following conclusions. Firstly, the use of history as an argument to explain for the present varied widely. Some built their perception of the present events on analogies to events dating to World War II, while others situate their memory more in relation to contemporary events. Secondly, the absence of an authoritative source of information regarding the 2nd of May events is identified, leading to a construction of the interviewees’ memory on personal accounts and hearsays from others. This has resulted in wildly divergent accounts and theories of what happened on the respective day. Thirdly, the specific character of the 2nd of May events, which consisted of two largely disjunct sets of events, is argued to facilitate the inclusion of narratives regarding these events into coherent storylines for both conflicting sides. Fourthly, the different layers of identification that are expressed through the different narratives are analyzed. It is argued that shared belief systems account for shared memories in a more overarching way than membership of specific social groups does. The negotiation of the city of Odesa throughout the different narratives is analyzed in a closing argument.","['Memory', 'Ukraine', 'Identity', 'Odessa', 'Conflict', 'Trauma']"
Preserving Cultural Heritage Through Digitisation. Lebanon as a Case Study,"Bardawil, Sana","['Verhaar, Peter']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Lebanon's religious institutions have been preserving the country's religious and cultural heritage since they were established several centuries ago. Digitisation is the latest tool in the preservation efforts by the country's academic institutions, some established by religious orders initially, though secular now. They are building on a well-established tradition of scholarship and research. The efforts by the country's academic institutions, who have acted as safeguards of their own religious and cultural heritage, are a recognition of the need to preserve that legacy for future generations. These academic institutions have taken up this responsibility in the absence of state efforts to do so, due to wars over the centuries and changes in ruling powers, and a lack of strong government institutions to lead on that front. Digitisation has already brought down barriers and will help the country build digital scholarship and ensure its wealth of cultural heritage is safeguarded as well as shared beyond its borders.",['Cultural Heritage Preservation & Digitisation']
The Art of Staging: The Implementation of a Scenographic Concept and Approach in the new Acropolis Museum,"Malegkanou, Katerina","['Zijlmans, Kitty']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Scenography is a contemporary staging practice that continues to expand its influence in the exhibition context and within the exhibition scene. It can be considered as a tool aiming to reconfigure and further support the existed exhibition space and as a consequence, this is the point where scenography meets contemporary curating. The aim of this thesis is to examine the interrelation between the use of scenography (scenographic practices) and contemporary curating, its emergence, its influence and contribution to the exhibition field. If we consider exhibition spaces as theatrical/performance stages with settings, actors and audience, the notion of staging and the scenography of the space contribute to transforming the curating practices regarding narration, storytelling, dramaturgy, and architecture. With a case study of the New Acropolis Museum, I attempt to demonstrate scenography’s wide-ranging capacity to deal with contemporary issues. The New Acropolis Museum focuses on the elevation of sculptures and artifacts, emphasizing an association with the history and symbolism of the past. The architecture of the building, the museological design and arrangement of the space and exhibits, the natural lighting that flows through the glass walls and surfaces, and the view of the Acropolis hill (actual monument) are elements that reinforce the narration and the storytelling process in the museum and consequently offer an engaging experience for visitors.","['scenography', 'staging practice', 'new Acropolis Museum', 'social scenography']"
"Multilingual The Hague: Municipal language policy, politics, and practice","Thieme, Anne-Mieke","['Tieken-Boon van Ostade, Ingrid']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The reality in many cities across the world today is one of multilingualism (Kraus & Grin, 2018; Smakman & Heinrich, 2018). Municipalities need to deal with this linguistic superdiversity to be able to communicate with their citizens and to navigate inhabitants’ linguistic needs (Blommaert & Rampton, 2001; Kraus & Grin, 2018; Skrandies, 2016). There is a relative lack of research into municipal language policy, while it can have a profound impact on citizens’ lives and sociolinguistic identities (Backhaus, 2012; Siiner, 2014; Skrandies, 2016). The Hague, as the third largest city in The Netherlands, is a prime, but understudied example of such a multilingual reality and associated municipal language policy and politics (Tieken-Boon van Ostade, 2019). Moreover, allegedly, The Hague is the most segregated city in The Netherlands (Cornips et al., 2018), which makes issues of language policy, politics, and practice all the more prominent and interesting to investigate. Therefore, I examined two research questions: what are the language policy and politics regarding multilingualism in The Hague and how are these reflected in practice in municipal signage? The analysis takes a sociolinguistic and language policy perspective to answer these questions and is threefold: it consists of a Corpus Analysis of the language policy and politics of the current municipal council, a Critical Discourse Analysis of two language policy documents, and a Linguistic Landscape analysis of municipal signs in the city. The results of all three analyses indicate that the municipality focuses mostly on the acquisition and use of Dutch and generally describes multilingualism negatively, instead of as a resource. More specifically, the multilingualism of citizens who are already disadvantaged is viewed as an obstacle, while the multilingualism of so-called expats and internationals is embraced. This points to a social divide in The Hague based on socioeconomic class, language, and ethnic background, and is indicative of language ideologies about nationalism and economics (Skrandies, 2016).","['sociolinguistics', 'urban multilingualism', 'language policy', 'language politics', 'linguistic landscape', 'The Hague']"

A compelling example from Mexico City is the 2015 performance piece Plan Acalote by contemporary art collective Plan Acalli, which reenacted the journey of a traditional acalli boat across Mexico City, crossing highways and avenues that were once canals. This thesis examines the ecological potential of this artwork by studying the performance and its context through a framework of materialist posthumanism. I argue that Plan Acalote crucially enabled human participants to develop environmental skills and awareness and involved ritual, pilgrimage-like encounters. I propose that, in this way, the acalli boat’s journey can thus be read as a material transformation or “becoming” of paved urban roads into an acalote, or Nahua waterway: a collaborative, situated and performative strategy towards research, environmental awareness and art. Therefore, Plan Acalote ultimately demonstrated the potential of a shift in cosmovision through art as a viable approach to furthering ecological goals.","['performance', 'posthumanism', 'materialism', 'Mexico', 'Xochimilco', 'ecology', 'environment', 'agency', 'cosmovision', 'contemporary art', 'water']"

Ivan Alexandrovitsj Iljin: een herleving van Iljins gedachtegoed in postcommunistisch Rusland.,"Kooge, Mats Jurriaan","['Kern, J.H.C.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Ivan Alexandrovitsj Iljin (1883-1954) was een Russische filosoof en anticommunistisch schrijver van het zogenaamde witte gedachtegoed. Als historisch figuur is hij relevant gemaakt door middel van aanhalingen in staatspropaganda door de Russische regeringen vanaf 2000, met Vladimir Poetin als geportretteerd hoofd van Iljins spirituele herleving. De herleving gaat vrijwel uitsluitend over de inhoud van de essays uit de bundel Onze Taken (geschreven 1948-1954), waarin Iljin bijvoorbeeld schreef over een postcommunistisch Rusland. Het wetenschappelijk debat betreft Iljins stigma als fascistisch denker en ook zijn omstreden omschrijving als 'gids voor het Kremlin'. Het ontbrak het debat aan een algeheel onderzoek naar Iljins gedachtegoed aan de ene kant en de toepassing van het verleden (Iljins leven) in het heden (Iljins herontdekking) aan de andere kant. Daarom is onderzocht hoe Iljins gedachtegoed tegenwoordig wordt gebruikt en hoe de postcommunistische herleving van zijn gedachtegoed valt te verklaren. Een conclusie is gevormd op basis van een tweedelige structuur - van vóór en ná Iljins overlijden - met elk twee paragrafen en deelconclusies. Respectievelijk wordt gekeken naar wie Iljin was, wat Iljin schreef (in Onze Taken), hoe de herontdekking van zijn gedachtegoed voltrok, en hoe zijn teksten in postcommunistisch Rusland zijn toegepast. Voor de eerste paragraaf zijn biografische gegevens geraadpleegd, voor de tweede de primaire bron Onze Taken, voor de derde wetenschappelijke literatuur aangevuld met journalistiek onderzoek, en voor de vierde een citatenonderzoek op basis van transcripten als primair bronmateriaal. Tot slot is geconcludeerd dat Iljins gedachtegoed (lees: Onze Taken) een voor Rusland eigen alternatief biedt op het waardensysteem van het Westen, waarbij rechtvaardiging voor de autoritaire machtsvergroting centraal staat onder het mom van nationale stabiliteit en eenheid.","['Rusland', 'Vladimir Poetin', 'Filosoof', 'Sovjet-Unie', 'Witte gedachtegoed']"
Synchronistic Destiny: A Philosophical Inquiry into C.G. Jung's Depth Psychology,"Oskam, Suzanne","['Gijsbers, Victor']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"The concept of destiny is most regularly invoked in everyday life at the moments when events are so “coincidental” that it gives one at least the impression that they were pre-ordained by some mysterious, transcendent force or principle. Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung proposes the synchronicity principle to explain such phenomena. This thesis asks: what are the implications of C.G. Jung’s depth psychology, and his synchronicity principle in particular, for the personal significance and attainment of destiny? Destiny can be said to be the knowing awareness of the realization of the course of one’s life which is always to some extent meaningful to the experiencing subject. The causality principle cannot account for the meaningful connections required for destiny, that is, it cannot explain why destiny is important to the individual. To understand the experience of destiny, Carl Jung’s principle of synchronicity might be more useful. Synchronistic phenomena require explanation from the perspective of a worldview that allows for the interconnectedness of all that exists. For the synchronicity principle to be effective as principle of explanation, then, it needs to stand in a necessary relationship to totality, which Jung understands as the archetypes in the collective unconscious, which form patterns. The conscious awareness and interpretation of the unfoldment of such archetypal patterns in life is what we might call destiny. Destiny, as knowledge about one’s life course is never concrete in showing what one might expect to happen but gives one a subtle glance at the larger pattern of reality to find oneself in the meaningful order of totality. One can come to know what role one is to play within the whole of reality on the basis of the interpretative framework that is offered by the archetypal expressions in synchronistic experiences. Destiny, in conclusion, is foremost about getting to know oneself: self-knowledge forms a hermeneutical framework from which one interprets (the events of) one’s life course. Synchronistic phenomena contribute to self-knowledge in a uniquely compelling and valuable way by offering unconscious guidance through meaningful co-incidences, but, finally, the responsibility rests with the individual whether to use this guidance to their advantage in obtaining destiny.","['Destiny', 'Synchronicity', 'Individuation', 'Knowledge', 'Hermeneutics', 'Intuition', 'Self', 'Archetypes', 'Collective Unconscious', 'Depth Psychology', 'Totality']"
Coping with Crisis. Italian Foreign Policy during the 2011 Arab Spring Induced Libyan Revolution.,"Ruiter, Lucas","['Macaj, Gjovalin']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Historically, Libya has played a crucial part in Italian foreign policy inside the Middle East- and North-African (MENA) region. Serving as the prime supplier of fossil fuels, Libya has also long functioned as a transit point for migrants taking the route toward the European continent. To safeguard both energy security and irregular migratory flows, Italy has invested in creating a mutually beneficial relationship with Libyan leader Moammar al-Ghaddafi. The 2011 Arab Spring would trouble these bonds, as Ghaddafi's reign was challenged - and ultimately toppled. Italian foreign policy-making has been described as notoriously self-contradicting, inefficient and serving self-interest at best. To test these theories, the events and resulting Italian foreign policy during the Libyan Revolution in 2011 serve as a case study. It will be shown that Italian foreign policy produced some tangible short-term results, especially in terms of energy security. Nonetheless, the processes that preceded these results were characterized by periods of uncertainty in Italian foreign policy making. Indeed, several actions of the Italian government proved to acknowledge the 'propensity for self-contradiction' that has long characterized Italian foreign policy-making in International Relations theory.","['Libyan Revolution', 'Energy Security', 'Migration Politics', 'Arab Spring', 'Italian Foreign Policy', 'Italian-Libyan Relations', 'Norms and Ethics in International Relations', 'Berlusconi Government', 'Ghaddafi']"

Both states are concerned about the impact of climate change in the Arctic region and the different kinds of consequences it may have for their state. Both states contribute to the AC with scientific knowledge, and they participate in several Working Groups. Critical discourse analysis (CDA) helps explore and understand the meaning of the role of the Netherlands and China as Observers, leading to an answer to how both states use science diplomacy (SD) as a strategic tool and potentially revealing hidden agendas in terms of the nature of their economic interest. Although CDA did not unfold hidden agendas of both states, what can be said is that probably both states are using SD as a strategic tool to shift attention away from their own (economic) incentives.","['CDA', 'Arctic Council', 'Science Diplomacy', 'Diplomacy', 'China', 'The Netherlands']"
Are You F&#*@ing Kidding Me: Strategies and Functions of Humour and Swearing in Gaming Discourse,"Bruin, Kimberly de","['Terkourafi, Marina']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This dissertation aims to analyse the discourse strategies and functions of humour and swearing used among a group of Dutch-speaking young adults who are playing videogames. It focusses mainly on identifying which strategies and functions humour and swearing serve, and the frequency of these in both winning and losing discourse (discourse during moments of winning and losing in-game). It also looks at the overall relationship between humour and swearing. The dissertation presents data in the form of audio and video recordings of seven male and six female young adults who play five different video games in the same physical space. After establishing several strategies and functions of humour and swearing based on those presented by Hay (2010), a qualitative analysis of the data revealed not only additional functions and strategies that had not yet been proposed, but also patterns regarding the frequency of certain strategies and functions. The results suggest that humour and swearing have a special function during winning and losing discourse. Additionally, swearing and humour are applied for different goals; whereas swearing mainly serves a psychological function and is used as a way of dealing with losing face, humour is mainly applied to create or maintain solidarity among the players of the game. Regarding the relationship between humour and swearing, it was found that swearing was applied to enhance humour in several cases. Hay, J. (2010).

Hong Kong Anti-Extradition Protests. Why the protests can be problematic for “One Country Two Systems”. A discourse analysis of the protest slogans.,"Lam, Kingman","[""d'Hooghe, Ingrid""]",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Hong Kong have seen several large protests since the handover in 1997. These protests seems to have been emerged out of a growing discontent with the meddling of China in to its affairs. Hong Kong is a ""Special Administrative Region"" of China, it operates under the ""One Country Two System"" principle, which means it has its own government and can govern itself. Currently Hong Kong has once again been affected by ongoing anti-government demonstrations for over half a year. It seems that the protest also indicates a growing concern for the stipulated principle of “One Country Two Systems”. This paper will try to answer the question: Why do a large group of people in Hong Kong perceive the principle of “One Country Two Systems” as problematic? It will do so by conducting a discourse and thematic analysis on the slogans used in this protest. It is suggested that the slogans show a unique Hong Kong identity that can in part cause implications for the current principle of “One Country Two Systems”","['Hong Kong', 'Protests', 'One Country Two Systems', 'Identity', 'Revolution', 'China', 'Hong Kong Identity', 'Slogans', 'Discourse Analysis', 'Colony']"

No Compensation Without Recognition: Tribal Sovereignty and Uranium Mining in the United States,"Voordt, Charlotte van der","['Fazzi, Dario']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores an underlying conflict that exists between Native Americans and non-Natives in United States society and that mostly translates into environmental exploitation or environmental injustice. Native Americans differ from other minorities living in the United States, due to their sovereign status. Such a status, however, has not always shielded Native Americans from phenomena of marginalization or, as this thesis will prove, economic and environmental exploitation. The historical development of uranium mining in the last century gives a perfect illustration of this, and it will be used as a case study to explain the conflict being played out on tribal lands. The economic and sociocultural harms of this historical development have further entrenched Native Americans in the lowest socioeconomic layers of American society, and the repercussions of such a phenomenon of further marginalization will persist for future generations. Ultimately, this thesis argues for the importance of strengthening tribal sovereignty in the interest of preserving tribal tradition as well as the natural environment Native Americans inhabit.","['Tribal Sovereignty', 'Uranium Mining', 'United States', 'Native Americans', 'Environmental Justice', 'Minority rights', 'Radiation Exposure Compensation Act', 'Toxic legacy']"

Existential constructions in Finnish and Hungarian,"Chabhar, Layla","['Crevels, Mily']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis looks at positive and negative existentials in Finnish and Hungarian with the help of the framework of Denis Creissels’ 7 types of existentials for the positive constructions, as well as Croft’s Cycle for the negative constructions. The findings are that neither language fits neatly within Creissels’ types, as both show several different constructions. Finnish has three distinct ways of forming existentials: ‘olla + locative’, ‘olla + agent participle of olla + locative’, or a ‘copula only’ construction. Hungarian has two different ways of forming existentials: with ‘lenni + locative’, as well as a ‘copula only’ construction. Not every construction is grammatical in every context. Often existentials cannot be clearly separated from locatives and possessives. Generally, word order and context work together with a specific construction to somewhat differentiate it from other constructions. However, multiple interpretations of a single construction are often possible, so this is not absolute. These findings go against multiple claims often made in conventional literature.","['existentials', 'Finnish', 'Hungarian', 'syntax', 'morphosyntax', 'comparative']"

(De)judicializing the Political. An Agonistic Practice of Constitutional Rights Adjudication,"Esser, Joyce","['Fossen, Thomas']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the intersection of agonistic theory and legal practice, by examining the position of the judge in adjudicating constitutional rights. It does so from the perspective of the agonistic paradox: any contesting act will have to refer to the discourse it aims to contest by claiming to have always belonged to it, thereby legitimizing it in the first place. Accordingly, rights are the internal product of a contestatory practice of rights claiming. Although their true legitimacy is ever deferred, they are constantly affirmed as part of our legal order through the process of claiming hegemonic rights and counter-claiming emancipatory rights. This thesis locates the position of the judge in the middle of this impossible paradox: he has to pin down the content of rights, which is at the same time undecidable. Still, these contradicting sides of the paradox together push him towards the horizon of legitimacy and give him his value within the agonistic framework: he both judicializes (giving the order its necessary stability) and dejudicializes (offering the excluded a forum for new interpretations). The thesis concludes with several observations on contemporary rights adjudication: in hegemonically producing law, the judge risks losing legitimacy and turning those disagreeing against him; yet neither can he simply affirm democratic outcome. He has to walk the fine line between both, which is constantly, but always temporarily, being drawn by his (de)judicializing decisions, for which he can only be responsible himself.",

Interrogating Britain in Yemen: humanitarianism & counterterrorism in the (inter)national interest?,"Sarwar, Saif","['Thakur, Vineet']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The purpose of this thesis is to provide a deeper understanding of the British government’s discursive and practical involvement in the Saudi-led coalition’s ‘Operation Restoring Hope’, in Yemen. To do so, it pursues three central arguments. First, using the de-classified governmental record, it is argued that Anglo-Yemeni relations can be characterised by two interlinked political-economic objectives rooted in colonial governance. Namely, the objectives to shape a political environment favourable for British commercial enterprise. Second, it is argued that officials employ two interwoven discourses which represent the government’s involvement in terms of solving a humanitarian crisis and countering terrorism. Using a critical discourse analysis, this section will draw upon statements from leading officials and will analyse the ways in which the government represents its involvement in Yemen. Here, it is shown that officials cast Britain as a humanitarian actor in a conflict between good and evil. Further, it is argued that these discursive choices accompany and legitimate the performance of practices (i.e. blockade and aerial bombing) which are largely responsible for the humanitarian crisis and structural violence to which the government is responding. Finally, it is argued that the government’s discourse and practices rely on an unsupported appeal to the national interest. Rather, Britain’s involvement in Yemen is more clearly understood as a part of a wider form of governance under which the prosperity and security of an elite constituency is prioritised over that of the wider population.",

The focus is placed on the role of the military and mandatory military service in South Korean society and how conscription constitutes masculinity, diffuses ideas, beliefs, and values among young Korean men, and how this can have an influence on their behavior. Factors such as the instilment of military values, domination and control, the militarized culture of sexuality, and gender power structures within the military draft system are of particular importance. This paper shows that military conscription and militarism contribute to an intensification of the frictions between gender and sexuality within Korean society through the systematic promotion of hypermasculinity. In this regard, this thesis argues that Korean women have been continuously portrayed as the weaker and lesser ‘other’ by the military over the course of history, and that this othering has helped affirm masculinity and dominance over the ‘weaker’ other, which in turn legitimizes and contributes to sexual violence. Here, the internet provides a communal space for the extension of sexual violence, and with this the exercise of this dominance over and shaming of the ‘other’ with more ease and anonymity, which contributes to the growing spy camera and revenge porn epidemic in South Korea.","['Conscription', 'Molka', 'Revenge porn', 'Sexuality', 'Power', 'Sexual violence', 'Military', 'Militarism', 'Gender']"

The Impact of Student Debts in the United States: The End of the American Dream?,"Nthenge, Maryclare","['Fazzi, D.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the last decade, there has been an exponential increase in the cost of higher education in the United States (US). Given that higher education in the US plays a significant role in defining and qualifying the American middle class and American society at large, it is admissible to investigate the following research question: how is the rising student debt in the US affecting the American Dream? This paper analyzes the research question by first, deliberating on various perspectives and arguments of scholars on this issue. Second, this paper defines what the American Dream is and thereafter, uses quantitative data to examine the current state of student loans and student debts in the United States. Interviews are carried out to support and refute the hypothesis of this paper and illustrate a direct correlation between the student debt crisis and the crisis of the American Dream. Finally, the paper also explores current and prospective solutions and policy advice for addressing the student debt issue in the US. This paper concludes that the rise in student debt is affecting the American Dream because it is hindering graduate students from achieving their American Dream. The current American generation defines the American Dream as financial freedom, wealth, the ability to buy a house, security, and equality.","['The American Dream', 'American middle class', 'American society', 'Cost of higher education', 'Rising student debt', 'United States student debt', 'United States student loans', 'Student Debts']"
Routine of bijzaak? Hoe verifiëren Nederlandse journalisten amateurbeeldmateriaal van sociale media?,"De Groot, Diederik","['Burger, Peter']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie wordt onderzoek gedaan naar hoe Nederlandse journalisten amateurbeeldmateriaal van sociale media verifiëren. Dit gebeurt aan de hand van het onderzoek dat Brandtzaeg et. al (2016) deden. Zij onderzochten de manier waarop journalisten uit verschillende Europese landen materiaal van sociale media verifiëren en daarnaast brengen ze ook in kaart hoe deze journalisten dit materiaal zien en benaderen. Daarnaast doen de journalisten in het onderzoek van Brandtzaeg et. al aanbevelingen voor hoe het verificatieproces beter kan. De vragen die in dit onderzoek worden beantwoord, zijn dan ook voor een deel rechtstreeks afgeleid van hun onderzoek, maar dan toegespitst op amateurbeeldmateriaal van sociale media. Zeker in crisissituaties is de informatie en het (beeld)materiaal dat op sociale media te vinden is voor veel journalisten inmiddels al een zeer belangrijke bron (Rauchfleisch 2017, p.1). Dat maakt het relevant om te onderzoeken of en hoe Nederlandse journalisten dit materiaal verifiëren. Ten eerste voor de journalisten zelf, maar ook voor de nieuwsconsument. Dit onderzoek wil aantonen hoe de verificatie van amateurbeeldmateriaal van sociale media bij nieuwsorganisaties in zijn werk gaat en dus kan de consument zich op basis daarvan ook afvragen hoe kritisch hij zelf moet kijken naar materiaal van amateurs dat door journalisten wordt gebruikt. Hiertoe is de volgende onderzoeksvraag gebruikt: Hoe verifiëren journalisten amateurbeeldmateriaal van sociale media? Het onderzoek is zowel met een kwalitatieve als een kwantitatieve methode uitgevoerd. Het kwalitatieve deel bestaat uit semi-gestructureerde interviews, die zich richten op het verificatieproces en de waarde die journalisten hechten aan dat proces. Er wordt gereconstrueerd of en hoe journalisten beelden van sociale media verifiëren, en hoe belangrijk zij verificatie in dit opzicht vinden. De vragen zijn grotendeels afgeleid van het onderzoek van Brandtzaeg et. al (2016, p. 327). De kwantitatieve gegevens komen voort uit een enquête en hier gaat het over de algemene houding van journalisten ten opzichte van amateurbeelden afkomstig van sociale media. Het geeft een beeld van de waarde die de journalisten aan amateurbeelden toekennen en hoe vaak zij deze gebruiken. De enquête werd voorafgaande aan het interview door de journalist ingevuld. De interviews vormen verreweg de belangrijkste bron van informatie waaruit de conclusies in dit onderzoek worden getrokken. De gegevens uit de enquête dienen vooral als nuttige ondersteunende achtergrondinformatie. Er zijn in dit onderzoek 12 journalisten geïnterviewd en geënquêteerd, werkzaam bij verschillende media. Uit de resultaten is naar voren gekomen dat de Nederlandse journalisten in dit onderzoek allemaal in meer of mindere mate gebruik maken van sociale media voor hun werk. Amateurbeeldmateriaal maakt daar een deel van uit. Zij gebruiken dit materiaal minder vaak dan materiaal van sociale media in het algemeen, maar toch zeker nog regelmatig. De verificatie van amateurbeeldmateriaal van sociale media is naar de mening van de respondenten essentieel en ook belangrijker dan de verificatie van ander materiaal. Dit komt vooral voort uit de angst dat dit beeldmateriaal gemanipuleerd kan worden. De angst voor manipulatie van het beeldmateriaal wordt door de respondenten in dit onderzoek breed gedeeld. Dit betekent niet dat de journalisten altijd overgaan tot de verificatie van het materiaal. Tijdsdruk is een aspect dat in dit geval vaak voorbij komt als verklaring. Journalisten willen iets graag brengen, en maken dan de afweging dat verificatie niet nodig is. Er wordt in zo’n geval dan vaak afgegaan op het eigen gevoel, een journalistieke ‘gut feeling’. In het verificatieproces maken de journalisten vooral gebruik van verificatiemethoden die als traditioneel kunnen worden gezien. Verificatietools die hiervoor beschikbaar zijn, vinden bij de journalisten in dit onderzoek amper aftrek. De respondenten deden wel aanbevelingen voor het ontwikkelen van tools, die er vooral op neerkwamen dat tools die de journalisten tijd en moeite besparen in het proces, gewenst zijn.","['Journalistiek', 'Verificatie', 'Brongebruik', 'Media', 'Amateurbeelden', 'Social media', 'Twitter', 'Foto', 'Video', 'Interviews']"

Capitalized Attention vs. Human Intention - Understanding the Implications ofObjectified Attention Capital in Digital Media,"Römer, Mathis","['Sleutels, J.J.M.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This essay examines the societal and psychological repercussions of technology and techniques commonly employed in digital media. It identifies the workings of human attention and its exploitation as a major gateway for external influence to undermine the authoritative and intentional use of digital media. The ability to attract human attention is central to the business models of the largest digital companies today. By attracting and redirecting human attention towards advertisement, collecting valuable data in the process, companies like Alphabet, Amazon or Facebook turn major parts of their profits. It is proposed that the capability to attract human attention as a resource is best approached by understanding it as a form of capital in the tradition of Pierre Bourdieu. It, therefore, differentiates between incorporated, institutionalized and objectified attention capital. Objectified attention capital is of special interest since it resembles the material means to attract attention, including the digital infrastructure, server farms, algorithms and social media platforms owned by large corporations. With this focus on attention, the interplay between the human mind and the technologies employed can be traced, revealing the structural undermining of human intention by technological and economic rationale. The reversal of the roles of consumer and media are then diagnosed, implying the exploitation of the consumer as an end to generate behavioral surplus data and profits, overruling the original intent of the consumer in the process. The effects of this reversal and subsequent loss of human control are then embedded in the works of Jürgen Habermas and his concept of colonization. It is demonstrated, how the functioning of objectified attention capital is colonizing ever new areas of everyday life, subsuming and assimilating it under its logic. Four major repercussions of this process are finally laid out: Firstly, the formalization and decline of public debate. Utilizing the Habermasian terminology of the public sphere (Habermas, 1962), detrimental effects of objectified attention capital on the public debate are identified including the fragmentation of knowledge, leading to ‘post-truth’ politics, as well as the commodification of public discourse that takes away its spontaneity and with it its emancipatory momentum. Secondly, this approach is extended and applied to the democratic process, where the amplification and encouragement of moral outrage on digital platforms by filter-mechanisms of objectified attention capital are demonstrated. Referencing the works of Jan-Werner Müller (2016) and James Williams (2018), the populist tendencies of the increasing moral outrage are traced. Thirdly, the biases in attentional big data are brought forth that discriminate against women and minorities, since the data sets employed in objectified attention capital are often skewed, reproducing one-sided world views. Finally, the loss of human attention is understood as a decrease in human autonomy, increasing the control of technology over the future of humanity. However, utilizing the analytical tool of attention capital, several areas where steps against this development can be undertaken are identified, focusing on the regulation of objectified attention capital and the democratizing potential of institutionalized and incorporated attention capital.","['Attention Economy', 'Digital Media', 'Capitalism', 'Technology', 'Human Mind']"
