Deze collectie heeft gedurende mijn onderzoek als basis gediend om de visuele kant te koppelen aan de theecultuur. Theebussen worden weinig genoemd in onderzoeken naar de zeventiende en achttiende eeuwse theecultuur waar de focus eerder op theeserviezen ligt. In dit onderzoek worden de stijl ontwikkelingen van de theebus gekoppeld aan de theecultuur en de groei van de interesse in Aziatische producten. Deze producten werden door de Vereenigd Oost-Indische Compagnie naar de Republiek gebracht. Één van de belangrijkste producten was thee en dit, samen met de groeiende interesse in Chinees en Aziatisch aardewerk uit zich in de stijlontwikkeling van de theebus. Niet alleen een gebruiksobject, maar ook uiterst verzamelbaar. Pottenbakkers en zilversmeden droegen met hun eigen vervaardigingen hier aan bij. Hiermee voldeden zij aan de smaak van de elite. De gebruiksobjecten werden vervaardigd met een decoratief doeleinde en was op deze manier een theebus zonder gebruiksnut. Het nut van het tentoonstellen van theebussen op een schouw en het nuttigen van thee is dat het beiden een statussymbool is voor welvaart en kennis.","['tea', 'teaculture', 'thee', 'theecultuur', 'theebussen', 'caddies']"

A Transformation in the Shadows: The American Intelligence Community and the Indonesian War of Independence (1945-1949),"Dood, Thijs de","['Brocades Zaalberg, T.W.', 'Huff, G.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Indonesian War of Independence (1945-1949) has long been overlooked in large parts of international historiography, which is a shame. The war, which saw the nationalist Indonesian Republic prevail over its Indonesian competitors for national sovereignty and the Dutch, who were intent on re-establishing their colonial presence in the archipelago, took place on the intersection of the twentieth century's most significant themes, such as World War II, the Cold War and decolonisation. With the archipelago's future at stake, including its population of nearly seventy million inhabitants in 1945 and its large reserves of strategic resources, the conflict was pushed to the top of the international diplomatic agenda with a central role for the United States. According to the existing historiography, the US' attitude towards the conflict was relatively passive and reactive, while its policy was predominantly informed and executed through formal diplomacy. This seems out of character for the United States, given its WWII intelligence achievements and Cold War reputation for covert action, and raises the question if the historiography on the Indonesian War of Independence suffers from a 'missing dimension'. This thesis aims to explore and explain the role of the American intelligence community in shaping the American information position and policy on the Indonesian question, based on a wide variety of secondary literature and primary sources from American and Dutch collections and archives. Due to its classified nature, much of the intelligence-related archival material from this period was only declassified from the 1990s onwards, allowing for a reassessment of the major diplomatic histories on the conflict primarily written between 1960 and 1985. After charting the US intelligence presence and capabilities in Indonesia from 1945 to 1949, considering the relevant organisations for both human intelligence (HUMINT) and signals intelligence (SIGINT), it will be assessed how effectively intelligence was integrated into the State Department's foreign policy formulation process. This assessment will be made based on the intelligence cycle framework, distinguishing between the stages of planning and direction, collection, analysis, processing and dissemination. The story of American intelligence in the Indonesian War of Independence is also the story of the radical transformation the American intelligence community underwent in the years immediately following World War II, as the haphazardly created wartime intelligence apparatus was laboriously adapted into the country's first foreign intelligence apparatus in peacetime. Over a period of several years and via various short-lived interim agencies such as the Strategic Services Unit (SSU) and the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), the wartime Office of Strategic Services Unit (OSS) finally evolved into the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Throughout the Indonesian War of Independence, signals intelligence would remain a military affair in the hands of the Army Security Agency (ASA) and the Navy's OP-20-G. However, these forebears to the National Security Agency (NSA) went through a tumultuous period as well. Fearing competition in their foreign reporting privileges, State Department officials generally resisted the idea of intelligence gathering in peacetime. The strained 1 relationship with the upcoming intelligence community in which this resistance resulted will also form a central theme throughout this thesis. Although the lack of institutional continuity, absence of a clear mandate, continuous shortages of capacity and assets and the novelty of peacetime intelligence to policymakers generally prevented the American intelligence organisations from having a radical impact on the country's course, the story of American intelligence in the Indonesian War of Independence adds an intriguing perspective to the historiography on this complex and multi-layered conflict. In addition, the events of the Indonesian War of Independence proved to be one of the early American intelligence community's formative experiences, which were crucial in laying the foundations for the organisations that would gain notoriety in the Cold War soon afterwards.","['the Netherlands', 'United States', 'Indonesian Republic', 'Indonesian Independence', 'Intelligence', 'Diplomacy', 'United Nations', 'Central Intelligence Agency', 'CIA', 'Office of Strategic Services', 'OSS', 'Strategic Services Unit', 'SSU', 'State Department', 'Indonesian War of Independence', 'Intelligence Studies', 'Intelligence Cycle', 'OP20G', 'Army Security Agency', 'ASA', 'human intelligence', 'signals intelligence']"

Female Cultural and Gender roles in the East African Indian Diaspora,"Hirani Harji, Yaska Sahara",['David Henley'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,South and Southeast Asian Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Diaspora is an interesting, unique ,and widespread phenomenon, always bringing into question ideas of culture, identity and belonging. The Indian Diaspora is one of the largest in the world, and has been extensively researched. However, in both daily conversation and in academic literature, there seems to be a surprising relative lack of knowledge on the Indian Diaspora of East Africa, this is bewildering given its intrigue and importance in the region. Equally under emphasised are the cultural roles and experiences of women, often seen as symbols and carriers of culture; through dress, family making, cooking, ideas of honour and more. Diasporas often have a tendency towards remaining conservative, while the homeland often evolves, as a way to hold on to tradition and identity. This has changed in recent decades, either in the direction of new more modern ideas or blended identities with an even further drive to traditionalism by the contemporary generation. These various trajectories will be included in this paper.","['Diaspora', 'Indian Diaspora', 'East African', 'Migration', 'Gender and Culture']"

The Interplay of Architecture and Elements of Design at the Museum of Memory and Human Rights: Their Impact on Visitors' Experience of Memory Reparation,"Mejía, Michelle","['Lauritano, S.M']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Subsequent to Allende’s death, Augusto Pinochet lead a military dictatorship, and political violence in Chile resulted in “more than 3,000 killed, 30,000 tortured, and 80,000 incarcerated.” The 1973-1990 coup d’état transformed Chilean democracy into an atrocious dictatorship. In post- conflict periods of the 19th and early 20th centuries, political reconciliation within the country depended on resistance to impunity, following a quest for justice in the name of social peace and governability. This Chilean approach to political reconciliation promoted a multiparty system spanning the political spectrum, enforcing the participation of conservatives, communists and socialists. The Museum of Memory and Human Rights was created to make known the systematic human rights violations by the Chilean state, and to promote ethical reflection about memory and human rights so that ‘Never Again’ will these events that attack human dignity be repeated. In order to unveil visitor’s experience of memory reparation at the MMHR, this research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the interplay of the architectural elements of design at the MMHR. The interaction of elements at the MMHR: its form, extensive use of glass, structural systems, design of the exhibition allowing for the inclusion of different modes of display of multimedia within the exhibit, will bring forth how their combination elicits a regime of memory experience and remembrance on museum visitors.","['museum experience', 'museum architecture', 'museum studies', 'memory studies', 'memory reparation']"

Circular Signification and the Volatile Godzilla: The Transmogrification of a Monster Icon (1954-),"Haar, Philip",['Steven Lauritano'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis presents the icon of Godzilla as a case study in how meaning becomes ‘volatilized’ by repetition. Given the repetitive nature of the Godzilla franchise (36 films and counting) the monster became a ‘floating signifier’; he can mediate a variety of interpretations within his representation, a compounding of signification that makes the Godzilla icon somewhat illegible. Godzilla (1954) being the ‘the primary text’ was a mediation of trauma Japan suffered from the war, displaying previously suppressed perspectives. The film became a global success, which elicited repetition. The property remained Japanese and is considered an exercise of soft-power for Japanese culture, but its transformation into a Godzilla-themed spectacle eroded the signification that spawned the icon which became self-referential for its audience. What sets the original and its sequels apart was its inception: in 1954 the production presented a narrative based on shared experiences. In 2016 came a Godzilla-film with similar aspirations, a case of ‘circular signification’ (returning to meaning despite volatilization). How does Godzilla as a volatile icon engage in circular signification and why is this exceptional?","['Godzilla', 'icon', 'volatilization', 'simulacrum', 'floating signifier', '(circular) signification', 'national trauma']"

Feminist Epistemology and the Heart-Mind: A Constructive Comparative Project,"Heil, Cecilia",['Prof. Dr. Douglas Berger'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This gendered character of knowing is extremely limiting and prescriptive, leading to toxic reproductions of gender-stereotypes and a narrow selection of ‘appropriate’ knowledge-practices. Additionally, it makes us all, men and women, miss out on certain paths to knowledge and leads to an imbalanced community of knowers, favoring the rational approach to research and associating kinds of intellectual work with men and marginalizing kinds of research and knowledge that are understood as ‘female’. Therefore, I believe, we are in need of a new framework of knowing that: a) does not ascribe gender to any way of knowing, b) does not propagate a male-female dichotomy and hierarchy, c) includes all genders in all operations and modes of knowledge and can be used by all genders and d) allows for non-toxic, fluid and free manifestations of gender based on epistemological practices. How can we construct such a new and non-gendered framework of knowledge? After explaining the problem and some core issues in the first chapter, the second chapter will introduce the relevant work done in the field of modern feminist epistemology. Its naturalized branch will especially help us construct a new knowledge-framework. In the third chapter, we will explain the Confucian concept of the ‘heart-mind’ and its relevance for this new framework of knowing, before fleshing out this framework in more detail in the final chapter. With a constructive comparative approach and a creative handling of the concepts we will ground our framework in naturalized feminist epistemology and employ the Confucian ‘heart-mind’ as a personal and practical locus of non-gendered knowing that addresses all the criteria (a-d) of our solution above.","['Confucian Philosophy', 'Comparative Philosophy', 'Feminist Epistemology', 'the Heart-Mind', 'non-gendered knowing']"

In current times, the world is connected more than ever especially in regards to agricultural production such as banana production. In that way, for consumers, it is essential to be aware of their role as buyer and consumer and the impact their behaviour may have on nature and society. Especially, with the pressuring foreign demand for bananas which increased in the past years substantially. They must also understand how this impacts the sustainability of the banana production and its environmental consequences on the labour conditions of banana workers. In that way, this thesis will explore the Fairtrade banana production in Ecuadorian province of El Oro, by putting the fairness in Fairtrade into question. Additionally, small farmers from the Global South are responsible for at best 70 percent of the global food supply production, while at the same time they depend on the trade of their agricultural products as a source of income. Precisely, the province El Oro represents one of the three principal export-producers in the nation, containing the highest number of producers, and by being involved with Fairtrade International, this makes the El Oro banana production an intriguing case study.","['Theory of Change', 'sustainability', 'Fairtrade Movement', 'El Oro Fairtrade banana production', 'labour conditions of banana workers', 'Estrategía ecuatoriana de Comercio Justo 2014-2017']"

Burger'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Het doel van dit onderzoek is om de rolopvattingen te achterhalen van internationale factcheckers, aangesloten bij het International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: ‘Welke rolopvattingen hebben internationale factcheckers, aangesloten bij het International Fact-Checking Network?’ Om antwoord te kunnen geven op de onderzoeksvraag zijn er 14 semigestructureerde interviews afgenomen bij internationale factcheckers uit verschillende landen over de hele wereld. Gedurende deze interviews zijn de respondenten bevraagd over hun taakomschrijvingen en rolopvattingen tijdens hun werk voor verschillende soorten factcheckorganisaties, zoals NGO’s, universiteiten en factcheck-afdelingen van gevestigde nieuwsorganisaties. De resultaten tonen aan dat factcheckers wereldwijd een maatschappelijke functie dragen, naast hun primaire taak van informeren en feiten presenteren. Die maatschappelijke functie kan bestaan uit rollen als ‘schadebeperker’ door schadelijke onderwerpen te signaleren, als ‘scheidsrechter’ door het publiek te onderwijzen en het publieke personen verantwoordelijk te houden, als vorm van accountability-journalistiek en als ‘expertjager’, door de juiste experts in een bepaald vakgebied te vinden. De resultaten van dit onderzoek zijn vergeleken met de rolopvattingen van journalist, activist en expert volgens een voorgaande studie van Graves & Cherubini (2016). Uit de antwoorden van de respondenten bleek dat de meeste factcheckers zich identificeren met de rol van journalist, gevolgd door de rol van activist. Factcheckers identificeren zich het minst met de rol van expert. De uitdagingen van factcheckers verschillen per organisatie en per land. Tijdgebrek, geloofsovertuigingen en vakjargon zijn voorbeelden van dergelijke uitdagingen. De respondenten beschouwen transparantie van bronnen en methodologische transparantie als centrale journalistieke normen. Op basis van de resultaten van dit onderzoek zijn suggesties voor vervolgonderzoek geformuleerd, bijvoorbeeld naar de rolopvattingen van Scandinavische of Aziatische factcheckers en onderzoek naar de rolopvattingen van factcheckers wereldwijd met behulp van kwantitatieve onderzoeksmethoden.","['factchecken', 'rolopvattingen', 'International Fact-Checking Network', 'factcheckorganisaties']"

Designing Freedom: Examining the transition from rural to urban from the perspective of the capability approach,"Wulffelé, Jan","['Meijers, T.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"“The future of the world’s population is urban.”1 People move to the city for opportunities, money and a better life. When we look at this transition from a freedom perspective, instead of the common resource or utility views, you could question whether the city will always provide this better life. Do urban environments provide the freedoms we value, better than rural environments? In this thesis I claim that certain freedoms, present in rural environments, actually get reduced when people move to the city, and that the urban spatial environment is a crucial factor in this. I will introduce Amartya Sen’s capability approach to elaborate on the importance of capabilities, compared to other normative indicators of human flourishing. Sen’s capability approach does not focus on resources or outcomes, but on the process whereby people flourish; the freedom people have to do and to be as they have reason to value. These substantive freedoms are divided by Sen in a freedom concerned with people’s wellbeing (reflecting capabilities) and a freedom concerned with people’s agency. This distinction is particularly relevant when we consider spatial environments. Where wellbeing freedom deals with the different opportunities open to people, agency freedom concerns the freedom people have to effectively shape and choose their own. By looking at concrete cases, I show that certain freedoms, while present in rural environments, are reduced by the spatial design of our cities, after which I present a number of inspirational design cases which are able to address these losses. I conclude by arguing that, in designing our cities, there is reason to pay more attention to the rural valuing of freedom, both in providing alternative options for people to achieve wellbeing, and in providing space for people to exercise agency in order to conceive a wider range of valuable goals.","['Wellbeing', 'Agency', 'Freedom', 'Capability Approach', 'Freedom Sensitive Design']"

In 1943 he would join Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National Army before returning to Malaya in 1948 where he became involved in the Anti-British League, the University Socialist Club and the founding of the People's Action Party. He was detained for a second time between 1956-59 and after his release went on to work within the PAP government on issues of economic development, before leaving politics to turn to the study of Law. After his banishment from Singapore in 1963, he went on to support Malaysia through the Malaysian Afro-Asian Peoples’ Solidarity Organisation. Puthucheary was an anti-colonialist, a socialist, a trade unionist, an economist, an intellectual and a figure who was linked to global anti-colonial networks. Drawing upon a greater focus on global networks of decolonisation and the intellectual history of decolonisation, this thesis uses Puthucheary's political and intellectual trajectory as a lens through which to highlight the more complex ways in which anti-colonialism was being thought out in Malaya. In particular it highlights Puthucheary, and others around him, at the intersection of the rise of Afro-Asianism and of debates on the national question in Malaya which drew upon broader communist and socialist thought. Here questions of decolonisation intersected with questions of class, communalism and economic development. This thesis goes on to highlight how debates on the national question came to shape engagement with Afro-Asian networks.","['James Puthucheary', 'the national question', 'Afro-Asianism', 'Malaya', 'decolonisation']"
The long and winding road to a domestic consensus on enlargement? Parliamentary positions and framing on EU enlargement in the Netherlands between 2004 and 2020,"Audenaerde, Joël",['Dr M Broad'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,European Politics and Society: Vaclav Havel Joint Master Programme,Master thesis,en,"In which ways has EU enlargement been framed in national parliamentary debates? And what positions do actors take on enlargement? And finally, do partisan dynamics explain these positions and frames? This thesis provides an assessment of the debate on enlargement in the Dutch national parliament between 2004 and 2020. It aims to build upon research on the nationalisation of the enlargement policy. Are the positions of national governments similar to those of parliamentary actors? Empirically, this thesis shows that enlargement in debates has lost salience over time and that mostly positions have become more negative. In terms of framing, the debates in the Netherlands are characterised by a strong focus on pragmatic frames. Both these positions can be explained by strategical considerations; a party in government tends to emphasise pragmatic frames more so. Moreover, the cultural axis of partisan dynamics explains that more conservative parties are generally more critical of enlargement.","['Enlargement', 'national parliaments', 'politicisation', 'salience', 'party politcs']"

President Moon Jae-in has spent a considerable amount of political capital on prosecution reform (kŏmch'al kaehyŏk) since his election in 2017, and bitter battles on multiple fronts erupted over the president’s drive to remove power from the prosecution and shift it to different institutions. The cornerstone of these reforms finally passed the legislature in 2020 after decades of effort from civic groups and politicians. High-profile debates over the future of the prosecution elevated former Prosecutor General Yoon Seok-youl to a top presidential contender, despite never having held elected office. This thesis takes the following as its central question – why has prosecution reform become associated with the South Korean democratization and the political fault lines that emerged in its wake? It is an attempt to interrogate the motivations behind this quest for reform and situate it as part of a political and historical era – that is, the continued and contentious legacy of democratization and the transition to a more open civil society in the 1980s and 1990. This investigation will begin with a summary and analysis of the particular roles and responsibilities of the South Korean prosecution, as well as a brief overview of some of the existing literature. The first chapter will cover the prosecution’s history under Japanese rule, the American occupation, and the South Korean governments that followed the end of American rule in 1948. The institution’s historical formation is important to understanding the way the prosecution has been viewed by reformers in more recent years. The second chapter concerns the methods by which the prosecution was deployed during authoritarian rule, conflicts between the prosecution and legal activist groups, and the institutional continuity the prosecutor’s office displayed after the transition to democracy in 1987. The third chapter explores the ways through which the issue of prosecutorial reform has been framed, debated, in the context of changes in South Korean governance and society from the 1990s onward. The final chapter briefly discusses the successful implementation of reforms under the Moon Jae-in administration. This research draws on primary sources including newspaper archives from databases such as Naver News Library and the Korea Integrated Newspaper Database System, government and court case records, and documents from the civic organizations that first proposed sweeping changes to the country’s prosecution. This thesis is part history and part histography, as it charts the way the prosecution’s past has been interpreted to reorder its present powers. Ultimately, it is my hope that this investigation will shed a light on how an issue that has an enduring impact on modern South Korean politics came to be theorized and discussed as representing an unfinished legacy of democratization.","['Prosecution reform', 'South Korea', 'legal studies', 'judicial reform', 'East Asian studies', 'democratization', 'democracy', 'prosecution', 'law']"
Critical pedagogy revisited: Exploring opportunities for Dutch civic education in museums,"Don, Tessa",['Karin de Wild'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"In a globalizing world, the need for intercultural connection rapidly increases. The Dutch government responds to this need by giving civic education a more prominent position in primary and secondary education. Dutch civic education focuses on fostering social cohesion and creating active citizenship. This research explores the extent to which museums, as important educational institutions, could contribute to these efforts. It aims to find out if and how critical pedagogy could contribute to civic education in museums. In the existing literature, there is no consensus about the usefulness of this theory. It is questioned in terms of its distinctiveness, applicability, usefulness in times of globalization and activistic character. In order to contribute to this debate, a new theoretical framework is set out by integrating Freire’s notion of critical pedagogy with museological observations about this theory. This framework is then used as a lens through which the educational program Achter het Goud of the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam is critically analyzed. The research concludes that the new critical pedagogy framework helps students to become aware of various cultures, critically assess their position in the cultural stratification, and understand how cultural power relations are maintained, both in and outside the museum. Moreover, it helps students to become active citizens who improve society in terms in equality and justice. Thereby, when properly applied in museum education, critical pedagogy can foster the main aims of Dutch civic education by stimulating both social cohesion and active participation among students.",

Long Live the Patriarchy? A Critical Discourse Analysis of the Relationship between Gender and Legitimacy in the Recruitment of Women by ISIS,"Termeer, Agnes","['Duyvesteyn, Isabelle']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Although jihadist organisations envisage a society segregated by roles between the sexes, they increasingly turn to women in pursuit of their goals. This is a double-edged sword for jihadist organisations: while female recruits increase the pool of followers, the discrepancy between their patriarchal ideology and women’s enlistment may have implications for their legitimacy. Whereas explanations have been offered as to how jihadists resort to patriarchal gender beliefs to legitimise their exclusion of women, questions remain regarding how jihadist groups use gender to legitimise their inclusion of women. Increased understanding of this gender component may yield insight into the organisational structure of jihadist organisations and their future direction regarding female recruits. Exploring the case of ISIS, this thesis analyses the extent to which the group adopted a gender perspective in legitimising its recruitment of women between 2015 and 2017. By conducting a critical discourse analysis, three gendered narratives are identified that ISIS employed in justifying its recruitment of women, depicting women as builders of the Ummah, as representatives of Islam and as guardians of the Caliphate. Rather than women challenging its patriarchal hegemony, the narratives illustrate how ISIS used this structure to create a set of gendered incentives and thereby attributed women (violent) agency.","['Terrorism', 'Women', 'Recruitment', 'Legitimacy', 'Gender', 'Islamic State', 'Jihadist organisations']"

From the Twelfth Dynasty onwards, this delineation of the Egyptian territory materializes itself in the solid man-made structures, which physically set the frontiers in the south and the north-east of the country. There have been little scholarly attempts, however, to investigate the borderlands in the region located immediately to the west of Nile Valley, in the area today broadly defined as the Western (or Libyan) Desert.The main aim of this thesis, therefore, is to reconstruct the functional parameter of the governing agents in Dakhla Oasis - the local governors and the military institution - so that the Middle Kingdom Western frontier could be defined within its performative framework.

Quantifying the left; examining the development of socialist thought inside the Korean colonial magazine Kaebyok,"Pol, Aron van de","['De Ceuster, K.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Koreastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This quantitative study was conducted to tackle the absence of quantitative research into socialist thought within nationalist press in the 1920s. Leftist nationalist thought has been marginalised ever since the U.S. occupation of the Southern regions of the Korean Peninsula. The repression of leftist thought that the U.S. instigated continued in the South Korean state in the spirit of the Cold War and was consequently ignored by many scholars of Korea. It was after bans on leftist literature were lifted in 1988 that it sparked renewed interest by scholars. While recently more works surrounding leftist culture have been produced, studies examining the growth of socialism as political thought within the 1920s remain scarce. The development of nationalist groups in this period is important as here lie the foundations for leftist ideologies that played a major role in the division of the Korean Peninsula. Furthermore, leftist culture still remains stigmatised within South Korea today and the importance of it has yet to be fully recognised. During the first ten years of the colonisation of the Korean Peninsula (1910-1945) the Korean populace dealt with harsh repression of nationalist sentiment. After the nationalist uprisings on March 1st 1919, it became clear to the Japanese that change was needed. This coincided with the more liberal Taisho era in Japan proper and prompted a change of leadership in the colony. With the arrival of governor-general Saitō Makoto, a more liberal period in the colony was ushered in and among many changes, indigenous press was allowed under watch of colonial government. Immediately after the allowance of press, newspapers and monthly magazines produced by Koreans developed rapidly. It was within this colonial setting that a unique public sphere emerged in which, for a brief period, critical dialogue between nationalist and the colonial government was able to occur. Nationalists quickly made use of this newfound freedom. Two nationalist ideologies began playing a major role within this public sphere: cultural nationalists and socialists. Cultural nationalists advocated the construction of a new culture, which was the necessary basis for an independent Korean nation. They favoured long-term cultural ventures that would aid with the creation of a new culture and prepare Koreans for becoming independent. In contrast, socialists proposed other ideas for the way to independence in the form of Marxist ideas, often on a short term basis. Socialist authors took a critical stance towards cultural nationalists, they criticised the elitist nature of their plans and in later years even accused them of accommodationism. While dialogue between these nationalist groups occurred throughout much of the press, the dialogue within the monthly magazine Kaebyŏk (開闢) is of interest. Kaebyŏk became the most prominent and longest running magazine of the 1920s. Publishing a total of 2447 articles from its inception in 1920 until its ban by the colonial government in 1926, Kaebyŏk has often designated as the centre for cultural nationalist thought, and while authors have highlighted that socialist published within Kaebyŏk too, there are often conflicting claims as to how significant it was. This leaves a gap in our understanding of the importance of socialism within Kaebyŏk. New developments into computational approaches for the humanities expanded and became known collectively as the ‘Digital Humanities’. Approaches within this subfield offer new opportunities that were previously unachievable; through the use of computational approaches, a distant reading of large numbers of texts is possible within a small amount of time. Scholars have already begun to tap into the possibilities that this brings, but most research that is being done focuses on western historical documents and corpuses. This is due to two reasons: the availability of digitised western texts greatly outweighs counterparts and many of the tools available to conduct such research are based on western languages (mostly English). Research into other fields such as Korean studies is rising, yet groundwork for approaches easily applicable to western texts is still being laid by DH scholars. Scholars engaging in the question of the development of socialism in the 1920s have generally done so through qualitative research, bringing into focus the contents of the text. While this provides important insights into the texts and ideologies itself, it offers limited understanding of the larger trends that occurred within Kaebyŏk and the growth of socialist thought. Through the use of the aforementioned new computational approaches, this study aims to fill this gap by answering the question: How did the numerical volume of socialist publications within Kaebyŏk develop quantitively throughout its lifetime? By reducing the development of socialist thought to a numerical approach, we put in focus the larger trends of this development, but through doing so forfeit gaining new insights into the qualitative content of the texts. To achieve this, the study makes use of a method called topic modelling, which tries to disseminate ‘topics’ from a set of documents. These ‘topics’ show as result a word cluster that needs interpretation of a human actor. To achieve this on Kaebyŏk, we will make us of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm in conjunction with gibbs sampling. By examining the produced topics and linking these to what is known about both socialism and cultural nationals articles can be tagged. A total of two topics that represent cultural nationalist ideology were found, and three that represent socialist ideology. We then examined the composition of articles and tagged these based on the found topics to produce a bar chart showing the amount of socialist and cultural nationalist articles per published issue of Kaebyŏk. The findings of this study show the prominence of socialist articles within Kaebyŏk. With initial growth in December 1922 and a small decline, we can see a resurgence of socialist articles in September 1923, whereafter they become the most present ideology when compared to cultural nationalism. Socialist articles remained present in significant numbers until the very last publication of Kaebyŏk in August 1926. Cultural nationalist articles declined sharply after September 1923, and only occasionally appeared in small numbers. This study confirms assertions by qualitative studies from Robinson (1988) that socialist influence was noticeable and Park (2015) that socialist intellectuals used Kaebyŏk as an outlet too. However, this study breaks from the expected pattern of the decline of socialist articles after the enactment of the peace preservation law and prohibition of publication for two months. None of these measures seem to have had significant effect on the amount of publications of socialist articles when compared to the period between September 1923 and the enactment of the peace preservation law. This provides evidence for the claim that the peace preservation law only became actively enforced after 1927. Additionally this study adds to the field of digital humanities by showing the possibility of using the KoNLPy package, alongside manual additions to stop-word lists, to gain useable data from older Korean texts. Furthermore, it employed the PyLDAvis package to examine the produced topic model in a more intuitive manner than the command line. It also allows for easy distribution of the results. Lastly, this thesis aims to show the possibilities that lie within cooperation between quantitive studies and qualitative studies. Without the previously conducted close readings and studies produced through this, this research would have been impossible.","['Kaebyŏk', 'Korea', 'Digital Humanties']"

How can a fear chance at education also be given to visually challenged students from poverty?,"Ramlochan Tewarie, Vaishnavi","['Kanungo, P.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,South and Southeast Asian Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"According to the 2001 Census, almost half of all persons with disabilities are literate and visually disabled. It is when seeing this relatively large number I wondered if visually impaired children from poverty get an equal chance at education in India. The reason chosen for this subject is empathy and personal interest. I work at Voorall, a foundation in The Hague that stands up for the interests of disabled people. Children are the future of the world and education is something that should be invested in because knowledge is relevant for one’s development. Empowerment of visually disabled people from a poor environment is of great importance, because all children deserve a fair and equal chance in education. This makes it essential that education should be inclusive. Firstly, the methodology will be explained. For this research it was important to do both desk research as well as qualitative research. For the desk research primary as well as secondary sources have been used. The qualitative research has been done in the form of a questionnaire with 9 visually impaired students from India that are from a poor background. The hypothesis is that although the government, NGO’s and institutions are involved in inclusive education, visually challenged school children from poverty have less chance on a good education. Therefore, the main question for this thesis is: How can a fear chance at education also be given to visually challenged students from poverty? Besides the fact that this question will be theoretically approached, I will also give advice with help of the read theories. Some questions need to be answered to form the right advice for the main question. Hence, the sub questions are: What are the policies on inclusiveness and disability by the state?, Which parties and NGO’s are involved in getting poor students an education?, How do schools approach a visual impairment?, How can the state of India and NGO’s realize inclusivity in education amongst the visually challenged underprivileged? and How do visually impaired students experience inclusive education?. For the latter the results of the questionnaire are most useful. In the conclusion a piece of advice will be given on how India can improve inclusive education based on the results of the research questions and questionnaire.","['equality', 'education', 'visually impaired', 'visually challenged', 'students', 'poverty']"

The main purpose of this project is to put this hypothesis to the test by locating and exploring femininity in early Indonesia, as it is the heartland of the cultural area in question. We should be able to see some of the social norms and convictions of the time reflected in works of art intended for a broad audience. In order to affirm or dispute the claim that women and men were considered equal in pre-modern Indonesia, I will be looking at the reliefs of Borobudur. Interestingly, the stories taken from Buddhist texts are not illustrated word for word, but have been infused with local meanings. Images of women and the narratives behind them could help us understand what social patterns femininity was associated with at the time. A smart and timely reference to the historical data available can be used to interpret and supplement the findings. At the end of my journey, I would be able to answer to what extent have expectations of normative social behavior affected the visual depictions of women. Subsequently, it will be possible to determine what aspects of femininity are exclusive to Indonesia and enrich our understanding of its pre-modernity.",

Through their examples, this thesis wants to show that Chinese designers and brands constitute a major springboard for establishing a global model in sustainable fashion. Simultaneously, it seeks to dismantle the widespread stereotypes portraying Chinese fashion designers and brands as mere copycats of Western trends, as well as stereotypes describing Chinese fashion as a product of fast fashion. The literature review first explores the concept of ‘fashion’, and then delves into the different models fashion can take, namely fast fashion, sustainable fashion and luxury fashion. Finally, it assesses the degree of sustainable awareness in China, as well as highlights the crucial role of Chinese fashion designers and brands on the global scene. Then, the analysis of Ma Ke and ICICLE demonstrates that Chinese designers and brands have already been actively working towards embracing sustainability since the late 1990’s, and have further taken their designs to Paris as a way to successfully display their designs and practices. Nevertheless, despite similar visions of fashion and approaches to the environment, designer Ma Ke and brand ICICLE carry different purposes and philosophies.","['Chinese fashion designers', 'sustainable fashion', 'fashion consumption', 'fast-fashion', 'green-washing', 'dismantling stereotypes', 'sustainable and cultural practices']"

Desde el principio del siglo XX, diversos autores mapuches han producido un levantamiento literario debido al hueco que existe entre la historia enseñada en la escuela sobre tal pueblo y la tradición oral producido en el entorno familiar mapuche. La relación conflictiva entre el estado chileno y los mapuches y la lógica eurocentrista dentro del cual está producido el entorno escolar en Chile han causado que el currículo nacional chileno refleja narrativas históricas hegemónicas.

A comparison study on how the urban environment relates to the mental well-being of different cultural groups in the Netherlands,"Klaver, Lieve","['Mark Mulder', 'Henriët van Middendorp']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Urbanization is seen as one of the leading changes related to health. This is, among other things, due to increased densities of populations and buildings. This results in increased light, air and noise pollution and the decrease of green spaces. Living in urbanized areas has been negatively associated with mental health in previous studies. Furthermore literature research found that highly urbanized areas are more segregated and have a higher percentage of non-native citizens. Non-western immigrants in the Netherlands have found to have more mental health problems than Dutch citizens. Issues about mental well-being in the multicultural urban environment are complex and therefore demands for an interdisciplinary approach. This study aims to give a multidisciplinary insight on mental health by researching the urban environment and mental health among different cultural groups. Urban environment is measured through satisfaction as well as residential density and land-use mix. With the use of an online survey this study gathered data of 34 Dutch, Turkish, Moroccan and Surinamese citizens that live in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague to make comparisons between the groups and cities. Analyses on a cross-sectional questionnaire study provided significant evidence that increased land-use mix and density of facilities moderately relates to a higher satisfaction of the environment. No evidence was found that cultural background, cultural identity or city of residence relates to mental well-being and satisfaction of the urban environment. The research can also not conclude a relationship between residential density and satisfaction or mental well-being. Information from this research provides an additional perspective for urban planners to take in regard the impact of the urban environment on health. For future research we suggest to study the relationship between the urban environment and mental well-being through a longitudinal study and advise a further focus on cultural identity in contemporary cities.","['Urban environment', 'mental well-being', 'the multicultural city', 'urbanization']"

Issues in the Representation of Tone in Element Theory,"Hugte, Thom van",['Dr. Bert Botma'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In order to formally explain consonant-tone interactions in Element Theory, it has been assumed for many years that tone can be represented on the segmental tier with the elements |H| and |L|. However, this assumption has never been fully developed within Element Theory. When one attempts to represent complex tonal inventories, it immediately becomes apparent that there are fundamental representational issues. For example, it is unclear how to generate more than two tonal contrasts or how to represent contour tones on short vowels. In this thesis, I consider how these issues could be solved while maintaining Element Theory’s central principles. The two most crucial ideas developed in this thesis are that tone needs to be represented by unheaded elements and that information on the tonal tier is visible during phonetic implementation. With these assumptions, |H| and |L| can freely appear within the same elemental expression and tones do not necessarily need to be specified at the segmental level.

The Curious Case of Casa do Fernandez: Challenges of Heritage Management in Nigeria,"Zeijl, Femke van","['Fatah-Black, K.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Casa do Fernandez or Ilojo Bar was a National Monument in the heart of Lagos Island, Nigeria. It was built by the returnees who came back from Brazil to Africa, the homeland that the Transatlantic Slave Trade had taken their forefathers away from. Although it was a National Monument and should have been protected under Nigerian heritage law, it was illegally demolished on 11 September 2016. How could this prime example of Brazilian-style architecture have been destroyed in broad daylight? This thesis uses Casa do Fernandez as a case study to explore the challenges of preserving built heritage in Nigeria. In the process, it tries to figure out why there is so little knowledge about the history of a building declared a National Monument over sixty years ago. The story of the monument turns out to be different than always assumed. After researching the building’s history, the focus is turned to heritage: the way the present interacts with the past. Could the way Casa do Fernandez has been defined as heritage have something to do with its sad end? The thesis argues that the rigid definition of Casa do Fernandez as strictly Afro-Brazilian heritage detached the site of its cultural meaning to other groups in society and sowed the seeds of the eventual demise of the National Monument. It is a plea for a wider and more inclusive interpretation of this heritage-site in particular and of heritage in general.","['history', 'heritage', 'Nigeria', 'monuments', 'returnees', 'Lagos', 'Brazil', 'Galicia', 'Portugal', 'Transatlantic slave trade']"

This thesis analyzes the development of Dutch homonationalism from 1990-2002. It finds that the origins and development of homonationalism are rarely discussed. Only research by Bram Mellink focused on the origins of Dutch homonationalism between 1980 and 1990. By analyzing the selected period, this research tries to bridge the gap between the origins of Dutch homonationalism and the full fledged Dutch homonationalism that can be found in the 21st century. It applies a framework that is grounded in established theories and understandings of homonationalism, to reflect on the theoretical foundations of homonationalism and their historical applicability. This paper finds that utilizing homonationalism and its manifestations as they were defined by Puar is in fact ahistorical. Consequently, under the chosen theoretical framework homonationalism is rarely found. Therefore, this research identifies a developing form of homonationalism: proto-homonationalism. To support further research, it establishes a new framework to analyze this proto-homonationalism. The findings of this research thus establish the weaknesses of applying homonationalist theory to historical periods and provide an alternative that allows for a deeper theoretical as well as historical understanding of homonationalism throughout time.","['Homonationalism', 'LBGTQ rights', 'emancipation', 'discrimination', 'The Netherlands']"

Oil Endowment as a Facilitator to Chávez's Ascension to Power,"Gomes Ferreira, Verónica",['Dr Edmund Amann'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"How is Venezuela’s oil dependency associated with the authoritarian rise of Hugo Chávez Frías? This question can be addressed in three varying pathways; short, medium and long-term explanations. This paper attempts to construct profound insights into the rise of Chávez as a populist competitive authoritarian leader. In order to comprehend the popularity of a leader with authoritarian characteristics, the political and socio-economic context must be understood. Chávez’s rise is often seen as a consequence of the collapse of the Punto Fijo system. However, this only provides medium-term explanations. Instead, it should be asked why the collapse of puntofijismo entail the rise of authoritarianism. To answer this question, this thesis commences its research by exploring the foundations of the pact of Punto Fijo. It finds that Venezuela did not consolidate its democracy and, as a consequence, during social upheaval, its democratic institutions withered when confronted with the rise of authoritarianism. Furthermore, it explores the social grievances that led to Chávez’s rise and analyzes the role of petroleum in his ascension to power. The findings conclude that the pact of Punto Fijo, which prevailed for 40 years, prolonged the existence of peace and disguised democracy in Venezuela because it was built on clientelist strategies that were supported by oil rents. The decline of the world price of oil in the 1980s meant the collapse of an unsustainable system alongside the Venezuelan quality of life which opened the route for the rise of an authoritarian leader, such as Chávez.","['Venezuela', 'Chávez', 'Resource Curse', 'Authoritarianism']"

The Relevance of Socio-Economic Indicators in the Mekong Delta’s Shrimp Industry,"Starmans, Anouk",['I.

The Vietnamese government and national and international organizations use the sustainable development discourse to encourage shrimp systems that are less harmful to the ecosystem. Nevertheless, individual socio-economic circumstances are often neglected while implementing these discourses in the region. This thesis discusses what the relevance of the socio-economic indicators education, household income, and support network are for shrimp farmers to the acceptance of sustainable development discourse concerning ecological degradation in the Mekong Delta. Case study research into two types of sustainable shrimp farming systems was used to find the necessary information and data. Primary and secondary sources were utilised, as well as answers from interviews with experts in the field and shrimp farmers. The thesis concludes that these indicators are very relevant and must not be set aside as being unimportant within the sustainable development projects of the delta because this would lead to impracticality, bad implementation of the shrimp systems, and less sustainable improvement.","['Mekong Delta', 'shrimp-industry', 'sustainability', 'socio-economical indicators']"
The Game of Patronage in Palm Oil Land Deals: Kalimantan's Corruption Cases,"Jauzaa, Nadaa","['Hadiprayitno, I.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The versatility of palm oil makes it a demanded global commodity. Almost every product that we use in daily life contains palm oil. However, as palm oil plantations are mostly located in Southeast Asia’s biodiversity-rich forests, their contribution to massive deforestation has resulted in protests from the international community. As the palm oil industry is also dominated by big corporations, the global demand for palm oil incentivizes the needs for plantation expansions. Despite its adverse environmental impact, the land for plantations incrementally expands every year. Although regulations and policies to control land use for plantations have been enforced, there has been little evidence showing the decrease of land use for palm oil plantations. The patronage democracy, as a key feature of Indonesian politics, enhances incentive favouring the economic interest of business actors. With Indonesia’s democratisation, a pervasive patron-client relationship bolsters the ties between district governors (politicians) and palm oil companies (business), especially since decentralisation in which local governments are responsible for a large part of their own budget. Subsequently, it poses the question: how does patronage democracy halt the effort to combat corruption of palm oil land deals in Kalimantan? From 2 corruption cases of district head’s corruption in Gunung Mas and Seruyan district in Central Kalimantan, this research examines the creation of a system deriving from patronage democracy that halts the effort to combat corruption of palm oil land deals.","['Corruption', 'Palm oil', 'Patronage democracy', 'Kalimantan', 'Indonesia']"

Instant Fetish: An Exploration of Lucas Samaras’ Polaroid Manipulations,"Basu, Inaya","['Westgeest, H.F.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Film- en literatuurwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper aims to explore Lucas Samaras’ Photo-Transformation-series in the context of (sexual) self-fetishisation. Samaras’ work consists of 68 Polaroid self-portraits, most of which have unusual manipulations applied to them. The medium of Polaroid is first explored in order to gain insight on the fetishizing characteristics of the medium itself. Through literature research it is concluded that compared to ‘regular’ analog photography (i.e. with negatives), Polaroids seem to have a higher likelihood of becoming fetishised. Consecutively, a framework determining the characteristics of self-fetishisation in the context of photography is created through literary research, combining elements of both Freudian and commodity fetishism into a concise list of characteristics to analyse two case studies with. Additionally, Lucas Samaras’ manipulations on his Polaroids have been examined, after which they are correlated with the gathered knowledge about fetishisation, leading to the conclusion that these manipulations may have been sexual in nature. Finally, through the two case studies, the context in which the Polaroids were taken has also been deemed an important factor in the self-fetishising characteristics in photography in general.","['Polaroid', 'Lucas Samaras', 'Photography', 'Fetish']"

Japan and the European Union’s shared universal values: Natural Partners or Artificial Allies?,"Engels, Daan",['Lindsay Black'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The year 2018 saw the ratification of both the Strategic Partnership Agreement, as well as the Economic Partnership Agreement between Japan and the EU. These agreements constitute a major enhancement of the bilateral relationship between Japan and the EU. A relationship, as both parties stress, that is founded on shared universal values. The two parties are often seen as natural partners, for both underscore the importance of maintaining the international order which rests upon these values. The EU advocates universal values through the inclusion of conditionality clauses in FTAs, linking political interests such as universal values with commercial benefits. In the past decades, the Japanese government, too, has shifted towards increasingly emphasizing universal values in its diplomacy. However, this thesis challenges the value-orientated rhetoric that surrounds the EU-Japan relationship. In this thesis it is argued that instead of natural allies, Japan and the EU are in fact artificial allies, as both sides interpret and implement values in ways that suit their respective foreign policies. This is demonstrated by means of a case study based on the Rohingya crisis. By analysing how Japan and the EU have approached this situation, this thesis seeks to shed light on a gap between Japanese and European foreign policies, and by extension a gap in the interpretation of universal values.","['Japan-EU Relations', 'Universal values', 'Rohingya', 'Japan-EU Foreign Policy']"
The influence of artistic talent on scientific appreciation in seventeenth-century entomologist illustrations in Europe: To what extent are seventeenth-century entomologists considered to be artists or scientists by contemporary researchers,"König, Kim",['Ksenia Fedorova'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"The seventeenth century, especially in the second half, was a significant transitional era in the history of the study of insects. Some of the most famous names in this regard are Johannes Goedaert, Maria Sibylla Merian, and Jan Swammerdam. All these naturalists carefully observed insects and turned their findings into illustrations; however, Goedaert and Merian, who possessed excellent painting skills, were described primarily as artists by certain researchers, while Swammerdam was described as a scientist. This phenomenon forms the research problem of this thesis, expressed in a question about the connection of artistic skills of entomologists and recognition of their scientific input. The objective of this research is to determine to what extent is the artistic level of the entomologists' illustrations of influence on the level to which they are considered scientists or artists by contemporary researchers. The methods of the research were data analysis of scientific illustrations history and biographical information of the entomologists as well as comparison of the three entomologists' illustrations of the transformation of insects with the use of the theory of the picture by Gabriele Werner. The key results of the research include the findings that the opinions of the researchers could be influenced by the artistic value of the illustrations and the reputation of the entomologists as artists and scientists. The results bring to the conclusion that although art and science go hand-in-hand and complement and reinforce each other, certain aspects of entomologists' life paths can contribute to the fact that researchers attribute them to only one type of activity.","['entomological illustrations', 'study of insects', 'art vs science', 'Johannes Goedaert', 'Maria Sibylla Merian', 'Jan Swammerdam']"

Analysis of Invasive Plant Species in The Hague and their Pollens’ Impacts on Human Health,"Dumitra-Mic, Amelia",['Marco D. Visser'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this academic thesis the impact and extent of effect of invasive alien plant species, specifically their pollen byproduct, on human health is examined. As research on the presence and subsequent influence of such plants’ pollen on a native ecosystem and the humans therein is widely understudied, this study aims to substantiate the repercussions of the ever-growing pollen count of these plants on human health. The goal is to null or verify the assertions that these species spread with little difficulty, exponentially increase the overall pollen count, and contribute pollen variants of harsher impact on human health. The research conducted does a case study of the Netherlands, and specifically The Hague, using two plant species (common ragweed and mugwort) - widely considered invasive in other ecosystems - that remain scientifically overlooked though recorded. Making use of related and comparative data pooled in desk research, a pollen index was constructed to narrowly approximate the pollen count and allergenicity of common ragweed and mugwort. Medical studies test-prove that these invasive plant species have highly allergenic pollen which in turn cause hay fever symptoms. Additionally, the yearly pollen index spanning from 2012 to 2020 showcases an intensification of the allergenicity of the air due to these species, and the weekly pollen index spanning from 2012 to 2015 illustrates clear prolongation of the flowering (i.e. allergy) season through the years. This research paper has quantified the overlooked looming urban, scientific, environmental and medical risk of such invasive plant species’ pollen. Observations of similarly burdened ecosystems has shown elaborated solutions, the like of introducing insects that eradicate these species’ pollen and its spread. The efficacy of these solutions has yet to be weighed including potentially pending consequences (disservices) linked to introducing the alien animal species in the ecosystem.","['Common ragweed', 'mugwort', 'pollen', 'allergic rhinitis', 'urban area', 'The Hague']"
Talking Gender: The Analysation of Gendered Sentence-Final Expressions in the Japanese Animated Film Kimi no Na wa,"Koopmans, Nicole","['Berlo, M. van']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this thesis an attempt is made to examine the use of gendered sentence final expressions in the Japanese animated film Kimi no Na wa. The two research questions stated in this thesis aim to uncover whether there is a trend observable where young Japanese male and female speakers tend to use less stereotypically gendered sentence final expressions (SFE) and more neutral ones. Therefore, the two research questions are: do the two main characters of the film Kimino Na wa mainly use neutrally gendered sentence-final expressions? And does the young female protagonist Mitsuha use more masculine sentence-final expressions than feminine ones? Using data collected in prior studies that demonstrate the traditional gender association of many Japanese SFE, the SFE used by the two main characters were collected and compared to answer these questions. The conclusion shows that there is indeed a trend visible where young female and male speakers tend to use more gender neutral SFE than stereotypical feminine and/or masculine ones. This study would benefit from future research that also takes in mind other gender specific language aspects in the Japanese language, such as pitch, use of honorifics, and use of first- and second-person pronouns.","['Gender', 'Sentence final expressions', 'Sentence final particles', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'animated film']"

The SlutWalk movement stands up against these problems from a feminist perspective. The research question of this thesis is what is the difference between the perception of indigenous and white feminism on la Marcha de las Putas in Ecuador? With the following hypothesis: the concerns and ideas of indigenous women in Ecuador are not taken into account within la Marcha de las Putas, this results in a lack of representation within the SlutWalk movement. The main goal of feminism is equality between men and women. The earlier definition of feminism, written by De Beauvoir (1949) and Butler (1988) will be complemented with the many, contemporary, forms of feminism by, along with others, Ross (2009) and Stefanovici (2016). Feminism in Latin America and indigenous feminism in Ecuador specifically is researched by Bastain Duarte (2012), Sternbach et al (1992) and Hernández Castillo (2002; 2010).

For some women, it is hard to reclaim the word ‘slut’ based on negative historical connections with the word and there is stated that the SlutWalk is a white feminist movement. There is too little research about the connection between indigenous feminism and the SlutWalk. Therefore the case study will be a content analysis of the manifest of la Marcha de Las Putas in Ecuador, whereby the use of the words ‘puta’ and ‘nos’ are being analyzed. The problems indigenous women have with the SlutWalk are not addressed in the manifest, the word ‘puta’ is reclaimed without thinking of the consequences for some women and race and ethnicity is not addressed at all. There is a lack of inclusivity within la Marcha de las Putas in Ecuador.","['feminism', 'indigenous', 'Ecuador', 'SlutWalk', 'inclusivity']"

"Exercising in a Dense Concrete Jungle: A Study on the Relationship Between the Quantity and Quality of Exercising, Urban Density, and Perceived Safety in the City","Middel, Bram","['M.M.A. Mulder', 'H. van Middendorp']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Cities have grown rapidly in recent decades. Several studies have related multiple mental and physical health issues with urban density and perceived safety, related to the increasing urbanization. Studies have established a relationship with urban density and perceived safety with light physical activity as well. However, few researchers to date have specifically focused on the potential association between both factors and regular physical exercise. The current study examined the association of urban density and perceived safety with the quantity and quality of exercise. A population-representative sample (N=124) was surveyed on their quantity of exercise, quality of exercise, experiences regarding urban density, and perceived safety. All four factors were compared to assess relations between the measures. Furthermore, various demographic and density-related subgroups (gender, residency type, and square living space) were selected to assess differences and alternative explanations. Results found associations between all measures, apart from the relation between the quantity of exercise and urban density. Regarding the subgroups, a difference was found between genders and their perceived safety; men felt safer than women. The difference in perceived safety suggested that gender could be a factor related to the quantity and quality of exercise. No differences in urban density, exercise quantity, or quality were found among both residency types and square living spaces; suggesting that both subgroups are not likely to be relevant for the associations of urban density and safety with exercise. More focus should be put on specific measures of the urban environment instead of the home environment. Given the increasing urbanization, more specific research is necessary to better understand the relation between urban density, perceived safety, and regular exercise.","['Urban density', 'Health', 'Exercising', 'Perceived Safety']"
The Efficacy of Turkey’s Soft Power Activities Under the Justice and Development Party’s Rule,"Akman, Servet",['Dr. Eldad Ben Aharon'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Turkey’s foreign policy began to increasingly rely on soft power with the Justice and Development Party (AKP) coming to power in 2002. Economic development and political reforms achieved in Turkey provided the AKP government the means to use the existing soft power instruments and create new ones to pursue its foreign policy goals. Despite the use of extensive soft power resources, Turkey’s foreign policy has been facing many challenges, even in the countries which have been receiving the strong support of Turkey. This situation raises the question of whether Turkey’s soft power policy has been efficient. In this paper, I will try to measure the success of Turkey’s soft power activities by conducting case studies on Kosovo and Kyrgyzstan. I will argue that although Turkey’s soft power activities have yielded positive results in economic relations, Turkey’s intrusive policies and the democratic backslide in the past decade have significantly damaged its image and rendered its soft power activities less effective.","['AKP', 'Turkey’s Foreign Policy', 'Soft Power Instruments']"

What is researched is the determinant role that the news media might have played in the relations of those two countries.Thus, the hypothesis which is examined in this research is that the news media have played an important role in the shifts of the American foreign policy towards Syria from Reagan to Trump, which contributed to a further escalation of the civil war that started in 2011.Then, having outlined the four different phases that will be outlined in the analysis, the thesis initially seeks to draw a link between the news media and foreign policies by looking at the field of international relations. In turn, having drawn a relation, what is introduced is the media framing theory in order to discover how the news media are involved in foreign policymaking. Consequently what is discussed is the debate around the CNN Effect, an aspect which can fall under the framing theory and consists of the increasing ability of the media to influence foreign policy and diplomacy.","['American Foreign Policy', 'Media Framing Theory', 'Foreign Policy Making', 'The CNN Effect']"

The Zapatistas have developed an alternative approach to the Western conception of autonomy, self-organization, and development while sharing substantial characteristics with anarchist practices and praxis. Using Gordon’s framework and Critical Discourse Analysis when analysing three different primary sources published by the movement, it is possible to argue that the Zapatistas are trying to develop their own unique way in order to free themselves from the international and national systems that perpetuate oppression and exploitation. In a Western perspective, the Zapatistas could be called ‘leftists’ or even ‘anarchists’, as they provide an alternative that is most aligned with our way of comprehending, experiencing, and engaging with anarchism and radical political ideologies and theories. However, the movement does not establish itself as openly ‘anarchist’, but it is seeking to create a new way of organizing politics, economics, and society that is not aligned with the hegemonic neoliberal system. In the Zapatistas’ rhetoric we see a mix of different ideas, goals, and values that can be aligned both with participatory development practices, post-development or what we call ‘anarchism’, making the movement to be perceived almost as non-ideological or even anti-ideological.","['Zapatista Movement', 'Anarchism', 'Post-development', 'Participatory Development', 'CDA', 'social movement']"

Language mechanisms, such as the framing and sourcing of both BLM activists and law enforcement were considered, tallied and analysed from differing news outlets such as CNN, Fox News, New York Times, China Daily, NOS and BBC. It concludes that overall, all outlets are found to frame the BLM protests as illegitimate - as they are unacceptable according to the law. However, the degree to which they engage in this discourse differs substantially between each network and so with it, the manner in which these protests were framed as justifiable. The results from international media also provides interesting insight into how BLM is perceived from third parties and each network was found with their own biases and inclinations. This study preposes that to a large degree, news coverage regarding BLM both in the US and beyond proves significantly biased in relation to outlets’ own political stances and origins.","['Black Lives Matter', 'BLM', 'Legitimacy', 'Critical Discourse Analysis', 'CDA']"

Mirjam de Bruijn'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Although international media houses have focused on Boko Haram as the biggest contributor to violence in northern Nigeria, ethnic conflict has caused significantly more casualties in the past few years. This instability has been exacerbated by increases in criminality, terrorism, desertification, and drought that has changed land-use patterns. I argue that the rapid increase in access to Information and Communication Technologies, and especially social media, has created violent conditions by enabling discursive warfare in online spaces, where incendiary rhetoric circulates and is consumed faster than older media forms like newspapers or radio. Using the concept of cultural violence (Galtung 1990) as an umbrella term, this thesis will discuss how the presence of prominent societal norms and ideas legitimize violent discourses and dangerous speech online, which are continuously reinforced and reproduced. In Nigeria, online discourses reveal how dominant beliefs and ethnic labels have become so embedded within the culture that they function as absolute and remain uncontested. As these ideologies spread exponentially on social media, alongside other fake news or misinformation from local news organisations, this has the potential to normalise direct violence. My thesis will focus on this discursive warfare online, and will not attempt to explain how or whether it translates to direct violence because the ramifications of cultural violence are often not immediately visible, but persist and prevail more insidiously, over a longer period of time.","['cultural violence, social media, Nigeria, conflict, politics']"

However, the Philippines still struggles with reducing its poverty rates, more specifically chronic poverty rates. This occurs parallel to high economic growth rates, which should, according to liberal economist discourse, eradicate poverty in the long run. As this is not happening, cash transfer programmes have been widely discussed as a solution to poverty in the last twenty years. By utilizing the case study method, this thesis seeks to analyze, the effects of conditional (CCTs) and unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) on the underlying political, economic processes and sociodemographic factors reinforcing chronic poverty in rural areas in the Philippines. This thesis argues that whilst CCTs have a more positive effect on school enrollment rates for young children, UCTs, are more effective for developing countries to implement and have the same effect as CCTs on the poorest beneficiaries, regarding school enrollment and health expenditure, which disputes the argument of poor people misusing the transfers. The poor can know what is essential, and with UCTs could break the chronic poverty cycle. This paper concludes that as the poor can efficiently utilize their cash transfers, UCTs are the best option to break the chronic poverty cycle in the Philippines.","['Conditional Cash Transfer', 'Unconditional Cash Transfer', 'Chronic Poverty', 'Poverty Reduction', 'Rural Poverty', 'Economic Inclusion', 'Philippines']"
The Mediatic Battle for the 'Blue Homeland': How has the Greek media framed Turkey in the context of the Turkish-Libyan Memorandum of Understanding on the Eastern Mediterranean?,"Pereira Teixeira, Ricardo","['Broad, M.', 'Milevski, L.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The media has played a centripetal role in shaping public opinion and setting domestic and foreign affairs agendas. The Republic of Turkey is a ubiquitous factor in Greek historiography, nation-building processes, and foreign security policy. Throughout their unstable and fluctuating relations, the Greco – Turkish dyad has received copious media attention. In 2019 Turkey and Libya signed a maritime exclusive economic zone (EEZ) Memorandum of Understanding. Such a settlement allegedly balked the EU's planned project to enhance the EastMed pipeline and violated Greece's EEZ, consequently causing an intense media reaction throughout Greece. This thesis applies Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to the publications of Kathimerini and Ta Nea, Greece's most widely read daily newspapers. The analysis brings insight into the media's sociopolitical role, its position regarding the citizenry and the state, and Turkey's importance as an external agent that reinforces the Greeks' in-group cohesion. Considering Aristotelian topoi to approach CDA, the analysis indicates that the Greek media's narrative on the Turkey-Libya settlement frames (i) Turkey as a threatening 'other,' (ii) portrays Greece as the referent object, and (iii) rejects the validity of such a settlement under international law, reinforcing the previous two points.","['Greece', 'Turkey', 'media', 'framing', 'Greek press', 'Critical Discourse Analysis', 'Eastern Mediterranean']"

Navigating the Space between the ‘Chaste’ Female Friend and the ‘Monstrous’ Tribade: The Poetry of Katherine Philips and Aphra Behn,"Oosten, Ilse van",['dr. K. Rolfe'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the expression of female same-sex relations and desire, or queer in union, in early modern England by considering the poetry of Katherine Philips and Aphra Behn each other. To achieve this, this thesis first establishes the cultural categories within which, or outside of which, early modern women could formulate and define their relations with one another and develop a sexual subjectivity by examining various literary and non-literary texts available to early modern women. From these texts, the two contrasting figures of the ‘chaste’ female friend and the ‘monstrous’ tribade emerge. Building on Valerie Traub’s argument, who has shown that these two figures came to be combined during the development of the later perception of ‘lesbian’ identities in the eighteenth century, this thesis illustrates the earlier confluence of these two figures in the poetry of Philips and Behn. While Philips draws on the figure of the ‘chaste’ female friend and Behn on the tribadic or hermaphroditic body, both women writers can be seen to use the same adaptation and reclamation strategies. Going against the early modern perception of female same-sex relation, desire, and sexual acts as impossible, unnatural, and monstrous, Philips and Behn create a preferable, alternative pastoral space in which (sexual) relations can be expressed free from arbitrary, gendered constraints.","[""Early modern women's writing"", 'Gender', 'Sexuality', 'Queer Studies', 'Pastoral poetry']"

Porck']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The joy-term dream has a special place in Old English semantic field studies attracting the attention because of its wide range of meanings and vague etymology. However, there has been no attempt undertaken yet either to determine the metaphorical conceptualisations of dream, or to explore a possible correlation between its use and the type, genre, or chronology of the texts containing it. This thesis aims to fill this lacuna and poses three research questions: 1) What feelings, states and emotions can be expressed through the Old English word dream and its collocation patterns, and what are their metaphorical conceptualisations? 2) How do Anglo-Saxon poetry and prose differ in the manner in which the word dream is used and conceptualised? 3) How do factors like genre (e.g. heroic poetry and wisdom poetry for poetry, and law texts and chronicles for prose) and religiousness of the texts (e.g., religious texts vs. secular texts) play a role in how the word dream was used and conceptualised? On the basis of a close examination of 165 occurrences of dream in DOEC in an episodic or situational context, three conceptualisations of dream are discovered – LIFE, PRIVILEGE and HEAVEN, and eleven contextual meanings of dream related to them. The analysis of their distribution throughout OE poetic and prosaic genres shows a correlation between the use of dream and the type, genre, and chronology of the texts.",

Chinese Community Theater: Voice in The Maternity Chronicles,"Gommers, Sanne","['van Crevel, M.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Chinese migrant workers, who have moved from rural to urban areas to work, are structurally marginalized in cities and rarely get to speak for themselves in public discourses. In this thesis, I explore how migrant worker women’s voices were negotiated in the community theater project The Maternity Chronicles (生育纪事). The relationship between director and participants in community theater is inherently inequal. In this case, migrant worker women themselves played a significant role in most parts of the making of this play, thanks to the community leadership, the attitude of the director, and choices of form. Including the women in the play required not only a space for them to speak, but also active encouragement to take that space. The Maternity Chronicles provided a platform for migrant worker women and others to speak about their experiences with abortion, which is normally considered taboo. The methods of community theater in combination with the tight social fabric and trust within the community facilitated the process of breaking this taboo. This theater project also shows the important emotional function of having voice for those who speak and get to tell their stories. As a community theater project, The Maternity Chronicles aimed to prioritize the voices of participants, and I think it succeeded in creating a space for participants to speak as individuals and as part of the community. We still need to ask to what extent individuals can speak and dissent when they speak as part of a group. Intergenerational differences and claims to the ownership of the experiences portrayed exemplify the diversity that exists within the group of migrant worker women.","['migrant worker women', 'voice', 'community theater', 'China', 'migrant worker culture', 'abortion', 'taboo', 'Chinese migrant workers']"

Functions of the tanuki as a trickster in Japanese popular imagination,"Soppe, Hannelieke","['Müller, D.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I will explain how the tanuki can be seen as an example of a mythological “trickster” (a paradoxical figure who combines god-like powers with a chaotic nature and a love for deceiving and general trickery) and how these trickster tendencies function within different forms of Japanese popular imagination such as art and literature. In my research, I have identified three primary functions. First, the trickster’s shape-shifting tendencies and powers of illusion contribute to a sense of “uncannyness” and tie the tanuki to the mysterious and unknown. As such, “unexplainable” natural phenomena were often attributed to acts of this supernatural being. Secondly, the foolishness of the trickster figure makes it an excellent character for comedic and/or satirical works. The tanuki is no exception to this, as seen in folktales and Edo-era artwork. Lastly, the duality behind the trickster also makes him the perfect mediator between two polar opposites. The tanuki in particular has often been used to signify clashes between urban society and the countryside, as seen for example in the Studio Ghibli film Pompoko.","['japan', 'japanese art', 'japanese mythology', 'yōkai', 'tanuki']"
Reversing Power Dynamics: The Commodification of Disney Within the Kingdom Hearts Series,"Herrero Ortiz, Jaime","['Crandol, M.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper is concerned with the role that The Walt Disney Company’s licenses play within the Kingdom Hearts series, developed by Japanese company Square Enix and directed by Tetsuya Nomura. This franchise has been a major success worldwide, and it is not only because of Disney’s presence; the game displays a large array of original ideas that have enchanted millions of fans worldwide. The aim of this research is to shine light upon the many nuances this video game franchise presents. This research demonstrates how Kingdom Hearts challenges the traditional notion of Disney as a cultural imperialist force. This is due to Square Enix commodifying the larger power, while denoting a deeper correlation between the methods of the two companies. Furthermore, the fact that Disney hands a generous portion of its licenses to a foreign company to be managed and adapted to a completely alien environment, is an occurrence rarely seen before/in the past. The research question reads: How does Square Enix's Kingdom Hearts video game series challenge the traditional view of Disney as a cultural imperialist force in East Asia? In order to answer this question the research explores the discourse of past research written on the topics of Japanese role-playing-games, Disney, cultural imperialism, as well as analysing the video game series itself. This paper argues that the Kingdom Hearts franchise is a one-of-a-kind representation of transnational cooperation, existing outside of the boundaries of cultural imperialism and which reflects the similitude of two different international actors.","['Video Games', 'Disney', 'Cultural Imperialism', 'Square Enix', 'Power Dynamics']"

It is likely that the interface between prosody and morphosyntax, and not merely morphosyntax alone, may play a role in constraining CS. However, the phonetic and phonological reflexes of CS remain relatively unexplored. This thesis aims to improve our understanding of prosodic constraints on CS by examining the speech from a Papiamento- Dutch conversation corpus (Gullberg, Indefrey & Muysken, 2004; 2009). This language pair is eminently suitable for a prosodic analysis because Papiamento has a tonal system with two level tones that interacts with lexical stress, and Dutch a different lexical system: with stress, without tone. I examined whether stress constrains CS in the nominal domain (Akinremi, 2016), and whether Papiamento tone constrains Dutch insertions (Zheng, 1997; Tuc, 2003). Furthermore, I examined whether speech rate in bilingual vs. unilingual utterances differ to add to the research on speech planning in CS (Johns & Steuck, 2021). My findings are that the stress of switched nouns does not constrain CS, but the stress of adjacent words might; Dutch insertions occur mostly in a context where the prosodic systems of Papiamento and Dutch coincide; and speech rate in bilingual vs. unilingual utterances does not significantly differ. I conclude that congruency in prosody facilitates CS and that CS does not inhibit speech planning. Taken together, my findings are compatible with the view that CS may be an opportunistic strategy that bilinguals use to aid speech planning as prosody in both languages openly contributes to production (Beatty-Martinez, Navarro-Torres & Dussias, 2020).","['Code-switching', 'constraints', 'prosody', 'Papiamento', 'Dutch']"
Required Listening: The effects of using audio- and karaoke books in fiction education at Dutch vmbo schools,"Bastemeijer, Laurie","['Weel, A.H. van der']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Literacy skills are declining in The Netherlands. In preparatory vocational education (vmbo) this trend is more visible than elsewhere. Educational professionals are looking for alternative ways to stimulate reading activity, particularly the sustained reading activity that is carried out when reading long-form fiction. Reading long-form fiction has considerable cognitive and emotional effects, but many vmbo-students struggle with this type of sustained reading activity. It is currently being discussed if literacy can perhaps be improved through audiobooks. However, it is not clear if ‘reading’ through other modalities has similar intended and unintended effects on literacy as the reading of alphabetic text has. In this thesis, the properties of visual and auditory reading technologies are compared to see how different methods of reading influence the reading process, both cognitively and in terms of reading motivation. The question is explored along the attentional, cognitive, emotional, phenomenological and ergonomic dimensions. The thesis considers embodied reading, modality-specific affordances, impact of (environmental) factors and the way these affect mental interaction with the text. This demonstrates that audiobooks can be used to improve skills related to literacy, but they do not invoke every skill used when reading alphabetic text. The most significant shortcoming of audiobooks is that decoding skills and attention retention are not strengthened as they are with print reading. However, audiobooks can increase vocabulary knowledge, comprehension and reading motivation, particularly for struggling readers. For them, the underexplored option of dual channel reading can also be a worthwhile reading alternative. Existing research suggests that dual channel reading diminishes the cognitive load and working memory effort which typically interfere with the development of high order reading skills. Ultimately, the question which reading method suits best is dependent on the abilities of students and the intended effects and purposed with which is being read in school.","['literacy', 'multimodal literacy', 'audiobooks', 'dual channel reading']"

In June 2019, the building projects in UAE were estimated at 3 trillion AED. This construction industry sustains itself through the thousands of migrant workers it employs who mostly belong to South-Asian countries such as India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, etc. Generally, they are carried to the GCC via the Kafala system​. This essay will aim to answer the question, “What are the various ways that are used to contest the condition of the migrant labourers against the state in UAE?” In order to answer the question, this essay will first give a brief overview about the conditions and general situation of the migrant labourers, how the exclusion of labourers is done through the citizenship rules, kafala system and lack of labour laws. The literature review will discuss different theories to try and explain the mechanisms behind immigrant protests in the UAE. Further, the paper will discuss the various ways that have been used to contest the conditions of the migrant labourers against the state including protests and suicides by the labour, international pressure, efforts by activists, non-governmental organisations and students. It will analyse what methods have been successful and which have not been successful in bringing about change. This thesis agrees with the statement that while the UAE has made recent changes to their Labour Law and Kafala System which are indeed a step in the right direction, they need to actually enforce the changes through proper channels and governance while also increasing the penalties significantly in case the law is broken by wealthy sponsors and companies who exploit migrant labourers by charging them exorbitant fees in order to stop the long standing system of exploitation and treatment of migrant labourers as slave labour.","['Migrant Labour', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Contesting Labour Conditions', 'Kafala System', 'Migrant Labour Protests']"

While there are some individual anti-discrimination laws in place that cover certain areas of discrimination there is yet to be one comprehensive anti-discrimination law that serves as general protection against discrimination for all citizens. South Korea does currently not have comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation but there have been multiple attempts at implementing such legislation over the years. So, why exactly is it that 14 years after the first anti-discrimination bill attempt Korea still finds itself without anti-discrimination legislation? By looking at both the past and the present of anti-discrimination legislation in South Korea we will be able to get a better understanding of the legislation’s future and its prospects.

The Smartphones’ Push Into India’s Hyper Competitive Digital Socio-Economy,"Mijnster, Berine",['I. Hadiprayitno'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis aims to show the impact of the increased demand and use of smartphone technology, since 2008, in India from a socio-economic perspective. The Indian economy is digitizing rapidly, and the smartphone market is one of the main components. However, there is a lack of research on the socio-economic impacts of the growing smartphone market in developing countries like India. This research argues that the increasing smartphone technology and its market has positively impacted India's socio-economy. This research has mainly been conducted through qualitative research with some quantitative research. Many literary sources have been studied to examine the impact. The most important results of this study are the economic growth the smartphone market has caused and the rise of direct and indirect job opportunities through this market. Further, how the growing smartphone market has resulted in women's increased safety and emancipation and accessibility of education for many Indians. Lastly, the research showed that even in a crisis, such as the Corona crisis, the smartphone market is still profitable as the smartphone will keep playing an important role or become even more critical. Therefore the conclusion is that the introduction of smartphones in 2008 has positively impacted India's socio-economy.",

The purpose of the analysis is to understand the extent of the power repetition has on the arts. As well as whether social media and most importantly Instagram, can be considered post-museums that accelerate repetition and digital mass-reproduction of the art. Moreover, the second chapter of the thesis focuses on the notion of post-museum and how it can acts as a platform for mass production and repetition. In order to investigate the subject, the thesis will centralise on contrasting opinions of Walter Benjamin and Andy Warhol. Benjamin argues that repetition and reproduction take away the aura of the artwork, while Warhol argues that it provides authority. The result of the analysis shows that repetition and reproduction have immense power over the value of the arts within post-museums. It can either elevate an artwork in terms of its significance, power, and valuation, yet at the same time, it can be the reason why another artwork becomes nearly invisible.","['value of art', 'aura', 'post-museum', 'Andy Warhol', 'Instagram']"

Through a combination of qualitative code analysis and discourse analysis, three main figurations have been identified: 1) The Rights-Holders/non-Rights-Holder, 2) the Victim and 3) the Community Member. Strengthened by various queer, feminist and critical citizenship studies, this thesis uncovers the schemes in which these figurations influence the delineation of citizenship. By diving deep into various encounters between the state and the above-mentioned queer figurations, this thesis shows how queer citizenship is organised. Through these encounters, it is shown how the Dutch state and COC Nederland cooperate in discursive practices of constructing figurations in a semiotic relationship. Examples of encounters that are treated are: equal marital rights, the culturalization of citizenship, the mobilisation of queer victimhood, police presence at Pride and the rainbow symbol.","['international relations', 'queer theory', 'citizenship', 'COC Nederland', 'figurations']"
Open poorten: Hernieuwde Arabisch-Joods relaties door tweetalig geschiedenisonderwijs in Israël,"Rodenburg, Rafaël","['Englert, S.P.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In 2015 former president Reuven Rivlin claimed that Israel needs a redefinition of Israeliness to preserve the Israeli society. According to him, a new national identity must be created, with which all citizens can identify. When looking at the Israeli educational system, it becomes apparent that such a redefinition is necessary. As multiple studies have shown, the Arab- Palestinian community in Israel is not only marginalized in terms of the quality of the educational system, but also with regards to the contents of the education, mainly -but not limited to- in the field of history education, which amongst others ignore Palestinian perspectives on the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict and which deny Palestinian belonging to the country. As this thesis shows, bilingual schools in Israel offer a radical alternative historical narrative that includes Palestinian perspectives, that treats Jewish and Palestinian identities on an equal basis and that at the same time creates an overarching narrative (or if you wish Israeliness) which connects both communities. At the same time however, this thesis argues that the success of the alternative historical narrative at bilingual schools is limited due to the same inequalities the education tries to counter, namely the lack of classes on Palestinian/Middle Eastern history, the continuing dominance of Jewish-Israeli frameworks for teaching history and the dominance of the Hebrew language. Nonetheless, although progress can still be made, the alternative approach to education of bilingual schools provide an inspirational basis for redefining Jewish-Palestinian relationships in the future.","['Israel', 'Palestine', 'bilingual', 'education', 'history', 'identity']"

Sustainable Development and Tourism in Egypt: An analysis of the long-term effects of the tourism industry in Egypt on sustainable development with a focus on environmental degradation,"Muhrman, Sara","['Englert, S.P.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The study covers the topic of sustainable development and the tourism industry in Egypt with a special focus on environmental degradation. The overarching research question for the study is ‘How does the tourism industry affect sustainable development in Egypt?’ Three case studies were used in order to demonstrate how the industry has affected the environment of the Red Sea. Based on the analysis of the case studies conclusions have been drawn concerning the effect on environmental degradation and how this subsequently affect the other two areas of sustainable development, social and economic development, in the long – term. The results of the paper show that the tourism industry, although it may have short – term positive social and economic effects, have long – term overall negative effects. The focus on long – term development here is critical for this conclusion, since sustainable development implies long – term development through which the current generation can fulfil their needs without jeopardizing the ability of future generations to fulfil theirs. If the tourism industry continues their current practices of environmental degradation, it will destroy the very environment on which the industry relies for many of its activities but also the very environment on which humanity relies. Environmental degradation of the Red Sea in particular also affects the fishing industry which is another important sector of the Egyptian economy. A loss of revenue both within the sector itself, and other economic sectors relying on the environment may lead to increased unemployment and thus a decrease in general social well – being. This demonstrates how the tourism industry can have long – term negative economic and social effects on the society as a whole. Lastly, the discussion brings up the issue that political instability causes to the tourism sector and the relationship between them. A faltering tourism industry as a result of environmental degradation can contribute to further political unrest due to increased environmental and economic difficulties, thus creating a vicious cycle of negative effects. This clearly demonstrates the importance of developing sustainable practices within the tourism industry, not just for economic reasons within the industry, but for the stability of the Egyptian society as a whole.","['Sustainable development', 'Tourism', 'Egypt', 'Environment']"

Academic interest in particular has come so far as to spawn its own field of ‘Tolkien Studies’, entirely dedicated to the study of Tolkien and his oeuvre.

This thesis will consider the signs and instances of reverence and religion from an ‘in-world’ perspective, in the same fashion that a wanderer of Middle-earth would encounter them, and in doing so, brings a new and valuable approach to the Christian/Pagan debate, namely the approach of the writer and the sub-creator.","['J.R.R.', 'Tolkien', 'Middle-earth', 'Fiction', 'Religion', 'Dwarves', 'Elves', 'Nature', 'Ancestors']"

It is widely believed that the EU's democracy promotion in Georgia has been inextricably linked to one of its key foreign policy instruments, namely, the democratic conditionality. In recent years, the EU has been able to induce several transformative democratic reforms in Georgia by tying them to big ""carrots"", such as the signing of the Association Agreement (AA) encompassing the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) and the Visa Liberalisation process. Considering that Georgia had never received an official EU membership perspective when the country achieved this crucial milestone, experts questioned whether the EU could induce transformative democratic changes in this Black Sea region country and how. Specifically, the strategies, instruments or tools that the EU might employ to push essential democratic reforms adoption and implementation became a point of contention. This thesis attempts to address this debate by answering the following research question: How does the EU attempt to induce democratic reforms in Georgia without conditionality in place? The thesis is based on two case studies within a single case study on Georgia. The first case is related to the EU-promoted anti-discrimination law's adoption and implementation, and the second case study covers the EU-brokered March 8 Agreement encompassing a comprehensive electoral system reform in Georgia. In both cases, the EU appears to play a critical role, albeit through different mechanisms and tools at its disposal. The thesis attempts to provide a reader with a nuanced analysis of the EU's perceived role in the above-mentioned transformative democratic reforms' adoption and implementation in Georgia. The author employs the following qualitative methods for the offered case studies: a qualitative content analysis and in-depth interviews with experts and elites.

De overweldigende gelijkenis tussen het schilderij, ontstaan tijdens Van Laers verblijf in Rome, en de Necromancers van Angelo Caroselli (1585-1653) en Pietro Paolini (1603-1681) maakt echter duidelijk dat het afbeelden van een specifiek type magiër: de necromancer, een Romeinse traditie was. Deze Necromancers waren in trek bij de Romeinse clientèle en kwamen terecht in de collecties van belangrijke kardinalen, die de schilderijen verzamelden vanwege hun spottende en vermanende ondertoon. Een analyse van de Romeinse context laat zien dat magie alomaanwezig was in de Eeuwige Stad, maar er is geen bewijs dat Van Laer er zelf bij betrokken was. Tijdgenoten merkten bij Van Laer geen bijzondere belangstelling voor magie op, maar wel een humoristische inslag. Deze humor is terug te zien in het schilderij; Van Laer dreef de spot met zichzelf, andere schilders en de schilderkunst in het algemeen door zich af te beelden als falende magiër. Het Zelfportret als necromancer, zoals het werk zou moeten heten, sloot dus eerder aan bij een algemene magische trend dan bij een persoonlijke belangstelling van de schilder.","['Rome', 'magie', 'Bentvueghels', 'zelfportret', 'humor', 'Accademia di San Luca']"

This refers to the debate around racial inequality that arose in early 2020 in which racism was claimed to be institutionalized. With slavery being an obvious example in history that shows how racism took on a structural and institutionalized form, it is essential to critically analyze how the narrative on the inhumane and degrading treatment of black Africans is told. In this thesis, two senior year havo-level secondary school history textbooks, Feniks and Geschiedeniswerkplaats, will be analyzed using a Critical Discourse Analysis. The storyline on the slavery period will be assessed critically, focusing on the selection of narratives and phrasing. The results show the presence of the Color-blind discourse, in which storylines take on a passive voice, and Racially essentialist discourse, where the selection of black Africans is biologically justified. Both textbooks lack a description on the wider social opinion towards the black community and therefore fail to address these racist attitudes.","['slavery', 'racism', 'historical narratives', 'textbooks', 'education', 'discourse']"

Gain Shift in the Nested Hierarchies of Language,"Messi, Aline-Priscillia","['Chen, Yiya', 'Ten Oever, Sanne']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Experimental approaches to sentence processing focus on localizing areas responsible for language comprehension in the brain oftentimes disregarding the role of time in both the construction and deconstruction of linguistic structure. Inspired by predictive coding and cue integration, this thesis proposes a theoretical framework for sentence processing where the hierarchical structure of language and its evolution over time profoundly influences its processing leading to time-contingent weighted integration of information. Essential to this theory is the assumption that the reliability of the internal representations generated by each level of linguistic analysis influences the gain of the predictions formulated by the other levels. Multivariate Pattern Analysis was used to compare the gain of semantic and phonological processing at two different timepoints in a sentence. Experiment 1 was the design of an EEG Multivariate Pattern Classification experiment where the classification accuracy of a phonological and semantic classifier for words in early and late positions in a sentence would be compared. We expected classification accuracy of the phonological classifier to be constant regardless of word position and a higher classification accuracy for the semantic classifier at later time points relative to the phonological classifier. Experiment 2 was a Representational Similarity Analysis of nouns in early and late positions from MEG audiobook data.

Does 'dondon' sound like a bigger drum than 'tonton' to non-speakers of Japanese too? A study on the perception of Japanese mimetics focused on Dutch listeners with no knowledge of the Japanese language,"Sekreve, Paco","['Yoshioka, K.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In Japanese mimetics, a pattern in which expressions that use voiced consonants are associated with relatively bigger referents - compared to their voiceless equivalents - can be widely observed. In order to examine if this trait is either language-intrinsic to the Japanese language or can be considered as showing a level of universality, an experiment with 54 Dutch speakers with no knowledge of the Japanese language was conducted. Based on a previous research by Haryu and Zhao (2007) in which Chinese participants were used and the association in question did not seem to be effective, this thesis aims to shed a new light on this phenomenon by instead of Mandarin speakers, using Dutch speakers as participants. Based on multiple linguistic factors, the Dutch participants were expected to perform better than the Mandarin speakers and the results showed this was indeed the case (75.1%). Therefore, the results of this research suggest that within the mind of a Dutch native speaker, the associative link of voiced consonants with relatively bigger referents is present and is therefore not language-intrinsic to Japanese.","['Japanese mimetics', 'universality', 'language-intrinsic', 'perception of mimetics', 'voiced vs. voiceless consonants']"

The Bronze Soldier of Tallinn and the Politics of Memory in Estonia,"Doyle, Eoghan","['Rodriguez Idarraga, Nicolas']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In April 2007, the streets of Tallinn bore witness to the worst civil unrest seen in Estonia since the Soviet Red Army arrived in the city in 1944. The riots, in which one ethnic Russian protester was killed and over 1,000 were arrested, came to be known as ‘Bronze Night’ and were sparked by the removal and relocation of a Soviet-era monument, the ‘Bronze Soldier’, which had stood in the centre of the city since 1947. This study argues that the removal of the ‘Bronze Soldier' can be viewed as the culmination of a ‘memory war’ which has played out since independence and which highlights and contributes to a rift in Estonian society. Drawing on insights garnered from memory studies and elements of securitization theory, this study argues that the construction of a singular focused ‘memory regime’ by the Estonian state has led to increased marginalisation of the ethnic Russian population in the state. Such marginalisation led to the creation of a counter-memory regime, embodied by the ‘Bronze Soldier’, which was easily exploited by the Russian state. The ensuing ‘memory war’ between both interpretations of history ensured ongoing hostility and antagonism between both ethnic groups which culminated in the events witnessed in 2007. This study argues that the construction of a more critical and pluralistic historical narrative on the part of the Estonian state, as opposed to an incessant fixation on Russia, would ensure increased integration in Estonia and subsequently, foster a greater feeling of security on the part of the Estonian state.","['Estonia', 'Russia', 'Collective Memory', 'Memory Politics', 'Bronze Night']"

The Foreclosure Crisis: An Analysis of its Consequences on Neighborhood Safety in Cleveland,"Roovers, Alif R.I.",['Alistair Kefford'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The financial crisis of 2008 was an economic catastrophe that shook the housing market in the United States. Its devastating impact was marked by mass home foreclosures that spread across the country. Many homeowners defaulted on their mortgages and were evicted from their homes. For the neighborhoods that became vacant, it became more attractive for criminal activity. However, whether or not empty neighborhoods drew in more crime due to foreclosures remains understudied. This thesis, therefore, sought to advance the research by employing both quantitative and qualitative approaches by examining two neighborhoods in the city of Cleveland. The analysis controlled for demographic and economic factors that have potential influence over foreclosure and crime. Results from elasticity calculations indicated both a positive and negative inelastic response of crime with respect to foreclosures, suggesting mixed conclusions. The results of qualitative data collected from media reports, documentary videos, and photographs on the other hand indicated a more significant impact of crime on the neighborhood environment and its residents.","['foreclosures', 'crime', 'subprime mortgages', 'real estate']"

Patriarchal structures and gender biases that hinder women's representation are pervasive and can be identified in seemingly progressive governments, challenging claims of increased gender equality in the global North. This thesis explores the differences in female political representation in parliament between two popularly deemed progressive European countries: the Netherlands and Finland. It does so by adopting a novel approach and engaging with the top-down personal perspective of politicians within parliament. Using semi-structured elite interviews, this thesis focuses on the causes for the gap in female political representation between these countries while also discussing what the interviewees envision as possible improvements. The parliamentarians provided unique insights into how gender stereotypes, gatekeeping, and unpaid care work determine the level of women's political representation. The results indicate that female parliamentarians, next to having more role models, centred childcare and parental leave at the core of the policies to address the disparity in female representation between the Netherlands and Finland and increase female political representation overall. This thesis thus contributes to gender and political studies.","['Gender', 'Feminism', 'Female political representation', 'Finland', 'the Netherlands', 'interviews']"
Language and Intentionality: Exploring agency in language use as a marker of identity among Senegalese street sellers in Florence,"Tiberi Venturucci, Bernardo",['Maarten Mous + Mayke Kaag'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Since the 1980s, Italy has become one of the leading destinations of Senegalese migration and one of the countries with the most numerous Senegalese population in Europe. Along with other African diasporas, Senegalese migrants in Italy are an object of interest of the national media that generally portray them as a monolithic group, uniformed under simplistic images and victim of its circumstances. The presence of this community has also been the interest of many scholars within the social sciences. In their works, these scholars adopted a more nuanced and objective look towards Senegalese migrants’ conditions in Italy, taking into account agency and diversity in dealing with the complex situation of this migrant community. Building from the corpus of research laid down by these works, this thesis contributes to the discussion on Senegalese migrants’ agency from a different perspective. Drawing from the example of Senegalese street sellers working in Florence, the present work shows how the use they make of language can be seen as a way to recover actors' agency. Specifically, by considering the use they make of language as an identity marker, the present thesis reveals the role that Senegalese street vendors have in dealing with their new (linguistic) circumstances. Within this framework, intentionality in language use works as a concept to understand and investigate agency. In this way, the present work sheds light on language use as an asset for Senegalese street sellers’ agency; moreover, it gives a practical solution to understand and analyse agency by pointing to how intentionality may be expressed in language use.","['Agency', 'Identity', 'Intentionality', 'Italy', 'Language use', 'Multilingualism', 'Senegalese migrants', 'Street sellers']"

Confinadas y Fugitivas: El espacio como intervención en el orden moderno-colonial-patriarcal en ‘El gobelino’ (1983) de María Elena Llana y ‘La culpa es de los tlaxcaltecas’ (1964) de Elena Garro,"Lassche, Rob","['Timmer, N.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,es,"‘El gobelino’ (1983), de la escritora cubana María Elena Llana, y ‘La culpa es de los tlaxcaltecas’ (1964), de la mexicana Elena Garro, son relatos que exploran las dinámicas de espacio y género a través de la ocupación de las esferas pública y privada y los elementos fantásticos a su disposición. Por medio de las huidas, las muertes, la heterotopía domiciliar y las supuestas enfermedades, ambas escritoras crean mundos que se establecen como una suerte de ruptura con el orden colonial-patriarcal. No en forma de manifiestos, sino a través de ambigüedades y contradicciones, concretizadas en sus personajes. Por vía de estos conflictos, que surgen desde mi análisis de los textos, pretendo arrojar luz sobre la similitud de problemas que se presentan en el contexto moderno de ambos. La denuncia que se rescata de los cuentos radica precisamente en exhibir la tensión contenciosa que existe entre los procesos modernizadores en América Latina y las reclamaciones por la liberación femenina. Ante las continuas luchas emancipadoras y a la vez la creciente resistencia contra estas en muchos países latinoamericanos, se hace relevante pensar las nociones de género en los relatos de ficción, herramientas ―como estudiaremos― de intervención cultural. Bajo esta luz, consideraremos dos textos que provienen de contextos que se destacan por su carácter clave en el transcurrir de los procesos de libertad en Latinoamérica. Marcada por diferencias a escala sociopolítica, la comparación entre un cuento cubano y otro mexicano en este trabajo, establecerá un análisis de las representaciones de confinamiento y huida femenina en el marco de un orden patriarcal-moderno continuo.","['Espacio', 'Género', 'Modernidades latinoamericanas', 'Literatura fantástica']"

China’s BRI Engagement with Cambodia: Its Effect on Containing Cambodia’s Political Opposition,"Sok, Sonida","['Wits, C.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper provides insight into the nature of Sino-Cambodian relations in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative and a country-specific perspective through a research method based on empirical findings and academic debates within the secondary literature on this topic and its research objectives. It has analysed and compared various perceptions on Cambodia’s ruling party and its motives to engage with China economically and politically through the BRI. This has been supported by the acquired facts on Cambodia’s crackdown on the opposition, the events surrounding the 2018 elections, client- patron structures, and trends of political and economic reliance. Furthermore, to acquire data of public opinion on Hun Sen’s increased cooperation with China, this paper has analysed Cambodian opinion pieces on Sino-Cambodian relations using interpretive, qualitative content analysis. It has therefore conducted an analysis of Cambodia’s ruling party, its objectives, and the implications for the political environment viewing China’s active role in providing political and economic support through the BRI. Consequently, this paper has found that Chinese aid and investments have been important to Hun Sen’s government in containing the opposition through political and media repression. Through the BRI, China’s non- interfering aid and investments enabled the ruling party to use more authoritarian measures against a growing political resistance.","['China', 'Cambodia', 'Sino-Cambodian relations', 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'Democratic backsliding', 'Authoritarianism', 'Media censorship']"

Nevertheless, a band called LEENALCHI was able to score a hit in 2020 with their song “Tiger is Coming”. The song is based on a p’ansori epic and is sung in p’ansori style, but it contains a twist. LEENALCHI creates fusion music, which is music that combines Korean traditional music and contemporary music. With their ‘new’ version of p’ansori, LEENALCHI is gaining much popularity in Korea and they are now the face of both the Korean Tourism Organization as well as several brands. Their presence in the Korean entertainment industry thus ensures that p’ansori, which was facing extinction despite the support of the Korean government, has once again become part of lived Korean culture. This thesis tries to examine how LEENALCHI is able to repurpose p’ansori and consequently popularize a form of intangible cultural heritage that has been struggling to keep up in relevance. In doing so, this thesis establishes how intangible cultural heritage can be repurposed even when preservation seems to become increasingly complicated.","['South Korea', 'p’ansori', 'fusion music', 'Korean traditional music', 'Korean performance art']"

"The dissemination of the Ilminjuŭi ideology during the First Republic through media and the government, and how it vanished from the political sphere.","Sanders, Ramon Johan","['Jang, S.Y.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Koreanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Ilminjuŭi is generally known for an ideology that President Syngman Rhee attempted to use in the early years of the First Republic in order to create a single-minded unity. There are many writings about Syngman Rhee, and he is often portrayed as a nationalist and staunch anti-communist. However, the part where he tried to promote Ilminjuŭi and how this ideology functioned during his rule, often gets overlooked. Ilminjuŭi has been only a minor focus of studies on Syngman Rhee and his long career of fighting for an independent Korea and for what he thought was right. Most of the existing literature explain what Ilminjuŭi is, who created it, and that Rhee tried to use this idea of creating a single-minded unity during the early years First Republic, before the start of the Korean War. This thesis therefore distinguishes from existing literature by looking at primary sources from Korean news articles during the time of the entire First Republic. The news articles are used to give an idea how Ilminjuŭi was reported through media and how this idea was being disseminated. The ideology seems to have died out shortly after the Rhee period. Therefore, I went on an academic journey to analyze how and where this ideology was most influential, and where was the turning point that led to Ilminjuŭi becoming less influential in Korean society. The research questions of my thesis are therefore, “How was Ilminjuŭi spread and reported through media, and spread by the government during the First Republic?” and secondly, “What were possible indicators that led to the vanishment of Ilminjuŭi?”.","['Ilminjuŭi', 'Syngman Rhee', 'First Republic', 'ROK', 'DPRK', 'Ahn Ho Sang', 'history', 'ideology', 'communism', 'anti-communism', 'nationalism', 'One-People Principle', 'post-colonialism', ""Ilminjuŭibogŭp'oe"", 'Korea Nationalist Party', 'Liberal Party', 'Chayudang', 'Korea Democratic Party']"

In zijn artikel, waarin hij ook de ‘dood van de oudheidreceptie’ na de val van de Muur impliceert, verwijst Riedel bijna uitsluitend naar de herinterpretatie van klassieke Griekse mythen. Vooral in de jaren tachtig was er echter een ‘Romeinse tendens’ waarneembaar bij auteurs als Heiner Müller en Volker Braun: in plaats van het ‘umdeuten’ van Griekse mythen brachten deze auteurs in hun werk juist elementen uit de Romeinse oudheid naar voren. Aan de hand van voorbeelden uit het late werk van Heiner Müller en het vroege werk van Müllers bewonderaar Durs Grünbein probeert deze scriptie een antwoord te geven op de vraag naar de continuïteit van de oudheidreceptie in het werk van DDR-auteurs voor en na de val van de muur in 1989: waarom wenden Müller en Grünbein zich vooral tot de laat-Romeinse geschiedenis in een literaire omgeving waarin de receptie van Griekse mythen alomtegenwoordig is?","['DDR-Literatur', 'GDR literature', 'Heiner Müller', 'Durs Grünbein', 'Intertextualität', 'Intertextuality']"

This master thesis consists of six chapters. The first one is introduction, when the next one is literature review. The third chapter is research methodology. Two next chapters are analytical and based on conducted qualitative content analysis. The first of them (chapter four) is about contemporary Polish-French international relations, and the next one (chapter five) about French perception of the strategic potential of Poland. The last chapter includes conclusions. This thesis is part of a broad academic debate about how Western Europe perceives Eastern, based on the example of Polish-French relations. One of the supporting research questions concerns whether this division is still valid in contemporary European relations. The qualitative content analysis carried out indicates that it is not a decisive factor, similar to ideological differences between the governments of Poland and France. In addition, this master thesis emphasizes the importance of perception in international relations, but also indicates its variability, depending on both external and internal conditions.","['France', 'Poland', 'perception', 'strategic potential', 'state power', 'Weimar Triangle']"

The Protests of Hong Kong in 2019 is one of the most severe crises that the country has encountered in the recent years, especially when Xi’s administration has aroused controversies within the nation. Learning from the umbrella movement of 2014, Xinhua News Agency becomes prudent and cautious about reporting the Protests of 2019 to its domestic audiences and readers. This thesis found that compared to Ming Pao, a Hong Kong-based Chinese-language newspaper, Xinhuanet, the online news platform under the control of Xinhua News Agency, avoids reporting disadvantageous news against the Chinese governments. From this perspective, I try to provide evidence to prove that media in China are integral to the political propaganda.",

Japanese securitization of Taiwan: The concept of security in JMOD and MOFA policy documents.,"Beckers, Shawn","['Chang, V.K.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"When asking: what do humans need to survive? The word ‘security’ will be unmistakably an important answer to that question. When asking: what do states need to survive? The same word is, again, an inherent concept that is interwoven with its survival. But what is security? For humans the answer seems obvious: having a steady source of food and water and not being in physical danger. Yet in recent times even this has been challenged and concepts such as ‘identity’ and ‘freedom of fear’ are debated to be also important in the concept of ‘security’. This already is a complex debate, but when it comes to states, the answer is yet even more complex. Because a state, unlike a human, is not a physical object, but as Anderson famously argued, is an ‘imagined community’ (Anderson, 1983). Then what does security mean for a state? This study aims to contribute to this understanding by deconstructing and critically examining ‘national security’ in a policy case study: Taiwan in Japanese foreign (security) policy documents.","['Security', 'Japan', 'Taiwan', 'MOFA', 'JMOD']"

A variety of mechanisms are identified by which Haitians and people of Haitian descent are positioned as ‘the other’ and are defined and treated as different from the host community in the Dominican Republic. Anti-Haitian attitudes are widely acknowledged to exist in the Dominican Republic but it is unclear whether these are driven by racist ideologies or fears of losing national sovereignty. This paper builds upon the study conducted by Craemer and Martinez (2021), who identified four Haitian stereotypes; anti-Black, anti-immigrant, criminal violence, and anti-Haitian stereotypes. A content analysis is conducted of articles containing the search term ‘Haiti’, from 2020 to 2021, in two Dominican newspapers (El Listín Diario and El Día) and two Haitian newspapers (Rezo Nòdwès and Juno7). This thesis adds to the previous study by examining the content of Haitian newspapers and corroborating previous results. Consistent with Craemer and Martinez, this study finds the strongest stereotype-consistency bias in the criminal violence stereotypes. Diverging from this, the anti-Haitian stereotypes showed a significant increase in stereotype-consistent bias. This contradicts conclusions drawn by Craemer and Martinez. The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.","['Haiti', 'Dominican Republic', 'anti-Haitianismo', 'anti-Haitian stereotypes', 'discrimination', 'migration']"

An Update for German Democracy - Reducing the Legal Voting Age to 16,"Levin, Raphael","['Heyer, Dr. Anne']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"On what basis can we justify including or exclude our political future from formally participating in elections? This thesis ponders on what argumentative basis an update for German democracy is necessary and justified. More specifically, whether the legal voting age can be reduced from 18 to 16 in Germany. For this, a qualitative methodology was employed, by conducting multiple semistructured interviews with 16 and 17-year-olds. Alongside the literature review, this methodology helped understand the conceptualisations and operationalisations of existing arguments for and against awarding the right to vote to 16-year-olds and onwards. This thesis finds that the central arguments, namely the Normative, Political Understanding, and Maturity arguments are conceptualised and operationalised significantly differently in the existing literature and by the interview participants. Overall, however, a broad consensus on the limited quality of political education in German high schools has been identified and subsequently rendered 16 and 17-year-olds insufficiently prepared for political participation. Finally, this thesis concludes that the inclusion of potential beneficiaries in the assessment and decision of reducing the legal voting age to 16 is an imperative prerequisite to effectively and efficaciously updating our democracies. Likewise, the inclusion of 16 and 17-year-olds in this thesis has provided us with the insight and incentive to improve our political education and to improve our democracies as a whole.","['Political Participation', 'Democracy', 'Reduced Legal Voting Age', 'Germany']"

A Domestic Affair: Women In American Higher Education Between The 19th And 21st Century,"Wedel, Larisa","['Kessel, van L.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis entails a historical comparative analysis of the three feminist waves, based on a historical literary analysis, and is exemplified by three case studies that illustrate each specific time period. The historical analysis and the case studies are then compared in order to evaluate historical changes and developments. Through this, the following research question is answered, ‘What does a historical comparative analysis of four women between the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries show with regard to the effects of changing domesticity values on the roles of women in American higher education?’ The women chosen for the case studies both diverged from, and conformed to social rules in their time period, thereby illustrating which rules exactly were in place. Therefore, the effects that these expectations had on women in higher education are illustrated as well. The term domesticity that is used in this thesis is derived from the Cult of Domesticity that was present in the 18th and 19th centuries, prohibiting women from entering the public sphere in any way. The effects that domesticity had on women in higher education is evaluated through mechanisms of femininity and masculinity, the ‘duality of education’ by Anderson-Faithful and Goodman, and the ‘feminist dilemma’ by Joan Scott. These themes show that domesticity has influenced women in higher education, and continues to do so, despite improvements in women’s social and legal rights.","['women', 'education', 'America', 'feminism']"

With the use of an online questionnaire, I wanted to find out whether native speakers of Farsi are better at categorizing the English word-final plosive voicing contrast than native speakers of Dutch, because native speakers of Farsi have native-language experience with the same contrast in the same position. The results show that both the Dutch and the Farsi group were relatively successful in distinguishing this contrast, but the Farsi group categorized it significantly better. The results of the Dutch group are in line with previous literature that indicate that perception of an L2-contrast is supported by native-language experience with the same contrast in other positions. Additionally, the results of the Farsi group imply that perception of an L2-contrast becomes even better when there is native-language experience with the same contrast in the same position.","['second language acquisition', 'final devoicing', 'Farsi', 'Dutch', 'English']"

In these three novels, all characters are subject to the constraints of the social class system. Although researchers such as Dominic Head and David Malcolm have contributed to the debate around the social relevance of McEwan’s novels, few researchers have analysed the three aforementioned novels in the light of social class and its effect on human agency. In the three aforementioned McEwan novels, the character's agency is hugely influenced by the social class system. This thesis will focus on the effects the constraints of their social class system have on the characters’ agency. I am specifically interested in the interaction between social class and human agency. I will argue that all characters are subjected to these constraints. Moreover, the characters’ agency is to a large extent dependent on the social class to which they belong.",['19380']

Self-Fulfillment and Selflessness: Women’s Roles in Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women,"Neeleman, Skylar","['Rolfe, K.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is often praised for the way it encourages women to chase their own dreams and break out of the rigid gender norms that often confine them. However, simultaneously, the novel also seems to value and even encourage nineteenth-century ideals and gender roles, and encourage women to be selfless. The question then becomes how the novel is able to promote these seemingly contradicting values alongside each other, and what effect this has on its message. This thesis set out to find an answer to this question by examining in detail how both self-fulfillment and selflessness are being promoted in Little Women. Doing so showed that the novel actually approaches both ideas with incredible nuance. Women are generally encouraged to pursue self-fulfillment, regardless of societal expectations and gender norms, but only when selflessness is part of this self-fulfillment. Similarly, selflessness is encouraged as long pursuing it does not happen at the expense of personal happiness and fulfillment. The novel shows that the two ideas are, in fact, more complicated than they seem, and that though self-fulfillment and selflessness appear to be two opposing values, they are actually not mutually exclusive.","['Little Women', 'Women', ""Women's roles"", 'Gender roles', 'Gender', 'Selflessness', 'Self-Fulfillment', 'Alcott', 'Louisa May Alcott', 'Nineteenth Century', 'American Literature', 'Literature']"
