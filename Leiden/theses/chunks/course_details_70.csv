Policies for women’s empowerment and gender inequalities in Japan. A study of the gender gap and Womenomics’ awareness among Japanese working women.,"Concas, Enrica","['Shibata, Saori']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Women’s empowerment is the pivot point of this paper; it investigates the contemporary Japanese women’s awareness of gender inequalities in the workplace and Womenomics. This thesis attempts to suggest possible solutions to gender discrimination in the Japanese workplace. To accomplish this goal, this paper employs a quantitative method for data collection. The chosen sample consisted of Japanese women employed in Japanese companies alone. At a later stage, data analysis was done through a qualitative approach. Respondents’ feedback to the questionnaire was fundamental to draw this project’s conclusions. In this regard, Japanese women seem not to be aware of Womenomics’ contents and the majority of them consider these polices as useless in terms of women’s empowerment. By contrast, they are well aware of gender inequalities at their workplace, and they offered valuable solutions to solve the problem. A prospective awareness-raising intervention is considered essential because it would help to sensitize people to the problem and to faster gender equality’s fulfillment. Moreover, if people were aware of the persistent gender gap in contemporary society, their perception would encourage leaders to take action for the creation of a gender-equal society. According to the majority of the questionnaire’s respondents, if people cooperate as individuals and not as men and women, it will possibly be a starting point for gender stereotypes’ elimination.","['Gender awareness', 'Japanese working women', 'Japanese society', 'Gender inequalities', 'Japanese gender gap', 'raising awareness']"
Parting Ways With the Global On-Screen Lesbian: A Critical Study of Blue is the Warmest Color and The Handmaiden,"Prallet, Agathe","['Crandol, Michael']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Blue is the Warmest Color and The Handmaiden are two examples of mainstream contemporary lesbian cinema. Through their example, this paper shows the presence of a pre-existing global model of lesbianism in cinema that is being challenged by new lesbian films in the past decade. Through their example, this paper will show how local manifestations of lesbian cinema challenge the expectations of a previously established Global On-Screen Lesbian. The literature review first highlights the crucial lack of recent lesbian cinema analysis, along with a drive for the visible and the mainstream. The analysis of Blue is the Warmest Color and The Handmaiden showed that both are embedded in the idea of the Global Lesbian, as shown by the lingering tropes and other characteristics of the pre-established global lesbian cinema. Nevertheless, each film defies what is expected of the Global On-Screen Lesbian by actively walking away from traditional tropes and narratives, while anchoring themselves in their respective local culture.","['blue is the warmest color', 'the handmaiden', 'lesbianism', 'lesbian cinema', 'cinema', 'korean lesbian cinema', 'french lesbian cinema']"

Trade Union Capacity in the Age of Neoliberalization: Comparative Analysis of Public Sector in Lithuania,"Cancingeris, Matas","['London, Jonathan D.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since the end of the Cold War industrial relations (IR) in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), on top of inherited ideological-institutional legacies from the Soviet era, have undergone significant structural changes that are widely believed to have diminished organized labor’s power and significance. According to leading political economy and IR approaches, the pattern is the most pronounced in what are referred as neoliberal Baltic states, featuring among the weakest labor movements across CEE that are resembled in lagging behind IR regimes institutionalization, trade union density and collective bargaining coverage. However, when we turn our focus to the public sector explicitly, the manner and degree in which IR regimes have changed across CEE varies in ways that stand in tension with broad widely accepted labels, leading to mistaken ideas. To prove the inconsistency of the exaggerated regional patterns and typologization, this research will assess a strange case of relatively substantive, but varied public healthcare and education organized labor performance in the past few years in Lithuania, discussing both external and internal factors that make up the capacity of trade unions.","['Trade Unions', 'Central and Eastern Europe', 'Industrial Relations', 'Lithuania', 'Public Sector']"

Who Are They? Social Identity Theory’s Contribution to Understanding Identity Discourses of Home-grown Terrorism in the UK,"Schwarz, Jessica","['Van der Maat, Eelco']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since the events of 9/11 and the war on terror, there has been a rise in Islamist terrorism and its subcategory of home-grown terrorism, where the perpetrators of terrorist violence are born and raised in the countries of the attack. The purpose of this thesis is to contribute to the understanding of home-grown terrorism by offering an application of social identity theory to the phenomenon’s relevant identity discourses. To do so, this thesis sets out to deconstruct and analyse the significant identity discourses constructed by British government officials and Islamist terrorist organisations. This thesis identifies a push and pull dynamic between British and Islamist identity discourses where vulnerable British Muslims feel alienated and pushed away from British society’s emphasis on assimilative secular, liberal democratic values and instead find the appeal of the global Muslim community, the ummah, as an inclusionary, unifying sense of identity. Certainly, terrorism and home-grown terrorism are complex phenomena without single explanations, but this thesis puts forwards identity as a complementary explanation for home-grown terrorism as it ties in existing explanations such as historical and political grievances and socioeconomic inequalities. Because identity is often constructed on an exclusionary basis, where an individual must be one or the other and never both, social identity theory’s ideas of social comparison and positive group worth explain the need for terrorists to harm other identities to increase its own identity’s social worth.","['Identity', 'Terrorism', 'Discourse']"

This thesis will examine the reinvented Russian foreign policy interest in the African continent and explain this by looking at geopolitical influence, arguing that Russia’s geopolitical interest can be explained by the Great power competition with the United States and China, and furthermore discussing how isolation from relations with the West have had effect on increasing relations with Africa. Looking at military influence, it will argue that Russian arms trade to African states can be seen as an incentive to keep states unstable to increase arms trade. Last, this thesis will argue that there is much opportunity for economic trade in minerals and energy and examine how Russia is making use of the opportunity. Analyzing these different spheres show a trend, Russian state affiliated companies, which are not concerned with human rights and democracy protection are doing the dirty work for the Russian state and thereby taking the accountability away from the state.","['Foreign policy', 'Russia-Africa relations', 'geopolitics', 'Great Power competition', 'Energy trade']"

Pre-Proto-Indo-European ergativity and the ‘neuter agent gap’ in typological perspective,"Groen, Melle","['Kloekhorst, Alwin']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"A number of features of the morphosyntactic alignment systems of Indo-European languages suggest that an early stage of the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) originally had an ergative case-marking system. Opponents of this hypothesis have said that this reconstruction of PIE is typologically impossible, since it does not follow the allegedly universal Silverstein hierarchy, and that PIE thus cannot have been ergative. A concept related to the theory, which may solve the problem that Silverstein’s hierarchy poses, is the hypothesis that this stage of (pre-)PIE had a ‘gap’ in its alignment system: i.e. neuter nouns could not be used as agents of transitive verbs. In my thesis, I weigh the pre-PIE ergativity hypothesis and the ‘neuter agent gap’ against typological data regarding alignment systems and their diachronic development, to see if opponents’ arguments are valid and whether an ergative system and a neuter agent gap can be reconstructed to account for the case-marking systems found in Indo-European languages. I argue that the reconstructed alignment system does not violate Silverstein’s hierarchy, and that an earlier stage of PIE had an ergative system in both common and neuter nouns. Then, I argue that it is not necessary to assume a ‘neuter agent gap’, although a semantic dispreference for neuter agents does help to explain the development of alignment in the Anatolian languages. I then discuss two different hypotheses on what shape the neuter ergative ending may have had, and I will propose for both of them a diachronic pathway along which the Indo-European alignment system may have developed.","['Comparative Indo-European Linguistics', 'PIE', 'Ergativity', 'Language Typology']"

Hij gebruikte dit idee om de Opstand tegen Spanje vanuit een religieus perspectief te legitimeren. Dit deed hij door de inwoners van de Nederlanden te vergelijken met het volk Israël uit het Oude Testament. Bijbelse verhalen werden gebruikt om de gebeurtenissen in de Nederlanden te duiden. Marnix' gebruik van het idee wordt gekenmerkt door een context-gebonden variatie die hem in staat stelde in alle omstandigheden een voor de opstandelingen hoopvol perspectief te schetsen. Hij zag het bestuur van God als meest fundamentele oorzaak achter de gebeurtenissen in de Nederlanden en beschouwde de Opstand als een conflict dat ten diepste religieus was. De context-gebonden variatie die hij hanteerde is te verklaren aan de hand van de veranderende politieke context, het publiek dat hij voor ogen had en het genre waarin hij schreef.","['Opstand', ""'tweede Israël'-idee"", 'Marnix van Sint Aldegonde', 'Religieuze legitimatie']"
Is Education Enough? Exploring the Ontological Perceptions of Albinism in Tanzania,"Alcolea Krauss, Rebecca","['Van Dijk, Rijk']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"While perceptions of albinism have always been characterized by difference, it was not until the mid-2000s when brutal killings of people with albinism (PWA) occurred that the government attempted to tackle this problem through education. Almost twenty years later, discrimination and violence against PWA is still present in Tanzania, leading to questions about the effectiveness of an educational approach in combating such developments. Findings from my field research have revealed that people in the northern region of Tanzania perceive albinos to be a different ontological entity, which sustains violence and discrimination against PWA in the country. Most importantly, the governmental and non-governmental educational approach in tackling such problematic perceptions of albinism are proven insufficient in light of such ontological difference. My main recommendation is that education in Tanzania needs an ontological turn, which means that understanding and teaching should be done from the standpoint of albinos and society should be looked at from that perspective.","['albinism', 'ontology', 'perceptions', 'education']"

The Controversy of Protected Areas: A Case Study of the Karen People in Thailand,"Portier, Chevelle","['Hadiprayitno, Irene']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The rapid rate of global environmental degradation has stressed the need to protect our ecosystems. This environmental issue is often approached by applying the status of a ‘protected area.’ This research seeks to explore the controversy of protected areas as a conservation method, through a case study analysis of the indigenous Karen people located in Thailand. The legal status of protected areas has led to instances of forceful evictions, harassment, and restrictions on accessing resources due to the exclusive nature of this conservation method. However, the Thai decentralisation since 1997 argued for greater local participation and inclusion in decision-making processes. Therefore, this analysis focuses on two factors, firstly, the various ways how the Karen people have been marginalised through protected areas, and secondly, to what extent the decentralisation of Thailand’s political system has contributed to the oppression of the Karen. With the use of this case study, this thesis intents to contribute to the field of political ecology and provide a deeper understanding of how state power has legitimised the negative consequences on indigenous communities through the application of protected areas for the sake of conservation.","['conservation', 'protected areas', 'Karen people', 'Thailand', 'decentralisation']"

Evaluating Policies and Prospects of Alphabet Reform: The Case of Kazakhstan Considered in a Comparative Lens with Uzbekistan,"Parent, Robert","['Stapert, Eugénie']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"History has shown us that human language, and the media and mechanisms used to record it, are changeable. The languages of Uzbek and Kazakh are currently experiencing such transformation in the form of an alphabet transition, in both cases from Cyrillic to the Latin alphabet. Uzbekistan officially commenced this reform in the early 1990s, with Kazakhstan following suit in 2017. Historically, both nations have switched alphabets on several occasions. Uzbekistan’s most recent attempt is widely considered a failure due to the length of time already involved, alongside the fact that it still remains far from complete. An examination of the shortcomings with Uzbekistan’s reform allows us to chronicle key factors involved in facilitating successful change; public opinion, education, politics, and linguistics. This thesis explores those factors within the Kazakhstani context through primary research. A survey was created with questions relating to the four factors and was taken by seventy-five respondents consisting of Kazakhstanis, Kazakh speakers, and several experts in the field of linguistics and alphabet reform. Quantitative and qualitative data was sought and compared to prior scholarship concerning Uzbekistan’s reform, in order to determine the likelihood that Kazakhstan’s reform would be more successful. Kazakhstan’s policymakers have no doubt attempted to learn from Uzbekistan’s mistakes. However, complications caused by COVID-19, in addition to a lack of public information coming from the government as well as an incomplete version of the Kazakh Latin alphabet could lead to Kazakhstan’s alphabet reform being dragged out over a long period of time, implying a potential failure akin to Uzbekistan’s. However, the study also determined that recently-elected Kazakhstani President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev is dedicated to completing the reform in a conscientious and unhurried manner, thereby increasing Kazakhstan’s chances of successful Latinization. Serbia’s system of synchronic digraphia, officially utilizing both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets, is a potential failsafe – or solution – in the outcome of a failed reform.","['alphabet reform', 'Kazakhstan', 'Uzbekistan']"

The Effect of Linguistic Encoding on Memory: The case of Dutch placement verbs,"Walrave, Renske","['Mulder, H.N.M. de']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Dutch has a caused posture system that distinguishes two placement verbs, zetten 'to set' and leggen 'lay’. This study explores this semantic distinction from a descriptive viewpoint and uses this analysis to investigates the psycholinguistic effects of it on memory for placement events in native Dutch speakers. This study questions a) what factors determine the semantic distinction between zetten and leggen, b) whether linguistic encoding in general affects memory, c) whether specific linguistic encoding affects memory (i.e. does verbalizing placement events enhance memory for these events in Dutch speakers) and d) whether the fact that a language makes its speakers think about specific features i.e. encoding specific features of placement events vs. not encoding specific features of other motion events) enhances memory for these features in general. Descriptive results show that participants use leggen ‘to lay’ for horizontal scenes and zetten ‘to set’ for vertical scenes. Contrary to earlier findings, the results show that the placement of a round symmetrical object is approached differently than those of cubic symmetrical objects. Psycholinguistic results show that linguistic encoding has a positive effect on memory in general. However, specific linguistic encoding does not result in a significant enhancement of memory for placement events. At last, the results show that the fact Dutch makes her speakers think about specific features of placement event does not affect memory for these: memory for placement events in general was not enhanced compared to memory for other motion events.","['Dutch placement verbs', 'Placement events', 'Verbalization and memory', 'Linguistics']"

"Good State, Bad State: The Politics of Voicing Dissent and the Case of 'Landless Moroccans'","Ameziane Hassani, Sara","['Cristiana, Strava']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2017, the documentary film ""Landless Moroccans"" was released which shed light on the expulsion of the Guich Oudaya tribe from their land in the capital city of Rabat as well as their protest against this expulsion. This thesis investigates what the film can reveal about political claim-making and state-society struggles in contemporary Morocco. By focusing on how the state is addressed and claims are attempted to be legitimized, it argues that the film produces a good vs. bad dichotomy between the monarchy and the state which uncovers the authoritarian environment within which dissent is voiced in Morocco. This dichotomy reflects a state discourse aimed at diverting state critique from the monarchy to the government and other executive authorities. Applying Pierre Bourdieu's field theory, this research illustrates that the film's reproduction of state discourse is at once a proof for its internalization as well as a strategy to position the protest safely vis-à-vis the regime. The discursively produced dichotomy identified in this thesis can thus give further insights into the ways in which civil society actors may navigate protest in authoritarian settings.","['Morocco', 'documentary film', 'field theory', 'land struggle', 'political protest', 'Bourdieu']"

"The Perception of Profanity Amongst Dutch Adolescents in Different Environments, Sociodemographic Settings, and from Different Socioeconomic Statuses","Hoogstad, Maxime Hoogstad","['Jeffery, Jill V.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Recently, there has been a renewed interest in understanding the linguistic behaviour of humans when profanity is used. However, much of the current literature focuses on adult participants, the factual usage of swear words or the distinction between English as an L1 and L2 when using profane expressions. Thus, the perceived profane behaviour amongst Dutch adolescents still has to be understood. Hence, this research aimed to analyse the perception of frequency and severity with regard to profane behaviour amongst Dutch adolescents. As a result, four research questions were posed in order to compare the perceptions of adolescents to profanity in relation to two demographic factors, namely, socioeconomic status and urbanity. The different social contexts and the perception of severity related to such contexts were also explored. The current study employed a crosslinguistic approach using both a questionnaire and follow-up interviews as tools. The results of this research show that the lower socioeconomic status group perceived their swearing behaviour as less frequent compared to average and higher socioeconomic statuses. The degree of urbanity for the places in which the schools were situated was divided into three categories: urban, semi-urban, and rural, based on the official ranking of the Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek considering the address density (CBS, 2019). When regarding the perceptual parameter for frequency and severity, the findings yield similar results, concluding that the students in rural areas perceive to use the most frequent, and severe profane words. Lastly, the different social environments in which Dutch adolescents perceive to use profane words were analysed. The findings show a general tendency of profanity being expressed in informal environments, and in particular in the presence of friends. However, it seems unacceptable to utter swear words when in the presence of a family member or an authoritative figure. This study implies that Dutch adolescents perceive to use swear words frequently, distinguishing between mild swear words such as """"kut"""" """"fuck"""", and """"shit"""" versus more severe expressions such as """"kanker"""" """"tyfus"""" and """"homo"""". This is in line with the existing literature 4 (see, e.g. Jay, 1992; Jay & Janschewits, 2008). In order to gain more insight into the perspective of Dutch adolescents, further research could be required.","['acceptability', 'adolescents', 'Dutch school system', 'demographic differences', 'perception', 'profanity', 'offensiveness', 'severity', 'social environments', 'socioeconomic status', 'swearing']"

Within recent years China and Russia have cooperated increasingly with each other in the field of energy. This study aims to identify the role of Russia within Chinese energy security and how this has progressed, since China became increasingly dependable on energy imports. Building on energy security literature, this thesis asks: How has Russia’s role as energy supplier changed within Chinese energy security since the rapprochement in 1990? Within this context Energy security is used in the classical definition of the “availability of sufficient supplies at affordable prices”. Based on an alternative of the four A’s Model, this thesis makes use of the ‘Availability’, ‘Accessibility’ and the ‘Affordability’ in order to research Chinese energy security and the Russian role of this within it. Analysis have proven that the role of Russia has improved greatly over time. The results also indicate that Russia is having an increasingly larger role with Chinese energy policy, but China refrains from making itself dependable by a successful diversification strategy","['China', 'Russia', 'Energy Security', 'Sino-Russian relation', 'hydrocarbon']"

The Impact of Video Games on the English Vocabulary Proficiency of Dutch Teenagers,"Coerdes, Ellen","['Fonteyn, Lauren']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study explores the impact of video gaming on the English vocabulary proficiency of Dutch teenagers from the ages of 11 to 16. Recent academic research argues that the beneficial impact of video games lies in the unintentional and natural acquirement of a second language, which is enabled by the element of interactivity in games (Plass & Jones, 2005). According to language acquisitional theory, language is most effectively acquired when the message is provided with context, as this enriches the apprehension of the subject (Krashen, 1989). Furthermore, intrinsic motivation to acquire a language is intertwined with the motivation to engage in play, which in turn leads to more linguistic confidence and eventually successful language acquisition (Melzi & Schick, 2012; Prince, 1996). This research contains a survey-based analysis on the linguistic impact of video games on Dutch teenagers. The survey was answered by 59 Dutch teenagers of the age group and consisted of a translation exercise and a sentence exercise. The answers of both exercises were analyzed on the basis of how often the participants engaged in the activity of video gaming. To avoid faulty analysis, the answers were also compared to the factor of age. The results of this study suggest that teenagers who game more frequently are linguistically more confidant as compared to the participants that did not game frequently and lack this confidence. More importantly, the results suggest that the frequent players are more proficient in English vocabulary than the non-players as they translated more words correctly. Besides this, the players with the highest frequency seemed to engage more often in English communication with other players. This all indicates that not only do video games have a beneficial impact on the vocabulary proficiency of Dutch teenagers, but they also contribute to the linguistic confidence and experience in English communication.","['Video Games', 'Second Language Acquisition (SLA)', 'Linguistic Confidence', 'Vocabulary Proficiency']"

Attitudes towards Dutch subtitling and dubbing,"Eisma, Rinske Simone Patricia","['Santos Ângelo Salgado Valdez, Susana']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Netherlands is a country with a subtitling tradition. This tradition would suggest that Dutch viewers generally have a more positive attitude towards Dutch subtitling compared to Dutch dubbing. However, this subtitling tradition does not seem to have been established at the hand of the attitudes of Dutch viewers towards both modes, considering these attitudes have received nearly no coverage in academic work. This is problematic, since a lack of data on these attitudes makes it challenging for translators of audiovisual media to create translations that are suitable for a Dutch audience. Therefore, this thesis collected data on the attitudes of 53 Dutch participants towards Dutch subtitling and dubbing in the Netherlands through an online questionnaire. The results show that the participants prefer Dutch subtitles over Dutch dubs, but also rate the overall quality of both modes in a similar manner and even list slightly more disadvantages for Dutch subtitles than Dutch dubs. There also appears to be a consensus amongst the participants that children are the main target audience for Dutch dubs, and most participants indicated that Dutch dubs are the most suitable for children’s programs, cartoons and commercials. Furthermore, 69.8% of the participants believe that there is a negative stigma surrounding Dutch dubs and 88.7% of the participants stated that they do not desire for more audiovisual media to become available with Dutch dubs. Additionally, 49.1% of the participants indicated they do not desire for more audiovisual media to become available with Dutch subtitles either. Although 56.6% of the participants indicated they do not feel restricted by Dutch subtitles, the majority of the participants stated that they frequently disagree with the translation choices in Dutch subtitles. Finally, 66% of the participants indicated that they prefer English subtitles over Dutch subtitles. While these findings only represent the attitudes of 53 Dutch viewers, they can form a starting point for future research regarding attitudes towards both modes in the Netherlands.","['translation', 'subtitling', 'dubbing', 'attitudes', 'reception', 'audiovisual translation', 'case study']"
Assimilation Strategies at the Carlisle Indian Industrial Boarding School: A Project of US Cultural Hegemony,"Moerland, Stefanie","['Van Kessel, Looi']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"During the late 19th and mid 20th centuries, Native American boarding schools were implemented throughout the United States and Canada. Within the boarding school system, assimilative strategies were implemented. This study primarily analyzes the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. It asks: To what extent does an analysis of the Carlisle Indian Industrial boarding school demonstrate strategies and a U.S. hegemonic project of assimilation of Native Americans into the dominant culture? Based on a review of the literature on systematic racism in US educational systems and the theory of Hegemony data was analyzed. The results indicate that the current debate on Native American boarding schools entails many different experiences, values, and cultural aspects. Native American students were, upon return, more linguistically assimilated. In addition, many former Native American students experience issues related to mental health, alcohol, substance abuse and family related problems. Based on these conclusions, future studies should address the evolvement of the assimilation process, and to what extent Native American culture is being maintained.","['Native American Boarding Schools', 'Systematic racism', 'US history', 'Assimilation', 'Hegemony', '19th century']"

Life in the time of a violence epidemic: The joint decrease of homicide rates and perception of security in São Paulo,"Kadlec, Jiří","['Solheim, Håvar']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis took around four months to get completed. During this time, over 13,000 people were murdered in Brazil – more than the total of Syrian War victims in 2019 (Globo 2019; SOHR 2020). But comparing tragedies is not this work’s purpose. Instead, the aim is to contribute to the understanding of the complexity of violence and security in the state of São Paulo, the most populated federal unit of Brazil. The violence has become so dire in the whole country that major media, as well as international organizations, started calling it an epidemic (World Bank 2018; Boechat 2018). To understand how the epidemic works, public security is approached with the perspective of perception of safety, which is argued to be underrated in the Brazilian context. The first chapter offers an overview of the current academic debate, with public security and perception of safety being the guiding concepts. The second part has a rather political point of view. Public policies in the field of security are analyzed, with an emphasis on the paradigms that guided legislative decisions. That is also how the chapter with the case study begins. The effectivity and consequences of individual decisions are questioned. Next, the perspective shifts from political to social, challenging the way security and violence are put in numbers and arguing that homicide is overestimated as an indicator. Additionally, the reliability of how crime data are collected and published is assessed. For there is a vigorous debate about what made homicide rates drop so much in São Paulo, but very little effort has been made to question the data on which this debate is based. Since the fall is confirmed, the factors that could explain the consistent drop in killings in the state since the turn of the century are analyzed. Then, the link – or better, its absence – between homicide rates and perception of security is examined. Despite a considerable murder reduction, São Paulo is still far from not being regarded as dangerous by its people. Therefore, public security elements that deserve greater heed are outlined. Finally, the conclusion zooms out from the case study and places it in a wider perspective.","['Public Security', 'Homicide Rates', 'Perception of Security', 'Brazil']"
"Yass Queen! ''GAYER'' IDENTITY, GENDER AND CULTURE: GAY SLANG AND ITS SEMIOTIC USAGE IN POPULAR MEDIA","Diepen, Rob van","['Smakman, Dick']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This dissertation focusses on the gay identity construction in an online environment. The performativity of identity and the existence of a separate gay culture are discussed. Gay identity can be constructed regardless of sexuality. 1.Can gay slang construct gay identity on a social media platform such as twitter and what context or demographics might be relevant to do so? 2.How gay are the terms coded according to the respondents of the NRE compared to the other 4 sources? 3.Can anyone participate in gay culture? This will be examined by looking at how and who use 10 slang terms on Twitter selected from Rupaul's Drag Race. Next to this a Natural Response Elicitation is also conducted, a questionnaire posted on Reddit with three questions per term regarding users, meaning and context. There were several results concerning the meaning of the terms, the users and the context of the usage. All these led to see which terms could, and in which context, construct gay-identity. And in turn, whether outsiders can participate in gay culture. The main conclusion is that the meaning given to the terms, the users of the terms and the context in which they are used are relevant in order to perform gay-identity through gay linguistic expressions.","['Identity', 'Gay', 'LGBTQ', 'Applied Linguistics', 'Sociolinguistics', 'Gay Slang']"

"Queer Violence and the Post-Colonial State, the Case of Nigeria","Seklemova, Niya","['Thakur, Vineet']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Considering the urgency posed by the violent homophobic conduct of Sub-Saharan African states towards males who appear as challenging the socially dominant standards of masculinity and sexuality, this thesis aims to problematize queer violence in the African post-colony. Queer violence is hereby defined as the violence inflicted upon the bodies and lives of citizens of the post-colonial state on the sole ground of their perceived or actual sexuality. Looking into the underexplored case of Nigeria, this thesis asks the following question ‘How has the Nigerian state exercised queer violence?’ Based on a review of the literature, the building blocks of the homophobic discourse (laws, morality, tradition and religion), which legitimize queer violence in the African context, and particularly in Nigeria, are discussed. In order to criticise the persisting violent conduct and unveil how queer violence functions, queer theory is utilised together with Foucault’s notion of biopolitics and Mbembe’s necropolitics. Additionally, a genealogical approach helps analyse the state conduct through its discursive, but also non-discursive/material practices. Through the analysis of the occasion of the arrests and arraignment of 57 men in Lagos, Nigeria from August 2018 through March 2020, for offenses related to same-sex relations and homosexuality, it is observed that the Nigerian state has exercised queer violence by disguising its necropolitical conduct in biopolitical terms. It has been further observed that queer violence is performed indiscriminately, endangering especially the male population.","['Homophobia', 'Discourse', 'Masculinity', 'Sexuality', 'Queer violence', 'Non-Discursive Practices', 'Sub-Saharan Africa', 'Necropolitics', 'Law', 'Traditions', 'Religion', 'Post-colonial state', 'Morality']"

European Monetary Integration: Understanding the Narrative through the Eurozone Crisis,"Gundimeda, Udbhav","['Tsagdis, Georgios']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The explanatory and predictive power of theoretical analysis has played a fundamental role in shaping European monetary integration. The ambition to integrate into a solidified and sustainable monetary union has often been evaluated against a framework of economic convergence and creation of an effective supranational institution. However, the turn of events over the last decade has changed the perception about monetary integration in Europe. The Eurozone crisis, one of the biggest crises encountered in Europe, forced European Union’s institutions to take measures that could overcome the crisis and simultaneously facilitate integration. The need to understand the narrative that drove monetary integration during the Eurozone crisis has become significantly important due to its widespread impact and lasting repercussions. In analysing such consequential events, the purpose of this research is to compare and contrast the ambitions of European Monetary Union to the realities that drive monetary integration within Europe. This study will undertake the critical analysis of two crisis management responses adopted to tackle the Eurozone crisis, namely the Stability and Growth Pact and the European Stability Mechanism. Utilising these responses, this research attempts to construct the theory of Liberal Intergovernmentalism and understand the general pattern that drove monetary integration in Europe since the Eurozone crisis.","['European Monetary Union', 'Eurozone Crisis', 'Liberal Intergovernmentalism', 'Optimum Currency Area']"

It is often remembered as the only “real” war fought by the United States during the Cold War period, but this is not an accurate statement. The first “real” conflict of the Cold War began right as the battle-lines were drawn in 1950, when North Korea crossed the 38th parallel and invaded the South attempting to unify the peninsula on their terms. he Korean War represented the first physical clash between the two ideologies that would dominate the latter half of the 20th century, but its memory and media portrayal do not carry the same impact as that of Vietnam.

Eurovision: Performing State Identity and Shared Values,"Shields, Catrina","['Scott-Smith, Giles']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Eurovision Song Contest has, since its establishment in 1956, became a forum for European interaction and space where European identity is defined and performed. Participating states are expected to embrace the established shared norms and values, while presenting their cultural identity to a global audience. Examining Eurovision through mega-events theory, this thesis will answer: how are mega-events utilised by states and their critics to present and disseminate competing narratives on the host state’s identity and right to host? To do so, the 2019 contest in Israel will be examined as a case study to demonstrate how mega-events can be instrumentalised by states and critics. In doing so it also explores the dangers inherent in hosting a mega-event. This thesis will conclude that Israel utilised the hosting of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2019 as an opportunity to present a clear narrative of Israel as a legitimate and worthy member of Eurovision, and by extension Europe, by echoing the values of the contest. However, critics of Israel also utilised the same show to counter this narrative by challenging Israel’s adherence to Eurovision’s values and the ability of Eurovision to uphold its apoliticality when hosted by a controversial state. These competing narratives demonstrate how mega-events create a forum both for hosting states to disseminate their narratives and for critics to counter it, it also demonstrates how the values of a mega-event can be instrumentalised by critics to attack and delegitimate the hosting state.","['eurovision', 'mega-events', 'public diplomacy', 'narratives', 'shared values', 'European Identity']"

Art and Totalitarianism in Film: Analysing the Cinematographic Representation of Art in Totalitarian Societies,"Damyanova, Yoana","['Keblusek, Marika']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis was inspired by a film. While watching James McTeigue’s V for Vendetta (2005), I came to notice the similarities between the film’s dystopian society and twentieth century totalitarian regimes—the Third Reich (1933-1945), Fascist Italy (1922-1943), and Soviet Russia (1922-1991)—and their respective treatment of art. In order to answer the question of how art is represented in films about totalitarianism, and contextualize this relationship historically, six films have been analyzed. These films have been selected for their depiction of fictional totalitarian regimes which bear resemblance to the aforementioned three historic ones. A discussion is created which analyzes how art and material culture in the films are used to indoctrinate the people and reaffirm the government’s power. This includes not only propaganda posters and images, but the use of symbols and sigils, as well as the use of art to establish the regime as a new religion. The desire for a “one true art form” to replace the degenerate arts and promote the regime, as seen in the Third Reich and Soviet Russia especially, is not seen in the films, which instead focus more on a holistic ban on art and culture. Finally, the way degenerate art is represented in the film shows it to provide support for the narrative. Most art seen in the films belongs to the characters who embody the rebellion or those with enough power and resources to exist above the illegality of art ownership.","['art', 'totalitarianism', 'film', 'cinema', 'dystopian society', 'representation']"

Even though a peace agreement was achieved just before the turn of the 21st century, the country continues to experience a clear sectarian divide. Worldwide, many states are faced with similar problems of political or religious divides, often resulting in violence. Solutions to this type of violence are much debated and sought after, meaning that investigations into previous conflicts and how these were handled, or perhaps could have been prevented, are still of great importance, even decades after.

Multilingual LGBTQ+ Youth: Queer Language and Identity,"Lambert, Abigail","['Alves Vieira, Eduardo']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,This study aimed to investigate the ways in which multilingual Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer/Questioning+ (LGBTQ+) youth in Dutch cities make use of English originating ‘queer’ language and why they utilise it. A mixed-methods survey was used to collect data in order to answer the research question (how and why do multilingual LGBTQ+ youth in Dutch cities make use of ‘queer’ language originating from English?) and sub- questions. The content of the survey was developed in response to past research and consisted of three sections which each investigated different aspects of the research question. The results showed which lexical items are most commonly used by the LGBTQ+ youth aged 18-30 in Dutch cities and also demonstrated that English is overwhelmingly the preferred language of use when multilingual LGBTQ+ youth wish to discuss/describe their sexual/gender identity. The results also suggest that ‘queer’ language is being used to create a sense of belonging to a community and to better integrate and socialise with others within the LGBTQ+ community.,"['Multilingualism', ""'Queer' Language"", 'LGBT Linguistics', 'Identity', 'Sexuality', 'Gender']"

The Struggle of Freedom: From Berlin to Peterson,"Schlüter, Nina E.","['Ieven, Bram K.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"What does it mean to be ‘free’? The simple and immediate answer that comes for many people is probably, ‘I am free if I am able to choose what I do.’ Whilst this may be true, it fails to address key issues in the discussion of freedom, such as how or if freedom can be attainable if others are hindering your will. This paper will seek to examine what is meant by ‘freedom’ beginning with an overview of free will and how this relates to freedom itself. The works of Isaiah Berlin (1909-1997) will be used to examine freedom alongside some of his critics such as Rousseau and Kant. Further to this the ethical question of freedom of speech will be remarked upon with relation to Jordan Peterson, a professor of psychology. Finally Berlin’s ideas about freedom will be applied to Peterson’s arguments for the protection of free speech as well as those who argue against Peterson in the public forums of a televised debate and a televised discussion panel, in which Peterson was a participant. This research combines the disciplines of philosophy, culture and socio-politics to attempt to reach a well formulated and in depth conclusion answering the question, “How does the philosophical concept of ‘liberty’, as understood by Isaiah Berlin, relate to the ethical and socio- political freedom of speech debate, specifically pertaining to discussion of freedom of speech versus usage of gender pronouns in the discussion of gender identity and identity ethics?”","['Freedom of Speech', 'Freedom', 'Gender Identity', 'Identity Ethics', 'Political Freedom', 'LGBTQI+', 'Gender', 'Free Will']"

Disruption in Art: A Study on Colour and Emotion Through Ellsworth Kelly’s Red Green as a Disruptive Piece,"Ruiz Álvarez, Laura","['Westgeest, Boers']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research considers Ellsworth Kelly’s Red Green as an artistic disruptive practice that contributes to the deconstruction of some of the hidden structures that form society as a group of individuals with a shared identity and common history. Ludwig Jäger’s approach to disruption has been the trigger to believe that the colours red and green could be unveiling the raw medium that relies under Kelly’s final message. However, the problem arises when realising that the message depends on the individual who reads it and their concepts of colour. For this, the paper has elaborated on colours’ faculty to evoke emotions by focusing on their cultural associations, which might have shaped those feelings like collective experiences with coloured objects or different definitions of colours. Here language becomes of great importance for the investigation. Besides, for the purpose of narrowing the context of disruption, imagined scenarios of disruption have been taken into account, allowing the concept of imagination to support the research. For this, the notions of the colours red and green have been explored in order to provide a deeper understanding of Ellsworth Kelly’s Red Green while considering the extent to which imagination plays a role in disruption. Then, the paper evidences the reciprocal relationship between language and imagination and reaches the conclusion that language ensures the continuation of society’s power structures. Nonetheless, it is suggested that language could be, at the same time, the tool that allows the creation of new imagined scenarios.","['Disruption', 'colour', 'imagination', 'language']"

Currently, there are two criteria to benefit from the EBA scheme. Firstly, the country must be listed as a 'Least Developed Country' by the UN Committee for Development Policy, and secondly, these preferences can be withdrawn if the respective country ceases to adhere to fundamental human rights and certain labor rights. In light of Myanmar's violence against the Rohingya people in Rakhine State described by the UN as 'a textbook definition of ethnic cleansing,' the question over what factors determine the EU’s decision to keep Myanmar in the EBA program arise. This thesis unveils processes in the Council that led to adopting this particular foreign policy decision by systematically analyzing insights from EU policy documents and by interviewing EU representatives, answering the question as to why the EU chose to keep Myanmar in the EBA program.","['European Union', 'CFSP', 'Intervention', 'Diplomacy', 'International Crisis', 'Crisis Mediation']"

US-China Hegemonic Tensions in Latin America: Panama's Balancing and Bandwagoning Dilemma,"Kappelle, Derk","['Valdivia Rivera, Soledad']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores Panama’s relations with the US and China, across history and more specifically in the 21st century, through a neorealist lens. Neorealist assumptions are applied to the case, and Panama’s bandwagoning and balancing strategies with the US and China are discussed as observed by historical trends and economic data such as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), trade (Panamanian exports and imports from/to the US and China), foreign aid statistics, bilateral agreements, and diplomatic statements by high officials on economic and security issues. The study finds that China’s hegemonic rise in Panama-China relations represents merely an indication of China’s potential to be a long-term hegemonic challenger to US hegemony, and does not signify a shift in hegemony. Panama is seen to balance and bandwagon with both the US and China, choosing alignment depending on the perceived economic gains involved and potential threats to survival. Panama balances with their long-standing ally and regional hegemon, the US, to foremost secure survival in the long-term while in the short-term Panama bandwagons with China for economic gains. Panama’s consideration of China as alternative to the US as a greater power for alignment demonstrates China’s hegemonic character in LAC. Nonetheless, this case study shows that the US maintains its primacy and superiority as a hegemon due to its strong historical ties and yet unrivaled economic and military capacity.","['US', 'China', 'Panama', 'Hegemony', 'Balancing', 'Bandwagoning', 'Latin America', 'Hegemonic tensions', 'Neorealism']"
Legitimacy Claims by Rebel Groups and Militias in Darfur,"De Bont, Daan","['Duyvesteyn, Isabelle']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigated the differences between the legitimacy claims of the Janjaweed militia and the JEM rebel movement during the Darfur conflict until the Darfur Peace Agreement in 2006. A framework containing three elements of legitimacy: norms, ideas, and actions was operationalized to explore the concept of legitimacy and the differences between the legitimacy claims of the Janjaweed and the JEM. The resulting analysis has shown that the traditional norms of legitimacy of both groups did not differ substantially. However, their ideas of legitimacy have shown many distinctions. These distinctions within the context of Darfur can be explained through several regional, national, and international processes which effected ethnic tensions in Darfur and influenced the ideas of legitimacy of both the JEM and the Janjaweed. The Janjaweed adopted a militarized Arab supremacist ideology and exhibited brutal violence along ethnic lines. The JEM on the other hand, rebelled against the marginalisation of the Darfur region by the ‘illegitimate’ GoS.","['Darfur', 'Legitimacy', 'Armed groups']"

In order to do so, this thesis will situate the debate into the current academic discussion and analyse the historical and current state of the Indian clothing industry. Based on a summative content analysis this thesis will pay special attention to informality and agency as key variables. This thesis discusses, to which extent the informality of the industry and the lack of agency of workers are limiting CSR effectiveness. This thesis identifies, the reproduction of the power of capital in a capitalistic system as an intervening variable and discusses its relationship with CSR. This thesis concludes, that informality and agency of the worker are contributing to the failure of CSR are however alone not able to explain it. It is argued, that as long as CSR operates within a capitalistic production system, which focusses mainly on the reproduction of capital instead of labour, it will be unable to reduce the vulnerability of the worker substantively.","['india', 'corporate social responsibility', 'clothing industry']"

Specifically, it explores the political impact of urban artistic practices in the popular struggle to end the impunity in the Argentina of the 80s and 90s. The thesis argues these practices have the potential to problematize the institutional narrative regarding what truth should be told about the last military dictatorship. As such, the thesis presents the close reading analysis of “silueteadas” and “señales viales”. These are two different modes of street art that were developed in Buenos Aires urban landscape during the last year of the dictatorship and the post dictatorship period, respectively.

The findings indicate that the UAE’s focus on improving its gains in the four pillars of education, innovation, ICT infrastructure and the institutional regime have yielded some progress over time. However, since the existing education system does not effectively address local obstacles on the national, institutional and cultural levels, the above-mentioned hurdles remain and continue to negatively affect the UAE’s journey toward becoming a KBE. As such, in accordance with the suggestions of key experts in education, it is important for the Emirati government to identify specific education-related challenges in order to address these local issues instead of focusing almost exclusively on global indicators.","['UAE Vision 2021', 'Knowledge Economy', 'Education', 'Local Challenges', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Global Indicators']"

The Serbian tradition of non-alignment in foreign affairs, its progress towards EU accession and warm relations with Russia make the country a very significant geopolitical intersection. For these reasons, the case of Chinese FDI in Serbia and its role in EU-Serbian accession negotiations is the central issue in this research. This thesis considers two central theoretical aspects: it considers whether and to what extent Chinese FDI in EU candidate countries is driven primarily by efforts to circumvent EU regulations and it considers arguments for Chinese FDI as an instigator for economic development and growth in Serbia. It employs a case study design that draws on directed content analysis, construing EU-Serbian relations as a particular case or instance of EU relations with EU candidate countries receiving FDI from China. The main finding of this research is that the role of Chinese FDI is dominated by several other issues that receive greater priority in EU-Serbian negotiations.","['FDI', 'BRI', 'China', 'EU', 'Serbia', 'circumvention', 'economic development', 'EU candidate countries']"

Its main functions include: Providing Chinese education and training to people from all walks of life, especially students in universities and colleges; carrying out Chinese examinations and Chinese teacher qualification services; providing information consultation on Chinese education, culture, economy and society, etc. Although the number of Confucius Institutes and Confucius Classrooms in Africa is not the largest, CIs in Africa cover more countries and regions than in other continents. In 2013, CIs aroused concerns and heated discussions about their hiring policy and ideology controversy. While some scholars have argued that CIs are tools to """"assimilate"""" and to """"brainwash"""" African students, criticisms are mainly related to funding sources, revenue distribution, faculty hiring requirements, academic viability, and ideology concerns. Since the CIs have attracted worldwide attention and have become an issue of intensive debate, they are frequently covered in both domestic and foreign mainstream media. As news report provided by news media is not unbiased and impartial but a kind of social practice, different news media, greatly affected by their political, ideological and social-cultural factors, may adopt various linguistic features to report the image of CIs and to influence the perception of the target audience. Thus, it is necessarily essential to explore the similarities and differences of news reports on CIs.","['Confucius Institutes', 'Critical Discourse Analysis', 'Swahili News Reports', 'Swahili Linguistic Features']"

This thesis investigates an understudied posture verb pattern in which a posture verb is combined with a complementive past participle, e.g. /zitten vastgeplakt/ 'lit. sit stuck: to be stuck' and /staan volgepriegeld/ 'lit. stand scribbled full: to be scribbled full'. Previous analyses disagree on the status of this pattern in terms of its productivity (is it fixed or are new combinations possible?), meaning (what does the pattern as a whole express?), and structure (is the complementive participle verbal or adjectival?). By examining over 6,000 attestations of the pattern in a corpus of written Dutch, this thesis evaluates these competing accounts, concluding that (i) the patterns are indeed productive; (ii) constraints on that productivity can be accounted for in terms of the meaning of the pattern as a whole, i.e. 'locativity' and 'resultativity'; and (iii) the pattern's syntax appears highly heterogeneous: some past participles behave like adjectives, others like verbs. Finally, I show that this heterogeneity is compatible with the semantic properties of past participles in general, and of the posture verb-participle pattern in particular.","['posture verbs', 'past participles', 'corpus linguistics', 'semantics', 'syntax', 'syntactic productivity', 'fixedness', 'locativity', 'resultativity', 'Dutch']"

"Beyond Progressive Aspect: On situational PPs, boundary effectuation and the Dutch preposition 'aan'","Bogaards, Maarten","['Boogaart, Ronny']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis is about Dutch prepositional phrases (PPs) headed by the preposition aan ‘on, at, to’, which generally denote locations, but are also regularly used in a ‘non-locational’ sense. Specifically, this thesis concerns the second, ‘non-locational’ group, which is termed ‘situational’ because on closer inspection, they do denote not locations but situations. These 'situational aan-PPs' have a fixed structure: the preposition aan, followed by a definite article, and finally either an infinitive, verb stem or a noun as aan's complement. The first pattern, paired with the verb zijn 'to be', has been characterized in previous work as a ‘progressive construction’. This raises two questions: what exactly is progressive aspect, and how do the different verbs and complements that occur in the situational aan-PPs differ conceptually from that analysis? To answer these questions, an attempt is made at teasing apart the concepts constitutive of ‘progressivity’. There turn out to be four core components: temporal decomposability, dynamicity, boundary effectuation by the subject, and non-gnomicity. Next, the possible verbs (e.g. zijn 'to be', gaan 'to go', krijgen 'to obtain') and complements (i.e. infinitive, stem and noun) are analyzed in terms of these four components. For the complements, the four components turn out to be sufficient to distinguish them semantically: all three of them may exhibit the full, quadripartite 'progressive cluster', but infinitives do not require the effectuation of boundaries, verb stems do not exclude gnomic interpretations, and nouns strictly impose neither of these restrictions. The three complements do impose, by definition, temporal decomposability and dynamicity, which can therefore be seen as situational aan-PPs’ conceptual core. Regarding the verbs, at least eight features are relevant, including decomposability and boundary effectuation, but also (among others) causativity, continuativity and modality. These properties are contributed by the verbs, which are thus to a greater or lesser degree compatible with the conceptual structure of each of the complements. The main outcome of this thesis is a more integrated and precise account of situational aan-PPs, making it possible to gain a broader understanding of the well-known progressive construction 'zijn aan het + infinitive'. That broader understanding also sheds some light on the way that the expression of aspect is organized in Dutch. This thesis adds to the impression that this organization may be more systematic than is generally assumed.","['theoretical linguistics', 'progressive aspect', 'control', ""'aan het infinitive'-construction"", 'Dutch', 'syntax-semantics interface', 'light nouns', 'productivity', 'situational PP', 'phasal aspect']"
To what extent does vocabulary and grammar learning aptitude predict accuracy measures in adult L2 speakers’ oral and written attainment?,"dos Santos Cunha, Claudia","['Jong, N.H. de']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the relationship between vocabulary and grammar learning aptitude (measured by two LLAMA subtests) and accuracy constituents in adult L2 speakers’ oral and written discourse productions. It also examines the relationship between the speaking and writing attainment, and the extent to which the link between performance in aptitude and speaking differs from the one for writing. Oral and written picture narratives elicited from 30 ESL speakers were analyzed and coded in terms of lexical and morphosyntactic errors per 100 words. The results of the Spearman correlation analyses revealed that vocabulary learning aptitude is significantly associated with the command of lexis and morphosyntax in writing, explicit grammar learning aptitude shows no significant association with accuracy in both production modes, and time availability in writing has no influence on the interplay between explicit and implicit knowledge with regard to the access of lexical forms. No significant differences were found with respect to the strength of aptitude-speaking and aptitude-writing relations.","['accuracy', 'CAF', 'explicit and implicit knowledge', 'language learning aptitude']"

California Roll-ing; The Perpetuation of Stereotypes of Japanese Cuisine Within The West,"de Jong, Alexander","['Veere, Henny van der']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since the Post World War Two era, Japanese gastronomic culture has steadily gained popularity, and has gained further popularity with the rapid interconnecting of cultures and economies around the world. This growth of cultural exchanges has resulted in many opening Japanese establishments outside of Japan. However, whilst such restaurants may serve Japanese dishes, the dishes they serve are, in many cases, stereotyped, presenting a different image of Japanese gastronomy. As a result, customers who are unaware of such misrepresentations assume such dishes are authentic, leading towards a perpetuation of stereotypes on Japanese cuisine. Thus, this paper looks in to the possible reasons why Japanese cuisine has been stereotyped outside of Japan, and the motivations that foster such misrepresentations. The paper begins with a brief historical look at the beginnings of the Japanese gastronomic stereotyping. Afterwards, the paper examines the concepts of globalization and orientalism as factors in creating misrepresentations. Lastly, the paper is rounded off by a short study conducted of Japanese restaurants in the United States, South America, and Europe, as a means of examining a third concept that aids in continuing such stereotypes.","['Japanese', 'Gastronomy', 'Stereotypes']"

This study, therefore, aimed to determine whether or not language proficiency of a speaker influences their patterns of phraseology use. 150 minutes of communications between air traffic controllers who were native speakers of English, and pilots that were either native or non-native speakers of English were collected, transcribed and coded.

"""One person's terrorist, another person's freedom fighter"": Russian decapitation efforts and its impact on the operational effectiveness of Chechen rebel groups","Look, Robert","['Bader, Max']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Despite the vast amount of scholarly attention, the issue of decapitation has enjoyed, research on decapitation has primarily focused on US and Israeli cases. Nonetheless, decapitation as a counterterrorism measure used by the Russian authorities, has been surprisingly under-researched. Hence, this paper aspires to contribute to the academic debate by filling this under-researched gap. Further building onto Morehouse’s work (2014), this paper presents an analysis of the impact of Russian decapitation efforts on the operational effectiveness of Chechen rebel groups for the period between 1995 and 2014. Central themes this study is concerned with involve the question of whether or not decapitation efforts have significantly and consistently reduced the number of casualties and subsequent attacks. This paper found that seen over the whole period of research, the number of casualties and the frequency of the attacks did decrease. Nevertheless, this decrease was accompanied by peaks and throughs, and, therefore, these decreases were not consistent.","['Russia', 'Chechen rebels', 'decapitation', '(counter) terrorism']"

Death in the City of Light: The Conception of the Netherworld during the Amarna Period,"Sofianou, Aikaterini","['Kaper, Olaf']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Amarna Period is one of the most controversial times in Egyptian history and is characterized by significant political, economic, religious, artistic and administrative changes. The most notorious controversy to modern eyes concerns Akhenaten's religious reforms and his vision of a """"monotheistic"""" theological system. These reforms led to a conflict between Atenism -the new religion- and traditional Egyptian beliefs. A matter that remains uncertain is how Atenism affected the conception of the afterlife during that period. The influence of the Aten's cult on the funerary art was crucial, and under Akhenaten's reign, many traditional funerary scenes, such as references to the Netherworld are absent. Additionally, the absence of Osiris, who was the central pylon of the traditional mortuary ideology, is a crucial modification that has spurred many interpretations concerning the way that afterlife was conceived after the pharaoh's reforms. Thus, the main focus of this thesis is to designate the conception of the Netherworld during the Amarna Period in the light of the absence of traditional funerary iconography and inscriptions.",

The Reparations Debate in the United States,"Hoogbergen, Jeanne","['Schmidli, William Michael']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"African Americans are in a continuous struggle for equality in America. The reparations debate, in which African Americans are searching for reparations for slavery and segregation that followed, may help create an equal society. In June 2019 the H.R.40 Bill was presented to Congress. This Bill advocates for a commission which will study the repercussions of slavery for African Americans and propose a suitable solution, in short the Bill is a blueprint for how to execute reparations. This thesis researched the historic reparations and the recent reparation debate. More specifically, this thesis aimed to answer the following question: “In what ways is the historical reparations debate incorporated in the current debate on reparations for African Americans searching for justice, and what does that mean for the significance of the current debate?” Based on the already existing historiography, this thesis took a qualitative research approach and draws upon primary and secondary sources to see how the historic debate has influenced the recent debate. Analysis of the primary sources showed that the historic debate is very much incorporated in the recent reparations debate. Furthermore, the reparations movement has never been stronger in its goal to create an equal society. However, the current reparations movement still left some questions unanswered such as who exactly would receive reparations, and who will pay for them.","['reparations debate', 'H.R. 40 Bill', 'United States', 'Slavery']"

Consuming Lolita Fashion,"Krom, Anna Maria","['Crandol, M.E.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis seeks out to explore the differences and similarities between how Japanese, Chinese and Western Lolitas consume the fashion. By using previous academic works on Lolita Fashion, accompanied by books magazines, blogs, posts on social media in various languages, the Japanese, Chinese and Western Loilta communities are exposed. Lolita fashion, which originates from Japan, has spread to countries all over the world. While in the first place the overseas communities tried to adapt Lolita in its “true form”, factors like local culture, aesthetics and availability has resulted in differences between the three regions. For example Japanese and Chinese Lolitas find model-influence more important than event-influence, while for Western Lolitas it is the other way around. As Western brands therefore also lay more of a focus on sales at events instead of hiring famous Lolita models for a photoshoot, this could be the reason why Western brands do not do it well in Japan and China. Chinese brands on the other hand do it well all over the world. Trends started by Chinese Lolitas are also being adapted in Japan. Chinese Lolitas even have gained so much influence that Japanese brands, which still carry a symbolic status in all the three Lolita communities, are adapting their sales to the wishes of Chinese Lolitas. It could therefore be concluded that while Japan is still the main source of influence in how Lolita fashion is consumed, China has become just as important in recent years. While Japan and China are reacting to each other, the West is merely adapting Japanese and Chinese influences to their local communities.",

The structure of the thesis is the following: Introduction which defines the goals and objectives of the paper; Literature Review which reviews existent scholarly articles on cronyism and cronyism in Russia; Three chapters that examine one of the prominent Russian billionaires, his connections to high ranked government officials and his alleged involvement in cronyistic exchanges; Conclusion with outlined findings and connection to the wider challenges that the world is facing. With the use of the existent theoretical framework on cronyism and triangulation of the available journalistic material, this thesis concludes that it is highly likely that cronyistic exchanges take place in Russia at the highest levels of the executive and legislative branches of the government. Coming to this conclusion is important because it reveals that the actions of the Russian government might not always be motivated by national interests but rather by the interests of certain individuals.","['Cronyism', 'Crony Capitalism', 'Corruption', 'Russia']"

A Battle between Reality and Imagination: The Uncanny and Symbolisms for the Ghosts in The Turn of the Screw and The Haunting of Hill House Series and Novel,"Joval, Jaylene","['Newton, Michael']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Ghosts are, of course, an integral part of ghost stories and their meanings entwine with the meaning of the story as such. Research has often focused on the appearance of the ghosts and how that feeds into the uncanniness of the story. However, ghosts are important in themselves and in terms of what they stand for and mean. Therefore, this thesis researches the ghosts and the uncanny feelings they provoke, arguing that their presence stands in the place of psychological disturbances in the protagonists. Moreover, I shall argue that they draw the audience inside the protagonists' uncertain and ambiguous perceptions. In this way, all three texts explore the conflict between subjective impressions and the objectively real, and they lead the reader or viewer into a state of fear and confusion regarding what is real or not. All three texts employ the ambiguous figure of the ghost in order to play with the nature of perception, and with our empathetic relationship to the main figure of a story. They aim to induce in the audience the same hesitation as to the truth of perceptions that haunt the protagonists themselves. As part of my methodology here, I draw upon Sigmund Freud’s theory of the uncanny to examine the disruption and haunting of perception in all three texts. I place the uncanny and that disruption in relation to how the text affects the audience.",

Media-Controlled Political Arenas: Shakespeare’s Coriolanus in Adaptation,"Jansen, Wierik","['Dijkhuizen, Jan Frans van']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The plays by Shakespeare have been adapted countless times. However, the original plays are often themselves based on other stories, or historical accounts. The history plays, for example, are written on the basis of historical accounts. In this sense, they are already adaptations in their own right. This makes any adaptation of one of his plays a double adaptation; an adaptation of an adaptation. This thesis will take this notion as its starting point. It will take a look at how Shakespeare used his sources in Coriolanus, and after analysing this play, two adaptations for the screen will be analysed, Ralph Fiennes 2011 film and Robert LePage’s 2019 stage adaptation. The focus of the analyses will be on which themes are emphasised in a particular adaptation, and how these themes are informed by the times in which the work was created. Fiennes and LePage move the political arena away from the speeches Shakespeare uses in his play. Instead, they create a modernised, media arena becomes the place where politicians fight for control over Rome.","['Shakespeare', 'Coriolanus', 'Adaptation', 'Adaptation Studies', 'Robert LePage', 'Film Adaptation', 'Ralph Fiennes']"

In this paper the fencing techniques and fencers of the seventeenth century are being discussed. Fencing manuals form this period often depict fencer running each other through with their rapiers. Furthermore, the way in which seventeenth century fencing master fencing seems to indicate that they are thinking of actual fights to the death. This begs the question of how seventeenth century fencing must be categorised. Was this a sport, a martial art or something entirely different all together? To answer this question this paper looks at the background of students that studied fencing at the Leiden fencing school, the reasons for people in the early modern age to carry swords. After this the fencing manuals of two fencing masters that taught and lived in Leiden are analysed to see what they deemed to be the use of fencing. Overall it can be concluded that the seventeenth century form of fencing could be used as a means for self-defence. Learning how to fence was also an essential part of a gentlemen’s education and a status symbol students perused eagerly.","['rapier', 'schermen', 'fencing', 'Leiden', 'zeventiende eeuw', 'gouden eeuw', 'Bruchius', 'Thibault', 'studentencultuur']"

Russian and American Strategy: Two sides of the same COIN,"Knoop, Julian de","['Skalamera, Morena']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Over the past decades a clear perception of dichotomy between the USA and the Russian Federation has persisted that has seeped into the perception of the strategy followed by either military. This perception is examined and challenged through an analysis of either nations strategy and tactics in the field of Counterinsurgency (COIN). Initial glances appear to confirm the perception by highlighting the difference in success rate and efficiency in COIN by Russia and the USA. Analyses of military COIN tactics in Syria and Iraq, the strategic political circumstances of either nation, and the ability of the individual militaries to adapt to circumstances as well as synthesize useful knowledge, are used to examine the reasons for the increased effectiveness of Russian COIN. Tactically, it is found that both nations do not differ enough to result in the marked difference in success that has been found, therefore the reasons must lie in the other circumstances. The results of this thesis have the implication that military success in COIN is not found in specific tactical differences but rather through a combination of maintaining political will and a better synthesis of useful knowledge within the scope of the military. Therefore, the US and Russian COIN strategies are two sides of the same COIN, albeit one more successful.","['Counterinsurgency', 'Politics', 'Russia', 'USA', 'Strategy']"
Private security contracting in peacebuilding missions: Militarizing humanitarian space,"Groot, Tom de","['Regilme, Salvador']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The market for private military and security companies (PMSCs) has expanded drastically since the end of the Cold War. Although PMSCs are highly controversial security providers (with Blackwater as the best-known example), these companies have become increasingly involved in UN peacebuilding. This prompts the question: Does the widespread use of PMSCs in UN peacebuilding enhance or undermine the effectiveness of peacebuilding missions? This study maintains that PMSCs have an innate tendency to harden (i.e. militarize) security risk management. They encourage humanitarian organizations to protect their personnel with barbed wired fences, security guards, protected convoys, and secure aid compounds, even if security risks are relatively low. This needlessly militarizes humanitarian space. Not only does it create a threatening environment around peace programs, it also increases physical and psychological barriers between humanitarian personnel and local communities. This disrupts the integration of interveners with their local environments and undermines some of the key requirements for effective peacebuilding.","['PMSCs', 'Peacebuilding', 'Securitization', 'Humanitarian space', 'Bunkerization', 'Security privatization', 'Local ownership', 'Security risk management']"

The Significance of Lapis Lazuli in Ancient Egyptian Art and Literature in Relation to the Emergence of Blue Glass in Eighteenth Dynasty Egypt,"Ayad Zaki, Sara","['Kaper, Olaf']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the New Kingdom Era, especially during the Eighteenth Dynasty period, a booming production and use of blue glass took place and seemed to have limited the use of lapis lazuli in ancient Egyptian art. One of the most famous examples to take into account is the golden funerary mask of Tutankhamun, which contains a mix of both blue paste glass and real lapis lazuli. Knowing that the lapis lazuli was very precious and very much used in ancient Egyptian history and that it was mostly brought to Egypt from Afghanistan via the Levant, the investigation raises several questions about the use of blue glass inlays instead of lapis lazuli. Therefore, this research has several objectives and will focus on the Eighteenth Dynasty period. The analysis will involve conceptual, textual and economical objectives. Conceptually, the research examines the significance of both lapis lazuli and blue glass in Ancient Egyptian art items. The textual goal underlines the significance of lapis lazuli and the color blue in ancient Egyptian religion and culture. And finally, the economical objective focuses on the causes behind the sudden production and use of blue glass.","['Eighteenth Dynasty', 'lapis lazuli', 'glass']"

Immortality is Commonplace: Documenting the Alpine flora in times of ecological instability,"Zibelnik, Ana","['Shobeiri, Ali']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"As we are currently witnessing what is often called the sixth mass extinction, photography is facing a new challenge. It can either respond with acting upon the “rescuist” impulse which often arises under such dark prospects (by keeping endangered species alive in the form of an image), or follow a more self-reflective path. In my written as well as visual research, I use lichens — the symbiotical growth of algae, fungus and bacteria — as a metaphor through which to explore the precarity of our environmental conditions. The resulting photograph which is normally said to “immortalise"" turns out to be a trap, as lichens become less likely to die as they grow older. This thesis aims to investigate how photographing extraordinarily durable organisms in times of ecological instability challenges the notion of photography as an embalming practice. It delves into the aesthetic implications of the current condition — joined under the term Anthropocene, by introducing the concepts of Timothy Morton’s “hyperobjects” and Tim Ingold’s “leaky things.” Subsequently, it scales up to the level of photography as a medium declared dead multiple times, often following major technological shifts. Here, extinction as an affective threat takes the place of such a disturbance, and, understood as a generative process, serves as the basis for speculating about the future of photography.","['Immortality', 'extinction', 'embalming', 'Anthropocene', 'lichens', 'symbiosis', 'hyperobjects', 'nonhuman photography', 'ecology']"

The unique status of Algeria made it so that it was legally part of France, the three départements of Oran, Alger and Constantine were all counted as French départements. Thus it seemed logical that law would be applied in Algeria as there would be no exceptions to any French territory at the time from the law. The application of the law in Algeria nevertheless sparked controversy as the context in which the law would operate was not the same as in France. The presence of an indigenous Muslim population and the dependency of the local Catholic Church on state subsidies raised concerns whether applying the law in Algeria was wise. The French administration in Algeria had also created a special form of hierarchised and centralised Islam with which the laic state could interact with and control. This was achieved through the control of the medersas, by censoring what was taught in these and the fatwas issued by the ulamas, and the recruitment of imams, ulamas and muftis which were proven to be apolitical and loyal to the French state. The Catholic Church in Algeria also served as an assimilative institution as many non-French European immigrants, from Catholic Countries such as Italy, Spain, Malta and Poland, came to Algeria. The application of the law in Algeria would on paper force the French authorities to give up the control they exerted over the unique form of Islam they had created in Algeria, but also give up the unofficial partnership with the Algerian Church with whom the colonial administration cooperated. The debate that originated in France and opposed Catholics and republicans made its way to Algeria and opposed these two ideological camps. What this thesis attempts to do through the analysis of newspaper articles, is to understand what the public opinion on this issue was in Algeria, to bring a nuanced perspective on the debate by highlighting differences within these two ideological camps, and differently from the scholarly literature adopt an approach not based on institutional archives.","['Republican', 'Catholic', 'Laïcité', 'Colonial', 'Algeria']"

Anders dan de bestaande literatuur legt het werkstuk niet de nadruk op de discussie over 'een nationale bouwstijl' en de politiekmaatschappelijke spanningen tussen protestanten en katholieken maar probeert het de problematische totstandkoming van het museum te verklaren vanuit een bestuurskundige benadering. De reconstructie van de debatten die in het parlement over de bouw van het Rijksmuseum tussen de agendering en de oplevering van het gebouw zijn gevoerd vormen de kern van dit onderzoek. Aan de hand van de Handelingen van de Tweede Kamer wordt optreden van de Kamer getoetst. Dit gebeurt via een chronologische verdeling in bouwfases.

Our Lungs or Their Forest? Ecological Imperialism and the Case of the Amazonian Forest Fires in Brazil,"Rook, Veerle","['Natermann, Diana']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the theory of ecological imperialism. The term eco-imperialism refers to a postcolonialist critique of environmentalist initiatives, as they are argued to portray imperialist characteristics. It claims that ideas from the Global North are imposed on the Global South, reinforcing their political and economic dominance. This thesis aims to test this theory on the case of the fires in the Brazilian Amazonian rainforest. Deforestation can be portrayed as a devasting process internationally, but at the same time, as progress and economic development locally. This discrepancy between local and international perspectives possibly portrays imperialist patterns. A critical discourse analysis is performed on international governmental and non-governmental sources covering these fires. This analysis aims to find proof of imperialist rhetoric. In addition, the Brazilian reaction to such discourse will be analyzed to strengthen this argument and find possible implications of current environmentalist discourse and counter-productive effects. The analysis finds numerous instances of discourse that point toward imperialist power relations in both governmental and non-governmental sources. However, especially NGOs repeatedly described the Amazon as being theirs and excluded local perspectives. With increasing international environmental attention and cooperation, it is important to ensure that initiatives are not counterproductive, and that equal agency is provided globally in order to guard itself from past mistakes in international interventions.","['ecological imperialism', 'postcolonialism', 'international environmentalism']"

The One with the Puns: Translation of Wordplay in Friends,"Bosch, Nikki van den","['Zeven, Katinka']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The translation of wordplay has been a well-discussed topic in the field of Translation Studies for years; for some it is an issue of “irresistible interest” (Newmark, 1978), for others not much more than a plain example of untranslatability, given the complications that inevitably arise when translating language that relies on the structural characteristics of the source text. This thesis set out to explore how this problem is approached in the subtitling of sitcoms, by analyzing the Dutch subtitles for wordplay passages in the American TV show Friends. In order to determine which translation methods were applied, this analysis used Delabastita’s model of wordplay translation methods (1993), which is originally designed for literary translation – this thesis therefore also aimed to investigate if this model is applicable to audiovisual translation and identified several of its shortcomings. Moreover, this study examined if restrictions specific to the medium of subtitling affect the (un)translatability of wordplay in sitcoms, pointing out that the visual context and the sitcom’s laugh track can be particularly restrictive factors. In general, the results of this study indicated that puns can be translated (i.e. a ST pun becomes a TT pun) in most cases but with a loss of translation quality and humoristic value as a possible consequence. Therefore, this study concluded that Delabastita’s model cannot be used for analyzing the translatability of puns in sitcoms without taking translation quality and humor into account.","['translation', 'wordplay', 'pun', 'audiovisual translation', 'translatability', 'AVT']"
Victimhood and State Identity: An Assessment of the Emotional Representation of Israel’s state Identity in the International Arena,"Schäfer, Paula","['Smith, Karen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Constructivism has introduced a new perspective on International Relations (IR) which emphasizes ideational factors for the formation of state interests. Similarly, the so called ‘Emotional Turn’ in IR advocates for an academic assessment of emotions in international politics and how the experience of feelings like humiliation, pride, anger shapes state behavior. This research aims to contribute to the Emotional Turn by proposing an academic assessment of the expression of victimhood as a dimension of a state’s identity using the case study of Israel. As IR theory is becoming more aware of ideational and emotional drivers of state action, conceptualizing victimhood in International Relations is an important endeavor. Victimhood is a social psychological concept describing a status or identity that the victim ascribes to themselves after suffering trauma. What are the emotional categories underlying a self-ascribed victimhood in Israel’s identity discourse towards international community? The methodological assessment employs Emotions Discourse Analysis to identify the categories and connotations of victimhood uttered in the speeches of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in his Annual Addresses to the UN General Assembly from 2015 to 2017. Understanding the emotional component of identity markers such as victimhood might offer policy makers new ways of reconciling ongoing conflicts and add to the ongoing debate on the impact of emotions in International Relations and discourse analysis.","['Emotions Discourse', 'Israel', 'Netanyahu', 'United Nations General Assembly', 'Speech', 'Victimhood']"

JAPANESE ODA IN MYANMAR: An exploration of aid practices and how they relate to social development,"Carlotta, Costa","['Shibata, Saori']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Aid practices are often not leading to inclusive human development. Research has shown that recipient countries face challenges to foster social progress, which is here to be understood as aggregate improvement of income, health status, and freedoms of the population. The challenges are often stemming from ineffective financial allocation of capital. This often forms the foundation for experts’ criticism of the effectiveness of aid efforts. Official Development Assistance (ODA), for example, can be deemed to be one form of partially ineffective aid practice. This study aims at identifying the causal mechanisms, triggered by ODA disbursements, that hinder social development. More specifically, the case of Japanese ODA in Myanmar shall be the focus of this study. Building on existing work, this paper asks: to what extent is Japanese ODA contributing to social progress in Myanmar? Based on an in-depth case study analysis of the Thilawa Special Economic Zone, this study seeks to demonstrate how the Japanese ODA project has not been successfully contributing to social development in Myanmar. The assessment of the results illustrated that the enhancement of human capabilities, understood with the Capability Approach developed by Amartya Sen, has not been verified.","['Official Development Assistance', 'Japan', 'Myanmar', 'Capability Approach']"

"It is Left, Right? A Study on Linguistic Interference and Inhibitory Control in Late Language Learners","Halkema, Myke Marica","['Schiller, Niels']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Speaking, reading, writing and understanding two languages – better known as bilingualism – has been a common trait among people that live in countries with two national languages (e.g., Dutch and French in Belgium). Today, bilingualism is an increasingly common phenomenon due to globalization, growing transnational migration and open borders (Abutalebi & Weekes, 2014). From an academic perspective, bilingualism has become an emerging topic in the field of (psycho)linguistics. Over the past decades, researchers have been focused on examining language processing mechanisms in bilinguals as opposed to monolinguals (e.g., Blumenfeld & Marian, 2011; Bialystok et al., 2008). A rationale for this, is that the presence of two languages provide us more detailed language and cognitive models, which in turn inform our understanding of how languages work and vice versa (Kroll et al., 2012). An important insight in bilingual language processing, for example, is that both languages are simultaneously active, independently of the language of the task (e.g., Colomé & Miozzo, 2010; Hermans et al., 2011). This parallel activation results in competition between the two languages (linguistic interference), which suggests that bilinguals can supress (inhibitory control) the irrelevant language (e.g., Hermans et al., 2011; Marian & Spivey, 2003). A growing body of research found evidence that early bilinguals (i.e., earlyage bilingual acquisition) have stronger inhibitory control skills compared to monolinguals (e.g., Blumenfeld & Marian, 2011; Bialystok et al., 2008). However, much less research has been done on task performance in late language learners (i.e., learning a new language after native language acquisition and at an older age). Early bilinguals, who constantly have to control interference from two competing languages and have done so their whole life, differ a great deal from late language learners, who have done so less than early bilinguals as they are still in the middle of the process of learning a new language (Festman and Münte, 2012). 3 In the present study, I aimed to shed light on linguistic interference and inhibitory control processes in late language learners. In the following sections, I will first discuss early versus late bilingualism and how both groups are reflected in different models of bilingual processing. Then, I will explain bilingualism in light of parallel activity, linguistic interference, inhibitory control and Stroop performance. Next, I will outline the current study and research questions, after which the methodology is presented. Lastly, I will reveal the results, elaborate on implications for the present study, discuss suggestions for future research and give a small conclusion.","['bilingualism', 'late language learners', 'linguistic interference', 'inhibitory control', 'language proficiency', 'linguistic distance']"

"Khomeini, The Islamic Philosopher","Smits, Yannick","['Bdaiwi, A.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this dissertation, I set forth an analysis and interpretation of Khomeini's 'Lectures on Surat Al-Fatiha,' broadcasted after the 1979 Revolution. In the 'lectures,' Khomeini argued in favour of a philosophical rationale that justified his main political doctrine, the 'guardianship of the jurist.' As I discuss, this justification hinges upon the intellectual differentiation between individual human beings and the envisaged hierarchy of truth that characterizes the different Islamic disciplines. Albeit Islamic law is lower than Islamic philosophy, it is necessary, as most human beings cannot foster their philosophical perfection without an Islamic jurist guarding over them. This understanding enables us to epitomize Khomeini as an Islamic philosopher, a claim I strengthen by comparing the 'lectures' to Avicenna's political philosophy. Despite their differences, their political philosophies resemble each other more than might seem and an understanding of Avicenna’s political philosophy furthers our understanding of the relationship between Islamic law and Islamic philosophy in Khomeini’s thinking. Doing so, I argue that the main doctrine of Khomeini’s legalist reading of Islam, the ‘guardianship of the jurist,’ must be subordinated to his understanding of the philosophical perfection of the human being, thereby illustrating his conceptual closeness to the Islamic philosophical tradition.","['Khomeini', 'Avicenna', 'Islamic Philosophy', 'Islamic Government', 'Lectures on Surat Al-Fatiha']"

De onderzoeksvraag luidt: Hoe worden de vluchtelingen gerepresenteerd in de twee Nederlandse prentenboeken Amira: de prinses komt thuis en Op de vlucht? Daarbij zijn de volgende deelvragen gesteld: Krijgt de vluchteling een stem? Nodigen de prenten en de tekst de lezer uit tot identificatie met het hoofdpersonage? Wordt de vluchteling gerepresenteerd als een autonoom individu of als slachtoffer? Voor de beantwoording van deze vragen is gebruik gemaakt van een multimodale tekstuele analyse (close-reading) en een representatieanalyse. In de beide prentenboeken worden vluchtelingen enerzijds gerepresenteerd als autonome menselijke personages, die de ruimte krijgen om hun eigen verhaal te vertellen. Daarnaast kan de lezer zich met hen identificeren. Anderzijds wordt het beeld van de vluchteling als passief slachtoffer bevestigd door de nadruk die wordt gelegd op het verlies en wordt de vluchteling geobjectiveerd. Beide prentenboeken hebben een empathisch vermogen en nemen een kritische houding in.

Sociaal-economische motieven van kloppen in de noordelijke-Nederlanden, (1580 – 1650)","Versmissen, Rosalie","['Schmidt, Ariadne']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Recentelijk is er binnen de historiografie onderzoek verricht naar de sociaal-economische motieven Van begijnen in de lage landen. Beargumenteerd werd dat begijnen niet alleen om religieuze redenen voor het semi-religieuze leven kozen, maar dat het begijnenleven vrouwen tevens een mogelijkheid bood om niet te huwen maar wel beschermd te zijn. Aan de hand Van 231 levensverhalen Van de Haarlemse klopjes ben ik na gegaan of dit ook bij klopjes Van toepassing was. Klopjes waren, net zoals begijnen, semi-religieuze katholieke vrouwen. Ze verdwenen niet zoals kloosterzusters achter de muren Van het klooster, maar bleven functioneren in de stedelijke samenleving. Voorheen is binnen de geschiedschrijving alleen op de religieuze kant Van het kloppenleven gefocust. Met deze scriptie beoogde ik meer aandacht te geven aan de wereldlijke kant Van het kloppenleven.De levensverhalen Van de Haarlemse klopjes geven inzicht in de keuze Van de vrouwen. Een kloosterleven in de Zuidelijke Nederlanden was niet uitgesloten en de beschrijvingen laten zien dat de vrouwen kozen voor het kloppenbestaan boven het huwelijk. Dit toont aan dat de keuze om in te treden tot de kloppengemeenschap een bewuste keuze was Van de vrouw zelf. Verdere analyse Van de levensbeschrijvingen toont aan dat een groot deel Van de taken niet religieus waren. Kloppen werkten voor hun levensonderhoud en stonden hierdoor midden in de stedelijke samenleving. Daarnaast zorgden de kloppengemeenschap voor een vangnet waarbij huur werd verdeeld en arme en zieke vrouwen werden opgevangen. De gemeenschap bood vrouwen bescherming tegen de armoedeval waar veel ongehuwde vrouwen voor moesten vrezen. Uit de levensbeschrijvingen blijkt tevens dat de vrouwen contacten met familieleden konden onderhouden en daarnaast hun eigen bezittingen konden behouden. Door de grote mate waarin de kloppen in ‘deze wereld’ bleven en het vangnet dat de gemeenschap hen bood, zijn sociaal-economische motieven in de keuze voor het kloppenbestaan niet uitgesloten.",
Bridging the Gap between Descriptive and Normative Ethics: An Exploration of the Bhagavad Gita in Light of American Pragmatism,"Mantov, Jordan","['Berger, Douglas']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this thesis I argue that the Bhagavad Gita exhibits the characteristics of what I call an ‘entanglement’ moral theory i.e. a theory which rejects the fact/value dichotomy and the descriptive/normative dichotomy. In section 1, I begin by explicating both the fact/value dichotomy and the descriptive/normative dichotomy. I characterize the former as containing the latter. Afterwards, I draw attention to the fact that while mainstream philosophy has accepted fact/value entanglement, its moral variant – descriptive/normative entanglement has been ignored by mainstream moral philosophy. In section 2, I seek to characterize the three paths which have largely been acknowledged to contain the teachings of the Gita. In section 3, I argue that the Gita acknowledges fact/value entanglement and descriptive/normative entanglement. The former is a presupposition of moral action and this can be seen by the relationship between the path of knowledge and the path of devotion. The latter is made explicit in the relationship between svabhava and svadharma. I conclude the thesis by discussing the limitations of the Gita as an entanglement theory.","['Normative Ethics', 'Descriptive Ethics', 'Fact Value Dichotomy', 'Bhagavad Gita', 'American Pragmatism', 'Descriptive Normative Entanglement']"

Object Omission & Verb Use in English Language Recipes,"Meetsma, Mabel","['Lipták, Anikó']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Recipes belong to the abbreviated register, a categorisation of varieties of non-standard language use which displays an abbreviated or simplified form of the standard language use, like newspaper headlines and instructions. Recipes fall under the practical text type within abbreviated registers, which have the function of describing a method of preparation of a dish. To be most functional, they need to be as easy to follow as possible. One of the most striking differences between the normative language and the language used in recipes is the omission of objects. Object omission is able to take place in recipes because the reader is aware of the missing object from the context. The omitted direct object maintains its status as a topic even though it is not explicitly mentioned. The verb type can determine whether a direct object is required: if the verb is transitive, it can prove the existence of a direct object. In order to give a more detailed description of object omission in relation to the verb type, this thesis provides an in-depth analysis of the relation between transitive verbs and their direct objects in fifty English language recipes.","['abbreviated register', 'imperative form', 'language use in recipes', 'object omission', 'register variation', 'topicality', 'transitive verbs']"

An Examination of the Status of Minority and Regional Languages through the prism of Economic and Political Power,"Herlihy, Daniel","['Valk, John-Harmen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Language is a topic that has been routinely manipulated and contested in the political arena. It was a significant tool during the colonial era and has also acted as a force for social unity among divided peoples. Major empires have succeeded in subjugating the conquered by imposing their own language. This has led to minoritisation of languages that were once widely spoken in certain countries and regions. In the era of postcolonialism and multiculturalism, language continues to be a battleground where old fears and rivalries play out. In Western Europe, there are a range of official attitudes towards minority and regional languages. These attitudes are generally reflected in the status given (or not) to such languages by the governments in the affected countries. There is a lack of comparative work in the field at present, with most scholars focusing on individual cases. Through both positive (Republic of Ireland and Spain) and negative (Northern Ireland and Franco-era Spain) cases, this paper will show how economic and political power play a crucial role in preserving minority languages.","['Languages', 'Power', 'Politics', 'Economics']"
"""Het Russisch geluk ontraadseld"": Het verschil tussen счастье en радость","Behram, Lejla","['Stapert, Eugenie']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Russische Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Wat is het verschil tussen radost’ en sčast’e? Het lijkt vanzelfsprekend dat het een ‘vreugde’ is en het andere ‘geluk’. Maar waar zit het verschil nou precies in? In dit onderzoek zal hier op verschillende manieren naar gekeken worden. In de literatuurstudie wordt er naar meerdere artikelen gekeken, die de twee woorden behandelen. Uit deze literatuurstudie blijkt dat het verschil zit in het feit dat radost’ een gevoel is en sčast’e een staat. Dit verschil bestaat uit verschillen in de componenten van de duur, de intensiteit en de concreetheid van het gevoel. Daarnaast zou volgens de literatuurstudie sčast’e over een apart component beschikken, namelijk een connectie met sud’ba. Om dit te testen werd een corpusonderzoek gehouden: 50 voorbeelden van ieder gevoel worden geanalyseerd op de componenten. Hieruit blijkt dat de duur en intensiteit niet van veel belang zijn. Hier wordt ook aangetoond dat hoewel sčast’e zeker een connectie heeft met sud’ba, is het mogelijk om te zeggen dat radost’ in enkele mate dit component ook bevat. Vervolgens zijn er gesprekken met moedertaalsprekers van het Russisch gehouden als tweede test. Hieruit is echter gebleken dat het verschil tussen radost’ en sčast’e voor moedertaalsprekers toch zit in de duur en intensiteit van de gevoelens: radost’ is van kortere duur, sčast’e is van langere duur en is een sterker gevoel. Hieruit blijkt dus toch dat radost’ een gevoel van kortere duur is en dat sčast’e een staat is, waar de connectie met sud’ba duidelijker is.","['Blijdschap in het Russisch', 'Corpusonderzoek', 'Semantiek', 'Moedertaalsprekers']"

Bill Clinton: The Legacy of His Foreign Policy,"Meijer, Alannah","['Heere, Cees']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"When looking at the relationship between the U.S. and Russia one can see that since the fall of the Soviet Union it has been a tense one. It seems as though both countries have never understood each other, culturally, politically and economically. With the alleged 2016 meddling of Russia in U.S. elections the mistrust towards Russia has risen to an all-time high. This thesis aims to provide an analysis of the Clinton Administration which can be used as lessons for future administrations. First a small overview of the development of the relationship between the U.S. and Russia will be provided. It will then proceed to look at the role of NATO expansion within the development of the relationship between both countries, during the critical time-period after the fall of the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the personal relation between President Clinton and Russia, as well as President Yeltsin, will be examined to indicate how Clinton tackled the opportunity of starting to build a solid relationship between the U.S. and Russia. By concluding with a case study on Bosnia this thesis aims to show how different interests can lead to a conflicting relationship, leading to the fact that there are still lessons that can be learned from history.","['U.S.-Russia Relations', 'Bill Clinton', 'NATO', 'Foreign Policy']"

Understanding Suicide as Reflected in Suicide Notes: A Critical Assessment of Research Methodology in Text-Based Research,"Boersma, Alex","['Fonteyn, Lauren']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The suicide note is a piece of text that often evokes emotional reactions within the reader, as it contains elements that are heavily personal. These feelings can be so “complex or overpowering” that they “may require reflection and interpretation” (Boden, Gibson, Owen, and Benson, 2016). Boden et al. examined that “researchers will engage in some form of reflexivity, but fewer will examine how their feelings influence their analysis” (p. 1081). Feelings as a component of research is just an example of why qualitative research on the suicide note is important and necessary, as current research on this subject has mostly been quantitative. For instance, current research has shown that linguistic analysis of suicide notes can lead to a broader understanding of the suicidal mind, as “suicidal individuals are more self-focused, express more negative emotion and sometimes use more death-related words” (Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010). However, the question is whether mere quantitative research is expedient enough to broaden our understanding of suicide, as purely quantitative methods lead to generalised results, which is undesirable (Stack & Rockett, 2018). In my thesis, I will review the relevant literature on how the suicide note as a text type is researched and argue that qualitative components should be incorporated in quantitative research to broaden our understanding of suicide.","['suicide', 'suicide notes', 'qualitative research', 'quantitative research', 'methodology']"

"Memory Politics in Sixteenth-century Scotland: Reformation, rebellion and rewriting the past","Pont, Johanna Cornelia","['Steen, J.A. van der']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"In early modern Europe, authority was often legitimated by the antiquity of an institution or practice. The past played an important part in the self-fashioning of rulers, and vice versa posed a problem for people trying to change or replace ancient institutions.In this context historians have coined the term ‘memory wars’, as memories become arguments justifying present actions. While the role of memory politics, aimed at remembering as well as forgetting, has been studied in the civil wars in the Low Countries and France, this has not been done for a similar conflict in Scotland. This points to a problem in the study of memory politics in early modern Europe, which is mostly based on progressive polities as France and the Low Countries. This is problematic because modernity is a point of contention among scholars studying memory practices.To overcome a possible distortion of early modern memory practices by relying on relatively ‘modern’ polities, it is necessary to compare the practices in these polities with memory practices in an early modern polity which was less developed, such as Scotland. Are economic prosperity and state formation, or a certain level of development, prerequisites for ‘modern’ memory practices?","['Scotland', 'Mary Stewart', 'Reformation', 'Memory Politics', 'Rebellion', 'James Stewart', 'Broadside ballad', 'Modernity', 'Early modern Europe', 'Civil war']"

Reading and the Distracted Brain: An Exploration of how the Graphic Narrative Can Contribute to Improve General Reading Skills and Reading Enthusiasm for Long-Form Text Reading,"Vries, Sam de","['Weel, Adriaan van der']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Never before were there so many people that can read and have access to reading material on demand. This is a time of great technological innovation, and carrying a small computer in the back pocket of your jeans has become a normality, and often even a necessity. An increasing number of people relies on the ability to read, and current literacy numbers are exceptionally high, with a vast majority of the world population being literate. Reading is done on a large scale by a staggering number of people, yet reading enthusiasm and the number of people who read as a leisure activity in its own right is declining. This results in a decline in the number of people able to read a long-form text in the deep reading mode, and this poses a problem. Reading long-form texts in a deep reading mode trains the reading comprehension ability and general reading skill, if these skills are not regularly trained there is a risk of becoming low-literate, which impedes someone to fully participate in society. Being low-literate decreases the chances of being able to think critically, differentiate between real and fake news, understand political party programmes, or the information attached to drugs. The increase of people at risk of becoming low-literate is connected to heavy screen use. Screen reading does not train the deep reading mode, but rather the skimming reading mode. Being well trained to read in the skimming reading mode has made it extremely difficult for people to be able to read long-form texts. In this thesis I address this problem and argue that reading graphic narratives can be a stepping stone to acquiring and improving general comprehensive reading skills and reading enthusiasm for non-graphic text. I support my argument by indicating the characteristics of the graphic narrative and how these enable the reluctant reader to read a graphic narrative in a way that resembles the skimming reading mode, while still being able to read deeply. Additionally I review several research studies that have found the graphic narrative to provide a positive learning experience for students, in the fields of second language acquisition, and reading comprehension ability.","['Reading-enthusiasm', 'graphic novel', 'comic', 'graphic narrative', 'leesbevordering', 'reading']"
The EU-Russian Gas Partnership: A Match Made in Heaven or an Unnatural Union? An Analysis of how the divergence between EU and Russian economic paradigms impacts EU-Russian gas relations,"Burtscher, Alexander","['Skalamera, Morena']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since the inception of the Russian Federation and European Union, gas tensions in the European gas market have gradually increased to the point where the EU and Russia have become entangled in several legal, economic, and political confrontations. An analysis of Russian and EU policies supports Constructivist assertions that ideas influence the decision-makers and policies involved in these confrontations. More specifically, an in-depth analysis of EU and Russian policies, strategic discourses, and policy environments reveals that EU-Russian gas tensions are correlated with an EU-Russian divergence in worldviews, goals, and tools. Once this observation is adapted to Hall’s theory of policy paradigms and fitted into a Constructivist framework, EU-Russian gas tensions appear to be driven by EU-Russian differences in economic paradigms. A thorough analysis of one of the longest-lasting and most explicit EU-Russian legal confrontations – the European Commission’s antitrust proceedings against Gazprom – lends support to this hypothesis. Over the course of this six-year-long legal battle, EU-Russian gas tensions increased whenever the divergence between the economic paradigms of the EU and Gazprom increased. Likewise, tensions decreased once their divergence decreased. This correlation is reinforced by the fact that the diverging EU and Russian economic paradigms have inspired conflicting policies that fuel these EU-Russian gas tensions. Thus a causal relationship between EU-Russian differences in economic paradigms and EU-Russian gas tensions seems to have been verified. This causal relationship has great implications for EU and Russian policies alike, for it questions common assumptions that EU-Russian gas tensions will automatically decrease once there is a political change.","['Russia', 'EU', 'EU-Russian gas relations', 'gas trade', 'constructivism']"

In order to counter global warming and climate change, renewable energy is regarded as the key driver. Despite an abundance of renewable energy resources in Indonesia, the country has only marginally seen growth in this sector. The purpose of this research is to examine why Indonesia has been reluctant to transition towards renewable energy by taking the nexus of economic growth and (renewable) energy into account, as well as the various stakeholders that are related to Indonesia’s renewable energy sector. Using qualitative research methods, this study analyses Indonesia as a case study in order to effectively comprehend this multidimensional issue. It closely aligns with the assemblage theory in order to create a better understanding of various interests, fractions, rivalries, synergies and contradictions between the stakeholders in Indonesia’s renewable energy sector. Powerful stakeholders that have demote renewables, political ‘short-termism’ and social factors (that have negative effects on inflows of FDI) were found to play the greatest obstacles in facilitating the transition towards renewable energy development. Furthermore, this study adds to the debate regarding renewable energy development and economic growth.","['Renewable Energy', 'Indonesia', 'Economic growth', 'Transition', 'Sustainability']"

Uit de bronnen komt een versnipperd beeld naar voren, waarbinnen positieve en negatieve ervaringen elkaar afwisselen, hoewel er wel degelijk enkele patronen te ontdekken zijn. Deze versnippering is grotendeels te verklaren door de grote regionale variabiliteit in de Indonesische Archipel, die onder de Nederlandse militairen voor sterk uiteenlopende ervaringen zorgde. Desondanks lijken er ten minste twee factoren te zijn die een trend veroorzaken in de houding van Nederlandse militairen ten aanzien van civiel-militaire samenwerking, namelijk de fase van de oorlog waarin de observatie werd gedaan en de etniciteit van de samenwerkingspartner.","['Indonesische onafhankelijkheidsoorlog', 'Civiel-militaire samenwerking', 'Egodocumenten', 'Dagboeken', 'Militaire geschiedenis', 'Nederlands-Indië', 'Counter-insurgency', 'Dekolonisatie', 'Politionele Acties']"
Renewable Energy: A Potential Pathway Towards Alleviating the Resource Curse,"Tryland, Torstein","['Skalamera, Morena']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyses how Angola and The UAE can utilize renewable energy to limit their dependence toward their fossil fuel sectors. The thesis maps out these countries relative dependene by utilizing two typologies developed by IRENA. Firstly, the high exposure and low resilience category. These countries are defined as dependent on fossil fuel incomes, which account for more than 20% of GDP, while also lacking the fiscal and political instruments to alter their dependence. Secondly, the high exposure and high resilience category, defined as countries dependent on fossil fuel incomes, which account for more than 20% of GDP, but with the necessary income and capacity to manage the transition. This thesis concludes that the transition towards renewable energy is both an important and necessary tool for countries to limit their dependence on fossil fuels and promote economic diversification. The two case studies outlined highlight an emphatic case of how countries with various financial, as well as institutional and political capacities, can utilize these technologies effectively.","['Energy', 'Renewable Energy', 'Resource Curse', 'Energy Nationalism']"

This thesis aims to argue that the authors of these two works use specific rhetorical tactics in an attempt to incentivize their readers into action to combat their respective concerns: slavery and the implementation of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1851 in Uncle Tom’s Cabin, and the inhumane work-and living conditions surrounding the meatpacking industry in Chicago in the early 1900s in The Jungle. By close reading, analyzing, and comparing the two works the mutual themes were determined as follows: slavery, children, animals, and religion. Additionally, the theme of motherhood will be applied to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, while the immigrant theme will be discussed with regards to The Jungle. Both novels argue their points with a combination of these sympathy- and empathy garnering themes, which are then strengthened by interjections of an omniscient narrator that serves as the mouthpiece for Stowe and Sinclair.","['political change', 'empathy', 'compare']"

The regional economic and political effects of the EU-ACP Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) in the ECOWAS and SADC countries,"Brunner, Filippo","['Van Riel, Bart', 'Šćepanović, Vera']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The EU-ACP relationship is very old and has developed much over time. After three trade disputes at the WTO level, the unilateral trade preferences that ACP countries enjoyed under the Cotonou Agreement, ceased to exist in 2008. Therefore, regional Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) between the EU and several groupings of the ACP countries were meant to enter into force to ensure continued economic cooperation between the EU and the ACP. Furthermore, the EU envisioned the EPA agreements to further strengthen the regionalisation processes within the African continent. However, the EPA negotiations have proven to be very difficult since only 4 out of 7 regional EPAs have come into force. This comparative case study takes a regionalist approach and focusses on the political and economic effects that the implementation of the SADC EPA and the two West African stepping stone EPAs with Ghana and the Ivory Coast have had on the ECOWAS and SADC countries. In particular, the author has analysed UNCTAD trade and investment statistics and has conducted interviewees with African regional experts and EU officials. The results show that the EPA agreements do support deeper regional economic and political integration among the African EPA member states. However, due to the different composition of the EPA groupings and the already existing African Regional Economic Communities (RECs), the implementation of the EPAs have hindered the integration process of both the ECOWAS and SADC projects.","['EU-ACP EPAs', 'West Africa EPA', 'SADC EPA', 'Regionalism', 'EU-Africa relationship', 'EU - Africa trade and investments']"

Carmen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The aim of this study is to improve our understanding of code-switching (CS) at conflict sites (where the grammars of two languages have conflicting rules). We examine Determiner-Noun-Adjective switches produced by Kaqchikel-Spanish bilinguals. Both languages differ in gender and word order: (i) Spanish has gender, Kaqchikel does not, and (ii) the adjective in Spanish is normally postnominal while in Kaqchikel it is prenominal (Bosque & Picallo, 1996; Brown, Maxwell & Little, 2006) (see examples 1 & 2, respectively). (1) Spanish: la casa roj-a def. .art fem house red-fem ‘The red house’ (2) Kaqchikel: ri käq jay def.art red house ‘The red house’ Predictions on mixed nominal constructions (NCs), based on two theoretical approaches, the Matrix Language Frame model (MLF) (Myers-Scotton, 2002) and the Minimalist Program (MP) (Chomsky, 1995, 2000) are examined. Both approaches provide contrasting predictions regarding the language of the determiner and adjective position. The MP predicts that (i) the determiner language is provided by the language with the ‘richest array of grammatical features’ (Liceras, Spradlin & Fernández Fuertes, 2005; Moro Quintanilla, 2014) and (ii) the adjective language dictates the relative order of the adjective with respect to the noun (Cantone & MacSwan, 2009). The MLF model predicts that (i) the determiner language is provided by the Matrix Language (ML) of the clause, and (ii) the ML dictates the relative order of the adjective with respect to the noun. Previous studies, both based on naturalistic and experimental data, report different outcomes when examining the prediction accuracy of the two approaches for language of the determiner and adjective position in different language pairs (e.g. Herring, Deuchar, Parafita Couto & Moro Quintanilla, 2010; Parafita Couto & Gullberg, 2017; Blokzijl, Deuchar, Parafita Couto, 2017, Fairchild & Van Hell, 2015; Parafita Couto, Deuchar & Fusser, 2015; Stadthagen-González, Parafita Couto, Parraga & Damian, 2017; Balam & Parafita Couto, 2019; Pablos, Parafita Couto, Boutonnet, De Jong, Perquin, De Haan & Schiller, 2019). In the present study, a total of 277 mixed NCs were elicited from 20 Kaqchikel-Spanish bilinguals through a Director-Matcher task (Gullberg, Indefrey & Muysken, 2009). Results show that (i) the determiner always appeared in Kaqchikel, supporting the predictions of the MLF (because the ML was always Kaqchikel) but not the MP, (ii) the adjective always occurred in postnominal position. In 164 out of 174 cases, the adjective language was Kaqchikel. This postnominal position was not predicted by any of the theoretical approaches. In monolingual Kaqchikel nominal constructions in this task, the adjective also occurred predominantly in postnominal position. Possible explanations for this can be drawn upon recent studies that report a task-effect (Bellamy, Parafita Couto & Stadthagen-González, 2018).","['code-switching', 'nominal domain', 'adjective', 'determiner', 'noun', 'matrix language frame', 'minimalist program', 'spanish', 'kaqchikel', 'nominal contructions']"

Exposing India's rise as a global emitter and its new capacity to act on climate change, I evaluate the validity of this country's exemption from binding commitments granted at the first UNFCCC Conference of Parties (in Rio de Janeiro, 1992) and reflected in the Kyoto Protocol. Annexes to the Protocol allocated binding targets for emissions reductions to developed countries (“Annex 1”) and an exemption from compulsory environmental action for less developed and emerging ones (“Non-Annex”). The division was based on each Party's cumulative emissions and capacity to act; in India's case, both have changed sensibly since the '90s. The empirical chapter confirms a growing external pressure from other countries for India to adopt new commitments. UNFCCC Parties recognised the necessity to include India into a new post-Kyoto Protocol regime for global climate policy to be successful in the coming decades. On the other hand, India's geographical vulnerability to the harmful consequences of global warming put the government under internal pressure to step up environmental action.","['India', 'Climate policy', 'UNFCCC', 'Green diplomacy', 'Climate debt', 'Global warming', 'Climate change', 'CO2 emissions']"
Ecological Sustainability and the Chinese Belt and Road Project: An assessment of Strong Sustainability within the Standard Gauge Railway projects in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Zijderveld, Anoek","['Shibata, Saori']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The concept of Sustainable Development is increasingly used in development policies. Still, it remains questionable whether sustainable development is feasible in reality. Since a few years, China aims to be leading in sustainable development. Their Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) could secure that leading role at a global scale. Nonetheless, many scholars argue that this project is far from sustainable. Others refute this criticism and state that the BRI has the most potential for sustainable development. This thesis aims to investigate this debate by answering the following question: To what extent is ecologically sustainable development implemented within the Chinese BRI Railroad projects in Sub-Saharan African Countries? A qualitative data analysis (small-N) will answer this question. The conditions of sustainable development will be compared to practice by studying three railroad projects. This thesis will view sustainable development through an ecological lens with a focus on Strong Sustainability. This thesis analyses how the projects relate to the criteria of Strong Sustainability: protecting and promoting biodiversity, sustainable water management and carbon emission reductions. The results show that the SGR projects do attribute to the Sustainable Development Goals. Still, they could have done more to make the project genuinely sustainable; a lot of environmental concerns remain unaddressed within the projects. Therefore, these projects cannot be labelled as ecologically sustainable under the criteria of Strong Sustainability.","['China', 'Africa', 'Sustainability', 'SGR-trains', 'BRI', 'Strong Sustainability', 'Infrastructure', 'Kenya', 'Djibouti', 'Nigeria']"

France suffered a humiliating defeat in 1940; however, it managed (thanks to the allies) to end up in the side of victors. Nonetheless, France desperately needed American aid to rebuild itself in order not to fall in the Soviet orbit. In the first years of the Cold War, the fourth Republic seemed to have traded the American military umbrella for an independent foreign policy. Moreover, the birth of NATO in 1949 appeared first to unify the West against the Soviet threat. Nevertheless, tensions between France and the United States were already rising. Their main issue concerned the decolonization, but the number of problems involved would only increase with time. Those tensions would, indirectly, bring the downfall of the fourth Republic and, ironically, bring back De Gaulle to power. President De Gaulle would, in the first four years of his term, remain close to the United States, despite some divergences with the American administration. The end of the decolonization process ended a burden for France, freed the French ambitions. The policy of ""Grandeur"" was launched.

The research done in this thesis will begin to unpack why it is difficult to curate Islamic art, how it has been done both successfully and unsuccessfully in the past, and how it might be done in the future. The question revolves around the proposed idea that geopolitical context has a lasting and impactful influence on museum curation, and that museums must be considered within their geopolitical context in order to understand why objects have been curated in a particular way. The first chapter will explore the issues surrounding the curation of Islamic art, and how the secular and religious being so often conflated affects visitor perceptions of the objects, especially religious objects. The second chapter uses this analysis to explore the effect of imperial legacies on European museums and their curation of Islamic art and objects, highlighting how the context must be faced up to in order to ensure helpful curation. The third chapter looks to Turkey, and how the political, religious and cultural landscapes are intertwined, exploring how museums and curation are often used as part of political policy. Islamic art and objects, both religious and secular, are fascinating and form part of a culture which deserves to be curated in a way that dismantles tropes and stereotypes, whilst allowing the religious and secular elements of the culture to be effectively highlighted.",

The Influence of Bilingual Education on Dutch High School Students’ Realisations of English Word-final Obstruents and their Language Learning Motivation,"Sparreboom, Indah","['Grijzenhout, Janet']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Bilingual education programmes have been increasing in popularity in the Netherlands. These programmes use language integrated learning: a pedagogical principle through which the material is taught in a second language, often English. This thesis focusses on the effects of these programmes on pupils’ motivation to learn and to seek out native input, as well as on the influence these programmes have on students’ L2 phonology. More specifically, it analyses whether pupils are able to pronounce English word-final obstruents properly, both their voiced and voiceless variants. This is something that is particularly challenging, as prior research on the Marked Differential Hypothesis and Optimality Theory showed that voiced obstruents are a marked language feature of English, as well as one that is not present in Dutch. Through a digital questionnaire and a reading task, pupils from bilingual and monolingual streams of the same high school participated in this study. The research found no significant difference in the level of motivation or desire to seek out input between the two groups, but TTO students did use English captions more often when watching English films and series. Error analyses of the reading tasks of three pupils found that the TTO pupil did only devoice word-final fricatives, whereas the VWO pupils devoiced both the stops and the fricatives. Furthermore, other errors, such as applying the Dutch phonological rule of Regressive Voice Assimilation and altering the place of articulation, were only made by VWO pupils. Sending the recordings made by the pupils to native speakers confirmed that the TTO pupil did sound more native than the VWO pupils. However, due to the limited number of analyses, it can only be speculated what general effects bilingual education has on the L2 phonology of a wider variety of pupils.","['phonology', 'bilingual education', 'SLA']"

Cuban migration. The case of Cuban men that migrate through marriage,"Wiersma, Aimee","['Isla Monsalve, Pablo']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"“Will you marry me? (I need a European passport” is a quote written on a wall in London which shows a specific type regarding migration. Migration, a term that is greatly covered in academic research. There are many theories that attempt to define migration, as it appeared to be a complex study as no theory in itself explains the motivations behind migration. However, in contemporary literature on migration, labour migration is often prioritised over marriage migration, which is a subject that has received a lesser amount of attention when it comes to migration studies. This thesis deals with the phenomenon of marriage migration focussing on Cuban men with foreign women. Cuba’s history since the revolution of 1959 has shaped the island to its contemporary situation where tourism has been booming in the last three decades. This happened after the collapse of the Soviet Union and gave rise to migration through marriage, a phenomenon that has become well-known on the island throughout the years.","['Migration', 'Cuba', 'Marriage', 'Tourism', 'Policy']"

How US Foreign Policy Helped to Form Cuban State Legitimacy,"Ferris, Myles","['Solheim, Håvar', 'Silva, P.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"US foreign policy after the Cuban Revolution changed the way that the Cuban nation legitimated itself, which in turn influenced its national interests, and the way it interacted with other states on an international level. This thesis and its following research contextualizes itself in the Cold War era - in 1959 after the Cuban Revolution up until recent history - and examines the key concepts of legitimacy, national security, and foreign policy while investigating their specificities in regards to the Cuban state. It also attempts to understand how political struggle with the US has shaped these things, and has forced the Cuban state to adapt. The first chapter introduces the key concepts, and provides a theoretical framework which remains the backdrop throughout the other two chapters. The second chapter introduces the case of Cuba, and provides a historical contextualization of the period after the taking of power of Fidel Castro and the Revolutionary government up until the end of Castro’s leadership. The third chapter dives into the start of the period after Castro’s exit from Cuban politics, and examines how the period of Obama’s administration from 2008-2016 is unique in comparison to its preceding history. It also analyses how the use of state legitimacy in Cuba has changed. Finally this thesis attempts to answer the question: To what extent is Cuban state legitimacy impacted through aggressive foreign policy with the US?","['Cuba', 'US', 'Foreign Policy', 'National Security', 'State Legitimacy', 'Castro Era']"

The thesis has high philosophical and societal relevance, and engages fluently with a variety of important discourses: technical discussions of artificial intelligence, feminist scholarship, and commentaries on EU legal texts. After an introduction on machine learning and algorithms, the thesis moves to examinating those parts in the GDPR that address ADM, in order to clarify the way they are regulated. In the second and in the third chapter, problems such as the black box, different types of bias, technological design and neutrality are discussed. Gender bias are presented and many cases are discussed in order to provide reason of this growing phenomenon. A central topic of investigation is that of data representativeness, or how women data lack from our daily infrastructure at a point that discrimination normally occurs. This thesis ultimately seeks to provide a new framework for the introduction of a new feminist ethics of technology, that addresses bias and data collection in an intersectional way and especially that claims for new regulations to be discussed.","['technology', 'machine learning', 'ethics of technology', 'feminism', 'artificial intelligence']"

The ambiguity of marriage among formerly abducted Acholi women in Northern Uganda. A qualitative research eleven years after the ending of the armed conflict.,"Breuning, Marie-Claire","['Bruijn, M.E. de', 'Bemmel, K.L. van']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Research among Acholi women formerly associated with the rebel group the Lord’s Resistance Army in Northern Uganda has documented that the reintegration outcomes over time have been positive, but that challenges emerging from the post-conflict environment continue to exist, affecting their psychosocial wellbeing. This research was conducted in 2017, eleven years after the ending of the armed conflict in Northern Uganda. The focus of this thesis was to identify which factors had contributed to the processes of reintegration, seen from the personal perspective of formerly abducted Acholi women. Previous research supports the finding that marriage influences positive reintegration outcomes because marriage should offer the needed social and economic security in women’s reintegration process, based on the traditional institution of marriage. This hypothesis was confirmed in focus groups of both married and unmarried formerly abducted Acholi women. Subsequently, ten semi-structured interviews with formerly abducted Acholi women were used to assess to what extent marriage contributed to their material and psychosocial wellbeing, seen from the women’s personal perspectives. The results indicate that both variables are mediated by the quality of the marriage itself as a ‘primary support system’. Low quality of marriage could partly be compensated by the quality of the social network of the women and their own resiliency. One of the main (and remaining) problems of the women was the persistent ‘shaming’ in the community. Even though all of their husbands had been aware of their past at the time of marriage, the issue was permanently raised in internal marital conflicts and interaction with the family of husbands, especially in case of (family) conflicts. Furthermore, the internal marital conflicts seriously jeopardized the abilities of the women to support themselves economically and to guarantee the education of their children. In sum, this study demonstrates that being able to marry as a formerly abducted woman does not naturally guarantee successful reintegration. It is the quality of marriage based on the relationship between husband and wife, and the relationship between the wife and extended family members, that determine the marital levels of social and economic security which ultimately influences the women’s psychosocial wellbeing.","['post-war reintegration', 'post-war marriage', 'Northern Uganda', 'psychosocial wellbeing', 'anthropological-psychological analysis', 'marital quality', ""Lord's Resistance Army"", 'Acholi marriage institution', 'formerly abducted women']"

The Structural Challenges to Economic Diversification in Qatar,"Laurent, Lars","['Englert, Sai']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Economic diversification is understood as an important factor in stabilizing an economy based on the export of natural resources. As one of the richest countries per capita in the world, Qatar has gained most of its wealth from the export of natural gas. At the same time, the reliance on this export might lead to a vulnerable flow of income, with a changing energy market and volatile prices on oil and gas. Economic diversification has therefore become an important policy tool for Qatari leaders to ensure a sustainable future for the economy. However, even though diversification has been seemingly enhanced through economic policies, this thesis argues that there are several structural problems to the diversification process. Making use of the framework from the rentier state theory to explain these underlying structures, the thesis concludes that the structura problems to diversification in Qatar is the reliance on expatriate labour (1), a dominant public sector (2), redistributive politics (3) and the established social contract between state and citizens (4).","['Diversification', 'Rentier State Theory', 'Qatar', 'Gulf']"
The Invisible on Screens - Representations of Indian Rural Women in Bollywood,"Plüss, Sonja Muriel","['Choi, Nankyung']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Bollywood both shapes and is shaped by Indian society and its ideas on gender and nationhood. As such, it engages in the politics of representation as theorised by feminist film scholars. While extensive literature on the representation of women in Bollywood has arisen in the last two decades, less attention has been put on how rural populations or, more particularly, rural women are represented. This thesis attempts to fill this gap, recognising the invisibilization of rural women in India, especially the agrarian female workers who make up a major part of the national economy and around a fourth of the Indian population. I have used content and discourse analysis techniques on the Bollywood films Lagaan (2001) and Parched (2016) to investigate, firstly, the representation of Indian rural women in Bollywood, secondly the applicability of the theories developed through the literature on Indian women in Bollywood, and lastly, the possible implications of such representations on the visibility of Indian rural women, considering both the content and the reach of the films in the context of contemporary Bollywood. There is a multiplicity of representations of Indian women across Bollywood films, and this also applies for the representation of Indian rural women. In Lagaan, women play side-roles and are defined by their relation to the male characters; they are dedicated daughters, mothers and lovers. In Parched, the rural women are nuanced characters with desires, struggles and the will to fight for their agency in a patriarchal society. Even though the representations in Parched challenge notions of patriarchal and upper-class nationhood, its viewership and therefore the impact of the visibilization Indian rural women is limited to an elite and largely foreign audience, whereas the more patriarchal, but subaltern-perspective film Lagaan has reached Indian masses. Although women centric Bollywood films have been on the rise, a low number of films portray rural Indians and of those only few depict female characters in nuanced ways like done in Parched. This implies that Indian rural women remain largely invisibilized and stigmatized in Bollywood and in the imagination of the nation by the Bollywood audiences. Going forward, middle cinema offers a promising space for critical but still influential films, stimulating larger discussions on class and gender.","['India', 'Bollywood', 'Film Studies', 'Feminism', 'Agriculture', 'Feminist Film Studies']"

"Constant Worries and Varying Solutions: Pim Fortuyn and His Conceptions of Democracy, 1980-2002","Bormans, Abel","['Te Velde, Henk']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"During the election campaign of 2002, Pim Fortuyn (1948-2002) was accused on multiple occasions of being undemocratic. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate what democracy fundamentally meant to Fortuyn, by looking at his conception of democracy in the period 1980- 2002. Democracy was a key concept in his thinking and his concern for democracy was a red line throughout his intellectual development. How this democracy was to be achieved varied greatly, however, across Fortuyn’s political career. We can roughly distinguish three different periods in his views on democracy: social-democratic (1980-1988), neoliberal (1988-1995), and fundamentalist (1995-2002). The many changes in his views on democracy can be explained by contextual factors: he followed dominant political ideologies, was influenced by persons in his direct environment, and his views were often a rationalization of his own changing private experiences. That is not to say that Fortuyn was merely a passive product of that environment. He was an opinion maker, and talented at placing issues on the agenda. He also liked to create unrest, as he formulated conceptions of democracy that were on many aspects significantly different from mainstream Dutch political culture. It is difficult to see in Fortuyn someone seeking to bring about a crisis of liberal democracy; instead, the alternatives he envisaged was a representative democracy all the same, and he had far too much respect for ‘the democratic senses’ of the Dutch people, democratic values, and the rule of law. Though on two (brief) periods in his life he may have transgressed the boundaries of liberal democracy, the various periods of his political career may be regarded as having been characterized by a restless concern to achieve democracy rather than to overturn it.","['Pim Fortuyn', 'Democracy', 'Dutch Political History']"

The goal is to investigate the attitudes of Greek native speakers toward Roman-alphabeted Greek (also known as Greeklish) in Digitally-Mediated Communication (DMC), and more precisely in emails and SMS messages. In order to answer the research question, a modified Matched Guise Technique was applied to visual (text) rather than aural (sound) data. Emails and SMS messages in three different spellings, namely in using the Greek alphabet and two types of Romanized transliteration, phonetic and orthographic, were shown to a total number of 60 participants who were asked to evaluate the authors on a number of traits. Subsequently, using a questionnaire survey, participants’ attitudes were elicited more directly in order to reach more generalisable findings with regards to their perceptions of Greeklish. The findings showed that nowadays, not only has the use of Roman-alphabeted Greek in emails and SMS exchanges been diminished compared with 20 years ago, but Greek native speakers have adopted predominantly negative attitudes toward this linguistic phenomenon as well.","['Roman-alphabeted Greek', 'Greeklish', 'Digitally-Mediated Communication', 'attitudes', 'emails', 'SMS']"

Often thought of as a purely natural hazard, in reality it is amplified by social, political and economic factors. Urban flooding in particular is a problem heavily influenced by these factors. Nevertheless, the problem is still frequently treated as a natural one that can be solved by technological measures. I argue that this approach is not efficient and forms the reason why urban flooding has not been solved yet. Instead, a deeper understanding of society is necessary in order to find sustainable solutions that benefit everyone. In the current situation, the urban poor are more at risk than the wealthy and mitigation efforts should consider these inequalities. Only by actively fighting inequality as underlying cause of urban flooding is it possible to ease the impacts of urban flooding and to create a resilient society.

The election of Trump has been considered as a rupture with the Obama’s presidency until the point of being accused of having as main goal of erasing all the political work performed by Obama in his eight-year mandate. Specifically, from the moment in which Trump took power, an international concern grew with regard to the future of the liberal international order, which might be put in serious danger as a result of the application of the America First rhetoric. By placing US interests at the center of his foreign policy, Trump has engaged in the LIO with a very different behaviour than Obama. In this thesis I will explore these different behaviors by analyzing how the two presidents have participated in international agreements, by conducting a comparative analysis of two specific treaties: The Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Agreement. This comparison will also shed a light on the impacts that these two opposed approaches may have on the order.","['Liberal International Order', 'USA', 'International Agreements', 'Foreign Policy']"
New Position for Language of Thieves in Uganda,"Nieuwenhuizen, Sven","['Mourigh, Khalid']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines the perception Ugandan citizens have of Swahili. Historically, Swahili and Uganda have not been a good marriage. There is an abundant amount of literature available about the use of Swahili in Uganda by security forces. Furthermore, Swahili was used by Idi Amin’s army, which oppressed the citizens of Uganda. This factor has contributed to several studies arguing, that Ugandan people did and do not like Swahili. The Luganda speakers especially, resisted to Swahili being implemented in different layers of Uganda’s society. However, new aims for implementing Swahili in Uganda are being made by the East African Community, which declared Swahili the lingua franca of the community. 55 interviews with Ugandan citizens have been conducted, in order to examine whether the negative attitudes towards Swahili are still present. This will show how the policies regarding Swahili of the intergovernmental organisation, namely the East African Community, are perceived by Ugandans. The results of the interviews conducted show a different perception of Swahili in Uganda than has been argued by past studies. Most people see opportunities for learning Swahili and it will be a next step towards East-African integration.","['Uganda', 'East African Community', 'Swahili', 'Language Policies', 'Language Attitude']"

When a memory is perceived by a community, the community can strategically choose either to remember or to forget a certain part of memory, depending on their aim. This memory can be called ‘collective memory’, since it involves memory that is shared by the community, such as nations. It is not just memories of a single individual’s experience or a collection of past events, rather it is memory that is reformulated. It is often symbolized by monuments and statues. Furthermore, it consists of various communications and negotiations from one generation to the later generations. History textbooks, for example, in advanced learning institutions or the rhetoric of political leaders can be involved in forming collective memory. The thesis will focus on the practical function of collective memories, which form individual or national identity, especially in post-war periods. As case studies, West Germany and Japan will be used and their post-war collective memory will be analysed, for the period between 1950-1980. It will examine how war memory was utilized in collective memory in both countries.","['Collective Memory', 'West Germany', 'Japan', 'Post-war', 'World War II']"

Soyka explains that “the underlying theme [of Frankenstein] is rooted in Miltonic questions about the first creation. If God is the creator of all things, why did He create evil to ruin his creation?” (167). Unsurprisingly, in many modern adaptations of the novel, the monster is presented as a grotesque figure of violence, highlighting its “evil” tendencies. Yet this thesis will foreground how the second of James Whale’s Frankenstein adaptations, Bride of Frankenstein (1935), transforms the original intertextual relations between Shelley’s monster and the figure of Satan in Paradise Lost by alluding directly to the figure of Adam and more implicitly to his companion Eve. The creation of a female monster in this classic film adaptation of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein highlights the intertextuality of Whale’s monsters with Adam and Eve in Milton’s Paradise Lost, as the female monster presents a link to this Edenic narrative.","['Frankenstein', 'Adaptation Studies', 'Paradise Lost', 'Film Studies']"

Changes in Japanese Organizational Culture: Assessing the Role of Women in Organizations since the 1990s,"Van Lit, Asa","['Shibata, Saori']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research paper examines the role and influence of women in Japanese organizational cultures since their involvement in the labor force starting in the 1990s. This new labor force consisted of educated and highly-skilled women and was partly made possible due to the social visibility Japanese women started to receive during this time. As a result, Japanese organizational culture as we know it has gradually changed as well. Previous findings have suggested that women somewhat differ in some features of organizational culture, such as speech, dress code, and behavior. Due to these slight differences in these features, Japanese organizations began to change some of their policies and thus their organizational culture in order to develop a more inclusive environment. By analyzing several traditional Japanese organizations and their cultures, this paper demonstrates that Japanese women have influenced their organizational cultures to a certain extent.

Responsible Agriculture: An Analysis of Discourse and Decision Making on Risk Assessment and Management of Genetically Modified Staple Crop Import and Cultivation in the European Union,"Warren, Florence","['Ieven, Bram']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The European Union (EU) imports Genetically Modified (GM) Staple Crops (SC) for animal feed and to be used in food chain production. GM SC are imported mostly from the United States, Canada, Brazil and Argentina. However, this is generally not public knowledge. This is partly due to EU policy on the cultivation of GM being highly regulated. Hence the belief of some that the EU is a GM-free zone. On a global perspective, the EU is one of the most conservative users of GM. One could talk of a European culture of anti-GM. For some, this culture has been intervening with science and has been prospering misinformation and mystification of GM. This has been argued to put Food Security, Safety and Sustainability at risk. Hence, the current model of Agricultural Policy in the EU is not Responsible. It is therefore important to deconstruct the culture that has formed around GM in the EU to be able to understand the discourse narrative and to analyse the decision to not cultivate but import GM SC.","['European Union', 'Genetic Modification', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Framing', 'Risk Society', 'Staple Crops', 'European Agriculture', 'Argentina', 'Responsible Innovation']"

Discrimination of non-native vowel contrasts: An ERP study on the effect of unsupervised distributional training in cases of boundary shift vs. category creation in an L2,"Aitken, Robbie","['Schiller, Niels', 'Pablos Robles, Leticia']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The paper seeks to replicate the effects of the three-point distributional training paradigm found by Chládková et al. (2020, under review), while using an acoustic dimension which allows for the direct comparison of two second-language perceptual learning scenarios: category creation and boundary shift (i.e. NEW and SIMILAR sounds under the L2LP framework (Escudero, 2009)). To this end, an EEG-experiment was run using a pre-test – training – post-test design. The pre- and post-tests involved a passive-oddball paradigm, whereby participants (Dutch native speakers without formal English phonetic training) heard a sequence of repetitive synthetic vowel sounds, where the standard was /ɛ/ (which exists in both Dutch and English), and the deviants were /ɪ/ (which also exists in both Dutch and English) and /æ/ (which only exists English). Between the pre- and post-tests, participants underwent distributional training of either the /æ/-/ɛ/ or the /ɪ/-/ɛ/ contrast, following a three-point paradigm, as set out by Chládková et al. (2020, under review). The /æ/-/ɛ/ group therefore constitutes a case of category creation, whereas the /ɪ/-/ɛ/ group constitutes only a case of boundary shift. The electrophysiological data was intended to measure the mismatch negativity (MMN) response – an ERP component which indicates perceived deviation from a repetitive sequence of sounds (Näätänen & Kreegipuu, 2012). It is expected that in the pre-test, the participants will distinguish the /ɪ/-/ɛ/ contrast, but not the /æ/-/ɛ/ contrast, since the latter does not exist in their L1 (Dutch). In the post-test, it is expected that the /ɪ/-/ɛ/ boundary will have shifted as a result of training, although it is to be discovered whether the /æ/ category will be created. It was found that the /ɪ/-/ɛ/ trained group were able to shift their /ɪ/-/ɛ/ boundary as a result of the training. For the category creation scenario, however, no significant effects of training were found. Given the very small sample size in this experiment, however (n per training group = 5), these results must be viewed with caution.","['category learning', 'distributional learning', 'mismatch negativity', 'non-native sound discrimination']"
Reimagining Europe: Envisioning a Durable Model of European Identity,"Gerrits, Sam","['Li, Jingjing']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The idea of a common European identity is formed and influenced by many different factors. Orientalism and internal religious and cultural differences have historically been the main pillars on which the concept of Europe was founded. However, these foundations seem outdated within the modern framework, arguably to be seen in recent crises such as the Eurozone crisis, rising nationalist tendencies and a decreasing sense of European solidarity. Therefore, this essay explores the possibility of a reimagination of the European identity in such a way that it can cope better with the challenges modern Europe faces. To this end, the first part of the essay will investigate the historical foundation on which current European identity is based, and the limits this identification has. After which, the essay explores both Charles Taylors concept of the politics of recognition – a communitarian multicultural identity politics – and Francis Fukuyama’s model of a liberal democratic identity politics. While a ‘perfect fit’ model to reimagine European identity lays far beyond the scope of this enquiry, the third chapter shall conclude with lessons that can be learned from the Fukuyaman and Tayloresque models to reimagine the European identity.","['European Identity', 'Politics of Recognition', 'Francis Fukuyama', 'Charles Taylor', 'European Union']"

Through American Eyes: The New York Times and CBS News’s Depictions of the Orange Revolution,"Pappouti, Georgia","['Schellens, Dorine']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores how the American media outlets, Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) News and The New York Times, have reported on Ukraine’s Orange Revolution. It specifically seeks to answer the research question: How have the CBS News and the New York Times media outlets represented the Orange Revolution to American readers between 2004 and 2006? The thesis argues that while these two American news outlets have introduced issues within Ukraine’s political system to their audience, both have mainly emphasized the Western position and perspective on the Orange Revolution. The US’ media perspectives of the Orange Revolution have been under-researched, which has decreased scholars’ understanding of Colour Revolutions as a whole. This is important to take into account because such post-Soviet demonstrations continue to take place, such as Kyrgyzstan’s Tulip Revolution. Hence, analysing and understanding the previous ones can help better predict when and where they can occur again in the future. Moreover, the US has attempted to represent itself as a peaceful, democratic country, which implies that countries which have Colour Revolutions would likely receive financial or political assistance from the former. The media can also construct narratives which could prompt other Western nations to assist in situations of political upheaval.","['Ukraine', 'Democratisation', 'USA', 'Media']"

Changing Relations in the South China Sea: Indonesia and Singapore and their Responses to Rising Power China,"de Jong, Kelly","['Henley, David']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"China is a rising power, something that has become increasingly evident in the South China Sea dispute in the past decade. In 2009, China for the first time officially and unilaterally declared sovereignty over a large part of the South China Sea (SCS). At that time, both the biggest and smallest states of the region, Indonesia and Singapore, did not belong to the so-called ‘claimant states’. However, the increased tension in the SCS as a consequence of China’s maritime expansion leads to both states being affected by this dispute. Therefore, this thesis aims to examine the question ‘’How and why have Indonesia and Singapore responded to the increased Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea, despite both initially not being claimant states?’’ Outlining the developments in the South China Sea and looking at the dimensions of economic relations and domestic political factors, this thesis will try to explain the responses of Indonesia and Singapore to an increasingly assertive China in the South China Sea in the past decade. What could be concluded is that while Singapore and, to a greater extent, Indonesia are economically increasingly dependent on China, which could lead to turning a blind eye to China’s behaviour in the SCS, the two Southeast Asian states have instead increasingly criticized China in the past decade in order to go against its growing assertive behaviour. This response comes out of dynamics in domestic politics that does not allow the two states to behave submissively.","['International Relations', 'South China Sea', 'China', 'Singapore', 'Indonesia', 'Economic Relations']"

From My Land and My People to Freedom in Exile: Imagery by the Dalai Lama in his Autobiographies,"Maar, Rutger van der","['Verhagen, P.C.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The two autobiographies of the Dalai Lama contain a wide range of descriptions, visualizations and judgments about Tibet and Tibetans, the PRC and Chinese and others. Members of different groups come to judgments and valorize the other depending on their own point of view. According to researchers, Tibetan exile leaders have deliberately adopted and adapted images, including pre-1959 images that existed in the West, to entice public support for the Tibetan cause, yet there is little research into the use of images by the Dalai Lama. Using discourse analysis I will examine how the Dalai Lama uses images in My Land and My People and Freedom in Exile and argue that images such as myths, clichés and Western stereotypes are used to emphasize the uniqueness, victimhood and respectfulness of Tibet and Tibetans, whereas he uses negative images to describe the PRC and the Chinese. Analysis of the results confirms earlier research that people make use of preconceived images when describing others, while the Dalai Lama’s words are indeed beneficial to Tibetans and could in that way have convinced people for supporting the Tibetan cause. Broader research into his actions, as well as into his other work could provide more clarity in this, while research into his work and public performance meant for a Tibetan audience could give an idea whether he uses different imagery when describing the other and the self than in work catering to an international audience.","['Dalai Lama', 'Autobiography', 'My Land and My People', 'Freedom in Exile', 'Images', 'myth', 'cliché', 'Tibet', 'China', 'Shangri-La']"

"The """"Other"""" in Modern Secondary History Textbook Narratives from Mexico and the United States: Connection, Conflict, or Indifference?","Davidson, Ryan","['Paul, Herman']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"In most countries' history classrooms, a textbook still plays a key role, and the narratives of these texts help to shape students' perceptions of their nation and others. A large body of American research exists examining the historical narratives of ethnic minorities in the United States, including Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, but few studies have examined this question using a textbook sample from across the border aimed at mainstream secondary students. This research raised the question of inclusion of the """"other"""" (Mexico in American texts and US in Mexican texts) for the period of the twentieth century. It did this through quantitative analysis of index entries, highlights, pictorial inclusion and text spacing, and also through a qualitative approach of positive/negative coding and using existing theoretical frameworks for narrative analysis. The findings indicated that Mexican texts include references to the US on over 30% of text pages, while US texts average 5% references to the southern neighbor. Additionally, by a 2:1 margin in both cases the coding reveals more negative references than positive, though this can also include victimhood of racial discrimination or economic imperialism. Still, the texts are generally more inclusive than those used in past studies and decades, and sparse but relevant emphasis on cross border cooperation may provide insight into future direction for transnational history provided to a broad audience of secondary students.","['Textbooks', 'History', 'School', 'United States', 'Mexico']"

Nakamura Kusatao: The Modernization of Haiku,"Liu, Anzhi","['Smits, Ivo']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"To encounter a flower, a snowflake, or a moon in haiku it is not uncommon. A great amount of haiku follow a rule, or an aesthetic preference, that the elements of nature should be present in its form with a 5-7-5 syllables arrangement. All of these preferences were challenged in the Secondary Art Debate (daini geijutsu ronsō 第二芸術論争) after WWII. What poetry should do was beyond this form of art. This discourse was brought into heated discussion and opposed by numerous contemporary haiku poets. Nakamura Kusatao 中村草田男(1901-1983), one of the founding haiku poets of the so-called “the Humanity-pursuit group” (ningen tankyūha 人間探求派), pioneered in this debate. He publicly refuted the condemnation of haiku as a “secondary art” and dedicated his life to strengthen his position in this debate, and dedicated his entire career to the modernization of haiku. The central research question of this thesis is how Nakamura envisage the modernization of twentieth-century haiku. In the further discussion, Nakamura’s attitude towards modern haiku is to be discussed. The context that apparently stimulated Nakamura to explore innovation in haiku will be provided in the first chapter, where two major debates in his life are the center of discussion. To understand the general directions that his innovations took, his haiku theory will be introduced in the following chapter. In the third chapter, the analysis will go through his major work from the form to the content to examine the differences between Nakamura’s work and the traditional work before him.","['haiku', 'Nakamura Kusatao', 'modernization']"
Een analyse van de roman Aşk-ı memnu van Halid Ziya Uşaklıgil,"Linzel, Maïta Elisabeth Anna","['De Bruijn, Petra']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek richt zich op invloed van de taal- en alfabethervormingen van de laat Osmaanse periode tot in de Turkse Republiek op het taalgebruik in de Turkse literatuur. Daarvoor zijn verschillende uitgaven van de roman Aşk-ı memnu (Verboden liefde) van Halid Ziya Uşaklıgil geanalyseerd. De keus is op deze roman gevallen, omdat deze oorspronkelijk vóór de hervormingen is uitgegeven en later in een gesimplificeerde (sadeleştirilmiş) vorm opnieuw is uitgegeven. De verschillen in het taalgebruik kunnen worden verklaard door de historische context, in lijn met de wetenschappelijke stroming van het New Historicism en Cultural Materialism. De aanpassingen die in nieuwere versies zijn doorgevoerd laten de ideologische en politieke normen zien van de tijd waarin ze gepubliceerd zijn. Deze uitgaven na de hervormingen worden gepresenteerd als origineel, maar zijn dat niet omdat het taalgebruik is veranderd. Hierdoor raakt het originele werk in onbruik. Dit onderzoek laat zien dat de hervormingen inderdaad invloed hebben gehad op het taalgebruik. Die invloed toont zich in aanpassingen die in lijn zijn met het beleid van taal- en alfabethervormingen, zoals het vervangen van Perzische en Arabische grammatica door Turkse grammatica. Ook in lijn met het beleid is dat woorden met een Arabische of Perzische oorsprong vervangen worden door woorden met een Turkse oorsprong. Echter, dit onderzoek laat ook zien dat de aanpassingen niet altijd het doel bereiken wat ermee beoogd werd. Zo worden er bijvoorbeeld wel aanpassingen gedaan, maar blijft het woord van niet-Turkse oorsprong. Kortom, dit onderzoek laat zien dat de hervormingen verregaande gevolgen hebben gehad op het taalgebruik in de Turkse literatuur. Zowel overeenkomstig het beoogde beleid, als niet-beoogde neveneffecten. De aanpassingen laten de politieke en ideologische normen zien van verschillende perioden waarin de latere edities zijn uitgekomen.","['Taalhervormingen', 'alfabethervormingen', 'Turkije Turkse Republiek']"

Hawker centres are essentially communal dining spaces that allow Singaporeans from different ethnic backgrounds to enjoy a wide range of hawker foods for an affordable price. Singapore’s hawker culture has been able to exist alongside Singapore’s rapid urban development, beginning with street food sold by itinerant hawkers and transformed into hawker centres. Over the years these hawker centres have become more than just dining spaces and have become an indispensable part of Singapore. Changes in Singapore’s near future have triggered questions about the continuity of the hawker trade and the preservation of traditional dishes. Taking matters in their own hands, Singapore has nominated hawker culture for UNESCO’s Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity as they believe this is an intrinsic part of Singaporean identity and should be preserved and passed down to future generations. The aim of this thesis is to study the meaning of hawker culture in contemporary Singapore by discussing three periods of time, while discussing food as intangible heritage and its contribution to identity and belongingness.","['Singapore', 'heritage', 'food', 'belonging', 'UNESCO', 'hawker']"

This is done by analysing the travel-writings of Marcus van Blankenstein, who later published his experiences in the Nieuw Rotterdamsche Courant. His findings are contrasted with the reports of other journalists in other popular Dutch newspapers at the time. At that time the Dutch society was in a state of 'verzuiling' meaning the people that believed in certain ideologies seperated themselves from people that clung to other ideologies. This created a situation in which four columns coexisted, forming the Dutch society. Each column had it's own radiostation, newspaper and political party. By analysing the way Sovjet Russia was portrayed in the newspapers, this thesis tries to show how the different columns felt about the developments in Russia at that time. There was a great deal of uncertainty about the developments in Russia after the revolution, this thesis also shows the way in which this nescience affected the way Sovjet Russia was portrayed.","['Imaging', 'Newspapers', 'Blankenstein', 'Interbellum', 'Sovjet Russia', 'Dutch press']"
