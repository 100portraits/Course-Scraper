Caulobacter crescentus holdfast: A bio-based and water-resistant adhesive,"['Castelein, Sofie']","['Niemann, Helge H.']",2023-03-15T01:01:19Z,EN,['Biobased; adhesive; Water-resistant; glue;  C. crescentus; holdfast; biosynthesis; bio-inspired'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"Due to climate change, society demands more environmentally friendly products. An excellent way to approach this is to develop more circular, waste-free, zero/negative emission or biodegradable products. For something to be biodegradable it has to be completely biobased. A few examples of biobased materials are hemp isolation panels and furniture created out of mycelium bio-composites. 
Something that does not have a biobased alternative yet is a good performing underwater glue. There is a lot to gain here because even synthetic glues lack strength under wet or underwater conditions. This hypothetical biobased glue could be incredibly useful in the industrial field but also in the medical field to quickly repair bleeding wounds. In order to create a new biobased and environmentally friendly product of high quality, it is often a great start to look at the solutions provided by nature. 
Organisms first developed in the sea and animals like sand-castle worms, mussels and barnacles have already found ways to make excellent underwater glue. They mainly use a glue that is made of proteins to adhere to any underwater surface. Scientists have tried to mimic these glues but due to their complexity they have not yet succeeded in making an equally strong and marketable biobased underwater glue. 
Another type of organisms that produce underwater glue are bacteria, especially the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, which creates a holdfast that is currently the record holder of the strongest natural underwater glue ever measured. According to a few experiments it could hold a weight of 680 kg per cm2, the equivalent of holding a large horse with a glue surface area the size of a small coin.  
However, because the bacterium C. crescentus produces so little of the holdfast, it has been difficult to study and we currently do not know where its adhesive strength comes from. A few advancements have been made recently that might enable to investigate this holdfast further. Once the exact structure and chemical components of holdfast have been discovered we might be able to understand why it is so strong. This might help us with developing a new type of glue inspired by this holdfast. 
Other than its exact chemical composition we also want to know how the holdfast is produced by studying its biosynthetic pathway. This will not only give us more insights in how holdfast is created but might also allow us to mimic it ourselves. 
To produce the glue ourselves, it might be possible to genetically modify C. crescentus so that it produces a lot more of the holdfast. Alternatively, we could try to insert the biosynthetic pathway of holdfast in another more well-known and easy to culture bacterium like Escherichia coli. Then this bacterium will  produce the holdfast for us in large quantities, something that is already done with certain medicine like hormones and vaccines.  When we produce enough holdfast, we can do more mechanical testing and experiments on the properties of holdfast to find out if it would be suitable as a new underwater/wet adhesive."
Exploring the ribosomal stress pathway as a targetable vulnerability in TP53 aberrant Acute Lymphoblastic leukemia,"['Reijers, Sacha']","['Leeuwen, Frank van']",2023-03-16T01:01:11Z,EN,['Ribosomal Stess Pathway; Ribosome Biogenesis; TP53; leukemia; eEF2K.'],"Cancer, Stem Cells and Developmental Biology","Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in children. Although
the survival rates have been increasing, relapses are still occurring, which are generally hard to cure.
Especially relapses showing aberrations in TP53 predict a dismal outcome due to their high resistance
against most chemotherapeutic drugs, but also novel immune therapies that have entered the clinic.
Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need for better therapies for TP53 deleted ALL. In the last decade the
ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) pathway has emerged as an effective target in cancer therapy. RiBi is known to
play a role in oncogenic signalling pathways and is therefore highly regulated to maintain cellular
homeostasis. Monitoring of RiBi is managed by ribosomal stress signaling pathways that can sense both
through p53 or be p53-independent. The role of the ribosomal stress pathway in the development of ALL is
underlined by the presence of somatic mutations in several ribosomal proteins that all have been linked to
contribute to T-ALL progression. In a study to find new vulnerabilities of TP53 aberrant ALL, they identified
eEF2K as a new vulnerable target. eEF2K is a protein which negatively regulates translation elongation and
can be activated upon many different stresses, including ribosomal stress. eEF2K is also under investigation
as a possible novel molecular target for cancer treatment. In this review I have explored the ribosomal
stress pathway as a potential targetable vulnerability in p53 aberrant ALL in order to provide a mechanistic
explanation for the observed synthetic lethality between loss of TP53 function and loss of eEF2K in ALL
under conditions of cellular stress. For this I reviewed different p53-(in)dependent ribosomal stress
signalling pathways, looked at how aberrations in RiBi and these pathways can be linked to cancer
development, and how these pathways can be used as a target for the development of new and improved
anticancer therapies. Finally, I examined the role of eEF2K, its connection to ribosomal stress and its
contribution to cancer progression."
Utilizing Conditions for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Brain MRI,"['Novikov, Yan']","['Vincken, Koen']",2023-03-15T01:01:25Z,EN,['Anomaly detection; generative adversarial networks; brain MRI'],Medical Imaging,"A need to label vast amounts of data in medical image analysis makes supervised algorithms time-consuming and raises concerns about incorrectly annotated pathologies.
Unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, which employ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), exist to tackle this issue.
Such methods are supposed to detect unseen abnormal data by learning the distribution of the normal one.
However, the norm is considered unified for a given task and does not account for any variability between samples, which may make its bounds vaguer.
We assume that reckoning for external information about an image under examination can resolve this issue.
This paper studies whether conditional GANs are suitable for patch-wise anomaly detection on brain MR images.
We propose incorporating such attributes as age and patch position to better account for inter-patient variability. 
We train two GANs using \(64 \times 64\) images of chairs rotated by different angles from the RC-49 dataset and \(32 \times 32 \times 32\) patches from T1 weighted brain scans from the IXI dataset. 
We then reconstruct normal and abnormal samples with a modified image projection technique and use the obtained style vectors and the external attributes to assign anomaly scores to the images.
On the test chair images, our approach achieves accuracy values of 88.4%, and we found it applicable to the 2D case.
Nevertheless, on the brain patches, it shows a lower accuracy value of 64.3% for the test samples, indicating its inefficiency when applied to the 3D MR data in the proposed form.
We also discuss the potential causes of the failed experiment and possible future avenues for improvement of the proposed approach."
Combining BCI with functional electrical stimulation for facial nerve paralysis in locked-in indviduals,"['Canny, Evan Canny']","['Berezutskaya, Julia']",2023-03-15T01:01:30Z,EN,"['Locked-in syndrome, BCI, FES, facial movements, facial expressions, intracortical activity.']",Neuroscience and Cognition,"Locked-in syndrome (LIS) is a nervous system disorder that is characterised by loss of voluntary muscle control, which can lead to whole body paralysis. Classical and incomplete LIS patients retain the ability to produce eye movements, which enable communication through gaze-controlled/eye-tracking systems that allow patients to choose letters from a keyboard to type messages on a screen. However, these communication methods limit rapid, natural communication and are unable to allow the expression of emotion. Furthermore, total LIS patients do not retain the ability to produce eye movements, and as such, gaze-controlled communication systems are inaccessible to these patients. To overcome the limitations of such communication systems, this paper posits that the combination of intracortical brain computer interfaces (iBCI) and functional electrical stimulation (FES) technology could be utilised to restore functional facial movements and facial expressions in locked-in individuals. Previous research has demonstrated the restoration of functional arm and hand movements in tetraplegic patients using iBCI-FES systems. Furthermore, facial FES research has shown that FES-induced functional facial movements and facial expressions are feasible in healthy subjects and facial nerve paralysis patients (FNP). This line of research has successfully demonstrated FES-induced eyeblinks, eyebrow raises, frowning, smiling, and limited speech articulation. However, no research to date has attempted to induce functional facial movements or facial expressions using FES on LIS patients. This paper argues that facial FES research findings in FNP patients can be used to inspire novel iBCI-FES systems for LIS patients to restore facial movements and facial expressions. Such systems could be used to improve communication and expression of emotions in these patients, which would likely have positive effects for their wellbeing and QoL."
Revolutionizing the Understanding of Immune Cell Heterogeneity through Single-Cell Transcriptomics,"['Selten, Aimée']","['Boer, Rob de']",2023-03-15T01:01:22Z,EN,['Single-cell RNA sequencing; transcriptomes; immune cells; immunology; cellular heterogeneity; developmental trajectories'],Infection and Immunity,"Studying the immune system broadens our understanding of the underlying mechanisms contributing to health and disease. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has provided an alternative unbiased approach to study gene expression on a single cell-level and has emerged as one of the leading techniques to uncover the immune system’s complex networks. It has allowed researchers to discover rare cell types and novel cell states in the immune system and has provided a comprehensive overview of the novel insights in immune cell characteristics, temporal, and spatial distribution as well as cellular function. Here, a review summarizing the current state of research of single-cell transcriptomics is provided, focusing on hematopoietic origin, novel immune cell types in thymus organogenesis, as well as the developing and the adult immune system. Moreover, we highlight the limitations inherent to the scRNA-seq experimental pipeline that propose challenges in advancing our knowledge of the comprehensive immune cell landscape."
Microscopic gossip: quorum sensing in the adaptive immune system,"['Zonneveld, Tessa']","['Boer, Rob de']",2023-03-15T01:01:28Z,EN,['Quorum sensing; immune system; T cells; mathematical modelling'],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"When an infection occurs in the human body, the body responds by sending many different types of immune cells to the infection. Some of these cells can stop the infection, others can create memory cells that can attack quickly if the infection happens again. A family of cells that is very important in this process is T cells. There are many different types of T cells. For example, T effector cells come in different kinds depending on the type of infection they respond to and they coordinate other parts of the immune system. T regulatory cells make sure that the body’s response does not become so big that it hurts the healthy tissue. T memory cells take care of the response to a secondary infection. For an efficient response all of these types of cells should be present at appropriate proportions. This can be regulated through limiting the amount of nutrients that is available for each cell type, or through naturally occurring death of old cells. Another mechanism that has been studied is quorum sensing. Quorum sensing was first described in bacteria and refers to a shared response of a whole population of bacteria to the density of the population. That is, at low bacterial densities, the bacteria show individual behaviour. However, when the density becomes high enough, they can change their behaviour into a group-level behaviour such as producing light. The bacteria can sense their density by secreting and taking up a substances called autoinducers. While this phenomenon is known mostly from microbial organisms, several studies suggest that this process could also contribute to the functioning of the human immune system.
   This paper evaluates four mathematical models found in literature to see how quorum sensing contributes to immune responses and how accurately T cells can respond to their local density. Two of the models explain how, using the autoinducer IL-2, T cells can decide when they should start or stop an immune response. For example, if too little T cells respond to a substance in the body, the body decides that substances must belong to the body itself and therefore does not count as an infection. This means no immune response will be started. When enough T cells respond, however, an immune response will be started. The other two models elaborate on the influence of quorum sensing on the differentiation of T cells. They try to explain how the T cell density can determine which type of T cell other cells change into. These models suggest that the T cell density can influence cells to become a specific type of T effector cell or even a T memory cell. All of the behaviours that are modelled imply that responses resembling quorum sensing can occur in the immune system and that it is worthwhile to further study these processes."
From il and elle to iel and ael: the French Gender Revolution - A Semantic Model of Pronominal Grammar Changes in French,"['Rendl, Liv']","['Swart, Henriëtte de']",2023-03-16T01:01:06Z,EN,['Neo-pronouns; French; Pronominal grammar; DRT; Semantics; Pronoun Resolution'],Linguistics,"In recent years, the emancipation of women and the increasing awareness of identities outside the gender binary of man and woman have been a central debate in western society. Since the 2000’s the French language has seen linguistic changes reflecting these societal changes. The most recent developments are the so-called Écriture Inclusive and the Écriture Neutre. Analysing these language changes, the present thesis focuses on two common neo-pronouns iel(s) and ael(s) emerging from these societally induced languages changes and investigates their effects on pronominal grammar in French. This research bases itself on a corpus study of the use of these neo-pronouns, creating he foundation for a re-worked model of pronoun resolution with in Discourse Representation Theory. Combining the works of Kamp & Reyle (1993), Van der Sandt (1992) and Hunter (2013) this thesis takes a presuppositional approach to pronoun resolution allowing for the inclusion of extra-linguistic information for their interpretation."

Interactive Video Game Live-Streaming,"['Rannem, Trym']","['Frommel, J.']",2023-03-17T01:01:04Z,EN,[],Game and Media Technology,"Lately, user-generated video game live-streams have exploded in popularity and become a common source of entertainment. As a result, video game live-streaming has attracted increased attention as a research area. In recent years, there have been several studies focused on how to drive engagement and enhance the audience experience in gaming live-streams by applying different types of interaction mechanisms. However, there is of yet little research that investigates the usage of interaction mechanisms for directly influencing the game that is being streamed. Meanwhile, tools to implement such mechanisms are available, and some applications of this have already been demonstrated. There are strong indications that both viewers and streamers desire such interaction mechanisms. However, due to the nature of how today’s streaming services operate and their limitations, designing these types of mechanisms comes with a number of challenges tied to stream delay, arbitrary number of viewers, and user interface design. As of today, there are not yet any established best practices on how to overcome these challenges while retaining an engaging audience experience. Therefore, the main goal of this research is to investigate how to achieve an engaging audience experience in scenarios where viewers of gaming live-streams can influence the game that is being played directly through an interface on the stream, with a large focus on the aforementioned challenges. To achieve this, I used an iterative approach, first performing a preliminary design exploration study, where I designed and implemented three different interaction mechanisms, and then a second evaluation study, where experts evaluated the mechanisms. The mechanism types were majority vote with discrete options, heatmaps, and interface around interactive items. All of these interaction mechanisms showed promising results, with varying potential for enhancing the viewer experience depending on their execution. Interface around interactive items seemed to be the mechanism that yielded the best results overall, with the highest chance of having a positive impact on the audience experience. The research suggests that interactions where viewers do not expect instant reactions can be highly effective for compensating for delays, and clear communication of the game state can be helpful. Exploiting the crowd mentality by creating situations where viewers are incentivized to work together towards a common goal can also be effective, both for accommodating for different audience sizes and for masking the delay. The user interface should be clear, understandable, and intuitive, with relevant feedback and instructions provided. Overall, interactive overlays seem to have the potential to significantly increase the viewer experience in gaming live-streams, especially if the interface is well-designed and does not detract from the gameplay."
Parameterized Complexity Of Defensive Alliances,"['Horn, Beowulf']","['Leeuwen, Erik Jan van']",2023-03-17T01:00:55Z,EN,[],Computing Science,"A Defensive Alliance in a graph is a subset of the vertices where each vertex in the alliance has more neighbours in the alliance, than outside it. They were originally introduced to model military alliances, but the concept has application in areas such as modelling communities and also fault tolerant computing.

Finding small Defensive Alliances is known to be a NP-Complete problem, even in restrictive graph classes such as planar graphs. The difficulty of finding small Defensive Alliances provides the motivation to look at the parameterised complexity of the problem, which in the literature is documented only for a small number of parameters such as Solution Size, Vertex Cover and Neighbourhood Diversity. Further, a restricted set of variants were considered in the literature, with limited practical work done in finding alliances.

This thesis endeavored to address these limitations by studying the parameterised complexity of variants of Defensive Alliance, considers new parameters for Defensive Alliance and conducts computational experiments using implementations of some of the algorithms discussed in the thesis. For the variants, the general results involve several novel variants, such as one that generalises the number of neighbours required for each vertex, several that force larger components of the alliance to depend on sets of constraints, vertex and edge weighted variants. For these, whether or not it was possible to extend the existing algorithms to the variants is discussed.

Results are given for several new parameters, including Modular Width and Distance to Clique, for Defensive Alliance, along with minor results covering the use of multiple parameters. Further, a previously studied problem called Globally Minimal Defensive Alliance is shown to be in para-NP when parameterised by Solution Size.

Finally, experimental results for a variety of exact algorithms and heuristics are discussed."
The Importance of Replication In Uncertain Epistemic Landscapes,"['Kiel, Lamar']","['Klein, Dominik']",2023-03-17T01:00:57Z,EN,['Agent-Based Model ; Epistemic Landscape ; Uncertainty ; Replication Crisis ; Replication'],Artificial Intelligence,"Scientific research is mainly done in groups of scientists working in different parts of a specific research domain. This division of work is called the division of cognitive labour. The division of labour is originally interested in scientists that do different tasks in science. This thesis focuses on different attitudes of scientists and how they cooperate. We present an agent-based model of scientific research in which scientists are divided to explore and exploit unknown areas on an uncertain scientific landscape. The model is a complexification of the models from Muldoon \& Weisberg, and Thoma. Scientists aim to find and correctly identify the best approaches for a research problem. However, outcomes of scientific research can be erroneous. Therefore, replication is needed to verify what approaches are best. Failing to replicate is not a direct indicator of false results, but one should pay caution when one cannot reproduce outcomes of scientific research. Three distinct agent types for searching approaches are considered. These types have their unique search rules. The three agents are called: followers, mavericks and replicators. Followers look out for successfully done research and incrementally expand on this knowledge. Mavericks find areas that are not explored already. Lastly, replicators help to correctly identify the best approaches by replicating experiments. As a result, they take away uncertainty. A balance between exploring the landscape and replicating approaches is needed. The model shows that mainly having followers with a low proportion of replicators working on a scientific problem is beneficial. Mavericks are only helpful when scientists are inflexible."
Topological Phases of Interacting Parafermions,"['Rodriguez Aldavero, Juanjo']","['Schuricht, D.']",2023-03-17T01:01:00Z,EN,['parafermions; tensor networks; dmrg; phase diagram; quantum many-body; strongly correlated'],Theoretical Physics,"Parafermion chains are one-dimensional, quantum many-body systems which show
topological phases possessing intriguing properties. For example, they are able to host
quasiparticles with exotic quantum statistics called non-Abelian anyons. Unlike bosons
or fermions, the exchange statistics shown by anyons allows them to modify the state of
the system they are contained in. While Abelian anyons induce a phase change on the
quantum system when they are spatially exchanged, non-Abelian anyons induce unitary
transformations, which allows for the development of applications in fields such as
quantum computing.

In this thesis, the properties of increasingly complex parafermion chains are analysed.
The starting point is given by the Kitaev model and its corresponding spin chain, the
quantum Ising model. Afterwards, its generalizations lead to the discussion of the 3-
state Potts model and the corresponding parafermion chain. Finally, the models are
further generalized by adding extension terms on their respective Hamiltonians. Many
of these models are very challenging to approach by means of analytical methods due
to the presence of strong interactions, so their phase transitions are characterised by
means of numerical methods based on tensor network ansätzen such as the Density Matrix
Renormalization Group (DMRG) or the Multi-Scale Entanglement Renormalization
Ansatz (MERA). The data is then analysed and interpreted using techniques coming from
conformal field theory, finite-size scaling or the real-space renormalization group.
The aim of this thesis is to characterize a region of the phase diagram of a generalized
parafermion chain with two extension terms. A strong emphasis will be placed on the
phase transition given between the trivial and ℤ3-ordered topological phases, as well as
on a feature shown by the topological phase: a parametrized line on which the system is
frustration-free. Along this line, the ground state of the system can be constructed exactly
for arbitrarily large systems and exhibits exact degeneracy, even in the presence of
strong interactions, paving the way for a more precise analysis of the topological properties
of these kinds of models."
Dose-related microstructural changes in metastatic patients measured with diffusion MRI: First insights of the APRICOT trial,"['Ansorena Lujambio, Eli']","['Leemans, Alexander']",2023-03-17T00:00:40Z,EN,['Diffusion;MRI;Tractography;Radiotherapy;Cognition;'],Medical Imaging,"ABSTRACT:

Background: Radiotherapy (RT) is one of the most common therapeutic intervention for cerebral tumor, which also promotes changes in healthy brain structures, leading to cognitive decline in the majority of the patients. In this study, we aim to evaluate the changes in brain microstructure as a result of radiation delivery by means of diffusion MRI (dMRI).
Methods: We selected 9 metastatic patients from the APRICOT trial who underwent both pre-RT and post-RT DWI and T1 scans. We estimated the diffusion metrics for a total of 31 white matter pathways and then evaluated their change as a function of the received dose (%/Gy).
Results: The largest FA and AFD decreases were recorded in the Right Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus, 7,84 %/Gy and the Left Uncinate Fasciculus, 61,09 %/Gy. Regarding the diffusivities, the Right Corticospinal Tract increased the most for all three metrics, MD, AD and RD 4,76 %/Gy, and 5,02 %/Gy and 7,47 %/Gy respectively.
Conclusion: Diffusion metrics are susceptible to radiation delivery, AFD presenting the most notable changes. These findings imply the use of dMRI in better understanding the mechanisms behind structural changes, which may lead to cognitive decline."

The research questions are focused on understanding the function of the concept of inclusion for international students in the search for housing, the types of stereotypes or prejudices that arise during the home search process, and their impact on this procedure. The research utilizes a qualitative methodology, specifically semi-structured interviews of 15 international students. Three important topics were analyzed, including accommodation, prejudice, stereotypes, and communication related to these topics. The results reveal that prejudice significantly impacts the students’ overall consideration of housing. The international students interviewed emphasized the importance of inclusion in securing their own residence, yet they felt minimized in their attempts to do so. Many students expressed feeling excluded by the Dutch student society due to misconceptions and biases, which were often treated humorously. Preconceptions and prejudices were found to be closely related to the housing issue, as they can harm international students' sense of belonging and lead to their exclusion from the Dutch student community. The research highlights a genuine housing difference between foreign and local students, as it is uncommon for them to reside in the same accommodation. The study suggests that further investigation into the concept of inclusion is necessary, with a larger sample size of over 150 participants."
Improving Oryza sativa Ribulose-biphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) Kinetics using a novel directed evolution approach,"['Peeters, Niels']","['Weits, Daan']",2023-03-31T00:00:43Z,EN,['Oryza Sativa – Directed evolution – Escherichia coli – photosynthesis – Rubisco Small-subunit'],Environmental Biology,"To decrease land sacrifice to agriculture and prevent a sixth mass extinction, increasing yields in agricultural crops is essential. Photosynthetic assimilation of CO2 by green plants starts with the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-biphosphate catalysed by the holoenzyme Rubisco. On average, Rubisco is slow and suffers from a low specificity producing glycolate in an oxygenation reaction. Rubisco consist of two subunits: RbcL (large), where the catalytic site is retained, and RbcS (small). Improvement of RbcL has yielded promising results with increases of specificity towards CO2 and increased Kcat. Despite indications for a significant role of RbcS in holoenzyme catalysis and stability, improvement of Rubisco small subunit in plants has been lagging over the past two decades. Here, we present a high-throughput technique to test Rubisco variants in a directed evolution screen using Rubisco-dependent E. coli strains. We explore the Oryza sativa RbcS protein sequence bioinformatically to determine residues of interest involved in holoenzyme structure and functioning. These residues will be randomly mutated and variant libraries are then screened in Rubisco Dependent E. coli strains explicitly designed to assemble rice Rubisco. Improved variants are studied to quantify active sites per sample and carboxylation efficiency after which these variants are tested in vivo in rice plants. Lastly, rice plants are selected for improved phenotypes with increased biomass production and decreased oxygenation rates. These plants could potentially display a larger 4 percent increase in yield and, with the addition of other traits such as water usage, this surge could increase further."
Text Classification of a Small and Imbalanced Dataset With Long Texts,"['Apallius de Vos, Isa']","['Mosteiro Romero, Pablo']",2023-03-30T10:00:42Z,EN,['Text classification; Subject classification; Text mining; NLP; BERT'],Artificial Intelligence,"Text classification describes the process of categorising documents into groups based on certain features in their content. Previous research on this topic has focused on testing how specific data attributes such as data size, class distribution, or document length influence the performance of certain types of classifier, but no research showed any findings on classifier performance if a dataset had many of these attributes at once. This thesis thus focuses on getting more insight into how using a dataset with multiple limiting attributes influences different classification models, and which type of model would work best on a dataset with multiple limiting attributes. To do this, a multi-label dataset of 403 labelled Dutch letters of objection with 24 different labels was created, after which three different simple models (Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM) and a pre-trained language model (BERTje) were trained on the dataset. After testing the models and comparing micro and macro F1-scores, it was found that the language model could not outperform the simpler models on the text classification task. The language of the texts and the class distribution in the dataset were not shown to greatly influence the models' performance, whereas the small data size was found to be the main data attribute limiting the performance of all models. Interestingly, some classifiers could obtain high F1-scores for some of the very small classes in the dataset, indicating that the documents do contain information on those subjects that could easily be extracted by a model if the right technique was used. It is thus proposed to further test the models on individual classes and to inspect a different, rule-based approach to classification to see whether model performance can be improved on this classification task."

And secondly to determine whether predictors measured in childhood could predict cIMT in adolescents in addition to these measurements in adolescence.
Methods: For this study, data was used from a Dutch birth cohort initiated for the Wheezing Illnesses study Leidsche Rijn, in which healthy children were included at birth and follow-up was obtained until the age of 12-16 years for 232 children. Data from physical measurements combined with questionnaires at the age of 5 and 12-16 was included. With this, univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed for the determinants and predictors separately.
Results: As for the determinants, no statistically significant associations were found with carotid intima-media thickness in adolescence, neither in univariable, nor multivariable linear regression analyses. Regarding the predictors, carotid intima-media thickness in childhood was found to be associated with carotid intima-media thickness in adolescence in univariable linear regression analysis (unstandardized beta 0.337 [95% CI 0.032-0.642]) and multivariable linear regression analysis (unstandardized beta 0.412 [95% CI 0.094-0.729]). The other predictors showed no statistically significant association with cIMT in adolescence.
Conclusion: Carotid intima-media thickness in childhood is found to be a significant predictor for carotid intima-media thickness in adolescence.

Ancestral differences in atherosclerotic plaque composition,"['Fahim, Nima']","['Laan, Sander van der']",2023-03-31T00:00:47Z,EN,[],Geneeskunde,"Background: Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death worldwide (World health statics, 2023), which causes an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year. Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of coronary artery disease. Recent studies have shown that individuals from different ancestral groups exhibit significant differences in the prevalence and severity of atherosclerosis, however present data on population differences in plaque composition is scarce. In this study we will examine whether plaque composition differs between European and non-European patients who have undergone an endarterectomy procedure. 
Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of two datasets of a large non-academic teaching hospital and an academic hospital in the Netherlands. We will use data from the Athero-Express Biobank study and the Athero-Express Genomics Study. The primary histological phenotype will be Plaque Vulnerability Index. Ordinal logistic regression was used to assess the effect of ancestry on plaque composition while adjusting for confounding factors. The factors were included patient’s ancestry, age and gender.
Results: The result of the ordinal logistic regression analysis indicates that patients with a non-European ethnicity have higher risk of being in higher Plaque Vulnerability Index scale, compared to patients with a non-European ethnicity. The analysis showed a statistically significant difference (odds ratio 2.48, 95% CI 1.37-4.49, p-value 0.003) after adjusting for gender, age, used chips and year of operation. 
Conclusion: Our analysis showed that Europeans had significantly lower risk for plaque instability. These changes in plaque composition include more fat, more intraplaque hemorrhage, more macrophages, and less smooth muscle cells."

Investigations Into the Immunomodulatory Mechanisms of Human Milk Extracellular Vesicles on CD4+ T Cells,"['Vincelot, Martin']","['Wauben, Marca']",2023-05-01T00:00:38Z,EN,['human milk; EVs; Extracellular Vesicles; immunomodulation; CD4+ T cell activation; Triple parameter reporter cell line; Jurkats; T cell signaling'],Infection and Immunity,"From birth onwards, the adaptive immune system of the mucosal surfaces of human infants undergoes a massive increase in antigen exposure. To avoid its over-activation, human milk plays a major role in the establishment of mucosal immune tolerance. Milk Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) were recently hypothesized to contribute to such immunomodulation as they were shown to increase the stimulation threshold required for activation of CD4+ T helper cells. EVs are nanosized lipid-bilayered vesicles known to mediate intercellular communication. The exact mechanisms by which these EVs modulate T cell activation are unknown. However, the transient and reversible dynamics of this inhibition, and the results of a recent milk EV proteomic analysis suggest that the EV contains a ‘ready-to-act’ protein cargo which interferes with signaling pathways of T cell activation upon delivery. To investigate the potentially immunomodulatory nature of the milk EV protein cargo, an in-silico analysis of the proteome was performed to identify the candidates for further analysis. Additionally, a Jurkat reporter cell line was optimized to efficiently measure EV-mediated immunomodulation of three canonical pathways of T cell activation. This read-out system confirmed that milk EVs cause a two-fold reduction in TCR-derived pathways and a three-fold reduction in CD28-derived pathways. It also revealed that milk EVs from allergic donors are not able to inhibit CD4+ T cell activation as well as milk EVs from non-allergic donors. Overall, a better understanding of milk-EV mediated immunomodulation could greatly enhance medical advice on breastfeeding and prevent the plethora of illnesses associated with over-activation of immunity."
Measuring changes in tissue oxygen metabolism due to radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases,"['Leeuw, Jordi de']","['Bhogal, Alex']",2023-05-01T00:00:41Z,EN,['Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2); oxygen extraction fraction (OEF);\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI); quantitative blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging\n(qBOLD); quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM); susceptibility; QSM+qBOLD (QQ)'],Medical Imaging,"The human brain plays a crucial role in the regulation and coordination of various bodily functions. It requires up to 20% of the total energy of the body to carry out its complex operations. This makes the brain the most energetically demanding organ of the body. When the brain tissue wants to produce more energy, it can primarily use two mechanisms. Either it increases the blood flow, or it can increase the amount of oxygen it extracts from the red blood cells. Usually in healthy tissue, the blood flow and the amount of used oxygen is perfectly balanced. This balance of blood flow and amount of used oxygen can be described as the ‘activity’ of the tissue. However, in patients with brain tumors, the blood flow, amount of oxygen extracted and therefore the ‘activity’ changes. In tumor tissue, for example, new vessels grow very fast with inconsistent diameter, abnormal bends and occasionally dead-ends. This results in some areas inside the tumor which may not get enough blood supply and therefore those areas should have to increase the amount of oxygen they get from the blood cells to carry out their tasks. 
Often radiotherapy is used to kill a tumor. However, the radiation often also damages healthy tissue, especially the blood vessels. As a result, the vessels may not be able to increase the blood flow anymore when needed and thus, if the healthy tissue needs more oxygen, it has to receive more oxygen from the red blood cells. Changes in the oxygen supply to the tissue can be picked up with an MRI scanner. The scanner identifies the change in the amount of oxygen-carrying blood cells in the brain. When the brain uses more oxygen, there will be less oxygen-carrying blood cells in the veins. 
In this research, we will investigate what the difference is in healthy tissue versus tumor tissue. We will describe the differences in terms of the ‘activity’ and the change in amount of oxygen-carrying blood cells. Next to that, we will also investigate the effects of radiotherapy on the healthy- and tumor tissue by scanning the patients before- and a few months after radiotherapy. The results of both scans will be compared to describe the effects that radiotherapy has on the healthy- and tumor tissue.
The results show that the brain, excluding the tumors, is more active after radiotherapy. We expected that this would happen, since the brain tissue was damaged by the radiotherapy and is trying to repair itself. Next to that, we found that tumor tissue uses less oxygen compared to healthy tissue. However, because the strangely-formed blood vessels are not close to all tumor cells, we expected that tumor tissue would get more oxygen from the red blood cells to give all tumor cells enough oxygen. This difference in our expectations is probably due to a change in the way that the tumor cells produce energy, which typically uses less oxygen. Finally, we found that the amount of radiation does not change the ‘activity’ of the tissue or a change in oxygen-carrying blood cells. This can be explained by the fact that the brain tissue is indeed damaged by the radiotherapy, but that the brain is capable of tweaking the blood flow or the amount of oxygen it takes from the blood cells in order to keep the ‘activity’ stable.
In conclusion, we were able to describe the relationship of oxygen use and the amount of ‘activity’ in both healthy tissue and tumor tissue, and their changes after radiotherapy."

Ionic nanopores that connect aqueous electrolytes exhibit memristive behaviour and can be used as an actual realisation of a volatile memristor. In this thesis a general model for the conductivity and the hysteresis behaviour of memristors is developed from first principles. This model is applied to ionic nanopores, with consideration of the effect of changing the pore geometry and the frequency of the applied periodic voltage. To test the accuracy of the model, it is compared to finite-element calculations on cone-shaped and hourglass-shaped ionic nanopores. The analytic model is successful in predicting the number of crossings present in the hysteresis loops of pores with varying geometry, produced via finite-element calculations, and it revealed the role capacitive elements play in maintaining zero-crossing behaviour in memristors. We strongly encourage further experimental research into the memristive behaviour of nanopores."
Searching for Biomarkers: On Using Form and Content of Expressive Language in Diagnosis of Schizophrenia and Assessment of Risk of Psychosis,"['Brueijs, Sabine de']","['Wijnen, Frank']",2023-05-02T00:00:42Z,EN,['natural language processing; biomarkers; schizophrenia; psychosis; review'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Diagnosing psychiatric conditions is not completely objective, leaving much room for misdiagnosis to occur. Part of what causes this, is the absence of biomarkers for psychiatric conditions. In recent years, efforts have been made to find biomarkers for schizophrenia and psychosis based on expressive language. Here, an overview of studies on this topic from the past five years (2017-2022) is provided. The research questions were “Can the form and content of expressive language be used to help diagnose schizophrenia?” and “What aspects of expressive language are the most informative regarding assessment of risk of conversion to psychosis?”. The results of the literature search suggest analysis of expressive language can be used to recognize schizophrenia in individual patients and to assess whether someone is close to experiencing a psychotic episode. In addition, it seems that mainly semantics and discourse organization are of interest. However, there are indications that findings of studies may be poorly generalizable over languages and individuals. This is a problem that needs to be solved before language can be reliably used as a biomarker in the clinical practice."

Daarentegen blijkt uit de resultaten van de master thesis dat de didactiek van het toekomstgericht onderwijs nog erg in de kinderschoenen staat. Er bestaat nog geen schoolcultuur waarin leerlingen worden uitgedaagd na te denken over verschillende toekomsten aan de hand van ontwerpopdrachten. Dit heeft ermee te maken dat het denken in scenario’s over de toekomst in verbinding staat met de zogenaamde ‘hogere orde denkvaardigheden’, namelijk het niveau van creëren. Eerstegraads docenten aardrijkskunde erkennen de relevantie van hogere orde denkvaardigheden in de lespraktijk, maar worden hierbij beperkt door het curriculum doordat dit soort vaardigheden niet worden getoetst op het centraal eindexamen aardrijkskunde. Daarnaast bestaat er een handelingsverlegenheid onder docenten aardrijkskunde op het gebied van het toekomstgericht denken, doordat zij onvoldoende didactische handvatten hebben om dit te verwezenlijken in de lespraktijk. 
In reeds bestaande onderzoeken van het toekomstgericht onderwijs lijken maatschappelijke vraagstukken, zoals klimaatverandering, zich veelal te richten op de sociale kant van de geografie. Daarnaast redeneren leerlingen veelal op basis van gebrekkige (achtergrond)kennis op het moment dat zij de toekomst verkennen. Hetgeen dat mist in dit soort dergelijke onderzoeken is een verbinding met de fysisch geografische dimensie van het vak aardrijkskunde, een aanbod aan feitelijke kennis uit kaarten, een huidige situatie als uitgangspunt in de toekomstscenario’s van de leerlingen en tevens de integratie van de eigen (leef)omgeving. Op het moment dat we leerlingen willen leren over effectieve klimaatadaptatie strategieën in Nederland is het raadzaam, om net als in de praktijk, hen rekening te laten houden met het Nederlands landschap en daarbij behorend het bodem- en watersysteem. 
Op basis van het bovengenoemde is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld, namelijk: “Wat zijn de kenmerken van een geschikt educatief ontwerp voor het ontwikkelen van toekomstgerichte denkcompetenties ten aanzien van de grote ruimtelijke opgaven in Nederland in relatie tot klimaatverandering en grootschalige klimaatadaptatie”? De onderzoeksvraag van de master thesis is beantwoord door middel van de inzet van een ‘Educational Design Research’. Hierbij is er een interventie ontwikkeld voor de (onderwijs)praktijk van het vak aardrijkskunde. De interventie betreft een lessenreeks voor de leerlingen in de bovenbouw zes vwo woonachtig in de omgeving van West-Brabant, derhalve de eigen (leef)omgeving. In zes lessen tijd ontwikkelen de leerlingen een gewenst toekomstperspectief van de ruimtelijke inrichting. Tevens zijn de deelgebieden van het toekomstgericht onderwijs, onderwijs over watervraagstukken in Nederland en onderwijs over klimaatverandering voor het eerst geïntegreerd tot één praktische opdracht. 
Gedurende het onderzoeksproces hebben verschillende vakdidactici, eerstegraads docenten aardrijkskunde en leerlingen in de bovenbouw zes vwo het ontwerp als relevant en waardevol beoordeeld voor de (onderwijs)praktijk. De lessenreeks betreft hierbij een ontwerpopdracht in de eigen (leef)omgeving van de leerlingen, waarbij de leerlingen de mate van geschiktheid voor de drie grote ruimtevragers (woningbouwopgave, landbouwtransitie en natuurontwikkeling) beoordelen aan de hand van de drie geschiktheidskaarten van Deltares en overige fysische kaarten. Daarnaast vergelijken de leerlingen het eigen scenario met een grootschalige klimaatadaptatie strategie van Deltares, waarbij zij de schetskaarten vervolgens bijstellen en tevens een grootschalige adaptatiestrategie toepassen in de schetskaarten in combinatie met de drie grote ruimtelijke opgaven."
"Prevalence and distribution of long-term opioid therapy in primary care in Uppsala county, Sweden: a retrospective observational study.","['Broere, Maarten']","['Bouvy, M.L.']",2023-05-05T00:00:58Z,EN,['Opioids; long-term opioid therapy; prescription data'],Farmacie,"Introduction: Due to the global increase in opioid prescription rates and the parallel increase in opioid misuse, abuse and opioid-related deaths in many countries, attention on reducing irrational opioid use has become more predominant. Because of the risks related to opioid use and limited evidence for prolonged analgesic effects, the use of long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) in patients with chronic non-cancer pain is questionable. In Sweden, information about the number of patients that are currently on LTOT, how these are distributed among the primary care practices, and what type of opioids that are being prescribed, is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence and distributions of adult patients with LTOT in primary care practices in Uppsala county, Sweden and to investigate the type, quantity and trends of opioid prescriptions in these patients.

Methods: A retrospective study of opioid prescription data was conducted using data from both regional (Region Uppsala) and national (Socialstyrelsen) prescription databases in Sweden. The study population consisted of adult patients in Uppsala county with at least one opioid prescription between 01-06-2021 until 31-05-2022 (Region Uppsala) and 01-01-2016 until 01-09-2022 (Socialstyrelsen). LTOT prevalence rates were calculated by dividing the number of identified LTOT patients with the total number of enlisted patients. ATC-codes of different opioids were used to calculate the total number of prescriptions, users and total prescribed defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants for all opioids. Descriptive statistics were used to examine patient characteristics and opioid use. A Chi-square test was performed to analyze the difference of LTOT prevalence rates between individual primary care practices.

Results: LTOT prevalence rates of 0.77% and 1.13% were reported for the regional and national dataset, respectively. LTOT prevalence rates differed between public primary care practices. Between 2016 and 2021, an increasing trend in the number of prescriptions, users and total prescribed DDD was mainly found for oxycodone and buprenorphine. 

Conclusion: LTOT prevalence rates among adult patients in primary care in Uppsala county varied between 0.77% and 1.13% and LTOT patients were not equally distributed among public primary care practices. The use of stronger opioids increased substantially between 2016 and 2021 in Uppsala county, Sweden. Oxycodone and buprenorphine showed the most pronounced increases, whereas only tramadol showed a decreasing trend. Our findings show similarities with results from other European studies, reporting an indication for a shifting trend from the prescription of weaker opioids to stronger opioids. Although our numbers and trends need to be interpreted with caution, the results underline the importance of close monitoring if benefits still outweigh risks and if treatment rationale of opioid use still applies."
Queer Representation in Disney’s Recent Feature-Length Films: A Visual Discourse Analysis,"['Westerop, Tessa van']","['Giordano, Carlo']",2023-05-05T00:00:56Z,EN,['Queerness; representation; (cultural) stereotyping; visual discourse analysis; Disney.'],Interculturele communicatie,"This research investigates and decodes Disney’s representation of queerness in four of its recent animated and live-action films, namely Cruella (2021), Jungle Cruise (2021), Lightyear (2022) and Strange World (2022). It uses queer theory, imagology, and stereotypical tropes (twelve in total, divided into seven categories) to conduct a qualitative visual discourse analysis and close viewing of the films. It aimed to conclude how Disney represents queerness in its recent feature-length films but found that there is no one way of describing Disney’s queer representation in its recent films. It did, however, observe some patterns. Most notably, it found that Disney is no longer using queer characters as its villains in any of its recent films, which is a significant change from its older films. Moreover, it found that there is a noticeable difference between Disney’s animated films and its live-action films. The animated films portray a more fluid and inclusive image of queerness by including, for example, non-white queer characters and not making use of rigid stereotypes. These portrayals, however, do often border on a sense of tokenism, and leave the queer characters relatively one-dimensional. The live-action films, on the other hand, make more use of the stereotypical tropes, which results in a more rigid, limited and often subservient representation of queerness. However, on the other hand, these representations also touch upon some more ‘realistic’ aspects of queerness, and the characters’ queerness often influences their storylines."
"Assessing Eolian Snow Redistribution in Din-Gad Catchment, Central Himalaya, using Remote Sensing and Modelling","['Dijk, Luc van']","['Kraaijenbrink, Philip']",2023-05-05T00:00:49Z,EN,['hydrology; snow dynamics; snow redistribution; wind fields; remote sensing; modelling'],Earth Surface and Water,"The Himalaya are amongst the world’s most important water towers, supplying water to hundreds of millions of people. They are also vulnerable to climate change, stimulating research on their hydrological behaviour. One important aspect of the hydrological system that is often overlooked in these studies is the eolian redistribution of snow. This study aims to identify eolian snow redistribution patterns using an unprecedented combination of optical remote sensing, downscaled wind fields, a Temperature Index (TI)-based hydrological model (SPHY) and a novel Snow Redistribution mechanism Classification Model (SRCM). This method was applied to Din-Gad Catchment in the Central Himalaya for the period 2017-2020. The results show that eolian snow redistribution patterns are strongly related to the prevailing wind directions and topographic exposure. The most frequent wind-induced snow removal typically occurs in concentrated areas that are exposed in the wind direction, whereas areas of frequent wind-supplied snow deposition are more widespread and located in sheltered areas like valleys and the lee sides of ridges. The wind speed threshold for snow transport is low during the winter months and increases in the monsoon season, due to the increasing age and wetness of the snowpack in that period. SRCM classified 21.6% of snow cover changes as wind-driven and 14.1% as gravity-driven. The classified snow redistribution mechanisms were evaluated using satellite images, finding that SPHY had difficulty classifying observed snow cover changes with the chosen model parameters. This indicates that modelling snow cover change using only temperature and precipitation data is an oversimplification and that wind-induced snow dynamics play a significant role in the spatiotemporal distribution of snow cover in Din-Gad Catchment. This also suggests that TI-based hydrological models like SPHY could benefit from the incorporation of snow redistribution processes. Recommendations for improving these methods include using radar imagery, incorporating field observations and performing sensitivity analyses and error propagation tests. This study contributes to understanding the role of snow redistribution in high-mountain areas, which is critical for designing accurate models that can make reliable predictions of hydrological behaviour."
Perceived Algorithmic Fairness using Organizational Justice Theory: an Empirical Case Study on Algorithmic Hiring,"['Juijn, Guusje']","['Nguyen, Dong']",2023-05-05T00:00:54Z,EN,['algorithmic fairness; algorithmic decision-making; algorithmic hiring; organizational justice'],Artificial Intelligence,"Growing concerns about the fairness of algorithmic decision-making systems have prompted a proliferation of mathematical formulations aimed at remedying algorithmic bias. Yet, integrating mathematical fairness alone into algorithms is insufficient to ensure their acceptance, trust, and support by humans. It is also essential to understand what humans perceive as fair. In this study, I therefore conduct an empirical user study into crowdworkers’ algorithmic fairness perceptions, focusing on algorithmic hiring. I build on perspectives from organizational justice theory, which categorizes fairness into distributive, procedural, and interactional components. By grouping participants based on the type of information they receive about several hypothetical recruitment algorithms, I find that algorithmic fairness perceptions are higher when crowdworkers are provided not only with information about the algorithmic outcome but also about the decision-making process. Remarkably, this effect is even observed when the decision-making process can be considered unfair, when gender, a sensitive attribute, is used as a main feature. By showing realistic trade-offfs between fairness criteria, I find a preference for equalizing false negatives over equalizing selection rates amongst groups. Moreover, I discover a negative effect of selection rate differences and false negative rate differences on fairness perceptions. These findings contribute to the literature on the connection between mathematical algorithmic fairness and perceived algorithmic fairness, and highlight the importance of considering multiple components of algorithmic fairness, rather than solely treating it as an outcome distribution problem. Importantly, this study highlights the potential benefits of leveraging organizational justice theory to enhance the evaluation of perceived algorithmic fairness."

Since then, several alarming reports came out, saying that Dutch adolescents were coping with more mental distress. Meanwhile, researchers noticed changes in substance use, possibly to cope with this distress. This current research aimed to investigate if cannabis use has changed during the first lockdown in Dutch middle schoolers, and if certain factors, e.g., level of self-control, time spend with friends, perceived parental monitoring, and perceived descriptive norms, at T1 (Jan-2020) were predictive of lifetime cannabis use at T2 (Jan-2022). The study is a two waved longitudinal study, with a sample size of 404 high schoolers aged 12-17 from a Dutch municipality. The study found that cannabis use increased during the first lockdown. Adolescents with a lower level of self-control or who spent more time with friends at T1 had an increased risk of lifetime cannabis use at T2. These results provide new insights into how prevention makers might reduce adolescent cannabis use through self-control, parental monitoring and supervised leisure activities. Importantly, it also emphasizes the importance to keep an eye on adolescents during times of crisis."

Often, those targets are very ambitious and reached towards 2030 or 2050, but lack concrete measures for the construction and development of housing. One of the municipalities with ambitious sustainability targets is the city of Rotterdam. This research focuses on how the municipality can implement the complex sustainability targets into housing programmes by examining the case of the Motorstraatgebied, an area where the implementation of sustainability targets is an important part of realising housing construction programmes. Document analysis on relevant policies, together with in-depth interviews with stakeholders as well as experts and participatory observations during two stakeholder sessions in the Motorstraatgebied, resulted in recommendations for policy and planning practice. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of the involvement of actors in an early stage of the (re)development process. By building a relationship, trust between actors can grow. When the actors, municipality and others, trust each other, sustainability targets can be met through housing programmes without having to write them down in legal contracts. One of the most important indicators for the implementation of sustainability targets in the municipality of Rotterdam is therefore the trust relationship."

Community-focused spaces (co-spaces) are distinguished as the core of many digital nomads. By spending time in selected co-spaces and participating in digital nomad events, observations are made. Respondents are selected and interviewed to draw conclusions about digital nomad sociodemographic characteristics,
mobility trajectories, the infrastructure used, and the connectedness with the host society. We distinguish that this emerging and rapidly growing segment of the digital workforce is involved in local activities and we identify specific local hubs of connectedness, which are critical in facilitating social and occupational
links between the locals and the ‘nomads’. We also shed light on engagement with the local communities and the social networks of digital nomads within the innovative context of Medellin and the city's latest transition towards the knowledge economy."
"Regulatory opportunities for treating age-related macular degeneration with bevacizumab

Despite its inclusion in the WHO essential medicines list, bevacizumab remains mostly inaccessible to nAMD patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), partly due to regulatory hurdles preventing bevacizumab from being registered in LMICs.  This paper assesses whether LMIC-oriented regulatory pathways like EU-M4all are effective tools for overcoming these hurdles and improving patient access to bevacizumab or bevacizumab biosimilars in LMICs.

We found that while multiple LMIC-oriented regulatory pathways are available, they are generally aimed at addressing acute public health issues in the short-term. As a result, bevacizumab would likely not meet the eligibility criteria for most of them due to either its limited perceived urgency, pathways being solely aimed at specific therapeutic areas (e.g., HIV), or pathways not allowing biological products. This is unfortunate since nAMD poses an ever-increasing disease- and economic burden to LMICs. Therefore, we suggest stringent national regulatory authorities to either extend the scope of their existing pathways, or design novel ones aimed gradually worsening, non-acute, disease burdens like the one nAMD causes."

In this study, P–T conditions were determined based on specific bulk rock compositions from each metamorphic zone in order to give new insights on the relations between the different zones. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and major and trace element analyses were performed to determine mineral assemblages and bulk rock compositions for samples from each of the metamorphic zones. The whole-rock chemistry of the samples was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and Laser Ablation Inducted Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Thermodynamic Perple_X modelling was applied to estimate metamorphic conditions from each zone. This resulted in P–T conditions of 1.0–2.5 kbar and 400–500°C in the lowest grade (chlorite) zone and up to 3.8–4.3 kbar and 650–680°C in the highest grade (sillimanite–K-felspar) zone. In the pelitic rocks of this zone, unstable muscovite reacted with cordierite to form new biotite and prismatic sillimanite, possibly at temperatures close to the solidus. Trace element data indicate that no partial melting took place in the highest-grade samples. Actual contact metamorphism did not take place in the samples, but temperature could have increased locally thanks to the heat of intruding granitoid bodies. Retrograde metamorphism created a new muscovite phase when temperatures dropped below at least 655°C again. As retrograde conditions reached greenschist facies conditions, temperature probably dropped below at least 500°C. Over a distance of 2.75 km, a metamorphic field gradient was determined at 62°C/km."
Semantic-Aware Person Inpainting Using Generative Adversarial Networks,"['Doel, Derk van den']","['Poppe, Ronald']",2023-05-27T00:00:54Z,EN,"['GAN, Generative Adversarial Network, inpainting, anonymization, semantic segmentation']",Artificial Intelligence,"The widespread use of street view imagery in various applications, such as urban planning, navigation,
and real estate, has raised concerns about the privacy of individuals captured in these images. While
anonymization methods, such as blurring or pixelation, are commonly used to address these concerns, they
often result in a loss of important information and can be easily circumvented by determined individuals.
This thesis aims to explore an alternative approach to protecting privacy in street view imagery by using
image inpainting techniques. Image inpainting involves filling in missing or obscured regions of an image
in a way that preserves the overall structure and context of the scene. The proposed approach will utilize
conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) for the purpose of image inpainting, specifically in
the context of street view images where people have been removed. While current cGAN-based methods
rely solely on incomplete images with missing areas, our approach incorporates an additional source
of information in the form of a semantic segmentation map. The semantic segmentation map serves
as a prior to guide the inpainting process, allowing the model to better understand the context and
structure of the image. By utilizing both the incomplete image and the semantic segmentation map, we
aim to improve the quality and realism of the inpainted results. We compared the performance of our
two proposed models, SemGAN and SemGAN-GT, with the existing pix2pix method. SemGAN utilizes
inpainted semantic segmentation maps as a prior in image inpainting, while SemGAN-GT uses ground
truth semantic segmentation maps. We evaluated the performance of each method using established
image quality metrics, such as L1, SSIM, and PSNR, as well as a qualitative analysis of the inpainted
images. Our findings indicate that both SemGAN and SemGAN-GT outperform the pix2pix method in
terms of image quality and realism. This suggests that semantic information improves the quality and 
realism of the inpainted results, based on our quantitative results and qualitative analysis."
Impact of lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 lockdown on sleep patterns: a population-based study in the Netherlands from the IMPACT project,"['Sandoval Diez, Nekane']","['Gehring, Ulrike']",2023-05-31T23:01:07Z,EN,['sleep patterns; lifestyle changes; well-being; COVID-19 pandemic; anti-COVID-19 measures; lockdown stringency'],Epidemiology,"Background: Although there is scientific evidence of an increased prevalence of sleep disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, we still have limited information on how lifestyle factors might have affected sleep patterns. Therefore, we aimed to identify pandemic-driven lifestyle changes and their potential impact on sleep in the adult population.
Methods: Three Dutch cohorts were followed through monthly questionnaires provided in a mobile application that inquired about lifestyle determinants (physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, electronic device use, and social media use) and sleep (latency, duration, and quality). The stringency of anti-COVID-19 measures was analysed using the Containment and Health Index (CHI). To assess the association between lifestyle determinants and CHI with sleep, adjusted ordinal response models were fitted using frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. 
Results: A higher CHI (expressed by one Interquartile Range increase, CHI-IQR) was associated with a 47% increase in the odds of spending more time using electronic devices (OR: 1.47, CI: 1.40-1.53), a 6% decrease in the odds of exercising more hours per week (OR: 0.94, CI: 0.90-0.98) and with 37% fewer odds of consuming alcohol more frequently (OR: 0 .63, CI: 0.60-0.66). CHI-IQR increase was further associated with longer sleep duration (OR: 1.11, CI: 1.05-1.16). Lower frequency of alcohol consumption and higher levels of electronic device and social media use were associated with longer sleep latencies, while lower physical activity levels and increased use of social media and electronic devices were related to poorer sleep quality and shorter sleep duration. 
Conclusions: The measures applied against COVID-19 were related to changes in lifestyle in terms of physical activity, alcohol consumption and electronic device use, as well as to a modest increase in sleep duration. Increased electronic device use and decreased levels of physical activity and alcohol consumption were related to longer sleep latencies and poorer sleep quality during the pandemic."
"Mother milk use in the perioperative period, is there an association with NEC? A retrospective cohort study.","['Beeten, Tess van de']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-05-30T00:00:38Z,EN,[],Geneeskunde,"Background
Patients with a congenital heart disease (CHD) are at high risk for developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) due to the decreased perfusion to the intestines. To limit the risk of NEC, nutrition, and specific mother milk, is an important factor. Due to its many benefits for the neonate. Therefore, we investigated if there is any association between mother milk and the risk of developing NEC in patients with a CHD.

Method
A retrospective cohort study was performed of all newborns admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and the high care cardiology ward of the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital (WKZ) between 2017 and 2022 with a congenital heart disease (CHD) and who needed a heart surgery within the first 6 weeks of life. Nutritional information and relevant covariates were collected. Patients were divided in two cohorts based on the development of NEC. The cohorts were analyzed using different statistic tests.

Results
270 patients met the inclusion criteria, 36 developed NEC. The mean value (ml/kg/day) in patients with NEC was lower than in patients without NEC. There was a significant difference in feeding type between the patients with and without NEC in the period postnatal, and overall (p= 0.0352 respectively p= 0.0058). The periods post first surgery and post second surgery did not show any significant difference (p= 0.5991 respectively p= 0.0863). After pairwise comparing a significant difference was seen between only formula and a combination in the overall period (OR 2.69 95% CI 1.20-6.38, p=0.019). And a significance difference was seen between only formula and a combination in the postnatal period (OR 13.82 95% CI 2.31-146.4, p=0.00).

Conclusion
Patients with NEC are more likely to be formula fed. And patients with NEC have a lower mean value (ml/kg/day) intake compared to patients without NEC.
But due to the limitations of this retrospective cohort study no firm conclusion can be drawn about an association between type and/or amount of feeding between patients with and without NEC."

My research critically examines the efficacy of two VR experiences; Symbiosis and Tree, in generating empathy and encouraging pro-environmental behaviour. Using Fairclough’s Critical Discourse Analysis as my methodology, I suggest an affordance analysis for the first layer, instead of the usual textual analysis. The findings suggest that while VR offers immersive experiences, it is limited by developers’ biases and lacks concrete solutions to systemic issues.

Ovulation induction with letrozole in women with polycystic ovary syndrome,"['Aalberts, Joanne']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-05-29T23:00:49Z,EN,['Ovulation-induction; PCOS; letrozole'],Geneeskunde,"Study question: What is the effectiveness of first-line letrozole treatment in anovulatory women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and what ovulation induction protocols are followed in Dutch fertility clinics?
Relevance and methods: This study was done to determine the feasibility of a randomized trial comparing prolonged letrozole treatment with switching to gonadotrophins in women ovulating but not getting pregnant on first-line treatment with letrozole. We evaluated an individual participant database consisting of data from all studies that had compared letrozole to clomiphene citrate in randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, we developed a questionnaire for a national survey to assess the current protocols on ovulation induction in Dutch fertility clinics.
Interpretation of results and conclusion: In women with polycystic ovary syndrome, letrozole is more effective than clomiphene citrate in terms of both ovulation rates and live birth rates among ovulating women. With about half of the ovulating women achieving live birth on first-line letrozole treatment and given the willingness of Dutch clinics to participate in a trial, we consider a randomized controlled trial comparing letrozole versus gonadotrophins as second-line treatment after ovulation on a first-line letrozole treatment in the Netherlands to be relevant and feasible."
Local versus extra-local representation of Holocene vegetation change in North-East Germany,"['Hoffman, Catrien']","['Giesecke, Thomas']",2023-05-31T23:00:58Z,EN,[],Environmental Biology,"Contrasting results from studies on triggers of the postglacial expansion of Fagus sylvatica reveal that either the processes connected to this expansion were different across Europe or that these processes were acting on different spatial scales. These hypotheses are tested in this study by comparing the representation of the expansion of F. sylvatica in two pollen diagrams that represent the development of the Peutscher forest in NE Germany at different spatial scales. The results show that the expansion and its triggers are differently represented in both pollen diagrams but also show that the processes connected to this expansion were different across Europe. In northern Europe, the expansion was mainly controlled by anthropogenic activities while climate was the most important trigger in central- and southern Europe. These results question the validity of nature-based forest management strategies that sustain beech-forests and imply that the promotion of other tree taxa such as linden, that was a more important forest component before anthropogenic disturbance, has a stronger claim of being nature-based."
Iraanse en westerse feministische fotografie: Onderzoek naar de relatie tussen Iraanse en westerse vrouwelijke feministische fotografen,"['Beek, Manon van']","['Bavelaar, Hestia']",2023-07-01T01:01:29Z,NL,"['fotografie, feminisme, Iran, Westen, Shirin Neshat, Susan Meiselas, Shadi Ghadirian, Cindy Sherman, Newsha Tavakolian, Bieke Depoorter,']",Kunstgeschiedenis,"Binnen de museale sector wordt recentelijk aandacht besteed aan Iraanse feministische fotografes door vanaf 2006 verschillende tentoonstellingen te wijden aan dit onderwerp. Het is echter opvallend dat er relatief weinig is gepubliceerd over Iraanse feministische fotografie en over onderlinge invloeden van westerse feministische fotografes en Iraanse feministische fotografes. Deze scriptie legt de focus op de relatie tussen hedendaagse Iraanse feministische fotografie en westerse feministische fotografie waarbij de volgende hoofdvraag centraal staat: In hoeverre is er een relatie tussen westerse feministische fotografie en hedendaagse Iraanse feministische fotografie die de vierde feministische golf heeft beïnvloed? Het Westen behelst binnen dit onderzoek de Verenigde Staten en Europa.
Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat hoe hedendaagser de fotografes zijn, hoe moderner de foto’s en hoe meer de onderlinge beïnvloeding zichtbaar wordt. De vergelijkingen tussen de drie westerse feministische fotografes, Susan Meiselas, Cindy Sherman en Bieke Depoorter, en de drie Iraanse feministische fotografes, Shirin Neshat, Shadi Ghadirian en Newsha Tavakolian, tonen aan dat de fotografes duidelijk verbonden zijn aan hun achtergrond en daardoor beïnvloed worden door het verloop van de geschiedenis van de fotografie en het feminisme. Zo staan de oudste feministische fotografes uit het Westen en Iran verder van elkaar dan de jongste feministische fotografes.
Het is opvallend dat fotografie een belangrijk middel is voor Iraanse feministische vrouwen om zich artistiek te uiten en middels dit medium kritiek te leveren op de sociaal-politieke kwesties in Iran. Zoals uit dit onderzoek blijkt voelen zowel westerse als Iraanse vrouwen zich binnen fotografie niet overheerst door mannelijke dominantie en genieten zij meer bekendheid dan in bijvoorbeeld schilderkunst. Iran kent echter meer sociaal-politieke beperkingen dan het Westen, waardoor Iraanse vrouwen het medium fotografie pas later zijn gaan gebruiken. Dit heeft als gevolg dat naarmate de tijd vordert de Iraanse vrouwen steeds meer vrijheid genieten en dat ze steeds jonger starten met fotograferen.
Een ander verband tussen westerse feministische fotografie en hedendaagse Iraanse feministische fotografie is te zien in de thematiek van de fotografes, zoals de verwijzing naar de eigen feministische geschiedenis en de onderdrukking van de vrouw. Naargelang de tijd vordert, hoe meer de uitwerking van de thema’s in de fotografie van de westerse fotografes en de Iraanse fotografes naar elkaar toe lijken te groeien. De belangrijkste oorzaak van de relatie is te danken aan de huidige tijd waarin er globalisering plaatsvindt en internet het makkelijker maakt om beelden te verspreiden."

The MCL that controls motivation includes connections from the VTA to the NAc and the mPFC. It is unknown how the MCL is altered in depressed individuals or experimental animals to lead to anhedonia. I intend to find convergent mechanisms in different animal models of stress, which can explain the development of anhedonia in depressed patients. Chronic stress can be modelled through either the CUMS or CSDS paradigm. CUMS-susceptible animals show reduced neuroplasticity and VTA dopaminergic hypoactivity, while CSDS-susceptible animals show increased neuroplasticity and VTA dopaminergic hyperactivity. The resilient animals show similar dopaminergic activity and neuroplasticity as stress-naïve animals.

These contradictory findings can still become a convergent mechanism through the consistent reduction in NAc activity in both models. The NAc of CUMS animals received reduced input from the VTA and the NAc of CSDS animals received excessive BDNF signalling leading to reduced activity of the NAc MSNs."
"Credits core? Lending by local credit cooperatives in the Netherlands, c.1900-1920","['Hall, Johan van']","['Bochove, Christiaan van']",2023-07-01T01:01:31Z,EN,"['Credit cooperatives in the Netherlands, lending, banking']",Geschiedenis van Politiek en Maatschappij,"The common view is that the emergence and growth of credit cooperatives in the Netherlands is a success story. The explanation hereof is debated still. This research examines four early established credit cooperatives with a focus on their primary aim of existence, that is their lending business. The research question is which mechanisms explain the lending activities and resulting loan portfolios of local credit cooperatives in the Netherlands, c.1900-1920. The early established local banks in Borne, Bornerbroek, Heeze, and Westerbork, located in three different geographical regions of the country, are used as case studies for this purpose. 
The central cooperatives, Centrale Banken, offered a foundational framework with the governance, products, accounting, and oversight for all their local banks. Intentionally, the local banks all operated within a certain bandwidth thereof. Reality was very different; the narrative of the early credit cooperatives in the Netherlands was marked by diversity. The main drivers for this divergence were first and foremost, the fully autonomous local credit cooperatives all implementing their own interpretation of the cooperative structure without their Centrale Banken in the position of correcting this. Secondly, the framework was incomplete which urged the banks’ boards to make critical choices about credit- and risk management issues. Finally, the local credit demand varied considerably amongst the banks. This resulted in very differently sized loan portfolios with each very dissimilar characteristics.
Though all banks examined pursued their main reason for existence, the common view of the success of the early credit cooperatives in the Netherlands must be nuanced. It was not one narrative of steady and successful growth, but many and very different local tales."
Real-world Evidence and Network Meta-analysis for the Effectiveness of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab for Hospitalised Patients with COVID-19,"['Read, Christina']","['Debray, T.P.A.']",2023-07-01T01:01:35Z,EN,[],Epidemiology,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the strain it placed on healthcare systems highlighted a key role for real-world data in quickly generating health evidence. A growing demand for large-scale health analytics has also resulted in the existence of large health data networks and opportunities for the incorporation of both randomised and non-randomised evidence in the health regulation decision-making process. This study collected non-randomised evidence on COVID-19 treatment effects on short-term mortality among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 from the European Health Data and Evidence Network (EHDEN) and synthesised these data with randomised evidence.

Randomised evidence was collected through literature search among two published NMAs, COVID-NMA, and clinicaltrials.gov for trials which studied the target treatments in hospitalised COVID-19 patients aged 18 years or older. Results of 21 randomised trials including 15,246 patients were combined through Bayesian network meta-analysis. Non-randomised evidence was collected as a retrospective, multinational comparative cohort study with a new user, active comparator design through EHDEN. Included patients were aged 18 years or over at cohort entry, had at least 365 days of continuous observation time prior to cohort entry, had 0 prior exposures to index treatment in the 365 days prior to index, had at least 1 COVID-19 diagnosis or positive test results in the 30 days prior to or on index, and were hospitalised on index. Although target treatments included aspirin, baricitinib, heparin, remdesivir, and tocilizumab, only evidence for remdesivir and tocilizumab was available. 475 patients from one data partner were included.

This study generated inconclusive evidence for the comparative effectiveness of remdesivir and tocilizumab in reducing short-term mortality among hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Randomised evidence showed no difference between remdesivir and tocilizumab, while non-randomised  evidence showed remdesivir to significantly reduce short-term mortality compared to tocilizumab.

The non-randomised results indicate a need for more streamlined observational data collection pathways, but show that it is feasible to collect non-randomised evidence through EHDEN and that this non-randomised evidence can be compared with randomised evidence. Future studies investigating non-randomised evidence collection may build upon the infrastructure developed for this study at participating hospitals."

But large sections of the country and its political leaders continued to lay claim to these territories. The Social Democratic Party of Germany also continued to be preoccupied with the colonial question. This thesis examines the ideological motives behind the SPD’s decision to embrace the Brussels resolution which was adopted at a congress of the Labour and Socialist International in 1928 that lend legitimacy to German colonial claims. It does so by examining how party-internal discourses were shaped by the periodicals and other publications of five competing party segments (the right, the unions, the centre, the youth wing and the left). It argues against the view that the SPD’s decision was primarily driven by economics and instead suggests that an optimistic assessment of international relations (enabled by a certain theory of imperialism) and a faith in a socialist civilizing mission (made possibly by a sense of European superiority) had a greater effect in swaying the party’s leadership. This thesis further indicates that support for colonial reclamation was limited among Germans socialists. Nevertheless, the SPD executive generally sided with the pro-colonial policies of other European socialist parties. Furthermore, the party was largely unwilling to fundamentally challenge the prevailing apologetic discourse about Germany’s colonial past""""]"

It makes use of multimodal theory as proposed by Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen in Multimodal Discourse (1996). The first part of this thesis contextualizes the case study that is performed in the second part. It does so by providing a theoretical framework, a description of the role of covers in a book’s marketing process, and a historical overview of romance book covers. This is followed by a qualitative case study that analyzes the front covers of the Goodreads Choice Awards’ top 10 romance books of 2011 and 2021. It examines the front cover image, the use of color, and the text—the title and author’s name—through the lenses of discourse, provenance, and ‘thumbnailability’—a concept described in “How Are Book Covers and Their Components Represented in the Digital Market?” by Sophie Darling. It concludes that there are various differences between the covers of romance novels of 2011 and 2021. These changes can be understood to be related to digital advancements—specifically in relation to the growing influence of the internet."

infrastructural processes behind generative AI image models. LAION, a non-profit 
organization which curates datasets for AI training, is chosen as a focal point in the 
analysis. The dispossession of people from their data is framed as an extension of data 
colonialism which is empowered by the platformization of the web. This thesis utilizes 
an infrastructural inversion method, combined with a discourse network analysis to 
argue that a particular form of dispossession is taking place which manifests itself 
most saliently through LAION datasets. The analysis shows that dispossession does 
not take place through one party’s action but through the infrastructural process. By
utilizing image data in an unforeseen manner, for generative AI training, the data has 
gained a new proprietary status. Data is turned into property and by doing so, control 
is taken from its originators. Legal consent to this process is retroactively assumed. In
this process the data is dispossessed in a recursive manner. Because of current legal 
procedures, there is no existing framework to protect people from their data being 
appropriated in this way. Additionally, Big tech companies, non-commercial
organizations, and academic research groups that work with the data are able to 
avoid responsibility for the (copyrighted) content of their datasets. These 
organizations are protected by AI models’ technological constitution which makes it
extremely difficult to track or remove data. Currently, the responsibility to protect 
data lies with the dispossessed. While this dispossession is new in its particularity 
within AI, it is a continuation of the logic of accumulation on which capitalist 
expansion is build. As a whole, this thesis emphasizes the need for decolonial 
alternatives to current digital infrastructures and AI development."
Heidense rituele ruimte,"['Zaal, Jeroen']","['Rakow, Katja']",2023-07-01T01:01:37Z,NL,['Heidendom; Ritueel'],Religie en Samenleving,"In the last few decades an increasing amount of heathen and pagan groups found their place in a more complex religious landscape. Those heathens apply great value to nature and the landscapes around them. Spatial theory tells us space is dynamic, formed by history, borders and thoughts of and use by people. This thesis discusses to what extent space and ritual influence each other and ritual space among heathens in the Netherlands. To find out I use my own in-depth-interviews and several spatial methods. Lefebvre and Saunders provide theories to map the spatial part, as Bell and Van Gennep will do for the ritual part. The interviews with the heathens provide an insight into how they value ritual and the space they live in. This thesis points out that liminality plays a major role in the perceived value of space and ritual. The ritual forms the gate between the profane and the sacred worlds, and some spaces share this quality of liminality. Additionally the degree of liminality is made by multiple factors, some fixed and some variable and as such can be influenced by humans. Space and ritual influence each other directly too. This is because the energies both possess flow into each other by doing the ritual. The ritual increases the energy of the space and vice versa. The value of space given by the people makes what this space really is. Here we see the importance of looking at space as active and dynamic. The value of space is constantly changing, and therefore space itself."

The historical and future effects of Environmental Flow Requirements on hydrologic indicators and water scarcity in the Danube River Basin,"['Hosper, Steven']","['Beek, Rens van']",2023-07-06T00:01:38Z,EN,['PCR-GLOBWB; Environmental Flow Requirements; Water Scarcity; Competition; Drought; Adaptation;'],Earth Surface and Water,"Extreme low-flow conditions have a detrimental effect on aquatic life in freshwater systems. The chance at low-flow conditions is expected to grow as a result of climate change and increased human demand. The European Union is advising its member states to implement Environmental Flow Requirements (EFRs). The Danube, with its great importance and size, is a fitting case study for the implementation of EFRs. This study used the PCR-GLOBWB 2 model, at 5” arcmin scale, to analyse the effectiveness of EFRs based on changes of hydrologic parameters and the impact on water scarcity. This was done for a monthly timeframe to determine the influence of seasonality. Two different EFRs have been studied: the Variable Monthly Flow and the 90th exceedance percentile. The WATCH dataset supplied validated data to study the changes in water scarcity levels and hydrologic parameters as a result of EFR inclusion for the period from 1960 till 2000. Subsequently, the model was forced precipitation and evapotranspiration data from 5 bias-corrected Global Circulation Models, for the RCP 6.0 scenario, in order to study EFR effects on the near (2010-2050) and far (2060-2100) future. The results show an improvement in drought related indicators, namely minimal annual flow and extreme low-flow (Q95), with the implementation of EFRs with the WATCH Forcing Data. This improvement is most distinct in the Hungarian low-lands where without regulations abstractions are responsible for a significant decrease in IHA performance. As water is reserved for the environment, competition over available water resources is enhanced. The EFR definition can have a significant impact on the temporal and spatial distribution of periods of water scarcity.  Model runs based on GCM forcing did not show significant IHA improvement related to EFR inclusion, but water scarcity was is expected to exacerbate with time."

De invloed van het neoliberale hogeronderwijsbeleid op de strategievorming van drie Nederlandse universiteiten","['Beek, Merijn van']","['Haan, I. de']",2023-07-06T00:01:35Z,NL,['Neoliberalisme; Universiteiten; Strategievorming; Vastgoedbeleid; Stakeholders: Onderwijsaanbod'],Geschiedenis van Politiek en Maatschappij,"Sinds de jaren ‘80 hebben er op Nederlandse universiteiten grote hervormingen plaatsgevonden. Zo heeft de opkomst van het neoliberalisme en het daaruit voortkomende new public management geleid tot een overheid die zich beperkte tot haar kerntaken. Voor universiteiten betekende dit enerzijds een groter takenpakket en anderzijds meer autonomie. Om deze taken zo goed mogelijk uit te voeren, richtten universiteiten zich dikwijls tot de markt. Hoewel deze hervormingen voortkomen uit landelijk onderwijsbeleid, hebben deze op de Nederlandse universiteiten een verschillende uitwerking gehad. Daarom richt dit onderzoek zich op de hervormingen op drie verschillende Nederlandse universiteiten, namelijk de Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam, de Universiteit van Amsterdam en de Universiteit Utrecht. Specifiek wordt onderzocht hoe universiteiten hebben gereageerd op de neoliberale hervormingen van het landelijk hogeronderwijsbeleid. 
 	Om tot een antwoord te komen is er gekeken naar de strategieën van deze universiteiten ten aanzien van drie neoliberale parameters, namelijk de rol van externe stakeholders, de aanpassing van het studieaanbod en het vastgoedbeleid. Uit deze vergelijkende historische analyse blijkt dat er geen uniforme reactie was van de universiteiten op de hervormingen en dat zij verschillende strategieën hebben gehanteerd. Ook kan er geconcludeerd worden dat de rol van externe stakeholders, de aanpassing van het studieaanbod en de invloed van het vastgoedbeleid op deze universiteiten zijn vergroot. Daarnaast heeft dit onderzoek zich gericht op het verklaren van de verschillende strategieën van deze universiteiten. De primaire verklaring is dat de universiteiten een verschillende uitgangspositie hadden ten tijde van de neoliberale hervormingen. Zo blijkt dat het verschil in omvang van de universiteiten een effect had op hun positie in de markt. Verder toont dit onderzoek aan dat universiteiten ook zelf actief hebben gestuurd op neoliberale hervormingen en dat deze niet alleen het gevolg zijn van landelijke hervormingen."

On attaining Dworkinian Equality of Opportunity in Medschool selection: Roemer’s model for quantifying inequality,"['Samlal, Djenghiz']","['White, Lucie']",2023-07-06T01:00:44Z,EN,['Medical School; Higher Education; Selection; Equality of Opportunity; Contextualized Admission; John Roemer; Ronald Dworkin'],Applied Ethics,"[""""In the Netherlands, medschool selection was previously regulated via a lottery. Since the introduction of ‘active’ decentralised selection, a decreased diversity is seen amongst medstudents. Recently, the Dutch house of representatives (re-)allowed lottery to be part of the selection process to increase equality of opportunity (EOpp). This thesis argues that admittance to medschool should be regulated by equality of opportunity; in order to do so, contextualised admission based on types should take place, ranking students on their percentile ‘effort’ instead of on their selection score. It does so by using Ronald Dworkin's egalitarianism to define EOpp and applies John Roemer's model to differentiate between someone's native ability and the development thereof that happens due to their brute luck circumstances in a quantifiable manner.""""]"

In het eerste hoofdstuk wordt de relatie tussen seksualiteit, de kunstgeschiedenis en het onderwijs onderzocht. Hiervoor worden theorieën van Ine van Weesebeeck, Louisa Allen, Kathleen Quinlivan en Margreet de Looze en Jenneke van Ditzhuijzen vergeleken om tot een begrip van seksualiteit en seksuele vorming te komen. Amelia Jones’ analyse van seksualiteit in de hedendaagse kunst wordt gekoppeld aan theorieën van Rachel Middleman en Edward Lucie-Smith om aan te tonen welke thema’s onder ‘seksualiteit’ vallen in de kunst. Vervolgens wordt uiteengezet hoe seksuele vorming momenteel in het onderwijs is geregeld en wat de wensen van jongeren hierin zijn. De theorie van Fisher, Grove en Langlands over het gebruik van historische objecten wordt geanalyseerd. In het tweede hoofdstuk wordt deze theorie toegepast op drie casestudies van hedendaagse kunstenaars: Small Crack (2021) van Jenna Gribbon, The Cock (2002) van Wolfgang Tillmans en When The Body Says Yes (2022) van melanie bonajo. Tevens wordt beargumenteerd hoe seksualiteit terugkomt in meer kunstwerken dan deze drie casestudies. Tot slot wordt in het derde hoofdstuk gekeken hoe seksuele vorming aansluit bij de vorming van de leerling aan de hand van Gert Biesta’s theorie over persoonsvorming en Gerard van Stralen’s ideeën over burgerschap. Ook wordt er onderzocht hoe seksuele vorming binnen het CKV-curriculum past en welke handvatten docenten nodig hebben. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat de seksuele vorming in Nederland niet voldoet aan de wensen van de jongeren. De Hedendaagse kunst kan binnen CKV in het kunstonderwijs een bijdrage leveren door het inzetten van de distancing technique van Fisher, Grove en Langlands. Zo draagt kunstonderwijs ook bij aan de vorming en seksuele vorming van de leerling.

Optimal decarbonization of ammonia production in the Netherlands: MILP-based Modeling and Analysis of a Multi-Energy System,"['Makrakis, Charidimos']","['Gazzani, Matteo']",2023-07-18T00:01:09Z,EN,['ammonia; hydrogen; decarbonization; MILP; SMR; eSMR; CCSU; EnergyHub; model; optimal; multi energy system; Netherlands;'],Energy Science,"This study investigates the decarbonization of ammonia production in the Netherlands,
which currently accounts for roughly a quarter of the country’s chemical sector emissions.
The primary objective is to determine the most cost-effective production route for decar-
bonizing the Dutch ammonia industry while taking into account site limitations.
The study begins with a comprehensive literature review, providing an overview of vari-
ous production technologies for ammonia. Among the alternatives considered, conventional
steam methane reforming (SMR) with carbon capture and storage (CCUS), electrified SMR
(eSMR) with CCUS and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers emerge as the
most promising low-carbon routes for ammonia production.
To evaluate the viability of these processes, the study collects and standardizes techno-
economic data, including information on auxiliary systems. A multi-energy systems (MES)
approach combined with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization is em-
ployed to analyze ammonia production at two specific sites: Sluiskil and Chemelot.
The research explores four distinct cases to assess the feasibility, capacity, and associated
costs of the alternative routes for decarbonizing ammonia production. The first two cases
assume unlimited availability of current grid electricity and an imaginary future low-carbon
grid electricity, respectively. The third case incorporates the impact of renewable energy re-
sources (RES), such as offshore wind (OSW) and solar photovoltaic (PV), while considering
limitations in grid electricity imports. The fourth case further incorporates the expansion of
electricity networks to examine how the geographical location of ammonia production sites
affects decarbonization efforts.
The findings indicate that SMR-based ammonia with CCUS can potentially eliminate
up to 84% of current emissions. However, achieving further reductions relies on reducing
the carbon intensity of the Dutch electricity grid. Further decarbonization of ammonia
production becomes feasible through eSMR-based and PEM-based production, but it requires
substantial amounts of OSW, PV, hydrogen storage (HOS), and electric battery storage (BAT).
Moreover, the study highlights the influence of electricity networks on ammonia production
and reveals that the Sluiskil site holds a substantial comparative advantage over the Chemelot
site in terms of costs.
The average cost of ammonia in the Netherlands for an 84% reduction in emissions is
estimated at 300 C/tonNH3 , with an average abatement cost of 32.4 C/tonCO2 . For complete
emission reductions, the cost rises to 1671 C/tonNH3 and 858 C/tonCO2 . Notably, the data
underscore the challenges associated with decarbonizing the final 1% of emissions due to
the limited availability of renewable energy resources during specific periods of the year.
An 88% increase in ammonia price and a corresponding 123% increase in abatement costs
would be necessary.
The study acknowledges several limitations that future research should address. These
include the exclusion of dynamics related to ammonia storage, insufficient consideration of
flexibility parameters for certain technologies, reliance on eSMR with a low technological
readiness level (TRL), absence of a conventional plant with a high carbon capture rate,
assumption of unlimited available area for technology deployment, disregard for excess
electricity and heat sales and assumption of constant gas prices, among others.
In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the decarbonization of ammonia
production in the Netherlands. It emphasizes the need for policy interventions such as the
development of CO2 transport and offshore storage, funding for eSMR research and support
for renewable electricity to facilitate a sustainable and low-carbon ammonia industry."
The protein transition and sustainable diets: a case study on the diets of young adults in Utrecht,"['Hoeven, Laura van der']","['Dermody, Brian']",2023-07-18T00:01:02Z,EN,"['emissions, land use, water use, dietary habits, young adults, social information, non-social information, motives, values, strategies, protein transition, plantbased food, plant-based diets']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"System transitions are needed to create a more sustainable world that provides for future generations. When it comes to dietary choices, a protein transition from animal-based proteins to plant-based proteins in the diets of young adults can facilitate more sustainable diets for the betterment of human health and the environment. To find current patterns and study a smaller subsystem that is under researched to add on to this system change away from the meat and dairy regime towards more plant-based diets: The dietary habits of 25 young adults in Utrecht are studied through interviews, with a focus on the role of social and non-social information, as well as their own values and motivations in determining current diets, in order to find strategies to increase a dietary protein transition and provide insight into more plant-based diets.
Diet labels are not well defined for flexitarians and vegetarians, and vegan diets can be challenging in modern society. Power and achievement values and motives are found to be central to these students' wanting to make a change in the current practices. Environmental degradation mitigation and animal welfare play a bigger role in vegetarian and vegan diets than in flexitarian diets, but they are not unimportant to flexitarians. Health plays a role in every diet, and protein is broadly known to be important for an active lifestyle.
It was found that food environments can still reduce the availability of animal product-based foods and promote plant-based foods better through nudging and price differentiation. Young adults have busy schedules and not a lot of money to spend on food items. Social networks of plant-based eating young adults adapt to more sustainable diets when eating together, which makes them influential in a transition towards plant-based protein diets. Life transitions, in which social situations often change, are windows of change for adapting to more plant-based diets. The opportunity for plant-based diets is increasing through an increase in vegetarian or vegan restaurants and the improvement of meat substitutes. The latter can be further improved by changing intent and making less processed substitutes that are affordable and easily available. Designing more plant-based applications in restaurants, supermarkets or at events. Thereby, a decreasing demand for meat by consumers can shape food environments and social situations towards more sustainable diets that are culturally accepted, healthy, and alleviate climate change."
Energy Justice in South Africa - Visions for a green hydrogen contribution in the Just Energy Transition,"['Vonk, Derek']","['Bayrak, Mucahid']",2023-07-18T00:01:04Z,EN,['Energy justice; just transition; green hydrogen; hydrogen; inequality; energy governance'],Sustainable Development,"The triple challenge of inequality, poverty, and unemployment in South Africa, together with the ever increasing threats from a changing climate, have led to the introduction of a Just Energy Transition (JET). Included in plans for this transition is the introduction of green hydrogen, an energy carrier stated to provide renewable energy, jobs, and justice, adding to an all-encompassing solution to the prevailing challenges. In similarity to the JET, this study applies an energy justice framework to evaluate various actors’ perspectives on the emerging green hydrogen economy in South Africa. Consisting of distributive, recognition, and procedural elements, the framework allows for a holistic analysis of energy systems based on the environmental justice approach. By interviewing participants within the government, private sector, and civil society, the study found a variety of perspectives regarding socioeconomic aspects of the future energy system. From the findings a private and public energy approach were distinguished. The government is opting for privatization of the energy system in order to overcome the failing energy system and acquire national and international private funding for setting up the future energy system, including hydrogen. Simultaneously, a public pathway is presented as an alternative, aiming to bring back energy as a public good, for the betterment of the population, rather than transnational profits. Based on the findings, green hydrogen is generally regarded to be an inevitable future development, leaving little room for negotiating by concerned parties, let alone informing uninvolved actors. Politicizing hydrogen discourse can help inform and include actors, by alerting of the imminent transition they are faced with. This study advises fairer distributing, specifically of international benefits and burdens, while recognizing local requirements through multiscalar governance procedures. Only in such a way can the South African energy system contribute to the global effort of fighting climate change and can governance at the international level contribute to local prosperity."
"The Capabilities Sprint Workshop:
Developing a tool to help value chain actors identify and improve capabilities that enable a smoother transition towards a more sustainable and circular business model.","['Seydoux, Justin']","['Hegger, Dries']",2023-07-18T00:00:50Z,EN,"['Sustainability, Circular economy, Circular business models, Value chain transition, Design thinking, Sprint workshop']",Sustainable Development,"The Circular Economy is seen by many governments and businesses as key to promoting sustainability. Value chains are also integral to the success of the Circular Economy transition. While there are tools that businesses can use to strategize their approach towards a circular business model, there is a gap in tools that address transitioning itself for value chain actors. Therefore, this thesis’s main research aim was to propose how value chains can improve their ability to collectively transitions towards a more sustainable and circular configuration by developing and validating a tool prototype. To achieve this, first, a brief non-systematic literature review of impact assessment, followed by a brief structured literature review on conditions for transitioning, was executed. This was done to identify relevant inputs for the tool. Then, tool development was driven through feedback sessions with TNO employees. Lastly, the final tool prototype was evaluated in a final feedback round with TNO employees. As a result, the thesis identified the concept of dynamic capabilities as useful in categorizing conditions that actors can directly influence and improve, potentially bettering their transition. Furthermore, sustainability could practically be implemented by integrating it into capabilities and the tool structure, rather than having an impact assessment integrated into the tool. The concept of design thinking and a sprint workshop format was effective in orienting tool development towards value chain collaboration. The final tool prototype – the Capabilities Sprint Worksop – was judged by TNO employees to be a potentially useful tool: If the Capabilities Workshop would connect capabilities to business model impacts, definitely position itself as ideational, evaluative or both, and test its assumption in a practical setting, it could be potentially a useful tool. The author judged these caveats, given sufficient time, as resolvable. Overall, the thesis identifies suitable inputs, orientation, structure, and future developments for a tool aimed at helping value chain actors in transitioning towards a more sustainable and circular configuration. Therefore, the tool proposed contributes towards the field of circular business model innovation and circular value chain transitioning."

Dealing With Salinization in The Netherlands - A Good Governance Case?,"['Kats, Ceylan']","['Dieperink, Carel']",2023-07-18T00:01:00Z,EN,['Governance; Salinization; Drought; Water Management; Freshwater management'],Sustainable Development,"Climate change is putting pressure on freshwater systems across the globe due to increased prevalence of more intense droughts, more extreme weather events and a rising sea-level. As such, governance of water-related systems gets increasingly more attention from scientists. During recent years, the Dutch water system has been put under pressure even more by salinization and droughts. This is directly linked to climate change and freshwater supply. Future scenarios tell that this problem will become more problematic in the future. Recent research on salinization and governance has not yet addressed the two topics combined, which indicated that there is a knowledge gap. As such, this research aimed to provide insights in characteristics of good salinization governance, provide an evaluation of the current Dutch salinization governance, and deliver a set of recommendations for addressing bottlenecks within the current salinization governance system.
To find out whether the governance system of salinization could be considered good, an analytical framework, based on a conceptual framework adopted from Bennett and Satterfield (2018), was constructed for the assessment of the effectiveness, the equitability, the responsiveness, and the robustness of the governance system. During the research various freshwater- and salinization-related policy documents have been analyzed. In addition, a series of in-depth interviews with key stakeholders from the governance system have been conducted. The data, with corresponding scores on various governance objectives and characteristics, gave insights on which objectives of governance are scoring poorly, and which are evaluated as good.
The results showed that policy documents and stakeholder opinions did not align. Following from the results, this research concluded that the implementation of policy is being hold back and that effective and responsive action is not following timely. Most of the participants did especially have critique on the direction, capacity, efficiency, and fairness of the system. As such, there is a need for better implementation of the policy to improve the performance of the system The context- rich stakeholder interviews indicated that there are bottlenecks within the science-policy interface, politicization of freshwater governance and that there is a too flexible approach to freshwater management. This research provided a recommendation for each of these bottlenecks, in order to improve the governance system in the future. Due to some limitations of the research, future research on each of the bottlenecks could provide valuable insights on how to improve the governance system for more effective and timely action."
Unpacking the Influence of Viral Infections on Diabetes Mellitus: Understanding Mechanisms and Intervention Implications,"['Afshar, Ari']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-07-15T01:01:15Z,EN,['Diabetes mellites; Viral infections; Pathogenesis'],Epidemiology,"This grant proposal aims to elucidate mechanisms behind existing risk factors for diabetes mellitus, specifically viral infections. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality and continues to rise, becoming an increasingly important global health issue. Diabetes is categorized into two different types: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that is often diagnosed early in life and is characterized by the complete destruction of ß-cells produced in the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes typically develops later in life and occurs due to both decreased insulin production and insulin resistance. Both types share the quality of not being able to sufficiently metabolize circulating blood glucose, resulting in hyperglycemia. 
	Despite current knowledge and evidence showing an association between viral infections and diabetes onset, the specific pathogenesis is still unknown. The primary objective of this study is to understand the mechanisms behind how viral infections impact the onset or progression of diabetes mellitus. Specifically, we will explore if viral infections accelerate the onset of diabetes, if it causes an increased progression of the disease, and if common antiviral treatments may work to delay progression of the disease.
To achieve these objectives, we propose using a mouse model to directly compare how introduction of a viral infection alters the disease trajectory. This study will characterize the complicated relationship between viral infections and diabetes mellitus, leading to new therapeutic approaches and public health strategies."

Landelijk is het percentage jongeren met problematische schulden in de laatste jaren verdubbeld. Daarbij is het uitvalspercentage onder jongere cliënten in Amsterdam-Zuidoost zorgwekkend hoog. DOEL: Dit onderzoek heeft als doel zowel het in kaart brengen welke factoren een effect hebben op uitval onder jongere schuldhulpcliënten in Amsterdam-Zuidoost, als inzicht bieden in de mechanismen die hierachter schuilgaan. THEORIE: Nog weinig literatuur betreft uitval in de schuldhulpverlening of onderzoeken naar jongeren als specifieke cliëntgroep. Bredere literatuur over de oorzaak van schulden en problemen in de schuldhulpverlening als de schaarstetheorie, mechanismen rondom generatiearmoede en de ‘self-determination’ theorie zijn gebruikt en laten een tweedeling zien tussen individuele (gedrags)factoren enerzijds en omgevingsfactoren en sociale structuren anderzijds. METHODE: Middels een kwantitatieve data-analyse van dossierdata is gekeken naar welke factoren de kans op uitval voor jongere cliënten vergroten. Met behulp van kwalitatieve interviews met schuldhulpverleners in Amsterdam-Zuidoost is ingezoomd op de mechanismen achter het uitvallen van jongere schuldhulpcliënten en hun specifieke behoeften. RESULTATEN: Een langere wachttijd tussen aanmelding en afspraak en een lage algemene zelfredzaamheid vergroten de kans dat jongere cliënten uitvallen. Bij jongere schuldhulpcliënten is onder meer sprake van lage financiële vaardigheden, minder eigen verantwoordelijkheid, complexe problematiek in de sociale omgeving en schaamte die het schuldhulptraject belemmeren. CONCLUSIE EN IMPLICATIES: Dit onderzoek laat zien dat niet zozeer sprake is van een tweedeling: schulden en het niet afronden van het schuldhulptraject door jongeren worden veroorzaakt door een samenspel tussen individuele gedragsfactoren (voortkomend uit schaarste en individuele behoeften) en omgevingsfactoren (mechanismen rondom generatiearmoede). Dit onderzoek benadrukt het belang van een speciale aanpak voor jongere (schuldhulp)cliënten, oog voor sociale context en lokale problematiek en een holistische kijk op schulden en schuldhulpverlening."

Bovendien sluiten diagnoses en gekoppelde behandelingen vanwege hun ingewikkelde problematiek vaak slecht bij hen aan. 
In dit onderzoek wordt aan de hand van een thematische analyse en close reading bekeken hoe mensen met een EPA, die hun verhaal gedeeld hebben met de Verhalenbank Psychiatrie, hun diagnose en behandeling ervaren hebben. 
Het bleek dat zij vaker over negatieve dan positieve effecten van het krijgen van een diagnose spraken, het vaker oneens waren met hun diagnose dan eens en dat met name medicijnbehandelingen niet aansloegen of zelfs averechts werkten. Deze groep mensen heeft een diagnose nodig om behandeld te worden, maar het krijgen van een diagnose heeft naast positieve effecten ook veel impact. De daaropvolgende behandeling lijkt ook niet altijd te werken, of zelfs negatief uit te pakken. Dit is niet alleen vervelend voor mensen met een EPA, maar is ook een inefficiënte verdeling van de schaarse middelen van de GGZ. Er is kritische reflectie nodig op het systeem van diagnose-gericht behandelen van EPA’s, omdat het dus niet zonder complicaties lijkt te zijn."

and the impact of taxes. By utilizing stochastic control, we explore how various factors,
such as risk preferences, tax regulations, and emission considerations, influence the optimal
investment and consumption policies. To solve this complex problem, the BCOS method is
employed to numerically tackle the fully coupled Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential
Equations (FBSDEs) arising from the control problem. The BCOS method, known for its
effectiveness in solving coupled FBSDEs, is applied to tackle the complexity of the problem.
This numerical approach enables the exploration of different control parameters, allowing

For a given dimension g, each isogeny class has a distinguished characteristic polynomial, which is a q-Weil polynomial of degree 2g satisfying certain conditions regarding its factorisation over the p-adic integers Z_p. A q-Weil polynomial is a polynomial with integer coefficients such that all of its roots have absolute value sqrt(q). Enumerating all isogeny classes is a two-steps procedure. The first step is determining all q-Weil polynomials of degree 2g and the second step is determining the conditions for which a given q-Weil polynomial is the characteristic polynomial of some abelian variety over F_q. This process has been carried out for a fixed dimension up to g = 5 in recent articles by various authors. However, a few of these results contained some mistakes, particularly in the first step for dimensions 3, 4 and 5. This thesis contains a correction of these specific results and also explains the second step for these dimensions."

For example, I proved that every graph G on n vertices has a subdeck of [n/2]+2 cards from which we can determine the number of edges of G.

Wendy Myrvold [Ars Combinatoria, 1989] showed that a disconnected graph and a connected graph both on n vertices have at most [n/2]+1 cards in common. Moreover, she found infinite families of trees and disconnected forests for which this upper bound is attained. Hence, we need at least [n/2]+2 cards to determine whether a graph is a tree.  Bowler, Brown, and Fenner [Journal of Graph Theory, 2010] conjectured that this bound is tight. In this thesis, I prove this conjecture for sufficiently large n: I show that a tree T and a unicyclic graph G on n vertices have at most [n/2]+1 common cards. 

Based on this theorem, I show that any forest and non-forest also have at most [n/2]+1 common cards. Moreover, I have classified all pairs (except finitely many) for which this bound is strict. Furthermore, I adapted the main ideas of the proof for trees to show that the girth of a graph on $n$ vertices can be determined based on any 2n/3+1 of its cards. Lastly, I showed that any 5n/6+2 cards determine whether a graph is bipartite."
Analyzing and improving the quality of Voronoi Hausdorff morphing using component reduction,"['Simons, Arjen']","['Kreveld, Marc van']",2023-07-22T00:01:24Z,EN,['morphing; Shape interpolation; Hausdorff distance; Voronoi morph'],Game and Media Technology,"This thesis introduces a new quantitative metric, used to determine the quality
of a morph. This metric is based on the angular change of all enclosed boundary
loops and is experimentally shown to effectively distinguish between morphs that are
visually appealing and morphs that are worse in terms of visual quality. This thesis
also improves the Voronoi and mixed morphs [15] using two approaches. The first
approach experimentally shows that a dynamic variable for the mixed morph can
result in morphs that better balance all quantitative metrics and results in visually
more appealing morphs. The second approach is the introduction of a new abstract
morph and its mixed variant, that adjust the Voronoi morph to reduce the number of
components present in intermediate shapes. We prove some basic properties on the
creation of components in the Voronoi morph and that the new morph also adheres
to the Hausdorff property [16]. In an experimental analysis of the new morphs, we
record data on the area, perimeter and total angular change development throughout
the morph, and the number of holes and components. We show that one of the new
morphs performs best on our quantitative analysis and also visually appears most
attractive."
Finding Generalized Cohomologies from Supersymmetric Field Theories,"['Jansen, Bouke']","['Meier, F.L.M.']",2023-07-22T00:01:18Z,EN,"['Algebraic Topology; Field Theory; String Theory, Cohomology; Supersymmetry; Stacks; Witten Genus; Bordisms; Modular Forms']",Mathematical Sciences,"Generalized Cohomology is a topic in Algebraic Topology.

We will build bridges between these topics. We will introduce supermanifolds and stacks. Using those, we will define suitable bordism categories on which we define Supersymmetric Field Theories. We will see that the Field Theories are a geometric construction of some Generalized Cohomology Theories. We will construct ordinary cohomology from 0|1-dimensional Field Theories and complexified K-theory and complexified tmf from 1|1 and 2|1-dimensional Field Theories respectively. In these constructions, we aim to keep the dimensions general. In particular, we are able to relate even dimensional Field Theories to Siegel Modular forms."

"Model performance of a conceptual hydrological 
model over the Nile Basin:
effect of parameter uncertainty on the performance of PCR-GLOBWB 2","['Haar, Erwin van der']","['Beek, Rens van']",2023-07-27T00:01:10Z,EN,[],Earth Surface and Water,"The Nile River is the major river basin in the northeast of Africa with an ever-growing population 
dependent on it for its water needs. These needs are only expected to grow in future. Predicting Nile 
discharge is hard as discharge of the river itself can vary a lot from year to year. Furthermore, Global 
Hydrological Models, such as PCR-GLOBWB2, also struggle to accurately predict Nile flows and tend 
to overestimate discharge, most likely due to poor data availability. The Nile River itself can be 
divided into several basins, with the Blue Nile being the most important in terms of discharge, with 
60-70 % of discharge originating here, but this comes mostly in the summer months. The rest of the 
year the White Nile, a much larger basin with its origins in the region around Lake Victoria, is the 
main source of water. 
To improve model performance of the PCR-GLOBWB 2 it was chosen to improve input data and 
parameterization. By using updated data soil data (SoilGrids), topographic data (MERIT-DEM) and 
meteorological data (WFDE5) and using an updated river routing method. The results were validated 
by GRDC data, but as these are limited, both spatially and temporally it was chosen to seek an 
additional way of validating data. In this case GLEAM was used to validate evaporation of the model. 
Combining of both validation methods was used to better understand the discrepancies in model 
performance for the Nile Basin.
Results still showed poor results for the run without any improvement as expected. It showed that 
the White Nile performance was very poor, owing to an underestimation of evaporation, mainly in 
the months of no precipitation. This was observed in some other basin as well. The Blue Nile
performance was better but still has overestimations of discharge, especially in the drier months. 
Validation of the results with GLEAM showed good options to close the water balance and get better 
temporal and spatial data despite some of its current limitations.
Introducing new datasets and new parameterization did not improve model results as expected and 
the poor datasets were not the main cause of the poor performance. The same regions which 
performed poorly for the standard run also performed poorly for the other runs, indicating an 
underlying problem. This has to do with the evaporation in the model, especially in the Sudd 
swamps, where flooding does not occur as expected leading to larger discharge and decreased water 
storage. Here it was identified that missing model descriptions is a large problem and that this 
process needs to be better described. For future, many improvements can be made to model and by 
this, combined with better validation methods, the description of PCR-GLOBWB 2 of the hydrology 
of the Nile River could be improved."
When Loving Yourself Becomes an Addiction: A Study About the Relationship Between Adolescent Narcissism and Social Media Addiction,"['Clerck, Britt de']","['Ouvrein, Gaëlle']",2023-07-27T00:01:24Z,EN,"['social media addiction, adolescent narcissism, attention-seeking, selfesteem']",Youth Studies,"Social media is very popular among adolescents. Yet, the use of social media has a downside. 
Some adolescents find themselves addicted to social media. To reduce the risk of social

this cross-sectional study was to investigate whether there is a relationship between
adolescent narcissism and social media addiction. Furthermore, this study tested whether
attention-seeking explains the relationship between adolescent narcissism and social media 
addiction. Lastly, it tested if self-esteem impacts the relationship between adolescent 
narcissism and social media addiction. Data from the Digital Youth Project was used to 
perform a hierarchical regression analysis on a sample of 2443 adolescents. Results showed a 
significant relationship between adolescent narcissism and social media addiction, this 
relationship is partially explained by attention-seeking. Self-esteem was not found to have an 
impact on the relationship between adolescent narcissism and social media addiction. An 
important limitation to consider is that this study is cross-sectional. In order to make 
statements about the directions of the effects, a longitudinal study needs to be conducted.

"Socioeconomic position, life events, and sports participation: a moderation analysis of transitioning to the labor market, getting married or entering a new relationship, becoming a parent, and retiring","['Slob, Jesper']","['Kamphuis, Carlijn']",2023-07-27T00:01:27Z,EN,[],Social Policy and Public Health,"Physical activity (PA) is an important determinant of health, yet many people do not meet the PA recommendations of the World Health Organization. In addition, there are socioeconomic differences in PA and sports participation, with lower SEP groups showing lower levels of participation compared to their higher counterparts. While life events have been suggested as factors affecting PA and sports participation, their effect on the relationship between SEP and sports participation specifically remains understudied. This study aimed to resolve this gap by examining the effect of four life events on sports participation and the relationship between SEP and sports participation. Data from participants (15 – 79 years) of the 2018 Dutch NSO study (N = 2351) were used to analyze the moderating role of transitioning to the labor market, getting married or entering a new relationship, becoming a parent, and retiring on the relationship between SEP and sports participation. The findings reveal no moderation effects for life events on the relationship between SEP and sports participation, except for getting married or entering a relationship. In addition, this study found a positive effect of SEP and retiring on doing any sports, and negative effects of getting married or entering a relationship and becoming parents on sports frequency. These results stress the importance of interventions aimed at low SEP groups, and individuals who recently became parents, married or entered a new relationship. Future studies could focus on the effects of other life events on the sports participation of Dutch adults."

The dominant literature views FGCS from a deficit-based approach and perpetuates that the parents of FGCS are a barrier that FGCS must overcome, contradicting the fact that all students report parental and family support as important resources. Research Questions: This study therefore examines how FGCS experience parental and family support and how that relates to their perceptions and experiences of cultural mismatching as university students. Sub-questions further examine the importance of identity and parenting styles in relation to such experiences. Methods: Data was collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 13 FGCS enrolled at a Dutch research university during the 2022-2023 academic year. Results: All FGCS perceived parental and family support as a beneficial resource, though not all participants received such support. FGCS who reported low parental support and involvement, i.e, the accomplishment of natural growth, described using their self-motivation and discipline to persist and navigate struggles to acclimate to the university culture. Those who reported frequent parental support and involvement, i.e., concerted cultivation, used those instances to cope with setbacks and feelings of cultural mismatching. Conclusion: This research demonstrates that parental and family support is an instrumental resource for FGCS and that continued emotional support from parents helps to mitigate the cultural mismatching experienced by FGCS."

This is accomplished through the analyses of relationships between partner (non-)disclosure, social support, and conflict, and negative post-abortion emotions and decision satisfaction. Furthermore, the mediating effect of decision satisfaction is tested and reasons for non-disclosure to the man involved in the pregnancy are analyzed. The study uses cross-sectional data from the Dutch Abortion and Mental Health Study (DAMHS), collected through structured face-to-face interviews. The sample used for the main analyses includes 265 Dutch-speaking women who were pregnant from their partner and underwent self-chosen abortion. To analyze the data we used One-Way ANOVA, linear regression analyses, frequency analysis and PROCESS. Significant relationships were identified between conflict with the partner and negative post-abortion emotions, as well as between decision satisfaction and negative post-abortion emotions. No significant associations were observed for social support, decision satisfaction, and (non-)disclosure. Furthermore, the analysis showed that reasons for non-disclosure predominantly stemmed from feelings of stigma. The findings of this research contribute to our understanding of the role played by partners in shaping post-abortion emotions and decision satisfaction. The gained insights can inform future research and the development of interventions aimed at providing better support for women going through an abortion process."
"Moroccan immigrants’ overrepresentation in property-related crime in the Netherlands:
an explanation by social bond theory","['Huijers, Marijn Sterre']","['Besamusca, Janna']",2023-07-27T00:01:19Z,EN,[],Social Policy and Public Health,"In the Netherlands, Moroccan immigrant youth are being overrepresented as suspects of property crime compared to native Dutch youth. By studying the protective factors that prevents this group from committing property crimes, policymakers and researchers can develop more effective strategies that promote social cohesion and integration. In this study the social bond theory was used as a framework to study to what extent property crime self-reported by Moroccan immigrant youth in the Netherlands can be explained by social bonds. In this study (N = 1139) the NELLS-dataset was used to study the likelihood of stealing for Moroccan immigrant youth compared to native Dutch youth mediated by attachment to parents, attachment to friends, attachment to school/work and commitment to conventional values. The binary logistic regression showed that Moroccan immigrant youth were significantly more likely to steal when controlling for individual factors. They were also more attached to their friends and conventional values, but this didn’t influence the likelihood of stealing. The results support that Moroccan immigrant youth do have different social bonds compared to native Dutch, but this did not explain their overrepresentation in property crime. This shows the importance of not only measuring the strength of the social bond but also the kind of bond."

The goal of this study was to understand whether teacher, peer and parental support function as a buffer against the negative effects of racial marginalization on mental health of adolescents with a non-Dutch background. A representative sample of adolescents was used in this study, utilizing cross-sectional data. A multiple regression analysis was conducted specifically on adolescents with a non-Dutch background (N = 1507). The results showed that racial marginalization has a significant negative effect on mental health. Parental support was found to function as a significant protective factor against this effect, while teacher support was found to enforce the negative effect of racial marginalization on mental health problems. Peer support was found to be non-significant. It is important to delve deeper into the role of parents and to consider the role teachers play in racial marginalization and mental health problems more. More knowledge about racial marginalization could lead to a reduction of it and its unwanted effect on adolescent mental health."
"The uncertain future of the La Valette landslide:
Reconstructing the historical lifecycle
between 1982 and 2000
and the future impact of the La Valette landslide","['Berenschot, Tim']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-07-28T01:02:09Z,EN,['La Valette; Valette; Landslide; photogrammetry; historical photogrammetry; point cloud; risk zonation; historical life cycle'],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"Landslides have an impact on inhabitants, properties and economic activities, depending on a variety
of movement types and velocities. Therefore, a management approach is required to assess the
possible risks of an area. The mountainous region of the Alps is susceptible to landslides for example,
as geophysical properties and meteorological characteristics destabilize the slope. In 1982, a
landslide was triggered in these mountains above the Barcelonnette and Saint-pons municipalities
called the La Valette. This landslide shows a rotational slide in the upper parts and earth and mud
flows in the middle to lower parts. These flows have regularly endangered the residential areas
downhill, with the largest flow having a volume of 50.000 m3. 

Although these flows have not reached the downhill valley yet, through morphological developments and climate change the intensity and frequency of the flows might increase. Therefore, the goal of this research was to assess the future
societal impact of the La Valette by defining these morphological and climate changes.
To research the morphological developments, historical photogrammetry was used, as
quantifications can be derived from historical aerial images for timestamps where little to no
research was done. For the La Valette landslide, historical photogrammetry was not yet used within
the literature. In this research, the semi-global matching algorithm was able to create point clouds
for 1982, 1988, 1990, 1997 and 2000 with totals of approximately 70 million and point densities
between 2 and 4 points per square meter. These point clouds were used to create five DEMS of
differences combined with a 2021 DTM from IGN, resulting in changes like the development and
retrogression of the main scarp, the steepening of the slope and an extension towards the North
West. Furthermore, these clouds were also used to research the vertical displacement through
multiscale model to model cloud comparison, deriving accumulation and displacement locations that
were previously generalized.

To research the climate developments, Meteoblue was used to obtain historical meteorological
precipitation events and the predicted precipitations and temperatures between 2020 and 2100.
Within the historical precipitation events, multiple peaks were present surrounding the failure
events. Furthermore, climate predictions indicate that whilst precipitation sums and heavy rainfall
events remain stable or decrease, the number of heat days and the warm spell indexes will increase.
Considering that snow thaw and the variety of extreme weather events might increase, the intensity
and frequency of the failure events could also increase.

To define the future societal impact, a risk zonation was created using the previously generated
information. By creating the theoretical destructive potential of flows to the valley and the
vulnerability of the elements at risk, a risk zonation was constructed for the study area with five risk
classes. This resulted in residential areas downhill and in the valley to be situated in high to very high
risk classifications. Furthermore, 30.6 percent of the 1317 addresses was situated in the high to very
high classifications and 74.9 in the moderate to very high classifications. To conclude this research, it
can therefore be seen that the societal impact might increase in the future. For future research
however, it is recommended to create a more intensive cooperation with IGN, as this organization
could provide camera information and LIDAR datasets to improve the precision and accuracy of the
data. Furthermore, the historical images could also be digitized with a higher resolutions to improve
the point densities, which created constraints in this research."

This answers the research question of how the model’s results can be compared and configurated with 
current tree configurations. The sensitivity of the Tygron software is tested by adjusting meteorological 
data and answering the research question of the models’ sensitivity by adjusting meteorological data. 
The study finds that trees positively impact thermal comfort by reducing PET through shading, 
evapotranspiration, and blocking solar radiation. The placement of trees also affects their cooling 
ability, with single trees in a line resulting in a lower PET than a pair of two trees planted with an 
interval of two trees, between 0,1-1,4 °C for road and 0,8-1,1°C for sidewalk measurements. The study 
highlights the impact of the shadow effect on PET results, with trees and buildings both affecting the 
PET. The Tygron software has been used to model urban configurations, plant trees, and calculate PET, 
and the study found that the location of measurement points and the height of trees in the model affect 
PET results. Overall, this study contributes to the existing knowledge gaps in research, such as 3D 
modelling and the Tygron software regarding thermal comfort and tree placement, providing valuable 
insights for future urban planning and tree planting strategies to improve thermal comfort in Dutch

Platform Centric Warfare (PCW) principles in warfare. Network Centric Warfare creates its advantage by
gaining a technological, structural and organisational advantage. Because warfare is known to be a complex
system, it is difficult to predict the future status of the battlespace. Therefore, it is relevant to investigate the
concept of NCW to be well prepared when it is put to practice. Essential for simulating this concept of
warfare is the acquisition of knowledge through experience by practicing the NCW principles in real-life
scenarios. Agent Based Modelling (ABM) is one of the ways to simulate these real-life scenario, which will
be the analysis method in this research. Both PCW and NCW are programmed in the ABM software GAMA
to create empirical data about the differences between the PCW and NCW doctrine. These differences are
grounded by literature and expert advice to create the behavioural rule set for every agent and scenario. The
empirical data is acquired from 6 different scenarios that are written as outputs from the simulations. The
indicators for mission success in this research are: (1) mission duration and (2)casualty rate per simulation.
The results of the analysis is that scenario 6: Combination is the most favourable in terms of mission success,
whereas scenario 4: Group-size is the least favourable. There is room for extra and more efficient coding

Methode. In semigestructureerde interviews met adolescenten (n = 6) en ouders (n = 6) is opgroeien en opvoeden in een opwarmend klimaat besproken. Resultaten. Adolescenten ervaren klimaatstress en het merendeel neemt actief deel aan klimaatacties. Bovendien voelen zij een grote mate van verantwoordelijkheid om zich in te zetten tegen klimaatverandering. Hoewel ouders zich zorgen maken over de toekomst van hun kinderen in een opwarmend klimaat, geeft een deel van de ouders aan klimaatverandering niet tot weinig te bespreken met hun kind(eren). Adolescenten geven aan vooral behoefte te hebben aan informatieve gesprekken over klimaatverandering met hun ouders. Conclusie. Deze bevindingen benadrukken het belang van ouderlijke betrokkenheid en communicatie in de context van klimaatverandering. Ouders kunnen hun pedagogische verantwoordelijkheid in een opwarmend klimaat vervullen door open, informatieve gesprekken aan te gaan waarin ze hun kind hoop en perspectief bieden.

They can be constructed from elliptic curves and take values in modular forms. Important examples include the signature for 4n-manifolds and the so-called Â-genus which is related to the Dirac operator. A more general perspective is provided by complex genera which can be studied using formal group laws. This is the right setting for a generalization of elliptic genera to G-manifolds. For this, equivariant bordism and equivariant formal group laws are considered. In physics, elliptic genera arise as partition functions of supersymmetric string theories which has been originally described by Witten. Since then, this perspective has been further considered and gave rise to several developments in the mathematical theory. In this thesis, we will give an introduction to elliptic genera and compare the mathematical and physical perspective. Furthermore, we will explain their relations to formal group laws and outline the generalization of elliptic genera to the equivariant setting."

Currently, the Traffic Controllers of ProRail use their own knowledge to predict the delays of the trains, where they also include the delays of other trains as a factor. ProRail want to research if it is feasible to create a decision support system, where the Traffic Controllers are aided in making predictions about delayed trains and how to intervene to minimize the disruptions. One of the first stepping stones is to create a delay prediction system, and that is what this thesis focuses on. Our goal is the exploration of causal analysis applied to delay data, and this result is included in a delay prediction model. The causal relations between trains are captured in a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Creating the SCM involves two steps: finding the causal graph, and learning the assignment functions. The causal graph is identified by applying background knowledge to the PC-algorithm, which reduces the search space. The assignment functions are learned by training multiple Neural Networks. The result of this thesis is a prediction system that includes causal relations between trains, referred to as possible train interactions,
as input to predict the delays of the trains at its next time tabling point. The model performs similarly to an existing model and shows potential for improvement in further research."

In order to provide some inspiration for different ways of retaining talent, this study is designed to illustrate the positive effects of self-leadership on organizational commitment and to test the mediating role of self-efficacy and job satisfaction. This study’s reasoning is based on previous empirical studies’ findings, the two-factor theory, and Mathieu & Zajac’s antecedent and consequence model of organizational commitment. The hypothesis that self-leadership can increase employees’ organizational commitment by influencing self-efficacy and job satisfaction is proposed in this study. This study used a cross-sectional survey, and the data were gathered from 212 employees. The results showed that job satisfaction mediates the positive relationship between self-leadership and organizational commitment (b=0.06, p<0.05), whereas self-efficacy did not act as a mediator."

Acceleration of Just Local Food Initiatives,"['Besselaar, Lauren']","['Kalfagianni, Agni']",2023-08-10T00:01:40Z,EN,['Localization; Acceleration; Justice; Small-scale Agriculture'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Modern agriculture has become highly industrialized and globalized, leading to unsustainable practices and a disconnect between farmers and consumers. Localization, ensuring that goods and services that can be produced and provided within a local area are produced and provided there, can bridge this disconnect and promote more sustainable practices. 
However, this alternative system remains limited in size compared to the conventional food system. Furthermore, the concern regarding the idealization of these initiatives highlights the need to prioritize justice to establish a more impactful alternative food system. This thesis explores how local food initiatives (LFIs) in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (AMA) pursue justice and analyzes their efforts for acceleration while preserving their fundamental characteristics of being small-scale and locally focused. 

To identify just LFIs, the four most prevalent tenets of justice within environmental justice theory, namely distributive, procedural, recognitional, and restorative justice were utilized, in combination with ecology & non-human beings by Tribaldos & Kortetmäki (2022) and anticipation and reflexivity by Ludwig & Macnaghten (2020). This was combined with the five mechanisms of acceleration of Gorissen et al. (2018) in a novel conceptual framework. This framework highlights the way different types of LFIs pursue justice and acceleration to foster system change. The methodological approach began with extensive desk research on justice for 67 LFIs in the AMA and led to the interviewing of six LFIs on both justice and acceleration. The majority of LFIs in the AMA prioritize justice alongside local and sustainable food production. The findings emphasize the importance of replication and partnering for acceleration, showcasing their impact on communities and other LFIs. The findings also show a misalignment regarding the significance of upscaling for LFIs, as they do not want or prioritize it. Municipalities play a crucial role in supporting LFIs and can enhance this by leveraging the knowledge of embedded LFIs.

This research creates a new perspective on LFIs by incorporating the concept of justice, a social dimension, into existing acceleration literature. Moreover, the methodological approach helps to further define how acceleration works within a just and local scale. It is believed that this approach could be applied in similar regions where LFIs are emerging, to advance the development of the created conceptual framework."

However, there is currently limited evidence for this relationship in western adolescents. It is crucial to expand the literature on this topic to include information about the relationship in adolescents in general. This is important because adolescents typically have lower self-control than adults in specific contexts, especially when the reward system is stimulated. Video games are known to be particularly effective at triggering this reward system. Additionally, studies have found that certain game genres (RPG, shooter, and strategy) have a direct impact on IGD and that adolescents with low self-control are highly susceptible to the mechanisms involved in these games. However, no research has yet been done on the moderating effect of game genres on the relationship between self-control and IGD. Aims: Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the relationship between self-control and IGD among adolescents aged 12 to 18 years in the Netherlands. Additionally, the study examined whether game genre moderated this effect. Method: 236 adolescents (45.3% girls, MAge = 14.27, SDAge = 1.59), ranging from age 12 to 18, participated in this online questionnaire study, part of the longitudinal Digital Family Project by Utrecht University. IGD was measured using the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale, self-control was measured with the Self-control Scale, and game genres were coded using an expanded game genre categorization model. Results: This study found a significant negative relationship between self-control and IGD. In other words, low self-control was related to more IGD-symptoms. The game genres RPG, shooter, and strategy collectively did not moderate the relationship between self-control and IGD. Gender accounted for a significant portion of the explained variance. Furthermore, implications of these findings are explored, as well as explanations for a lack thereof regarding the moderating effect."

A positive parent-child relationship has in addition shown to positively affect children’s self-esteem and serve as a buffer. However, the longitudinal effects of post-divorce parental conflict on adolescents’ self-esteem and the role of the parent-child relationship, have received less attention. Adolescent self-esteem post-divorce is important to examine, because suffering from low self-esteem can have a detrimental impact on one’s life. Aim: The current study investigated the relationship between post-divorce parental conflict and adolescents’ self-esteem, and examined the possible moderating role of parent-child relationship quality. Could the parent-child relationship serve as a buffer for the negative consequences of post-divorce parental conflict on adolescents’ self-esteem. Method: 132 children completed questionnaires to examine the associations between post-divorce parental conflict (CBQ), self-esteem (CBSK-A) and parent-child relationship quality
(CBQ), and to examine parent-child relationship quality as a potential moderator. Two multiple regression analyses were conducted to answer the research questions. Results: Post-divorce parental conflict was positively associated with a relative change in adolescents’ self-esteem. Moreover, parent-child relationship quality was not significantly associated with adolescents’ self-esteem and did not moderate the association between parental conflict and self-esteem. Discussion: The importance of examining the development of children’s self-esteem post-divorce was confirmed by previous research. Further research is needed to assess possible explanations for the unexpected positive association between post-divorce parental conflict and relative change in adolescents’ self-esteem."

Internal attributions, negative discipline, differences in gender.']","Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Background. There is ample evidence that parents react differently to misbehavior of sons and daughters. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms underlying this different treatment. Goal. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between parental internal attributions about disobedient behavior and the negative discipline of children, and whether this association was different for boys and girls. 
Method. Data was retrieved from 241 American parents with a child between the ages of 5 and 7. For this study, participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Parents completed an online survey in Qualtrics. Parents reported their internal attributions and negative discipline in five misbehavior scenarios, where parents had to depicture their own child. 
Results. Results from the regression analysis suggested that parental internal attributions for disobedient behavior of their child is related to more negative discipline by parents when their child is disobedient. In addition, the interaction term was added to see if the relationship between internal parental attributions of disobedient behavior and negative discipline was different for boys and girls. The sex of the child as a moderator did not appear to significantly influence this relationship. 
Conclusion. In sum, internal parental attributions play an important role in negative discipline. Thus, these internal attributions seem to underlie the way parents respond to disobedient behavior by their children. This signals key features to explore different types and underlying emotions to further explain how and why parents describe their child´s disobedient behavior to different causes. One may conclude that it is important to make parents aware of this attribution process to guide more similar treatment of children."

In totaal namen 81 kinderen (43 jongens, 38 meisjes) tussen de leeftijd van 26 en 59 maanden samen met de ouders deel aan het onderzoek. De oudervragenlijst van de Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) werd gebruikt om externaliserend gedrag te meten. Daarnaast werden de Early Sociocognitive Battery (ESB) en de Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) ingezet om gedeelde aandacht, sociale responsiviteit en taalontwikkeling te beoordelen.
Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat gedeelde aandacht, sociale responsiviteit en taalontwikkeling niet significant geassocieerd waren met externaliserend gedrag. Daarentegen had de factor problemen met leeftijdgenoten wel een significante invloed op externaliserend gedrag. Eerdere studies ondersteunen deze bevindingen met betrekking tot problemen met leeftijdgenoten als voorspeller van externaliserend gedrag.
De beperkingen van het onderzoek omvatten het ontbreken van metingen van expressieve taalvaardigheid en de mogelijkheid dat andere factoren een grotere rol spelen bij de voorspelling van externaliserend gedrag. Om meer inzicht in de relatie tussen de variabelen te krijgen, is het aanbevolen dat toekomstig onderzoek gebruikmaakt van longitudinaal onderzoek, waarbij de variabelen over een langere periode worden bekeken."

Trauma-Informed Care (TIC) is an approach that aims to prevent retraumatization, safety and recovery. Professionals take a significant role in providing effective treatment and preventing new trauma. This study aimed to explore the relationship between attitudes towards TIC (independent variable) and TIC-related behavioral interventions (dependent variable) of professionals, and whether this relationship was stronger among those with more or less knowledge of TIC (moderator).Simple regression analysis, multiple regression analysis, and Spearman rank correlation were conducted. The ARTIC and BIQ questionnaires were used in the analyses, which included 156 respondents. The results showed that there was no significant positive relationship between attitudes towards TIC and TIC-related behavioral interventions of professionals. Professionals with more positive attitudes towards TIC did not necessarily perform more TIC-related behavioral interventions than professionals with less positive attitudes. The study also found no significant interaction effect between previous trauma knowledge and attitudes towards TIC in explaining TIC-related behavioral interventions of professionals. However, the study did find a significant difference in attitudes towards TIC between professionals with more and professionals with less knowledge of trauma. This suggests that the more knowledge professionals have about trauma, the more positive their attitudes towards TIC are. Therefore, it is important to provide professionals with adequate knowledge about trauma, as this may improve their attitudes towards TIC. These findings provide insights for professionals and policymakers in the residential care for adolescents and contribute to improving the overall mental health of this population. However, further research is needed to identify other factors that may influence the use of TIC-related behavioral interventions to better support professionals in applying these interventions."

In the development of ToM in young children, concepts that are considered important are shared attention and vocabulary. The aim of this study was to further clarify the underlying mechanisms in young children's ToM development. To achieve this, we examined the relationships between shared attention, vocabulary, and ToM. The central research question was: 'What is the relationship between shared attention and Theory of Mind in Dutch children aged three to five years, and is this relationship mediated by vocabulary?'

A mediation analysis was conducted to answer the research question. No significant relationships were found between shared attention and vocabulary, as well as between shared attention and ToM. However, a significant relationship was observed between vocabulary and ToM. These results have implications for further research on other processes that may be involved in the relationship between vocabulary and ToM, such as the role of executive functions."

Enhancing Dutch Audio Transcription through Integration of Speaker Diarization into the Automatic Speech Recognition model Whisper,"['Mul, Anouk']","['Karnstedt-Hulpus, I.R.']",2023-08-11T00:02:43Z,EN,['speech-to-text; automatic speech recognition; Whisper; speaker diarization; PyAnnote audio; NeMo; Dutch National Police;'],Applied Data Science,"The Dutch National Police faces the challenge of efficiently processing and transcribing a significant amount of audio data collected during investigations. To assist detectives in their work, artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as Whisper, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, are implemented into user-friendly applications. However, Whisper lacks the ability to distinguish between speakers, limiting its application in scenarios involving multiple speakers and overlapping speech. This thesis explores the performance of speaker diarization pipelines
from PyAnnote and NeMo on the VoxConverse and NFI-FRITS datasets. Additionally, experiments are conducted to improve the performance of the pipelines on both datasets by choosing appropriate hyperparameter settings. By incorporating a speaker diarization system alongside Whisper, the aim is to enhance the robustness and comprehensiveness of an existing speech-to-text application. The evaluation reveals promising results, with hyperparameter tuning and domain-specific configurations significantly improving the Diarization Error Rate (DER)
for both datasets. PyAnnote benefits from adjusted segmentation and clustering thresholds, as well as changes in the clustering method. NeMo’s clustering diarizer outperforms the neural diarizer, and domain-specific configurations enhance performance. In general, NeMo demonstrates superior performance on both datasets
in terms of Diarization Error Rate (DER) compared to PyAnnote. However, this improved performance comes at the cost of increased computational requirements in terms of speed and memory usage. By augmenting Whisper with speaker diarization, investigators can efficiently analyze transcribed text ascribed to individual speakers, improving the accuracy and efficiency of audio data analysis. Further research should focus on compiling an enlarged domain-specific dataset with varying numbers of speakers to enable more specific hyperparameter tuning and achieve
better performance results. Additionally, optimizing resource usage for the superior NeMo model would enhance its speed and memory efficiency. Overall, this research contributes to advancing speaker diarization methods alongside the Whisper ASR model. These advancements will lead to more effective speech analysis tools for law enforcement and other fields relying on accurate and comprehensive audio processing.

Improving Pesticide Exposure Estimates using Wind Direction Interpolation Methods,"['Nibbering, Thomas']","['Kesteren, Erik-Jan van']",2023-08-11T00:02:58Z,EN,['pesticide exposure; spatial interpolation; wind direction;'],Applied Data Science,"Pesticides play an important role in modern-day agriculture by protecting produce from pests and diseases. Nonetheless, exposure to these biological agents poses a significant public health concern, highlighting the necessity for exposure assessments. In recent years, spatial simulation models have emerged as an effective approach to estimate the extent and distribution of pesticide drift due to their ability to consider a range of factors, such as wind directions. Here, the typical approach is to derive this type of information from meteorological stations closest to the pesticide application area, introducing considerable inaccuracies. In order to provide a more robust and versatile alternative, this study aimed to examine spatial interpolation methods that may improve pesticide exposure estimates using wind field records from the Netherlands in 2017. In doing so, five spatial interpolation models were adopted to estimate wind directions at unobserved sites, namely naïve interpolation, nearest neighbour, inverse distance weighting, universal kriging and random forest. Performance of these models was evaluated using an out- of-sample circular root-mean-squared error (CRMSE) that was obtained through spatial 𝑘-fold cross validation. A sensitivity analysis examined the influence of varying observations on the performance of each model. Results showed distinct visual patterns that aligned with previous studies. Nonetheless, limited variability in hourly wind field measures resulted in a relatively similar performance across the employed models. All in all, the inverse distance weighting demonstrated the lowest out-of-sample error for interpolating wind directions. This finding suggested that the adoption of this model in pesticide drift simulations provides a more valid representation of wind fields at the application areas compared to the approach often employed. In turn, this may improve the accuracy of pesticide exposure estimates obtained from these simulations."

The research aimed to identify performance differences between the two algorithms and assess their feasibility for practical use by accountants in their daily operations. While both algorithms showed potential, the Random Forest model marginally outperformed XGBoost, but the performance varied depending on the training data used. Despite XGBoost exhibiting a faster model training process, neither model yielded predictions reliable enough for practical use by accountants, with an average error rate of approximately 101.94% of the target variable's average magnitude. The complex nature of company's transactions and the limitations in the dataset used could have contributed to this low performance. This research contributes new insights to the domain of cash flow prediction, highlighting the need for more accurate and reliable machine learning models for this purpose and suggesting a potential path for further research to explore other models and incorporate additional company-related features. However, a more critical aspect to address would be the enhancement of data quality and the identification of clearer patterns within the dataset, as these factors significantly influence the predictive performance. These findings can guide future investigations and efforts in not only improving cash flow predictions for SME, but also advancing the broader field of time series forecasting."

De resultaten toonden geen significante relaties tussen zowel ASMG als PSMG op eenzaamheid. Er bleek wel een significant moderatie effect te zijn bij ASMG. Jongens rapporteerden meer eenzaamheid bij hogere niveaus van ASMG, terwijl meisjes minder eenzaamheid lieten zien bij hogere niveaus van ASMG. Sekse bleek geen modererende rol te spelen in de associatie tussen PSMG en eenzaamheid. De resultaten laten zien dat het in de opzet van preventie- en interventieprogramma’s voor eenzaamheid belangrijk is om jongens bewust te maken van de negatieve gevolgen van ASMG."

Differences in sensor properties on these satellites create variations between sensing. A spectral alignment of the Landsat satellite series would be required to properly conduct longitudinal research on the development of the earth’s surface. In this thesis four different models, two ordinary least square regressions, a polynomial regression and a single layer neural network regression, were compared in their performance on the transformation of Landsat 8 and Landsat 5 on Landsat 7 in a spatially and non-spatially dependent situation. Furthermore was tested if the azimuth and elevation formed a meaningful contribution to the transformation model. Here we show that in the transformation from Landsat 8 to Landsat 7 and Landsat 5 to Landsat 7 the single layer neural network regression, with the addition of the azimuth and elevation, has the lowest root mean squared error on spatially independent data. On spatially dependent data did the ordinary least squares regression without the azimuth and elevation as predictors contain the lowest root mean squared error. However, on local spatially dependent data did the single layer neural network contain the lowest root mean squared error as well. The difference in performance between a single neural network regression and complex linear regressions could shows that even in its simplest form, the neural network architecture forms a better fit for these  ransformations. Future research could study the implementation of backwards compatibility models, assessing the structural validity of the model and allowing more complex neural network regressions."
"Assessment of the Coat Colour Phenotype of the Original Dutch Landrace goat, using a Machine Learning approach","['Beek, Milan van']","['Salah, Albert']",2023-08-11T00:02:37Z,EN,[],Applied Data Science,"The Dutch Landrace goat (Nederlandse Landgeit in Dutch) is a goat species that has lived in the Netherlands since the 17th century. From around 1906 until 1910 goat farmers cross-bred the original Dutch Landrace goat with other goat species, causing the original genes to be lost. In this paper, a data pipeline is designed to assess the coat colour phenotype of the original Dutch Landrace goat from old paintings. This is done to answer the research questions: What colour(s) does the coat of the Dutch Landrace goat consist of? and What pattern(s) does the coat of the Dutch Landrace goat consist of?

This research has shown that the colours black, brown and white occur in respectively 33,3%, 34,4% and 63,4% of goats. The three most common colour combinations are ’white’, ’brown and white’ and ’black and white’. Regarding coat patterns, it has been found that 58,3% of all observed goats contain one of four reoccurring patterns. These patterns are ’completely white’ (32,0%), ’dorsal stripe’ (13,3%), ’completely brown’ (9,3%) and ’black head with white body’ (4,0%).

These findings give goat breeders consensus about the historic appearance of the Dutch Landrace goat, so breeding standards can be formed to which can be bred. Additionally, although a limited amount of data could be used, the results of this research and the database that has been constructed could form a basis for further research."

Despite the fact that European migrants have the right to vote in local Dutch elections, the political language policy adopted by municipalities and political parties may exclude this group during crucial moments of public participation.
In the past decade, the number of non-Dutch-speaking eligible voters has substantially increased due to immigration, particularly in urban areas. This demographic trend poses questions about its possible connection to the declining local election turnout, reaching a historic low of 50% in 2022. Yet, little attention has been devoted to providing accessible information to non-Dutch-speaking residents. The persistence of Dutch as the dominant political language warrants investigation, as language can signify “exclusion” that extends beyond simply voting, holding both instrumental and symbolic effects. Offering political texts in multiple languages may increase engagement among a more diverse population.
This thesis explored how French residents in Utrecht perceive the linguistic access to local voting rights. A questionnaire was used to assess whether translations of electoral programs effectively reached the target audience. Additionally, the study employed a critical discourse analysis to examine the purpose and impact of the translations. Results indicate that translated election programs serve limited practical purposes within this research group. However, voting propensity is still lower among individuals who have lived in Utrecht for shorter periods. This group expressed a desire for more translated materials. Also the experienced group indicated a lack of essential information. Whereas translated election programs are not the decisive factor in voting decisions, all respondents positively embrace translated voting guides.
Furthermore, the assumption that this group would feel symbolically addressed by texts in their own language is questioned, as an overwhelming majority prefers information to be provided in English. Nevertheless, this does not mean translated materials have no instrumental or symbolic utility. Many respondents, especially recent newcomers, indicate that they need translations to make an informed voting decision, consequently motivating them to participate in local politics. Their participation in local politics is justified as their often short stay in Utrecht is part of a constant flow of migrants. Therefore, their vote may not impact them as individuals but future migrant groups. Ultimately, this study therefore advocates for the inclusion of English translations in political communication, such as voting guides, websites or social media, to enhance civic participation, specifically among non-Dutch-speaking residents, and to foster a more inclusive and representative democracy in the municipality of Utrecht.""""]"

The underlying logic stemming from the EU crisis literature is that crises are a driving force for European integration. To investigate this issue for the EU Member State Germany, quantitative tools of sentiment analysis and topic modelling are employed on a data set of parliamentary speeches and press releases. This discourse analysis is supplemented by a qualitative investigation of selected speech acts. The results show that German policymakers acknowledged the issue salience of integration in EU CFSP and voice willingness for integratory steps as a reaction to the crisis in Ukraine. Nevertheless, the analysis also uncovered a contradictory relationship between such acknowledgment and the usage of committing language by the German executive. The results of this study, therefore, highlight the historically complicated relationship between the European Union and its Member States in questions of sovereignty and accordingly point towards more general questions of how political integration in EU Member States is communicated to its citizens."
Nudging towards vegetarian meal choice in restaurants: An examination of the effectiveness of menu nudges and the role of meal expectations,"['Smits, Michelle']","['Weijers, R.J.']",2023-08-17T00:01:29Z,EN,['vegetarian meal choice; menu nudges; meal expectations; healthy eating; sustainable eating'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","People are increasingly eating out in restaurants, where they prefer to eat meat, which negatively impacts environment and health. Despite people intending to reduce their meat intake, their behaviour fails to change. One way to change behaviour is by nudging. In this online experimental study, 509 Dutch participants were randomly assigned over four conditions (i.e., control, appealing description, recommendation, visibility enhancement) to compare three menu nudges in their effectiveness in increasing vegetarian meal choice. Two out of three menu nudges, which restaurant owners consider acceptable, positively impacted vegetarian meal choice in an online restaurant setting. As expected, framing a meal in an appealing, taste-focused, way (i.e., appealing description) and stating a meal as chef’s favourite (i.e., recommendation) resulted in more vegetarian meal choices than increasing the salience of a meal (i.e., visibility enhancement). It was argued that these two nudges, which both provide decision information, would be more effective because they change people’s expectations about vegetarian meals (i.e., tastiness, indulgence, popularity, safe choice in taste). However, the effectiveness of the nudges could not fully be explained by changing meal expectations; only tastiness mediated the relationship between the appealing description and vegetarian meal choice. Future research is necessary to explain what factors contribute to the effectiveness of nudges. Finally, it is recommended for restaurants owners and policy makers to use either the appealing description or recommendation nudge to promote healthy and sustainable eating."
Third Culture Kids: Social Competence and Sense of Belonging,"['Connally, Laura']","['Liber, Juliette']",2023-08-17T00:01:26Z,EN,['Third Culture Kids; Sense of Belonging; Relocation; Social Competence'],Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"The increasingly globalized world yields a growing population of Third Culture Kids (TCKs); 
youth who are born in one country and move to at least one other country amidst their developmental 
years. TCKs often live highly mobile lives, relocating frequently due to their parent's careers, and 
assimilating within communities of other TCKs and their ex-patriot families. With numerous relocations, 
TCKs are thought to develop high levels of social competence for meeting new people and integrating 
within diverse cultures. However, frequent relocation also fosters grief for lost relationships, 
disconnection, and difficulty establishing deep friendships. Social acceptance and relationships are 
recognized as foundational components of sense of belonging (SOB), an innate, psychological need 
necessary for optimal human development. Current literature suggests that TCKs develop high levels of 
social competence that help them become accepted in diverse social contexts, but frequent relocations 
thwart their ability to establish deep friendships. With little research to date on how TCKs establish SOB, 
this study analyzed how social competence correlates with SOB in TCKs who attend two international 
schools in the Netherlands. Furthermore, the moderation effect of low versus high relocation instances on 
the relationship between social competence and SOB was examined. Sixty-seven students aged 9 to 16 
years participated in this study and completed the Social Skills Improvement System Rating scales (SSiS-
RD 8-12; SSiS-RS 13-18), General Sense of Belonging Scale (GBS), and transitional questions regarding 
the number of times relocated. It was hypothesized that social competence would positively correlate with
SOB and that a greater number of relocations would negatively affect the relationship. Data collection is 
ongoing. Preliminary findings will be discussed in light of understanding how TCKs develop SOB in 
their transitory life."

Nevertheless, vitality showed a significant correlation with well-being, which gives room for further research to be done. Moreover, the person-environment fit was proved to be a predictor of well-being, however, showing a weaker correlation compared to vitality. Future research should include other theoretical perspectives and multiple dimensions of workload which could yield a more accurate result and comprehensive understanding of the concept. Finally, it highlights the importance of considering vitality as an outcome and predictor of well-being and the benefits of enhancing person-environment fit in organizations. In conclusion, the use of qualitative research methods to gain a deeper understanding of the specific aspects through which workload influences well-being is strongly recommended."
Justly Closing the Loop in South Africa,"['Mono, Katharina']","['Dittgen, Romain']",2023-08-17T00:01:20Z,EN,['Circular Economy; Just Transition; South Africa; Inequalities'],Sustainable Development,"In the light of climate change, there is a need to shift away from South Africa’s resource intensive economy. Recently, more focus on making resource use more sustainable has been put to a circular economy; however the social dimension has not fully been explored in the context of transitioning to a circular economy. In a country with high and persisting inequalities, accounting for social aspects in a circular economy is of utmost importance. South Africa’s socio-economic and spatial inequalities are still deeply engrained in its society, in large parts informed by the legacy of Apartheid. Thus, this research looks at aspects that must be considered in a just transition to a circular economy. This is done with a literature review, workshops, and interviews with stakeholders across the country from various sectors carried out in Cape Town and Johannesburg. Various key aspects to account for in a just circular economy transition were identified. These include the country’s Apartheid history, and the consequences this still has today. Further relevant barriers are access to services and infrastructure, inlcuding energy, water, education, technology, and the current economic, political, and labour situation. Governance, policy, investment and funding, data and research, and psychological factors were identified as challenges. Some key recommendations on specific projects to tackle these challenges were identified. These include recommendations in nine key focus areas.  The findings are contextualised using various frameworks, psychological and development theories. It is argued that current theoretical models may not sufficiently be able to account for deeply engrained inequalities or the social political and economic challenges South Africa is facing. Individuals' agency in a country shaped by  systematic inequalities may be restrained due to lack of access to basic needs. This lack disadvantages the people insaid systems, resulting in the lack of agency or feeling thereof. To transition to a just circular economy various enabling factors and constraining factors were identified. Inequalities and structural challenges, political and economic considerations, resource limitations, lack of data and information and a resistance to change may hamber a transition. Increasing stakeholder engagement and collaboration, trasnparent and accountable leadership, and increased education, awarenss, innovation, and technology were identified as an opportunity to transition. Solutions must be tailored to the local context to account for country-specific challenges. Future research into various aspects, including greater engagement with low icnome communities to develop context specific solutions to socio-economic and ecological issues, are made."

The findings revealed a significant positive relationship between menstruation and pain, indicating higher pain levels during menstruation compared to non-menstruation days, both during working and non-working days. However, no significant direct or mediated effects were observed for pain on performance or the moderating effects of workload and cognitive job demands on the relationship between pain and presenteeism. These results emphasize the importance of further research to explore additional mediators and moderators that may contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the intricate dynamics between menstrual pain, work-related outcomes, and contextual factors. By uncovering these underlying mechanisms, future studies can inform the development of targeted interventions and support systems to address the challenges faced by individuals experiencing menstrual pain in the workplace."

Pioneering these pursuits is the first generation of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors (DNMTi), which incite global cellular DNA hypomethylation. This elevates tumour immunogenicity by the restoring antigen processing machinery, re-establishing cancer antigen expression, enhancing cytotoxic T cell tumour infiltration and inducing viral mimicry. The resultant anti-tumour response proved effective in eliminating certain myeloid malignancies, with DNMTis receiving FDA-approval for the treatment of multiple leukaemic disorders. However, their application in lymphomas and solid tumours demonstrated disappointing results, paralleling the outcomes obtained with other well-established epigenetic therapies. Because of this, the research focus has largely shifted from monotherapies to combinatorial approaches incorporating alternative oncotherapies. Preclinical research revealed that DNMTi-induced genome-wide demethylation can reverse chemoresistance and T cell exhaustion, thereby sensitizing refractory tumours to chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic interventions. They were also shown to synergize with other epigenetic therapies e.g.  histone deacetylases (HDAC), lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibitors, greatly reducing tumour growth and progression in mouse models. The potency of combination treatments is evident in in vivo models, however translation into the clinic has yielded mixed results. Despite this, they wield immense potential that will require a great deal of clinical testing to be fully realized, although the application of powerful auxiliary technologies like nanoparticle-based drug delivery and CRISPR/Cas9 may accelerate this process."
Digital Green Nudges to Fight Food Waste,"['Brun, Elias']","['Herder, E.']",2023-08-25T00:00:47Z,EN,[],Human-Computer Interaction,"The present thesis focuses on examining young adults' food waste behaviour and the effectiveness of digital nudges in promoting sustainable behaviours through food waste reduction apps. The research begins with a comprehensive literature review on food waste, digital nudging, and relevant theoretical frameworks. A mixed-methods approach was employed, involving a questionnaire survey and focus groups to gather data from participants who used food waste reduction apps for a week.

By analysing survey and focus groups data collected before and after app usage, this research highlights a prevalent concern among participants regarding food waste, as well as a personal commitment to minimising it through various strategies. Participants' feedback provides valuable insights for improving app features and user experience, including enhanced intuitiveness, connectivity with household members, and flexible expiration dates. The study aligns with established theories on climate change perception and emphasises the need for tailored green nudges to foster sustainable behaviour change.

The thesis concludes by acknowledging limitations, including usability issues, potential response bias, and limited generalisability. Suggestions for future research include exploring different types of nudges, quantifying the impact of app usage on behaviour change, and conducting long-term studies. By addressing these areas, stakeholders can develop more effective interventions and strategies for reducing food waste among young adults and beyond.

Ultimately, the insights gained from this study can inform the design of more effective app-based nudges, enhance individuals' engagement with food waste reduction efforts, and contribute to the broader goal of achieving sustainable environmental practices."
The impact of the tacrolimus concentration/dose ratio on kidney function in heart transplant recipients,"['Seijkens, Boris']","['Binkhorst, L.']",2023-08-25T00:00:56Z,EN,"['tacrolimus, heart transplantation, concentration/dose ratio, kidney function']",Farmacie,"Background. Tacrolimus is the backbone of immunosuppression after heart transplantation (HTx). Although being highly effective, nephrotoxicity is a frequent complication. Tacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity is considered to be an important cause of kidney disease after HTx. The tacrolimus concentration/dose ratio (C0/D-ratio) is a reflection of the metabolic rate of a patient for tacrolimus. Recent studies demonstrated a relationship between the tacrolimus C0/D-ratio and adverse clinical outcomes, including nephrotoxicity in solid organ transplantation, mainly kidney transplants. We investigated the impact of the tacrolimus C0/D-ratio on kidney function, assessed with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), in HTx-recipients. 

Methods. This was a retrospective study in HTx-recipients who were treated with tacrolimus as initial immunosuppression for at least six months after transplantation. Data on C0/D-ratio and eGFR were collected at three and six months, and at one, three and five years post-HTx. Patients were categorized into four tacrolimus metabolism groups based on the median C0/D-ratio of the population. A linear mixed model was performed to assess the correlation between time-varying C0/D-ratio and time-varying eGFR. Additionally, multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the relationship between the C0/D-ratio and eGFR at the different time points. Furthermore, a survival analysis between the four groups was carried out.

Results. Two-hundred and nine HTx-recipients were included. No relationship between time-varying logarithmically-transformed (Log) C0/D-ratio and time-varying eGFR was found in the linear mixed model (p = 0.71). However, the Log tacrolimus C0/D-ratio was positively associated with eGFR at three months, six months and one year after HTx in multivariate analyses (p = 0.02, p<0.001, and p = 0.009, respectively). Finally, no noticeable difference in survival rate was found between the four groups (p = 0.25). 

Conclusions. The Log tacrolimus C0/D-ratio was positively associated with kidney function up to one year after HTx in multivariate analyses, but no association was found between time-varying Log C0/D-ratio and eGFR in a linear mixed model. So, the question remains whether a real association is present."
Burden of adverse drug reactions associated with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in rheumatoid arthritis patients.,"['Groenhuis, Thomas']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-08-25T00:00:49Z,EN,['Burden; ADRs; Rheumatoid Arthritis; bDMARDs; csDMARDs; tsDMARDs; corticosteroids; Burden domains;'],Farmacie,"Abstract

Background: 
The burden of ADRs related to treatments of various diseases are lesser known or not thoroughly defined. Rheumatoid arthritis is a complex disease with many different therapeutic options used to slow down disease progression and improve the quality of life for the people dealing with this disease. The aim of this article is to assess and compare the burden of the ADRs of DMARDs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 

Methods: 
This was a cross-sectional study of data collected in the Dutch ADR Monitor, with patients being sent bimonthly questionnaires. A section of these questionnaires contained follow up questions specifically focused on the burden of any reported ADRs caused by one or multiple DMARDs used for treatment of the RA patients. The burden of these ADRs could be reported for the following seven domains: appearance, medical treatment, daily activities, fatigue, mental health, physical and course. The burden scores per drug group were displayed using a likert type scale. Data was analyzed using Kruskal Wallis and Dunn tests, and presented using a ten point likert type scale. 

Results: 
A total of 48 rheumatoid arthritis patients were included (71.4% female) and reported 78 ADRs. In the mental health domain a significant difference (p=0.044) was found between bDMARDs and csDMARDs. As a whole csDMARDs don’t have a higher or lower burden than other DMARDs or corticosteroids. 

Conclusion: 
These results provide a first look into what burden data could add to current and future treatment considerations. The currently available data shows bDMARDs being more burdensome than csDMARDs in the mental health domain. A larger sample size or database will allow for other and more observations to be made in the future."
Towards a zero-emission construction site by utilizing a fuel cell-battery system and renewable energy,"['Bakker, Peter']","['Gibescu, Madeleine']",2023-08-25T00:00:58Z,EN,['Zero-emission construction site; LFP battery; PEM fuel cell; hydrogen;'],Energy Science,"The construction sector is a large energy consumer, contributes to the global GHG emissions
significantly, and is a conservative sector where positive change goes slowly. In addition to that, 
current diesel-fuelled construction sites have additional negative impacts such as the emission of 
nitrogen and PMx, as well as excessive noise. Although technical solutions for electrification and 
increasing energy efficiency are available, however, several socio-techno-economic barriers limit their 
implementation. This study examined five potential configurations for electrifying a pilot construction 
site utilizing the Dutch electricity grid, an LFP battery, and a PEM fuel cell (FCPB-system) in different 
sizes. The results indicate that the electricity grid and a battery are currently the cheapest option; while 
PEM fuel cells and green hydrogen are very expensive. However, green hydrogen is the most 
environmentally friendly option compared to the Dutch electricity grid now and in the future. The 
yearly energy costs from the FCPB-system are significantly higher compared to the fuel costs of current 
diesel machinery. The LCOS and LCOE of the LFP battery and PEM fuel cell respectively, are mostly
sensitive to a change in efficiency, technical lifetime, and electricity/hydrogen price. From an 
environmental perspective, the FCPB-system can reduce CO2 emissions in the conservative 
construction sector. Additionally, the FCPB-system does not emit any nitrogen due to the absence of 
combustion and high temperatures which is currently an important benefit for the construction sector 
in The Netherlands. One additional advantage of the FCPB-system is the capability of utilizing 
renewable energy. The results indicate that configurations with a battery have the most potential for 
utilizing renewable energy on construction sites. The energy cost reduction increases with the increase 
of battery size and use and the use of expensive green hydrogen; while CO2 emission reduction is 
mostly found in the grid-connected configurations. Renewable energy is very interesting for reducing 
energy costs and further a reduction in CO2 emissions."

For each of the cases we implement the method of incompressible elements. We conclude that the set of

The dataset of the cross-sectional study of HBSC 2021 was used. Which took a sample of 7258 Dutch adolescents in schools (M = 13.9, SD = 1.9). Contrary to predictions, SES has no direct association with perceived school pressure when controlled for age and gender. Perceived school pressure was lower in adolescents who receive more parental support, regardless of age or gender. Being older and a girl showed a higher amount of perceived school pressure. The study concludes that to understand perceived school pressure, important factors as parental support must be considered as well as age and gender, while SES is not an important factor. Future research should investigate what sort of parental support is most influential (e.g., emotional or material) and what differentiates amount of pressure based on age and gender."

To address the social, economic, and environmental issues, interventions such as urban nature-based solutions (UNBS) are being implemented. An Urban living lab (ULL) is envisioned as a collaborative space that encourages innovation and brings stakeholders together to achieve a common goal. This study concentrates on how ULLs can promote UNBS and stakeholder co-creation. The paper takes a qualitative approach and focuses on an ongoing ULL in Utrecht's City Centre. The study reveals three key roles of ULLs that can promote UNBS and encourage stakeholder co-creation. These roles are trust building, scaling up predefined innovations and fostering inclusive social outcomes. By taking on these roles, UNBS can overcome its barriers, both socio-economic and biophysical. The study, therefore, highlights the benefits of ULLs, in promoting sustainable urban development by providing a collaborative space for stakeholders to perform better towards achieving UNBS. ULLs’ characteristics such as stakeholder co-creation, user management, and innovation can potentially enable UNBS to tackle its barriers in a real-life context.

Concluding, this study adds value to both theory and practice by improving the understanding of how ULLs can facilitate the planning, execution, and management of UNBS."
The social identity of user innovators in the creative industries: an investigation of diffusion in the anime environment,"['Pacher, Simone']","['Jong, Jeroen de']",2023-09-06T10:00:40Z,EN,['User Innovation | Diffusion failure | Social Identity | Anime Industry | Incentives'],Business Development and Entrepreneurship,"This Master's thesis conducts an explorative investigation into the social identities of user innovators operating within the creative industries, with a particular focus on the Anime environment. It is driven by the research question: ""What are the social identities of user innovators that diffuse in the Anime environment?"" Employing an inductive approach, this study uses in-depth interviews as its primary method for data collection and leverages the MEC technique, grounded theory, and the reservoir technique for a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of the gathered data. Our analysis leads to the identification of four distinct social identities of user innovators: Commercial, Communitarian, Artistic, and Communicative. Each of these identities exhibits distinct characteristics that map onto key dimensions of social identity and demonstrate a predilection for specific diffusion pathways. This research underscores the critical importance of understanding the social identities of user innovators in effectively tackling the widespread issue of diffusion failure. We outline practical strategies for industry practitioners, aiming to provide actionable insights that can encourage and facilitate the diffusion of user-driven innovations. This study marks a significant contribution to the scholarly discourse on user innovation, social identity, and diffusion processes within the landscape of creative industries."
Does financial inclusion enhance or weaken financial stability? Exploring their relationship in Latin American countries,"['Fernandez Tinoco, Andrea']","['Karatas, Bilge']",2023-09-06T10:00:37Z,EN,"['Financial Inclusion, Financial Stability, Latin America, Panel Data']",Banking and Finance,"This study investigates the effect of financial inclusion on financial stability in Latin American countries during the period 2004-2021, since governments in this region have intensified their efforts to promote financial inclusion policies after the global financial crisis. By using a random effects model, a positive significant effect of the financial inclusion index on financial stability, measured by the Z-Score, is observed for 11 Latin American countries during this sample period. This result is robust with the NPL ratio as a dependent variable, which reflects the degree of financial instability. Furthermore, similar findings are obtained when replacing the financial inclusion index with the usage and penetration dimension of financial inclusion. The results, which are consistent with the findings of previous studies, can be mainly explained by three key benefits that financial inclusion brings to financial stability. These include the diversification of bank’s loan portfolio, a stable retail base of deposits, as well as the lower costs of funding associated with the growth of retail deposits."
Investigating the effects of social media on global citizenship identity and its role in prosocial decision-making behaviors.,"['Gregorek, Katia']","['Kim, Hyunji']",2023-09-06T09:41:50Z,EN,[],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","With an increase in the existence of social media platforms, becoming staples in Generation Z’s lives, this research investigates how the relationship between Social Media Usage (SMU) and Prosocial Behavior (PB) is positively mediated by Global Citizen Identity (GCI). Social Media platforms have been found to negatively impact psychological well-being and social involvement (Roberts & David, 2022). Prior research has identified Generation Z is becoming a cohort of globally engaged citizens (Dalton, 2009), which has been theorized to be a result of increased GCI. We have observed Social Media sites, be utilized to attract attention to movements such as #BLM, #MeToo, and #WalkForOurLives. Moreover, there has been a rise in open discussions on environmental and political movements. This cross-sectional study investigates how higher frequencies of SMU, specifically amongst members of Gen Z born between 1997 and 2004, influence an increase in PB through the mediation of GCI. With a total of 160 participants, this study demonstrated a positive correlation between all variables, supporting the hypotheses and belief that a higher level of social media usage would increase GCI and in turn result in higher PB. A partial mediation was identified, suggesting the role of other variables in the relationship between SMU and PB. The implications of this research are to understand how Social Media platforms can be capitalized to benefit society."

European countries, utilizing carbon dioxide emissions per capita as a proxy for transition risk. Seven 
additional variables that potentially may impact government bonds are incorporated into the model.
This study employs a fixed effects panel regression approach using yearly data for 21 European Union 
countries from 2006 to 2021. The analysis is conducted for the entire period as well as two sub-periods, 
allowing the examination before and after the implementation of the Paris Agreement 2015. The 
findings indicate that CO2 emissions per capita are not priced into the yields. Furthermore, the dataset 
presents highly significant time effects. Therefore, it can be implied that carbon risk is undervalued in 
financial markets, which entails financial concerns for carbon-intensive economies and investors. Thus,
sovereign bonds from these countries should be considered riskier and with the possibility of 
experiencing an abrupt fall in their market value in the future. To mitigate the potential negative impact, 
investors should diversify their portfolios and invest in bonds from sustainable-driven governments."

Based on the pace at which it happens,
social change is divided into incremental and dramatic social change. People respond
to both types with different coping mechanisms and behaviors. In this study, we aimed 
to investigate whether incremental and dramatic social change elicit threat and 
challenge responses in people. We integrated sociology and psychology by measuring 
threat and challenge of social change in an experimental setting, using real-world 
themes (global warming and immigration) that induce social change in contemporary 
Dutch society. 61 Dutch citizens read a text describing the status quo, followed by a 
text describing social change regarding both themes. Afterwards, they self-reported 
their threat and challenge responses, and the rate at which they perceived the social
change to happen. Contrary to expectations, incremental social change (global
warming) elicited a stronger threat response compared to dramatic social change 
(immigration). Furthermore, social change of global warming elicited a weaker 
challenge response than status quo of global warming, and we found no difference 
between social change and status quo of immigration. Finally, the perceived rate of 
social change was found to be related to the threat response. The results of this study 
shed light on the psychological responses to social change and the way people cope 
with it. A better understanding of these responses is crucial for perception
management and an adequate distribution of coping resources, as well as to 
understand whether distinguishing social change in incremental and dramatic is useful 
to researchers interested in the psychological consequences of social change."

Aan de hand van het gedachtegoed van De Tocqueville wordt het spanningsveld tussen democratie en individuele vrijheid uiteengezet, en wordt ingegaan op het hedendaagse concept van illiberale democratieën. Fundamentele rechten spelen een belangrijke rol om een liberale democratie liberaal te houden. Naast fundamentele rechten speelt ook de democratische cultuur een essentiële rol om een democratie niet te laten omslaan in een Tocquevilliaanse tirannie van de meerderheid. Het Nederlandse politieke systeem legt grote nadruk op de rol van de formele wetgever voor de bescherming van fundamentele rechten. Grondrechten hebben zo een belangrijke normatieve functie in de Nederlandse democratische cultuur. Internationaal- en Unierechtelijke bescherming van fundamentele rechten ziet vooral toe op de proportionaliteit en noodzakelijkheid van beperkingen van fundamentele rechten. De voorgestelde nationale beperkte vorm van constitutionele toetsing versterkt, mede door specifiek nationale omstandigheden, de bescherming van fundamentele rechten tegenover de overheid. Invoering van constitutionele toetsing zou zo een extra waarborg vormen voor de bescherming van fundamentele rechten, zonder dat de fundamentele rechtenbescherming die uitgaat van de democratisch gelegitimeerde wetgever (substantieel) vermindert."
"Greening the City, Displacing the Community: Exploring the Nexus of Green Urbanism, Environmental Gentrification, and Citizenship in Prague","['Neutkens, Iris']","['Henig, David']",2023-09-06T10:09:51Z,EN,['Environmental gentrification; citizenship; green urbanism; Prague;'],Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship,"This thesis looks at how people engage with and are affected by urban greening projects in Prague, Czech Republic. Greening projects, such as parks and gardens, increase the quality of life by decreasing the environmental risks in urban contexts. The idea behind the implementation of greening projects is called green urbanism (Bhargava et al. 2020). Green urbanism seems like a neutral strategy to reduce environmental risks, however, it also contributes to social inequalities. Environmental gentrification refers to the process where low-income and often non-white residents are excluded from their homes due to the implementation of greening projects, and are displaced by new, higher-income, and often white residents who are attracted by the greening projects (Checker 2011; Dooling 2009). Green urbanism is thus influenced by aspects of intersectionality since race and class determine whether you are included or excluded from greening projects and creates contestations over citizenship. Based on three months of fieldwork in Prague, this thesis describes how processes of green urbanism occur in the boroughs of Letná, Bubeneč, Holešovice, and Libeň. The anthropological methods of participant observation, (semi-) structured interviews, online ethnography, and walking ethnography are followed to answer the main question, which is: How are residents of the boroughs of Letná, Bubeneč, Holešovice, and Libeň engaging with, and are affected by, processes of green urbanism, and what forms of citizenship are engendered by these? I argue that six different forms of citizenship emerge from the inclusion and exclusion of greening projects, which are green, educative, self-caring, and inclusive citizenship for the people who engage in greening projects, and marginalized and protective citizenship for the people who are affected by green urbanism."

Three  instruments are identified as exemplary for the EU approach: Frontex, soft law instruments, and CSDP-based migration control missions. Through the use of these instruments, the EU and its Member States hope to avoid human rights obligations and responsibility for human rights violations vis a vis migrants. This challenges the requirements of the rule of law, for which this study uses the following working definition: ensuring systemic accountability for incongruences between human rights law and acts of government through ensuring access to a court. It is established that for each of the three neo-refoulement instruments the rule-of-law-principles of legality and effective judicial protection are undermined due to the fact that there is no proper accountability mechanism in place. As the EU might soon accede to the ECHR, the ECtHR might be able to ensure that the EU will be held accountable. After examining the new draft accession agreement between the EU and the Council of Europe, it is found that it will remain virtually impossible to hold the EU accountable for human rights violations committed against migrants in the context of CSDP-based migration control missions and soft law agreements, yet it might result in accountability for transgressions committed by Frontex officers that are under the direct control of the EU"
Corporate social responsibility and/or excess returns?

The study covers 3,284 firms from 2018 until 2022 in Western and Northern Europe, Canada and North America across a multitude of industries. First-differenced panel regression analysis and factor models were used to evaluate the hypotheses of the study. The results show strong evidence in favour of a U-shaped relationship between ESG scores and firm performance and value. ESG initially negatively affects a firm’s performance measures. However, the marginal long-run effect of ESG scores is positively associated with firm efficiency. Further, environmental scores have an immediate positive effect on the ROA in industries that are more competitive than average. Lastly, I conclude that high ESG score portfolios are less systemically risky and tend to produce higher excess returns compared to low ESG score portfolios. This study sheds light on the complex relation between ESG scores and firm performance by examining the non-linear relationship between the two."

While its approach towards Italy, Austria, and Japan was comparably lenient, Israel decided to completely reject any formal ties with the two German states and the State of Spain. This thesis analyses the similarities in the diplomatic approaches Israel chose for West Germany and Spain even though they were involved in the war and the Holocaust at varying levels and degrees. Herein, the research focuses on the cases of the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Spain, leaving out the German Democratic Republic. It encompasses the period between 1948, when Israel declared its independence, and 1955, when the occupation of West Germany ended, and Spain was admitted to the United Nations. Through the analysis of a collection of primary sources created in Israel’s Foreign Ministry, the Prime Minister’s Office, and the consultation of relevant secondary sources, this thesis presents two diplomatic approaches; one based on moral considerations, and another based on pragmatic reasoning that Israel employed vis à-vis the two case studies. The findings are further applied to Yehudit Auerbach’s theory of Turning Point Decisions (TPD) and Adam B. Lerner’s theory of collective memory. In the case of West Germany, moral diplomacy has been successfully employed to engage in direct negotiations over reparations payments for the crimes committed by the Nazis during the Holocaust and eventually led to the ratification of the Luxembourg Agreement in 1953. Once the Israeli government recognised that moral diplomacy had reached its limits, it changed its West German foreign policy to an approach based on Realpolitik that aimed at deepening the established ties. In the Spanish case, moral diplomacy became a tool to uphold the memory of the Holocaust in the international sphere as Israel rejected any diplomatic relations with the Iberian state on the grounds of the regime’s collaboration with the Nazis and the fact that, at the time, this regime was still in power. When the Jewish state realised that this approach did not lead to any benefits in the international arena anymore, it decided, through pragmatic considerations, to adapt its Spain policy in line with the approach of its Western allies."
Local peacebuilding in the shadow of the agreement: the role of grassroot initiatives in the lasting peace process of San Carlos,"['Aarden, Rim']","['Slooter, Luuk']",2023-09-14T00:01:12Z,EN,['lasting peace; grassroot initiatives; local peacebuilding; 2016 peace agreement; Colombia; San Carlos; peace strategies; image of peace; peacebuilding obstacles'],Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"After the end of the protracted conflict in Colombia, a considerable formal peace process started that was meant to bring lasting peace to the entire country. However, rural communities such as the municipality of San Carlos, through its separation from the center, experience little of the ambitious promises of justice, reparations and structural change incorporated in the 2016 peace agreement. As a response, grassroot initiatives have started peace projects in the municipality to create a local peace process instead. Building on literature surrounding the local turn and grassroots peacebuilding, this thesis offers a new analytical framework to understand how the relationship between local and state peacebuilding is influenced both by existing dynamics and the introduction of a peace agreement. The framework shows how this distinction correlates to the different top-down peacebuilding limitations and bottom-up peacebuilding strategies and obstacles. This is then applied to empirical data coordinated around the grassroot initiatives in San Carlos and generated using qualitative fieldwork methods such as semi-structured interviews and participant observation. This shows how with the introduction of the formal peace process, new local expectations and images of peace were created that the government now does not have the capacity or political will to fulfill, thereby complicating the already disconnected relationship between rural grassroots initiatives and the Colombian government. However, the persistent and diverse peace strategies of the grassroot initiatives show the possibility for a more cooperative relationship with the official peace process if this disconnect would lessen."

A global atlas of river morphologies,"['Glenewinkel-Meyer, Alisa']","['Beelen, Daan']",2023-09-14T00:00:52Z,EN,['rivers; fluvial morphology; SWOT; geomorphology; classification'],"Earth, Life and Climate","Assessments of planform river morphology have historically been limited in scope. Today, remote sensing technology is powerful enough to enable global coverage of the world’s rivers. 
Existing river morphology classification schemes have historically tended to be somewhat idiosyncratic, being shaped by the experience and functional goals of the classifier. Here, I explore the output of a simple classification algorithm on a globally spanning dataset of the world’s rivers in order to lay the groundwork for extending previously localized analyses to a worldwide scale. 
Allen & Pavelsky have mapped the global extent of rivers and streams as well as their widths, Frasson et al. examined the statistical relationships between width, slope, catchment area, meander wavelength, sinuosity, and discharge, and Altenau et al. expanded and refined the global map of rivers. Attempts to classify rivers based on shared characteristics are as varied and numerous as rivers themselves.
In geomorphological practice, rivers are generally differentiated by substrate (bedrock vs. sediment), sediment caliber, and channel pattern (straight/meandering, braided, anastomosing). These definitions are partially quantified, partially qualitative. Our goal was to parametrize the criteria for differentiating rivers by their planform morphology and examine whether strict application of these criteria by an algorithm would give the same results as assessment by a human expert. Additionally, I examined whether the statistical relationships and patterns established by spatially localized studies hold true on a global scale. Based on river centerlines and channel numbers from the NASA Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission river database, I assess planform morphology of the world’s rivers wider than 30 m. I use a simple algorithm to sort individual river reaches into the broad morphological categories braided, anastomosing, and meandering, and examine spatial distribution and relative prevalence of individual morphological groups. I find that single-threaded rivers are overwhelmingly meandering, with only very short sections fulfilling the criteria for planform morphology defined as straight. Channel number and reach sinuosity are insufficient to accurately categorize planform morphology for multi-threaded rivers. Further, principal component analysis of physical parameters included in the Surface Water and Ocean Topography river database shows that width, slope, water surface elevation, and flow accumulation do not appear to follow any trends related to expected morphological categories. I thus conclude that one or more parameters necessary for accurate empirical classification of planform river morphologies are not contained in the databases analyzed. I suggest adding channel island color as an indicator of riparian vegetation as proxy for island stability and expanding the analysis to incorporate a range of temporal and spatial scales to examine whether these factors allow for definite empirical identification of planform river morphology."
The Allocation of Extremely Scarce Resources: Giving Mental Healthcare a Fair Chance,"['Vooijs, Uma']","['Wells, Thomas']",2023-09-14T00:00:59Z,EN,"['Mental healthcare; allocation; scarce; resources; weighted lottery; first-come, first-served']",Applied Ethics,"The lack of treatment of people in need of psychological help due to the long waiting lists within mental healthcare has been a topic of public debate for the past decades. With this thesis, rather than focussing on ways to shorten the waiting lists, I aimed to evaluate the methods that could be used to allocate mental healthcare resources. My first analysis was about the current allocation method that is generally applied: waiting lists with a first-come, first-served procedure. I have concluded that this method is not justified when it concerns the allocation of extremely scarce resources, which is the case in MHC. In order to develop a justifiable alternative to the current system, I applied a utilitarian, prioritarian and fairness approach to the MHC case respectively. I started with a utilitarian cost-effectiveness analysis because extreme scarcity requires the prioritisation of efficiency. Due to the conflicts of this approach with egalitarian and fairness principles, I consider this approach to be insufficient. Next I discussed a prioritarianist weighted CEA, to resolve the egalitarian concerns of utilitarianism. Because of the remaining concerns, I proposed the addition of a weighted lottery system. After discussing the necessity of the lottery requirement and possible concerns, I concluded that a weighted lottery with probabilities based on a weighted CEA should account for the most important principles of MHC resource allocation and therefore pose a promising alternative to the current system."
An approach to kill high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells by complement,"['Jongh, Rivka de']","['Strijp, Jos van']",2023-09-14T00:01:04Z,EN,['High-grade serous ovarian cancer; ovarian cancer ; ascites ; complement ; CD59 ; Factor H ; CD46 ; complement regulators ; YTH53.1'],Infection and Immunity,"Epithelial ovarian cancer is the sixth leading malignancy amongst women. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common and fatal subtype. Most patients develop ascites, which promotes metastasis through the peritoneal cavity by increased pressure and contains cytokines that stimulate immune escape. However, ascites may also contain components of an active immune system, such as complement factors and tumor-directed antibodies. The tumor cells protect themselves from complement killing through, for instance, overexpression of the complement inhibitors CD59 on membranes and Factor H in the fluid phase. Our goal is to study whether local inhibition of these complement inhibitors could allow antibodies and complement in ascites to kill tumor cells. 


We obtained ascites fluid samples (n=101) from ovarian cancer patients treated at the Helsinki University Hospital Women’s Clinic. The ascites samples were screened for the presence of tumor-directed IgG antibodies by immunoblotting. The presence of classical pathway (CP) complement factors in ascites was examined by in-house sandwich ELISA. We observed a wide diversity between patients in both levels and types of antibodies and CP activity in ascites samples. Hemolytic assays showed that monoclonal rat IgG2 anti-human CD59 (YTH53.1) allowed about 25% of ascites fluids to kill red blood cells at a comparable level as normal human serum. YTH53.1 and anti-Factor H increased HGSOC cytotoxicity by ascites fluids only slightly, but some ascites fluid samples, rich in tumor-directed IgG seem to result in higher cytotoxicity in combination with classical pathway complement-containing NHS. 


In summary, ascites fluids differ strongly in levels of HGSOC-directed IgG and classical complement activity. Ascites fluids with strongly reactive HGSOC-directed IgG seem to have more HGSOC cytotoxic capacity, especially in combination with NHS, which is slightly increased by anti-CD59 and anti-FH antibodies."
Targeted protein degradation of phospholamban for PLN treatment,"['Bentum, Sabine van']","['Lei, Zhiyong']",2023-09-14T00:01:02Z,EN,[],Biology of Disease,"Phospholamban is a protein in heart cells. The protein has a regulatory function in the working of the heart. Some people have a mistake in the genetic code (also called mutation) of the phospholamban protein. Due to this mutation the protein cannot function properly, this can result in a heart disease. People with this specific heart disease get standard heart failure care. The aim of this treatment is to reduce symptoms. However, at this moment it is not possible to cure the disease. To try to make it possible to cure this disease we have set up this research project. During this project we tried to make a so-called fusion protein, which is a protein which is fused to something else. Our fusion protein consists of an E3 ligase (protein part) and a nanobody against the phospholamban protein. The E3 ligase is a protein which has a role in the protein degradation of the cell. A nanobody is a special kind of antibody which can be derived from llamas. Llamas produce the nanobody if they are injected with the protein wherefore you want nanobodies. This injected protein will be recognized as foreign which result in the production of nanobodies. We first tried to let a llama produce the nanobody for us but that failed. We think that it failed due to the fact that the phospholamban protein of the lama looks very much the same as that of the human, and that the llama did not recognize it as a foreign protein. Therefore, another approach was needed to make the nanobody. In the literature, a synthetically (in the lab) produced nanobody, called VHHB4, is described. This nanobody is able to bind to the healthy phospholamban protein, and we wanted to know if this nanobody is also able to bind to the phospholamban protein with the mutation. We were able to confirm that this is indeed the case, moreover we showed that VHHB4 did not bind better to the healthy or mutated version of the protein. Because the VHHB4 nanobody was able to bind the mutated phospholamban, we decided to use this VHHB4 nanobody for the production of our fusion protein. After we produced our fusion protein, we tested it in cells if the fusion protein is able to reduce the phospholamban levels and can improve the function of the cells. This data showed inconclusiveness and therefore it is hard to draw a conclusion. Because the used nanobody binds to the mutated phospholamban as good as the healthy phospholamban protein, it cannot be used to treat the genetic disease. So, to cure the heart disease another approach is needed."

Analysis of Sustainable and Green Urbanism Discourses: Cases study of New Smart-forest City Kalimantan Indonesia,"['Ayu, Nitia']","['Noorloos, Femke van']",2023-09-29T23:00:49Z,EN,['indigenous community;smart-forest city;sustainability;green capitalism'],International Development Studies,"The green and sustainable urbanism discussion has become more crucial due to many new cities constructed. Moreover, “green” and “sustainable” cities have been promoted by many governments, developers, and intergovernmental organizations, including UN-Habitat, through New Urban Agenda and SDGs (Dryzek, 2005; de Vries, 2011; Rapoport, 2014; Koh et al.,2021). Previous studies found this term used to cover up the complexity problems to attract international investment, people, nation building, and many other reasons, and some studies also found a contradiction between the “green” branding such as eco-city, forest city, smart-city, and sustainable city terminologies (Chang and Sheppard, 2013; Caprotti, 2014; Cugurullo, 2017, Van Noorloos, 2017). Therefore, this research focuses on capital city relocation in Nusantara, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, built because of climate change in the previous capital city Jakarta. Moreover, the central government constructed this new city as
a smart-forest city. This research aims to understand the power relation between new city development and green and sustainable discourses.
This research was conducted in the early stage of development because the announcement of this new city was in 2019, and the Indonesian government expects the first phase of relocation will be in 2024. This research conducted critical discourse analysis by reviewing policy documents, interviews with stakeholders, and visual analysis. The participants of the interviews are representative of the stakeholder, such as central, provincial, and local governments, environmental organizations, indigenous community organizations, and the house of representatives who participate in policy making. Thus, this research captured the main discourse at the macro and local levels.
The research finding shows the domination of smart-forest city and economic growth discourse produced by the central government. Furthermore, this research argues that the central government power comes from long periods of territorialization and governmentalism regimes. This is proven by the strategies to mainstream their discourse,
such as legitimation from the rule of law and politics, experts, and recalling the history of capital city relocation as nation building. Besides, some challenging discourses include damaged ecosystems and the long period of marginalization. Also, there are accommodator discourses that try to include local people and environmental rehabilitation in new city development."
MEV in the Ethereum ecosystem and its implications for crypto venture capital investors,"['Swart, Pim']","['Roelfsema, Hein']",2023-09-29T00:00:43Z,EN,"['MEV, Ethereum, venture capital']",Science and Business Management,"MEV presents itself as a particularly stubborn problem that is a unique emergent property introduced by blockchain-based DeFi systems. The semi-fixed block times within these networks generate a novel asynchronous system, which directly impacts the applications built within said system. Combine this with an experimental design philosophy centered around creating robustly decentralized systems that function in absence of controlling centralized actors, and you get a Wild West parallel financial industry where lots of value is at stake and only the software code dictates how this value is interacted with. This unique cocktail of features found in permissionless, decentralized, and importantly valuable blockchains requires a complete rethinking of applied game theory, redesigns of technology, user-technology interactions, and regulatory frameworks. For the Ethereum network in particular, it is clear that under the status quo a significant amount of value in the network is being extracted by sophisticated actors, potentially threatening the decentralization and usability of the network, yet arguably simultaneously and paradoxically strengthening the security of the network."
Downscaling Forcing for Lake Garda using Neural Networks: Present & Future,"['Kovacs, Famke']","['Dijkstra, H.A.']",2023-09-29T00:01:14Z,EN,['Neural networks; downscaling; atmospheric data; temperature; wind velociy; Lake Garda'],Climate Physics,"Deep mixing events (DMEs) are an important aspect of the ecosystem in Lake Garda. To predict when DMEs will happen in
the future, especially when considering climate change, a hydrodynamical model is used (such as Delft3D). The input for such
models has to be atmospheric forcing with a high resolution. The northern part of Lake Garda lies between high mountain
5 ranges, where high-resolution observational atmospheric data is inaccessible due to sparse observational posts. Therefore, data
from the models of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction’s Global Forecasting System (NCEP GFS) for presentday,
and EC Earth (future climate scenarios model) are needed. These datasets, however, have too low of a resolution compared
to the lake size. NCEP has a resolution of 0.25◦ (17 km in width and 27 km in height), and EC Earth has a 25 km resolution.
Both datasets need to be dynamically downscaled, normally with a hydrodynamical model such as the Weather Research and
10 Forecasting (WRF) to 3 km or 4 km resolution. This, however, takes a lot of time; here, neural networks could prove to be very
useful. After a long time training the network (just under two weeks), downscaling new data takes significantly less time (a
couple of minutes). For the Lake Garda region, two different neural networks (Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs) will
be trained using the work of van Rijk (2022), who based his work on Stengel et al. (2020). The first neural network will use
training data from 2017 until May 2018, while the second network will use training data until 2020. The test data is from 2021,
15 and all data consists of the following variables: 2 m above surface temperature (T2m) and 10 m above surface wind velocity
(U10m and V10m). With the second neural network, a future test dataset will be downscaled from EC Earth 25 km resolution
to a 3 km resolution and compared to WRF 4 km. The validation metrics of the generated super-resolution, when compared
to the WRF data, are the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM). Improvements
to both SSIM and RMSE for all variables are observed with more training, though they do not improve at the same rate. For
20 future data, both are worse than the present-day data."

It seeks to understand what kind of social medicine educators constructed, and how they integrated social medicine’s academic and practical components. The article argues that, although many have declared its demise during the twentieth century, social medicine did not disappear from the medical curriculum. Instead, its purpose was transformed. The article distinguishes four tools relevant to social medicine education. The first three tools, ‘Roadmap to Health Landscape’, ‘Recipes for Research’, and ‘Social Engagement Manual’ were aimed to provide students with general tools for their future careers. However, from the 1970s onwards, social medicine lost its scientific appeal and educational reforms increasingly oriented medical education towards practice. Consequently, a fourth tool, ‘Handbook for Social Physicians’ gained prominence in the 1990s. Social medicine changed from a general to a specialised subject."

people are suffering from hunger. Vertical farming could be a way out, because it can improve the
amount of food we can produce per square meter. Growy is a very successful company attempting
to realize the vertical farming dream by automating the care for plants by robots. However, it is
becoming difficult to make sure all plants are growing properly. Currently, the crops are inspected
manually, but due to the increase of production, this is becoming very challenging. For this reason,
the monitoring process should become automated.
Insufficient nutrients can cause stress in microgreens, which will present by changing of the
color of the leaves. Because of this noticeable color change, computer vision could be a good
approach to solve the problem. To experiment with this, it is required that you can give plants
stress and see the stress in images. We show that stress can be induced, but it is difficult to visualize
due to constraints in the image-capturing system. When the system is improved, stress could be
detectable using machine learning, anomaly detection, specifically. These results are a first step in
automating health monitoring in microgreens growing in a vertical farm."
Proving What? On the Structure of Proof of Concept Research,"['Laan, Jop van der']","['Caret, Colin']",2023-09-29T00:00:56Z,EN,['proof of concept; artefact; strong creation; concept; technique; methodological knowledge; epistemic category; feasibility'],History and Philosophy of Science,"In his Representing and Intervening, Hacking (1983) argues that, contrary to common belief, many phenomena which the natural sciences investigate do not exist as such in nature. Rather, they only exist in highly specific, man-made experimental setups, and are as a result created by us themselves. Kroes (2014) has nuanced this by making a distinction between weak and strong creation: The phenomena Hacking talks about are weakly created, because they are not constructed according to an intelligent design. Artefacts like screwdrivers, bikes and scientific instruments are strongly created, because they are based on an intelligent design. While this latter category of objects usually lies outside of the realm of scientific investigation, one can find examples of research in which a seemingly strongly created object is created and investigated. This begs the question of the epistemic value of this type of research: Does the creation of these objects have an effect on scientific theory, for example? If it does not, what is the point of creating such an object for science? In this master thesis, I attempt to answer these questions by taking “proof of concept research” as a model for this kind of research. Building on previous work on the subject by Kendig (2016) and Elliott (2021), I introduce a framework to identify the relevant entities involved, as well as a relation between them. Using this framework, I argue that the products of proof of concept research are both strongly and weakly created. The epistemic products I identify reflect this duality: On the one hand techniques are developed which are relevant for the creation of artefacts. On the other hand the created object can act as a genuine object of investigation, and theoretical knowledge can be generated accordingly."
The Influence of Perceived Gender on Robot Abuse,"['Bagchi, Chandni']","['Graaf, M.M.A. de']",2023-09-29T00:00:53Z,EN,['human-robot interaction;gender;robot abuse;laboratory experiment;social robots'],Human-Computer Interaction,"A growing interest in social robotics underscores the need for comprehensive research on human-robot interaction to inform responsible robot design and application. Gender dynamics is a contentious topic in human-robot interaction, necessitating further investigation to address this gap in knowledge. The study involved 64 participants who interacted with a robot, subjecting it to punishment and reward while it performed two different tasks: equation solving and emotion recognition. Participants engaged with a robot that was made to appear either female or male. Subsequently, participants provided
their impressions of the robot. The study’s findings revealed that there was no statistically significant difference in the severity of the punishment given to the male and female robots, contrary to the initial expectation that female robots might be punished more harshly. Additionally, no significant difference was found in the mind attribution of the robots of different genders. Interestingly, both male and female robots received significantly less punishment during the emotion recognition task compared to the equation solving task. The absence of a significant difference in punishment based on the robot’s gendered appearance that participants did not display pronounced gender bias when interacting with these robots. The lower level of punishment during the emotion recognition task indicates that task context plays a crucial role in how individuals perceive and treat robots, which has practical implications for designing robot tasks and applications. While this study did not find significant gender-based differences in robot abuse, the experiment with embodied robots provides a foundation upon which future studies can expand. Further research in this area will be instrumental in designing responsible and ethical human-robot interactions in the future."
Green space and academic success,"['Bunt, Martijn']","['Helbich, Marco']",2023-09-29T00:00:50Z,EN,"['green space, school performance, Dutch education, CITO-test, percentage of green space']",Urban and Economic Geography,"The Dutch system of education has been praised for its high quality for years, and Dutch students are one of the highest educated in the world. However, it has been reported that Dutch school performances have been declining since 2006, and this decline in performance is worrying since school performance is a critical predicter of long-term success and well-being. The declining performances make it relevant to explore strategies that can potentially enhance academic outcomes, and green space has been associated with academic performance through a variety of different ways and could serve as a potential solution to the declining school performances. A body of research is already conducted on the association between green space and school performance, but a research gap still exists on this association for the Dutch case. This study tried to address this research gap by conducting a literature review and executing regression analyses to investigate to what extend school performances are associated with green space exposure in the surroundings of primary schools in the Netherlands. Data was used on the average CITO-test score per neighborhood and the percentage of land use per neighborhood, along with covariates of the average socio-economic status score, average household size, and average level of urbanicity per neighborhood in the Netherlands to perform OLS and GWR analyses. Multivariate regression models revealed significant associations between academic performance and percentage of green space per neighborhood in the Netherlands. The OLS regression analysis indicates a significant association between the average CITO-test score and the percentage of green space per neighborhood in the Netherlands. The GWR analysis shows localized dynamics and indicates a statistically significant and positive association between the percentage of green space, and the average CITO-test score per neighborhood in the Netherlands in neighborhoods in the central southern part of the country in line with previous studies. The outcomes of the analyses of this study have been sufficient to answer this study’s research question, and the findings of this study can provide valuable insights for educational policymakers, school administrators, and urban planners seeking to create conducive learning environments to improve the declining school performances in the Netherlands."
"Crowdsourcing for Innovation: Investigating the interaction- and contributor-related characteristics

intelligence of the crowd to generate new ideas and solutions more effectively. Not only can this be relevant
for the organisation to stay competitive, but also it has the potential to play a significant role in addressing
global challenges such as climate change, as the complexity and wickedness of such challenge requires
a wide range of perspectives that are not limited to one sector or discipline. It comes then without a surprise
that many scholars are interested in what makes these types of events successful in relation to the ideas
generated or the real-life impact made. Although the factors that contribute to success are widely
researched in the context of online crowdsourcing, research lacks on offline forms of crowdsourcing. Also,
whereas most crowdsourcing initiatives revolve around individual contributors solving problems, research
about crowdsourcing teams is scarce. In addition, most of those factors in relation to team success are
studied in isolation while there are many reasons to believe that these success factors show
interdependencies. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap by focusing on the interplay between
contributor- and interaction-related conditions that influence team success. This study applies a deductive
configurational design using Qualitative Comparative Analysis, which is inherently suitable for studying
interrelationships. The sample consists of 19 crowdsourcing teams that participated in the Circular
Challenge, an offline team-based crowdsourcing for innovation event that revolves around
commercialising excess waste streams in the context of the circular economy. Structured interviews and
self-completion surveys were conducted among representatives of these teams. This was analysed with
csQCA. The findings show that contributor-related and interaction-related conditions are important for
team success and that crowdsourcing teams can become successful through an internal pathway and
through an external pathway. Moreover, it is theorised that interaction-related and contributor-related
conditions show a substitutive relationship. This study provided a methodological contribution by
confirming the relevance of studying interrelationships within this field. The results provide an avenue for
future research through the suggestion that there is an interplay between contributor-related and
interaction-related factors. The findings have several practical implications for crowdsourcing organisers

TUMOUR-MEDIATED SIGNALLING TARGETING ADIPOCYTE TRANSFORMATION INTO CANCER-ASSOCIATED ADIPOCYTES IN OBESITY,"['Veldman, Birgit']","['Kalkhoven, E.']",2023-02-23T01:00:52Z,EN,['Cancer-associated adipocytes; obesity; cancer; paracrine signalling; adipocyte differentiation; adipocyte dedifferentiation'],Toxicology and Environmental Health,"Adipose tissue is suggested to affect tumourigenesis and cancer progression. A special type of peritumoural adipocytes, the cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs), may drive this cancer progression. However, the mechanisms underlying the tumour-mediated development of these CAAs remains largely unknown. Therefore, this study aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge, using Pubmed as database, regarding the mechanisms driving CAA development in obesity. 
CAAs are very heterogenic, and heterogeneity may be explained by several theories, including the heterogenetic nature of resident adipocytes, the distance of the adipocytes relative to the tumour, the differences in adipocyte precursor pools, and the transdifferentiation of peritumoural cell types. CAAs have previously been proposed to be in metabolic symbiosis with cancer cells, however, here we propose that cancer cells act as metabolic parasites on CAAs, resulting in the metabolic depletion of CAAs and trans-differentiation into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Furthermore, adipocyte differentiation and dedifferentiation mechanisms are highlighted, as a paradox seems to exist in which both seem to occur in fat tissue in cancer. The simultaneous differentiation and dedifferentiation process can be explained by spatial differences to the tumour core and the biphasic epigenetic regulation observed in adipocyte development, yet further studies are needed to confirm this. As for the tumour-mediated signalling mechanisms, EVs, including exosomes, seem to play a pivotal role in crosstalk and metabolic symbiosis between cancer cells and adipocytes. Furthermore, an important role for exomiR-155 is laid-out, regarding its role in activating both adipocytes and fibroblasts, promote adipocyte-browning and induce catabolism to promote cancer metastasis (96). Furthermore, specific miRNAs are associated with pro-tumorigenic processes, these miRNAs include miRNA-155, miRNA-126 and miRNA-144. Lastly, obesity worsens the TME by increasing inflammation and hypoxia, stimulating both hypoxia- and inflammation-induced adipocyte differentiation and tumour progression."
Automating the Ingredients Ordering Process in Restaurants: A Machine Learning-Powered System Approach,"['Hsieh, Sunny']","['Bodlaender, Hans']",2023-02-21T01:00:53Z,EN,['Machine learning; Automated systems; Restaurant ingredients automatization; AI'],Artificial Intelligence,"In this research, we aimed to automate the ingredients ordering process in restaurants. By labeling and analyzing a subset of dishes from an Indian restaurant's menu based in London, we were able to accurately predict the quantities of ingredients needed in a given time period. This has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of the ingredients ordering process, reducing the need for manual tracking and ordering and potentially reducing waste. We designed a pipeline consisting of three machine learning components, a detector, a determinator, a promoter, and a reducer. The machine learning components predict the total ingredients needed for different time frames, and the detector and determinator prevent overstock and understock, respectively. The promoter suggests possible actions in the event of overstock, and the reducer produces a preliminary order. Linear programming techniques could be used to finalize the order if constraints are present. The machine learning components were evaluated using the R squared score, and all three had a very high accuracy. The overall performance of the pipeline was evaluated using three custom metrics, which showed excellent results. This demonstrates that it is possible to automate the ingredients ordering process, even for small, non-franchised restaurants. While our study focused on a specific restaurant, the algorithm may also be applicable to other food service organizations, such as supermarkets and fast food chains. However, further research is needed to fully evaluate its performance in a wider range of settings."

These are called socio-scientific issues (SSIs) (Kolstø, 2001; Sadler & Zeidler, 2005a). Being able to form opinions and make decisions about these issues is one of the goals of scientific literacy and citizenship education (Kolstø, 2001; Sadler, 2004b; Sadler, 2011; SLO, 2021b). However, there is a lack of learning materials on SSIs involving computer science and technology (Knippels & van Harskamp, 2018; Vakil, 2020). Engagement and initial opinion-forming about SSIs can be achieved using narratives (Boerwinkel, 2012). The aim of this study is to design and evaluate the potential of narratives to introduce computer technology-related SSIs to lower secondary school students. Six narratives were developed and tested through eleven semi-structured, individual interviews and three semi-structured, focus group interviews with 9th grade students at pre-university level. Of these six narratives, two narratives were most successful in evoking values, emotions, reasoning and questions in students. These could be selected for further research and development into learning materials to implement computer science SSIs into education."

However, this also renders it vulnerable to adverse experiences and lack of critical inputs during critical periods of development. Specifically, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may be affected by experience-dependent developmental changes, because of its protracted maturational period and its involvement in complex tasks. Recently, perisomatic inhibition has been implicated in the effects of social play deprivation on PFC development. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are one of the main contributors to perisomatic inhibition. I therefore ask here, how different experiences affect the development of PV interneurons in the rodent PFC, and to what extent does the developmental stage influence the outcomes. I report evidence that prenatal stress, maternal separation, adolescent and adult stress, social isolation, immune activation, oxidative stress, environmental enrichment, and possibly early life sleep disruption affect the PV interneuron subpopulation in the PFC. I also discuss several physiological processes that may be involved. Outcomes are indeed dependent on developmental stage, and with more research the temporal and spatial profile of critical and sensitive periods may be elucidated."

AI software can reportedly reduce bias when hiring for a job opening, but new research suggests that this is not the case. Biases for agentic or communal traits are shown to have an effect on the outcome of hireability, which may influence hiring decisions. The current study aims to incorporate AI software output into organisational psychological research. This is achieved by emulating AI resumes as shown to recruiters. It was expected that overall, there would be a preference for agentic over communal applicants. In addition, other variables would be included as the gender of the candidate was likely to moderate this relationship, whereas perceived person-job fit by the recruiter was likely to partially mediate this relationship. In total, the scores of a group of 123 participants was analysed. In addition, the scores for a select group of 46 were also analysed separately, due to differences in the scores on the manipulation check. Results showed no effect of agentic or communal traits on hireability. Results also showed no interaction effect of the gender of the candidate on the relation between traits and hireability. A partial mediation effect of person-job fit on perceived traits and hireability was found. In terms of practical application, it is important for hiring managers to be aware of the possible bias that may persist, even when using ‘bias reducing’ AI software."
Assessment and mitigation of the risk of transformation products in drinking water,"['Hoencamp, Remi']","['Dingemans, Milou']",2023-02-24T01:00:50Z,EN,['Tiered risk assessment; Transformation products; Pesticides; Water quality; Guidelines; Livestock'],Toxicology and Environmental Health,"Toxicological risk assessment is an important tool to ensure the quality of our drinking water.
Pesticides that are widely used in agriculture are especially of concern as they leach into surface- and
groundwater which is used for the production of drinking water. An additional problem is the
transformation of the active substances of pesticides during the water treatment process. This
transformation may lead to exposures to newly formed transformation products that are not
considered in conventional risk assessments.
In this research, a literature study provides an overview of tiered risk assessments that give an insight
on how to assess human and animal health risks of transformation products. In addition, methods to
derive water quality guidelines for humans and livestock are investigated as these guidelines can help
to reduce the exposure to toxic chemicals. The specific focus was on guidelines for livestock, because
there are no official regulations for drinking water quality for livestock as there are for humans.
As a result, five main methods have been identified that are used in tiered risk assessments for
pesticide products, namely: toxicity testing, threshold of toxicological concern (TTC), quantitative
structure-activity relationship (QSAR), hazard quotient (HQ) and species sensitivity distribution (SSD).
For the derivation of water quality guidelines two main methods are identified. The tolerable daily
intake (TDI) approach (for humans and livestock) and the TTC approach (only for humans).
For the assessment of transformation products seemed the TTC approach and the use of QSARs most
suitable as they are relatively simple methods that do not need toxicity data. When a chemical is
identified as a risk, establishing drinking water quality guideline values can help to mitigate the risk for
both humans and animals."

MiRNAs play a role in many biological processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. Consequently, tightly regulated miRNA expression is important in organogenesis, whereas dysregulation is related to various diseases, including cancer. In Wilms tumor, the most common form of pediatric kidney cancer, differences in miRNA profiles between the blastemal and recessive subtypes are found. In addition, mutations in miRNA biogenesis genes, DROSHA, DGCR8 and DICER1, are found in Wilms tumors. Patients with Perlman syndrome, who show increased susceptibility to Wilms tumor formation, harbor biallelic mutations in DIS3L2. DIS3L2 is an exoribonuclease involved in miRNA degradation, specifically important in the DIS3L2-LIN28-let-7 pathway. Besides, recently germline as well as somatic second hit mutations in DIS3L2 were found in a higher-than-expected number of sporadic Wilms tumors. These findings suggest an important role of miRNA processing enzymes in Wilms carcinogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the correlation between various subtypes of Wilms tumors, focusing on exploring the similarities in Wilms tumor development in patients carrying mutations in general miRNA processing genes, DROSHA, DGCR8 and DICER1, compared to mutations DIS3L2. Current identified germline and somatic mutations in Wilms tumor patients are described, and their effect on miRNA levels and tumorigenesis is investigated. Overall, mutations in all investigated genes resulted in increased cell proliferation in vitro, which is an important cancer characteristic. Wilms tumor harboring mutations in general miRNA processing genes showed decreased mature miRNA expression, whereas the effect of mutations in DIS3L2 on miRNA levels is less well understood. Multiple studies have identified Wilms tumor patients carrying germline DIS3L2 as well as second somatic hit mutations, implying DIS3L2 to be a Wilms tumor predisposition gene. However, studies investigating the role of specific DIS3L2 mutations on aberrant miRNA levels and Wilms tumorigenesis are warranted to strengthen this statement. Ultimately, the identification of specific miRNAs disturbed in Wilms tumors, potentially let-7, can serve as prognostic markers as well as novel therapeutic options."
The Effects of tDCS and rTMS on Somatosensory Function and Recovery after Stroke and Central Post Stroke Pain: A Review,"['Innemee, Mira']","['Dijkerman, Chris']",2023-03-10T01:00:59Z,EN,[],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Following stroke, somatosensory impairments are frequently seen. This is associated with impaired motor function, and pain disorders following stroke, such as central post stroke pain (CPSP). Treatment of both somatosensory impairments as well as CPSP remains a challenge. Emerging treatments are non-invasive brain stimulation methods such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This review aims to evaluate the effects of tDCS and rTMS on 1) somatosensory function and recovery after stroke, and 2) pain relief in patients with CPSP. PubMed and Google Scholar were searched thoroughly, and eventually 20 studies were included. 7 studies in which the effect of tDCS or rTMS on somatosensory function in stroke patients was investigated, and 13 studies in which the effect of tDCS or rTMS on pain relief in patients with CPSP was investigated were analyzed. The results of the included studies suggest a positive effect of tDCS and rTMS on both somatosensory function and recovery after stroke, as well as pain relief in patients with CPSP at least in the short-term. More studies with a sufficient follow-up are needed to determine the long-term effect of both rTMS and tDCS on somatosensory recovery.

The history of the term translanguaging, how it can be used as a pedagogical practise in second language education, and its reception among educators will be discussed first. Throughout this thesis, the definition of PTL by Otheguy et al. (2015) will be used, namely “the deployment of a speaker’s full linguistic repertoire without regard for watchful adherence to the socially and politically defined boundaries of named (and usually national and state) languages” (p. 283). Moreover, throughout the thesis, a strict protocol was followed to reduce reviewer bias and promote replicability. Thus, selection criteria, a critical appraisal, and codes were used to searchfor, select, and analyse articles, which resulted in a total of four articles that matched all criteria. The main findings of these four studies were meshed and linked to information from the theoretical background in the form of a configurative synthesis as part of the discussion. The thesis will conclude by reviewing the results of PTL on the four language learning 
domains (i.e., constructive, cognitive, affective, and interactive) of ESL learners. Moreover, based on these overall findings, recommendations will be made for successfully implementing PTL in the Dutch ESL-context. Lastly, the limitations of the current thesis will be discussed and suggestions for future research will be given."

By researching how Extinction Rebellion makes use performance in and as protest, this thesis aims to respond to this call and contribute to theoretical knowledge on the use of performance in activism.
Extinction Rebellion is a globally active environmental artivist group that rebels against the dying of our Earth, which they believe to be caused by the capitalist system, and aims to move towards a new regenerative culture. With their performance in and as protest, they aim to advocate for social change. A dramaturgical analysis of two protests held during the London Fashion Week 2019 in this thesis, shows how Extinction Rebellion's use of artivist and theatrical strategies and tactics allow them to attempt to reveal the hegemonic system of climate crimes and the creation of a space that invites their spectators to imagine other ways of living and dying with our Earth."
Diversity matters,"['Derks, Valerie']","['Doorman, L.M.']",2023-03-10T01:00:51Z,EN,['diversity; STEM-field; sense of belonging; mathematics; textbook analysis; secondary school students'],Science Education and Communication,"In the Netherlands, the first choice girls make towards, or away from, the STEM-field is the choice between humanities focused mathematics and natural sciences focused mathematics in lower secondary education. Girls mostly decide towards humanities focused mathematics, while natural sciences focused mathematics is mandatory for most STEM-studies. As this choice is likely influenced by the lack of diversity in their mathematics textbooks and their sense of belonging towards the STEM-field, these aspects are studied. This research aims to find out which factors influence girls’ mathematics choice and their sense of belonging towards the STEM-field. This is done by analysing the diversity in mathematics textbooks and by interviewing girls about their mathematics choice and their sense of belong towards the STEM-field.
The textbook analysis shows a clear lack of diversity in the textbooks. White men are overrepresented, except in the ‘supportive’ questions. The ‘supportive’ questions are the only part of the books in which women are more present than men. When looking at individuals who represent the STEM-field, white men are overrepresented even more strongly. The interview results indicate the teachers have a big influence on the girls’ mathematics choice and the girls have very stereotypical views of the STEM-field.
The lack of diversity in the textbooks and the girls’ stereotypical views have a big impact on their sense of belonging. In turn, their sense of belonging and their teachers have an influence on their mathematics choice. This choice can already steer girls away from the STEM-field at 15 years old."

Een ecokritische lezing van de verbeelding van plaats, identiteit en landschap in de Friestalige poëzie van Obe Postma","['Schuurmans, Rymke']","['Sonnenschein, Johan']",2023-03-30T00:00:30Z,NL,"['Ecokritiek, Friese poëzie, minderheidsliteratuur, regionale literatuur, klimaatfilosofie, plaatsverbondenheid, de plattelandsidylle']",Nederlandse Literatuur en Cultuur,"Sinds enkele jaren spreken Friezen van ‘lânskipspine’ bij het aanzien van hun landschap dat 
door de intensieve veeteelt steeds meer is veranderd in een monocultuur. Het gaat niet alleen 
om een ecologische pijn, maar ook om een cultuurhistorische: het landschap wordt gezien als 
een onderdeel van de Friese identiteit. In deze scriptie wordt dit verband tussen ecologisch en 
cultuurhistorisch bewustzijn vanuit een ecokritisch perspectief onderzocht in de poëzie van 
Frieslands meest canonieke dichter: Obe Postma (1868-1963). Postma dichtte zijn hele leven 
over het Friese landschap en zijn poëzie beschouw ik daarom als een ‘poëzie van plaats’. Aan 
de hand van dit idee van plaats breng ik in deze scriptie inzichten uit de ecokritiek samen met 
onderzoek naar Friese cultuur. Plaatsverbondenheid werd in de vroege ecokritiek sterk 
gewaardeerd, omdat de lokale betrokkenheid en kennis van een plaats tot een ecologisch
bewustzijn zou leiden en een verlangen om de natuurlijke omgeving te beschermen. De 
verbeelding van plaats gaat vaak gepaard met de pastorale, waarbij het platteland wordt 
voorgesteld als een ‘natuurlijk’ toevluchtsoord weg van industrialisering en verstedelijking.
De pastorale speelt ook een belangrijke rol in de negentiende-eeuwse constructie van Friese 
cultuur als een authentieke en oeroude plattelandscultuur tegenover het verstedelijkte Holland. 
De verbeelding van ‘plaats’ en de ‘pastorale’ is later binnen de ecokritiek bekritiseerd omdat 
ze ecologisch bewustzijn en milieubewust handelen juist ook kunnen tegenwerken. Zo houden 
ze een statische en gesimplificeerde versie van de natuur in stand, verbloemen ze misstanden 
op het platteland en dragen ze bij aan nationalistische sentimenten. In de analyse onderzoek ik 
in hoeverre Postma’s poëzie een ecokritisch potentieel laat zien dan wel meer beantwoordt 
aan conservatieve uitwerkingen. Ik concludeer dat Postma’s poëzie als een vorm van protoecologische poëzie beschouwd kan worden. Postma’s poëzie verwoordt een ecocentrisch 
perspectief doordat Postma in zijn gedichten dicht bij de grond gaat zitten en vanuit dit 
nederige perspectief alles om zich heen beschrijft en waarde toekent. Hij ziet zichzelf als 
onderdeel van een groter geheel, beschrijft de verbondenheid van mens en natuur en plaatst 
die verbinding in een groter tijdsbestek, waardoor zijn poëzie de tijdelijkheid van een enkel 
mensenleven overstijgt. Zijn poëzie berust echter te sterk op een pastorale verbeelding van 
Friesland en de natuur, waardoor zijn poëzie niet kritisch wordt. De Friese natuur wordt 
vereenvoudigd voorgesteld, als een vertrouwde plek, een thuis, waar de dichter naar terug kan 
keren voor troost. Hierdoor werkt zijn poëzie eerder koesterend dan uitdagend. Wanneer zijn 
idyllische Friesland door modernisering verloren dreigt te gaan, zoekt Postma zijn ultieme
uitvlucht in de al-ziel, waar alles wat hem behaagt bewaard kan blijven."
Alternative Point of View: Development of a Novel Task-Based fMRI Brain-Mapping Protocol for Deaf Epilepsy Patients,"['Rakitina, Dasha']","['Otte, Wim']",2023-03-28T00:00:46Z,EN,"['Epilepsy, prelingual deafness, pre-surgical brain mapping, language area localisation, functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion-weighted structural imaging.']",Medical Imaging,"About 30-40% of all epilepsies are drug-resistant and require alternative solutions. A subset of people has epilepsy as well as hearing impairments. Epilepsy surgery is considered an option only after a risks and benefits evaluation. This evaluation starts with functional brain mapping, where one of the popular and widely available neuroimaging techniques is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Unfortunately, current fMRI protocols for epilepsy patients strongly rely on audible communication, which is not an option when evaluating patients that have audible impairments or are deaf. Therefore, the current complexity of pre-surgical evaluation procedures leads to lower chances for non-hearing patients’ candidacy for epilepsy surgery. This proposal will address this challenge.

Previously conducted studies suggest that uncontrollable seizures have an effect on structural brain connectivity, which, in combination with differences in audible input processing, make it harder to obtain a reliable brain mapping. Therefore, this research proposes the (1) development of an alternative scanning protocol, suitable for deaf epilepsy patients. Additionally, to further investigate inter-patient neuroplasticity in deaf individuals, we aim to recruit healthy deaf volunteers to perform functional task-based and resting state scans via a 7 T MRI scanner. As a result, (2) a dataset of high-resolution will become a groundwork upon which we can develop a better understanding of pathologies in deaf patients. Moreover, obtained data will be used to (3) critically revisit previously proven functional regions of the brain, employing newer and updated connectome mapping tools, like diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)."

Thus, the present study investigated the relationship between perceived discrimination and depression among young bicultural adults and the moderating role of coping styles on this relationship. More specifically, it was investigated whether a certain coping style (problem-focused vs emotion-focused vs avoidant coping) can mitigate the impact of discrimination on depressive symptoms to identify potential protective factors. The online survey was completed by 68 bicultural individuals with a mean age of 26.18 years (SD = 3.94), and included multiple questionnaires designed to measure individuals’ levels of depression, perceived discrimination, and coping strategies. The study revealed that perceived discrimination was positively correlated with symptoms of depression among bicultural individuals. Moreover, avoidant coping was significantly related to depressive symptoms, suggesting a linkage between avoidance coping and depression. Further research and clinical practice should thus, focus on how to strengthen and promote bicultural people’s skills to employ problem-focused coping strategies as this might be beneficial to reduce, and ultimately prevent depression in the face of discriminatory stress among a bicultural population."

The lower the response conflict the less self-control is needed and the happier and healthier people are. Practicing mindfulness has beneficial effects on reducing response conflict. However, in modern, fast-paced lives, time is precious and people do not have time for extended mindfulness exercises. Therefore, this study examined if a brief, single mindfulness exercise would be an effective tool to avoid making unhealthy food choices and, if so, which components of mindfulness – present-moment awareness, acceptance and decentering – would contribute to the effect. The study is an experimental cross-sectional design offered online. It included 86 participants, who were randomly assigned to either a 10-minute mindfulness or history audio. After the audio, participants were shown unhealthy food images and were asked to rate their conflicts towards them. In contrast to expectations, no direct or mediating effects were found between a mindfulness exercise and response conflict about unhealthy food. The small sample size and, therefore also, the lenient exclusion criteria could explain the lack of significant results in the study. Moreover, the strong correlation found between present-moment awareness and acceptance, provokes further investigation about the use of components. This study suggests that the state mindfulness components relevant for response conflict are not obvious, and that further research with a larger sample size is needed to draw more concrete conclusions."

A sample of 120 participants (Mage = 23.24, SD = 3.43, range = 19-42, 63.3% female) was obtained by means of a cross-sectional online survey. In line with the hypotheses, each rumination and perceived social support mediated the relationship between attachment domains and depressive symptoms. The mediation including rumination was stronger for individuals high in attachment anxiety, while the mediation including perceived social support was stronger for individuals high in attachment avoidance. Contrary to expectations, results indicated no sequential mediation for individuals high in attachment anxiety, but a weak sequential mediation for individuals high in attachment avoidance. Therefore, findings demonstrated distinct differences between attachment domains, presenting implications for future research and possibly informing more targeted intervention efforts."

Cancer dependencies are often selective for subtypes of cancers, and are measured as conditional changes in fitness caused by genomic and molecular aberrations and are known as genetic interactions (GIs). However, cancer dependencies can be influenced by several factors, resulting in higher-order GIs, which are difficult to predict for any given cancer type. This has resulted in a varied success rate for the development and application of new targeted therapies. In order to systematically identify cancer dependencies and GIs, genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out (KO) screens across pan-cancer libraries have been performed. Due to the limitations of large-scale screenings with multiple KOs, advanced computational strategies have to be used for inferring higher-order interactions and predicting cancer dependencies based on the molecular characteristics of the cancer cells.

In this study, we show a robust method to infer GIs from pan-cancer CRISPR screens based on the genetic and transcriptional background of the cancer cells. Pairwise GIs were inferred by predicting fitness change from CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene deletion using multivariate penalised linear regression, combined with null-hypothesis testing. Furthermore, we developed an XGBoost approach, where regression tree structures were mined for variable interactions, to discover potential complex higher-order interactions from transcriptional changes between cancer cells. Novel GIs were subsequently mapped and analysed in a genome-wide GI network.

In conclusion, our study shows a robust framework for predicting complex GIs involved in the regulation of cancer fitness."

PROs contain valuable information that a doctor cannot easily observe, such as symptoms experienced in day-to-day life. However, clinicians face a difficulty to use the format of PROs, typically gathered via a questionnaire, preferring to interact with patients directly. Consequently, clinicians appear repeating questions already gathered in the PRO data, while patients experience their detailed PRO reporting as a time-wasting activity. Existing attempts at improving the format of PROs have not focused on creating a solution that meets the time requirements of clinicians. This study aims to learn how to improve the format of PROs by means of visualization, so PROs can be effectively integrated in clinician workflows. To achieve such integration, this study followed the nine-stage “design study” methodology, where visualization researchers directly investigate a real-world problem in a target domain, design a validated visualization solution for it, and reflect on lessons learned to refine guidelines. This study was thus conducted at a pediatric rheumatology department of a Dutch hospital. Fly-on-the-wall observation of a pediatric rheumatologist followed by a semi-structured interview indicated that clinicians need a quick overview of the progression of PRO results of an individual patient over time while comparing these results to medication changes. Interviews of four patients indicated that patients need their doctors during their meeting to show that they understood and remember their PRO data well to the extent that they pose relevant rather than repetitive questions.  Based on those observations, PROVis was developed, a visualization system that supports the clinicians in quickly learning the most important PRO data in a narrative summary and allowing for identified attributes to be plotted over time through line graphs. The visualization system is centered around hospital visit dates, clearly illustrating whether the patient filled in their questionnaire for each visit. PROVis has been evaluated with four pediatric rheumatologists and a nurse. A thematic analysis of the evaluation has shown that PROVis allows clinicians to get a quick grasp of the PRO results as well as an understanding of the chronology of the PRO data. Future renditions of PROVis should include comparisons of PRO data with clinician observations. The results of this study stress the importance of visualizations for clinicians taking the limited time available during clinics into account. Visualizations of PRO data should further illustrate the results over time, while also allowing comparisons with the changes in medication and the measurements of the clinicians."

In dit onderzoek heb ik interviews afgenomen met elf Hilversumse gastgezinnen, Gemeente Hilversum en drie andere Nederlandse gemeenten. Ook heb ik mailcontact en telefonisch contact gehad met twee Nederlandse gemeenten en landelijke organisaties die betrokken zijn bij de opvang van vluchtelingen uit Oekraïne. Verder heb ik relevante gemeentelijke en landelijke documenten doorgenomen, een functionele analyse uitgevoerd op een brief van de gemeente en bij zes van de elf gastgezinnen een hardopdenkmethode toegepast. 		
Uit de analyse van de interviewtranscripties blijkt dat Gemeente Hilversum met gastgezinnen voornamelijk informerend communiceert met weinig interactieve communicatiemiddelen (zoals een face-to-face gesprek of een groepsbijeenkomst). Gastgezinnen blijken over het algemeen ontevreden te zijn over de communicatie vanuit de gemeente. Ze vinden dat de gemeente inefficiënt communiceert en spreken van een gebrek aan communicatie. Gastgezinnen voelen zich een vergeten groep.							
De communicatiebehoefte van gastgezinnen verschilt per onderwerp, zo blijkt uit de interviews met deze gastgezinnen. Voor veel onderwerpen (bijvoorbeeld kinderopvang of beleid) zijn informerende communicatiemiddelen zoals een brief of de website voldoende. Echter, gastgezinnen hebben soms behoefte aan communicatie die verder gaat dan ‘ervan weten’. Als er urgente zaken spelen (bijvoorbeeld ruzie met gasten), dan willen gastgezinnen een contactpersoon bij de gemeente kunnen bellen. Deze behoefte leeft bij elke deelnemer.		
In de interviews gaven gastgezinnen aan zich nauwelijks verbonden te voelen met de gemeente. Hier hebben gastgezinnen ook niet per se behoefte aan. Wel geven gastgezinnen aan dat er communicatieve factoren zijn die verbondenheid tussen de gemeente en gastgezinnen kunnen stimuleren. Op basis van de input uit de interviews met gastgezinnen heb ik een welkomstbrief aan gastgezinnen opgesteld. Deze kan de gemeente versturen zodra een gastgezin bekend is bij de gemeente. De brief heb ik voorgelegd aan zes gastgezinnen. Alle zes uitten zich positief over de brief en beoordeelden deze als bijdragende factor om een gevoel van verbondenheid met de gemeente te stimuleren.

to re-examine the way they do business. Numerous companies barely finished catching up with the third 
revolution that dealt with digitising their company. The Dutch government recognised the problems in
taking the next step towards digitalisation especially within the SME manufacturing industry. As 
digitalisation is an intricate process, the mechanisms and characteristics that enable digitalisation 
needed to be researched. A comprehensive model to identify barriers and offer potential solutions to 
lagging digitalisation in the SME manufacturing industry is currently missing in the literature. This gap
in the literature led this research to the following research question: “What strategies can SMEs in the 
manufacturing industry use to overcome barriers to digitalisation, creating a digital enterprise and thus 
increasing their competitiveness?”. To visualise how all conceptual elements coexist together, a 
conceptual model was created after an extensive literature study. This model was tested by conducting 
qualitative interviews with a wide range of companies in the Dutch SME manufacturing industry. The 
respondents shared the same pronounced views on what barriers were most troublesome. At a micro 
level, compatibility challenges prevent linking the factory floor with ERP software. The barrier at meso 
level is the fact that the digitalisation level of companies within a supply chain can differ immensely, 
so the degree of possible collaboration is limited. The macro level barrier concerns the lack of 
standardisation in the industry. This last barrier is the solution in itself. When all companies in a supply 
chain can use the same database structure or are able to link it easily with their own software, sharing 
data will become effortless. Using standardisation for machinery software will also prevent the resource 
investment of custom software development. Policy makers, education institutes and company 
executives and managers must keep this conceptual model as their guideline as they aim towards 
optimising digitalisation. Using this conceptual model can identify weak points within a company’s 
digitalisation efforts. Companies can actively cope with these weak points and thus become a more 
digital enterprise. Future research can test the impact of using the conceptual model and its subsequent 
effect on digitalisation across the supply chain within SMEs in the manufacturing industry. Applying 
the model in other industries or company sizes might also offer different results and solutions that could 
help advance the discussion and creation of theory."

Terwijl optimale patiëntinformatie juist essentieel is tijdens een opname, behandeling of operatie van een patiënt. Er wordt optimaal gebruik gemaakt van het schriftelijk voorlichtingsmateriaal als het materiaal op het goede moment aan de patiënt wordt uitgereikt, als het gemakkelijk te lezen is, als het begrijpelijk wordt geformuleerd, als het actueel is en als het overeenkomt met het kennisniveau dat de patiënt op het moment van lezen heeft.

"Collaboration for local food systems: The role of government in supporting and fostering conditions for successful local food system collaboration in Dublin, Ireland","['Nolan, Sarah']","['Runhaar, Hens']",2023-02-25T01:01:07Z,EN,['Local food systems; Sustainable food systems; Collaboration; Governance; Government.'],Sustainable Development,"It is becoming increasingly evident that conventional food systems driven by industrial agriculture for global supply chains are inherently unsustainable. Local food systems (LFS) have been identified as a promising and more sustainable alternative, in which food is produced, processed and retailed within a specific geographical boundary. Literature illustrates that LFSs are dependent on collaboration between relevant actors as a means of sharing knowledge, resources and collectively building resilient trust-based pathways outside of the conventional food system. Examples from literature also highlight how governmental support can enhance and improve LFSs. However, there is a lack of understanding of what makes collaborations successful in the context of LFS, and how the role of government influences such collaboration. 
This study aimed to address this knowledge gap by conducting a case study analysis in the LFS of Dublin, Ireland. A novel theoretical framework was derived from literature to elucidate success conditions for collaboration in LFSs and how such conditions may be influenced by government. This framework argued that successful collaboration is indicated by the presence of collaborative processes, which are influenced by exogenous conditions and the role of government. This study tested this theoretical framework through a case study analysis in Dublin’s LFS by first identifying relevant actors and how they collaborate. Interviews were then conducted and assessed using qualitative interpretative analysis techniques to understand the relationships between the central concepts. The results indicated that collaboration is unsuccessful in Dublin’s LFS, and this is heavily influenced by governmental (in)action. Although actors are willing to collaborate, they feel unsupported in this niche sector and are thus incapable of collaborating effectively due to resource and capacity constraints. Findings show that the success conditions for collaboration are applicable in understanding LFS collaborative dynamics and how they are shaped by government. Further research is needed to test these relationships by evaluating each condition in-depth, over time or in varying LFS contexts."
Finding freedom in sounds and steps: employing choreomusicology as a dramaturgical tool,"['Burg, Lisa van den']","['Karreman, L.L.']",2023-02-25T01:00:50Z,EN,['Dance; Movement; Music; Sound; Dramaturgy; Meaning-making; Dramaturgical analysis; Choreomusical analysis; Choreomusicology; Political'],"Contemporary Theatre, Dance and Dramaturgy","A meeting of music, movement, and meaning-making

This thesis demonstrates how ideas about the body as a site of political struggle are embedded in choreomusical relationships. Choreomusicology, a term that is coined by musicologist Paul Hodgins in 1992, is a contraction of the terms choreography and musicology and describes the connection between the two disciplines of dance and music in the performance field. This term addresses both a discourse on the relation between dance and music and a framework for choreomusical analysis. Drawing from analytical methods on choreomusical relationships proposed by Hodgins and dance scholar Stephanie Jordan, in this thesis I create a framework that addresses intrinsic and extrinsic relationships, music visualization, and rhythmic counterpoint. Subsequently, working with this framework, I combine choreomusical analysis with dramaturgical analysis, looking at how new meaning emerges in the encounter between music and dance. Drawing on theatre scholars Joe Kelleher and Colette Conroy’s theory on politics in theatre studies and the body as a site of power, I demonstrate on basis of the self-established themes of the body in relation, the body struggling, and the body in submission how choreomusical relations can carry political meaning. To specify, I explore how choreomusical relationships carry ideas about the body as a site of political struggle. Choreomusicology as a method is hardly used in the field of dance studies, since most dance scholars today study dance from a more contextual approach. Conversely, dramaturgical analysis does not address the compositional aspect of a performance in as much detail as choreomusical analysis. Therefore, by bringing these two methods of analysis together in analysing the contemporary dance performance any attempt will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones by Jan Martens, I aim to contribute to a deepening of both approaches. By looking at the cooperation and distribution of power of choreomusical relationships from a relational political point of view, this performance shows that the dramaturgical message of any attempt will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones is grounded in detailed layers of composition. Consequently, based on the results of both choreomusical and dramaturgical analysis, I argue that ideas about the body as a site of political struggle are embedded in choreomusical relationships in any attempt will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones by Jan Martens."
Catching targeting factors involved in co-translational import into mitochondria,"['Engel, Anna']","['Förster, Friedrich']",2023-02-28T00:00:36Z,EN,[],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Cells within multicellular organisms have different compartments called organelles. One of these 
organelles is the mitochondrium, which provides the cell with the energy required to perform its 
functions. Most of the proteins within the mitochondria are brought there after they are synthesized
by a molecular machine called the ribosome. This synthesis process is called translation. However, 
sometimes the proteins are also brought to the mitochondria while being translated, which is called 
co-translational targeting. Until now, co-translational targeting to the mitochondria has not been 
studied that well. In the yeast S.cerevisiae, it has been found that the nascent polypeptide-associated 
complex (NAC) interacts with actively translating ribosomes called ribosome nascent-chain complexes 
(RNCs). It is unknown if NAC has the same functions in mammals as in yeast. Moreover, there is hardly 
any structural information on the interaction between NAC and RNCs. This thesis aimed to find 
targeting factors like NAC in mammalian and yeast systems.
For this aim, a system that can translate the proteins is needed. This system is called an in vitro 
translation system. Therefore, a yeast in vitro translation system was established and optimized in the 
lab. To generate the RNCs, model proteins were chosen. The DNA of these model proteins was 
supplemented with a sequence that halts the translation by the ribosome to allow for the generation 
of RNCs. In addition, it contains a sequence that allows for the purification of the RNCs. The model 
proteins were then translated in the yeast in vitro and in a previously established mammalian in vitro
translation system called rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). The RNCs and empty ribosomes were isolated 
from the in vitro translation mixtures and imaged using negative stain electron microscopy (EM), which 
Is a technique that allow us to look at small molecules that we can not see with our eye. With this 
method, we could determine the sample homogeneity. The RRL RNCs were, but the yeast RNCs were 
not homogenous. Moreover, purification of the RNCs was attempted; however, this was unsuccessful. 
Before we can find mitochondrial targeting factors, the purification of the RNCs needs to be optimized. 
When this is done, cryo-single particle analysis EM (cryo-SPA-EM) can be performed, which is a 
microscopy technique that allows us to look at molecules with higher detail than with negative stain 
EM. However, this also requires further optimization. Lastly, the newly established yeast in vitro 
translation system can be used for other applications such as research in other fields."

The lasting impact of highly resistant pioneer vegetation on the development of a scaled experimental salt marsh with multiple species in a tilting flume,"['Veerman, Thomas']","['Kleinhans, Maarten']",2023-03-18T01:01:15Z,EN,['salt marsh; biogeomorphic feedback; landscape scale; Metronome;'],Earth Surface and Water,"Landscape-scale experiments of erosive self-forming tidal basins were carried out in the Metronome tidal flume, to investigate biogeomorphic feedback in salt marshes. Live seeds of analog species were introduced into the flow at the tidal inlet to simulate real-world marsh plants. The present study is a follow-up on an earlier experiment, in which a single species (Lotus pedunculatus) was used. An assemblage of three species was selected, with differing physical properties, resulting in differences in resistance and resilience. The idea was that through feedbacks such as facilitation, different patterns of vegetation colonization would arise compared to the single-species experiment, which would also bring about morphological differences between the two systems. It was expected that more surface area would be colonized than in the single-species experiment, as the more resilient Medicago sativa (alfalfa) could act as a pioneer in areas with high flow velocities, and by its physical presence create conditions suitable for the other, less resistant and resilienct species (Lotus pedunculatus and Veronica beccabunga) to settle. Instead, the result for the multi-species experiment was a cover rate of only 2.5% against 8% in the single-species experiment. This disparity was attributed to the very rapid and localized colonization by Medicago, which modified flow patterns in a way that reduced the chances of seeds reaching intertidal areas from the tidal inlet. Typical flow velocities around the Medicago patch only slowly destroyed it. While local facilitation at the Medicago patch was observed, other areas remained relatively bare. On a system scale, there was no positive feedback for the vegetation. The results are not reflective of the natural state of salt marshes, and lessons learned mostly apply to future flume studies with live vegetation. Resistance and resilience must be scaled to flow conditions, such that vegetation is dynamic on a timescale relevant to the experiment. Similar conditions to the experiment could hypothetically occur in real salt marshes as a result of human interference, such as artificial planting of non-native species, to the detrement of long-term salt marsh survival."
"Exploring the link between the diversity of the potato microbiome and potato plant vitality
A contribution to the development of a prediction model for potato plant vitality according to its microbiome","['Kloe, Emma de']","['Berendsen, R.L.']",2023-03-18T01:01:29Z,EN,['plant-microbe interactions; microbiome; alpha diversity; beta diversity; potato; plant vitality'],Environmental Biology,"When considering changing agricultural practices for a sustainable future, potatoes would be a topic of importance as they are the world's fourth most important staple food. After observing varying levels of vitality of the same potato variety, it was hypothesised that the microbiome (the microbial community that lives with its host) of the plants could be responsible, as an optimal microbiome can contribute to plant vitality and fitness. This is why Utrecht University and its collaborating partners are working on a prediction model that could predict the potato plant’s vitality by looking at the microbiome of a batch of seed potatoes. This study hopes to contribute to this project by looking at the diversity of the potato microbiome. The diversity of the plant’s microbiome is suggested to be a key factor for good plant performance and can be influenced by various variables. Therefore, the vitality of six different potato varieties, two soil types and two harvest years were compared in relation to their respective microbial diversities. The statistical analysis was performed focussing on the bacterial data of microbiome species present in the eye compartment of the seed potato tuber. In this study, it was found that the different variables relate differently to the microbial diversity of the potato microbiome and potato plant vitality. Soil type showed no influence on the alpha diversity but it did show to influence the beta diversity greatly. The variety of the potato and its harvest year showed to influence both alpha and beta diversity (two ways to describe species diversity) of the tuber’s microbiome, though there was no link found between the alpha diversity of these variables and the potato plant vitality. Further research is necessary to find out what underlying factors are essential for high plant vitality in order to be able to develop the prediction model."
A 'mindful' transformation: A study on how heritage sites can transform into 'mindful' tourist experiences,"['Galen, Myrthe van']","['Zee, Egbert van der']",2023-03-18T01:01:21Z,EN,[],Human Geography,"Tourism is responsible for a lot negative external effects. Therefore the sector is looking for ways to counter these effects. One form of tourism which has gotten a lot of attention the last years is mindful tourism, which can be described as a way of travelling and getting to know other places and cultures in a way that is environmentally friendly and respectful to the local communities (Ling, Noor, Mustafa & Kiumarsi, 2019). As tourists after the pandemic are more likely to engage in more sustainable forms of tourism and are more aware of the negative externalities of the sector, more insights and tools on how destination managers and DMO's can create mindful tourism experiences are needed. 

The aim of this thesis is to provide insights into the mindful behavioural patterns of tourists. These insights will contribute to a better understanding on how to implement successful sustainable tourism policy and therefore play a significant role in the crucial shift towards a more sustainable form of tourism. This study will take place in Järvsö, a rural-tourist destination in Sweden, with the ambitious goal of becoming a global example of sustainable tourism. A special focus will be on a heritage centre Stenegård, since mindfulness-driven tourism activities are especially important for heritage sites as they are more vulnerable to extensive tourism growth (Moscardo, 1996)."
CMIP6 model performance in the Subpolar North Atlantic in relation to the AMOC,"['Giorgi, Erika']","['Bijl, Peter']",2023-03-17T01:01:18Z,EN,['CMIP6; AMOC; Subpolar North Atlantic; Climate Models'],Marine Sciences,"In a warming climate, it is necessary to understand how the ocean, a crucial component of the climate system, will react. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) transports heat, nutrients, and carbon, but is often not well represented in climate mod- els. Deep convection in the Subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA) influences the strength of this circulation and is an important feature to represent accurately in climate models for reli- able future projections. This thesis explores how the representation of circulation and hydrography impacts stratification and regions of deep convection in the SPNA for a range of CMIP6 models in comparison to CMEMS reanalysis. All of the models show temperature and salinity biases throughout the Labrador, Irminger, and Nordic Seas, influencing the stratification and location or depths of deep convection. These biases can be caused by an overestimation of sea ice concentration, especially in the Labrador Sea, or too high temperatures in the North Atlantic Current with a stronger AMOC compared to observations. Increasing ocean resolution is not found to improve these biases, and results in an overestimation of the mixed layer depth in the Labrador Sea. If these processes are not well represented in comparison to observations or reanalysis products, it may influence their validity for future AMOC and climate projections."

Improving the quality of antibiotic allergy registrations,"['Middelburg, Tara']","['Garde, E.M.W. van de']",2023-03-17T01:01:08Z,EN,['antibioticstewardship;intervention;antibioticallergy;registrations;quality'],Farmacie,"Background: Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide growing problem. One of the causes of this problem is incorrect documentation of antibiotic allergies by healthcare professionals. Up to 90% of the registrations turn out to be incorrect, leading to the unnecessary avoidance of certain antibiotics with serious consequences for both the patient and healthcare in general. To contribute to the improvement of the quality of antibiotic allergy registrations in different healthcare domains this study was set up. 
Methods: This study consisted of a point prevalence analysis of the completeness and degree of similarity of antibiotic allergy registrations between a tertiary care hospital and the patient’s community pharmacy. Hospitalized patients aged ≥ 18 with a registered or reported antibiotic allergy were eligible for the study. Information on the allergy label was collected from the patient’s electronic medical file in both the hospital and community pharmacy. The labels were checked for completeness and compared between the two healthcare systems. 
Results: 100 patients were included in the study, accounting for 134 antibiotic allergy labels in total. After performing an analysis of completeness, none of the labels in both the hospital or community pharmacy could be defined as complete. Comparison of the registrations showed that 34.3% (46/134) of the registrations could be defined as similar between the two healthcare systems. Moreover, 38.8% (52/134) of the registrations were only reported in one of the two systems. 
Conclusion: The quality of antibiotic allergy registrations is insufficient in both the hospital and community pharmacy. Furthermore, major dissimilarities have been found when comparing these registrations. Antibiotic stewardship interventions that improve the quality and similarity of the registrations are highly needed in both healthcare domains in order to prevent the unnecessary use of second-choice antibiotics."

It led to the transformation of a view of the soil as nutrient infrastructure to a soil as an entity with a story that has a beginning, middle and an end. The epistemic hierarchy between the lab and the field has furthermore greatly influenced Hissink’s approach in researching the soil as well as his decision on which kinds of soil knowledge to allow into his realm. This was the case for the laboratories that he worked at as well as the lab-field hybrid spaces where he performed experimentation. However, even though Hissink has tried to move away from localness of the soil to universal ideas, theories, and methods, those same unique, inherently local features of the Dutch landscape have kept influencing

De impact van een tijdelijke professional op een vrijwillige sportvereniging: Twee casestudies over de ervaren impact van Clubkadercoaching op middellange termijn,"['Braal, Robert']","['Slobbe, Michel van']",2023-04-14T00:00:52Z,EN,['Clubkadercoaching; impactstudie; vrijwillige sportvereniging; professionals'],Sportbeleid en sportmanagement,"Het inzetten van beroepskrachten op vrijwillig georganiseerde sportverenigingen wordt door steeds meer actoren in het Nederlandse sportlandschap, zoals NOC*NSF, sportbonden, het ministerie van VWS en gemeenten, gezien al een geschikt middel om deze verenigingen te versterken. Vaak gaat het hierbij over blijvende professionals op verengingen. Hier is ook regelmatig onderzoek naar gedaan. Deze onderzoeken tonen aan dat blijvende beroepskrachten impact hebben op het functioneren van vrijwillige verenigingen. Uit het onderzoek van Thibault et al. (1991) blijkt dat de meeste impact van professionals te herkennen is op sporttechnische gebieden in de analytische categorieën specialisatie en formalisatie. Er is echter geen onderzoek gedaan naar de inzet van tijdelijke beroepskrachten op verengingen, terwijl met de intrede van de Clubkadercoachinterventie in 2018 hier landelijk wel veel op ingezet wordt. Het is nog onbekend wat de impact is op middellange termijn van deze interventie die als doel heeft trainersbegeleiding binnen een bepaalde periode normaal te maken op verenigingen. Dit onderzoek gaat in op dit kennishiaat.
Dit gebeurt door de beantwoording van de onderzoeksvraag: ‘Welke impact ervaren kaderleden en professionals van de Clubkadercoachinterventie binnen sportverenigingen op middellange termijn (1,5-2 jaar)?’.  Deze vraag is beantwoord doormiddel van een interpretatief onderzoek bij twee casusverenigingen die deelgenomen hebben aan de pilot Clubkadercoaching van 2018 tot en met 2020. Bij deze twee verenigingen zijn interviews afgenomen met de betrokken kaderleden en Clubkadercoaches en zijn relevante documenten geanalyseerd. Aan de hand van de theoretische concepten specialisatie, formalisatie en centralisatie (Thibault et al., 1991) is de ervaren impact van de interventie geanalyseerd.
Uit deze analyse komt dat op beide voorbeeldverenigingen in alle drie de analytische categorieën kaderleden en professionals anderhalf jaar na de interventie, een blijvende impact toekennen aan de inzet van de Clubkadercoach, oftewel de beroepskracht. Trainersbegeleiding is op beide verenigingen genormaliseerd en een onderdeel van de verenigingsstructuur geworden, zoals beoogd door de beleidsmaker als resultaat van de interventie. 
De duurzaamheid van de interventie staat echter deels onder druk doordat de beroepskracht vaak wordt opgevolgd door een vrijwilliger. Bij vrijwillige opvolging neemt de specialistische kennis op het gebied van trainersbegeleiding af en heeft het onderzoek laten zien dat de kwetsbaarheid is op het gebied van eindverantwoordelijkheid en tijdsinvestering door de vrijwillige opvolger. Dus om een duurzame impact op een vereniging te creëren, dient de opvolging van een professionele Clubkadercoach dus een duidelijke aansturing en verantwoordelijkheid te hebben, in staat zijn genoeg tijdsinvestering te kunnen doen en minimaal net zoveel expertise te hebben als een professional."

Throughout cancer progression cells are affected by mechanical forces. Forces like tension, compression and shear of fluid flow can be generated and sensed by cells (mechanosensing), and can biochemically be transduced (mechanotransduction), leading to alterations in cellular fate and behavior. In tumors, changes can occur in how cells sense forces in the environment, or the environment can change. Tumor cells are affected by changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and mechanical strength, of which these changes can also be induced by the tumor itself or tumor-recruited stromal cells. Mechanical forces and sensing of them are involved in many steps of metastasis, from the local environment of the primary tumor, to dissemination through circulation, re-entry into tissues and colonization of secondary sites. In this review we discuss our current understanding of the contribution of mechanosensing and mechanotransduction at several steps of the metastatic cascade, including mechanical changes prior to colonization caused by cancer, various pathologies and aging."

In total, 659 participants participated in this online experimental study (34.4% Greek, 29.7% Turkish, 17% German and 11.7% Bulgarian). Participants were
randomly allocated to a vignette with one of three conditions (i.e., autonomy support, guilt induction low warmth, guilt-induction high warmth). Before and after reading the vignette, participants filled out the questionnaire. Results showed that guilt-induction predicted a higher level of need frustration, whereas autonomy support predicted less need frustration. Furthermore, the results showed no moderation of self-construal on the relations towards need frustration, which contradicts Markus and Kitayama’s model of self-construal. More research is needed to clarify these contradictions and to gain clear insights into the relations in the

Prognosis for eating disorders is currently not very good and self-disgust might play a part in this. Self-disgust leads to psychological suffering, which might lead to eating disorder symptoms. In current research, it was investigated if self-disgust is indeed associated with eating disorder symptoms, and if this process is mediated by psychological suffering. 
	Participants (N=84) were interviewed online with a survey consisting of the Questionnaire for the Assessment of Self-Disgust (QASD), the Kessler 10 (K10), the Disgust Propensity and Sensitivity Scale-Revised (DPSS-R), the Positive And Negative Affect Schedule Short Form (PANAS-SF) and the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). Two of these questionnaires were used as control variables. 
	The results showed that self-disgust positively associates with eating disorder symptoms, but that psychological suffering does not work as a mediator between this process. Negative affect was not associated with eating disorder symptoms. Disgust sensitivity and propensity were also not associated with eating disorder symptoms. 
	As was expected, a positive association was found between self disgust and eating disorder symptoms. A point of improvement is the recruiting of the research sample: After the first method of recruiting turned out to be insufficient, a convenience sample of the researcher’s own network was used. Other limitations were missing items in the K10 and DPSS-R, and the way the participants were recruited. It is concluded that self disgust positively associates with eating disorder symptoms, but is not mediated by psychological suffering. This means that self-disgust plays a large part in eating disorders and might be useful to address in therapeutic practice. For future research it is recommended to find out how self-disgust can best be implemented in therapy."

recent COVID-19 pandemic to enforce new measures to stop the virus from spreading. This 
study explored what effect coercion has on personal autonomy, as reflected in the sense of 
agency, by replicating parts of the experiments done by Caspar and colleagues. We expected 
that coercion would decrease the subjective experience of sense of agency. The experiment 
was conducted in an online environment where 42 participants performed a time interval 
estimation task. During the task, participants had the option to either financially harm another 
participant or to withdraw from harming. The participants were sometimes free and 
sometimes coerced into one of the two actions. After the action was selected the sense of 
agency was indexed by intentional binding. Contrasting our main hypothesis, we found no 
significant relationship between coercion and sense of agency. This would suggest that 
coercion has no effect on personal autonomy. Although no significant relationship has been 
found, when accounting for the limitations of this study, different results would be expected. 
Coercion might result in different experiences of agency when changed in setting, deliverance 
or degree. The current study serves as a starting point for the complex relationship between 
coercion and personal autonomy within a new digital environment. Future research could 
focus on improving the methodology of this study and explore with potential moderators, 
mediators and the operationalization of coercion."

Eimeria spp. can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, especially in young rabbits. Fewer studies have determined the prevalence of Passalurus ambiguus in rabbits. This nematode is generally thought to be non-pathogenic. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge about endoparasite infestations in rabbits in the Dutch pet industry. Therefore, this study investigated the prevalence of endoparasites, specifically Eimeria spp. and P. ambiguus, in rabbits from Dutch rabbit fanciers. Faecal samples from 191 Dutch show rabbits were tested by CSF and McMaster analysis, and a questionnaire was sent to the rabbit fanciers to assess risk factors. Eimeria spp. prevalence was found to be 84.3% and P. ambiguus prevalence was 26.7%. This is markedly higher than expected. Prevalence of Cestoda and Trichuris spp., in contrast, was low (0.5%). The implementation of quarantine measures by the rabbit fanciers when new rabbits are acquired was significantly associated with the presence of Eimeria spp. and P. ambiguus in the faeces, reducing the likelihood of either parasite being present. This indicates the importance of these measures in practice. The OPG (oocysts per gram of faeces) of Eimeria spp. was significantly higher if the rabbit fancier uses a cleaning agent when cleaning the rabbits’ cages. This finding requires additional research to confirm and explain the phenomenon."

Maar wat als klanten geen schade indienen? Op welke momenten kan een verzekeraar zich dan profileren? Verzekeraar Goedverzekert hield zich bezig met deze vragen. Zeker, omdat het product ‘aansprakelijkheidsverzekering’ (AVB) voor de zakelijke markt over drie maanden de overstap maakt naar een online funnel. Daarbij kan een AVB volledig online worden afgesloten, wat het klantcontact nog verder bemoeilijkt. Terwijl een AVB een van de meest verkochte verzekeringen is: ongeveer 35 duizend midden- en kleine bedrijven hebben een AVB bij Goedverzekert, waarvan bijna twee derde (21.720) een zzp’er is. Daarom is in dit onderzoek onderzocht hoe Goedverzekert de eerstejaarsklantreis van zzp’ers met een aansprakelijkheidsverzekering kan optimaliseren. Daarvoor zijn twee deelstudies uitgevoerd.

De resultaten van beide deelstudies hebben geleid tot een aantal aanbevelingen. Allereerst is het advies om minder informatie in het begin van de eerstejaarsklantreis te versturen, en informatie meer te verspreiden over het eerste jaar heen. Daarnaast zijn meer contactpunten met informatie over het verzekeringsproduct AVB gewenst. Bij voorkeur moeten deze extra contactpunten plaatsvinden via andere communicatiemiddelen dan de telefoon en e-mail. Bijvoorbeeld via een app of WhatsApp. Aangezien niet elke zzp’er meer informatie wil ontvangen over een AVB, raad ik aan om zzp’ers zelf te laten bepalen hoeveel informatie ze ontvangen. Dat kan bijvoorbeeld via een aan-uitknop voor het ontvangen van extra informatie in hun online account. Daarnaast is het advies om de inleiding van brieven of e-mails kort en bondig te maken. Ook raad ik aan om in de tekst van e-mails of brieven geen afkortingen te gebruiken. Het geven van voorbeelden is juist wel bevorderlijk voor het begrijpen van een tekst.

The Legacy for Adulthood of Parental Mental Illness,"['Benavides Jiménez, Gema']","['Bakuri, Amisah']",2023-02-14T01:01:00Z,,[],UCU Liberal Arts and Sciences,"The repercussions of growing up with a parent with mental health difficulties have
largely been underexplored in available academic literature. Therefore, this research
paper aims to highlight how once mental health problems erupt within the family, the
impact is not only felt by the patient but also by their intimate others. Through a literature
review and seven intensive interviews, this thesis explores the adult legacy of having a
parent with mental health difficulties in Spain. Results show that the repercussions of
having a parent with mental health difficulties are often difficult to label as either good
or bad but are rather situated in a spectrum. For example, while having an increased
independence and sense of maturity was often reported as a source of pride, there is also
the risk of taking too many responsibilities on their shoulders. However, despite having
difficulties, drawing boundaries and negotiating responsibilities, participants also
recognized that despite the challenges they have faced as they learned how to live with
parental mental illness, they all have managed to get something good/useful out of it.
Beyond the subjective impact that growing up with a mentally ill parent has had on my
participants, this thesis also aimed to portray these individuals as experts through
experiences, so my results also contain some of their criticism towards the health- care
system, suggestions for improvement and general recommendations for other individuals
living with a mentally ill parent."

In addition, this thesis uses various adaptations and translations of the Consolation of Philosophy from the Medieval period to compare the function of the dialogue form, and the use of personifications to the consolatory meaning of the text. Research on the Consolation of Philosophy has focussed on Lady Philosophy’s rational arguments, delineating a healing worldview to Boethius. This thesis explores other ways in which Lady Philosophy consoles Boethius, most importantly through indicating acceptable ways to behave and to engage with grief."
Small Nucleolar RNAs: Players in Human Development and Disease,"['Verstappen, Noud']","['Heesch, Sebastiaan van']",2023-02-15T01:00:57Z,EN,['non-coding RNA; snoRNAs; Development; Childhood cancer; Prader-Willi; Dyskeratosis congenita'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Throughout the late 20th century, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) were identified as a novel class of non-coding RNA. SnoRNAs comprise three main classes based on conserved sequence motifs: C/D box, H/ACA box and Cajal body-associated snoRNAs. Their canonical function is to provide specificity to discrete ribonucleoprotein complexes, which post-transcriptionally modify ribosomal RNAs and spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs. It has become increasingly clear that snoRNAs can adopt unexpected cellular functions, ranging from the regulation of chromatin states to cell-cell communication. In addition, snoRNAs are intimately involved in cellular programs critical to development, as revealed by studies from model organisms. In this writing assignment, the ever expanding repertoire of snoRNA biology will be reviewed with an ultimate focus on developmental disease."
Risk factors for canine leptospirosis in the Netherlands in the years 2015 through 2020,"['Spaander, Hannah']","['Overgaauw, P.A.M.']",2023-02-10T00:00:39Z,EN,[],Companion Animal Medicine,"Objective – To identify risk factors for canine leptospirosis in the Netherlands in the years 2015 through 2020 and to compare these risk factors to risk factors found in literature.
Design – Meta-analysis and data research
Material & Methods – Risk factors for canine leptospirosis in the years 2015 through 2020 were based on data of both negative and positive test results acquired from IDEXX Laboratories and Laboklin during this period (n = 2171). Explored risk factors were sex, age and regions based on postal codes. Logistic regression was used to define these risk factors. The risk factors of the literature were distracted through meta-analysis on cohort studies, case control studies and cross-sectional studies (n=22).
Results – Out of 2171 dogs, 504 had positive test results. Dogs under the age of one year old had a higher risk than older dogs (OR = 3.44, 95% CI =2.54-4.66). Dogs living in the western region of the Netherlands had a higher risk than dogs living in other regions of the Netherlands (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.01-2.05).
Twenty-two studies were used for the individual meta-analysis of thirteen risk factors, but no significant risk factors were found.
Conclusion – There was no significant evidence that domesticated dogs which are tested positive for leptospirosis in the Netherlands in the years 2015 through 2020 match the profile of risk factors described in the literature, such as gender and age."
"Recover, repair or restrict? - New therapeutic perspectives for MS patients","['Stok, Maaike']","['Hamann, Dorte']",2023-02-09T01:01:01Z,EN,[],Infection and Immunity,"Up until today, the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients relies on immune modulation.  A deeper understanding of MS pathogenesis has generated new perspectives on targeting the cause and consequences in the clinic. Therapies in this new generation can be roughly divided into three categories based on their mechanism of action: recovery, repair, and restriction. Recovering therapies focus on restoring balance in imbalanced systems, such as the immune system itself or the intestinal microbiota. Re-introducing balance leads to indirect amelioration of the autoreactive processes. Therapies inducing repair address the consequence of the intolerant immune response: damage to the central nervous system. Since this is associated with the development of symptoms, repair reduces MS-related impairments. Restricting therapies aim to prevent damage to neuronal fibers, thus preventing symptoms. 

In addition to the therapies focusing on a specific aspect of pathogenesis, the holistic approach to MS management has gained attention over the years. Specifically, lifestyle adaptations have been shown to be effective in multiple ways, including downregulation of the autoreactive response and neuronal protection. 

The new generation of MS therapies emphasizes the importance of a look beyond immune modulation. Counteracting the autoreactive response in a multifaceted way will more effectively inhibit disease progression."

After determining the frequencies of explicitation and implicitation, and reduction, expansion, and the same number of characters in a total of 2,364 instances, a crosstabulation of these strategies and length outcomes finds that although implicitation-based reduction accounts for 46.2% (i.e. 1,093) of all instances, nearly 10% of all instances (i.e. 234) can be attributed to explicitation-based reduction. Close analysis of these 234 instances identifies eight patterns, which are listed from most frequent to least frequent: (1) result-oriented translations, (2) overstatements, (3) reader-oriented translations, (4) increased probability, (5) eliminated idioms and expressions, (6) overt imperatives, (7) combined subtitles, and (8) desententialisation. Further research is needed to provide both qualitative and quantitative data on the occurrence of these patterns across different films, film genres, and language pairs."

KINSHIP VERIFICATION USING VISION TRANSFORMERS,"['Tang, Huaixi']","['Önal Ertugrul, I.']",2023-02-17T01:00:50Z,EN,"['Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Kinship Verification']",Artificial Intelligence,"Kinship verification is the term of verifying whether the given two people have a kin
relationship from their facial images or videos or other biological features. As a soft
bio-metric modality, visual kinship verification has high availability and extremely low
cost compared to DNA-based methods. It is a huge challenge to analyze kinship based on
visual information, mainly because the kin relationship has s large intra-class differences
and small inter-class differences due to factors such as gender and age. This requires us to
extract more discriminative features. Video data can bring us a new dimension. Previous
studies have shown that people with kinship not only have similar appearances but also
have similar expression patterns, which suggests that we can extract dynamic features of
facial videos for kinship verification. Traditional methods use handcraft features to extract
dynamic features, and some new research begins to use neural networks. Our research
focuses on smiling expressions, trying to extract spatio-temporal features from facial videos
using a state-of-the-art video vision transformers. We created a video vision transformer
based siamese network and trained it on a face video dataset. We experimentally compare
the impact of using dynamic features versus purely texture features on kinship verification.
We then compared the capabilities of CNNs and ViTs in extracting facial dynamic features.
We tested the performance of the model by adjusting the initialization and training methods

However, there have been several recent improvements in the quality of observational data. This means that we can no longer ignore the effects of luminous matter, that is to say baryons, on models of large-scale structure. We investigate a halo model of the universe which includes baryons, and see what their effects are on the matter power spectrum. Including baryons adds many free parameters to the model. We vary all the parameters to see which have the largest effect, and look for ways to constrain them. We do a Fisher forecast to explore the uncertainty on the most important of these. We show that adding priors from observational data helps mitigate the impact of the baryonic parameters."
Competing Logics from the CSO Perspective in a Partnership on Undocumented Migration with the State: A Case Study of Villa Vrede,"['Stormer, Roxane']","['Alakavuklar, Ozan']",2023-03-09T01:01:16Z,EN,['Institutional Logics; Competing Logics; CSSP; CSO; Undocumented Migration'],"Organisaties, verandering en management","The Dutch state, municipalities, and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) collaborate in a Cross-Sector Social Partnership (CSSP) to find long-lasting solutions to the problem of undocumented people in the Netherlands. Though they all wish for a sustainable solution, their goals, norms, and values differ, potentially affecting the collaboration. While literature in organizational studies lacks research on the perspective of CSOs in collaboration with the state in CSSPs, this research bridges that gap through the lens of institutional logics. It aims to understand how CSO members perceive such a partnership, if and where they perceive tension through competing logics, and which strategies they use to maneuver through them to sustain their activities to keep raising the flag for social justice. 
 	The case study contained ethnographic methodologies, such as participant observations and conducted interviews, and took place at Villa Vrede (VV), a CSO in this national collaboration in the Netherlands on undocumented migration. Data analysis occurred through thematic analysis. The findings show how dominantly state logics are perceived by CSO members and that strategies are chosen based on their perceived hierarchical position within the CSSP, acting with resourcefulness within the margins of their place of power in the partnership. For example, members use the strategy of defiance when this isn’t expected from the less powerful actor in the partnership. In line with the literature, members also use the strategy of avoidance, among other strategies. 
 	
This research contributes to the literature by showing that impact and change can happen in the margins by collaborating with and simultaneously avoiding the powerful partner(s). It shows how the state needs the operational services of CSOs, creating space for CSO members to negotiate, maneuver, and potentially push dominant and long-existing institutions back to open space for re-evaluation with a social justice perspective, thereby changing the CSSP landscape. In addition, it shows that CSO practices like VV can continue to raise awareness on social justice and might shift the collaboration in the long term in their favor by understanding and mapping out where their services are vital for more powerful partners in the CSSP. It can also help create a strategy and a more powerful position to negotiate the partnership's terms, conditions, and underlying values. This can encourage CSO members to – instead of trying to change the power imbalance – use strategies creatively by looking for alternative ways of exercising influence and creating change in CSSPs within their hierarchy."
Exploring user needs in news: shifting from writing for users to creating experiences for users,"['Bouwland, Alexander']","['Lykourentzou, I.']",2023-03-09T01:01:12Z,EN,"['User needs, User experience, presentation, News']",Human-Computer Interaction,"This thesis examines the role of user needs in online media, focusing on the specific
needs of online news, as well as interface customization based on user needs.
Readers of online news have a different way of interacting with news than those
who read news from newspapers or watch it on their television. These users thus
find themselves faced with different needs than those consuming news from other
media. As such, this thesis focuses on exploring which user needs are present in
the context of online news consumption in the Netherlands. There have been a
number of studies on user needs in news in the context of writing for these needs.
Dmitry Shishkin is one of the pioneers of leading these studies. As such this thesis
will look into the theories he brings forth and will build upon them. This study
will explore how user needs can be used in the context of dutch news outlets, as
well as further explore how designing for specific user needs can impact the user
experience of users. We aim to answer two questions: How well do Shishkin’s six
user needs fit to identify the user needs during an online session within a large dutch
media corporation’s news application? And secondly, How does adapting the visual
presentation of digital media products based on a specific user need change the user
experience with the application?
To do this we use evidence from user data from a large dutch media company,
namely DPG media(De persgroep), diary studies, and interviews. This study shows
how specific user needs vary from company to company, and how specific user needs
can be too granular for designing for needs. The first research question revealed
that Shishkin was mostly correct. However, there are parts of his study that do not
fit into each company. We also found that there is a specific user need for scanning
headlines. As such, we focused on this user need for the second research question.
These results revealed that users generally respond positively to prototypes that
focus on improving specific needs. However, when looking at specific prototypes
there were still many people who would prefer a standard version. As such have also
stated that they still prefer the choice of switching their user interface themselves,
having the autonomy to customize their interface. After looking through the data
and interviews, the results were consolidated into a set of guidelines for creating
scannable interfaces.
This thesis thus contributes to the field of HCI by improving upon the foundation
that was created for news media presentation and interface adaptation. But it
also proposes a set of guidelines for creating interfaces for specific user needs, as
well as contributing to the broader HCI field by filling in the gaps in user interface
adaptation."
"Studying NGO- Rapid Assessment Framework Toolkits for promoting SWM in Kohalpur, Nepal: Whose reality counts?","['Martin Rojas, Alejandro']","['Otsuki, Kei']",2023-03-09T01:01:20Z,EN,['Enabling Environment/ Solid Waste Management/ Kohalpur/ Nepal/ Integrated Sustainable Waste Management'],Sustainable Development,"Waste generation has significantly increased over the past few decades, leading to negative impacts on both humans and the environment. Developing countries struggle to effectively manage waste due to inadequate protection and collection services. To address this issue, international aid has started investing in waste management systems. However, initial efforts focused solely on technical assistance were proven to be ineffective as they lacked a full understanding of the factors affecting waste management. Nowadays, the focus has shifted to understanding what enables SWM interventions and analysing the enabling environment. To improve its waste management efforts, WASTE NL created the SQUAT tool, a rapid assessment framework toolkit to assess the enabling environment and increase the success of SWM interventions by focusing resources
The purpose of this study is to examine both informal and formal factors that enable waste management interventions in Kohalpur, Nepal, which are the actors involved in this scenario and assess their representation in the SQUAT tool. The study is based on the Integrated Sustainable Waste Management theory, which identifies six enabling components. This research focuses on the institutional, policy, and socio-cultural aspects of these components.
This study results reveal that in formal practices, a major factor enabling SWM interventions in Kohalpur, Nepal is the presence of an institutional body responsible for the SWM system and a national policy framework. In terms of socio-cultural factors, the enabling behaviour is influenced by various factors including the right to receive waste services, the perception of waste workers, and the social perception of generated waste. Most of the formal factors mentioned are captured by the tool, capturing partially the Kohalpur’s enabling environment.
However, the informal practices were not considered by the tool. In Kohalpur, the citizens, due to a lack of waste collection services, must personally manage their waste through practices such as composting and burning. These practices are aided by the informal sector, which handles the plastic, glass, and cardboard generated.
Both formal and informal waste management practices are greatly influenced by the behaviours and commitment of key actors such as the informal sector, the formal sector, the municipality, and households. These actors play a crucial role in shaping the enabling environment and can have a significant impact on it."

They varied from a shelf-to-basin fractionation change, to more biological production, and more. Furthermore, the possibility of an ocean circulation change (better, shift in deep water source) as ""initiator"" of the EOT was explored. Eventually, two ""synthesis scenarios"" were formed, which are the best fit, according to the results, with the course of the EOT. They can be divided into one giving more importance to shelf-to-basin fractionation change, and the other giving more importance to increased biological production. The research into a possible ocean circulation change as instigator of the EOT proved less fruitful, due to limitations of the model used."
Controlling nitrogen over enrichment in agriculture,"['Tuijl, Martijn van']","['Kajala, Kaisa']",2023-03-09T01:01:01Z,EN,[],Environmental Biology,"Nitrogen is one of the key ingredients that organisms require to live. Farmers have been using nitrogen fertilizers to increase their crop yields. The overuse of nitrogen fertilizer has been damaging the ecosystems that are surrounding agricultural areas. If too much nitrogen leaks into the surrounding water ways algal blooms can become harmful problems, with significant damage to the aquatic ecosystem as a result. In the nearby terrestrial ecosystems, an increase in nitrogen is also problematic as plant species that thrive in those conditions outcompete those that are not able to take advantage of the increased nitrogen levels. In order to combat these problems a decrease in nitrogen fertilization is required. These strategies are dependent on the knowledge of plant nitrogen uptake, as plants can take up nitrogen in several different forms which are all dependent on different uptake mechanisms.
Several studies have shown that often fertilizers are overused such that a decrease in application would not decrease the yield. In order for farmers to find out whether they have applied enough fertilizer they need to the ability to measure the nitrogen content in the crops that are growing in their fields. The measurement of sun induced fluorescence could allow farmers to do exactly that. By measuring the reflected light from the plants scientists have been able to accurately estimate the nitrogen content in plants at the canopy scale. If applied by farmers this would allow them to measure the nitrogen content of plants, potentially allowing them to only apply fertilizer when and where it is required. 
The other solutions proposed in this review are based on genetical engineering. Researchers found the zmm28 mutant in maize, called DP202216, to have a higher nitrogen uptake when compared to the wildtype maize strain. In this mutant a transcription factor called zmm28 is fused to a constitutive promoter. It remains unclear however what the molecular mechanism behind this increase is. Other researchers found an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant that reacts differently to nitrate deficiency stress then the wildtype. The wildtype shows reduced root growth under nitrate stress conditions, while the NAC075 mutant found by these researchers does not. In these mutants the nac075 gene is mutated such that the protein cannot leave the cells where it is produced. The underlying molecular mechanism has been uncovered which makes it an interesting target for research in other species. 
In order to actually lower the nitrogen input in the field a combination of several solutions might be the best option as they are not mutually exclusive. Using a transgenic crop similar to the mutants DP202216 or NAC075 could decrease the amount of nitrogen used in agriculture and thus reduce the severity of the problems that it causes. Farmers would also be able to measure the nitrogen content of these plants to even further decrease the amount of over fertilization."

How parents cope with the crying of their newborn is pivotal in determining whether they develop symptoms of depression, anxiety or general parenting stress. This study researched how three distinct types of infant crying (separating for fussing, crying and inconsolable crying) and problems with infant crying as perceived by the parents relate to symptoms of different parental distress outcomes (parenting stress, depression, anxiety), separating for both mothers and partners. Furthermore, a moderating effect of a psychoeducational intervention is studied. 180 mothers and partners from the Netherlands joined this study, filling in a day-to-day diary of infant crying behaviour for three consecutive days. Other variables were assessed with questionnaires. Results of the moderation analyses showed the following: (1) duration of infant crying did not relate to parental distress; (2) the intervention was not significant as a moderator in any of the relationships; (3) two exceptions were found: inconsolable crying positively predicted maternal symptoms of anxiety, which was moderated by the intervention such that for participants of the intervention, the relationship was weaker; and infant fussing negatively predicted maternal parenting stress; (4) problems with infant crying as perceived by the parents significantly predicted all parental distress outcomes (depression, anxiety, parenting stress). An implication of this study is that problems with infant crying as perceived by parents might be a strong predictor of parental distress. Further research on duration of infant crying in relation to parental distress is needed, to clarify inconsistencies between studies."

If left unrepaired or misrepaired, DBSs can be highly toxic for the cell resulting in cell death, mutations, or genomic instability, which is a hallmark of cancer development. To deal with such breaks, the cell activates the DNA damage response which will sense the DSB and activate the appropriate repair pathway. Two main repair pathways exist: non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination. The choice of repair pathway is dependent on different factors such as the cell cycle phase and the chromatin context in which the break occurred. Moreover, the different chromatin organizations will recruit different repair proteins and lead to different repair mechanisms as a way of safeguarding
genomic stability. However, in highly repetitive regions of the DNA, such as in constitutive heterochromatin, ribosomal DNA, and centromeres, there are higher risks of aberrant recombination and chromosomal rearrangement occurring during repair due to their repetitive nature. Even though these repetitive regions pose a particular danger to our genome integrity, repetitive elements cover half of our genome. It is therefore essential that the cell ensures proper repair in repetitive DNA regions to maintain genomic integrity. In this review, we give an overview of the current knowledge of the different ways repetitive DNA regions are repaired after DSBs specifically in heterochromatin, ribosomal DNA, and centromeres."
Effects of continuation versus discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment on white matter microstructure in first episode psychosis,"['A, Julia van der']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-03-20T14:45:22Z,EN,['DTI; antipsychotics; psychosis'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have reported decreased white matter (WM) integrity in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients. However, the impact of long-term exposure and discontinuation of antipsychotic medications on WM in FEP patients is unclear.  

Methods: Fifty-four FEP patients three to six months in remission underwent DTI scanning at baseline and 31 patients were re-scanned after 12 months, during which patients either continued or discontinued antipsychotic medication. Voxel-wise between-group (continue/discontinue) comparisons of fractional anisotropy (FA) values were performed at baseline and follow-up. Additionally, linear mixed models were performed to assess the interaction between time (baseline/follow-up) and continuation versus discontinuation on FA values of WM tracts. 

Results: Voxel-wise between group comparisons demonstrated no significant differences in FA at baseline or follow-up. However, longitudinal analyses indicated increased FA in the left (t = 2.53, p = 0.0181) and right (t = 2.38, p = 0.0251) corticospinal tract after antipsychotic discontinuation, although the results did not survive multiple comparisons correction. Further, a trend toward a relationship between the decrease in antipsychotic dosage and increased FA in the right cingulum (t = 2.029, p = 0.0597) was observed. 

Conclusions: The current study provided tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics after achieving remission from FEP is associated with increased FA in the bilateral corticospinal tract. Future studies should investigate whether the changes in FA observed in this study reflect reversal of a pathological process, as this can provide important insight into the potential risks and/or benefits of antipsychotic maintenance treatment after FEP."

is connected to the MIS to provide another analytical lens. Following the
steps of problem-solution diagnosis, structural analysis, functional analysis,
and system barrier analysis, the following research questions are answered:
1. Given the context of the EU-level mission of doubling the renovation
rate until 2030 as a step-stone to achieve climate neutrality in 2050,
what systemic barriers hinder Germany to contribute to these goals by
reaching its own the respective 2030 and 2045 goals the country has
already set?
2. How does the MLG structure influence said MIS in terms of directionality
and clarity?
A qualitative approach was chosen with 15 interviews, a complementary document
analysis, desk research of relevant policy documents, reports, websites,
and experts consulted for specific questions. Based on the analysis, various
barriers were identified, e.g., the lack of definitions and data by which to assess
progress, governance structures being understaffed and underfinanced and yet,
of vital importance for mission progress, the inachievability of the mission of
a resource, monetary, or time perspective, internal discourses of framing and
lobbying put up by incumbents that cements its power by means of standardisation.
Possible alleviations and solution pathways are discussed. The thesis
closes with reflections on how to improve the MIS framework. The research has
been completed without an internship."
The Mismatch Negativity: Four machine learning approaches for predicting dyslexia in infants on EEG data,"['Prins, Nadine']","['Schnack, Hugo']",2023-03-20T14:49:50Z,EN,['EEG; Machine Learning; Developmental Dyslexia; Prediction; Connectivity'],Artificial Intelligence,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) in combination with machine learning (ML) techniques is becoming an increasingly popular method in medicine for clinical disorders prediction. This study applies ML techniques to the ePod dataset developed by the ePODIUM project, for the prediction of developmental dyslexia in infants. The dataset contains EEG recordings of 129 infants, existing out of two groups with dyslexic- and non-dyslexic parents, obtained from an experiment with auditory stimuli for eliciting a Mismatch Negativity (MMN). Four different approaches for feature selection are used to see the differences in performance on different ML algorithms. The baseline approach uses the MMN of all EEG channels. The second approach includes EEG channels reported in the literature as the most informative. The t-test approach uses significance testing, verified using a t-test on the ePod data, and resulted in a selection of significantly different channels between the two groups. The final approach uses the channels from the ePod data that show the highest connectivity with other channels. The algorithms used on the different feature input approaches are support vector machine, logistic regression, decision tree, multilayer perceptron, and convolutional neural network. The convolutional neural network showed the highest performance in combination with the features of the t-test approach with an
accuracy of 73%. However, this result is not significant (p=0.447) because of high variation in model performance. The connectivity approach performs also well based on average accuracy with the convolutional neural network. The traditional machine learning algorithms support vector machines and logistic regression can learn from the t-test and connectivity with moderate accuracy of 60%. The results show that data-driven selected features, using significance testing and connectivity, are promising in predicting developmental dyslexia in infants in combination with deep learning and traditional machine learning models."

Dawn of the Dutch Petrostate: Corporate Sovereignty on the Jambian Oil Frontier 1904-1923,"['Vonk, Christiaan']","['Plets, G.F.J.']",2023-03-20T14:52:29Z,EN,"['Environmental History, Oil, Petrostate, Indonesia, Colonialism, Shell']",History,"This thesis traces the colonial origins of the Dutch petrostate. During the first two decades of the 20th century, Jambi (a region in East-Sumatra) was known to contain significant oil reserves. In this thesis, I analyse how the Dutch state and the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (precursor of Shell) competed and cooperated regarding the future oil industry in Jambi. Ultimately, both parties became associates in a public-private joint venture that would exploit Jambian oil: Nederlandsch-Indische Aardolie Maatschappij (NIAM). NIAM’s creation, however, was built on evading democratic pressures and a considerable state-corporate power asymmetry. By conceptualising Jambi as a colonial “resource frontier” and theorising about the “corporate sovereignty” of oil companies, I argue that NIAM marks the golden spike of the Dutch petrostate. Finally, I make the point that NIAM’s inception continues to leave a deciding mark on the Dutch petroleum industry today."
The impact of arousal levels on reversal learning,"['Waverijn, Margretha']","['Krypotos, Angelos']",2023-03-20T14:52:24Z,EN,['avoidance; reversal learning; emotional arousal; exploitation; exploration'],Clinical Psychology,This study explored how different levels of arousal may influence reversal learning.

After first looking at the recent history of post-Cold War post-conflict reconstruction (peacebuilding and statebuilding) and synthesizing dominant approaches on the liberal and realist axis, the analysis turns specifically to the cooperation of the United States and the European Union. Though institutionally different with regards to decision-making and military/civilian capabilities, both the moral and strategic importance of post-war stabilization resonated across the Atlantic. A trove of leaked cables illuminate the day to day process of their work in Kosovo, showing a deeply involved, proactive and result-oriented US and a more reticent, process-based and careful EU. Indeed. while sharing similar end goals (Kosovo as a multi-ethnic liberal democracy incorporated within Euro-Atlantic structures), the approaches towards Kosovo and Serbia deviated. Again, this was due to their institutional differences, but also the historical relationship to Kosovo and the proximity of Kosovo to Europe. It becomes clear that academic distinctions between realist and liberal approaches are blurred in practice, as policymakers grasp onto aspects of both to argue for similar policies. Still, as Kosovo’s case became marred with problems and dead-locked, the overall aims of transatlantic peacebuilding in Kosovo became decidedly less ambitious and in a sense more realist in character."
Classifying Legally Actionable Threats using Language Models,"['Rijk, Noud de']","['Mosteiro Romero, Pablo']",2023-04-21T00:00:53Z,EN,['Language model; NLP; Threat; Legal'],Business Informatics,"Threat classification is a relatively new research field in the Natural Language Pro-
cessing domain. It pertains to models attempting to classify what texts constitute
a threat and which texts do not. This is an essential research field as uttering
threats is illegal as opposed to insulting someone.
This research operationalizes the Dutch legal definition of what constitutes
a threat and investigates to what extent a language model can classify legally
actionable threats from texts. Language models are the state-of-the-art technique
for numerous NLP tasks, including text classification. In the text classification
domain, it allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to be pre-trained on millions of
tokens before fine-tuning the model on a downstream task. In this way, a language
model is created that learns the syntax of a language. This pre-training negates
the problem of data scarcity, which is a recurring problem in threat classification.
In this study, the application of a language model is compared to previously used
models in the threat classification domain (i.e. BiLSTM, CNN, Naive Bayes, &
SVM). The performance metrics that the models are compared with are F1-scores
and Precision-Recall Area-Under-Curve (PR-AUC) score. All models are trained
on publicly available datasets containing threats and non-threats that are manually
re-annotated. Additionally, the models are evaluated with two datasets, namely
a Dutch dataset and an English dataset. The goal of these models is to predict
whether a threat that is uttered is legally actionable. The models were evaluated 
by means of a stratified 10-fold split.
The results of the study are that it is possible to operationalize the Dutch le-
gal definition by means of annotation guidelines. Two annotators re-annotated a
Dutch and English threat dataset and their agreement was not caused by chance
and the Dutch dataset was deemed sufficient for the target institution (i.e. the
National Police). The language model subsequently statistically significantly out-
performed the benchmark models in the majority of performance metrics."

Here we focused specifically on exosomes. In vitro visualization was done by combining two PM bound MVB markers, ORP1L and Arl8b, with exosome reporter CD63-pHluorin. Here, we found that ORP1L was a better candidate than Arl8b, which caused MVB anomalies. TREx was used to visualize precursor-exosomes, otherwise known as ILVs, with CD63-pHluorin contained in PM bound ORP1L MVBs. Visualization of EVs in vivo was was achieved by adaptation and optimization of the TREx protocol for a zebrafish animal model. The main challenges revolved around the optimization of the gel composition to properly embed the fish in the gel and the optimization of expansion kinetics due to tissue heterogeneity which can cause distortions in the sample. Imaging efforts were focused on the caudal vein plexus area of the zebrafish were EVs accumulate. The optimized TREx protocol allowed the visualization of single EVs inside the zebrafish which provided more insight on EV fates in vivo with higher resolution than previously acquired. Overall, our research highlights the great potential of TREx microscopy in the field of EVs."

Methods: Transcriptomes of 59 Mexican ALM patients with varying ulceration status were analysed through
the Feature-Engine Python library, which ranked genes based on how much their expression differs between
ulcerated and non-ulcerated tumours. This ranking was analysed through gene set enrichment analysis to
identify biological components.

Results: Multiple proteins that make up desmosomes (a cell-cell adhesion complex) appear downregulated in
ulcerated tumours. The genes PERP and TP63, which are thought to be essential to desmosome formation, also
appear downregulated.

Conclusion: Given the role desmosomes play in both skin integrity and tumour suppression, we hypothesize
them to be the link between ulceration and the associated worsened clinical outcomes. PERP could be involved

An abductive explanation is a minimal subset of input variables that guarantees the observed classification. A contrastive explanation is a minimal subset of input variables that, when changed, could lead to another predicted class. We show that computing these types of explanations for Bayesian network classifiers (Bayesian networks used as classifiers) is NP-hard for contrastive explanations and co-NP-hard for abductive explanations. We define a number of subproblem for finding contrastive and abductive explanations. For contrastive explanations, we find that the problems of computing any contrastive explanation is already NP-hard for Bayesian networks where inference can be applied in polynomial time. We propose a number of simple algorithms that are able to solve the different subproblems by computing inference for multiple subsets of evidence. Lastly we propose an algorithm that can compute abductive and contrastive explanations more efficiently and reduces redundant calculations by looking at the internal structure and values of the Bayesian network. The algorithm solves a more general problem: finding all assignments to a given set of evidence nodes that satisfy a constraint on a hypothesis node. Finding contrastive and abductive explanations is a special case of the algorithm."

A retrospective study on dalteparin dosage and anti-Xa levels in renal impairment,"['Hassan, Mohammed']","['Lalmohammed, Arief']",2023-05-03T00:00:43Z,EN,"['LMWH, anti-Xa levels, renally impaired patients,']",Farmacie,"Abstract

Background and aims: Different recommendations are given in international guidelines regarding the correct LMWH dose using anti-Xa levels for renally impaired patients. This multi-centre retrospective cohort study researched which therapeutic dosage of the LMWH dalteparin for patients with renal impairment is most resembling to the standard therapeutic dosage of dalteparin for patients without renal impairment.  Moreover, it was researched how many anti-Xa levels were measured correctly; how many anti-Xa levels reached the target range based on the present guidelines, and how many bleeding incidents happened in the various treatment groups. 

Method: All anti-Xa levels that were recorded in the ETZ and FGV between April 2018 and March 2021 were extracted to compile the patients. Patients were split into three groups: a reference group (those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] > 50 ml/min) and two groups (those with an eGFR 30 ml/min) that received dalteparin at either a 100% dose or a 50% dose reduction, respectively. The primary outcome was the median anti-Xa for each group. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the reference group's median anti-Xa levels to those of the two different treatment groups. Potential confounders were considered baseline variables that varied significantly between groups. To determine whether these potential confounders had an impact on the primary outcome, linear regression was performed. The secondary outcomes were the proportion (%) of anti-Xa levels measured in the correct way, the proportion (%) of anti-Xa levels reaching the target range based on the present guidelines, and the proportion (%) of patients where bleeding incidents happened in the various treatment groups. 

Results: From the multi-center retrospective cohort study of this thesis, 133 patients were included from which 149 anti-Xa levels were analyzed. Three treatment groups were determined: a reference group (patients with normal renal function (eGFR > 50ml/min) and a standard dalteparin dose (200 IU/kg/day ±20%)), group A (patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 30ml/min) and a standard dalteparin dose (200 IU/kg/day ±20%)), and group B (patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 30ml/min) and a 50% dalteparin dose reduction (100 IU/kg/day ±20%)). The median anti-Xa levels for a once-daily dosing regimen of dalteparin were 0.80 (IQR 0.60-1.16) for the reference group, 0.83 (IQR 0.65-1.02) for group A and 0.42 (IQR 0.42-0.605) for group B. The median anti-Xa levels for dalteparin were 0.5 (IQR 0.345-0.915) for the reference group, 0.5 (IQR 0.315-0.735) for group A, and 0.3 (IQR 0.275-0.403) for group B for a twice-daily dosage regimen. The once-daily dosing regimen (p=.001) and twice-daily dosing regimen (p=.003) were significantly different for group B compared to the reference group. The anti-Xa levels between the treatment groups A and B were also significantly different for both the once-daily dosing regimen (p=.001) and twice-daily dosing regimen (p=.008). A proportion of 52.7% of the anti-Xa levels were measured correctly. Regarding meeting the target range, group A (23.1%) was most resembling to the reference group (28.9%) compared to group B (10.3%). Group A had a bigger chance of getting major bleeding events (12.3%) compared to group B (10.3%). Within the dose regimens, the once-daily group had a higher proportion (13.6%) with major bleeding events compared to the twice-daily dosing group (7.8%). 

Conclusion: It was found that for both the once-daily and twice-daily dosage regimen a 100% dalteparin dosage for patients with renal impairment is most resembling to the standard therapeutic dosage of dalteparin for patients with no renal impairment. After 3 administrations, blood sampling can be done to obtain the anti-Xa level and apply dosage reduction if necessary. Due to power limitations of t"
Inhalation toxicity of cinnamaldehyde: A physiologically based kinetic modeling approach to study route-to-route extrapolation,"['Lugt, Joris van der']","['Kramer, Nynke']",2023-05-04T00:00:49Z,EN,"['PBK, Inhalation toxicology, in silico toxicology, model, in vitro, Cinnamaldehyde, population based model']",Toxicology and Environmental Health,"Layman summary 
A physiologically based kinetic modeling approach to study route-to-route extrapolation
The cigarette is slowly disappearing from the streets all over the world. In its stead a relatively new phenomenon the electronic cigarette has risen from cigarette stopping aid to new prominence. A electronic cigarette is a relatively simple device that heats up a carrier liquid such as propylene glycol together with nicotine and often an assortment of flavouring agents this combination can then be inhaled. This method of ingesting nicotine has been hailed as advancement in public health as it appears considerably less toxic in comparison to the smoking of tobacco. This has lead to increased scrutiny to the assorted flavouring agents that can be found in the electronic cigarettes. These flavouring agents often have a long history of safe use in food and/or perfume applications. but history has taught us that the method of exposure for a chemical determines in large part the toxicity that it causes. And unfortunate many of these flavouring agents have had no inhalation toxicity test performed to assess if they pose a hazard. This represents a possible problem in toxicological assessment of these chemicals for use in electronic cigarettes as animal testing is expensive, potentially misleading and progressively more frowned upon. This report explores a route to route extrapolation approach using a physiologically based kinetic model (PBK) to assess the possible risk of adverse health effects due to cinnamaldehyde exposure in electronic cigarette emissions. A PBK is a mathematical model that attempts to predict the movement of a chemical through the body by defining the body in organ compartments which are connected by a circulatory system. The chemical can move through the circulatory system and its movement is dictated by chemical properties such as its lipophilicity. This allows researchers to model novel exposure scenarios without the need of testing animals. The chemical of interest is cinnamaldehyde which is the main component of cinnamon flavour. It is a common flavouring agent found in food, perfumes and electronic cigarettes. It has been found in concentration up to 300 mg/ml in electronic cigarettes. It has been found to cause induce toxicity in vitro systems at concentration as low as 40 µM. Using PBK models for both rat and human oral and inhalation exposures this report has found significant differences between exposure routes in how cinnamaldehyde is metabolised. This difference in metabolic profiles means that cinnamaldehyde concentrations are considerably higher during inhalation exposure compared to oral exposure. Cinnamaldehyde concentration in the lung reached concentration found to cause adverse effects in in vitro systems during simulated electronic cigarette usages. Some population differences were also found between simulated males and females. With cinnamaldehyde concentrations being higher on average. This report underlines the importance of the exposure route during risk assessment and the possibilities of PBK modelling going forward. Important next steps in PBK risk assessments are solving the problem of lack of validation data when trying to avoid animal testing. Major drawbacks of the report are a lack of validation data and the lack of Glutathione modelling in the lung."
"The Search for a Rigorous, Generally Applicable
Formulation of Inclusive Fitness Theory","['Saccheri, Jeroen']","['Hermsen, Rutger']",2023-05-02T23:00:59Z,EN,[],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"Since its introduction in the 1960s, inclusive fitness theory and its results, especially Hamilton’s rule, have been the topic of unresolved and ongoing debate. Over the past decade, arguments have increased in intensity following an outspoken critique by Nowak et al. in 2010. Opponents claim that general applications of the theory result in complex relationships between the quantities it describes, giving no real insights into how social behaviours may be positively selected; but specific applications are limited in scope, making it difficult to compare between cases.
This project looks to assess to what extent generality of Hamilton’s rule comes at a detriment to its causal descriptive power. To assess this, I first describe the various forms that the parameters of cost, benefit and relatedness in Hamilton’s rule may take, and assess their theoretical limitations in each case. I then consider how Hamilton’s rule may be applied to a computational simulation model where all details of the system may be known, provide rigorous definitions of parameters that may be applied to an empirical study, and demonstrate
what restrictions apply. Finally, I analyse previous results that utilised Hamilton’s rule to interpret experimental data, examining to what extent predictions between experiments using inclusive fitness theory may be unified.
It is shown that while there is a wealth of empirical data indicating that altruism can evolve if it increases an individual’s ‘inclusive fitness’, how this fitness is defined subtly differs from case to case, with no clear path to link these results to each other. Despite the value in these experimental results, further work must be taken in order to unify predictions made by Hamilton’s rule before it can be considered a fully general method usable to interpret the conditions for the evolution of altruism. Nevertheless, it remains the most general method known for understanding the evolution of altruism thus far."
Traditional Folk Music in a Polarizing Europe: An Expedient to Cultural Sovereignty?,"['Harmsen, Gabriël']","['Ahrendt, Rebekah']",2023-05-04T00:00:45Z,EN,['traditional folk music; folk music; traditional music; cultural sovereignty; NGO; JM International; Ethno Sweden; neo-nationalism; polarization; nativism; nationalism; populism; expediency; humanitarianism'],Musicology,"“Folk” or “traditional” music is commonly used by governments, political movements, and NGOs to bolster cultural identities and to promote cultural heritage. On the one hand, folk music is implemented to assert difference by signifying the particularity of cultures. On the other hand, this particularity undergirds humanitarian music projects where diversity of musical traditions is meant to signify universal values. The efficacy of music in human rights practices has only recently received critical attention, and scholarship on traditional genres in this context is scarce. A critical discussion of contemporary folk music instrumentalization is becoming increasingly urgent, as cultural debates in Europe and beyond are polarizing and nativist populist movements are drawing traditional music into exclusionist, xenophobic, and racist frames of cultural protectionism.

I argue that in times of polarization, music NGOs, governments, and political movements use musical heritage as an expedient to assert or maintain cultural sovereignty. To conceptualize folk music as a resource for humanitarian and political cultural sovereignty claims, I draw on George Yúdice’s concept of cultural expediency, Simon Bornschier’s “new cultural divide,” sovereignty discourse, and (ethno)musicological scholarship. I focus on the humanitarian perspective in a case study of the NGO Jeunesses Musicales International (JMI) and its folk music program Ethno World. Through an analysis of primary sources and JMI’s organizational structure, I pose that while adhering to the humanitarian understanding of cultural sovereignty, JMI’s network relies on public funding and national policies, placing the network in the domain of cultural sovereignty of the state. Using Ethno Sweden, the first ever Ethno program, as a case study, I examine the gathering in relation to Swedish cultural policy and speculate how it may be affected by the national government’s recent shift towards the right. I compare opposing claims of cultural sovereignty where Swedish folk music serves as an expedient and address practical limitations of Ethno Sweden’s humanitarianism through twenty-four semi-structured interviews with Ethno participants, folk music activists, and representatives of youth music organizations. Finally, I suggest folk music’s expediency to cultural sovereignty leads to a diffusion of political and humanitarian objectives in the cultural heritage arena, a persisting romanticization of traditional folk music genres, and an ineffective reliance on music as a universal language in humanitarian music projects."
Comparative genomic analysis of Actinobacillus suis,"['Abou Fakher, Alaa']","['Nes, Arie van']",2023-05-03T07:11:58Z,EN,[],Gezondheidszorg landbouwhuisdieren en vet. volksgezondheid,"Objective
The Gram-negative bacterium Actinobacillus suis is an agent of global importance to the swine industry and the cause of lethal respiratory or septicaemic disease in pigs of different ages. Between 2018 and 2019, seven commercial farms in western Canada experienced episodes of increased mortality due to A. suis infection in grower pigs. The goal of this work was to profile, with molecular methods, A. suis isolated from diseased pigs and to compare them to other isolates.

Design
This inferential observational study used nine western Canadian strains obtained from diseased lungs (n = 6), heart (n = 2) and brain (n = 1) and whole genome sequencing was performed. Comparative genomic analyses were performed to characterise the genetic variability, antimicrobial resistance and the virulence genes present.

Results
Compared to the reference strain (ATCC 33415), an increased number of RTX (repeats in the structural toxin) gene copies were identified in strains isolated from organs without a mucosal surface, thus theoretically harder to invade. Western Canadian strains did not harbour genes associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents used in swine production. Novel regions were also identified in the genomes of five of nine strains demonstrating recombination and emergence of novel strains.

Conclusions
The results obtained in this study were associated with the emergence of new lineages. An increased number of RTX toxin gene copies is suggested to be associated with increased virulence. This study will contribute to improve our understanding regarding A. suis and may help guide vaccine development and agent control measures."

two groups, they were fed the same feed and were kept together in one pen. The probiotics group 
received a treatment with the Probiotics Biokult Advanced® and Orthiflor Plus® for four days. The

Moreover, no significant difference in body condition score and hair coat condition were detected.
Furthermore, the general impression of the goats remained unchanged. Based on the results of this

Scheduling with explorable uncertainty for minimising the total weighted completion time,"['Zhang, Xiao']","['Liu, Alison']",2023-05-03T00:00:45Z,EN,[],Computing Science,"This thesis addresses the problem of scheduling with explorable uncertainty on a single machine. We

Moreover, each job j has a weight wj ∈ N. The machine can either test a job or execute a job.
The duration of executing any job j is either  ̄u or pj , depending on whether the job was tested

De aanleiding voor dit onderzoek is tweeledig. Enerzijds het gegeven dat dit schilderij de afgelopen decennia aan uiteenlopende schilders is toegeschreven, zonder dat de specialisten hun toeschrijving hebben gebaseerd op resultaten van herkomstonderzoek, materiaaltechnisch onderzoek, iconografisch onderzoek en stilistisch onderzoek. Anderzijds de unieke gelegenheid die mij is geboden het schilderij ten huize van de eigenaar met eigen ogen te bestuderen. 
	In deze scriptie is gestreefd de identiteit van de schilder van Lot en zijn dochters te bepalen op basis van onderzoek waarbij alle beschikbare methodes zijn gehanteerd, inbegrepen literatuuronderzoek, empirisch onderzoek en archiefonderzoek. Zo heeft dit toeschrijvingsonderzoek ertoe geleid dat het aannemelijk is dat Lot en zijn dochters in Rome tussen 1620 en 1630 is vervaardigd en dat de schilder afkomstig was uit de Noordelijke Nederlanden. Het onderzoek heeft uitgewezen dat de schilder is beïnvloed niet alleen door de werken van Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571-1610) in het algemeen, maar vooral door die van caravaggistische schilders als Dirck van Baburen (1595-1624), Nicolas Régnier (1591-1667), Johann Liss (1597-1631), Bartolomeo Manfredi (1582-1622) en Giovanni Antonio Galli (1597-1649). Hetgeen suggereert dat de schilder van Lot en zijn dochters actief was in hun directe kring. Hoewel het uiteindelijk onmogelijk is gebleken Lot en zijn dochters aan een bepaalde schilder toe te schrijven, heeft het onderzoek geresulteerd in een gedetailleerde documentatie van het werk op basis waarvan vragen over de herkomst, gebruikte materialen en technieken, iconografie en stijl voor het eerst zijn beantwoord."

Applications of surface guided imaging in radiotherapy: A literature review,"['Bishas, Pranto']","['Seravalli, Enrica']",2023-05-25T01:01:07Z,EN,"['Surface-guided radiotherapy, cone-beam computed tomography, four-dimensional computed tomography,\nstereotactic radiosurgery, whole-brain radiotherapy, DeepInspiration-Breath-hold and accelerated partial breast irradiation']",Medical Imaging,"SGRT is a technique that uses real-time 3D imaging of the surface of a patient's body to guide radiation therapy. It scans the patient's body using light and provides accurate information about their position and movement during the treatment. This technique has gained attention because it can deliver radiation more precisely to the target area while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. It offers advantages such as real-time information about the patient's entire body surface, continuous monitoring of positioning, and standardized workflow, which leads to reduced treatment time. It can be used alongside other imaging techniques and improves the accuracy, safety, and effectiveness of radiotherapy.

SGRT is as accurate or even better than traditional methods for positioning patients, depending on the body part being treated. It has a wide field of view, allowing for better correction of patient position and improved treatment posture. It is also faster than laser or x-ray-based methods for patient positioning, by reducing fraction time.

However, there are limitations to SGRT. The system requires clear visibility of the patient's skin surface and should not be obstructed by equipment or material in the treatment room. It may also not always provide enough information about the internal anatomy to precisely locate the target, so other imaging systems are still needed. SGRT is best used as a complement to these systems.

Personally, I would recommend using SGRT because it provides imaging without exposing the patient to additional radiation, offers real-time feedback, and has high-resolution 3D images. It can be integrated with other radiation therapy techniques to ensure patient comfort and safety. However, it's important to consider that SGRT systems can be expensive to acquire and maintain, while MR-linac systems offer similar advantages without relying on continuous visibility of the patient's surface but at a much higher cost.

In the future, SGRT could be used alongside new radiation techniques to further enhance patient safety and comfort."

One of the most prominent changes is in membrane morphology. Enteroviral infection causes the formation of Replication Organelles (ROs) that increase viral replication. ROs are rearranged membranes with different properties to any cellular membranes and serve as platforms for assembly of replication complexes and new virions. Many cellular pathways are modulated by viral proteins to create an environment suited for viral replication. These include manipulation of intracellular trafficking and lipid metabolism. Lipid droplets also play a role in effective infection by shuttling lipids towards ROs. Late during infection autophagy plays a role in non-lytic release by wrapping ROs in more membranes and allowing for the egress of vesicles filled with virions. Finally, recent advances in cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) are discussed that can allow the study of viral replication in situ in previously unachievable detail."

Impact of cancer-associated fibroblasts on tumour micro-environment heterogeneity in response to chemotherapy,"['Plas, Tim van der']","['Kranenburg, Onno']",2023-05-25T00:00:39Z,EN,[],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Despite many advances in surgery, chemotherapy and personalised medicine, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. After curative treatment, 30% to 40% of patients relapse. The tumour micro-environment (TME), and the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that reside in it, play a major role in CRC tumour progression and resistance to treatment. 
Here, we analyse two CAF subtypes with a mutually exclusive gene expression pattern that were identified from a biobank of patient-derived CAFs. CAFs from these subtypes are co-cultured in a 3D TME model with patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from CRC tumours to assess their influence on tumour growth via a luciferase reporter. Furthermore, tumour growth and gene expression dynamics are monitored upon treatment of the model with chemotherapy. We find that certain CAFs from both subtypes increase tumour growth and drive resistance to therapy. In addition, we see how CAFs from one subtype drive aggregation of the PDOs in our TME model. Lastly, we show how healthy fibroblasts in co-culture with PDOs increase expression of CAF markers upon oxaliplatin treatment. 
Taken together, this study underlines the bidirectional interactions of tumour cells and CAFs in the TME of CRC carcinomas to drive disease progression and resistance to treatment. These findings merit further research to distinguish CAF clusters that drive these interactions and discover new biomarkers."

The struggle of a community: A case study of a community struggling against the effects of gentrification through the use of a CLT,"['Meeusen, Thijs']","['Friendly, Abigail']",2023-06-09T23:00:38Z,EN,['Community land trusts; Gentrification; Right to the city; Urban Commons; Amsterdam'],Spatial Planning,"Worldwide, cities struggle to provide sufficient affordable housing for their residents. This is 
also the case in Amsterdam, where a change in demand in combination with the promotion of 
homeownership led to a strong decline in the social housing stock. This led to gentrification in 
some neighbourhoods. Every part of the city has its development regarding these processes, 
but the community of the H-buurt in the southeast of Amsterdam currently experiences the 
threat of gentrification. 
Gentrification is a complex phenomenon that is not receptive to a single definition. Many 
different authors have shed light on the concept and there are different schools of thought on 
the exact functioning of the process. Distinctive for all gentrification processes is that they 
revolve around neighbourhood change, whereby affluent people start to move into a 
neighbourhood which is mainly inhabited by people with lower incomes. The influx of more 
affluent citizens causes housing prices to rise and eventually leads to displacement pressure 
or the displacement of people with lower incomes (Boterman & van Gent, 2014; Doucet, 2014; 
Hamnett, 1991; Zukin et al., 2009).
This study aims to explore the potential application of community land trusts in the Netherlands 
and their impact on gentrification processes. So, what are community land trusts? These are 
non-profit organisations that hold land for a community. A characteristic of this community is 
that the members are typically bound through the area they inhabit. A CLT functions as a
steward for affordable housing and other forms of community infrastructure in perpetuity, on 
behalf of and in favour of the community (Center for Community Land Trust Innovation, 2022). 
Even though there are studies that suggest a moderating effect of CLTs on gentrification, there 
is not extensive enough research to give a definitive statement about this (Angotti, 2007; 
Bunce, 2018; Choi et al., 2017; Engelsman, 2016). Therefore, more research is needed in 
which different contexts are explored. 
To fulfil the aim of this research, a case study was conducted. The chosen case is the CLT Hbuurt located in the aforementioned southeastern part of Amsterdam. Not only does this case 
offer an outlook into the emergence of a CLT in a different context, but it is also the first CLT 
that is set up in the Netherlands. This CLT aims to create affordable housing and community 
infrastructure, all in favour of the local community.
The case was researched through qualitative research during which semi-structured interviews 
were held with actors in the dynamic of the case study, as well as with experts in the field of 
CLTs that were not directly involved in the case. The results of these interviews went into the 
conditions that lead to the emergence of CLTs. The internal governance of CLTs. The 
governance challenges of CLTs and the potential impact that CLTs could have on 
communities. These topics were discussed in regard to the case, and the general information 
gathered from the expert interviews.
The results of this study suggest that CLTs often result from the existence of a strong 
community within a financialised housing system from which the community feels excluded, 
even though the context in which CLTs are set up varies extensively. Besides these conditions, 
the model itself has many variations to it. Therefore, it can be applied in many different contexts 
and can be tailored to different systems. In the CLT H-buurt, this variation was also used as 
the division of seats on the board is different from most CLTs as it has no public 
representatives. A further characteristic of CLTs is the dependence on governments. In many 
cases, governments provide CLTs with funding and/or land. This creates a certain level of 
dependability which makes CLTs vulnerable to political developments that might change th"
SIMULATING RAT DENSITY IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS,"['Moretti, Lucia']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-06-09T23:00:50Z,EN,[],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"Urban centers are constantly growing, and cities are becoming some of the most widespread habitats. Metropolises represent ecosystem hubs, hosting more and more species. The number of animals choosing cities as their ideal habitat has grown to such extent that the word synurbic has been coined to describe the phenomena. Cohabitation of different animals in urban areas can develop beneficial synergies which should be protected and incentivized. However, in some circumstances it might be necessary to control the expansion of species and brown rats often fall in this category.
Rats are considered a threat to food quality, urban infrastructure, and public physical and mental health. Multiple efforts have been made to control their spread. However, despite their presence dating back to the 18th century, not many successful ways to manage rats have been developed. The inefficiency to regulate rodents’ infestations can be linked with a general lack of knowledge on their environmental behaviors. Such gap partly depends on the complexity of developing efficient techniques to study rats in the wild.
This study aims at experimenting with Agent Based Models (ABMs) as possible tools to gain more insights on rat presence and movements in cities. In this project, the process to create an ABM with the GAMA software is described and the growth of a hypothetical rat population is simulated in the Rivierenbuurt neighborhood of Amsterdam. The model analyzes the correlation between the availability of food and the colonization time. It also proposes some application scenarios, exploring possible inputs for rats’ management strategies.
The final findings identified that, based on the simulation, the amount of food has a stronger impact on the capacity of the block than its distribution. The results also showcased how in the context of the Rivierenbuurt, control strategies based on predator’s introduction or on a revision of the garbage collection plan might be more effective than spatial ones such as the construction of some rat barriers or a buildings renovation intervention.
This project finalized some observations and conclusions that can be considered valuable information for the interested case study area. However, it remains difficult to comprehend the accuracy of the outputs when transferred from the simulated reality to the actual world."
The road towards in vitro expansion of Regulatory T cells in an antigen-driven manner,"['Griffioen, Merel']","['Broere, Femke']",2023-06-08T23:00:44Z,EN,"['Regulatoire T cellen, Regulatory T cells, Rheumatoid Arthritis, autoimmunity, expension, antigen-specific, expansion protocol, T cells, TNFR2, TNFR2-agonist,  mammalian mB29a, peptide-specific,']",Drug Innovation,"Current treatments for Rheumatoid Arthritis aim at remission, often rendering patients immunocompromised. Novel treatments options would therefore be beneficial. It is hypothesized that a dysfunction of Regulatory T cells plays a role in the pathology of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Thus, ex vivo polyclonal culturing of Regulatory T cells, followed by adoptive cell therapy would be a potential new therapy. Hereby, the number and function of Regulatory T cells can be restored. Although this approach shows potential, it comes with limitations, such as a lack of potency and specificity together with a higher risk of generalized immunosuppression. To overcome these, the use of antigen-specific Regulatory T cells would be more beneficial. However, antigen-specific expansion is challenging due to, among others, low available cell numbers. A method in which the high cell yields of polyclonal expansion are combined with the specificity of antigen-specific Regulatory T cells is therefore needed. 
In our research we move towards a method by which Regulatory T cells can be expanded in an antigen-specific manner. To this end, a protocol for the polyclonal expansion of Regulatory T cells is established using low concentrations of TransAct, high concentrations of rhIL-2 and addition of a TNFR2-agonist, leading to high expansion numbers while retaining a stable phenotype. We show that cells expanded under these conditions can potentially be restimulated in an antigen-specific manner with mammalian B29a, a heat shock protein hypothesized to be involved in Rheumatoid Arthritis. This enables us to obtain a high number of B29a-specific Regulatory T cells from which potentially, in future research, TCRs can be isolated."

U-curve acculturation process and the perception of inclusion within the local

conducting in-depth interviews with ten participants to explore their experiences of 
cultural adjustment and development of cultural identity over time. The analysis 
revealed several themes related to cultural identity, including internal curiosity, family 
heritage, stigma, and religion. Participants also reported on the challenges of the 
acculturation process, including language, cultural perception, and community 
integration. Furthermore, the study revealed feelings of nostalgia and cultural 
bereavement related to the loss of the participants' original culture. The findings suggest 
that cultural adjustment is a complex and dynamic process that requires a supportive

Ship Heave Motion Prediction Using LSTM Neural Networks Without Wave Excitation Information,"['Keijzer, Jolan']","['Panja, Deb']",2023-06-08T23:00:47Z,EN,[],Applied Data Science,"In off-shore multi-body operations, it is important to accurately determine the movements of the vessels
to allow for safe operations. This is especially evident in multi-body operations that involve helicopters,
due to the relative motion between the landing deck and the helicopter. To be able to augment human
judgement in helicopter/off-shore vessel multi-body operations, it is crucial to have accurate predictions
of the movements of the vessel. One of the key movements of off-shore vessels in these operations is the
heave motion, which represents the up and down movements of the vessel. Modelling these movements
mathematically is a difficult feat due to the strong non-linearity of these movements, and the complicated
hydrodynamic forces and stochastic sea disturbances that are at the root of these movements. Therefore,
Neural Networks bear a lot of opportunity in this regard, because of their strong ability of handling
non-linearity. Especially, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are useful in this regard owing
to their strong ability of handling sequences and their ability of learning both long- and short-term
dependencies. However, most existing research uses wave excitation information to predict the heave
motion even though ships are not often equipped with expensive wave detection systems. Therefore,
this paper researches whether LSTM models are able to accurately predict heave motions 10 and 20
seconds ahead without the usage of wave excitation information. This paper shows that LSTM models
are able to achieve accurate predictions without the usage of wave excitation information. Therefore,
it is shown that LSTM models have the ability to augment human judgement in helicopter/off-shore
vessel operations where this wave excitation information is not available. Especially in terms of 10
second ahead predictions LSTM is able to achieve promising prediction performance. However, the
prediction quality of the 20 second ahead predictions is less satisfying. Finally, most existing papers
used simple one-layer LSTM models, whereas this paper shows that using more complicated models
lead to increased prediction performance.

DNA methylation as predictor of clozapine response in treatment-resistant schizophrenia,"['Wildschut, Julia']","['Boks, Marco']",2023-06-08T23:00:48Z,EN,['Schizophrenia; DNA methylation; clozapine; prediction'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a worldwide prevalence of up to 1.5%. Around 30% of schizophrenia patients can be classified as treatment-resistant, meaning they do not respond to at least two different antipsychotics. Clozapine is the only antipsychotic that has been proved to effectively treat psychotic symptoms in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Despite this, it is largely underutilised due to issues including serious side effects and lack of adherence. In addition, clozapine has a prolonged response period compared to other antipsychotics. For these reasons, it would be highly beneficial to be able to predict individuals’ response to clozapine. 
A growing body of research points towards the notion that antipsychotics affect DNA methylation and in some studies, such changes in DNA methylation have been related to clinical response. Based on this, we hypothesize that specific DNA methylation patterns are be able to predict individuals’ response to antipsychotics.
The purpose of the proposed study is to identify DNA methylation sites at baseline of clozapine treatment that predict clinical response. To this aim, a longitudinal study will be conducted in which an epigenome-wide association study will be performed. Differentially methylated positions distinguishing clozapine responders from clozapine non-responders could provide a basis for future research on a baseline biomarker to predict clozapine response in treatment-resistant schizophrenia."

Generative runs simulate micro-level behaviours that give rise to emergent macro-level outcomes. To ensure the accuracy of those outcomes to the modelled process, behavioural rules are carefully implemented and their parameters calibrated. Recently, methods for the inverse generation of ABMs - from outcomes to behavioural rules - have received much attention. Most approaches aim at constructing parts of the ABM or require high-resolution data. In this thesis, we use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn the individual policies of a school choice model using only summary statistics of the reference process. A Deep Q-Network is used to learn and encode the recovered policy, which can then be used in simulations. We demonstrate the robustness of our method for the recovery of different latent behavioural rules using different reward functions. We find that our method is not very robust, although it shows signs of learning. In subsequent experiments, we show that the recovered policies generalise better than a baseline random agent, but the learned behaviour only partially matches the reference. We speculate on two critical obstacles to the performance that future research should address."

This study examined the work outcomes of 11 individuals with a physical, cognitive or psychological disability who participated in the pilot and filled out a total of 55 daily questionnaires. The study used Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory to understand the processes involved in the pilot program. A mixed methods approach, including quantitative daily diary design and qualitative methods, was used to assess the impact of the FBTJ-pilot. The results showed that positive experiences with sailing were linked to higher self-efficacy and improved body image. However, career training did not have a significant impact on workability and job searching self-efficacy, even after considering self-efficacy, self-esteem, and body image as mediators. Nevertheless, a positive linear trend over time was observed for both work ability and job-seeking self-efficacy. Moreover, sailing experience and the presence of career training were associated with higher work ability. This indicates that the FBTJ-program has beneficial effects. Continued implementation of the FBTJ-pilot program can help more individuals with disabilities who feel distanced from the labour market. Further research is needed to explore additional variables, such as the influence of the environment and social comparison."

Deze scriptie bekijkt de ontwikkelingen van de retoriek in het abortusdebat vanaf deze periode, waaruit zal blijken dat abortus niet altijd onderdeel is geweest van de Republikeinse politieke ideologie, maar als ‘verzonnen traditie’, afgeleid van hoe Hobsbawm en Ranger die definiëren, is gecreëerd om een breder electoraat te trekken.

De Roe uitspraak uit 1973 bekrachtigde abortus als een privézaak tussen vrouw en arts, maar niet veel later werd dit recht uitgehold door de Casey uitspraak in 1992, en werd abortus overgelaten aan de staten om het belang van potentieel leven ‘te beschermen’. Deze beide rechtszalen werden herroepen in Dobbs, waarin de volledige regulering van het abortusrecht werd gedecentraliseerd naar de staten. De historische context die in deze scriptie wordt geschetst rondom deze zaken verklaart waarom traditiegebruik in het abortusgebruik zo veranderlijk is. Door abortus te bestuderen als verzonnen traditie wordt zichtbaar dat abortuskritiek niet een vast geworteld gebruik is van de Republikeinse partij, maar dat het werd en wordt ingezet als instrument om de partij een (nieuwe) politieke ideologie aan te meten gericht op een conservatief christelijke achterban.""""]"
Childhood Trauma Mediates the effects of Genetic Risk for Schizophrenia on Personality Traits,"['Bevers, Bob']","['Schok, Michaela']",2023-08-03T01:01:37Z,EN,['Polygenic Risk Scores; Schizophrenia; The Big Five Personality Traits; Five Factor Model; Openness; Conscientiousness; Extraversion; Agreeableness; Neuroticism; Childhood Trauma; GWAS'],Clinical Psychology,"Schizophrenia is a severely debilitating psychiatric disorder that is typically presented with phases of relapse and remission. Despite being widely known, schizophrenia remains one of the top causes of disability in the world, causing severe personal and societal burden from long term disability. The symptoms and etiology of schizophrenia remain poorly understood, but recent developments in our understanding of psychiatric genetic risk are beginning to contribute to our grasp of psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia. One of these developments are Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), which are a measure of an individual’s inherited liability to developing a trait, disease or disorder. Previous studies have shown that Schizophrenia Polygenic Risk Scores (SZ-PRS) and childhood trauma (CT) have strong associations with the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of Personality. This model, better known as the Big Five, divides personality into five traits: openness, conscientiousness,
extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. This thesis aims to examine the relationship between SZ-PRS and personality traits in a non-diagnosed population, subsequently looking into the possible gene-environment correlation between SZ-PRS and CT and examining the mediating role of CT in the relationship between SZ-PRS and personality traits. The analyses were performed using participants from the Utrecht Cannabis Cohort (N = 910). SZ-PRS were computed from the most recent Genome Wide Association Studies. The relationships between SZ-PRS, the FFM of personality and CT were first examined using linear regressions. Subsequently, mediation analyses of CT were performed to link the pathway of SZ-PRS to the FFM of personality. All analyses were corrected for age and sex. Our results are in line with previous research findings indicating that openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness and neuroticism are associated with SZ-PRS (B = .083, p = .020; B = -.112, p = .007; B = -.070, p = .039; B = .361, p = .017, respectively). No significant effect for extraversion was reported (B = -.073, p = .079). Furthermore, SZ-PRS was significantly associated with CT (B = .183, p = <.001), and CT was significantly associated with conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (B = -.168, p = <.001; B = -.192, p = <.001; B = -.226, p = <.001; B = 1.215, p = <.001, respectively). Openness was not significantly affected by CT, thereby eliminating the possibility of a significant mediation effect. (B = .026, p = .253). The mediation analyses yielded results that indicate that CT fully mediated the relationship between SZ-PRS and agreeableness, extraversion and neuroticism and partially mediated the relationship between SZ-PRS and conscientiousness. Overall, age and sex displayed numerous group level differences across almost all analyses. Additional research is needed to support the current findings, but our results indicate that a genetic predisposition for developing schizophrenia influences the development of personality traits through the mechanisms of CT even before a clinical diagnosis."

Endorsement of Covid-19 Measures","['Penders, Julie']","['Kroese, F.M.']",2023-08-03T01:01:27Z,EN,['Covid-19; public health; decision transparency; policy endorsement;\ngovernance'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","This study aimed to investigate the impact of two types of transparency, namely decision
process and decision rationale transparency, on the endorsement of Covid-19 measures. A
survey was conducted among Dutch students from Utrecht University, providing them with
information about a hypothetical new Covid-19 variant and ten measures that had been
implemented by the government to combat it. The survey then assessed their endorsement of
these measures. The respondents were assigned to four groups, receiving decision process,
decision rationale, both, or no transparency manipulations. A repeated measures ANOVA
compared the groups on Covid measure endorsement, and looked into their response patterns
across the ten measures. The results indicated that the transparency manipulations did not
have a significant effect, either individually or in interaction with each other, on the Covid
measure endorsement. However, an interesting finding emerged regarding one specific
measure: the communication about (booster) vaccination for students and staff. Contrary to
expectations, lower endorsement was observed in conditions where decision process
transparency was provided, compared to conditions where it was not. This study underscores
the need for further investigation to determine the existence of the transparency effect and its
specific contextual factors. Lastly, suggestions for improvements in future research are made."
The Role of the Five Facets of Impulsivity in Externalizing Disorders: A Meta-Analysis,"['Najjar, Lucia']","['Laceulle, Odilia']",2023-08-03T01:01:35Z,EN,['impulsivity; UPPS-P facets; conduct disorder; antisocial personality disorder; meta-analysis.'],Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"The aim of the current meta-analysis was to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the link between the five UPPS-P facets of impulsivity (Urgency, Perseverance, Premeditation, and Sensation seeking – Positive urgency) with conduct disorder (CD) and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in adolescents and young adults. Search terms were entered into PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO. A total of 13 samples were included, comprising of 6,104 participants. Findings confirmed that higher levels of impulsivity, as well as individual facets of impulsivity, are associated with both CD and ASPD. Premeditation showed a strong correlation (r = 0.50), and sensation seeking had a small correlation (r = 0.23) with CD. Higher levels of all facets were associated with the presence of ASPD, with positive urgency showing the strongest (r = 0.49), and perseverance the weakest (r = 0.29) correlation to ASPD. A moderator analysis of age and gender revealed that the link between impulsivity and CD/ASPD did not differ for men or women, and for older or younger participants. In conclusion, these findings raise questions regarding the conceptual accuracy of impulsivity as an umbrella concept since the results provide support for the differentiation of impulsivity-related constructs. This suggests that further investigation of the five facets, and the acknowledgement of impulsivity as a multidimensional construct is warranted to fully understand (externalizing) psychopathology."
"What comes after death? The relationship between afterlife beliefs, grief and post-traumatic growth","['Mouskoundi, Irene']","['Schut, Henk']",2023-08-03T01:01:30Z,EN,['grief; post-traumatic growth; bereavement; afterlife beliefs; intercultural'],Clinical Psychology,"Throughout the various belief systems in the world three main views exist regarding the afterlife; the secular view, the God-centred view, and the cosmic spiritual view. In the present research study, the potential relationship between these dominant afterlife beliefs and grief level or level of post-traumatic growth was investigated. The hypotheses were that firstly, stronger beliefs in the God-centred or the cosmic-spiritual view are associated with lower grief symptoms, whereas stronger beliefs in the secular view are associated with higher grief symptoms. Secondly, stronger beliefs in the God-centred or the cosmic-spiritual view were hypothesised to be associated with higher post-traumatic growth. This was a cross-sectional study that used three validated, self-report questionnaires to measure the dependent and independent variables. The questionnaires used were the Connection of Soul Scale, the Brief Grief Questionnaire, and the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory. Participant demographics were also collected. The sample pool consisted of 235 participants from multiple countries including Hong Kong, Cyprus, Turkey, Germany, South Africa and the Netherlands. The results indicate that neither of the hypotheses could be confirmed, as none of the three afterlife views were significantly associated with grief nor post-traumatic growth. This matches the literature that found no significant relationship between grief and afterlife belief. One potential explanation for these findings is the variety of coping mechanisms that individuals employ to handle a loved one’s death. The study’s limitations and future research directions were considered."

This study aimed to determine how menstruation affects work engagement on a day-to-day basis. Shame and perceived organisational support were included as potential moderators to assess whether they influenced levels of work engagement in the face of pain during menstruation. A daily diary design was employed with a view to collect data over a period of 10 days [N=101]. Results indicated significantly higher perceptions of pain during menstruation. Secondly, higher levels of pain were significantly related to the depletion of work engagement during menstruation. However, no significant moderating effects of shame or perceived organisational support were found. These findings contribute to the framing of menstrual pain 
as a barrier to work engagement. This barrier carries adverse effects for both the employee and the organisation, with employee engagement representing a source of competitive advantage. Organisations can protect the well-being of their employees by framing menstrual pain as an impediment to engagement and productivity to create supportive and conducive work environments through policy, practice, and intervention."

Results of the current suggest that (1) LO coping (compared to RO and balance coping) was linked to poorer psychological adjustment (PA), (2) dynamic oscillation was associated with better PA, (3) 
culture and ISC did not moderate the above relationships in general, and (4) ISC moderated the relationship between coping and life satisfaction among the recently bereaved (bereaved for < 2 years), with the level of life satisfaction higher for those with a LO coping than those with a balanced coping only among those with a high level of ISC. These findings were discussed in regard of DPM."

The data collected from this experiment was processed using the three steps of coding in grounded theory. The findings of this study reveal that Digital Junkfood can be seen from a constructivist viewpost as users described diverse subjective perceptions and experiences with Digital Junkfood. Moreover, three fundamentals were found to define Digital Junkfood in a constructivist way: content elements, evoked feelings, and behavioral responses towards Digital Junkfood. These fundamentals encompass the diverse perceptions and experiences among individual users. This study contributes to the understanding of Digital Junkfood and its potential implications for compulsive and addictive social media use."
Leveraging Open-Source Data for Software Cost Estimation: A Predictive Modeling Approach,"['Mrvar, Gal']","['Farshidi, S.']",2023-08-10T00:02:43Z,EN,[],Business Informatics,"Software cost estimation is a long-standing research area in software engineering. The diverse array of cost-affecting factors, coupled with the dynamic nature of software development, necessitates constant caution in this domain. Over the years, several strategies and models were formulated to tackle this issue, each presenting different degrees of success and usability.
This study introduces a software cost estimation tool that significantly improves the current scenario by automating the data extraction process from an online software project repository. This tool, devised through extensive research and expert insights, collects, aggregates, and stores project data in a dataset, creating a comprehensive knowledge base.
The automatic extraction and aggregation of project data overcome the manual and time-consuming data collection processes prevalent in the current scenario, thereby enhancing efficiency and precision. It provides an easily accessible and ready-to-use repository for researchers, enabling them to experiment and identify critical factors affecting software costs without being burdened by the data collection process.
Furthermore, our data repository allows for software effort estimation using various machine-learning techniques. Within the scope of this study, we implemented and evaluated four specific methods, offering researchers a launchpad for comparative analysis and refinement of existing models.
The implementation and application of the developed tool showcase its potential to improve the field. By offering a novel perspective and methodology for software cost estimation, it contributes significantly to this research area. Furthermore, it lays the groundwork for future researchers to further explore this domain with ease and precision, indicating a promising direction for the evolution of software cost estimation methodologies."
Gender and Persuasive Messages in Human-Robot Interaction,"['Hendriks, Geertje']","['Graaf, M.M.A. de']",2023-08-10T00:02:35Z,EN,['Human-robot interaction; social robots; persuasion'],Human-Computer Interaction,"In an increasingly connected and technological world, robots have become increasingly more social. Humans have the tendency to attribute human traits to social robots, however, it is not yet known what the exact implications of this are. In human-robot interaction, more and more research focuses on finding out what principles of social psychology and human- human interaction generalize to human-robot interaction. Recent literature has yielded inconclusive results on whether robot gender impacts its persuasive capabilities. In this quantitative study, it was investigated whether the gender of a social robot impacted its ability to persuade humans, and if yes, how. Three factors were taken into account, namely, robot gender, participant gender, and persuasive strategy. In a video-based experiment, participants (N = 231) provided their opinions on robots twice. These results were compared. Results of this study do not provide evidence that the gender of the robot impacted the persuasive capabilities of the robot. Partial evidence was found that a female social robot was perceived as more persuasive than a male social robot. No statistical differences were found based on participant gender or persuasive strategy. However, participants’ opinions on robots improved after the manipulation. This implies that people, regardless of their gender, are capable of being persuaded by a robot. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions that are at play for persuasive robots."

solutions for. Five addictive features have been identified and studied: the infinite scroll, notifications, the typing
indicator, streaks and likes. To develop a better understanding and create solutions for these features, a survey study
was conducted about how people use and perceive these features. This study resulted in an understanding of how
all these features are experienced as addictive to a degree and how they may improve. This led to several proposed
design alternatives for each feature that target the problem areas for each feature. To evaluate these designs, a second
study, a set of interviews were conducted. The interviews generally indicated that different design alternatives to these
addictive features can contribute to decreasing addictive social media use by increasing customization and altering the
level of information presented through the feature, but that one size does not fit all for each solution. The results of this
study contribute to understanding addictive design better and can contribute to the improvement of social media to
make them less addictive."

More head-mounted AR devices are coming to market and a world where we are using these throughout our daily life is becoming more and more feasible. Advertisers are jumping at the op- portunity to use the new possibilities that AR offers. Their enthusiasm is well-founded, based on the ability to alter the user’s view of reality, sensors collecting data about the user’s surroundings, facial expressions, eye movement and more, experts state that AR will be a great persuader. Advertisements are no longer limited to billboards or screens and will be more entangled with real-world objects. Potentially even people could be altered to appear happier when using advertised products. The ques- tion arises as to what extent advertisers should be allowed to go and what impact this will have on consumers. This research aims to tackle this question with a set of ethical guidelines for AR advertising. To aid advertisers in following these guidelines, the augmented reality ethical consumer impact assessment tool has been created. Based on a set of questions that the advertiser answers, the tool indicates which guide- lines are followed and what should be improved to minimise the harmful effects on their audience. With the guidelines and the tool, this research aspires to spark a discussion about the ethics surrounding augmented reality advertising and make a contribution towards a unified ethical framework for the creation of AR technologies in general."

The primary objective of this research is to adapt an existing evaluation framework to enable the evaluation of software testing techniques experimentally. The focus is on redesigning this evaluation framework, which proposes clear metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of software testing paradigms and validate the adapted framework to assess its applicability.
To validate the framework, a quasi-experiment was conducted, comparing GUI testing paradigms by applying the adapted evaluation framework. Due to limitations in sample size, the quasi-experiment does not provide statistical evidence but offers valuable insights and initial validation of the framework. While statistical significance is not achieved, the findings contribute to understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the redesigned treatment. Further research with larger samples and statistical analysis is recommended to strengthen the validity and generalizability of the findings."

Natural Language Processing in Resume Data: The Interplay Between Gender and Occupation on Resume Writing Style,"['Weiper, Maike']","['Bagheri, Ayoub']",2023-08-11T00:03:10Z,EN,['Natural language processing; gender differences; resumes'],Applied Data Science,"Resumes constitute an important part of forming an impression of candidate employees during the hiring process. They are shaped by the interplay between societal, personal, and occupational values. One important personal value or norm that shapes the writing style of a resume, is the gender of the candidate employee (Guadagno & Cialdini, 2007). Previous research shows that women tend to communicate in a more communal way, while men tend to communicate in a more agentic way. In our current society, the feminine gender norms (e.g. care) seem to be less in line with occupational values than the masculine gender norms (e.g. competitiveness; Eagly and Karau, 2002). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, previous research has only investigated gender differences in resumes in male-dominated occupations, like IT careers (Parasurama et al., 2022). Therefore, in this research, we have investigated the interrelationship between gender and occupation in careers that are male-dominated, gender-balanced, and
female-dominated. 
In our first study, we identified the most important textual features that differentiate resumes written by men from those written by women in more than 1700 resumes (Yang et al., 2022). Our results indicate that women use more communal language in their resumes with words such as ""assist"" or ""care"" being the most predictive ones, while the features that predicted male resumes were clearly agentic or pointed out that they are the ones who apply or have experience in higher positions or technical
fields. Examples of those words are ""manager"" or ""engineering"".
In a second study, we tested multiple machine learning algorithms to predict gender from the resume texts in different occupations. We found that all models can predict gender from the resume text. The traditional and word-embedding models alongside DistilBERT perform well in balanced occupations but fall short when the data was more female- or male-dominated.
RoBERTa and Longformer showed steady performance across all occupations demonstrating the capabilities of newer transformer models.
In our third study, we investigated to what extent men and women conform to their respective gender norms and whether this differs across occupations. We found that women communicate significantly less gender congruently in male-dominated occupations compared to gender-balanced and female-dominated occupations. Similarly, men communicate significantly less gender-congruently in female-dominated occupations compared to gender-balanced and male-dominated occupations. Thus, even though people might experience social and economic penalties if they communicate in a gender-incongruent way, they still use a different communication style depending on the occupational context to which they apply.
To sum up, in this research project, we successfully trained multiple machine learning algorithms to predict gender from textual features in resumes. We found that their performances and predictive scores differ across occupations. In our discussion, we discuss the implications of these results with regard to societal norms and values surrounding gender and occupation and how these influence the hiring process. We argue that our results highlight the need for gender- and context-aware tools to help
employers in selecting appropriate candidates for hiring in a fair manner."
Promoters and detractors: Exploring what horse owners appreciate in equine veterinary practice,"['Loerakker, Meagan']","['Gatt, A.']",2023-08-11T00:03:05Z,EN,"['Equine veterinary medicine, client satisfaction, term frequency-inverse document frequency, k-means clustering, latent dirichlet allocation, topic detection, frameworks for equine veterinary client satisfaction']",Applied Data Science,"In the field of veterinary medicine, it remains unclear what clients find essential in order to remain satisfied with their veterinarian’s services. Moreover, it is argued that clients’ expectations may differ depending on the kind of animal they own, and that aspects like communication are vital for the client-veterinarian relationship. However, there is a lack of knowledge on what clients expect from their veterinarian, which can result in dissatisfaction with the provided service. In other words, there is no theoretical framework that describes what skills or knowledge a veterinarian should rely on in particular scenarios with a client. To fill this research gap, I performed several data analyses through natural language processing on the data from a survey taken by horse owners from the Netherlands and the United States. In this study, I conduct topic detection analysis on several open ended questions from a survey with the goal to identify what clients appreciate in their veterinarian, including the potential reasons why a client may leave a veterinarian’s service. First, the data is pre-processed to eliminate dispensable words to optimise the analysis. Second, an exploratory data analysis is conducted in order to get an overview of the participants that were recruited for the study, such as their demographics, the purposes for which they have horses in their care, and the number of times they require a veterinarian’s services. Next, I use term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to create word clouds in order to get a general overview of trends in the data. Furthermore, k-means clustering and the topic modeling method named Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are used to identify the most essential topics and themes from the data. Lastly, these clusters were manually evaluated in order to detect the themes present in the data. Through affinity diagramming and colour coding all the words in the clusters, I constructed frameworks according to Elte et al.’s [31] categories, which describe the varying kinds of client requirements and to what extent they overlap. I highlight several limitations of my chosen analysis methods. Additionally, I pose several future research directions based on the study’s findings."

Within the context of this study, a consensus on the types of variables that are informative can be discerned. That is, the results suggest the importance of variables related to employment, education level, domicile, and household and partner information. Limitations remain in accounting for the researcher degrees of freedom and the missing data in the observed variables, indicating the relevance of conducting similar, additional analyses to get a more robust collection of essential predictors. Nevertheless, this study provides an initial set of important predictors in the context of social science-related data and shows that multiverse analysis can adequately guide the process of identifying predictors of non-response by enabling flexibility in the construction and deployment of a set of models, rendering it easy to implement in di↵erent domains."

Predicting Negative Ties in Social Networks,"['Repopoulos, Sofoklis']","['Garcia Bernardo, Javier']",2023-08-11T00:03:13Z,EN,[],Applied Data Science,"Social networks play a pivotal role in connecting individuals and fostering interactions
in various domains. They serve as platforms for communication, information
sharing, and community building. Predicting the nature of relationships,
specifically negative ties, within social networks has garnered significant attention
due to its potential impact on user experiences and network dynamics. This
study focuses on the prediction of negative ties in social networks, specifically
in the context of the labeled Wikipedia Requests for Adminship online social
network. Three distinct models are employed to accomplish this task. Firstly,
a Light Gradient Boosting Model (LGBM) utilizes graph topology attributes to
make predictions. The LGBM leverages the structural characteristics of the network,
such as node centrality and connectivity, to identify negative ties.
Secondly, a DistilBert language model is employed to process text data between
users and their corresponding vote labels. The DistilBert model captures
the semantic information embedded within the textual interactions, allowing
for a more nuanced understanding of user sentiments and intentions. Finally,
a Stacking Ensemble Model is employed to combine the predictions from the
LGBM and DistilBert models. The Stacking Ensemble Model aggregates the
predictions of the base models and employs a meta-learner to make the final
predictions. Performance evaluation measures, including accuracy, precision,
recall, F1-score, and elements of the confusion matrix, are used to assess the
models’ predictive capabilities. Presently, all models exhibit strong performance
in detecting positive and negative signed links within the network. Notably,
the DistilBert and Stacking Ensemble models consistently demonstrate superior
performance across all classes. Future research should focus on addressing class

Er is gebruik gemaakt van een cross-sectioneel onderzoeksdesign waarbij 85 Nederlandse adolescenten in de leeftijd van 16 tot 18 jaar een online vragenlijst hebben ingevuld via Qualtrics. Een mediatie-analyse werd uitgevoerd met behulp van de PROCESS-macro in SPSS. De resultaten suggereren dat er geen verband bestaat tussen passief socialmediagebruik en lichaamsbeeld. Echter, het indirecte verband was wel significant. Dit laat zien dat meer passief socialmediagebruik meer opwaartse sociale vergelijking voorspelt, wat op zijn beurt een negatiever lichaamsbeeld voorspelt. Deze bevindingen benadrukken het belang van het focussen op opwaartse sociale vergelijking als een cruciale factor in preventie en interventie."

In QuAnGIS the annotations are currently done manually, however, it is a complex and timeconsuming process. In this project, we check ‘How do Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE)
models help with automated annotation of GIS workflows?’. We test RESCAL and ConvE
models and how they behave with geo-specific data. The aim is to check if automatic annotation
with use of KGE models is even possible, and if so, what method would be the best. Some of the
results were positive in terms of tail prediction and evaluation metrics. Despite that, the automatic
annotation is rather challenging, with the current state of the data used in QuAnGIS project."

leading to infertility. For such patients, it may be beneficial to remove parts of their gonads and freeze them in order to
reimplant them later after the cancer therapy has ended. For example, women can have their ovaries frozen, or oocytes can 
be extracted from the ovaries and then frozen and stored to be used later with IVF. This is problematic in young female cancer 
patients whose ovaries have not yet undergone puberty because their ovaries do not produce ovulatory follicles yet and there 
are no mature, competent oocytes to vitrify. Recently, advancements have been made in the in vitro follicle culture of human 
oocytes. This is the process where immature follicles are cultured in special media in the presence of specific hormones outside 
of the body, eventually allowing the development of a mature, fertile oocyte from an immature follicle after IVM of the antral 
follicle. This has already been well described in mice, where fertile offspring have been produced from oocytes generated

with human oocytes.
Combining the currently available knowledge, we will develop and refine a protocol to first culture primordial follicles which 
are present in pediatric ovaries, and then mature the oocytes in vitro to a state that resembles the oocytes found in vivo 
following ovulation. For this purpose, we will be working with frozen material obtained from young female cancer patients. 
We will use hormones to stimulate the primordial follicles to grow, after which we will apply pressure to obtain the oocyte 
and its surrounding cells from the cultured follicle. We will then culture the oocyte in a special medium together with different 
combinations of hormones to evaluate which combination works the best. Alternatively, we will isolate the hormone 
producing cells from adult human ovaria and culture them together with primordial follicles. This will simulate the in vivo 
environment of adult human ovaries, thereby stimulating the primordial follicles obtained from the pediatric patients to grow 
and become ovulatory.
The information obtained will have paved the way for fertility preservation of female pediatric cancer survivors, which is a 
currently unmet medical need. Our research will also significantly contribute to this research field, enhancing our 
understanding of the way that immature human oocytes develop into fertile reproductive cells. This can in turn lead to further 
advances, enabling us to provide novel fertility therapies for infertile persons."

Contrary to what was expected, the indirect effect of remote working to burnout through
workplace FOMO was not confirmed. Nevertheless, the indirect effect of quantitative workload
to burnout through workplace FOMO was supported. Finally, according to the results, the
moderating role of self-efficacy to the relationship between workplace FOMO and burnout was
not confirmed for the hypothesized direction, indicating a positive moderation effect instead of a

Traditional gender norms associate men with the role of primary breadwinner and women with the role of caregiver, contributing to the experience of career-home conflict which is reported to be higher for women. In this study, we aim to explore how career ambition is impacted by men and women’s relative status compared to their partner and if this is qualified by their experienced career-home conflicts. Furthermore, we tested whether especially women with higher status than their partner experience career-home conflicts, resulting in lower reported ambition. The findings of this study (N = 209) indicated that women who have higher relative status compared to their partner report higher career ambition. However, we did not find an effect of relative status on career ambition for men. Contrary to our predictions, career-home conflicts did not moderate the association between relative status and career ambition, and there were no gender differences. Overall, the results imply that the relationship between relative status, career-home conflict, and career ambition is not significantly different for men and women. In the discussion section, it is shown how these findings contribute to a better understanding of heterosexual couples’ dynamics and how to address and understand better career-home conflict."

It is now believed that AI can be used effectively in marketing, because the technique functions as it is intended. However, the side of the consumer has never been taken into consideration. Marketing nowadays relies on the input from consumers, making them important for the effectivity of the marketing strategy. This means consumers eventually decide whether AI can be used effectively in marketing or not. That is why this research has looked at the attitudes of consumers towards predictions made by an algorithm in comparison to predictions made by a human. To test this a survey was used in which different outfits were shown and paired with either the label made by an algorithm or the label made by a human fashion expert. Subsequently the liking, trust, buying and spending attitudes of the participants towards the outfits were measured. The results show that there is no difference in liking, trust, buying and spending attitudes between outfits created by an algorithm and outfits created by a human fashion expert. This could however be explained by the young age and the relatively high fashion expertise of the participant sample. Even though no differences have been found, this research provides important insights into the use of AI in marketing, helping companies to create the most effective marketing strategy so that they get the opportunity to grow."

Op verzoek heeft de ervaren Belgische architect Henry van de Velde een ontwerp gemaakt dat zijn tijd ver vooruit was en ook in de toekomst als architectonisch hoogtepunt relevant zou blijven. Het landgoed werd in 1949 eigendom van de Canadese overheid, maar het landhuis was sinds 1946 al in gebruik als ambtswoning voor de Canadese ambassadeur in Nederland. Voordat het deze functie kreeg, is het bewoond door de familie Wolf, in wiens opdracht het in 1937-1938 naar ontwerp van de Nederlandse architect Henri le Grand verbouwd is. Met het aanbreken van de Tweede Wereldoorlog is het geconfisqueerd door de Duitse bezettingsmacht en in gebruik genomen door generaal Friedrich Christiansen, die bij zijn vertrek uit het huis in 1944 de gehele inboedel als oorlogsbuit heeft meegenomen. 
Vanwege de voorgenomen renovatiewerkzaamheden en verduurzamingsplannen is de vraag gesteld om onderzoek te verrichten naar de mate van gaafheid van het oorspronkelijke ontwerp van Van de Velde en om vast te stellen uit welke bewoningsfasen de onderdelen van het huis stammen. Door middel van een uitgebreid literatuur- en archiefonderzoek en onderzoek aan het huis zelf, is inzicht verkregen in de architectuurhistorische achtergrond en de bouw- en interieurhistorische ontwikkelingen die het huis bij de bouw en tijdens het gebruik door het echtpaar Kröller, de familie Wolf en de Duitse bezetter heeft doorgemaakt. De onderzoeksresultaten kunnen een inhoudelijke en praktische bijdrage leveren aan de totstandkoming van een verantwoorde uitvoeringswijze van de te ondernemen werkzaamheden aan het huis. 

Het onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat het oorspronkelijke ontwerp van Henry van de Velde nog grotendeels intact is. Dat geldt hoofdzakelijk voor het exterieur van het huis. De binnenzijde van het huis is bij de verbouwing in 1937-1938 door Henri le Grand grondig aangepast, waarbij, naast de interieurafwerking, ook enkele bouwkundige ingrepen in delen van het huis hebben geleid tot een herindeling van vertrekken. Desondanks is de vertrekindeling van het huis zoals het door Van de Velde is ontworpen goeddeels onveranderd. Omdat Van de Velde afwezig was tijdens de bouw van het huis en in beperkte mate betrokken was bij de interieurafwerking, is dit merendeels door Helene Kröller-Müller bepaald. Een bijzonder vertrek dat nog altijd de originele afwerking heeft, is de voormalige badkamer van haar echtgenoot Anton Kröller.
De meeste vertrekken zijn bij de omvangrijke verbouwing in 1937-1938 van gedaante veranderd. Tegenwoordig zijn in het interieur van landhuis Groot Haesebroek nog veel onderdelen aanwezig die terugvoeren naar deze fase. De financiële middelen die Daniël Wolf beschikbaar stelde voor de verbouwing waren immens, wat Le Grand in staat stelde om de meest luxueuze materialen te gebruiken. Uit de analyse van de functionele indeling van het landhuis gedurende de bewoning door het echtpaar Kröller en de familie Wolf en de berekening van de relatieve oppervlakteverhouding tussen de verschillende functietypen, is naar voren gekomen dat tijdens de bewoning door de familie Wolf er naar verhouding meer ruimte ingenomen werd door representatieve vertrekken. 
De confiscatie en ingebruikname van het landhuis door Friedrich Christiansen is van grote invloed geweest op het interieur. Door de roof van de gehele inboedel van de familie Wolf, is, los van de persoonlijke tragedie, de ensemblewaarde van het interieur ernstige schade toegebracht. Hoewel er bij het onderzoek weinig details aangetroffen zijn over de samenhang tussen de vaste interieurafwerking en de losse interieurdelen, ligt het voor de hand dat door het handelen van de bezetter een zeer betekenisvol interieurensemble van Le Grand verloren is gegaan."
Navigating in Uncertainty: developing an evaluation approach for transformative innovation policies and identifying conditions for its institutionalisation,"['Wijngaert, Sander van de']","['Frenken, Koen']",2023-08-27T23:00:46Z,EN,[],Innovation Sciences,"Innovation policies are increasingly aimed at addressing grand societal challenges. These Transformative Innovation Policies (TIPs) aim to fundamentally change sociotechnical systems such as energy, transport and food. Because TIPs are generally one of many interventions aiming for transformative change and their impacts appear a long way upstream from their implementation, they pose a substantial evaluation challenge. Current evaluation frameworks are mostly focused on single measures with clear predefined goals and a focus on policy outputs rather than outcomes or final impact, making them unable to capture specific transformative-related evaluation challenges. This study acknowledges the government’s active role in steering transitions and set out to develop an evaluation approach suitable to the evaluation of TIPs and identify necessary conditions for the adoption of this approach by governments. In synthesising transition literature that attributes transition tasks to governments with policy evaluation literature, this research argues that these transition tasks should be adopted as policy objectives and therefore must be subject to evaluation. Moreover, it discusses that it is likely that tensions arise in policy evaluation practices as TIP evaluation asks for learning-based evaluations while policymakers are bound to traditional normative frameworks that favour accountability. 

Four consecutive analytical steps were conducted. This research analysed whether and how transition tasks were evaluated in TIP evaluation whereafter these observations were compared with expert perspectives on current evaluation practices to propose an approach that suits the evaluation of transition tasks. An evaluation approach is proposed that evaluates whether conditions are created to successfully execute transition tasks. To do so, the evaluation approach suggests a reflexive process through stakeholder inclusion that is based on a flexible Theory of Change. Discussing challenges in evaluating transition tasks with policy evaluation experts led to the identification of barriers to the adoption and implementation of the proposed approach. Internal government structures are in place that hold civil servants accountable for their actions rather than providing room for learning. Through an illustrative case study, this research finds that current barriers to successfully executing transition tasks can be resolved when the reflexive approach is implemented early in the policy process. Moreover, the case study identified favourable conditions for learning. Several recommendations are made to legitimise learning within governments in an accountability-dominated evaluation culture."
Otten Reinoud (6460356) Men dare not offer Prayers for them; Perceptions of Suicide in Early Medieval Ireland,"['Otten, Reinoud']","['Petrovskaia, Natalia']",2023-08-26T00:00:38Z,EN,[],"Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance Studies","Suicide is described in the Old-Irish Penitential as a sin for which men were not allowed to pray, yet there are examples in Early Irish narrative texts, such as Aided Chonchobair, Longes mac nUislenn, and Scéla Cano meic Gartnáin, which show self-inflicted deaths in a positive light. Conchobar willingly takes his own life, yet he is described as having a martyr’s death. Deirdre on the other hand is said to have committed a fierce, and heinous crime when she took her own life. This thesis aims to establish what the perceptions of suicide were in Early Medieval Ireland.
There are two texts which are the focus of this thesis, namely a fourteenth-century gloss on an Early Irish Law text found in manuscript H 4.22, and an excerpt from the Old-Irish Penitential. The gloss describes suicide as a form of fingal (kin-slaying), which is condemned in all cases. The Old-Irish Penitential, on the other hand, does consider the motivation for which the suicide is committed. Those who commit suicide out of desperation or sadness, have committed such a grave sin that they could not be prayed for. An exception is provided for those who took their lives in a state of being dásachtach. This can be translated in different ways, but is interpreted in this thesis as ‘a state of irrationality’, or ‘possession by a demon or devil’. For a full understanding of these two sources the system of fingal in Early Irish law is discussed, as well as the origin of the perception of suicide as a sin in the Early Irish Church. By comparing the scarce Early Irish legal and canonical texts on suicide with narrative sources such as Aided Chonchobair, Longes mac nUislenn, and Scéla Cano meic Gartnáin it is possible to better understand the sources. This is done on the basis of the approach laid down by Robin Chapman Stacey."
What Makes You Move? : Affordances for Movement Research Facilitation in Installation Art and Dance,"['Chionidou, Sofia']","['Karreman, L.L.']",2023-08-26T00:00:42Z,EN,['affordances; movement; movement research; art; practice; epistemology of practice; dance; improvisation; installation art; inflatables'],Arts and Society,"This thesis studies artistic practices which facilitate movement research, building on the idea that they contain significant embodied knowledge which is not traditionally studied within academia, as it is non-propositional. This approach is situated within an epistemology of practice, a theory which advocates for the introduction of tacit knowledge in academic discourse and the development of appropriate research methods.

Through this research I explore how artistic practices of movement research facilitation in dance and installation art can be theoretically explicated and developed through the theory of affordances, a perception theory with action at its centre. Employing embodied and autoethnographical methodologies, the research begins with my own engagement in movement research in two cases: the inflatable artworks Thick, Tree (wt) and Awa by Ludmila Rodrigues and movement classes by OFFprojects.

My experience in the case studies is analysed through mainly Rietveld and Kiverstein’s theory of affordances. I adopt their view of affordances as simultaneously material and social and enrich them with critical remarks related to embodiment, to apply it to the case studies’ analyses. This way, the different types of affordances for movement research employed by the artists are detected, as well as the ways the audience is solicited to engage with them. This results in the compilation of a “toolbox”, a theoretical framework of affordances for movement facilitation. This framework is intended to contribute to the explication, transfer and development of embodied knowledge on movement research facilitation in artistic practices."

(N=120) information literacy skills and attitudes towards EBT in relation to their 
intention to use research evidence in schools with a survey. We also explored whether 
information literacy skills or attitudes were the strongest predictor of teachers’ 
intentions to implement EBT. The correlation analyses revealed that both variables do 
not relate to the teachers’ intention to use evidence in their practice. The multiple 
regression analysis model, including research attitudes and information literacy skills, 
did not improve the ability to predict the outcome variable. However, the simple 
regression analysis resulted in information literacy skills as a negative predictor of the 
intention to use EBT. To explain the results, contextual factors should be studied, since 
they might have a stronger influence than individual factors. This study is one of the 
first studies to explore research attitudes and information literacy skills in primary

As a basis for analysis, this thesis highlights how an individual may become more connected to the universe using the key characteristics of the ambulatory approach of storytelling, speculative fabulation and speculative design (with focus on academic scholars such as Debaise, Wiame, Dunne and Raby). For a dramaturgical perspective, this thesis presents Corrieri’s minor and a major dramaturgy as a basis. Considering these approaches, the text draws analysis of Katie Paterson’s A place that exists only in moonlight, which represents and example of how art and cosmic research may interconnect. Comparing Paterson’s work with Tracey Emin and Yoko Ono, this thesis then illuminates on its performative resonance. Ultimately, this thesis aims to show how alternative approaches could be used in order to actively create connections with the outer space and the present cosmic research."

Shells were
imported to the Low Countries via the Dutch East India Company's extensive network from
the Pacific and West Indies. In Amsterdam, Europe’s chief market for mother-of-pearl at the
time, nautilus shells were ornamented by highly skilled artisans and displayed in curiosity
cabinets, where they represented both naturalia (natural objects) and artificialia (man-made
objects). The Bellekin family was a small but prolific dynasty of artisans, best well-known for
this type of work in Amsterdam. The nautilus shells with floral and insect motifs, made by the
Bellekin workshop, will be taken as a case study here. This thesis examines the extent to
which decorated nautilus shells were highly appreciated, partly due to being liminal objects,
which allowed them to mediate between art and nature, blurring and obscuring the boundaries
of the two. Their contemporaries were fascinated with the nautilus shell, not only for its
material properties but also for a variety of other features. As I will argue, liminality was only
one, but crucial feature that has contributed to the shell’s overall appeal. Furthermore, I will
demonstrate how the members of the Bellekin workshop utilized knowledge and skills from
diverse industries to alter nautilus shells, and yet, in the curiosity cabinets, these shells in
addition to artifice also recalled their natural origins. The concept of liminality allows for
pondering how the nautilus shell fulfilled its function as a scientific and aesthetic object in
natural history cabinets, how these objects constructed knowledge of the natural world, and
how they served to reflect a coherent image of the world from a micro to a macro perspective."

Doelstelling: Het doel van deze studie is het analyseren van de opvattingen over diversiteit in geslachtelijke ontwikkeling van artsen die mensen met een vorm van Diversity in Sex Development (DSD) behandelen vanuit een Foucauldiaans perspectief.

Methoden: Deelnemers werden geworven met behulp van purposeful sampling. Met 10 deelnemers werden semigestructureerde diepte-interviews afgenomen. Alle geïnterviewden waren Nederlandse artsen die betrokken zijn bij de zorg voor mensen met een vorm van Diversity in Sex Development. De gegevens werden verzameld in Nederland in mei 2023.

Resultaten: Analyse identificeerde het biomedisch discours als dominant en het sociale discours als aanwezig. Vanuit een Foucauldiaans perspectief kunnen de opvattingen over diversiteit in geslachtelijke ontwikkeling fungeren als een vorm van biopower. Sommige behandelingsoverwegingen met betrekking tot diversiteit in geslachtelijke ontwikkeling zijn leiden tot normalisatie, om het individu meer 'vrouwelijk' of 'mannelijk' te maken. De beschrijvingen van geïnterviewden van diversiteit in sekse laten een zekere heteronormativiteit, lichaamsnormativiteit en sekse/gendernormativiteit zien.

Conclusies: De bevindingen laten zien dat opvattingen over diversiteit in geslachtelijke ontwikkeling een complex samenspel zijn van machtsnetwerken. Sommige opvattingen vertonen heteronormativiteit, lichaamsnormativiteit en sekse-/gendernormativiteit die kunnen leiden tot normalisatie.

Online Timely Bin Packing,"['Khattar, Zhadyra']","['Liu, Alison']",2023-09-06T10:07:23Z,EN,['Online Bin Packing; Online algorithms'],Computing Science,"Within the traditional online bin packing problem context, items with a positive size not greater than one are sequentially introduced. These items are assigned to bins with a capacity of 1 unit each, ensuring that the cumulative size of items placed in a bin remains within its capacity limit; the goal is to use the fewest bins possible. This thesis investigates novel configurations within the domain of online timely bin packing, Online Timely Bin Packing Problem (T-BPP). We introduce a new concept of time slots, whereby each item with a positive size not larger than one is characterized by a release time and associated deadline. Item is available for packing at time slot t, if it is released before t and its deadline is after t. At time slot t, an online algorithm is free to allocate available items in a manner that aligns with its strategy ensuring that the cumulative size of items placed in each bin does not exceed one. Additionally, the utilisation of each bin is confined to a single designated time slot, after which it becomes inaccessible. The goal of T-BPP is to pack these items without missing their deadlines, with the deadline established upon the item's release, using the minimal number of unit capacity bins. It is worth noting that this particular problem formulation has not been explored previously, thus standing as a unique and uncharted research area.

To address this problem, we present the Pack-at-Deadline algorithm with a competitive ratio of 2 and a lower bound of 1.67. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates the existence of a lower bound of 1.2 for the problem."

It finds that the average distance to facilities negatively affects future average income levels on the 
neighbourhood level via the channel of migration; as the average distance to facilities declines, the net 
migration rate rises. This causes average incomes to increase, indicating that rich people who can afford it 
to move, move to those neighbourhoods. In addition, it finds that the provision of any facility to a 
neighbourhood is more important than the provision of many facilities. Also, a retail facility and mobility 
with a car is the most vital for a neighbourhood and attracts high income migrants."

Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures fail to adequately reflect complex native environments due to a lack of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, coupled with the absence of waste and nutrient gradients. An ideal in vitro model is both physiologically relevant and facilitates high-throughput assessment. Numerous technological advances have progressed in vitro models in order to accommodate both of these characteristics, and these can be broadly categorized into (1) enhanced 3D culture techniques, (2) support systems and bioprinting, and (3) dynamic culture systems. The first technological category has allowed the recapitulation of 3D cell-cell interactions, as well as those between cells and their environment. The advent of support systems and bioprinting enables researchers to precisely integrate the ECM, a key native tissue component, into architecturally complex in vitro models. The final category encompasses the incorporation of dynamic microenvironments and biophysical stimuli in order to better resemble the dynamic nature of the human body. This review aims to highlight key publications which exemplify how these technological categories have enabled the next generation of in vitro models. The combination of these technologies may be the basis for achieving the “best of both” in terms of high throughput and high content models.

Future research should aim to address these concerns by focusing on studies exclusively on one institution, to uncover what is working and what is not within an institution, more comparative studies with countries and/or institutions, as well as study a countries cultural differences when comparing institutions from different countries, as this could potentially play a large role in how content is being taught and presented. Largely, this thesis aims to contribute to entrepreneurial education research, and shed light on the aspects from various university programs benefiting their respective student bodies, and what should be done by institutions to further develop this discipline and its students."
A Solid Foundation for Immunotherapy: The importance of T cell subsets in CAR-T cell therapy for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"['Melchers, Kasper']","['Nierkens, Stefan']",2023-09-06T10:07:29Z,EN,[],Infection and Immunity,"B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common form of childhood cancer
worldwide. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy is a promising new therapy for
B-ALL, however achieving long term remission is still a challenge. One important aspect to the
efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy is the quality of the patient derived T cells used to make CAR-T cells. By
nature T cells are a highly variable cell type containing many different subsets and differentiation
statuses. Consequently the T cells that are used to produce CAR-T cells can vary significantly from
patient to patient. The presence of less differentiated memory T cell subsets, T memory stem cells
and central memory T cells, in the final CAR-T product are associated with a more durable antitumor
response than their further differentiated counterparts. Furthermore, while both CD4+ and CD8+
CAR-T cells are capable of antitumor activity separately, they have a synergistic effect when
combined into a 1:1 ratio. Preliminary clinical studies using a defined 1:1 ratio of CD4+ and CD8+
CAR-T cells have produced promising results but still lack in long term efficacy. Both a T helper cell
type 1 and type 2 CAR-T cell response is needed for effective B-ALL clearance and patients who
relapse often lack a type 2 response. Lastly, regulatory T cells in the CAR-T product have been shown
to be associated with a worse prognosis for B-ALL patients but also lower levels of cytokine release
syndrome. A large variety of methods for promoting beneficial T cell subsets during CAR-T
production for B-ALL are being explored, many of which have produced promising results.
Optimization of T cell subsets in CAR-T cell therapy for B-ALL is a promising avenue for future
research to help improve treatment of patients."
Structure based Virtual Screening: Challenges and Future Directions in Scoring Functions,"['Nobelen, Tim van den']","['Moret, Ed']",2023-09-06T10:07:25Z,EN,['Virtual Screening; ligands; search Algorithms; scoring functions; empirical; knowledge-based; physics-based; molecular dynamics; DFT Calculations; consensus scoring; tailored scoring;'],Drug Innovation,"Virtual screening and molecular docking play crucial roles in computer aided drug design. The reliability of these methods relies on the precision of the search algorithms and scoring functions employed. Search algorithms are responsible for identifying the most appropriate ligand and protein conformations, while scoring functions determine the binding mode, site, and affinity of the ligand, enabling the identification of potential drug leads. Despite extensive research, accurately and rapidly predicting ligand protein interactions remains a challenge. Therefore, this review examines the fundamental aspects of libraries, search algorithms, and scoring functions employed in virtual screening and molecular docking. Additionally, it discusses the challenges encountered and explores potential future research directions in this field."
What are the main determinants of export performance for EU-based SMEs?,"['Marossy, Dénes']","['Cernat, Lucian']",2023-09-06T10:02:16Z,EN,"['Export performance, SMEs, Exploratory Factor Analysis, European Union.']",International Management,"The main objective of the paper has been to identify the key export performance determinants amongst SMEs based in the European Union. The study contributes to the discussion of whether internal and external factors matter more when measuring SMEs’ export performance. The relationship between internal and external factors has been first established by using an exploratory factor analysis and found that there is an inverse movement between the indicators, depending on whether they display internal or external characteristics.
The regression analysis of the paper was based on the contingency theory and found that external variables display a stronger effect on SMEs’ export performance, along with factors such as regulation, investment and level of competition in the country, thus being the main determinants of export performance."

Middels een dispositief analyse is er in dit onderzoek onderzocht hoe Burnham in Inside (2021) de afwezigheid van een live publiek opvangt door kenmerken in vorm, stijl en adressering die te maken hebben met vormen van interactie die kenmerkend zijn voor de lockdowns tijdens de corona pandemie. Om dit te doen is er gekeken naar de vorm en dus structuur van de special, naar verschillende stijlelementen als stand-up momenten, publieksgeluid en behind the scenes momenten en is er gekeken hoe de toeschouwer wordt geadresseerd en hoe dit invloed heeft binnen het dispositief. Er wordt duidelijk hoe al deze aspecten ervoor zorgen dat de stand-up kern van de special herkenbaar is voor de toeschouwer. Ook wordt er gezorgd dat de toeschouwer zich als publiek toch deel voelt van de special en er hier een vorm van interactie uit voortkomt die parasociaal is, en dus eigenlijk een illusie, maar die toch connectie teweegbrengt tussen performer en toeschouwer. Ook blijkt dat er aan de andere kant juist wordt gezorgd voor distantie en een bewustzijn van zijn/haar eigen positie voor de toeschouwer maar dat dit niet betekent dat de connectie minder wordt. In de vorm van interactie zijn bovendien overeenkomsten te herkennen met online lockdown-interactie waarin de wisselwerkingen tussen afstand en nabijheid en absorptie en distantie/bewustzijn ook centrale elementen zijn. De conclusie houdt in dat er wel degelijk een connectie mogelijk is ondanks de afstand tussen performer en publiek en de afwezigheid van een zaalpubliek. De vormen van interactie en connectie die worden gecreëerd in dit dispositief zijn geen vervanging voor de normale live connectie met publiek, maar de afstand die de corona pandemie letterlijk en figuurlijk produceerde tussen performer en publiek maakt het niet onmogelijk om toch een connectie te bewerkstelligen."

Tegelijkertijd kampen organisaties met een hoger personeelsverloop dan ooit tevoren (UWV, 2023). Samen leidt dit in veel organisaties tot een personeelstekort. Dit resulteert in onvoltooide taken en een verhoogde werkdruk voor het bestaande personeel. Ondanks deze uitdagingen richten veel organisaties zich voornamelijk op het aannemen van nieuw personeel, maar lijken ze het behoud van huidige medewerkers achterwege te laten (Boerstoel, 2022). Dit kan echter negatieve gevolgen met zich meebrengen voor de organisatie. Zo brengt het vertrek van een medewerker uit de organisatie aanzienlijke kosten met zich mee, zowel in termen van tijd als geld, omdat de organisatie nieuwe medewerkers moet werven en inwerken (Ondernemen Met Personeel, 2022). Bovendien verliezen ze de kennis en ervaring van een medewerker wanneer deze uit dienst gaat (Treams, 2022).		Het doel van dit onderzoek is om inzicht te krijgen in medewerker retentie, organisational commitment en turnover aan de hand van inzichten uit wetenschappelijke literatuur. Medewerker retentie betreft het behouden van personeel, organisational commitment verwijst naar de betrokkenheid van medewerkers bij een organisatie en turnover verwijst naar het personeelsverloop. Er is hier een casestudy naast gezet, de gemeente X, om inzichtelijke te maken hoe organisaties, waaronder deze gemeente, de vroegtijdige uitstroom van hun personeel kunnen verminderen. In dit onderzoek is gefocust op vroegtijdige uitstroom van medewerkers die tussen de nul en vijf jaar in dienst waren bij de organisatie. Deze groep vormde de doelgroep van dit onderzoek.				Om de onderzoeksvragen te beantwoorden, zijn diverse methoden toegepast. Voorafgaand aan de toelichting van deze methoden is een apart hoofdstuk gewijd aan de gemeente X, waarin het huidige beleid en relevante gegevens zijn belicht. Vervolgens is er een literatuurstudie uitgevoerd om inzicht te krijgen in de determinanten die van invloed zijn op de drie centrale concepten van dit onderzoek. De literatuurstudie toonde aan dat er veel determinanten van invloed zijn op de drie concepten en dat er aanzienlijke voordelen te behalen zijn door hier adequaat op in te spelen. Hierbij kan gedacht worden aan een verhoogde productiviteit, minder ziekteverzuim en betere financiële uitkomsten (Rakhra, 2018; Fiels & Bocarnea, 2005; Bodjrenou et al., 2019). Vervolgens werden twintig semigestructureerde interviews gehouden met medewerkers van de gemeente X die tot de doelgroep behoorden. Uiteindelijk zijn negentien van deze interviews meegenomen in de empirische studie, doordat er een ongelijke verhouding was tussen medewerkers in en uit dienst (19 in dienst tegenover 1 uit dienst). Door middel van deze interviews is achterhaald wat voor de respondenten determinanten zijn die voor hen van invloed zijn op het blijven werken bij de gemeente, hun betrokkenheid erbij en het vertrekken bij de gemeente. 									Aan de hand van de literatuurstudie, de empirische studie en het huidige beleid is er een antwoord geformuleerd op de zes deelvragen en de hoofdvraag van dit onderzoek. De resultaten toonden aan dat de gemeente X wat betreft de determinanten op bepaalde vlakken al goed presteert, maar dat er ook veel ruimte is voor verbetering. Bovendien opent dit onderzoek de deur naar diverse mogelijkheden voor vervolgonderzoek, waaronder het onderzoeken van medewerkers die de organisatie al hebben verlaten en het verschil onderzoeken tussen de private en publieke sector."

well as to determine whether SIEs' Person-Organization (PO) fit and Person-Job (PJ) fit function 
as mediators in this relationship. The HRM Perceptions Theory along with the PersonEnvironment fit Theory and the Social Exchange Theory are employed to support the hypotheses 
of this research. Cross-sectional, primary data was gathered via an online survey. The findings are 
based on 116 SIEs from different job industries who worked and lived in Switzerland for one up 
to three years at the moment of the research. Consistent with the predictions of the hypotheses, 
SIEs' perceptions of HRM practices aimed at their cross-cultural adjustment exhibited a significant 
positive association with SIEs’ intention to stay in their current job. In addition, SIEs’ PO and PJ 
fit mediated the relationship between SIEs’ perceptions of HRM practices aimed at their crosscultural adjustment and their intention to stay in their current job. The empirical results of this

De besproken componenten zijn de motieven, doelen en beleidsimplementaties, communicatie en vertrouwen. Volgens de wetenschappelijke theorie hebben deze componenten invloed op het succes van de samenwerking. In dit onderzoek is er gebruikgemaakt van de casus en samenwerking tussen het NHV en de handbalverenigingen. De afgelopen tien jaar zijn er 60 verenigingen omgevallen en is de afname in leden ook redelijk fors (6000 leden in 10 jaar). Tegelijkertijd ontvangen maar weinig verenigingen professionele ondersteuning. Aangezien de verenigingen wel elk jaar leden verliezen maar toch geen ondersteuning ontvangen, of willen, op het gebied van ledenwerving/behoud, geeft dit aanleiding om de samenwerking tussen het NHV en de handbalverenigingen onder de loep te nemen. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om aan de hand van de betekenissen die het NHV en de verenigingen geven aan de componenten van de interorganisatorische samenwerking deze samenwerking beter in beeld te brengen. Uit deze doelstelling is de volgende hoofdvraag voor dit onderzoek voortgekomen:
“Welke betekenissen kennen het Nederlands Handbal Verbond en haar verenigingen toe aan de interorganisatorische samenwerking op het gebied van verenigingsondersteuning en wat vertellen deze betekenissen over de motieven, doelen en beleidsimplementaties, communicatie en vertrouwen van de samenwerking?”
Om de hoofdvraag te beantwoorden is er gebruikgemaakt van een literatuurstudie naar interorganisatorische samenwerking en belangrijke componenten hiervan. Verder zijn er semi- gestructureerde interviews afgenomen bij medewerkers van het NHV en bestuurders van handbalverenigingen. Daarnaast is er nog een documentanalyse uitgevoerd op verschillende beleidsdocumenten van het NHV.
De resultaten van dit onderzoek geven inzicht in de verschillende belemmeringen op de belangrijke aspecten binnen de interorganisatorische samenwerking tussen het NHV en de verenigingen. Zo zijn de motieven van het NHV en de handbalverenigingen uiteenlopend. Het NHV legt de nadruk op het vergaren van legitimiteit en het waarborgen van hun verbindende rol terwijl verenigingen vooral gericht zijn op afhankelijkheid van middelen. Beide partijen stellen individuele en gemeenschappelijke doelen op die niet altijd met elkaar overeenkomen
3
en de beleidsimplementaties worden niet altijd als probleemoplossend, innovatief en continu ervaren. Daarnaast missen zowel het NHV als de verenigingen persoonlijke communicatie en wordt er onder andere daardoor een communicatieprobleem ervaren. Het vertrouwen binnen de samenwerking wordt negatief beïnvloed door de kwaliteit van de beleidsimplementaties en de slechte communicatie tussen het NHV en de handbalverenigingen.
Het onderzoek heeft geleid tot enkele praktische aanbevelingen voor het NHV. Kort samengevat hebben deze betrekking op transparant zijn in de motieven voor samenwerking, meer gemeenschappelijke doelen creëren, aandacht geven aan persoonlijke communicatie en betrouwbaar zijn op het gebied van beloftes en uitspraken.
Tot slot wordt er voor vervolgonderzoek aangeraden om meerdere aspecten van een interorganisatorische samenwerking te betrekken in het onderzoek. Daarnaast kan de rol van derde partijen binnen de interorganisatorische samenwerking tussen het NHV en verenigingen nog uitgebreider worden onderzocht."

This economic gap goes hand in hand with an innovation cleavage that has its roots in its communist past. The EU has several programs in place to bridge this gap: Cohesion Policy and the Research and Innovation Framework Programs (Horizon). This thesis zoomed into two specific funds within these programs to understand what innovative output the synergies between of Cohesion Policy and Horizon funds can have: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Teaming. These funds create and build upon Research Infrastructures, which are critical research and innovation projects needed to tackle 21st century challenges. This research conducted a case study analysis of Research Infrastructures located in the Czech Republic, and analyzed how these infrastructures implemented innovation indicators during the ERDF-phase and Teaming phase. The conclusion argues that the use of synergies between the two programs can enhance the impact of Research Infrastructures, and thereby contribute to closing the innovation gap between the CEE area and its counterparts. Although, a strengthening of the implementation of these synergies is needed to make use of its full potential."

Musea zouden in staat zijn om bij te dragen aan het gevecht tegen de uitsluiting van groepen in de maatschappij. Museumeducatie lijkt hierbij een nuttig middel: leerlingen die normaliter niet naar het museum komen, bezoeken een museum vaak voor het eerst met door de school georganiseerde excursies. Als het lukt om leerlingen zich tijdens dit bezoek een gevoel van inclusie mee te geven en ze te helpen met het ontwikkelen van vaardigheden die sociale inclusie bevorderen kan de uitsluiting van gemarginaliseerde groepen tegen worden gegaan. De vraag die aan de basis ligt van dit onderzoek is: 

“Wat zijn de criteria waaraan een voorbereidende les en rondleiding aan bovenbouw leerlingen van het voortgezet onderwijs in het Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam aan moeten voldoen om sociaal inclusief te zijn?” 

Dit onderzoek bestaat uit twee delen. Het eerste deel is theoretisch en bestaat uit een literatuurstudie. Hier wordt het discours van inclusie in musea en educatie besproken.

However, citizenship comprises a much larger spectrum, and since legal citizenship comes with benefits it is not surprising that it becomes a highly contested concept, as it defines in the context of state policies who receives benefits and who does not. Citizenship in public participation comes along with having a voice in political decision-making for “co-creating urban boroughs” affecting residents' quality of life. In this ethnographic study, I draw on citizenship formation in citizen initiatives through which social identity, claims of participatory rights, civic obligations, and entitlements are expressed. I suggest approaching it as an identity issue that provides an understanding of marginalization by looking into the micropolitics of representation not only produced by the local authority but also re-produced by citizens themselves. This thesis examines citizenship used as a marker for defining who is included and excluded but also who becomes part of its imagination by introducing the concepts of “itinerary of silencing” and “postcolonial semiotics.” Citizen mobilization is not to be seen as only a rational decision, but rather as an affective act shaping the emotional experiences of citizens. Thereby, this ethnographic study elicits responses to affect and its implications on dynamics between citizen initiative and the local authority as well as to the inclusion and exclusion debate within public political spaces like citizen initiative."

The concept of prefigurative politics, which entails the embodiment of an imagined future in the present, allows for a framing of everyday practices as political and radical. Because the communities that make up the social centres are very diverse, a myriad of different futures are simultaneously being prefigured through the radical politics enacted in the spaces. What these different futures have in common is the goal of creating autonomy and fighting against oppression. Through the creation of horizontal relationships, built upon care, solidarity, and support, the communities that make up the social centres try to achieve independence from structures of domination. This way, care can be considered a radical practice through which a more autonomous and just future is prefigured on a small, local scale."

This contradicts the image of the Netherlands as a progressive safe haven for queer people. This raises questions about this image and the identity of the Dutch government. By employing homonationalism, developed by Jasbir Puar, I have analyzed government documents and conducted interviews with people working in the field of queer asylum to explore the interaction between violence against queer asylum seekers and the Dutch government’s self-identity. My findings show that there is a discrepancy between the general discourse and practice. The general discourse, which is mostly constructed in parliamentary debates and documents, establishes a homonationalist narrative. This narrative portrays non-queer asylum seekers as inherently queerphobic and queer asylum seekers as vulnerable victims. The Dutch government is depicted as the savior of queer people. This narrative results in a shift in responsibility. The Dutch government focuses on perpetrators and victims as the sole responsible actors in relation to violence. However, the structural problems in the Dutch asylum contribute to the unsafety that queer asylum seekers experience. This factor in violence is rarely acknowledged by the Dutch government, which is why violence against queer asylum seekers can be sustained. Consequently, the homonationalist narrative is dangerous and contributes to violence. However, in practice this narrative is regularly opposed. Several of the people I interviewed acknowledged the nuanced and complex reality of the Dutch asylum system and violence against queer asylum seekers. Therefore, the interaction between violence and the Dutch government’s self-identity is mostly in line with homonationalism, but also encompasses blurry components that show the complexity of this interaction."""

The implementation potential amounts to 22 Mt CO2 and 29 Mt CO2 for 2030 and 2050, respectively. These results can be used as a basis for further research aimed at quantifying the indirect effects resulting from the implementation each NET.

The Romantic Buffer: The Effect of Affective Touch by Romantic Partner on Itch Experience,"['Zomeren, Nikki van']","['Schielen, Zoë']",2023-09-21T00:00:46Z,EN,"['Itch, Itch experience, Affective touch, Romantic partner']",Neuropsychology,"Introduction: The sensation of itch on the skin starts when neurons called the C afferents are activated. Affective touch, slow touch that activates C tactile afferents, can inhibit an itch response. This study investigates whether affective touch by romantic partner has a greater inhibiting effect on itch experience and if this effect is moderated by an anxious attachment style. It also investigates whether awareness to bodily sensations affects itch experience. 
Method: Itch was electrically induced for 6 minutes during 5 different conditions: affective touch by romantic partner or researcher, non-affective touch by romantic partner or researcher and a control condition where no tactile stimulation was applied. VAS-scale measurement of itch was conducted every minute. 
Results: Affective touch by romantic partner did not have a greater inhibiting effect on itch, which was not moderated by attachment style. Participants with a higher awareness to bodily sensations experienced the itch more intensely. 
Discussion: The absence of the effect of affective touch is most likely due to tactile desensitization, indicating that the method of itch induction should be altered. It should also be considered that attachment style has an indirect effect on itch experience via coping style, rather than a direct effect. Lastly, results suggest that people with a higher attentional focus to bodily sensations experience itch more intensely. 
Conclusion: This study should be used as a steppingstone for future research using a new method for inducing itch and a design that is more considerate to the influence of attentional focus."

to have a positive influence on learning in escape box concepts. This study researched
interventions and their effectiveness to add these three elements. An existing design for an
escape box game was revised to add collaborative learning, immersion and debriefing. The
box was tested with fifty secondary school students. They filled in a questionnaire, and some
students were interviewed in small groups. Also, the teachers were interviewed. The results
show that students do collaborate, but it rarely leads to collaborative learning. However,
there is an indication that creating a design that allows students to work in pairs or groups of
three has a positive effect on collaboration. Also constructing puzzles with multiple roles
might help collaboration. These options may be steps towards collaborative learning. It
seems that the escape box concept, with puzzles and locks, gets students very immersed
and it is possible that the narrative and role-play do not play a significant role. Nonetheless,
both teachers and students like the narrative and role-play. Debriefing is necessary for
students to internalise knowledge, but it is yet unclear what type of debrief would fit best with
the escape box concept. An end-puzzle or assignment to combine collaborative learning and
debriefing would be interesting to analyse in further research. The results from this study
could give teachers a better idea of how to design an escape box concept that is benefitting
for learning."

Intelligent unit testing: how reasoning can improve automated testing,"['Konstantinou, Michael']","['Prasetya, Wishnu']",2023-09-30T00:00:44Z,EN,[],Artificial Intelligence,"The thesis provides an alternative approach to automated software testing. This novel ap- proach is based on an intelligent BDI agent that is later extended in a multi-agent environment consisting on custom and third-party implementations. The BDI agents use logic, reasoning and a rule-based algorithmic process to achieve in-depth coverage. To do so, we introduce a new code coverage and code analysis approach that is based on a control flow graph that keeps track of the visited nodes, edges and edge-pairs.

The purpose of this study is to find whether and in what extend can BDI agents that are based on reasoning and logic, improve the current approaches of automated testing. To determine that, the research aims to find firstly how effective is a single BDI agent based on such symbolic AI approaches. Secondly, the research proceeds to determine how effective is a combination of other approaches, specifically T3 and Evosuite, when a BDI agent is used on top of those approaches. Lastly, the research examines whether this approach has any room for improvement and under what conditions.

The BDI agent and its testing process consist of three main parts: (i) analyze the control flow graph and initialize a knowledge base, (ii) interact with the target class randomly and update the knowledge base, (iii) apply logic, reasoning and a set of rules to construct all possible paths in each method. This process has been implemented for a single agent and was also divided into multiple agents with each one of them being responsible for only one part of this testing process. For the second part of the testing process, the implementations of T3 and Evosuite had been used to determine whether and reasoning part at the end has any influence to the process.

In the experiments the intelligent agent outperforms T3 in almost all cases. When the agents were used on top of T3 and Evosuite, certain cases showed that the agent can improve the coverage achieved by T3 and Evosuite. In fact, the results showed that the opposite is also possible. The intelligent agent can achieve better results when its random testing process is replaced with Evosuite or T3."
“How can SEE niche systems influence sustainable socio-technical transitions?” – the case of the European renovation sector,"['Bottura, Samuel']","['Rijnsoever, Frank van']",2023-09-29T23:00:59Z,EN,[],Innovation Sciences,"The construction sector contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, with materials like cement accounting for 8% of global CO2 emissions. To reduce its environmental impact, experts propose building renovations as a solution to lower emissions and enhance energy efficiency. However, high costs and bureaucratic hurdles often lead consumers to prefer new construction. To contribute to the sustainable transition of the renovation sector, this study proposes a novel approach which combines the Multilevel Perspective (MLP) and Sustainable Entrepreneurial Ecosystem (SEE) frameworks. It then explores how sustainable entrepreneurs in niche systems can drive change to destabilize incumbent regimes. The Transition Model Canvas (TMC) is utilised to guide the analysis of key elements, strategies, and resources in the renovation sector. 

By integrating these frameworks, this study provides valuable insights into fostering sustainable transitions within the European renovation sector. By conducting interviews with pertinent actors across seven regions in Europe, the study identifies a diverse range of strategies employed to enhance entrepreneurial niches and disrupt incumbent regimes, thereby shaping and influencing sustainable transitions in the sector.

The findings underscore the significance of SEE's as potential avenues for driving sustainable transitions and highlight the pivotal role of fostering entrepreneurial agency. Policymakers and stakeholders can utilize these insights to support sustainable entrepreneurship and foster environmental improvements in the renovation sector."

Understanding this interplay amounts to understanding how genetic code manifests itself into cellular function, it is therefore a critical part of understanding the mechanisms of life itself. Recent technological advances have made it possible to simultaneously measure the expression of more than one of these three modalities in a single cell, thereby paving the way for machine learning to attempt the uncovering of these interactions. Algorithms for causal discovery build a graphical model to represent the causal relationships between the variables in a system. However, these methods are usually ill-suited to handle the large amount of variables and the cyclical causal relationships that are inherent to the problem at hand. Here, a two-tiered approach is proposed that first assigns the variables to partially overlapping clusters and subsequently uses an adapted interpretation of the FCI algorithm, that can handle cyclical causality, on each of the individual clusters. We investigate whether this approach can construct a collection of causal graphs that reasonably models the observed data by checking its consistency among overlapping clusters. This consistency holds up for causal graphs based on the same batch of experimental data, but not across data from distinct experiments; leading to the conclusion that this two-tiered approach opens up promising avenues to inferring cyclical causality in high-dimensional processes, but, in its current form, is yet unable to expose the intricacies of intracellular dynamics. Overall, this work can be viewed as a stepping stone towards the ultimate goal of combining all the cluster-specific graphs and creating a single high-dimensional cyclical causal graph that describes the flow of genetic information in a cell."
Understanding heterochromatin redistribution in mouse retina by designing and implementing a novel reporter cell-line in retinal organoids,"['Ivanova, Simona']","['Robin, Catherine']",2023-09-29T23:01:06Z,EN,[],Science and Business Management,"In eukaryotic cells, DNA is packed in the form of chromatin distributed three-dimensionally. This allows for the control of gene expression based on the location of chromatin. Euchromatin is transcriptionally active and located at the nuclear interior, while heterochromatin is transcriptionally inactive and found at the nuclear periphery. This is known to be the conventional organization and is found across vertebrates. However, mature nocturnal rod photoreceptors in the retina have the opposite nuclear organization. Hence, euchromatin is located at the nuclear periphery and heterochromatin at the nuclear interior. The purpose of this project is to optimize and develop tools to study the rod-specific nuclear organization.

The Kind-lab developed the scDam&T approach, which allows for the simultaneous measurement of genomic positioning and transcription in single cells. Combining this method with an mESC-based in vitro organoid system would allow us to study and perturb the inversion. However, preliminary data showed that the Dam-LaminB1 F1ES line could not differentiate into retinal organoids. First, I optimized the mouse retinal organoid protocol and tested multiple cell lines. Next, we generated an inducible IB10-based Dam-LaminB1 cell line. From this we were able to grow organoids which showed all the hallmarks of retinal organoids."

Ideally, accurate images can be retrieved using high-quality fully sampled computed tomography (CT) scan data. In practice, images are reconstructed from noisy subsampled data. One way to acquire good quality reconstructions is to encode prior information on expected image structures.

In this project, we consider discrete (graph) Ginzburg-Landau (GL) functional regularisation to express such prior information. We study the use of graph GL regularisation in binary image denoising and binary CT image reconstruction. For the binary image denoising problem, we examine the influence of various graph definitions on the performance of the graph GL functional. For the tomographic image reconstruction problem, we compare graph GL regularisation with two other well-known methods, total variation (TV) regularisation and simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT), in various noise levels and downsampled projection settings. Graph GL regularisation shows good performance with limited and high-noise data. Moreover, we collect our own CT scan data, and investigate how it might be applied in practical scenarios."

By investigating the short- and long-time behavior of the mean squared displacement (MSD), we show that this model is able to describe a large variety of anomalous diffusion. Indeed, we find ballistic, sub-ballistic, and super-ballistic behavior for short times, whereas for long times we find saturation, and sub- and super-diffusion."

"Andere vaardigheden, gelijke kansen: de bijdrage van de patiëntenfolders van het Erasmus MC aan patiëntactivatie bij patiënten met beperkte gezondheidsvaardigheden.","['Vogelaar, Maartje']","['Doelen-van der Giessen, Jeanine van der']",2023-02-14T01:00:57Z,NL,"['patiëntcommunicatie, patiëntactivatie, gedeelde besluitvorming, ziekenhuiscommunicatie, begrijpelijkheid, beperkte gezondheidsvaardigheden']",Communicatie en Organisatie,"In de zorgsector is patiëntactivatie actueel: er wordt op veel gebieden in de zorg verwacht dat de patiënt een actieve rol speelt in het zorgproces. Dat kan onder andere gaan om de keuze voor een behandeling, waarbij de patiënt actief nadenkt over de behandelopties en vragen stelt aan de arts, om gedeelde besluitvorming te bevorderen. Daarnaast kan het gaan om het naleven van adviezen of leefregels (compliance). Naast motivatie en zelfvertrouwen, zijn voor patiëntactivatie verschillende cognitieve vermogens van belang, zoals gezondheidsinformatie vinden, begrijpen en toepassen. Daar zijn gezondheidsvaardigheden voor nodig. Een patiënt met beperkte gezondheidsvaardigheden is minder goed in staat om invulling te geven aan patiëntactivatie. Het is dus belangrijk om deze doelgroep extra goed in de communicatie te betrekken om zo alsnog patiëntactivatie te stimuleren. Voor goede patiëntcommunicatie is enkel mondelinge informatie onvoldoende. Schriftelijke informatie is essentieel als aanvulling op mondelinge communicatie. In het Erasmus MC is de patiëntenfolder een belangrijk communicatiemiddel. Dit onderzoek had als doel na te gaan in hoeverre de patiëntenfolders van het Erasmus MC bijdragen aan patiëntactivatie bij patiënten met beperkte gezondheidsvaardigheden.  

Om dit te onderzoeken stonden twee aspecten centraal: de begrijpelijkheid van de patiëntenfolders en de mate van patiëntactivatie die de folders bereiken. Begrijpelijkheid is een voorwaarde om tot patiëntactivatie te komen: een onbegrijpelijke tekst zet niet aan tot patiëntactivatie. Door zowel begrijpelijkheid als activatie te meten, viel te achterhalen of de gemeten patiëntactivatie mogelijk te verklaren is door de mate waarin de folders begrijpelijk zijn. Het onderzoek is toegespitst op drie patiëntenfolders rondom de aandoening meningeoom: een veelal goedaardige tumor in het hersenvlies. In deze folders worden ofwel behandelopties genoemd die kunnen bijdragen aan gedeelde besluitvorming, ofwel adviezen gegeven aan de patiënt. Daarmee neemt dit onderzoek twee verschillende aspecten van patiëntactivatie onder de loep. 

De methode in dit onderzoek was driedelig en bestond uit een PEMAT-bureauanalyse, een lezersprotocol bij (ex-)laaggeletterden en interviews met (ex-)meningeoompatiënten. De bureauanalyse bestond uit een beschouwing van diverse items over zowel begrijpelijkheid als intentie tot patiëntactivatie, het lezersprotocol was erop gericht om begripsproblemen op te sporen bij mensen met beperkte gezondheidsvaardigheden (laaggeletterden) en de interviews waren er vooral op gericht om de mate van patiëntactivatie te achterhalen. De patiëntactivatie meten was mogelijk met variabelen vanuit het Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction en het IPDAS (keuzehulpliteratuur). 

Uit dit onderzoek valt te concluderen dat zowel de begrijpelijkheid van de folders als de mate van patiëntactivatie die ze bereiken nog verbetering behoeven om ervoor te zorgen dat patiënten een actieve patiëntenrol kunnen vervullen. Hoewel aan te raden is de genoemde begripsproblemen op te lossen, moet de verbetering voor de patiëntactivatie niet alleen gezocht worden bij de begrijpelijkheid van de folders. Het is aan te raden de begripsproblemen van de laaggeletterden op te lossen, wanneer dat geen negatief effect heeft op patiënten met goede gezondheidsvaardigheden. Daarnaast volgt uit dit onderzoek dat het een nuttige overweging is om activatie explicieter als hoofddoel van de patiëntenfolders op te nemen en explicietere activerende elementen toe te voegen. De samenhang met mondelinge communicatie mag daarbij niet uit het oog worden verloren."
Antibody mining in SARS-CoV-2 spike-immunized rhesus macaques,"['Vries, Liset de']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-03-01T00:00:54Z,EN,"['SARS-CoV-2; Antibody; RBD, Spike']",Infection and Immunity,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of 2019 quickly developed into a pandemic. COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to over 6 million deaths since the end of 2019. To prevent more deaths and to be prepared for next variants appearing, it is important to study the immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies are a crucial part of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2. They can bind to the outside of the virus, thereby blocking the virus from entry into human cells. Therefore, it is essential to study what qualities influence the binding efficiency of these antibodies to the virus, as well as how the development of these antibodies by the body can be induced with vaccines. Here, rhesus macaques were immunized with purified spike, a protein present on the outside of SARS-CoV-2. This protein is responsible for the entry of the virus into human cells, and is the primary target for blocking antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. After immunizations, B-cells were isolated from the immunized rhesus macaques. Each of these B-cells produces a unique antibody. The RNA coding for an antibody was sequenced from single B-cells. Based on this RNA sequence, the antibodies were produced in the laboratory for further characterization. This way, 56 different antibodies were produced. 44 out of the 56 antibodies were determined to bind to the Spike protein. The specific part of the spike protein binding to the human cells is the receptor binding domain (RBD). It was determined that 16 out of the 44 spike binders could also bind to the RBD. Although the antibodies bind to the virus, it does not necessarily mean that they can also prevent the virus from entering the cells. To find out if the virus can still enter the cells, a neutralization assay must be performed. From this assay, it became clear that 13 antibodies could prevent the virus from entering the cell. These antibodies are very interesting to study, because they might help to find antibody characteristics important for preventing or treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we wanted to see the specific site on the spike protein that the antibodies bound. We determined that there is a high probability that 9 of the antibodies have a similar binding site, whereas there are 2 antibodies that have a completely different binding site. Lastly, the appearance of new viral variants is a worldwide concern, therefore it is essential to find out which properties allow antibodies to bind to different variants. Thus, a neutralization assay was performed again, to determine if these antibodies could also prevent other SARS-CoV-2 variants from entering human cells. The Omicron subvariants BA.1 and BA.2 were still neutralized well by 4 out of the 5 tested antibodies, however Omicron subvariant BA.4/5 was only neutralized by 1 out of the 5 tested antibodies (antibody 23). With this report, the description of several neutralizing antibodies induced by Spike-immunization can contribute to further understanding on what properties provide antibodies with the neutralizing capability. Additionally, this report resulted in the finding of an antibody capable of neutralizing several different variants that will be valuable to study in the future."
Uncertainties around tumour-agnostic therapies in Europe: barriers and facilitators of patient access to novel medicines,"['Hattem, Christine van']","['Bloem, Lourens']",2023-03-01T00:00:40Z,EN,['Tumour-agnostic therapies; basket clinical trials; EMA; market approval; health technology assessment; ZIN; NICE; HAS; GBA; clinical guidelines'],Drug Innovation,"With the approval of two tumour-agnostic therapies by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours, a new era of personalised cancer medicine has begun in Europe. Larotrectinib and entrectinib represent the recent advance in pharmacological tumour treatments, by targeting substrates (NTRK gene fusions) throughout the body. However, their stories have not been without difficulties. Clinical trials were complicated by the overall rarity of NTRK gene fusion tumours and specific tumour types. The single-arm, uncontrolled basket trials were reason for concern. Still, both therapies were granted CMA by the EMA, after withdrawal of their initial orphan designations, on the condition of gathering more data to increase sample size, and on the role of NTRK fusions as oncogenic drivers. The complete EMA procedure took 6 months longer for entrectinib, despite PRIME. HTA organisations struggled to assess the added benefit of these tumour-agnostic therapies. To a more or lesser extent, the sufficiency of decision framework, generalisability of the trial populations with the clinical practice population, the use of basket trials, and the absence of data comparing with a comparator therapy formed causes for concern. Still, all HTA organisations (ZIN, NICE, HAS, GBA) recommended both therapies for inclusion in national reimbursement lists based on the tumour-agnostic indication. However, in Germany, the extent of reimbursement is unclear, and in France, only larotrectinib was reimbursed for certain sarcomas. Meanwhile, the European Society for Medical Oncology recognised NTRK-gene fusion tumours as a separate tumour type, possibly enabling the recommendation of these therapies in a tumour-agnostic guideline in addition to the few tumour-specific guidelines. Still, limited reimbursement and recommendations for use may vitiate achievements made by developing these innovative therapies. More tumour-agnostic therapies may be introduced to the European market. So, the lifecycle experiences of larotrectinib an entrectinib can provide pivotal insights in advancing the drug lifecycle for these types of therapies, regarding development, market approval, reimbursement, and ultimate patient access. Here, we review all these aspects for larotrectinib and entrectinib."
A Multimodal Approach: Acoustic-Linguistic Modelling for Neural Extractive Speech Summarisation on Podcasts,"['Çalik, Berk']","['Schraagen, Marijn']",2023-03-01T00:00:47Z,EN,['Podcast Summarisation; Speech Summarisation; Multimodality; Extractive Summarisation; Acoustic-Linguistic features'],Business Informatics,"Podcasts, a contemporary medium of audio-only content, have rapidly progressed in consumption and generation across the internet. Along with the accelerated pace of its popularity in recent years, effectively publicising the podcast shows has become a need for all podcast creators, listeners and streaming platforms. To improve the overall visibility of podcast contents and enhance user engagement, a summary of an episode has become a need for the users or utilising in searching and recommendation systems, which can be a replacement of or in addition to keywords, manual descriptions and transcripts. 

Since manual summarisation for podcast episodes takes ample time, automatic summarisation becomes a valuable task. Specifically, in the context of automatic summarisation task for spoken documents, we need to consider that the extracted salient information relies on what is said but also how it is said. In the wake of this, this thesis investigates summarisation models for podcasts and proposes a multimodal approach exploiting acoustic and linguistic features. Accordingly, we aimed to explore how to automatically generate an extractive summary from a podcast episode in a multimodal way. For our research, we have employed a lexical-only pre-trained
transformer model (i.e. SentenceBERT) for embedding sentences in the transcripts. In this work, speech summarisation of podcasts is defined as a classification task; with respect to that, our purpose was to extract meaningful sentences from the transcribed text where the importance is predicted by combining acoustic and linguistic information. To build an experimental setup for analysing the impact of acoustic features, we have integrated a two-layer multilayer perceptron on the top layer of the SentenceBERT model. Feature projection, ranking and selection were also performed for feature importance analysis of acoustic information. After projection and selection of acoustic features, our proposed multimodal model outperforms the baseline (text-only) and achieves moderately better ROUGE scores; with this project, we aim not to find a complete solution for the automatic summarisation of podcast episodes but to understand the critical part of the puzzle linked to incorporating acoustic features into podcast summarisation."
Cascading problems through the Ramsar Convention,"['Kelly, Elliot']","['Kim, Rak']",2023-03-01T00:00:50Z,EN,['Cascade; decision error; decision making; Multilateral Environmental Agreements; problem shift'],Sustainable Development,"Cascades in which independent failures propagate until a tipping point is reached are common in
densely connected networks but remain under researched in environmental governance on Multilateral
Environmental Agreements (MEA).

Through the use of classical decision making theory an analytical framework was devised, that used
conditions for decision errors as the independent failures that propagated until a combination of
decision error was reached, to tip the system into a cascade. Decision errors occur through the MEA
decision making stages of think, act and observe and included the error of solving the wrong problem
(Type III), the error of not acting when action was required (Type V), the error of acting when you
should not (Type VI) and falsely claiming a relationship that does not exists (Type I). It was theorised
that three types of cascade occur: Cascade 1 (Type III + Type V), Cascade 2 (Type III + Type VI) and
Cascade 3 (Type I and Type VI).

To illustrate the functioning of the framework, it was then applied to an identified cascade case study.
The cascade started after afforestation was advocated by the United Nations Convention to Combat
Desertification to prevent the problem of soil erosion. However this action that was seen in the Loess
Plateau, China reduced the sediment run off and lowered the sediment load of the Yellow River. This
contributed to the eroding of the Shandong Yellow River delta which is a designated site under the
Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat
(Ramsar). This shifted the problem onto Ramsar. However, the problem again shifted to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Ramsar was the central MEA that
connected these problems together, creating a cascade and so this research looked to understand How
do environmental problems cascade through multilateral environmental agreements?

This research found that through states agreeing minimal obligations and then failing to abide by
them, the Ramsar Convention was limited in its ability to identify relationships that caused problem
shifts. Furthermore conflicting perspectives of contracting parties weakened language in resolutions.
This meant that action to designate, protect and fund wetlands based on their ability to sequester
carbon was denied and then delayed by contracting parties. The results demonstrated the
consequences of silo mentality as a problem fell between Ramsar and UNFCCC and meant that
mechanisms were not in place to allow an intervention of the Cascade 1."
The Construct Validity of the Social and Spiritual Items of the Utrecht Symptom Diary – 4 Dimensional,"['Lormans, Tom']","['Baan, Frederieke van der']",2023-03-01T00:00:52Z,EN,"['USD-4D, construct validity, hypothesis testing, PROM']",Epidemiology Postgraduate,"Context
Patients facing a life-limiting illness experience multidimensional symptoms, problems, and needs requiring personalized care. The Utrecht Symptom Diary – 4 Dimensional (USD-4D) is a Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) that supports daily multidimensional symptom management through identification, monitoring and discussing of multidimensional symptoms and care needs. The construct validity of this PROM has yet to be established.

Objective
This study aimed to assess the construct validity of the social and spiritual items of the USD-4D in a population of Dutch patients in the palliative phase of their illness.

Methods
Construct validity is defined as the “degree to which the scores of a PROM are consistent with hypotheses based on the assumption that the PROM validly measures the construct to be measured.” Since the USD-4D does not measure one construct, the construct validity of the social and spiritual items was assessed through hypotheses testing following the criteria of the COSMIN initiative (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments).
This study comprised patients coming from two distinct observational cohorts: a hospice cohort and the MuSt-PC cohort, a national cohort of patients across several care settings. Patients included in the hospice cohort were adult patients with an estimated life-expectancy of 3 months or less and any underlying disease. The MuSt-PC cohort comprised adult patients with an estimated life-expectancy of 12 months or less and any underlying disease in the home, care home, hospital, or hospice setting. Patients unable or unwilling to self-assess their symptoms were excluded. Construct validity was assessed by means of hypothesis testing for every individual item and was established when ≥75% of the formulated hypotheses were confirmed. Hypotheses were literature and expert driven. A total of 19 hypotheses were formulated and tested.

Results
897 patients were included in the final analysis. Of these patients 53% was female, 81% had cancer as their primary diagnosis and 85% received care in a hospice. For every item, at least 75% of hypotheses were confirmed. One hypothesis for the item ‘I can let my loved ones go’ was rejected.

Conclusions
This study confirmed the construct validity on the social and spiritual items of the USD-4D for Dutch hospice patients in the palliative phase of their illness. The USD-4D is suitable for signaling and monitoring multidimensional symptoms and needs. Generalizability to other settings is challenging due to lack of patient outcome data from these settings."

Nearly all complement proteins are modified with glycans. Glycosylation is one of the most common, but also one of the most complex protein modifications. Glycans can play major roles in protein folding, protein orientation, kinetics, and activity. While the structures and functions of glycans in the complement system have been studied broadly, many unresolved questions remain. Developments in glycan analysis methods and functional assays gradually improves the knowledge and characterization of complement glycoproteins in the last few years, but further developments will be required to study this system in detail.

Testing the robustness of the adapted SDG indicator 3.b.3 methodology to determine access to essential medicines for children,"['Mourik, Agaath van']","['Ham, Rianne van den']",2023-03-01T00:00:44Z,EN,['Access to medicine; children; indicator3.b.3; essential medicine;'],Farmacie,"Background
Within Sustainable Development Goal 3, a target is to provide access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines for the entire population on a sustainable basis. Therefore, the SDG indicator 3.b.3 is created to measure the access to essential medicines for the general population. However, there is currently no standardized way to determine the access to essential medicines for children. By adapting the original SDG indicator 3.b.3 to a child specific indicator, a method for assessing access to essential medicine for all children was developed. The purpose of this study is to perform multiple sensitivity analyses on different input parameters that influence the child-specific SDG indicator 3.b.3 methodology to test the robustness of the adapted method.

Method
The historical World Health Organization/Health Action International data from 10 different countries were combined into one dataset with 25 hypothetical facilities which together formed a hypothetical country. The data on 19 of the 22 medicines in the young children medicine basket was matched. In addition to this base case set, another dataset has been created in which more medicine prices were included. With these datasets multiple sensitivity analyses were performed on the input parameters: the national poverty line (NPL), number of units needed for treatment (NUNT) and the burden of disease. The average facility score was calculated to compare outcomes of different sensitivity analysis.

Results
The average facility scores of the multiple sensitivity analyses were compared to the average facility scores of 35,25% (base case dataset) and 68,18% (price dataset). Changing the NPL did not result in a relevant shift (range: 33,62 – 36,62%) of the average facility score. The results showed that using the NUNT instead of units per treatment had little impact on the average facility score (range: 33,33 – 41,21%) and it did not matter whether the minimum, maximum or average NUNT was used. Also, both the base case dataset and the price dataset showed little influence on the average facility score when changing the burden of the disease.

Conclusion
The average facility scores in the sensitivity analyses on the different parameters (NPL, NUNT and burden of disease) do not show a relevant change, so it can be concluded that robustness of the adapted SDG indicator 3.b.3 methodology is proved."
Long-Term Postoperative Opioid Use in Orthopedics: Help Wanted,"['Laan, Julian van der']","['Bouvy, M.L.']",2023-03-01T00:00:38Z,EN,['opioids; postoperative pain; orthopedics; taper; stop'],Farmacie,"Background and Objectives: Opioids are highly effective for treating acute postoperative pain, but evidence of effectiveness in chronic pain is lacking. The recent increase in the number of chronic opioid users in the Netherlands has resulted in a more restrictive prescription policy by perioperative care professionals. Yet, the number of patients with persistent opioid use after orthopedic surgery is currently unknown. This survey was conducted to assess long-term opioid use after orthopedic surgery. 
Methods: A total of 889 patients were invited to fill in the survey. At six months after orthopedic surgery, patients ≥ 18 years were asked to report pain in the operated area (numeric rating scale, 0-10), painkiller use, and opioid use. If opioid use was reported, the patients were asked whether they wanted to taper or stop these analgesics and whether professional help was desirable.
Results: Response rate was 46.7% (n=415). Forty-eight patients (11.6%) were using opioids, of which 41 (85.4%) wanted to taper or stop, and 24 patients preferred professional guidance with this. Opioid users reported significantly higher pain scores in rest and in motion than the patients that used non-opioid painkillers.
Conclusions: Almost 12% of the patients continued opioid use six months after orthopedic surgery.

Long-term User Experience of Children with a Social Robot during Musical Instrument Practice.,"['Awa, Andy']","['Hessels, Roy']",2023-02-28T01:00:50Z,EN,['UX;user experience;social robotics;musical practice'],Applied Cognitive Psychology,"The current study aimed to study long term user experience, specifically when using social robots in music education, the question posed was: does the user experience change in the long term and if so, in what ways? The study consisted of a seven-week experiment, during which 20 participants had musical instrument practice sessions twice a week with a social robot named pepper. A mixed method design was used to gather both quantitative and qualitative data on user experience. The quantitative data was gathered using a modified version of the UEQ consisting of 12 questions, while the qualitative data was gathered using the Memoline tool coupled with a semi-structured interview. The results showed no significant change in the hedonic and pragmatic qualities of the user experience. This means these scales were stable over time. This could potentially be explained by the absence of the novelty effect. A significant change was found in the pragmatic scale, which can be explained by a multitude of reasons including a possible increase in familiarity. Several limitations in the study were present, ranging from small sample sizes to an unequal number of repeats across the participants. We urge researchers to use these results and expand upon them with further studies."
Toekomstvisie Amsterdam 2120: Concept voor de stad van de 22e eeuw,"['Scanlan, Nathan']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-03-20T14:45:16Z,NL,['Urban Planning; Systems Theory; Climate Change Adaptation; Mobility; Ecosystem Services;'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"In the Netherlands the increasing urbanisation will in the coming century be accompanied by several problems of social and ecological nature. These problems are interrelated and are therefore able to influence one another. Thinking of the future can become depressive due to the occurrence of these problems. In order to excite people for the future instead, I have developed the dossier “Amsterdam 2120: concept of a 22nd century city”. This dossier sketches a vision of a city that is able to resolve such problems by adapting to these changing conditions and associated problems. This dossier is in line with the reports “A nature-based future for
the Netherlands in 2120” and “De stad van 2120: natuurlijk!”, developed by Wageningen University & Research. These reports describe possible developments in the fields of energy, water, biodiversity and other fields up until the year 2120.

I combined the methodology of these reports with that of nature inspired design to develop a similar vision for Amsterdam. In order to create a comprehensive view, I divided the vision into a written report and a visual design. The written report describes all the steps of the design process including the reasoning for the made assumptions, while the visual design shows the maps and concepts that were developed during this process.

Since cities can be seen as ecosystems, the futureproof Amsterdam that I wanted to visualise is vital, diverse, economical, and connective. When a city shows all four characteristics, this will offer the resilience through which adaptiveness can be achieved. In order to identify to which degree Amsterdam shows these characteristics, I first assembled information using literature and interviews with experts. On the basis of this information, I specified the themes of the study to climate adaptivity and mobility, after which I performed a systems analysis of Amsterdam for these two and other themes. I used satellite imagery in order to assess the degree of water storage and the cooling effect of each neighbourhood of the city. This assessment indicated that the districts Centrum and Haven-Stad scored the least when looking at these ecosystem services, which I why I decided to further analyse these districts. 

For the assessment of climate adaptivity I investigated the distribution and connections of the vegetation and water within the city, while for mobility I looked at the separate networks for bicycles, cars, and public transport. For the city as a whole and the two districts I then developed separate concepts as schematic maps containing visualisations of the associated climatological and mobility networks. These concepts were then shaped into several designs in the form of renderings and schematic drawings of floating neighbourhoods, paludiculture, and rigorous greening of the public space. I conclude this vision by emphasising the importance of systemic change to ensure the continued existence of the city of Amsterdam."
International Business is still Regional Business: the influence of sub-national institutions on the location choices of multinational enterprises in the European Union,"['Ouendag, Jordi']","['Cortinovis, Nicola']",2023-03-20T01:00:49Z,EN,['Location determinants; Formal institutions; Informal institutions; Multinational enterprise; Region'],Human Geography,"With the increased literary recognition that host countries' institutional configurations represent a key determining factor in the strategic location choices of multinational enterprises. This study aims to deepen the understanding of the relationship between institutions and the location of foreign subsidiaries by paying special attention to the overlooked role of sub-national formal and informal institutions. Therefore doing away with the erroneous assumption of spatial homogeneity within host countries. At the same time, aiming to expand understanding of the role of informal institutions beyond the location determining effect of culture, current research also provides a novel contribution through introducing informal institutions in the form of regional social capital. In following both Institutional Theory and Social Capital Theory, it is postulated that higher quality formal institutions in potential host region provide specific benefits. This subsequently positively influences the number of foreign subsidiaries in that given region. While the role of social capital, in the forms of bridging and bonding social capital, is expected to respectively have both a positive and negative associated with the number of foreign subsidiaries in a potential host region. Applied to the specific sub-national context of the European Union, where regional data in the form of Quality of Government Index and the European Values Study were respectively used to measure regional formal and informal institutions at the NUTS2 level. The results from the quantitative empirical analysis in this study nuance the finding that formal institutional quality unilaterally leads to more inward foreign activity, as evidenced by the significant negative association found between regional formal institutional quality and the number of foreign subsidiaries operating in NUTS2 regions. Suggestive of some sort of inverted U-shape where at some point increases in formal institutional quality are too restrictive to foreign subsidiaries’ operations. Additionally, in providing evidence that a significant relationship does exists between social capital and foreign subsidiaries belonging to specific industrial groups (for example knowledge intensive industries), current research also shows the need to specifically look at industrial preferences towards host countries and regions institutional configurations when analysing the location determining effects of institutions."
Finding novel host receptors for Rabies virus,"['Kagenaar, Gwynedd']","['Snijder, J']",2023-03-18T01:01:36Z,EN,[],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"The rabies virus (RABV) is an enveloped neurotropic virus and is the causative agent of rabies disease (Fooks et al., 2014).  The rabies virion is able to infect the host cell through the endocytic pathway by host cell receptor recognition through its transmembrane glycoprotein which forms a spike on the surface of the virion (Gaudin et al., 1993). To date, five proteinaceous host receptors have been identified: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) (Lentz et al., 1982), neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) (Thoulouze et al., 1998), neurotrophin receptor p75 (Tuffereau et al., 1998), metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 2 (mGluR2) (Wang et al., 2018a) and Integrin β-1 (Shua et al., 2020). However, none of these receptors appear to be essential for Rabies infection with viral entry still being observed in receptor knock-out lines. RABV most likely uses a combination of host receptors and other molecules such as carbohydrates, gangliosides and lipids to facilitate viral entry. To better understand Rabies host cell entry, we used co-immunoprecipitation using the Rabies glycoprotein as a bait in combination with liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This approach was unable to validate the previously found  host receptors, however two potential novel host receptors have been identified in VGF nerve growth factor inducible and γ-enolase."
Anomaly detection and segmentation methods using Variational Autoencoders in Brain MRI,"['Guillen Fernandez Micheltorena, Sara']","['Vincken, Koen']",2023-03-19T01:01:01Z,EN,['Anomaly detection;anomaly segmentation;Variational Autoencoders;Brain MRI;anomaly scoring'],Medical Imaging,"Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation in brain MRI. The principle behind this deep generative modeling is learning a model of healthy brain anatomy by encoding this information into a latent representation and reconstructing it. Anomalies can be detected and localized by discrepancies between the reconstructed data and the original input. This technique relieves the need for pixel-level segmented data and provides the possibility to detect arbitrary anomalies. Challenges have been reported in recent publications regarding the sensitivity towards bright lesions and the limitations of commonly used anomaly scoring methods based on reconstruction error and residual images. These issues are addressed in this work by changing the background of brain MR scans, and introducing anomaly scoring methods based on outlier detection, and activation maps. The evaluation of these methods is performed using four synthetic datasets containing toy anomalies varying in size, intensity, and number. The results show the possibility of detecting dark lesions, the potential of outlier detection in latent space for anomaly detection, and the extraction of activation maps for anomaly segmentation."

Long days in the hospital with many different appointments are considered tiring and are often planned periodically. Telehealth is a method that enables patients to receive (part of) their care from home, either via remote consultations or via remote monitoring. A review about the telehealth care of patients suffering from ALS and the barriers and facilitators associated with implementation of this care was conducted in 2018. We wish to determine if the care as well as the barriers and facilitators associated with implementation has/have changed. In this systematic review we included all articles published between 2018 and October 2022 concerning these topics, and extracted the barriers and facilitators. These were placed in the CFIR framework for implementation.
Use of telehealth is more widespread than in 2018, when patients receiving ventilation benefited most. All patients can now potentially benefit from telehealth. Telehealth is, like in 2018, given in two different ways. Via remote consultations and via remote monitoring. While some experimentations with remote monitoring are starting up, for example remote monitoring of diet, no big new ways of remote monitoring are implemented. Facilitators are mostly seen in the individual characteristics category and the relative advantage construct. Patients find that telehealth decreases disease- and care burden. Fewer barriers than before concern the healthcare professionals. The main barriers are seen in the outer setting, with problems concerning legislation and insurance reimbursement. In clinical trials a lot of new ways of monitoring the patient are being implemented. These innovative monitoring strategies will surely make their way to the care of the patient in the near future."
Mobility patterns at crossroads?

This served as a source of inspiration for this study to expand upon the (longer term) changes in modal usage patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study analyzed traffic counts of cars, pedestrians and cyclists in Toronto during the pre-pandemic month of March 2019 and post-lockdown month of March 2022. By analyzing the daily modal volumes with daily COVID-19 pandemic related variables and other daily related variables, like weather, population characteristics and road classification, this study will consider how post-lockdown modal usage patterns have changed and what the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic was regarding those changes.

This study concludes regarding the main research question that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant influence on volumes of cars, pedestrians and cyclists. However, the direction of effect differs per travel mode and per COVID-19 related variable while it was not affected by time of day. While daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 significantly predicted less volumes of cars, significantly higher volumes of active modes were counted on days containing (more) confirmed cases. Regarding the strictness of the policy aiming to mitigate harmful effects of COVID-19, the study results argue that stricter policy is significantly associated with less volumes of active modes. Thus, this study concludes that COVID-19 cases had a positive effect on active modal volumes while policy strictness negatively influenced the traffic intensity of cars, pedestrians and cyclists."

Hierom heeft de gemeente de opdracht geformuleerd om de ontwerpeis van 30% tot 40% toetsbaar te maken door middel van een softwaretool. Om dit doel te bereiken is onderzocht wie binnen de gemeente met deze tool zouden gaan werken, waar deze ambtenaren behoefte aan hebben en welke geschikte tools er al zijn. Uit de stakeholderanalyse kwam naar voren dat vooral de landschapsarchitecten en stadsingenieurs zullen moeten gaan werken met deze tool. Voor hen is het belangrijk dat de bestandstypes van hun bestaande 2D ontwerpen begrepen kunnen worden door de tool, maar ook dat ze kunnen ontwerpen en inspiratie kunnen opdoen in de tool zelf. Daarnaast zijn laagdrempelige toegankelijkheid en een hoge gebruikssnelheid belangrijke eisen. Vervolgens is bepaald welke bestaande software het dichtst in de buurt komt bij de eisen uit de stakeholderanalyse. Dit bleek de Hittestresstool van Nelen en Schuurmans te zijn. In deze online tool is het mogelijk om in de bestaande stad het effect van het planten van bomen en het aanpassen van de verharding op de gevoelstemperatuur te modelleren.

kan plaatsvinden. Een probleem wat herkend wordt bij de taalvakken, maar minder 
bij vakken waar veel taal aanwezig is zoals geschiedenis. 

Juist, bij geschiedenis wordt er veel gevraagd van de taalvaardigheid van leerlingen. 
Leerlingen moeten teksten lezen, antwoorden formuleren, gesprekken voeren, 
bronnen onderzoeken en verslagen schrijven. Daarbij staan altijd complexe 
historische problemen en verschijnselen centraal, waar vakspecifieke begrippen voor 
worden gebruikt.

Als dyslectische onderbouwleerlingen worden ondersteund bij het ontwikkelen van
hun taalvaardigheid, kunnen de vaardigheden die bij het schoolvak geschiedenis 
centraal staan, beter ontwikkeld worden. De kans is groot dat dyslectische leerlingen 
de teksten niet meer als belemmering gaan zien en daardoor eerder zullen kiezen
voor geschiedenis in de bovenbouw.

Voor dit ontwerponderzoek is de volgende onderzoeksvraag gesteld: Aan welke 
criteria moet een herontwerp van een bestaand hoofdstuk voldoen waardoor 
dyslectische onderbouwleerlingen beter ondersteund worden bij geschiedenis?

Door het raadplegen van het academische debat en het interviewen van 
verschillende experts op de onderzoekslocaties, zijn er verschillende ontwerpcriteria 
naar voren gekomen, waar mijn ontwerp aan moet voldoen. Deze zijn verwerkt in een 
eerste versie, waarna ik feedback heb ontvangen van één van mijn focusgroepen. 
De tweede versie van het ontwerp is uitgevoerd. Aan de hand van leerling producten

Doel van dit onderzoek was om leerlingen uit vijf havo een educatief product te bieden waarmee ze ondersteund worden om een concreter beeld te krijgen van de historische context Het Britse Rijk 1585-1900. Op voorhand is bepaald dat dit product uit filmdidactiek zou bestaan. Het theoretisch kader van dit onderzoek leverde drie belangrijke conclusies op: (1) de historiografie van het Britse Rijk leverde voldoende aanknopingspunten op om de context voor leerlingen te concretiseren, (2) historische films moeten benaderd worden als bewegende beeldbronnen en (3) filmdidactiek is een waardevolle toevoeging om leerlingen de geschiedenisstof beter te laten begrijpen. In het vooronderzoek is gebleken dat docenten, leerlingen en expert de wens hadden om een reeks opdrachten te krijgen die filmdidactiek zouden inzetten om historische films die over het Britse Rijk gaan te duiden. Deze opdrachten moesten aansluiten op het curriculum, een oefenplaats zijn voor historische vaardigheden en leiden tot concretisering van de historische context. 

De onderzoeksvraag/ontwerpvraag van dit onderzoek luidde: Hoe kunnen filmopdrachten bijdragen aan het concretiseren van de historische context Het Britse Rijk 1585-1900? Deze vraag heb ik beantwoord door een opdrachtenreeks te ontwikkelen genaamd: ‘Het Britse Rijk in beeld’. Dit educatieve product bestaat uit drie opdrachten die gebruikmaken van de historische films The Patriot, Victoria & Abdul en Peterloo. Deze drie films gaan inhoudelijk over de leidende vragen die in de historische context zitten. Deze drie opdrachten hebben elk een andere inslag. De eerste opdracht behandeld de betrouwbaarheid van geschiedenisfilms. De tweede opdracht gaat over standplaatsgebondenheid en geschiedenisfilms. En de derde opdracht kijkt naar causaliteit in bepalende gebeurtenissen uit de historische context in films. 

Deze opdrachtenreeks is tot stand gekomen aan de hand van negen ontwerpcriteria die voorgekomen zijn uit het theoretisch kader en het vooronderzoek. Het product is in de ontwerpfase onderhevig geweest aan drie evaluatierondes. In deze evaluatierondes is het product geëvalueerd op de ontwerpcriteria. In de eerste ronde zijn docenten-in-opleiding, bevoegde en ervaren docenten, leerlingen en een expert geraadpleegd. De tweede ronde is een focusgroep gehouden met leerlingen. In de laatste ronde zijn twee opdrachten in de praktijk getest. Dit betrof geen effectmeting, maar een test waarin gekeken werd of het ontwerp voldeed aan de criteria.

Assessing the quality and scope of corporate target setting in 2021 by food and beverage companies.,"['Beuerle, Joël']","['Wicke, Birka']",2023-03-24T00:00:39Z,EN,"['GHG Emissions, Emission Reduction Targets, Animal Agriculture, Meat Sector, Scope 3 emissions']",Sustainable Development,"Mitigating Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions to avoid dangerous climate change can be achieved with the support of private sector corporations. The largest companies in the Food and Beverage (FB) sector already measure their emissions and set targets accordingly. Yet, reporting and target setting is done with varying levels of integrity and transparency, particularly in the intensive animal agriculture sector. By assessing the quality and coverage of targets and self-reported emissions in the FB sector for 2021, this thesis provides a systematic review of corporate climate action and recommendations.

The method used for this thesis is based on two existing methodologies, one assessing the quality of company reporting and the other estimating the emissions of companies involved in animal processing. To assess the completeness of reporting, CDP and self-reported data from other sources were compared with previous analyses, to present an updated review. In addition, total value chain emissions were estimated for companies that process animal products in order to present an expected target coverage that includes underreporting. This was done using the FAO's GLEAM methodology. Lastly, to combine these analyses into a single figure (12), the growth of the companies was estimated, and the associated emissions were plotted from 2021 to 2050. Three separate analyses of the 50 highest grossing FB companies were conducted to provide these new insights, using literature, growth projection data, and company emissions and target data. 

The results show that the targets set by the 46 FB companies – which altogether reported 1097 MtCO2e in 2021 – cover only 42% of the self-reported emissions. The analysis of the meat and dairy (M&D) sector estimated the total value chain emissions to assess target coverage without underreporting. According to self-reporting M&D companies set targets promising to reduce 59% of their 2021 emissions. However, compared to estimated emissions the target coverage significantly dropped to 13%. This indicates a gross under-reporting of emissions in the sub-sectors, although the under-reporting of emissions by the dairy sector is much less severe. The dairy targets covered 62% (37%) of self-reported (estimated) emissions, while meat company targets covered 43% (9%) of self-reported (estimated) emissions. This difference between self-reported and estimated emissions indicates a major lack of reporting in the meat sector.

These results show that the food and beverage sector still needs to improve its management and reporting of GHG emissions, with the meat processing sector requiring the most attention. There is a need to improve the transparency and completeness of reporting and the integrity of reduction targets. In addition, relevant Scope 3 emissions need to be reported, as their relationship to land use is essential for setting targets with a wider scope.  Based on this research, large companies need to use the influence of their size and reduce the significant amounts of emissions they are associated with to make the Paris Agreement possible."

	The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many deaths and possibly many traumatic losses worldwide. Traumatic losses lead to prolonged grief disorder (PGD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. This randomized-controlled trial aimed to examine the effectiveness of unguided online grief-specific cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in reducing PGD, PTSD, and depression for adults bereaved during the COVID-19 pandemic. This thesis was based on an existing dataset of the completers-sample. The participants (N=65) were randomized to two groups: an intervention (N=32) or a waitlist group (N=33). Telephone interviews were conducted before and after the intervention/ waiting period to assess PGD, PTSD, and depression symptoms. PGD, PTSD and depression were measured with the Traumatic Grief Inventory-Clinician Administered (TGI-CA), PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively. The inclusion criteria were: 1) having bereaved at least three months earlier during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) having clinically relevant levels of PGD, PTSD, and depression symptoms, 3) being older than eighteen. Participants in the treatment group received an eight-week-long online CBT which included exposure, cognitive restructuring, and behavioral activation assignments. Analyses of covariance were performed. Findings suggested that PGD and PTSD symptoms in people in the intervention group were significantly lower after treatment compared to people in the waitlist group after waiting. No significant effects were found for depression."

Hierbij wordt het theoretische concept Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) empirisch toegepast op de Mens en Maatschappij sectie op het Amadeus Lyceum. Er zijn semigestructureerde interviews afgenomen bij zes gevorderde leraren, zij zijn bevraagd over hun ervaringen met het ontwikkelen en uitvoeren van het leergebied M&M. Vervolgens zijn de interviews gecodeerd aan de hand van grounded theory. De data zijn geanalyseerd aan de hand van de vragenlijst CoRe die dient als heuristische lens.
Uit de analyse is gebleken dat het raamwerk niet de volledige PCK van leraren omvat die op het Amadeus werken. De voornaamste reden hiervoor is dat de doelen van de sectieleden niet allemaal passen in het PCK-raamwerk. Er is sprake van extra doelen namelijk integratie, vernieuwing, betekenisvol onderwijs, probleemgestuurd onderwijs en ervaringsgericht onderwijs. Verder is gebleken uit het onderzoek dat de doelen en overtuigingen van de leraren doorwerken bij de ontwikkeling van hun PCK. De doelen van de leraren zijn overeenkomstig met wetenschappelijke benaderingen van het voortgezet onderwijs. Doordat deze doelen van invloed op de verdere PCK van de leraren, wijken alle PCK-componenten af van de vakspecifieke context. Dit sluit aan bij bevindingen uit eerder onderzoek. Hieruit kan worden geconcludeerd dat de vakoverstijgende context waarin de leraren opereren van invloed is op hun PCK. De vakoverstijgende onderdelen van de PCK zijn toegevoegd aan het raamwerk van PCK als een suggestie voor verder onderzoek."
Immune checkpoints in cardiovascular disease,"['Tanja, Anniek']","['Teske, Arco']",2023-03-23T01:00:57Z,EN,['CTLA-4; LAG-3; PD-1; atherosclerosis; cardiomyopathy; immune checkpoint inhibitors; immune checkpoints; myocarditis'],Biology of Disease,"The balance between fast antigen clearance while avoiding autoinflammation is regulated via numerous stimulatory and inhibitory signals, called immune checkpoints. Dysregulation of the immune checkpoints can cause serious immune related adverse effects (irAE), including possible life threatening immune related cardiovascular adverse effects (irCVAE), like atherosclerosis, myocarditis and myocardiopathy. However rare, these irCVAE are also seen in treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer treatment. Currently multiple ICIs are approved targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1 and LAG3. 
Inhibition of immune checkpoints is associated with increased atherosclerotic burden and plaque instability. The immune checkpoints protect against atherosclerosis by inhibiting T lymphocyte activity and cytokine production, promoting regulatory T cell (Treg ) differentiation and inducing T cell exhaustion. In addition, PD-L1 and MHC-II on endothelial cells might promote plaque stability by reducing apoptosis and increasing expression of tight junction molecules. 
In the heart immune checkpoints downregulate the immune response to protect against cardiac injury by reducing T lymphocyte activity and migration. The inhibition of immune checkpoints results could induce life-threatening lymphocyte myocarditis. One of the proposed reasons of lymphocyte infiltration is reaction to cardiac striated muscle antigens, caused by decreased self-tolerance, and thereby increased autoimmunity as a result of immune checkpoint inhibition. In addition, there are some reports of ICI induced cardiomyopathy with IgG disposition on myocytes, indicating an autoimmunity response. 
This review will address the mechanisms behind the protective function of immune checkpoints against cardiovascular disease by describing the direct inhibitory effect on T cell immunity, as well as the reverse signaling of immune checkpoint ligands in endothelial cells and APCs."

Furthermore, because of the increase in unnatural deaths there are more people that experience the loss of a loved one as a traumatic loss. A traumatic loss increases the chance of developing Persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD), depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of unsupervised online cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in reducing symptoms of PCBD, depression, and PTSD for people bereaved during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Method: The current study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) consisting of an intervention group (n = 19) and a waitlist-control group (n = 32). Participants (N = 52) had lost a family member, friend, or spouse during the Covid-19 pandemic and reported clinically relevant levels of PCBD, depression and/or PTSD. The Traumatic Grief Inventory – Clinician Administered (TGI-CA), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) were used to assess these clinically significant levels. Participants were assessed with a telephone interview before treatment or waiting period and after treatment or waiting period. 
Results: Results showed that unsupervised CBT is effective in reducing symptoms of PCBD (ηp2 = .240) and PTSD (ηp2 = .128), but no for reducing symptoms of depression, for people who were bereaved during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Discussion: Unsupervised online CBT could become a cost-effective treatment that is used to help treat bereaved people with clinically significant levels of PCBD and/or PTSD."

DBI and MRCI scores for these patients were calculated by our scripts, and the resulting scores were thereafter compared to manual calculations in stratified samples. Validation was expressed as the proportion of identical score pairs. We assessed four scenarios for imputing the daily frequency of as needed medication for the DBI coded script. Additionally, the MRCI coded script was validated by comparing the ranking of six varying test regimens according to the coded script with the ranking according to the original published MRCI tool.

Both DBI and MRCI coded scripts showed a high proportion of identical score pairs (91.5% and 88.1% for two scenarios of the DBI calculation, and 94% for the MRCI coding). The mean difference between all selected score pairs were minimal. Excluding as needed medication from the DBI computations, led to underestimation of the total anticholinergic burden. Our MRCI coded script showed an identical ranking of the six test regimens.

In conclusion, we have achieved two validated coded scripts to calculate the DBI and the MRCI in large study databases, allowing us to identify patients who may experience DRPs due to anticholinerg burden and medication complexity in large study databases. The actual use of as needed medication is usually not recorded. We propose to impute as needed medication with a median value to avoid underestimation of the DBI score."
Directing in-vitro Paraxial Mesodermal Differentiation of Human iPSCs and Guiding the Alignment of C2C12 Myoblast Differentiation using Photopatterning,"['Balaji, Krithi Vishnu']","['Fledderus, Joost']",2023-03-24T01:01:28Z,EN,['Muscle Differentiation; iPSCs; C2C12; Photopatterning; Alignment; Image Processing; Orientation Analysis; FFT'],Regenerative Medicine and Technology,"Skeletal muscle regeneration is highly impaired in patients suffering from skeletal muscle disorders like muscular dystrophies, volumetric muscle loss or sarcopenia. Clinically relevant in-vitro skeletal muscle models are needed to better understand these disorders and develop personalized therapeutic strategies. Closely mimicking the developmental myogenesis and the anisotropic organization of the skeletal muscle tissue are crucial for engineering physiologically accurate in-vitro models. In the first part of this study, the paraxial mesoderm differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using a non-transgenic protocol was validated. We learned that optimal Matrigel concentrations and starting cell seeding number are crucial for the successful in-vitro differentiation of hiPSCs. The second part of the study aimed to achieve aligned differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts confined to line patterns created by photopatterning of ECM proteins. Interestingly, the differentiated myotubes preferentially aligned with a rightward orientation bias deviating from the line patterns. The angle of the rightward orientation bias increased when the spacing between the line patterns was increased. A protocol to binarize immunofluorescence images was developed in this study. Lastly, the orientation of the aligned myotubes were analyzed using two automated tools, Alignment by Fourier Transform (AFT) and OrientationJ. AFT was superior in alignment scoring accuracy and in providing controllable analysis parameters. But OrientationJ outperformed AFT in terms of diversity of quantitative functionalities. The future goal is to develop a 2D platform to train a machine learning algorithm using aligned myotubes confined to pre-defined geometries and orientations that can enable full automation of the orientation analysis process."
C-KIT receptor on mast cells as a possible target for the treatment of colorectal cancer,"['Timelli, Arianna']","['Redegeld, F.A.M.']",2023-03-28T00:00:35Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"The role of mast cells (MCs) in the development and progression of colorectal cancer has long been investigated. A high density of these immune cells, which are able to release numerous pro-tumorigenic factors, has been associated with poor prognosis. One of the most important receptors present on mast cells is the c-KIT receptor, whose activation is dependent on stem cell factor (SCF) ligand, a major cytokine that influences mast cells number. This has led to the development of drugs able to inhibit this receptor and thus decrease mast cell density (MCD). One of the main classes of drugs are the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that were first developed in 2001. Despite their important role and efficacy, TKIs used so far for treatment in colorectal cancer are multi-target inhibitors which present some limitations.  For instance, the development of resistance and high toxicity due to off-target effects are common. Future studies should, therefore, lead to a resolution of these two major limitations by increasing affinity for the target. One possible solution, presented in this report, could be the development of new drugs belonging to the third generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors characterized by a single target and irreversible receptor binding."
Forecasting SARS-CoV-2 Virus Load in Sewage Using Autoregression Models for Time Series Data,"['Slegers, Fleur']","['Kryven, I.V.']",2023-03-25T01:00:57Z,EN,[],Mathematical Sciences,"Wastewater is a reservoir of human excretion and contains virus particles shed by people. Its analysis can provide information on the prevalence of infectious diseases. In the Netherlands, sewage surveillance has been used as a tool for monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic by detecting and measuring SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in sewage at over 300 sewage treatment plants (STPs) multiple times a week. The result thereof is an extensive data set of multivariate time series. In this thesis, linear regression models are used to model and forecast virus load time series for each variable (STP). We compare vector autoregressive (VAR) models which were enriched with different variable selection methods, based on K-Nearest Neighbours, correlations between time series and principal component analysis. How much the inclusion of multiple variables improves predictions is strongly dependent on the number and choice of variables, on the smoothness of the time series, on the length of the training set and on time between training and testing. A remarkable result from this research is that intermediate number of variables used in the models resulted in largest test errors. We found that performance of the models was worse for STPs with small catchment areas. With this research, we shed light on how relationships between STPs can be incorporated in multivariate linear time series models and introduce three novel variable selection methods for VAR."

Key to make the proposed space likely attractive to UU students is the availability of various, designated spaces enabling different work modes, collaboration, events, and recharging. This unique combination of space and people should create a distinct, inspiring atmosphere, that needs to be felt by students upon entering the space. Therefore, to be successful, The Playground needs to become home to a new, proactive student community that should be encouraged to live and improve the space according to their needs.
This study was the first of its kind to investigate student needs for the new concept of The Playground. It provided evidence for sufficient student interest for the continuation of the project, while also calling for continued investigation and integration of student perspectives in the design to prepare the best possible (pilot) version of The Playground for its opening in the (hopefully nearby) future."
"Graphical realizations of degree sequences, packing multiple colors and random graphs","['Vries, Mike de']","['Kryven, I.V.']",2023-03-25T01:00:53Z,EN,['combinatorics; graph theory; random graphs; algorithms; randomized algorithms'],Mathematical Sciences,"Given a graph, one obtains its degree sequence by placing the degrees of the vertices in an ordered list. We are interested in the reverse problem: How do you go from a list of arbitrary natural numbers to a graphical realization with that list as its degree sequence? In 1960, Paul Erdős and Tibor Gallai solved the existence problem. By verifying a list of inequalities, one can determine whether a graphical realization exists. We continue the research on this question by first determining which lists have a unique graphical realization. We then investigate the problem of ‘packing’ multiple lists, that is verifying if there are edge-disjoint graphical realizations for each list. Although this problem is NP hard in general, we give some sufficient conditions. We also show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time for a specific case, when one packs a list of degrees with a given fixed graph. Finally, we investigate the problem of randomly generating graphical realizations. In 2010, a paper published by Mohsen Bayati, Jeong Han Kim and Amin Saberi gave a sequential algorithm. If the degrees are asymptotically not too large, then  choosing the right bias on the edges results in an asymptotically uniform distribution of graphical realizations. This same approach has been applied to directed graphs and coloured graphs. We generalise these related results by bringing them under one framework for generating random maximum independent sets in a certain meta-graph."
The Role of Soil Moisture in Land-Atmosphere Interactions,"['Soest, Marleen van']","['Baatsen, M.L.J.']",2023-03-25T01:01:03Z,EN,"['Soil moisture; Land-atmosphere interactions, Large eddy simulation']",Climate Physics,"Soil moisture plays a crucial role in land-atmosphere interactions through its ability to divide the incoming
radiation into latent heating and sensible heating. Accurate modelling of soil moisture could significantly
improve numerical weather prediction, but observational data is difficult to obtain. In this research, the Tiled
ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (TESSEL) is coupled to Whiffle’s large eddy simulation model
called GRASP and the behaviour of this system is explored. It is concluded that TESSEL is highly sensitive to
initial conditions of soil moisture and soil parameters. In 6 months of model runs, rain-soil moisture coupling
improves the model results through increased latent heating. Differentiation between soil types in Cabauw and
Gilze-Rijen also increases the model skills, concluded from decreased biases and increased correlations with
observations of surface fluxes, temperature, humidity and wind speed. This effect is strongest in summer and
also influences wind speed and cloud formation. In a radiation fog case study, initialization with atmospheric
observations produced a fog layer close to observations in depth, with the dissipation delayed by an hour. For
this model set-up, it is recommended to permanently add differentiation between soil types, so that the initial
soil moisture matches the soil parameters. Some improvements made to TESSEL should be added such as
the conductivity formulation, the bare soil evaporation and the addition of surface run-off. In future research
the behaviour of the system during heavy rainfall could be studied, as well as the influence of open boundary
conditions and the use of other data sources for initialization."

The present study aimed to investigate whether these findings could be extended to the observation of CT-touch. A mediation analysis was conducted to test whether the effect of autistic traits in females on the perceived pleasantness of CT-optimal and non-optimal touch could be mediated by empathy. While the mediation effect was not significant, autistic traits had a positive effect on the perceived pleasantness of CT-non-optimal touch and empathy. The results suggest that individuals with high autistic traits perceive observed CT-non-optimal touch as more pleasant than CT- optimal touch and that autistic traits in females are linked to increased empathy. More research is needed to explore the influences of autistic traits on the observation of CT-touch."
Evaluating the use of meropenem in hematologic patients with febrile neutropenia admitted to Meander Medical Centre,"['Stuurman, Renate']","['Garde, E.M.W. van de']",2023-04-01T00:00:51Z,EN,['Antibiotic stewardship; antibiotic resistance; meropenem; carbapenems; febrile neutropenia'],Farmacie,"Objective
The Antibiotic Stewardship Team of Meander Medical Centre (MC) instigated a revaluation of its treatment protocol for hematologic patients admitted with febrile neutropenia. Current guidelines advise treating with meropenem for 72 hours, following therapy streamlining guided by microbiological cultures. In order to identify responsible adjustments to the current empiric meropenem regimen, this study aimed to determine the frequency of microorganisms resistant to alternative antibiotics, namely ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam, in both prophylactic and diagnostic cultures.

Study design
This retrospective, observational, single-centre study used a single cohort design and included adult patients with a hematologic malignancy and febrile neutropenia admitted between October 2018 and June 2022. Collected metadata included patient characteristics such as age and BMI, microbiologic cultures, and antibiotic treatments.

Results
A total of 100 patients were recruited. One or more microorganisms resistant to ceftazidime or piperacillin/tazobactam were identified in blood and urine cultures in ten (10%) and four (4%) patients respectively. Empiric treatment with meropenem lasted longer than 72 hours as described in the protocol in 35 patients, and longer than 96 hours in 20 patients. In addition to identification of a microorganism indicating use of meropenem, persistent and reoccurring fever was noted as an argument for continued treatment.

Recommendations
Meander MC can reduce the use of meropenem by changing the empiric treatment protocol for patients with febrile neutropenia. As this study showed a lower resistance frequency to piperacillin/tazobactam, this antibiotic is the recommend alternative. Furthermore, increased awareness of when to discontinue empiric meropenem amongst the hospital’s haematologists would lead to further reduction in their use of this broad-spectrum reserve antibiotic."

security regarding water. The Netherlands wants to supply researchers and consultants to 
countries that lack the required specialist knowledge. Recent Dutch international development 
cooperation has been regarding environmental degradation, by teaming up with developing 
countries to create three water-related Masterplans for development in vulnerable areas and 
promoting inclusive development. The target areas were Beira, Jakarta and Manila Bay. These
three Delta areas shared problems regarding water vulnerability. Threats of flooding due to 
climate change, sea level rise and land subsidence were common characteristics. Other 
challenges were linked to rapid urbanization that led to insufficient housing, drinking water and 
trouble with waste and waste-water.
Through semi-structured interviews and a document analysis, the plan development 
process and the stakeholder influence is analyzed, in terms of needs, challenges and impact.
A comparison analysis between the Masterplans shows the main differences and similarities 
between the target areas and their needs, as well as the changes in developing the plans over 
a timespan of eight years. The stakeholder analysis is used to gain a better understanding of 
the Dutch actors and their involvement in the planning and implementation phases of the 
Masterplans. 
Masterplans can be a helpful tool for reaching water safety and security, because they 
offer good suggestions to deal with the urgent problems, tailored to the needs of the area. 
However, it is not clear if and how the local governments will proceed after the planning phase 
is done. The Masterplans cannot directly be linked to achieving an inclusive society. Social 
inclusiveness has improved during the timeline of the Masterplans, but due to local 
circumstances of corruption and the large scale of the plans it cannot be certain to be a large 
influence for an inclusive society."
The association between active sleep and development of the superior and middle cerebellar peduncles in extremely and very preterm infants,"['Ende, Demi van den']","['Dudink, Jeroen']",2023-04-01T00:01:00Z,EN,"['Active Sleep, Cerebellum, Structural Brain Development, White Matter, Diffusion MRI, Preterm Infant']",Neuroscience and Cognition,"Background: Extremely and very preterm infants (<28 and <32, respectively) are born within a vulnerable period of brain development, often causing atypical brain development at term-equivalent age and beyond. Around 30 weeks of gestation, the brain’s white matter is especially vulnerable. At the same time, the neurodevelopmental process of pre-myelination is at full speed and it is also the period in which the predominant brain activity is active sleep. Active sleep is thought to be an important driver of white matter development, a sleep stage dominated by large amounts of non-reflexive body movements, called twitches. Rodent studies have shown neural circuits are activated during twitches, providing a sensory feedback loop in which the cerebellum plays an important role. This led to the hypothesis that active sleep contributes to development of the cerebellar tracts. This study aimed to test if more active sleep at 30 weeks post-menstrual age, would lead to more advanced maturation of the superior and middle cerebellar peduncle. 
Method: In total 56 preterm infants with a gestational age at birth of 24+4 to 29+4 participated in this study. Sleep was measured around 30 weeks post-menstrual age (5-7 consecutive days) based on heartrate and respiratory rate, and an average percentage of sleep stages per 24 hours was calculated. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were used to indicate maturation of the tracts at 40 weeks post-menstrual age, calculated using region-of-interest analysis on diffusion-tensor-imaging data. 
Results: Active sleep covered 44.87 percent of the total sleep time. Active sleep did not significantly predict fractional anisotropy, nor mean diffusivity for the superior and middle cerebellar peduncles. The covariate days on ventilation was found to be significant predictor for fractional anisotropy values of the middle cerebellar peduncle (β = -0.04, p = .014, R2 = 0.02). 
Conclusion: The present study could not predict maturation of the cerebellar tracts by active sleep around 30 weeks post-menstrual age. As this was the first human study on this specific topic, this study should be replicated preferably also including automated region-of-interest analysis."
The imperfect co-production of security: tracing the emergence and development of community-based armed groups in Mali & Burkina Faso between the 1990s and 2022,"['Voorthuizen, Paula van']","['Lenfant, Francois']",2023-04-01T00:01:02Z,EN,['community-based armed groups; self-defense ; security; hybrid governance; Sahel; Mali; Burkina Faso'],Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"The year 2022 marks the tenth anniversary of violent conflict in the central Sahel, characterized by escalating and increasingly generalized violence. So-called self-defense groups are taking on a growing role in Burkina Faso’s and Mali’s security landscape, as both states are struggling to counter a “jihadist” insurgency. Based on a literature review complemented by several expert interviews, this thesis contextualizes the current proliferation of these groups by examining their emergence and development since the 1990s through the typology of community-based armed groups. It demonstrates that such groups in Mali and Burkina Faso have developed as co-providers of security within a hybrid governance structure, in which the state’s historically limited presence in rural areas has stimulated local communities to form their own security initiatives. Community-based armed groups emerged in the 1990s among local insecurities related to insurgencies and crime, and have since transformed in line with evolving security issues. With their increasing prominence in the conflict with jihadist groups, it is crucial that security strategies in the Sahel are informed by an improved understanding of the role these groups play in the imperfect co-production of security in Mali and Burkina Faso."

tients regarding a certain health outcome (e.g., in-hospital mortality). To develop these
models, historic structured data is needed about patient characteristics and the relevant
health outcomes. Sometimes the to be predicted health outcome was not recorded in struc-
tured data but may be extracted from the textual notes by using text mining. If a text
mining model is developed to extract outcome variables from clinical notes, that model
can be used to generate the training data for the prediction model. Contemporary research
often applies text mining, but the impact of text mining quality on prediction model per-
formances in this setting remains unclear. We performed a simulation study that charted
this relationship in a case study of in-hospital mortality prediction in ICUs. We created
a logistic regression and neural network prediction model and trained it on data extrac-
ted by multiple text mining models with a wide range of performance. We varied the
performance of the text mining models by changing the size of the training data used to
develop them and by shifting the decision boundary. We found that analysis can be done
to determine whether the text mining model performs well enough, or whether more data
might be needed for text mining training purposes. We also concluded that shifting the
decision boundary of the text mining model can be a viable way to increase prediction
model performance, especially when a low amount of training data is used. The know-
ledge gained in this project may be used to create better performing prediction models
using text mining models when training data is limited."

"Towards high aspect ratio silica coated gold nanorods capable of smectic
ordering for Surface Enhanced Raman spectroscopy","['Noordman, Thomas Jan']","['Blaaderen, A. van']",2023-06-02T00:00:56Z,EN,[],Nanomaterials Science,"Raman Spectroscopy is used to investigate the vibrational energy modes of molecules. However, the
Raman signals are 1010 till 1015 times weaker than typical fluorescence spectroscopy. Surface Enhanced
Raman Scattering (SERS) is a methodology that uses colloidal metal nanoparticles with plasmonic prop-
erties to boost the Raman signal by orders of magnitude via electromagnetic enhancement.
Silver particles would give the strongest enhancement. However, gold is used more often as it chemical
more stable and there is an wider variety of available shapes. The shape of the nanoparticle also strongly
influences the enhancement factor. The local enhancement will be stronger at strong curvatures due
to the near field effecs of the plasmon resonance. Because of this, a rod shape is a good shape to use.
These nanorods will have a strong enhancement at the tips. Further, if the local electromagnetic fields
of nanoparticles overlap, they create so called hotspots, increasing the electromagnetic enhancement.
By configuring the gold nanorods in an end-to-end orientation would, in theory, create the strongest
enhancement, because of the linking of the hotspot. A novel way to do this is by creating a smectic-
ordered liquid crystal. In a smectic ordered system, the tips of the rods are aligned as the rods are
oriented the same way and layer by layer. When rods have an aspect ratio (length divided by width) of
at least 4.1 to 1, then rods can form this smectic ordering through self-assembly.
The gold nanorods were coated with mesoporous silica oxide. This improves thermal stability and reduces
toxicity. Further, the silica layer will prevent aggregation of the gold nanorods. To do this, the silica
layer needs a certain thickness. How thick depends on the aspect ratio of the gold nanorod. However, the
thicker the silica layer, the lower the aspect ratio. It was calculated that using a gold rod with an aspect
ratio of at least 6.9 gives enough room to create a thick enough silica layer to prevent the aggregation of
the gold nano rods without silica layer becoming to thick that the aspect ratio of the total particle would
be lower than 4.1.
In this thesis, gold nanorods were achieved with various aspect ratios ranging from 2.2 to 5.6 via the Ye
& Murray’s method. Using the Chang & Murphy’s method gold nanorods with an aspect ratio up to
8.5 could be synthesized. However, due to the ageing of NaBH4 or bad stock solutions of NaOH, it was
impossible to create such a high aspect ratio at the end of the thesis.
Controlling the thickness of the silica layer by adjusting the concentration of tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS) is difficult. Another way to do this is by adding 2-(Methoxy(polyethyleneoxy)propyl)trimethoxysilane
(PEG-silane). By adding this chemical at different time intervals during the silica shell formation, the
silica-coated gold nanorods could be created with various thicknesses. Further, it is shown that dissolving
TEOS in methanol resulted in thinner and smoother silica layers. Further, it is shown that the concen-
tration and the dimension of the gold nanorod strongly influence the formation of the silica layer. In the
end, a silica-coated gold nanoparticle was created with an aspect ratio of 3.9."
Determining serologic targets in serum of goat farmers and their employees in light of the Livestock Farming and Neighboring Residents' health - part 3 (VGO-3) project.,"['Dasari, nithya']","['Lotterman, Aniek']",2023-06-05T00:00:43Z,EN,[],One Health,"Background & Aim: In the Netherlands, CAP cases were connected to living nearby goat farms in the Netherlands. Later on, an association between goat farms and an increased risk of CAP for residents living within a radius of 1.5 to 2 kilometers was also found. The potential role of pathogens from goats/goat farms still needs to be investigated as a likely cause. This study listed zoonotic pathogens from goats and compost-associated agents causing CAP in humans, along with serology for diagnosis. The research focuses on farmers and goat farm workers since they are (highly) exposed to pathogens from occupational exposure. Possible serological factors are sought to find the pathogens associated with CAP are presented.

Methods: The characteristics of the microorganisms that could cause CAP in humans originating from goat farms to residential areas are listed that are chosen from yet-to-be-published reports (VGO-III-sub study). After retrieving the list, a detailed search was done with the microorganism’s name and its association with CAP. Simultaneously serological targets in the blood and brief symptoms caused by the organism were also mentioned. Finally, commercially available serological assays for testing are listed along with their costs and descriptions (supplementary).

Results: In total, 16 and 32 microorganisms from goats and compost, respectively, were included. Microorganisms include bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic causes of CAP. Serological targets in the blood are mentioned for all the organisms. Commercially available serological assays belonging to different companies were listed.

Conclusion: This literature review focussed on listing the pathogens in two main categories, including zoonotic agents from goats and compost-associated pathogens. To put this list in a practical perspective, an overview was provided with serological tests commercially available. With the help of these tests and after interpreting the results, a plausible explanation can be established between CAP and microorganisms from goat/goat farms. In addition, CAP-causing antigen panels can be made for testing in susceptible individuals."
Driving Sustainable Development in Spanish Municipalities: The Circular City Index as an Open Data Tool for Policymakers in Spain,"['Wijk, Rens van']","['Lammeren, Ron van']",2023-06-02T00:00:58Z,EN,['Open Data; Urban Ecological Transition; Circular Economy; Circular City Index'],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"In recent years, Spain has made commendable policy commitments to tackle climate change. However, the country ranks lower than other European nations regarding environmental policy and global environmental protection. Urban areas are particularly vulnerable to ecosystem disruptions, and without significant improvements, the situation will only exacerbate. Unfortunately, there is a lack of comprehensive and universal approaches to evaluating sustainable development challenges at city and municipal level. To address this gap, Italian researchers developed the Circular City Index (CCI), which measures urban circularity and green transition based on open data principles. However, the CCI has only been assessed on an Italian case study, and there is a need for universal methods in Spain. This thesis aims to fulfill this need.

This thesis reformulates and redefines the CCI for Spain and evaluates the level of preparedness of Spanish municipalities towards urban circularity and green transition by applying the index. The study uses a quantitative research design with a case study of 8,217 Spanish municipalities, identifying key socio-demographic and economic characteristics that impact municipal performance. The research demonstrates that the CCI is a valuable tool for policymakers to identify areas for improvement and develop policies to address sustainable development challenges in alignment with European targets.

The research findings indicate that population size is the primary socio-demographic characteristic impacting urban circularity, with larger municipalities generally being more prepared for green transition than smaller ones. This implies that policies encouraging population growth and urbanization could lead to better sustainable outcomes. This research aims to fill the current research gap regarding the lack of comprehensive and universal strategies to quantify and evaluate sustainable development challenges at the municipal level and offers insights to assist policymakers in defining policies to address these challenges. The thesis is fully reproducible, scalable, and built on open-source data, methodologies, and software."
"Constructing 'Liveness' on Social Media to establish 'Authenticity'- BeReal, a case study","['Siepen, Alexa']","['Surma, Hanna']",2023-06-03T01:01:01Z,EN,"['liveness; social media; authenticity; BeReal; realness; live; television; new media; participation culture, users as producers']",Film and Television Cultures,"This thesis builds both on television and new media studies to examine the French social media app BeReal as a case study to investigate how ‘liveness’ is used and operates to establish a feeling of ‘authenticity’ for users. With reference to earlier television-based approaches to ‘liveness,’ as well as more recent studies on social media, I situate the app in its socio-political context of a highly commercialized social media environment. Subsequently, I examine how BeReal constructs ‘liveness’ in a manner that serves to create uniqueness next to other platforms, such as Instagram or TikTok, by generating ‘authentic’ online encounters between users. To do so, media scholar Karin Van Es’ approach of understanding ‘liveness’ as a constellation that is constructed through the interplay of the domains of institution, technology, and users will serve as a framework for my understanding of the concept in relation to BeReal. Based on this three-folded dynamic of ‘liveness,’ this thesis argues that the mainstreaming of curating profiles, editing images, and monetization practices on social media increasingly put the credibility of shared content into question, hence also causing a shift in the composition of ‘liveness’ with the relevance of establishing ‘authenticity’ through ‘live’ content distinctively enhancing. Thus, in contrast to Van Es and other prior studies, which identify ‘authenticity’ as a secondary component within the construction of ‘liveness’ in social media, this thesis claims that BeReal’s use of ‘liveness’ is decisively entangled with notions of facilitating more transparency and intimacy between users, hence positioning the construction of ‘authenticity’ as one of the main purposes of ‘liveness.’ Since this altered focus of ‘liveness’ demands a re-evaluation of the concept, I introduce ‘authentic liveness’ as a contemporarily fitting term for this phenomenon.
To prove this argument, the analysis is structured according to Van Es’ methodological approach of examining the app’s metatext, space of participation, and user responses to identify how BeReal constructs ‘authentic liveness.’ The first analytical chapter thus examines how the metatext, embodied by the app’s official website, the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, as well the founder’s LinkedIn profile, externally frame ‘liveness’ in relation to the app. The second and main analytical section deconstructs the app’s participatory space by focusing on how the techno-cultural forces on the user interface, as well as legal and economic forces, navigate user activity on the platform by merging characteristics of ‘authenticity’ with ‘liveness.’ Lastly, the third analytical chapter investigates user responses collected on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store to examine how users understand ‘liveness’ in the app."
The Effect of Spatial Audio on Thresholds for Curvature Gains in Redirected Walking Applications in Virtual Reality,"['Gerritse, Maarten']","['Frommel, J.']",2023-06-02T00:00:51Z,EN,['Human Computer Interaction; HCI; redirected walking; RDW; virtual reality; locomotion; curvature gain; spatial audio'],Human-Computer Interaction,"Redirected walking (RDW) is a technique used in virtual reality (VR) applications to allow users to navigate virtual environments that are larger than the physical space they are walking in. RDW works by decoupling the user’s virtual trajectory from their real trajectory, and is achieved by manipulating the view of the virtual world presented to the user via a head-mounted display (HMD). The success of this technique depends on the dominance of vision in orientation perception. However, there are limitations to how much the orientation can be manipulated before the user notices and the illusion is broken. This study aims to investigate the effect of adding spatial audio elements to RDW in order to increase the perceptual threshold and allow for higher levels of redirection while maintaining a convincing experience. This research conducts user experiments with a population of n=18, under conditions with and without spatial audio elements, to research the perceptual thresholds. The tested curvature gains range of 0°/m, 3°/m, 6°/m and 9°/m, to both the left and right. An increase in detection threshold of 2.56°/m is found between conditions with and without audio, which leads to a detection threshold of 8.7°/m when spatial audio elements are applied. This positive effect on thresholds could allow for higher levels of redirection when spatial audio is applied, while maintaining a convincing experience, leading to more freedom to navigate virtual environments in even smaller physical spaces."
A memetic attempt to vaccinate society against viral going fake news,"['Brink, Jeroen van den']","['Zandveld, Jelle']",2023-06-02T00:00:52Z,EN,['Meme theory; fake news; memetics; innoculation theory; immune systems'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"Fake news is becoming a bigger threat to our society, leading to polarization and disinformation. De ideas in fake news are dependent on humans for their proliferation. An idea must enter someone’s mind, after which this person can spread it to new people. This is comparable to the way parasitic germs are dependent on their hosts for reproduction. Over the course of evolution, the human species has come up with a multitude of strong defenses against germs. Therefore, in this writing assignment, our defense mechanisms against germs are examined in order to find new ways to protect ourselves against the spreading of fake news. To this extend, four corresponding essential elements in the transfer of both ideas and germs were revealed. In order for an infection to occur, there must be (1)an original spreader or source, (2)some content that is being transferred, (3)a context or medium through which the transfer occurs, and (4)a new target victim that can become the spreader in the next cycle of reproduction. Taking out one of these elements will stop further proliferation. For each of these categories and for both germs and fake news is examined what systems humanity currently has in place to undermine them. After comparison, it was found that for the first three categories the defense systems are strongly comparable. However, for the fourth category it was found that humans actively vaccinate each other against specific germs, but that there is no equivalent in place to structurally defend our minds against specific fake news. To remedy this, an educational program is proposed that relies on the ‘inoculation theory’. This means that children are stimulated to opinionate themselves against common fundamental topics in fake news, such as inequality based on race, religion, sex, or personality. The theory states that since the children have defended themselves once against certain ideas, they will have a stronger internal aversion against adopting ideas containing similar but bigger threats, like in this case racism, antisemitism, misogynism, or homophobia. Therefore, opinionizing children will make them less susceptible to fake news."

"Twee naakte, elkaar kussende kinderen: over het ontstaan, de betekenis en de invloed van een ongewoon iconografisch motief in Italië en in de Lage Landen (ca. 1490-1550)","['Mulder, Ilse']","['Kwakkelstein, Michael']",2023-07-06T00:01:09Z,NL,['Leonardo da Vinci; kussende kinderen; Leonardesk motief; Italiaanse zestiende-eeuwse schilderkunst; zuid-Nederlandse zestiende-eeuwse schilderkunst'],Kunstgeschiedenis,"Centraal in dit onderzoek staan voorstellingen in de vroeg zestiende-eeuwse Italiaanse en Zuid-Nederlandse schilderkunst van het thema van twee naakte, op de grond gezeten en elkaar kussende kinderen. Dit thema wordt in de literatuur vaak aangeduid als ‘Christus en Johannes als kinderen, elkaar omarmend’. Hoewel ruimschoots aandacht is besteed aan de manier waarop dit, omstreeks 1490 in Milaan door Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) ontwikkelde thema schilders in de Lage Landen heeft bereikt, is het tot op heden niet duidelijk wat de populariteit van dit merkwaardige motief in de Lage Landen verklaart. Vandaar dat het huidige onderzoek een zo volledig mogelijke inventarisatie bevat van kunstwerken met dit thema ten einde de invloed ervan nader te kunnen duiden. Om een verklaring te vinden voor de populariteit van het leonardeske thema is onderzoek verricht naar de betekenis ervan en naar de functie die kunstwerken met dit thema kunnen hebben gehad. De onderzoeksvraag luidt daarom als volgt: Hoe groot was de invloed van het leonardeske motief van de twee naakte, elkaar kussende kinderen, op de vroege zestiendeeeuwse schilderkunst in Italië en in de Lage Landen en hoe kan de populariteit, betekenis en functie van deze ongewone iconografie worden verklaard? Het onderzoek begint met het vaststellen van de datering van de aan Leonardo toegeschreven tekening waarop het thema zou zijn gebaseerd (afb. 1). Vervolgens zijn de in de literatuur voorgestelde visuele antieke bronnen die Leonardo kunnen hebben geïnspireerd, kritisch beschreven. Op basis van een analyse van andere uitbeeldingen van een vergelijkbaar kind motief in Leonardo’s tekeningen waarbij rekening is gehouden met de datering, is aangetoond dat Leonardo zich niet heeft kunnen laten inspireren door de antieke riviersculpturen de Nijl en de Tiber, zoals vaak is gesuggereerd. Eerder is een verband aan te tonen tussen Leonardo’s motief van de twee naakte, elkaar kussende kinderen en de beeldhouwkunst van Donatello of leden van de Della Robbia familie.Het geringe aantal Italiaanse varianten van het leonardeske thema van de twee naakte, elkaar kussende kinderen, wekt de indruk dat er voor dit thema in Italië weinig belangstelling bestond. Daarentegen zijn er talloze uitbeeldingen bekend van het Christuskind en Johannes de Doper als kind die elkaar omhelzen in de context van de Heilige Familie. Het feit dat er slechts vier Italiaanse werken bekend zijn die de naakte, elkaar kussende kinderen als hoofdonderwerp hebben in afwezigheid van de andere heilige figuren en zonder iconografische kenmerken, bevestigt dat er blijkbaar geen interesse en vraag was naar dit thema en het vermoedelijk dus geen andere, seculiere betekenis en functie van het heeft vervuld in Italië. Vermoedelijk bereikten twee van deze vier werken al snel na voltooiing de Lage Landen en lijkt het derde en vierde werk slechts een voorbereidende schets en voorbereiding voor een groter paneel te zijn. Dat zou een reden kunnen zijn waarom de navolging van het thema in Italië uitbleef. Het thema van de twee naakte, elkaar kussende kinderen kreeg echter wel veel navolging in de Lage Landen. De laatst gepubliceerde inventaris van de schilderijen die verbonden worden aan Joos van Cleve (1485-1541) en zijn atelier, zoals de oeuvrecatalogus van John Oliver Hand uit 2004, bleek niet meer actueel. Tot op heden lijken er namelijk 27 schilderijen te zijn met hetzelfde motief, die daarom stuk voor stuk aan zijn werkplaats gekoppeld kunnen worden. Uit eerder onderzoek van Micha Leeflang werd al duidelijk dat Joos van Cleve en de werknemers uit zijn atelier inspeelden op de markt en het kopiëren vergemakkelijkten door het gebruik van hulpmiddelen. Uit gegevens in primaire bronnen is geconcludeerd dat het thema tot in de late zeventiende eeuw populair was onder kunstverzamelaars in de Lage Landen. (...)"

Maar ook nieuw leven blazen in wat de futuristen zagen als een statische cultuur in verval. In verschillende manifesten riepen de futuristen Italië op de last van het verleden van zich af te werpen. Vaak in een nog steeds schokkende taal waarmee werd opgeroepen tot de vernietiging van bibliotheken, musea en historische steden zoals Venetië. Onder deze uitdagende taal ging echter ook een oprechte overtuiging schuil dat het de plicht was van moderne kunstenaars om niet te dwepen met het verleden maar zich te verbinden met de snel veranderende moderne wereld om hen heen. Volgens de futuristen was de aandacht voor het moderne leven de enige manier om de oude in verval zijnde cultuur en maatschappij van Italië te revitaliseren. De moderne kunst moest aansluiting vinden bij nieuwe sensaties zoals snelheid en dynamiek. Vanuit deze overtuiging ontstond een eigen, nieuwe, futuristische kunst, die trachtte beweging, snelheid en simultaneïteit, de uiteenvallende werkelijkheid, te verbeelden. 

In deze scriptie is onderzoek gedaan naar de introductie van het futurisme in Nederland in 1912 en 1913. Russolo ’s schilderij La rivolta (De opstand) was al in 1911 te zien op een van de eerste exposities van futuristische kunst in Milaan. Daarna was dit schilderij onderdeel van de reizende tentoonstelling van futuristische kunst die in februari 1912 voor het eerst te zien was bij galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Parijs. Vervolgens reisde deze tentoonstelling langs verschillende Europese steden waaronder Londen, Berlijn en Brussel, maar ook naar Den Haag, Amsterdam en Rotterdam. De tentoonstellingen in Nederland zijn vrij informeel tot stand gekomen. Daarnaast is gekeken naar de invloed van deze tentoonstellingen van futuristische kunst op de beeldende kunst in Nederland. Hiertoe is een onderscheid gemaakt tussen een visuele invloed en een meer theoretische invloed. In beide gevallen is sprake van een beïnvloeding die gekenmerkt werd door de manier waarop het futurisme in Nederland geïntroduceerd werd, namelijk via de Duitse kunst en de ideeën van Kandinsky. Veel minder aandacht was er voor specifiek futuristische kenmerken als ‘een nieuwe kunst voor een nieuwe tijd’ en de vormgeving van deze nieuwe tijd."
Left-Wing Extremism and Cyber Activism: An Investigation into the Securitisation of linksunten.indymedia.org as a Space for Cyber Activism by Germany’s Authorities,"['Bekiş, Jerôme']","['Graaf, Beatrice de']",2023-07-06T00:00:47Z,EN,['linksunten.indymedia.org; securitisation theory; left-wing extremism; Germany; cyber-activism; censorship'],History,"On 25 August 2017, the then German Minister of the Interior, Thomas de Maizière, announced at a press conference that the platform linksunten.indymedia.org had been declared illegal. The decision to ban a platform that described itself as a space for activism and citizen journalism, and which had been operating for almost a decade at that point, came as a shock to many and was met with both protests and legal challenges. This move by the German authorities was particularly notable at the time as it came rather abruptly, especially as the government had been monitoring the platform virtually since its inception in 2008. This thesis presents the findings of a study that sought to understand the process that led to this outcome. It did so by examining this process from a historical perspective and using securitisation theory as a theoretical framework. Furthermore, this thesis made use of a variety of different types of publicly digitally available sources and adopted a methodological approach based on explaining-outcome process tracing. The argument presented in this thesis is that the process that led to the banning of linksunten.indymedia.org can be seen not only as a process of securitisation that began in 2016, but also as a process that, in addition to being driven by political considerations and strategic timing, was significantly shaped by the broader context in which it unfolded that served the purpose of the facilitating conditions. This context was one in which online content deemed harmful and illegal, such as extremist content, was increasingly seen as problematic by both the public and policymakers, and there was a greater receptiveness to government intervention to address this phenomenon, which was a development that had only recently occurred following a series of events in Germany and beyond that brought the issue into the spotlight. In the midst of all this, the German government was able to successfully securitise the platform by framing it as a security threat, culminating in its criminalisation and shutdown. These findings, in turn, raise broader questions about the proportionality of the decision to ban the platform altogether and the potential instrumentalisation of the state’s powers to combat extremism for political ends."

using the method of discursive interface analysis as by Mell Stanfill, this research on the interfaces of
the NPO platforms NPO.nl and NPO Start shows what kind of discourse NPO produces on public
value through functional, cognitive and sensory affordances contributing to personalisation,

platform interfaces construct meaning about public value in relation to public goals and the use of
personalisation and recommendation strategies? Whilst applying a critical perspective on
neoliberalism in the discursive interface analysis, I argue that the interface affordances contributing
to personalisation, recommendation and public goals solidify the prevailing neoliberal discourse
regarding the notion of public value as value for neoliberal citizenship as encompassing
individualisation, identity, difference, and choice. This perspective challenges the perceived
dichotomy between public/not-for-profit and private/market value as consumption is being
positioned as part of citizenship. In this process, NPO centralises the public goals of ‘transparency’
and ‘accountability’ as a means of legitimising their personalisation and recommendation strategies."

Daarbij wordt onderzocht of de ne-deleties vaker voorkomen in dialogen binnen formele of binnen informele contexten en of deze vervolgens zijn doorgevoerd in de Franse intralinguale ondertitels van Netflix. De hoofdvraag die in dit onderzoek gesteld wordt, is: “Hoe verschilt ne-deletie in intralinguale ondertitels binnen formele en informele contexten?” Om hier een antwoord op te kunnen geven is een corpus opgesteld dat bestaat uit de intralinguale ondertitels van in totaal acht afleveringen van de bovengenoemde series.

Tot slot is bepaald of ze in dialogen binnen een formele of informele context hebben plaatsgevonden. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat ne-deletie vaker voorkomt in dialogen binnen een informele context en ne-behoud vaker in dialogen binnen een formele context. Daarnaast werden de ne-deleties ook veelvoudig doorgevoerd in de intralinguale ondertitels. Naar aanleiding van deze resultaten kan worden aangenomen dat ne-deletie niet alleen een fenomeen is uit de spreektaal, maar dat het preverbaal ook in geschreven tekst, te weten intralinguale ondertitels, wordt weggelaten.

Hierdoor neemt de traditionele bestuursvorm van top-downbestuur ('government') af, terwijl er steeds meer wordt overgestapt naar nieuwe vormen van horizontaal bestuur ('governance') (Rhodes, 1996). Door middel van meta-governance wordt inzicht verkregen hoe een overheid sturing kan geven aan zelfsturende actoren die samenwerken in een governancenetwerk (Sørensen, 2006). Binnen een governancenetwerk is er sprake van samenwerking tussen organisaties voor het behalen van een gemeenschappelijk doel (Sørensen & Torfing, 2009). 
	In deze studie is dit B&O-vraagstuk vertaald naar de sportsector en staat de vraag centraal op hoe de Koninklijke Nederlandse Schaatsbond (KNSB) als nationale sportbond kan sturen op de interorganisatorische samenwerking binnen de wedstrijdsport voor de jonge langebaanschaatser. De onzekerheid over de toekomst van de wedstrijdsport voor de jonge langebaanschaatser neemt toe: Het aantal jonge langebaanschaatsers is in de afgelopen 4 jaar voor de coronapandemie met 14% gedaald (persoonlijke communicatie, KNSB, 2022). Deze daling heeft geleid tot interne signalen van verenigingsbestuurders bij de KNSB en vraagt om nader onderzoek (persoonlijke communicatie, KNSB, 2022). De uitdagingen waarmee bestuurders te maken hebben in de wedstrijdsport voor de jonge langebaanschaatser kunnen niet worden genegeerd, omdat de uitdagingen mogelijk impact hebben op de toekomst van de wedstrijdsport van het langebaanschaatsen. Het doel van het onderzoek is het verkrijgen van inzicht in hoe de KNSB kan sturen op de huidige interorganisatorische samenwerking binnen de wedstrijdsport voor de jonge langebaanschaatser. Op basis van deze doelstelling is de volgende onderzoeksvraag geformuleerd: Hoe kan de KNSB sturen op de interorganisatorische samenwerking binnen de wedstrijdsport voor de jonge langebaanschaatser?
Dit onderzoek maakt gebruik van een exploratieve onderzoeksmethode waarbij de focus ligt op het verkrijgen van nieuwe inzichten en het begrijpen van de waarheid volgens de respondenten. Hierbij zijn tien semigestructureerde interviews afgenomen voor het verkrijgen van inzicht in de huidige interorganisatorische samenwerking binnen de wedstrijdsport. Daarnaast is er een focusgroep gehouden met zes bestuurders binnen de wedstrijdsport, waarbij de mogelijke positie van de KNSB in het wedstrijdaanbod voor de jonge langebaanschaatser werd besproken.
	De resultaten van het onderzoek geven inzicht in hoe de huidige interorganisatorische samenwerking van de wedstrijdsport voor de jonge langebaanschaatser steeds verder onder druk komt te staan. Deze ‘bestuurlijke druk’ wordt ook omgeschreven als toenemende uitdagingen die de actoren binnen de wedstrijdsport ervaren, zoals financiële onzekerheid, de onstabiele situatie van het gewest, vrijwilligersmanagement en ontwikkelingen in de vraag naar wedstrijdaanbod. In de onderzoeksresultaten van dit onderzoek wordt benoemd dat de huidige wedstrijdsport voor de jonge langebaanschaatser ter sprake staat door het teruglopende aantal wedstrijdsporters.
De actoren binnen de wedstrijdsport hebben daarbij behoefte aan ondersteuning vanuit de KNSB in het verminderen van de bestuurlijke druk. Daarbij zijn door de respondenten enkele kansen en bedreigingen benoemd waar de KNSB op kan sturen binnen de huidige interorganisatorische samenwerking.

Het spel is ontworpen ter verkenning van het opzetten van het theoretische bovenbouwvak kunst (algemeen) op Academie Tien. Daarom is het spel gebaseerd op de volgende onderwijsprincipes van Academie Tien: onderwijs volgens grote vragen en -opdrachten, verwondering en ‘hele taak eerst’. Ook heeft het spel als doel om de leerlingen te laten leren over de beeldende kunst uit de zeventiende eeuw in Nederland. Daarom zijn de eindtermen van het centraal examen van kunst (algemeen) zoals deze zijn beschreven in de syllabus als uitgangspunt genomen. Leerlingen leren verschillende vaardigheden aan die beschreven zijn in domein A (eindterm 1) en leren over specifieke aspecten uit de verschillende invalshoeken voor reflectie uit domein B (eindterm 2-7) en C (eindterm 8).

Judith Leyster heeft een vrij ‘mannelijke’ carrière gehad als kunstenaar en haar leven en werk kan dus goed gebruikt worden om aan de bovengenoemde eindtermen te voldoen. De syllabus van het vak kunst (algemeen) is namelijk niet neutraal, maar draagt dezelfde vooronderstellingen als de kunstgeschiedschrijving. Het is geschreven vanuit een wit westers mannelijk perspectief. Ook in de gangbare lesmethoden zoals Bespiegeling of Art History schemert dit door. In het spel wordt dan ook het leven en werk van Judith Leyster en de historiografie hierover als uitgangspunt genomen om een inclusiever alternatief te presenteren op het gebied van de representatie van vrouwen. Daarbij wordt haar uitzonderingspositie ten opzichte van haar vrouwelijke tijdgenoten en haar geslacht benadrukt.

De verhaallijn van het spel is gebaseerd op de ‘herontdekking’ van Judith Leyster door C.H. de Groot in 1893. In het spel moeten leerlingen aan de hand van verschillende puzzels erachter komen van wie de mysterieuze brief is die ze hebben ontvangen. In de brief staat dat de schrijfster in de vergetelheid is geraakt omdat ze anders is. Gaandeweg komen de leerlingen erachter dat de brief van Judith Leyster is. Door deze casus als uitgangspunt te nemen voor het spel, biedt het een ingang om de onderliggende vooronderstellingen van de kunstgeschiedschrijving bloot te leggen. De herontdekking van Judith Leyster en de historiografie over haar leven en werk illustreert dit gegeven. De manier waarop Leyster in de literatuur is gepresenteerd door de jaren heen is exemplarisch voor de manier waarop vrouwelijke kunstenaars in het algemeen uit die periode werden neergezet: als inferieur, kopiist, huisvrouw, seksueel wezen, vrouw-van etc."
The Improvement in Ideal Cardiovascular Health over Time in the General Population,"['Wang, Ziyi']","['Bots, Michiel']",2023-07-14T00:00:45Z,EN,"['cardiovascular health, trend, general population']",Epidemiology,"Abstract
Background
CVDs are responsible for the highest number of fatalities worldwide, claiming approximately 17.9 million lives annually. Keeping a good cardiovascular health status is very important. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the prevalence of ideal CVH and how it has evolved over time.
Aim
This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) in the general population and to examine any variations in these trends based on age and gender. Moreover, the study aims to identify the main drivers of change in ideal CVH.
Method
The study utilized data from the Utrecht Health Project, specifically focusing on individuals aged 18 years and above from a new residential area in the Netherlands. We use cross-sectional study design, and participants were assessed for various cardiovascular health metrics, except diet. Generalized linear models were performed to analyse the variations in cardiovascular health status over time and to investigate the relationships with age, sex, and other relevant factors.
Results
The distribution of cardiovascular health (CVH) categories was as follows: 19.3% were classified as having poor CVH, 71.5% fell into the intermediate CVH group, and only a small proportion of 9.2% exhibited ideal CVH. The mean cardiovascular health score increased slightly over time[61.0(0.257);62.4(0.262);62.9(0.416)], indicating an improvement in cardiovascular health status. Furthermore, the age effect is growing bigger with time flows[0(ref);0.008(-0.052,0.060);0.009(-0.067,0.080)], while female sex effect is growing smaller with time goes by[0(ref);-0.52(-1.81,0.92);-0.02(-1.84,1.75)]. Furthermore, the main driver of change in ideal CVH is education level [10.65(9.76,11.54)].
Conclusion
Most people are in the intermediate group, females tend to have better CVH status than males. The cardiovascular health status in increasing over time. Age and sex have different effect with time trend, age is calm while sex is significant. People with higher education tend to have better cardiovascular health status."
The occupational gradient in public sector corruption: Explaining bribery and favouritism in the European Union,"['Azevedo Branco, Rosa de']","['Barbosa Machado, W.']",2023-07-13T00:02:00Z,EN,['occupational status; corruption; Europe; public sector; bribery; favouritism; rational choice; collective action'],Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems,"The purpose of this study is to investigate if occupational status is a determinant of individual level petty corruption, focusing specifically on the engagement in bribery and favouritism in the public sector. Another contribution is made by comparing national levels of corruption and their influence on this relationship. This research theorises that individual corrupt behaviour is rooted in rational choices people make by weighing the potential costs and benefits of corrupt actions. It is expected that the economic and social capital that come with occupational status influences this balance and leads to a greater likelihood of engaging in bribery and favouritism. It then adds context to this model by arguing that an individuals’ decision to engage in corruption is also driven by national corruption, which is expected to weaken the positive relation. A fixed effects binary logistic regression is utilised to test these mechanisms, using cross-sectional survey data from the Global Corruption Barometer and the Corruption Perceptions Index. Over 16,000 individuals from all 27 European Member States are included in the analysis. Findings show that people with a higher occupational status are indeed more likely to engage in bribery, but this effect is absent for favouritism. National corruption does not weaken the effects. This study suggests that occupational status increases the likelihood to bribe, though it remains unclear whether the reason is a greater willingness, ability, or exposure to bribery. The role of social capital on favouritism remains blurred and requires more research. Monitoring and speak up procedures may increase the costs of bribery. E-governments may prevent in-person bribery and favouritism."
The influence of well-being programs emphasizing individual responsibility on self-stigmatization and the moderating role of health controllability.,"['Noltee, Rens']","['Versteegt, Lisanne']",2023-07-14T00:00:42Z,EN,"['Well-being programs, burnout; mental health; students; healthism; attribution \ntheory; Netherlands']","Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","There is a high prevalence of burnout-related complaints such as emotional exhaustion among university students. Because of these high numbers there is a growing trend in universities who implement well-being programs. There is some evidence that these well-being programs have small positive effects, but they could also cause self-stigmatization. That is why the aim of this study was to examine if the focus of a well-being program (individual vs. organizational responsibility) influences self-stigmatization and if this is moderated by health controllability. The hypotheses were that self-stigmatization is higher when a well-being program emphasizes individual responsibility than when a well-being program emphasizes organizational responsibility and that the relationship between well-being programs and selfstigmatization will be moderated by health controllability. The results showed that selfstigmatization is indeed higher when a well-being program emphasizes individual responsibility than when a well-being program emphasizes organizational responsibility. 
Further, the results showed that health controllability didn’t moderate the effect of well-being programs on self-stigmatization. In the discussion the strengths and limitations of this study are discussed, and some recommendations are also made for policy and further research."

These materials were implemented in a three-week intervention, after which pupils were asked about their experience. In addition, the intervention materials were presented to experts: EFL teachers and a professional working for an educational publishing company. Though the experts were mostly positive, the pupils found the classes mostly redundant and non-engaging. Potentially, this negative feedback may be due to surface level features, such as length of direct instruction, rather than the metalinguistic nature of the intervention. These findings resulted in a list of good practices and suggestions based on the professional opinions of the interviewees, observations during the intervention lessons, and the experiences and feedback of the participating pupils."

Hier zijn twee belangrijke bevindingen uit duidelijk geworden, ten eerste laat de analyse zien dat nativistisch discours niet alleen tekenend is voor de huidige tijd, maar dat hier ook al sprake van was in de twintigste eeuw. Het nativistisch discours bestond voor de millenniumwisseling vooral uit economische drijfveer, het idee hierachter is de druk die op de Nederlandse welvaart door de grote aantallen immigranten. De verandering die het discours heeft ondergaan is te wijten aan de aanslagen in New York in 2001. Sindsdien is het cultureel nativistische discours tegenover immigranten uit niet-westerse landen, met name islamitische immigranten, onderdeel geworden van het discours en heeft dit de boventoon. De basis van dit nativistische argument is dat de immigranten botsen met de joods-christelijke cultuur. Ten tweede is het anti-EU-sentiment ook in opkomst na de millenniumwisseling, hierbij wordt er verwezen naar het uitdijende machtsapparaat dat de kloof tussen de burgers en de politiek vergroot. Vanaf 2009 krijgt dit meer voeten aan de grond. Zowel het nativisme tegenover (moslim)immigranten en de EU zijn een bedreiging voor de Nederlandse volk en identiteit, de welvaart en de joods-christelijke samenleving."

"Bewustwording als de ultieme remedie? Een kwalitatief onderzoek naar de kloof tussen beleidsmaatregelen en oplossingen van ervaringsdeskundigen, gericht op de bestrijding van etnische discriminatie.","['Slokker, Tim']","['Sylvester, Joyce']",2023-07-21T00:00:57Z,NL,['Etnische discriminatie; discriminatie; Perceived Etnic Discrimination Questionnaire'],Bestuur en beleid,"Op 19 december 2022 maakte de Nederlandse staat, bij monde van haar minister-president, excuses voor haar eigen aandeel in het Nederlandse slavernijverleden. Om deze excuses kracht bij te zetten, werd tegelijkertijd een bewustwordingsfonds gecreëerd. Dit fonds zal zich onder meer richten op de bestrijding van etnische discriminatie, waar het slavernijverleden als één van de veroorzakers van wordt gezien. De minister van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties benadrukte dat het van belang is dat voor de besteding van dit fonds, het gesprek wordt aangegaan met mensen die de doorwerking van dit verleden ervaren. Hiermee lijkt zij een antwoord te bieden op de veelgehoorde kritiek dat ‘antidiscriminatiebeleid wordt gemaakt voor mensen, maar niet met mensen die discriminatie ervaren’, een discrepantie die zeker in het geval van etnische discriminatie vaak wordt verondersteld.

Echter voor deze veronderstelde discrepantie tussen het beleid gericht op de bestrijding van etnische discriminatie en de maatregelen die noodzakelijk worden bevonden door mensen die etnische discriminatie (hebben) ervaren, bestaat geen wetenschappelijk onderbouwing. Daarom staat binnen deze scriptie de volgende vraag centraal: In welke mate bestaat er een discrepantie tussen de in het beleid genoemde acties gericht op de bestrijding van etnische discriminatie en de opvattingen over de benodigde acties volgens hen die etnische discriminatie ervaren?

Ter beantwoording van deze vraag is er in het kader van dit onderzoek gebruik gemaakt van een drietal methoden. In de eerste plaats is er een kwalitatieve documentenanalyse uitgevoerd, om de maatregelen gericht op de bestrijding van etnische discriminatie in het huidige beleid te achterhalen. Vervolgens zijn er voor dit onderzoek expertinterviews afgenomen met onder meer medewerkers van antidiscriminatievoorzieningen en regionale ombudsfunctionarissen. Ten slotte zijn er aan de hand van de Perceived Etnic Discrimination Questionnaire – Community Version interviews afgenomen met burgers die zelf etnische discriminatie (hebben) ervaren.

Concluderend kan er op basis van de gevonden resultaten worden gesteld dat er in sterke mate sprake is van een discrepantie tussen de maatregelen ter bestrijding van etnische discriminatie, zoals deze worden genoemd in het beleid en die worden aangedragen door mensen die etnische discriminatie ervaren. Uit de documentenanalyse komt namelijk naar voren dat het hedendaagse beleid zich in sterke mate richt op bewustwording omtrent stereotypen en vooroordelen, middels campagnes, handreikingsdocumenten en voorlichtingssessies. Echter, uit de interviews komt een andere behoefte naar voren. De respondenten geven aan dat bewustwording weliswaar belangrijk is, maar dat dit niet een effectief en volmaakt middel vormt. Volgens de respondenten is bewustwording alleen effectief, indien dit plaatsvindt op alle levensdomeinen van een individu. De respondenten geven daarentegen aan dat er juist behoefte is aan een duidelijk geformuleerde norm binnen het beleid, omdat deze in het hedendaagse beleid nog te vaak te onduidelijk is. 

Daarnaast stellen de respondenten dat het van belang is dat mensen in contact komen met personen van diverse etnische achtergronden, hetgeen volgens de respondenten middels beleid door de overheid dient te worden gestimuleerd. Ook kaarten zij het belang aan van positieve representatie van etnische minderheden en het belang van het centraliseren van beleid gericht op de bestrijding van etnische discriminatie."
3D instantaneous dynamics modelling of the surface motion associated with East European subduction zones,"['Amerongen, Bert van']","['Spakman, Wim']",2023-07-22T00:00:47Z,EN,"['Geodynamics, Numerical Modelling, Hellenic Subduction Zone, Aegean, Vrancea, ASPECT, Geodynamic World Builder']",Earth Structure and Dynamics,"Forecasting earthquakes is a prime future target of Solid Earth research to which
geodynamics research can contribute by providing a deep understanding of the physical
drivers generating the lithosphere stress driving earthquakes. Processes confined to the
lithosphere are known to cause stress build-up. However, the contribution of the Earth’s
mantle is less substantiated. Assessing the contribution of deep dynamic drivers to
lithosphere deformation can be done by numerical modelling by creating predictions of
deformation that are then tested against observations, e.g., the GNSS surface motion field.
Here we present the findings of 3D geodynamic modelling of the Vrancea (east
Carpathians) and Aegean subduction zones in south-eastern Europe. Two differing
tectonic settings - in Vrancea seismically active continent-continent collision and in the
Aegean roll-back subduction- of differing scale are present, providing a suitable case to
test interplay of mantle drivers and their effect on surface/crustal flow. To this end a 3D
initial temperature-density model is designed from published lithospheric thickness and
tomography models down to a depth of 800 km. We solve the equations describing the
conservation of mass and momentum pertinent to a viscoplastic continuum, using the
finite-element code ASPECT (Kronbichler, Heister and Bangerth 2012). Surface motion
predictions from these models are then validated against the observed GNSS field (Global
Navigation Satellite System, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS)). First a
reference model is constructed that shows a good first-order fit of the crustal flow field,
namely the characteristic westward movement of Anatolia and a rotation to the SW of the
Aegean region towards the Hellenic trench. Predictions of the flow in the upper mantle
show that the surface flow is correlated to the predicted mantle flow pattern and models
without the Aegean slab fail to explain the rotation of the Aegean region. Experiments on
the seismically active Vrancea slab cannot show differences in predicted surface
observables between a slab that is continuous or a detached slab, but the models predict
that a continuous slab experiences more resistance from the mantle against slab dragging
by the Eurasian plate which could increase seismic activity. Second, experiments are
performed to determine the sensitivity of the surface flow field for the make-up and
rheology of the lithosphere and slabs. Potential model improvements such as STEP faults
and a rheologically heterogeneous Eurasian plate are explored. Furthermore, the 3D
models provide novel insight into the correlation between mantle flow and the pattern of
seismic mantle anisotropy in subduction zones, as well as the 3D interaction between
mantle flow, basal tractions on the lithosphere and tectonic plate motions. This research
provides a steppingstone to more detailed studies of subduction plate boundary regions,
which may lead to a better understanding of the physical drivers of crustal deformation
and flow and may provide constraints for future seismic-hazard modelling."
Environmental decision-making within the EU: the dynamics between neoclassical economics and limits to growth,"['Roefs, Lotte']","['Marin, Irina']",2023-07-22T00:00:38Z,EN,['limits-to-growth; neoclassical economics; European Union; green growth.'],Geschiedenis van Politiek en Maatschappij,"Since knowledge about humans’ impact on the environment became available in the late 19th century, it took some time for this to become of political concern. Only at the end of the 1960s did this topic emerge on political agendas in various parts of the world. In the governmental bodies of the just-founded European Union (EU), environmental concerns started to become part of policy around this time as well. At this moment, decision-making by the EU institutions had developed to become almost solely underpinned by neoclassical economic theory. Consequently, the environmental strategy of the EU has grown to adopt a green growth approach, as opposed to the advice of environmental scientists who argue for an approach considering the limitations of the Earth.

In my thesis, I aim to get an indication of whether a change from a growth-pursuing ideology to a limits-to-growth ideology is possible by applying the theory of path dependence on the historical development of the EU’s environmental strategy. I hypothesise that, if any openings for change have occurred in the past, these openings occurred due to exogenous shocks such as economic and social pressures.

I conclude that it will be rather difficult for the EU to change their environmental strategy to a less growth-driven one. First, a limits-to-growth alternative appeared to be not present during the critical juncture at which the EU was founded. Second, none of the limits-to-growth principles has been present during the development of the EU’s environmental strategy. Third, the self-reinforcing mechanisms underlying the neoclassical economic ideology in the EU’s environmental strategy appear to be very strong. Not only are they suggesting that the institutional pattern of the EU needs to serve the overall economic system on which the EU was initially founded; they also indicate that the growth-enhancing beliefs of the EU are fuelled by the sustainable growth ideology from influential parties such as the United Nations and the Brundtland Commission."
A Framework for Evaluating Knowledge Sharing Behavior Enabled by Good Practice Repositories: An Application to openBest,"['Pijl, Stefan van der']","['España Cubillo, S.']",2023-07-21T23:00:50Z,EN,['Good practices; Good practice repositories; Improvement planning; knowledge sharing; Measuring knowledge sharing behavior; openBest; Sustainability'],Business Informatics,"[BACKGROUND] The traditional way of running a company is outdated. Businesses realize that they must 
take steps to become more responsible. This involves identifying topics of interest, assessing performance 
on these topics, planning improvement where necessary, and implementing these improvements. This 
project focuses on planning improvement steps. Here, organizations determine and plan the actions 
required to improve performance on ethical, social, and environmental (ESE) topics. The challenge in this 
phase is to close the gap between high-level goals and concrete actions. The treatment of 
(interorganizational) knowledge sharing using good practices in good practice repositories is suggested to 
address this challenge. By sharing good practices, organizations can reuse the knowledge and experience 
of other organizations to determine steps to become more sustainable. Research reported in the scientific 
literature has often focused on describing good practice repositories and other knowledge-sharing tools, 
claiming their expected impact on the knowledge-sharing behavior of the stakeholders. However, 
evaluating such behavior and validating the knowledge-sharing impact of good practice repositories 
remains challenging. [OBJECTIVE] This research aims to provide a framework to assess the knowledgesharing behavior enabled by good practice repositories. [METHODOLOGY] We design a knowledgesharing behavior measurement framework to evaluate knowledge-sharing enabled by a good practice 
repository (GPR). The framework is implemented in an existing model-driven good practice repository 
proof of concept called openBest. The implemented measurement framework is applied in a laboratory 
setting using students as surrogate end users. During this empirical test, we collect knowledge-sharing 
behavior data by monitoring the activity in openBest and collect measured KS activity using the 
implemented knowledge-sharing behavior measurement framework. These are compared to assess the 
quality of the measurement framework. We then analyze the measured KS data and investigate how it 
allows the assessment of knowledge-sharing behavior. Moreover, we investigated the extent to which 
knowledge-sharing behavior occurs in openBest during the empirical test using measured and monitored 
activity data. [RESULTS] The measured knowledge sharing behavior reflects the monitored knowledgesharing behavior that we could observe. Furthermore, the measured data are of high quality since no 
(unexplainable) inconsistencies were observed between the monitored and measured activity data. 
Additionally, the measured data did not show (unexplainable) flaws in completeness and order. 
Furthermore, the measured data are suitable for frequency and time analyses involving activities related 
to KS. It is not suitable for qualitative analysis and, for this, manually monitored data can be used. KS 
activity measured during the test is mostly limited to the execution of tasks, as only limited additional
activities related to KS were observed. [CONCLUSION] The measurement framework we propose allows 
for assessing quantitative knowledge-sharing behavior enabled by a GPR because the framework captures 
accurate KS behavior data in a suitable format for quantitative analysis. For qualitative data analysis, the 
framework is not suitable and, for this, self-reporting or monitored data can be used. The implemented 
measurement instruments seem suitable for the intended analysis but could be expanded in the future by 
including more fine-grained activities. The KS activity recorded during the empirical test was mostly 
limited to the performance of the tasks, but overall there was a some more observed action than expected."

The prevalence of political parties advocating their own versions of truth further exacerbates this challenge. This research explores the effect of anti- science sentiment from political parties on individuals' acceptance of scientific claims and trust in science. Additionally, it investigates whether this effect is more pronounced when associated with populist parties. A survey vignette experiment, utilizing a within- and between-subject design, was conducted in the Netherlands to examine the influence of anti-science sentiment of political parties on individuals.

The results indicate that the anti-science sentiment of political parties does indeed impact citizens' trust in science and their willingness to accept scientific claims. Notably, tweets from the VVD were found to influence people's likelihood to reject scientific claims, while other political parties did not exert a similar influence. Interestingly, both positive and negative sentiments from political parties had a significantly negative effect on people's trust in science, with the negative sentiment having a slightly stronger impact. Moreover, party cueing was not found to have a significant effect on the influence of anti-science sentiment on individuals. Also, people who identified themselves with populist parties also were not significantly affected.

This research sheds light on the critical role that political parties play in shaping public attitudes towards science and emphasizes the importance of discerning reliable information in an era of increasing misinformation. Further investigation into the dynamics of political party influence on science perception can aid in developing strategies to bolster trust in scientific evidence and promote informed decision-making in society."

Without radical solutions across all sectors of society aimed at addressing these climate problems, the world risks tipping over the 1.5°C warming limit as set out in the Paris agreement. To meet these challenges some academics are calling for a transition to a new socio-economic paradigm, degrowth, which prioritises equity in living standards and maintaining the planetary boundaries above economic growth. One of the sectors which degrowth is looking to influence is the mobility sector, which has historically had a close relationship to growth and environmental emissions. But enabling radical social change is a difficult task, however, educational institutions have been citied as a special case when it comes to societal change and could help degrowth challenge the growth hegemony. To help foster this change. this study looks to explore what the main themes of degrowth urban mobility and how university interact with degrowth. This will be done by taking a deductive and inductive approach to this question, using a mixture of literature study and interviews with scholars to do so. The result of this study is that degrowth urban mobility can be categorised by 4 themes, 1. as a counter to the hegemony of growth mobility, 2. As a balance of tensions within degrowth urban mobility, 3. As a warning against techno-optimism, but not to appropriate technology use, and 4. As a chance to remake the urban. The study also used insights gained from academic scholars to construct a framework to investigate how universities interact with the societal need for degrowth, through investigating its links to degrowth urban mobility. The results of this is that universities are failing to act in a socially responsible manner toward degrowth urban mobility through its social and organisational impacts. However, in its educational and cognitive impacts, the picture is mixed, with studies on geography aligning with degrowth urban mobility principles, but engineering failing in this. This suggests that universities have a lot to do before becoming socially responsible for degrowth futures, and more research should be undertaken to examine these links between universities and degrowth."
"COMPARISON OF DATA IMPUTATION METHODS PERFORMANCE FOR MULTIPLE SYSTEM ESTIMATION 
(CASE STUDY: HUMAN TRAFFICKING DATA IN THE NETHERLANDS 2016 - 2019)","['Nikolas Anova, Nikolas']","['Cruyff, Maarten']",2023-07-25T00:02:16Z,EN,"['Multiple System Estimation; Human Trafficking, Missing Data; Multiple Imputation; \nperformance comparison']",Applied Data Science,"Human trafficking is a problem that still occurs in the modern world, and it is necessary to monitor 
the number of victims. Since human trafficking is a hidden crime, statistics on identified trafficking 
victims only reveal a small part of the problem, and the actual number of victims can only be 
estimated. UNODC recommends using Multiple Systems Estimation (MSE), whereby the size of a 
hidden population of human trafficking victims is estimated by analyzing the overlap between 
three or more administrative lists on which persons belonging to that population appear. 
In MSE implementation, one of the main problems is missing data. This problem is most likely to 
occur in the application of MSE due to the use of registration data from several different external 
sources. The application of the imputation method should be able to solve missing data problems.
Since this problem frequently occurs in MSE implementations, however, based on literature 
reviews, a comparative study of the imputation method performance based on the MSE output 
has never been conducted. Case in the Netherlands, the missing data problem in human 
trafficking records also happened in 2016 – 2019. Nevertheless, in previous studies with the same 
data, multiple imputation was used only with the default method for binary and 2-level 
categorical data (i.e., logistic regression). The existence of missing data certainly has reduced the 
quality of population estimates. However, to produce the best MSE output, choosing the suitable 
imputation method must be done beforehand.
Based on these problems, this study compared the imputation methods performance based on 
the MSE results in estimating the human trafficking population in the Netherlands from 2016 –
2019. The comparison is seen through the AIC and BIC value of the model. Then the comparison 
continues between the AIC and BIC version, which is compared based on model complexity, 
standard error, and reasonableness of estimation. This study focuses on using multiple imputation 
with seven different methods. These methods are predictive mean matching (PMM), 
classification and regression trees (CART), random forest, logistic regression, logistic regression 
with bootstrap, lasso logistic regression, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA).
As a result, different imputation methods produced quite varied MSE model scores and 
population estimation. The CART method produced the best MSE model compared to other 
imputation methods. The imputed dataset by CART has the best AIC and BIC scores compared to 
other imputation methods. The logistic regression method used in previous research produced 
the rank 6th MSE model in both the AIC and BIC versions. On the other hand, random forest is 
the imputation method that had the worst MSE model compared to the others. These results
show that if there is a problem of missing data in the application of MSE, the choice of the 
imputation method is proven to affect the quality of the output from MSE."
Comparing seasonally-varied CNNs in vegetation segmentation performance,"['Urson, Michael']","['Ruessink, Gerben']",2023-07-25T00:02:02Z,EN,['convolutional neural networks; habitat mapping; human-in-the-loop machine learning;image segmentation;uav;drone'],Applied Data Science,"In the Netherlands, management of coastal dunes has changed focus from short-term flood prevention and drinking water protection to long-term biodiversity promotion and back-dune development. To understand the impact of dune management activities, efficient monitoring methods are required. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide images of areas of interest, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to segment these images, are promising developments in remote sensing. Additionally, human-in-the-loop machine learning (HITLML) provides an efficient way to annotate remotely sensed images for land cover classification. Vegetation phenology has shown to impact identifiability from aerial images in some applications. However, the viability of the combined application of these four elements (UAVs, CNNs, HITLML and phenology) to coastal dune monitoring is yet to be assessed. Here we show that these elements can potentially be effective in monitoring coastal dune development. We found that phenology impacts CNN performance, and CNNs trained on multi- season data perform more consistently than single-season CNNs. Additionally, increasing training data volume does not always improve CNN performance. Overall multi-season models’ performance (measured by f1 score) was around 5% better than season-specific CNNs, which is in line with findings of other research. Predictions on specific seasons revealed roughly equivalent performance by season- specific and multi-season CNNs. The impact of increasing the dataset size had minimal effect on model performance. White dunes were most error-prone of all habitat types, being most frequently incorrectly predicted as grey dunes. Our results demonstrate that in the context of dune habitat analysis, training data should comprise seasonal diversity, and that beyond a certain point, increasing the sample size (without additional temporal diversity) is likely to have a limited effect. We anticipate our research to lead to improved practices in automated dune monitoring. Diversity of data appears to have a greater impact on model performance than volume alone, and CNNs provide a useful way to create habitat maps for automated dune monitoring. Additional research should incorporate other factors, such as the impact of weather conditions on results, as well as using ensemble models."
"Using satellite products to improve random forest-based
error correction of hydrological streamflow model","[""Collot d'Escury, Niek""]","['Karssenberg, Derek']",2023-07-25T00:01:57Z,EN,[],Applied Data Science,"Hydrological models are important tools for making streamflow predic- tions and studying the effects of climate change on water resources around the world. This study aims to improve a global hybrid hydrological stream- flow framework based on PCR-GLOBWB and Random Forest (RF), with the addition of satellite products. The selected satellite products are liq-
uid water equivalent from GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Ex- periment), snow cover fraction from JASMES (JAXA Satellite Monitoring for Environmental Studies) and soil moisture from ESA CCI SM (Euro- pean Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Soil Moisture). These prod- ucts are selected because of their relevance for streamflow predictions.
Five global and seven Local (Australia, Canada and the United States) model configurations were used for the RF model. The differences be- tween configurations are based on the inclusion of state variables from PCR-GLOBWB, catchment attributes, satellite products, lagged variables for meteorological input and satellite products of 4 and 12 months and exclusion of state variables from PCR-GLOBWB related to satellite prod- ucts. The results showed that the global and local configurations did not improve compared to the benchmark model (based on 51 predictors from PCR-GLOBWB) and the addition of lag was not significantly effective ei- ther. The configuration with only satellite and meteorological input and satellite products did, however show good performance with only six pre- dictors. After adding static variables to the previous configuration there was equal performance to configurations with state variables from PCR- GLOBWB. These result mean that good performance can be achieved with- out the need for a hydrological model and with a limited number of vari- ables."

The study found that RoBERTa outperformed Bi-LSTM in predicting personality traits on both datasets. However, both models demonstrated varying performances across the two datasets, highlighting the influence of data diversity on model performance. The study also examined the correlations among predicted personality traits and found that the models could capture the sign of the correlations present in the original datasets. However, divergences in the direction of correlations were observed in instances of weak correlations. Besides, the correlations of original datasets and predictions may not align with the findings in psychological studies, which address the importance of annotations when researching the correlations of predicted personality traits."

Parallelization of the cost-distance algorithm,"['Velde, Ewout van der']","['Karssenberg, Derek']",2023-07-25T00:02:12Z,EN,['Cost; Distance; Parallelization; Framework; Multiprocessing;'],Applied Data Science,"Cost distance tool are embedded in various geographic information systems (GIS) giving insights into
spatial relationships. Most GIS software use a serial cost distance algorithm. Cost distance calculations
have a strong sequential nature due to the order we access cells in the raster. This limits the development
of a parallel algorithm, hindering the usage of multiple processes for faster computation. This paper
proposes a parallelization framework, accounting for the sequential nature while running in parallel.
By dynamically distributing partitions to different processes, we ensure full workload distribution and
minimising idle times for processes. Relative strong and weak scaling efficiencies drop below 80% when
run with more than 3 and 2 workers respectively. We notice that this is partly caused by the fact that the
size of the input data and the amount of work a worker has to perform, do not scale linearly. When scaling
to more workers, we expect to run into a performance bottleneck caused by input output operations of the
root node. Recommendations are made for future research to limit the amount of input output operations
by statically assigning partitions to workers."

Analyse van opdrachten kritisch lezen van zakelijke teksten in methodes Nederlands voor bovenbouw vwo","['Bruijniks, Boet']","['Evers-Vermeul, Jacqueline']",2023-07-27T00:02:16Z,NL,['leesonderwijs; kritisch lezen; Nederlands; middelbare school; lesmethodes; leesvaardigheid; zakelijke teksten;'],Neerlandistiek,"Nederlandse jongeren scoorden in PISA-2018 lager dan andere landen op het begripsproces Evalueren en reflecteren (Gubbels et al., 2019). Verschillende instanties pleiten voor meer aandacht voor kritische omgang met teksten en informatie in het schoolvak Nederlands (Nederlands NU! & sectiebestuur Levende Talen Nederlands, 2018; Ontwikkelteam Nederlands, 2019; Herder et al., 2021; Meesterschap Nederlands, 2018, 2021). In deze scriptie onderzoek ik hoe in methodes Nederlands voor bovenbouw vwo het kritisch lezen van zakelijke teksten momenteel wordt gestimuleerd. Hiermee beantwoord ik de volgende hoofddvraag: In hoeverre komt het kritisch lezen van zakelijke teksten (KLZT) aan bod in methodes Nederlands voor bovenbouw vwo? 

Om deze vraag te kunnen beantwoorden, bepaal ik eerst wat ik versta onder KLZT. Ik definieer kritisch lezen als gede-automatiseerd, (re)constructief proces van besluitvorming in reactie op het lezen van teksten. Ik baseer mij met name op de dissertatie van Koek (2022), waarin is onderzocht hoe literatuuronderwijs kritisch denken kan bevorderen. Volgens Koek wordt kritisch denken gekenmerkt door ten eerste de-automatisering van het denken, en ten tweede door een eigen visie te (re)construeren, oftewel nauwkeurig samenstellen, afwegen en weer bijstellen. In literaire context wordt dit gestimuleerd door de volgende vier soorten activiteiten: het opmerken van opvallendheden in een tekst, het tegendenken van de eigen interpretatie, het verkennen van alternatieve interpretatiemogelijkheden en als laatste het synthetiseren van de verschillende interpretaties tot een weloverwogen en veelzijdige eigen interpretatie. 

Vervolgens ga ik aan de hand van andere bronnen over kritisch denken en lezen na hoe ik dergelijke soorten activiteiten kan opvatten in de context van zakelijke teksten. Op basis hiervan stel ik uit de gevonden aspecten van KLZT een analysemodel samen waarmee opdrachten in methodes Nederlands kunnen worden gecategoriseerd. Ook ga ik ter vergelijking aan de hand van literatuur na welke mogelijkheden er in de schoolvakken geschiedenis en filosofie zijn om kritisch te denken en lezen in de klas, wat ook een breder beeld geeft van de mate kritisch denkonderwijs in het Nederlandse stelsel.

Daarna analyseer ik de werkboeken van vier methodes Nederlands voor bovenbouw vwo, te weten: 
Nieuw Nederlands, Leerwerkboek 4-5-6 vwo (6e ed., Noordhoff)
Op Niveau, Verwerkingsboek 4 vwo (3e ed.) en 5/6 vwo (2e ed., Thieme Meulenhoff)
Talent, Jaarkaternen 4, 5 en 6, 2021-2023 voor vwo/gymnasium (Malmberg)
Kern Nederlands Taal & Cultuur, oefen- en examenboek VWO (1e ed., Boom Uitgevers)

Ik stel een aantal besliscriteria op om de meest relevante delen van de methodes te selecteren. Onderdelen over bijvoorbeeld literaire teksten of luisteren en spreken blijven buiten beschouwing. Ook bepaal ik wat ik in de methodes als ‘opdracht’ beschouw. Vervolgens codeer ik van alle opdrachten in het geselecteerde corpus of ik de opdracht als KLZT-stimulerend beschouw of niet en onder welk aspect van KLZT de opdracht valt. Een tweede beoordelaar doet hetzelfde bij 40 willekeurig gekozen opdrachten uit het corpus. De interbeoordelaarsbetrouwbaarheid blijkt redelijk te zijn. 

Op basis van de codering analyseer ik of de methodes verschillen in de verdeling over de verschillende soorten KLZT-activiteiten. Van de methodes Talent en Op Niveau analyseer ik ook of er verschillen zijn tussen de verschillende jaarlagen. Ook ga ik in een kwalitatieve analyse meer gedetailleerd in op de verschillen tussen de methodes. 

Uit de analyse blijkt dat ongeveer een derde van de opdrachten een aspect van KLZT stimuleert. In Nieuw Nederlands en Op Niveau komen relatief meer KLZT-opdrachten voor dan in Kern en Talent.

Invloed op Roghman en Roghmans invloed op anderen: Geertruydt Roghmans prentreeks 'Vrouwenwerkzaamheden' in context,"['Knarren, Mees']","['Kwakkelstein, Michael']",2023-07-27T00:02:21Z,NL,['vrouwelijke kunstenaar; zeventiende eeuw; achttiende eeuw; feminisme; prenten; genrekunst; vrouwen; toegepaste kunst'],Kunstgeschiedenis,"In deze scriptie wordt onderzocht wat de invloed van Geertruydt Roghmans (1625-1651-57) gravurereeks Vrouwenwerkzaamheden in de zeventiende eeuw is geweest in vergelijking met de invloed van dezelfde reeks in de achttiende eeuw. Dit met een speciale focus op het vrouwbeeld dat Roghman in haar prentreeks ten tonele voert. De invloed van Vrouwenwerkzaamheden op de zeventiende eeuw is onderzocht door Martha Moffitt Peacock, wier argumentatie mij niet volledig overtuigt. Deze zal ik waar mogelijk aanvullen of proberen te weerleggen. De invloed van de reeks in de achttiende eeuw is in het geheel nog nooit onderzocht. Met voorbeelden van navolging in verschillende kunstmedia probeer ik een achttiende-eeuwse navolging van Vrouwenwerkzaamheden te reconstrueren.

In het eerste hoofdstuk wordt er een vergelijking gemaakt tussen Roghman en Judith Leyster (1609-1660), de enige twee vrouwen die tot de zeventiende-eeuwse Nederlandse genrekunstenaars worden gerekend. Hierbij wordt er gefocust op het meer genuanceerde vrouwbeeld dat beide vrouwen in hun werk verbeelden en hun onconventionele gebruik van ruimtelijke aanduiding.

In het tweede hoofdstuk wordt er nagegaan of Roghmans thematiek van huishoudelijk werk binnen de prentkunst inderdaad geen precedenten kent. Door mogelijke voorlopers van Vrouwenwerkzaamheden te reconstrueren wordt Roghmans reeks in een bredere context geplaatst en wordt ook de mate waarin zij brak met eigentijdse beeldconventies duidelijk.

In het derde hoofdstuk wordt Roghmans oeuvre uiteengezet, waarbij de verschillende interpretaties van kunsthistorici tegen elkaar af worden gewogen. Peacocks stelling dat Roghman bewust beperkende vrouwelijke stereotypes in haar prentreeks weerlegt, wat de kunsthistorica duidt als een proto-feministisch statement, wordt in dit hoofdstuk tegen het licht gehouden.

In het vierde hoofdstuk opper ik dat Roghman met haar prentreeks ingespeeld kan hebben op een nog niet eerder nadrukkelijk aangeboorde clientèle voor prentkunst: vrouwen. Door aan te tonen dat vrouwen verantwoordelijk waren voor veel kunstaankopen in de zeventiende eeuw en voorbeelden te geven van vrouwelijke verzamelaars schets ik een beeld van vrouwen binnen de kunstmarkt.

In het vijfde hoofdstuk wordt er nagegaan hoe plausibel Peacocks voorbeelden van visuele ontlening aan Vrouwenwerkzaamheden in de zeventiende eeuw zijn. Naast visuele vergelijkingen tussen Vrouwenwerkzaamheden en de bedoelde schilderijen wordt er nagegaan of er andere bewijzen te vinden zijn van Roghmans veronderstelde wijde verspreiding in de eeuw van vervaardiging.

In het zesde hoofdstuk schets ik aan de hand van gevonden voorbeelden van onomstotelijke visuele ontleningen aan Vrouwenwerkzaamheden een beeld van haar navolging in de achttiende eeuw. Keramieken voorbeelden en getekende voorbeelden worden hierbij behandeld. Daarnaast wordt er aandacht besteed aan een mogelijke internationale invloed van de prentreeks, met een focus op Italië."
Navigating Gender Bias in Resumes: An Investigation of Word and Contextual Embedding Models,"['Aktepe, Malka']","['Bagheri, Ayoub']",2023-07-27T00:01:54Z,EN,['NLP; word-embedding; contextual embedding; resumes; gender'],Applied Data Science,"Resumes constitute an important part of forming an impression of candidate employees during the hiring process. They are shaped by the interplay between societal, personal, and occupational values. One important personal value or norm that shapes the writing style of a resume, is the gender of the candidate employee (Guadagno & Cialdini, 2007). Previous research shows that women tend to communicate in a more communal way, while men tend to communicate in a more agentic way. In our current society, the feminine gender norms (e.g. care) seem to be less in line with occupational values than the masculine gender norms (e.g. competitiveness; Eagly and Karau, 2002). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, previous research has only investigated gender differences in resumes in male-dominated occupations, like IT careers (Parasurama et al., 2022). Therefore, in this research, we have investigated the interrelationship between gender and occupation in careers that are male-dominated, gender-balanced, and female-dominated.

In our first study, we have identified the most important textual features that differentiate resumes written by men from those written by women in more than 1700 resumes (Yang et al., 2022). Our results indicate that women use more communal language in their resumes with words such as ""assist"" or ""care"" being the most predictive ones, while the features that predicted male resumes were clearly agentic or pointed out that they are the ones who apply or have experience in higher positions or technical fields. Examples of those words are ""manager"" or ""engineering"".

In a second study, we tested multiple machine learning algorithms to predict gender from the resume texts in different occupations. We found that all models can predict gender from the resume text. The traditional and word-embedding models alongside DistilBERT perform well in balanced occupations, but fall short when the data was more female- or male-dominated. RoBERTa and Longformer showed steady performance across all occupations demonstrating the capabilities of newer transformer models.

In our third study, we investigated to what extent men and women conform to their respective gender norms and whether this differs across occupations. We found that women communicate significantly less gender-congruently in male-dominated occupations compared to gender-balanced and female-dominated occupations. Similarly, men communicate significantly less gender-congruently in female-dominated occupations compared to gender-balanced and male-dominated occupations. Thus, even though people might experience social and economic penalties if they communicate in a gender-incongruent way, they still use a different communication style depending on the occupational context to which they apply.

To sum up, in this research project, we successfully trained multiple machine learning algorithms to predict gender from textual features in resumes. We found that their performances and predictive scores differ across occupations. In our discussion, we discuss the implications of these results with regard to societal norms and values surrounding gender and occupation and how these influence the hiring process. We argue that our results highlight the need for gender- and context-aware tools to help employers in selecting appropriate candidates for hiring in a fair manner."

were examined. Data from the Digital Youth Project (DiYo) collected in 2016, 2017 and 2018
was used. The sample included 787 adolescents aged between 11 and 16 years old (Mage =
13.15, SD = 0.88). As predicted, results showed that FoMO has a negative effect on
adolescents' life satisfaction over time. No bidirectional relationship was found: Adolescents'
higher life satisfaction did not predict lower levels of FoMO over time. Moreover,
adolescents with higher levels of FoMO had less self-esteem one year later, which seem to
result in lower levels of life satisfaction two years later. However, quality of friendships and
gender did not impact the relationship between FoMO and life satisfaction. Practical
implications are further discussed. Thus, FoMO may lead to a lower life satisfaction and
self-esteem can be considered as an important factor to enhance adolescents’ life satisfaction."

The study utilizes an existing qualitative dataset consisting of 50 interviews to understand the barriers and facilitators to adherence, using the Multidimensional Adherence Model. For this study, 22 interviews were coded using a priori codes based on the SIMB-CIM model and the Multidimensional Adherence Model, which include information, motivation, behavioral skills, and health system organization. In addition to the a priori codes, an inductive thematic analysis was conducted to investigate emerging codes. The study reveals that healthcare providers play a significant role in informing and motivating PLWHIV to initiate and adhere to ART through HIV-related counseling. However, their involvement in supporting behavioral skills for adherence appears to be less pronounced, although counseling after ART initiation can also be beneficial. The findings emphasize the need for improved quality and content of structural HIV-related counseling in South Africa."

De communicatieteams die bij dit onderzoek betrokken zijn vallen onder Team Sociaal: Volksgezondheid (VG), Werk en Inkomen (W&I) en Maatschappelijke Ontwikkeling (MO).
Kennisdelen binnen organisaties speelt een grote rol om goed samen te kunnen werken. Het zorgt voor nieuwe ideeën en ontwikkelingen. Communicatie is hierbij belangrijk, want kennisdelen vraagt om goede en effectieve (interne) communicatie. De behoeften van de werknemers, de doelstellingen van de organisatie en het gebruik van de juiste communicatiemiddelen zijn allemaal factoren die bij kennisdelen van belang zijn.
Vanaf 1 juli 2022 zijn de drie communicatieteams van VG, MO en W&I samengevoegd tot één communicatieteam: Team Sociaal. Dit betekent dat alle adviseurs te maken krijgen met nieuwe kennis van andere communicatieteams, andere opdrachtgevers en projecten. De communicatieteams moeten hun kennis gaan verbreden en vernieuwen. Hiervoor moeten ze kennis met elkaar gaan delen om beter te kunnen samenwerken. De drie communicatieteams hebben allemaal hun eigen werkwijze bij kennisdelen en samenwerken. Dit onderzoek is er dus op gericht om inzicht te krijgen hoe de teams effectief kennis kunnen delen om samen te werken en welke vormen en communicatiemiddelen daarvoor nodig zijn.
Dit onderzoek bestond uit twee deelstudies. De eerste deelstudie was erop gericht om inzicht te krijgen in de behoeften van de werknemers en de evaluatie van de huidige kennisdeling. Hiervoor zijn semigestructureerde interviews gehouden met zes werknemers (twee werknemers per communicatieteam) en de manager. Het doel was om rijke kwalitatieve data op te halen ter voorbereiding van de vragenlijst.
De tweede deelstudie was een vragenlijst die gebaseerd was op de resultaten van de interviews. Het doel van deze vragenlijst was om te achterhalen of de resultaten van de interviews ook onder heel Team Sociaal speelt. In de vragenlijst kwamen de behoeften van werknemers, de evaluatie van de huidige kennisdeling, organisatiecultuur en communicatiemiddelen aan bod.
De resultaten uit de studies wijzen uit dat het gebrek aan expliciete kennis een probleem is binnen Team Sociaal. Er liggen weinig documenten met kennis vast. De meeste kennis is impliciet van aard. Dit verstoort het optimale proces van kennisdelen in een organisatie. Daarbij zijn er geen duidelijke afspraken welk platform gebruikt moet worden voor welke kennis. Niet elke werknemer kan bij elk bestand en niet alles wordt opgeslagen op de gezamenlijke schijven. Ook wordt er veel werkdruk ervaren waardoor kennisdelen niet voor elke werknemer prioriteit heeft. De communicatieteams zitten voor een
aantal werknemers nog verzuild in hun eigen organisatieonderdeel en team. Ook heeft elk communicatieteam een andere werkwijze en manier van samenwerken.
De werknemers hebben vooral behoefte aan overzichten met projecten en expertises van elkaar, dieper in projecten duiken als team met een casuspresentatie, meer bij elkaar te gaan zitten op kantoor en blijven evalueren hoe de kennisdeling verloopt. Ook worden de teamsessies gewaardeerd. De cultuur binnen Team Sociaal is open en vriendelijk en werknemers zijn bereid en bereikbaar voor vragen en advies. De motivatie om kennis te delen is wel aanwezig bij de meeste werknemers. Het liefst zien de werknemers elkaar face-to-face bij een hulpvraag, maken ze gebruik van de mail of bellen ze elkaar. Ook wordt er veel gebruik gemaakt van de gezamenlijke WhatsApp-groep. Veel werknemers geven aan dat de communicatiemiddelen afgestemd worden op de kennisbehoefte en de hulpvraag. Een ingewikkelde kwestie vraagt om persoonlijk en fysiek contact, terwijl een praktische vraag voldoende beantwoord is met een e-mail. Dit komt overeen met de Media Richness Theory.

In-Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy Investigations of Manganese Oxide and Gadolinium Oxide,"['Boer, Roos de']","['Huis, M.A. van']",2023-08-01T00:00:52Z,EN,['In-Situ TEM; Nanoparticles; Nanosheets; Nanofoams; Metal Oxides'],Nanomaterials Science,"Nanomaterials have been widely studied owing to their interesting properties and potential applications. In this thesis, two novel nanomaterials were studied using in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM): (1) MnO nanostructures and (2) Gd2O3 nanofoam. In-situ TEM is used because it enables heating inside the microscope, which allows for real-time viewing of the heating induced changes to the material. The aim of the first part of this thesis was to observe the predicted heating induced square to trigonal lattice transformation in MnO nanosheets. Manganese oxide nanostructures were synthesized using a salt-templating method. Depending on the precursor, this resulted in the formation of either nanoparticles or nanosheets, both of which were heated inside the TEM. The MnO nanoparticles were embedded in amorphous carbon and spontaneously oxidized to Mn3O4 under ambient conditions depending on the thickness of the carbon layer. When heated, the nanoparticles reduced back to MnO, indicating a reversible transformation between MnO and Mn3O4. The synthesized MnO nanosheets transformed from a square lattice to a trigonal lattice at room temperature
as soon as the salt template was removed, thereby confirming the predicted lattice transformation. In addition to manganese oxide nanostructures, gadolinium oxide was synthesized via gel combustion, resulting in highly porous and crystalline nanofoams. The aim of this project was to characterize the porosity and study the formation of the material during combustion synthesis. The material was characterized by physisorption, indicating a large specific surface area of 67 m2/g, and a 3D model of the structure made using electron tomography visualized the interconnected pore structure of the bulk synthesized Gd2O3. The Gd gel was applied to heating chips and heated in-situ and ex-situ to further analyze the synthesis mechanism. The pore structure was highly dependent on the experimental conditions, indicating that the structure could be tuned by varying the temperature and atmosphere during synthesis. Porous Gd2O3 can be used to treat contaminated water and in (photo)catalysis applications, and gel-combustion synthesis is a low-cost and energy-efficient method to synthesize large amounts of this highly porous Gd2O3."

Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a recently discovered histone and non-histone PTM associated with numerous diseases, including acute kidney injury, depression, HIV latency, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Despite the strong correlation of Kcr with multiple diseases, no chemical tools for the in-depth study of this PTM are available yet. Kcr contains an electron-rich α,β-unsaturated bond, representing an excellent selective handle for the radical-mediated thiol-ene click reaction (TEC). Here we present the development of a novel TEC-mediated photochemical approach for the identification of therapeutically relevant histone and non-histone Kcr proteins. We will use a chemoproteomics approach to detect and identify Kcr proteins in different cell lines. Initially, a selective chemical probe will be designed and synthesised; then proteomics studies will be performed for the identification and characterisation of Kcr proteins, thus leading to the first accurate description of the lysine crotonylome and aiding a better understanding of the role of crotonylation in molecular processes. Moreover, the probe will be used for the identification of non-histone Kcr proteins in a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy, leading to the discovery of potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for curing cardiac disease."
Who bears the burden? Rare-variant burden testing in sub-gene units to identify ALS hotspots,"['Zonneveld, Tessa']","['Kenna, Kevin']",2023-07-31T23:00:53Z,EN,['Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; burden testing; rare variants; spatial clustering; functional \ndomains'],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with a large 
genetic component. Many of the variants seen in ALS patients and controls are so rare that a 
potential association between the variant and ALS cannot be detected with genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS). Instead, rare-variant burden (RVB) tests can be used, which 
combine the signal of all variants in a gene into one signal. A potential limitation of this 
technique is that the signal of a group of damaging variants can be weakened by the presence 
of neutral or protective variants in the same gene. Because damaging mutations might occur 
in different densities across the gene, this research aims to reduce the limitation of testing 
neutral and damaging mutations together by using two different methods of grouping variants: 
a functional domain-based method and a spatial clustering method based on the distances 
between variants. Both methods were tested on three ALS-associated genes: SOD1, FUS and
NEK1. The patterns of damaging mutations found in previous studies of SOD1 and FUS were 
replicated, i.e. no hotspots were seen in SOD1, while robust hotspots of rare and ultra-rare 
variants were seen in the C-terminus of FUS. In NEK1, two clusters dependent on single 
intermediate-frequency variants were seen. Additionally, an enrichment of damaging rare 
variants was found at the N-terminus of NEK1. While the spatial clustering method resulted in

ARBOWETGEVING 1998 EN DE ARBEIDSOMSTANDIGHEDEN OP SCHIPHOL
Welke invloed heeft de Arbowet uit 1998 gehad op de arbeidsomstandigheden van het grondpersoneel bij Schiphol in de periode 1998-2022?
 



2 / 43
Samenvatting  
In de zomer van 2022 werd door wilde stakingen op Schiphol door het grondpersoneel pijnlijk duidelijk dat de arbeidsomstandigheden op zijn zachtst gezegd slecht waren. Het personeel moest werken onder een zeer hoge werkdruk, waardoor allerlei richtlijnen met betrekking tot tillen werden overschreden. De vraag die hierbij al snel opdoemt is wie is hier verantwoordelijk voor? In de Arbowet staan richtlijnen die werkgevers en werknemers helpen bij het bevorderen van de gezondheid, welzijn en veiligheid van werknemers. Het is de bedoeling dat werkgevers en werknemers samen concrete regels vaststellen om aan deze richtlijnen te voldoen. Hoewel er wel regels zijn opgesteld, zijn deze bij het grondpersoneel onvoldoende nageleefd en gecontroleerd. In deze Master scriptie wordt onderzocht welke invloed de Arbowet uit 1998 heeft gehad op de arbeidsomstandigheden van het grondpersoneel bij Schiphol in de periode 1998-2022. Hierbij wordt allereerst gekeken naar de totstandkoming van de wet. Vervolgens worden de wijzigingen in de wet na 1998 geanalyseerd. Bij zowel de totstandkoming als latere wijzigingen in de wet valt op dat de verantwoordelijkheid voor de daadwerkelijke regelgeving, uitvoering en naleving van de Arbowet steeds meer in handen is komen te liggen van werkgevers en werknemers en steeds minder in die van de overheid. Dit heeft negatieve gevolgen gehad voor het grondpersoneel op Schiphol. Tot slot wordt de verantwoordelijkheid van Schiphol hierin onderzocht. Vanwege de ingewikkelde contractuele structuren op Schiphol is het namelijk lastig om voor het niet naleven van deze regels een verantwoordelijke aan te wijzen. Bij het analyseren van deze wijzigingen zijn in dit onderzoek drie lacunes in de wetgeving vastgesteld."

Self-reports of patients with central lobe epilepsy","['Sman, Lydia van der']","['Leijten, Frans']",2023-08-01T00:00:54Z,EN,"['Epilepsy, Central Lobe Epilepsy (CLE), Self-suppression methods, Patients’ perception of efficacy of sensory stimulation']",Selective Utrecht Medical Master (SUMMA),"Objective: To collect and evaluate self-suppression methods used by patients with seizures arising from the primary sensorimotor cortex, so-called central lobe epilepsy (CLE), to estimate their efficacy in suppressing focal sensory-motor seizures.
Methods: We interviewed 11 patients with well-established CLE from a presurgical cohort. We determined self-suppression methods of the participants by using a VAS-score questionnaire, a semi-structured interview, and video- recordings of the methods. The descriptions were sorted by theme, with focus on sensory stimulation methods.
Results: 9 of the 11 patients could influence their attacks with empirical methods and 6 of the participants did so by applying some form of sensory stimulation early during the seizure.
Conclusion: Patients’ accounts testify that peripheral stimulation methods can modulate sensorimotor seizures. These non-invasive stimulation methods are a way for patients to manage their disease when other therapeutic measures such as surgery or medication fail. This may open new therapeutic avenues such as the development of a peripheral sensory stimulation device."

The impact of endemic and infectious respiratory disease on the production performance of growing pigs – a systematic review,"['Fang, Zicheng']","['Nielen, Mirjam']",2023-08-08T00:01:07Z,EN,[],Epidemiology,"Abstract
Background
Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) is now regularly used to describe multifactorial clinical porcine respiratory disease caused by individual infections or coinfections of viruses and bacteria. As one of the most prevalent health issues in domestic pigs, respiratory disease shows impacts on pig production performance like average daily gain (ADG), mortality and feed conversion rate (FCR). Impacts of different pathogen infections were previously studied separately on individual cases, did not map the difference between (co-)infections, different pathogens, epidemic or endemic scenarios and geographic locations. Results from different studies are heterogeneous, making it challenging to accurately assess the true impacts of disease and develop effective pathogen prevention strategies. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to identify studies carried out on the impact of infectious respiratory disease on the production performance of nursery and fattening pigs, to identify impacts of single pathogen infection and co-existing PRDC pathogens, to identify variations across continents, genotypes and disease scenarios.
Results
By following PRISMA method, a total of 38 studies were considered as eligible for this systematic review. The main findings in this review were: 1) The studies were conducted in 17 different countries, including European, North American, Asian countries and Brazil; 2) M. hyopneumoniae and PRRSV were the most studied pathogens, while SIV, PCV2 and A. pleuropneumoniae were mostly studied in coinfection cases; 3) Comparability of impacts on production performance was limited due to the lack of evidence regarding the baseline production parameters, inadequate information on disease history, and the absence of genotype and other pathogens detection; 4) It is difficult to attribute the change of production parameters to specific pathogen single infection or coinfection; 5) Epidemic infections seem to induce higher mortality in pig herds than endemic infections; 6) Coinfections did not show significantly different impacts on production parameters compared to single pathogen infections.
Discussion
This systematic review gives insight into the distribution and focus of respiratory disease research in pigs across different regions and highlights the need for more studies with detailed baseline production performance, pathogen genotype detection and investigation of coinfection scenarios. Further research can be conducted in the potential differences in impacts on performance between international production systems."

What often happens after a revolution, is that the military organisation is also drastically rearranged to encompass the revolution’s ideology. This is exactly what happened in the Batavian Republic. In this thesis, I argue that this transition period between the ancien régime’s Staatse Leger and the revolutionary Bataafse Leger consisted of the deprivatisation of its military entrepreneurs, the centralisation of the military administration, and the nationalisation of the troops themselves. All of these radical changes in the organisation of the Dutch army can be traced back to the ideologies of the Patriot, French and Batavian Revolutions. This study thus confirms the strong intertwinement between these revolutions, which has been debated heavily over the last centuries. Moreover, these conclusions also add a new perspective to the much-discussed current trend in modern warfare in which military tasks are once again regularly outsourced to foreign professionals which brings along grave consequences. This study aims to shine a light on how the Dutch state once before turned this tide by taking control of its own army during the Batavian Revolution."
Mind over matter: Examining the impact of beliefs on impulse control and cognitive failures in leading a healthy lifestyle,"['Schout, Julia']","['Rooij, Daan van']",2023-08-08T00:01:11Z,EN,['Healthy behaviors Impulsivity; Inhibition; Cognitive beliefs; Lifestyle; Attentional capacity; Healthy lifestyle beliefs'],Applied Cognitive Psychology,"Health awareness and attitudes towards healthy lifestyles play a vital role in overall well-being and comfort. Understanding the factors that drive healthy behaviors is crucial for promoting positive lifestyle choices. This study examines the relationships between behavioral disinhibition, impulsivity, cognitive beliefs, and their influence on impulsive behavior, lifestyle, and diet.
 	The research hypotheses posit negative associations between impulsivity and lifestyle/diet, positive associations between inhibition and lifestyle/diet, and a moderating effect of healthy lifestyle beliefs on inhibition and lifestyle/diet.
 	A convenience sample of 50 participants over 18 years of age, proficient in English, and free from visual or auditory impairments was recruited. The study consisted of a questionnaire phase where participants completed measures of healthy lifestyle beliefs (HLBS), mental health (GHQ), dietary habits (FFQ), and impulsivity (BIS). This was followed by a laboratory phase involving the Stop-Signal task to assess attentional ability (MRTV) and inhibitory control (SSRT).
 	Methodological adjustments were made during the study, leading to the removal of non-significant variables (BIS, FFQ) and refining the statistical model to investigate the relationships between HLBS, GHQ, SSRT, and MRTV. The analysis revealed that only the coefficient estimate for MRTV was statistically significant (p = .03). These findings indicate that neither the interaction between GHQ and SSRT nor the moderation of MRTV had a substantial impact on individuals' healthy lifestyle beliefs (HLBS). Additionally, there was no significant interaction effect between GHQ, SSRT, MRTV, and HLBS.
 	The discussion and conclusion provide an interpretation of the findings. The study did not find support for the relationship between GHQ, SSRT, and HLBS, nor did the moderation of MRTV yield significant results. However, the results did reveal a significant positive association between MRTV and HLBS. This positive association underscores the importance of cognitive flexibility in promoting engagement in healthy lifestyle activities. The findings suggest that individuals with greater attentional capacity are more likely to adopt and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
 	In summary, this study sheds light on the complex interplay between behavioral disinhibition, impulsivity, cognitive beliefs, and their impact on impulsive behavior, lifestyle, and diet. The positive association between attentional capacity (MRTV) and healthy lifestyle beliefs highlights the role of cognitive flexibility in promoting healthy behaviors. These findings contribute to our understanding of the factors influencing healthy lifestyle choices and have implications for interventions aimed at promoting healthier lifestyles."

However, to realize the goal Dutch municipalities rely on the cooperation of homeowners. Despite implementing financial policies and a generally positive attitude towards the green transition, only a fraction of homeowners commits to the necessary changes annually. This study investigates the role of social cohesion in bridging the gap between attitudes and actions.

Building upon Schiefer and van der Noll's (2016) framework of social cohesion, this study examines the impact of social networks, trust, social capital, attachment/belonging, and social norms on sustainable action. Statistical analysis was conducted using data from 2342 homeowners in Utrecht and Zeist, allowing a comprehensive examination of these factors.

Our findings demonstrate that when homeowners know a neighbor who has already made their home energy-efficient, the likelihood of their own adoption significantly increases. This ""Spreading Effect"" is discussed and followed by a proposed strategy to harness and leverage the effect for promoting the energy transition."

Recent studies have shown a possible association between the age related accumulation of advanced glycated end products (AGEs) and the development of frailty in the elderly. AGEs are associated with the onset of several (chronic) diseases through the induction of inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and altered cell signalling. The accumulation of AGEs can be measured in skin using autofluorescence spectroscopy. With this review we show that AGE levels in skin show a positive correlation with several physical frailty components, especially low hand grip strength, declining muscle mass, and exhaustion. The association of AGE levels with commonly used frailty measures, namely Fried’s criteria and the Frailty Index, was present in some, but not all, included studies. Similar results were found for prediction of frailty by assessing AGE levels. There were only few studies investigating the relationship between cognitive frailty and AGE levels, but they show a strong confounding effect of cardiovascular disease. So far, determining AGE levels in skin shows promise as a non-invasive marker of physical frailty, but for especially for investigating prospective frailty and cognitive frailty, AGE levels should first be measured in larger, and especially longitudinal, cohorts."

However, little is known about the attitudes of children regarding translanguaging in the classroom. Children can have certain attitudes towards translanguaging, which may be influenced by various predictors. It is important to gain a more comprehensive view on which factors can influence children’s attitudes towards translanguaging, as it allows us to further develop and shape the translanguaging pedagogy that is currently used in Dutch education. It could also aid us in improving children’s attitudes towards translanguaging, which in turn can enhance how these children learn. Thus, the main objective of the current study was to examine whether gender, multilingualism, global self-esteem and academic self-esteem are predicting factors for children’s attitudes towards translanguaging in the classroom. Age was also added as a covariate. Forty-four Dutch children between the ages of eight and twelve participated by filling in an online questionnaire. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was then conducted to analyse whether the variables were significant predictors. Age, gender, multilingualism and global self-esteem were not significant predictors for children’s attitudes towards translanguaging. Academic self-esteem was a significant predictor. This implies that a higher level of academic self-esteem predicts a more positive attitude towards translanguaging in children."

Introduction: This study investigated whether parental
stress (measured at 18 months) influences socialemotional
problems of the child (measured at 24
months), and whether birth status (moderate to late
premature vs. a-term) influences this relationship.
Method: Existing data from the study 'Study on Attention
of Preterm children' was used for this research. The
sample consisted of 202 parents with their children, of
which 108 were born moderately to late preterm and 94
were term born. The participants in this study were
recruited by paediatricians in Dutch hospitals. Parents
completed the Nijmeegse Ouderlijke Stress Index
(NOSIK) to measure parental stress and the Ages and
Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional (ASQ-SE) to
measure their children's social-emotional development.
Results: The regression analyses revealed a significant
positive association between scores on the NOSIK and
ASQ-SE (b = .23, t = 3.24, p = .001).. The moderator
had no significant influence on this association. Education
level of the mother was found to be related to
socialemotional problems. Conclusion/discussion:
Parental stress negatively influences the socialemotional
development of two-year-olds. This relationship does not
appear to be different for moderately to late preterm
infants compared to term borns. In practice, these
results can be used to screen parents for perceived
parental stress so that this does not harm (early)
socialemotional development. Follow-up research can use
other instruments to limit social desirability, better
ensure external validity by acquiring participants in other locations and include a more equal distribution of education levels.
Abstract Nederlands
Inleiding: In dit onderzoek is onderzocht of ouderlijke stress (gemeten op 18 maanden) invloed heeft op sociaal-emotionele problemen van het kind (gemeten op 24 maanden), en of geboortestatus (matig tot laat prematuur vs. a-term) invloed heeft op dit verband. Methode: Voor dit onderzoek is bestaande data gebruikt van het onderzoek ‘Study on Attention of Preterm children’. De steekproef bestond uit 202 ouders met hun kinderen, waarvan 108 matig tot laat prematuur geboren kinderen en 94 a-term geboren kinderen. De participanten zijn geworven door kinderartsen in Nederlandse ziekenhuizen. Ouders hebben de Nijmeegse Ouderlijke Stress Index (NOSIK) ingevuld om ouderlijke stress te meten en de Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional (ASQ-SE) om de sociaal-emotionele ontwikkeling van hun kinderen te meten. Resultaten: Uit de regressieanalyses is gebleken dat er een significant positief verband tussen NOSIK-scores en ASQ-SE-scores bestaat (b = .23, t = 3.24, p = .001). De moderator zwangerschapsstatus had geen significante invloed op dit verband. Opleidingsniveau van de moeder bleek gerelateerd te zijn aan de sociaal-emotionele problemen. Conclusie/discussie: Geconcludeerd kan worden dat ouderlijke stress negatieve invloed heeft op de sociaal-emotionele ontwikkeling van tweejarigen. Dit verband lijkt niet anders voor matig tot laat prematuur geboren kinderen. Met deze resultaten kan men in de praktijk ouders screenen op ervaren ouderlijke stress zodat dit de (vroege) sociaal-emotionele ontwikkeling niet ten kwade komt. Vervolgonderzoek kan andere instrumenten gebruiken om sociale wenselijkheid te beperken, externe validiteit beter te waarborgen door participanten te verwerven op andere locaties en een gelijkere verdeling van opleidingsniveaus mee te nemen."
COVID-19 Vaccines and the Misclassification of Adverse Events,"['Holtari, Riikka']","['Eijkemans, René']",2023-08-10T00:05:00Z,EN,[],Epidemiology,"In order to evaluate the impact of outcome misclassification on the possible causal association 
between Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) and COVID-19 vaccination, we conducted 
a literature review and a simulation study. The literature study aimed to obtain a plausible range 
of outcome misclassification indices of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding 
systems used in electronic healthcare databases.
We used logistic regression to contrast a naïve estimator that disregards misclassification 
with a misclassification-integrating Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) model to explore
the relationship between vaccine exposure and the occurrence of AESIs. The MLE model 
employed marginal probability from a Bernoulli distribution to account for misclassification, 
facilitating a comparison of log of odds ratios and relative risks between the models. 
In our simulation study, we generated data which incorporated a fixed vaccination rate, 
varying sample sizes, regression coefficients, and misclassification rates to evaluate bias and 
mean squared error (MSE) of the log of odds ratio and the relative risk. The analyses showed that
the MLE model exhibited reduced bias under high prevalence and specificity conditions when 
examining the relative risk bias. Despite its great variability, the MLE model outperformed the 
naïve estimator in specific simulations with increased association strengths, supporting our 
hypothesis. Our findings reveal a need for rigorous methodologies to address misclassification in 
vaccine safety assessments and indicate that the degree of misclassification may be significant, 
depending on the specific ICD code.
Our research highlighted the importance of thoroughly recognising misclassified data and 
outlined critical areas for future research in epidemiology. Our observations demonstrated that 
the traditional approach, which disregards the subsequent bias brought on by misclassification –
is not fundamentally flawed, emphasising the need to investigate how and when these errors can 
be significant."
Investigating the illusion of an equal world: The moderating roles of system justification beliefs and gender identification in the Queen Bee phenomenon,"['Obalar, Birsu']","['Veldman, Jenny']",2023-08-10T00:04:07Z,EN,[],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","The study at hand sought to replicate the study of Derks et al. (2011b) and expand the literature on the queen bee (QB) phenomenon by examining the possible moderating role of system justification beliefs (SJB). As women continue to reach positions of power increasingly, the barriers put in place are becoming more evident. One barrier is related to the perception of gender bias and discrimination. Women who recognise gender bias and discrimination within their organisations could disengage themselves from other women to advance further (Derks et al., 2011a). This is also known as queen bee behaviour, and it can lead to women defending the status quo, enforcing gender stereotypes, and decreasing advancement opportunities for other women. In line with this, we hypothesized that the relationship between gender bias and QB behaviours would be stronger when women identified lowly with their gender, and when they have high SJB. The current study examined 96 female managers across different companies and nationalities through an online experiment where they were either reminded of the existence of gender bias or not. The findings were mixed for both hypotheses, where only the denial of discrimination was in line with expectations for the first hypothesis. Additionally, only ingroup distancing had a marginally significant interaction, but the main effects were insignificant, thus the second hypothesis was not supported. Recommendations for future research and practical implications are discussed."

The Ocean Cleanup is an ambitious nonprofit organization focused on removing legacy plastic from oceans and, more recently, rivers. Such missions demand transformative change. To evaluate the transformative success of The Ocean Cleanup’s river deployments, this study utilizes transformative outcomes, a concept within the Transformation Innovation Policy (TIP) framework. The goals of this study are to identify the presence of transformative outcomes in the river deployments and derive recommendations based on these outcomes. An additional aspect of this study is to provide advice for how The Ocean Cleanup can also leverage the (transformative) social impacts of its river deployments. Overall, this research aims to promote The Ocean Cleanup’s progress towards its mission. Using a deductive, qualitative, and formative approach, this research assesses the transformative outcomes and social impacts across four of The Ocean Cleanup’s river deployments - the United States, Malaysia, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic. The results reveal the importance of nurturing and building niches, expanding and mainstreaming niches, and expanding and unlocking regimes in achieving transformative success, although the latter process is less observed. Beyond this, the study highlights the influence of socio-technical contexts (place), types and number of solutions deployed (level), and timelines (time) on the transformation process itself. Additionally, this study provides insight into the role of The Ocean Cleanup as a non-state actor, showcasing its influence beyond local-level impacts.

both inside and outside of a hospital setting. Here, I assess the impact of medical, birdsong, and 
music soundscapes on the recall of numerals projected on a monitor for 210 ms before being 
masked. Recall of such briefly presented items may tap into “immediate” or “iconic” memory 
(Sperling, 1960). Participants completed the memory task while being exposed to one of three pre-recorded soundscapes: birdsong, a Mozart sonata, or a medical soundscape. A 2x3 design was 
used, where sound condition (sound versus silence) was the within-participant manipulation and the 
between-group variable was the soundscape type. Following task completion, participants 
completed a questionnaire asking about their perceived workload of the task in silence versus 
sound, and their pleasantness rating of their respective soundscape. The questionnaire also 
included items that addressed individual sensory-processing sensitivity, prior experience listening to 
soundscapes while working, and prior experience in a hospital setting. A repeated measures 
analysis of variance showed no statistically significant difference in accuracy scores between all 
three groups of soundscapes and no interaction effect between the score difference in silence 
versus sound and soundscape type. Despite the medical soundscape’s rating as the most 
unpleasant soundscape, its perceived workload scores were the lowest. This finding may be 
attributable to the type of task or auditory stimuli used."

US parents (N = 241) of children aged 5, 6 or 7 years (42% girls) were presented with scenarios illustrating children's internalising emotions and were asked to imagine their own child in the scenarios. Parents were then asked about their attributions of the causes of the child's emotions and their hypothetical response (normalising their child’s reaction or providing emotional support) in each situation. The results show that there are no gender differences in parental attributions and supportive responses of parents. However, when parents made more internal attributions about their children’s internalising emotions, this was associated with more supportive reactions. This result shows the role that attributions play in parents' responses. It is important to make parents aware of this attribution process to encourage parental support, regardless of the child's gender."

Results showed a weak, but significant, positive relationship between the enforcement of rules and symptoms of gaming addiction, suggesting that strict rule-setting alone may be insufficient in effectively combating gaming addiction. The quality of communication between parents and young people demonstrated a stronger link to gaming addiction, as compared to the influence of rules, indicating that fostering effective communication could be a potentially more effective strategy. The hypothesis that the quality of communication would serve as a moderator in the relationship between rules and gaming addiction was not confirmed. This study reveals that the impact of parental rules and communication on gaming addiction is complex and may be influenced by other factors, such as parental involvement or child self-regulation (Ryzin et al., 2009). Limitations of this study include the use of self-developed measurement instruments and the cross-sectional nature of the research. Future research could focus on a more extensive set of factors, the use of longitudinal designs, and multi-informant approaches. Despite these limitations, the study underscores the importance of parent-child communication in the context of internet use and gaming addiction among young people and suggests the necessity of a broader approach in addressing problematic gaming behavior. This implies that interventions should not only focus on individual gamers, but also on the wider social context in which they exist."

Door middel van een analyse op een gedetailleerd tekstniveau en voor grote delen van een tekst wordt getracht een completer beeld van focalisatie te bewerkstelligen. Daarnaast zou het automatisch herkennen van focalisatie het mogelijk maken om de diachrone ontwikkeling van het concept te bestuderen. De hoofdvraag in dit onderzoek is: ‘Hoe kan focalisatie computationeel onderzocht worden?’

Hiertoe is focalisatie beschreven in vier aspecten: positie van het focaliserende subject, waarneembaarheid van het gefocaliseerde object, aantal objecten en gedetailleerdheid van de waarneming. Een corpus van 1000 romanfragmenten is vervolgens met de hand geannoteerd voor deze aspecten. Enerzijds diende het annoteren als close reading met eigen onderzoeksresultaten, anderzijds is op basis van de annotaties een computermodel getraind op het herkennen van de verschillende aspecten van focalisatie. Vervolgens zijn verschillende manieren vergeleken om de fragmenten numeriek te representeren en zijn logistische regressie en het Nederlandstalige BERT-model ingezet voor de training.

Uit de resultaten van de systematische lezing is gebleken dat interne waarnemers bijzonder vaak voorkomen, terwijl de gedachten van personages niet zo sterk aanwezig zijn als zou worden verwacht van interne waarnemers. Ook worden gefocaliseerde objecten in hoge mate met veel detaillering waargenomen. Gedetailleerdheid blijkt daarbij in hoge mate vatbaar voor interpretatie. Ambiguïteit is daarnaast eerder regel dan uitzondering wanneer focalisatie systematisch wordt onderzocht. Bovendien is de schaal van analyseren een belangrijke factor; wordt focalisatie bestudeerd op hoofdstukniveau, dan levert dat andere resultaten op dan voor fragmenten van 150 woorden.

Het automatisch herkennen van onder meer interne focalisators komt dicht in de buurt van de menselijke oordelen. Het aspect van waarneembaarheid leent zich bovendien goed voor toepassing op onbekende teksten. Een aantal aspecten scoort echter minder goed, waarmee onder meer de complexiteit van lees- en begripsprocessen wordt bevestigd. Gezien de verkennende aard van dit onderzoek leveren de modellen al met al een positief resultaat op. Bovendien maakt dit onderzoek inzichtelijk hoezeer de menselijke hand voortdurend aanwezig is in computationeel onderzoek en dat de schijn van objectiviteit van computers vaak onterecht is."
Analysing the Dynamics of a Global Innovation System: A Case Study on Green Methanol as a Marine Fuel,"['Snijders, Cas']","['Loos, Adriaan van der']",2023-08-17T00:01:03Z,EN,['Global Innovation System; Innovation System; Alternative Fuels; Methanol; E-Methanol; Green Methanol; Bio-Methanol; Marine Fuel;'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Abstract

Introduction
This research analyses the drivers and barriers to the global adoption of green methanol as a marine fuel, which is a fuel that offers a vital decarbonization solution to the maritime industry. The research builds on the Global Innovation Systems (GIS) theory since this theoretical framework showcases the essential activities needed for an innovation system to get to a more footloose adoption state.
Methods
Innovation systems thrive through stakeholders' pursuit of impactful events. To understand the prominent activities that occurred in the green methanol industry, an event history analysis was conducted. A global news analysis examined the temporal frequency of events and their correlation with the GIS resources. And in addition, semi-structured interviews with ten experts in the field enriched the understanding of the dynamics in the industry, leading to a robust dataset for a coherent narrative.
Results
The study presents a narrative that spans over five distinctive periods, illustrating the shifts in GIS maturation pathways and development barriers over time. The green methanol industry undergoes a transformative journey from a spatially sticky racing fuel in the United States to an innovative, globally recognized maritime fuel used to decarbonize the industry. 
By focusing on the flaws in the innovation system, the research formulates a range of policy recommendations that are essential for the green fuel to become more widely mature. These recommendations hold the potential to upscale the adoption of the innovation and thereby mitigate emissions.
Discussion
While the research successfully achieved its objectives, it also highlights several areas for future investigation. Emphasizing that the parameters encompassed by the GIS theory do not fully capture the feedback loops of an innovation system. Additionally, it underscores the importance of thoughtfully selecting the event history analysis methodology, as outcomes may not always align with desired objectives. Moreover, the study suggests that future GIS studies can benefit from deconstructing the value chain of complex innovations, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the different components influencing maturity within the system.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this research makes substantial contributions by its unparalleled scope, valuable policy recommendations, and insights into the flaws and prospective directions of GIS studies, firmly establishing its academic and social significance. Ultimately providing a solid foundation for policymakers and industry stakeholders in the green methanol sector to enhance their industry practices and facilitate further development of the fuel."

Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) provide a framework for understanding the diffusion and development of clean technologies in developed countries. For developing countries, however, researchers suggest an extended version of the TIS framework accounting for the characteristics of developing countries. On top of this, researchers claim that there is a need for exploring how established sectors may influence the development and diffusion of clean technologies. Prior research on developing country’s TIS did not emphasize on how the established sector may influence the diffusion and development of technologies in the formative phase. Accordingly, this paper studies how the established sector (HVAC/R industry) influences the diffusion of heat pumps in Turkey. Through desktop research and 28 semi-structured interviews with relevant actors, the analysis examines the influence of the HVAC/R sector on the extended TIS framework for developing countries. The findings of study, shows that special emphasise should be given to creating conditions that create industrial space for the TIS in developing countries since the production activities found to be highly critical for their TISs. Furthermore, it is observed during the formative stage of clean technologies in a developing country, the structural overlaps between sector and focal TIS significantly impact TIS functions. The infrastructure overlap, network overlap and formal institutions positively influence the knowledge development and diffusion and these overlaps ease the path of diversifying from HVAC/R to HP. However, the overlapping actors influence the expectations and activities to legitimize the HPs negatively since there is a lack of commitment and misalignment inside the sector. Thus, this study shows that while the infrastructural overlaps created opportunities for TIS based in developing countries, these positive influences do not lead to market growth or vision to diffuse a clean technology. To address these challenges and diffuse clean technologies in developing countries, this paper shed light on the importance of creating conditions that enable formation of industrial space to capitalize the market demand, even though there is no adequate domestic market size."
Heeft de Europese Unie een levensvatbare wijze van bestuur?,"['Doesburg, Joost van']","['Behrisch, Lars']",2023-08-17T00:00:40Z,NL,['EU; HHR; Europese Unie; Heilige Roomse Rijk; Gouden Bul 1356; Verdrag van Maastricht 1993; Godsdienstvrede van Augsburg 1555; Peter Haldén;'],Geschiedenis van Politiek en Maatschappij,"In dit onderzoek staat de vraag of er overeenkomsten zijn in het staatsbestel tussen het Heilige Roomse Rijk in de periode 1356-1555 en de Europese Unie ten tijde van 1992 en wat vertellen die overeenkomsten ons over de levensvatbaarheid van de EU centraal? Er wordt met vier factoren: a) de status van de lidstaten b) de relatie tussen de eenheden c) hun relaties tot een ‘centrum’ en tot slot d) hun relatie tot externe systemen en actoren, een analyse gemaakt van de levensvatbaarheid van het staatsbestel van het HRR en de EU. Deze factoren zijn afkomstig van Peter Haldén. Er wordt gekeken naar drie verdragen, de Gouden bul van 1356, de Godsdienstvrede van Augsburg van 1555 en tot slot het Verdrag van Maastricht van 1992. Op basis van de analyse kan gesteld worden dat de theorie van Haldén bevestigd wordt en dat de EU levensvatbaarder is dan het HRR. In veel van de categorieën scoort de EU beter dan het HRR. Daarmee wil nog niet gezegd worden dat de EU daarmee een bestuursvorm is die net zo lang kan bestaan als het HRR dat kon. Er zijn altijd externe systemen of actoren die dat kunnen bedreigen. Zo werd met het Verdrag van Maastricht de weg vrijgemaakt voor een uitbreiding in de breedte van de EU maar nam daarmee de politisering toe. Voor het systeem dat wilde voortbestaan was de nieuwe balans ongunstiger maar verzekerde dat wel haar voortbestaan. Dat de EU beter scoort dan het HRR is geen signaal aan de EU om op haar lauweren te gaan rusten. Als de EU de levensvatbaarheid verder wil verbeteren zullen er aanpassingen nodig zijn."
De kracht van duurzaamheidscommunicatie,"['Spierenburg, Lysanne']","['Winnubst, Madelinde']",2023-08-17T00:00:46Z,EN,[],"Communicatie, beleid en management","Om klimaatverandering tegen te gaan en de wereld te verduurzamen, zijn veel organisaties duurzaamheidsinitiatieven gestart. Deze duurzaamheidsinitiatieven worden bijvoorbeeld door campagnes via tekens, zoals woorden, beelden en geluiden, bij burgers onder de aandacht gebracht (Chandler, 2017). Het communiceren via tekens over duurzaamheidsinitiatieven wordt duurzaamheidscommunicatie genoemd en omvat alle communicatie-uitingen die gerelateerd zijn aan sociale en ecologische betrokkenheid van een organisatie (Klanten et al., 2012). Omdat uit cijfers van het CBS blijkt dat jongeren minder duurzaam leven dan ouderen en er nog geen onderzoek is gedaan naar de rol van tekens in duurzaamheidscommunicatie ten opzichte van het aanmoedigen van duurzaam leven onder jongeren, luidt de onderzoeksvraag van dit onderzoek als volgt: “Wat is de rol van tekens in de duurzaamheidscommunicatie van IKEA ‘Duurzaamheid – stap voor stap groener’ bij middelbaar- en hoogopgeleide jongeren tussen de 20 en 25 jaar?” In het literatuuronderzoek staan de concepten duurzaamheidscommunicatie, informerende, persuasieve en motiverende communicatie – met een focus op determinanten van gedrag zoals besproken in het TRA – en semiotiek centraal. Om antwoord te kunnen geven op de onderzoeksvraag is in dit onderzoek een semiotische analyse uitgevoerd en zijn er semigestructureerde interviews afgenomen bij acht middelbaaropgeleide en acht hoogopgeleide jongeren tussen de 20 en 25 jaar.
Uit dit onderzoek zijn verschillende resultaten voortgekomen. Ten eerste identificeren middelbaaropgeleide jongeren een andere boodschap in de video dan hoogopgeleide jongeren. Dit is te verklaren door het feit dat hoogopgeleide jongeren sterker betrokken zijn bij duurzaamheid en daardoor meer kennis hebben. Daarnaast riepen tekens in de video zoals het kind met het plastic flesje en de achtergrondmuziek bij het merendeel van de respondenten positieve gevoelens op. De afvalstroom in de video was voor middelbaaropgeleide jongeren lastig te interpreteren, waardoor ze er een negatieve connotatie aan toekenden. Uit de resultaten blijkt ook dat middelbaar- en hoogopgeleide jongeren een verschillende houding ten opzichte van duurzaamheid hebben. Bij het evalueren van hun houding, reflecteren middelbaaropgeleide jongeren vooral op welke milieugedragingen zij uitvoeren en hoogopgeleide jongeren reflecteren vooral op de kennis die zij hebben over het onderwerp. Daarnaast heeft het interview bij meeste respondenten geleid tot bewustwording en is de waargenomen norm onder de respondenten om duurzaam te leven hoog. Tot slot geven middelbaaropgeleide jongeren aan sneller duurzaam te zullen handelen vanwege het zien van mensen in de video. Hoogopgeleide jongeren geven aan dat het zien van mensen in de video hen in mindere mate beïnvloedt. Om deze reden is de conclusie van dit onderzoek dat tekens in de duurzaamheidscommunicatie van IKEA een informatieve, persuasieve en motiverende rol hebben.
Aanbevelingen voor vervolg onderzoek zijn kwantitatief onderzoek waarbij de overtuigingskracht van de verschillende rollen van tekens in duurzaamheidscommunicatie onderzocht kan worden. Daarnaast wordt een replicaonderzoek aanbevolen omdat klimaatverandering een steeds urgenter wordt. Hierdoor worden steeds meer mensen bewust van de impact van hun handelen op de toekomst van de aarde."
The Impact of University Well-Being Programs Emphasizing Individual Responsibility for Burnout on Self-Stigma,"['Uzdraitė, Deina']","['Versteegt, Lisanne']",2023-08-17T00:00:49Z,EN,['academic burnout; university well-being programs; self-stigma; responsibility attributions'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","This study examined the effects of university well-being programs’ responsibility attributions of burnout (individual vs. organizational) on self-stigmatization and investigated if individuals with burnout show higher levels of self-stigma. The sample was university students in the Netherlands (N = 125) aged between 18 and 36 years. The study adopted a between-subjects design allocating participants to either one of the two experimental manipulation conditions: 1) individual responsibility or 2) organizational responsibility of burnout. Measures for the self-stigma were obtained using the self-stigma subscale from the Stigma and Self-Stigma Scales (SASS) whereas burnout was measured using Maslach Burnout Inventory for students. Results revealed that higher levels of self-stigmatization are observed when participants are exposed to a university well-being program emphasizing the individual, as compared to organizational responsibility for burnout. However, no moderating effects of the experience of burnout were observed in the proposed relationship. These results add substantial new insights to the current literature on university well-being programs’ implementation which suggests a new area for further research."
Simplifying the Complex: Strategies to reduce existing API Complexity using CPS techniques,"['Nolst Trenité, Thomas']","['Kosch, T.A.']",2023-06-20T00:00:46Z,EN,['software;complexity;api;comprehension;developer experience;hci;complex problem solving;'],Human-Computer Interaction,"Software development plays a crucial role in driving technological advancements
and fostering innovation across industries. However, the ever-increasing complexity in software systems poses significant challenges. This research aims to explore
the origins of software complexity and develop strategies to mitigate it. Specifically,
it investigates software complexity through the lens of Complex Problem Solving
(CPS) and Software Comprehension, areas that have received limited attention thus
far. The study focuses on API integration, a common area of software development,
and examines two strategies (strategy A and B). These strategies incorporate the CPS
techniques decomposition and Lean Thinking to address different dimensions of complexity inherent in API software. In a user study (N=30), participants had to retrieve
data from an API platform and use it to build small conceptual prototype applications. Metrics related to time, successfulness in task and (perceived) effectiveness were utilized to assess the impact of the strategies on reducing interface and
system complexity. The findings reveal how strategy A significantly reduces task
completion times and the time required for the initial API call. Moreover, strategy
A demonstrates superior performance compared to the baseline in metrics related
to complexity. This highlights the effectiveness of concepts from Lean Thinking in
reducing software complexity. Strategy B shows promising results in supporting
developers’ individual completion of API integration tasks and facilitating software
comprehension by providing tailored learning materials suitable for common-sense
learners. On the whole, developers expressed high levels of satisfaction with the
effectiveness of both strategies in achieving their respective goals. This research
establishes a foundation for enhanced interaction with complex software systems,
opening avenues for future studies to explore more effective support strategies. The
outcomes contribute to the advancement of software development practices and offer valuable insights for improving ease of use and reducing complexity in software
systems."

The Influence of Labelling and Dietary Preferences on Consumers’ Willingness to Buy Plant-Based Meat-Alternatives,"['Swartjes, Merel']","['Driessen, Josi']",2023-08-24T00:01:00Z,EN,[],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","The plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs) market has grown tremendously, driven by increasing consumer demand. Eating plant-based has been associated with several benefits, including environmental benefits. Considering these benefits in light of the current climate crisis emphasizes the importance to shift away from meat consumption towards a more plant-based diet. Many PBMAs were developed to resemble meat products and have been marketed under similar denominations (Domke, 2018). However, this meat-based labelling of PBMAs has sparked a debate. For instance, meat producers argue against this labelling, stating that PBMAs cannot be confused with meat products (Demartini et al., 2022). This study aimed to contribute to this debate and build upon Demartini et al. (2022) by examining the impact of PBMAs’ labelling on consumers’ willingness to buy these products. Participants’ willingness to buy PBMAs was assessed using a 2 (Label: Meat-based, Plant-based) x 3 (Dietary preference: Meat-eaters, Flexitarians, Vegetarians/vegans) repeated measures ANOVA design. The findings indicated that PBMAs with a meat-based label, compared to a plant-based label, elicited a higher willingness to buy. Moreover, vegetarians/vegans exhibited the highest willingness to buy PBMAs, followed by flexitarians, while meat-eaters displayed the lowest willingness. An interaction effect revealed that the impact of labelling on willingness to buy PBMAs varied across these dietary preference groups. These results have implications for both the meat and PBMA industries, providing insights into food labelling and consumer preferences. Additionally, this study highlights the need for further research in this area, and alternative explanations and suggestions for future research are discussed."
