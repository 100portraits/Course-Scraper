Prediction of development of immune mediated inflammatory diseases with antinuclear antibodies,"['Heuvel, Hélène van den']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-06-21T00:00:33Z,EN,[],Infection and Immunity,"Immune mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are inflammatory conditions that are currently incurable. The treatment options currently used include corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologicals. As IMIDs can cause significant tissue damage when untreated, early diagnosis is essential. This proves to be a challenge, as clinical manifestations vary largely between patients. One of the potential diagnostic tools could be antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). This is a group of various autoantibodies that target nuclear molecules. Some of these ANAs are exclusively associated with particular IMIDs. In addition, previous literature has demonstrated ANAs are present years prior to clinical diagnosis of the IMID. In light of these findings, the current thesis aims to explore the predictive value of positive ANA screening tests and specific ANA tests for development of IMIDs within six years following a positive ANA screening test or specific ANA test. In order to achieve the aim, the electronic health records of 1030 patients were analyzed to find new IMID diagnoses using a text mining algorithm. These patients were retrieved from a study conducted in 2014 (Otten et al.). In their study, the researchers aimed to evaluate the current strategy concerning ANA tests for the purpose of confirming IMID diagnoses. Based on their data, the predictive value of the ANA test results for future IMID development was explored. The findings of the current study demonstrate only a small proportion of the patients that were considered to be at high risk of future IMID development actually developed an IMID in the six years following the initial ANA tests. Nevertheless, the patients that developed an IMID in the years after the ANA tests were conducted were more likely to have positive ANA screening tests and positive specific ANA tests compared to patients with similar pretest probability for IMID development that did not develop an IMID. Hence, the findings suggest ANA tests could be used as predictors for IMID development in the near future. Especially in patients that have a high pretest probability of developing a future IMID based on clinical guidance,  positive ANA test results could serve as a diagnostic tool."
Van typemachine naar telefoon: Waarom sommige Nederlandstalige schrijvers het gebruik van online schrijfplatforms boven traditionele manieren van uitgeven verkiezen,"['Christen, Amber']","['Sonnenschein, Johan']",2022-06-24T00:00:46Z,NL,['schrijfplatform; schrijven; publiceren; digitalisering; uitgeverij; sociabiliteit; gemeenschapsvorming; Wattpad; Sweek; Schrijverspunt'],Neerlandistiek,"Onder invloed van de toenemende digitalisering vinden er allerlei ontwikkelingen plaats, zo ook op het gebied van literatuur. Er wordt bijvoorbeeld steeds meer online gelezen en geschreven en met de opkomst van online schrijfplatforms is er een nieuwe manier van publiceren bij gekomen. Deze masterscriptie heeft gekeken naar dit laatste fenomeen en onderzocht waarom sommige Nederlandstalige schrijvers het gebruik van online schrijfplatforms boven traditionele manieren van uitgeven verkiezen. De verwachting rondom deze vraag was tweeledig: De eerste hypothese stelde dat er waarschijnlijk verschillen bestaan tussen schrijvers en hun motivaties van verschillende schrijfplatforms. De tweede hypothese stelde dat de toegankelijkheid en het gemeenschappelijke aspect van de platforms het belangrijkst zijn voor de populariteit die de platforms genieten. Om de hypothesen te kunnen testen, is eerst gekeken naar de kenmerken van online schrijfplatforms op basis van drie casussen (Wattpad, Sweek en Schrijverspunt) en vervolgens naar de overeenkomsten en verschillen met (semi-) traditionele manieren van publiceren. Daarna zijn de gebruikers van de drie schrijfplatforms die als casus dienden ondervraagd middels een enquête.
Uit de enquêteresultaten bleek een aantal zaken. Allereerst waren de populairste functies van de schrijfplatforms het posten van eigen teksten, het plaatsen van berichten en het hebben van interactie met medegebruikers (veelal over feedback), en in iets mindere mate het deelnemen aan (externe) schrijfwedstrijden. Dit zijn allemaal functies die niet of beperkt gefaciliteerd worden bij traditionele publicatiewijzen. De redenen om in het algemeen actief te zijn op de platforms sloten hierbij aan en aanvullend werd ook nog de toegankelijkheid van de platforms genoemd. Ten tweede had ongeveer de helft van de respondenten nooit buiten schrijfplatforms gepubliceerd en gaven ze hiervoor een aantal redenen die ze eveneens afzetten tegen traditionele publicatiewijzen: toegankelijkheid, gebruik van de platforms als leerschool, hobbymatigheid, onvoldoende kwaliteit van eigen teksten en de aanwezigheid van fijne gemeenschappen op de schrijfplatforms.
Wanneer deze inzichten samengenomen worden, ontstaat een beeld dat overeenkomt met de tweede hypothese van dit onderzoek en daarmee de hoofdvraag beantwoordt: de toegankelijkheid en het gemeenschappelijke aspect van schrijfplatforms zijn zeer belangrijke redenen waarom schrijvers voor schrijfplatforms kiezen en niet voor traditionele publicatiewijzen. De eerste hypothese kon echter niet getest worden door de ongelijke verdeling van respondenten over de casussen. Idealiter zou dit onderzoek in de toekomst op grotere schaal uitgevoerd kunnen worden, om een meer representatieve en gelijker verdeelde groep respondenten te bereiken, waar betrouwbaardere resultaten uit voortkomen."
Identifying the proteins constitutes in the necrosome complex in programmed cell death throughout necroptosis.,"['Kalaitsidou, Elisavet']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-06-24T00:00:34Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"Over recent years, immunotherapy has become an advanced and promising treatment against numerous types of cancers. However, as with any other innovative treatment, it shows noticeable challenges and complications. A combinatory therapy with the agents that induce necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, can improve the effectiveness and broaden the spectrum of application of immunotherapies. This study aims to give an overview of the necrosome complex, which occurs during the process of necroptosis. A better understanding of the necrosome complex assemble, and its constituents may possibly reveal new therapeutical targets and benefit the efficiency of immunotherapy. To investigate the components of the necrosome complex, we used several cancer cell lines that potentially can undergo necroptosis. These cell lines were exposed to necroptotic treatment to form the necrosome complex. Further, the complex was isolated through co-immunoprecipitation, targeting a RIPK3 protein with an essential role in necroptosis. Lastly, we analysed isolated complex in a mass spectrometry-based set-up to identify present proteins"
User Agency in Platform Governance: Critical Discourse Analysis of Twitter User Agreement,"['Parve, Gerli']","['Alinejad, Donya']",2022-06-24T00:00:39Z,EN,"['platform governance, social media, Twitter User Agreement, user empowerment']",New Media and Digital Culture,"Platform governance is shaping the public discourse happening on social media platforms. Therefore, it is necessary to rethink platform governance by taking a critical look at the documents it is expressed through. There is a gap in such previous research that focuses on a specific platform and analyses critically the discourse within its governance document and this thesis aims to fill it. Social media platforms are privately owned public spaces where different actors have a key role in governing them. However, the governance by different actors has brought about a contestation among the power they hold and the extent of each of their agencies. 
More specifically, this thesis will look into Twitter and the power within its governance document, Twitter User Agreement, to learn how much agency is given to the user of the platform in governing the public conversation on Twitter. By looking at the platform governance of social media platforms as it is explained by Tarleton Gillespie throughout his work and using the co-governance lens offered by Robert Gorwa in 2019, this thesis adds new insight to the existing research on platform governance. Researchers have pointed to the shortcomings of the governance methods employed by platforms for many years by now and call for moving towards a more distributed responsibility and power amongst key actors are not new among experts on the topic. However, this thesis aims to contribute to the discussion on platform governance by looking at one of the most popular social media platforms to see whether any steps towards sharing the power of governing the platform with its users are evident in their actions. The choice of material to research for this thesis, therefore, came from the idea that a platform’s governance documents seem to be the most obvious place where such intentions should be expressed. 
For the aim of this research, critical discourse analysis was conducted. By taking a look at both the content of the User Agreement as well as its context — how a user is first introduced to it and where the document leads the reader through actions it encourages and affords — this research reveals just how little a user is empowered to do in governing the platform itself and the public discourse it hosts. While the document expresses attempts to share responsibility and provide users with knowledge about how moderation works on the platform, it lacks any encouragement for the users to take action as well. The document does not exhibit to drive acts of moderation or governance on the part of the user in the same way as the platform promises to moderate content on its own. Thus, this thesis concludes that co-governance is yet to be reached by Twitter through their User Agreement, as Twitter governs the conversation they host without inviting the user to join in the conversation over how exactly this is, should and could be done."
Intolerance of Uncertainty and Body Dissatisfaction: Does Interoception Play a Role?,"[""O'Mahony, Karen""]","['Bijsterbosch, Jojanneke']",2022-06-21T23:00:46Z,EN,['Body dissatisfaction; intolerance of uncertainty; interoception; interoceptive awareness'],Clinical Psychology,"Body dissatisfaction (BD) is a well-established risk factor for the development of an eating disorder. As multitudes of eating disorder diagnoses remain each year, an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of such is of utmost importance. Both interoception, as well as an intolerance of uncertainty (IU) have independently provided utility in the study of eating disorders, however little research has examined their relationships with BD. This study therefore investigated the relationship between the separate components of IU – prospective and inhibitory – on BD, and employed interoceptive awareness (IAw) as a mediating variable. 78 females aged 18 to 29 participated via completion of measures online. Results indicated that both prospective and inhibitory IU significantly predicted BD. Prospective IU yielded a significant effect on IAw, and IAw significantly mediated the prospective IU-BD relationship. Inhibitory IU however, did not significantly predict IAw, and as such, a mediating effect of IAw within the inhibitory IU-BD relationship was not present. The more specific use of inhibitory IU is therefore suggested in lieu of a combined prospective and inhibitory IU score when discussing BD and its interventions due to it’s independently significant effects on BD. Importantly, as IAw emerged as a significant predictor within both models, it may be recommended that BD intervention be assisted via targetting interoception. While these results are based off BD data, they therefore also bear relevance to eating disorder science, and future research may benefit from examining the utility of inhibitory IU and IAw in eating disorder intervention."
The Effect of Burn Characteristics and Demographic Factors on Sexuality and Body Image,"['Rhein, Franziska']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-06-21T23:00:41Z,EN,"['burns, sexual (dis)satisfaction, body image, TBSA%, gender differences']",Clinical Psychology,"Past research has shown that burn injuries can compromise patient’s body image, which may also affect their feelings of sexual attractiveness. Yet, the evidence for sexual problems in burn survivors is rather limited, and health care professionals often lack experience in treating such issues. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate body image and sexuality in a population with burns to help improve health care services for patients. A cross-sectional design was used to examine the effect of body image on sexuality and whether gender, burn size (TBSA%) and age predict sexual and body image (dis)satisfactions. Additionally, moderation effects of gender on burn size and body image, or sexuality were also investigated. The sample included N = 117 burn survivors from multiple burn centers in Belgium and the Netherlands, who were questioned six months after their injury. Results showed significant effects for gender on body image and sexuality, with women experiencing more dissatisfactions than men. Increasing age at injury and body image dissatisfaction both predicted decreases in sexuality. Moreover, greater TBSA% was associated with declines in body image, but not in sexual satisfaction. Lastly, no moderation effect for gender on TBSA% and sexuality or body image was found. These results provide evidence for significant deteriorations in patient’s satisfaction with body image and sexuality and thereby highlight the need for health care professionals to screen for and address sexuality and body image issues with their patients with burns."
De transitie naar een brede representatie: Een onderzoek naar de representatie van transgender mensen in de Europese reality-programma’s Hij is een Zij en M/V/X,"['Hogewerf, Sil']","['Copier, Laura']",2022-06-24T00:00:44Z,NL,['Representatie; Transgender; Televisie; trans scripts; reality-televisie; tropes'],Film- en Televisiewetenschap,"In dit onderzoek is onderzocht hoe trans mensen worden gerepresenteerd in Europese reality- televisie. Om dit te onderzoeken is er een close-reading uitgevoerd van het Nederlandse programma Hij is een Zij en het Vlaamse programma M/V/X. Tijdens de analyse is er gekeken welke verhalen er verteld worden door de deelnemers van de programma’s en door hun omgeving. Hierbij is gebruik gemaakt van zes dominante scripts welke ontwikkeld zijn door Mariecke van den Berg en Mir Marinus en twee tropes welke ontwikkeld zijn door Austin H. Johnson.
De dominante scripts en tropes representeren niet alle soorten trans mensen, maar slechts een beperkte groep. Uit dit onderzoek kwam naar voren dat Hij is een Zij en M/V/X de representatie verbreden ten opzichte van de dominante scripts en tropes, maar dat ze de representatie slechts beperkt verbreden. De programma’s dragen hierdoor beiden alsnog bij aan het beeld dat trans zijn bepaald wordt door het ondergaan van een medische transitie.
Daarnaast is er een vergelijking gemaakt tussen de twee programma’s. Hierbij is er gekeken naar welke verhalen er verteld worden en naar de wijze waarop dit gebeurt. De vorm van de programma’s en de mogelijke invloed van lokale contexten zijn hierbij meegenomen. Hieruit bleek dat de programma’s in vorm van elkaar verschillen, maar dat er overlap is in de vertelde verhalen. Ondanks deze overlap bleek echter ook dat lokale contexten een rol spelen in de representatie van trans mensen. Dit laat zien dat er weliswaar dominante verhalen zijn in de representatie van trans mensen welke in meerdere landen worden gevolgd, maar dat lokale contexten alsnog zorgen voor lokale verschillen in representatie."
"The Influence of Mindfulness on Covid-19-Related
Psychological Distress","['Esslinger, Philipp']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-06-21T23:00:38Z,EN,[],Clinical Psychology,"Due to the high risks associated with the Covid-19 virus, several measures all over the
globe were put in place to keep the pandemic in check (e.g., lockdowns). These measures
seem to increase people’s stress levels (Lemenager et al., 2020; Serafini et al., 2020). One
way to cope with stress is through traits like mindfulness (Jasbi et al., 2018; Grossman et al.,
2004). Individuals with higher levels of mindfulness could experience less stress in response
to Covid-19 by helping to disengage from rumination and negative emotions. Hence, the
current study investigated if exposure to Covid-19-related news influences Covid-19-related
distress and if a brief mindfulness intervention moderates this effect. Data was collected via a
self-report survey experiment on trait mindfulness and stress resilience in 140 participants on
Amazon mTurk. The participants received either a three-minute mindfulness intervention or
an excerpt from an audiobook. Afterward, they were exposed to either a Covid-19-related or a
non-Covid-related distressing news clip. Finally, attention and manipulation checks were
given to the participants, and Covid-19-related distress was assessed. No support was found
that there would be an increase in Covid-19-related distress after exposure to Covid-19 news,
nor support for moderating effects of a brief mindfulness intervention. However, analysis of
stress resilience and the control variables provided exciting insight and possibilities for future
research."

Identification and evaluation of cell type-specific markers for human adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN),"['Corraini, Daniele']","['Hol, Elly']",2022-06-25T00:00:32Z,EN,['AHN | neurogenesis | dentate gyrus | scRNA seq | RenCells | iPSCs | ID4 | human | fetal brain'],Biology of Disease,"In human brain, most neurons are generated during fetal development, however adult neurogenesis, the lifelong self-renewal of neural stem cells (NSCs) and their maturation into neurons, remains a long-debated topic (Spalding et al., 2013; Kempermann, 2015; Boldrini et al., 2018; Sorrells et al., 2018). In rodents, two neurogenic niches are so far robustly identified, the subventricular zone (SVZ), along the walls of the lateral ventricles, and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyri in the hippocampus (Gage et al., 2000; Gillotin et al., 2021). However, the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus is the only putatively neurogenic region in the adult human brain. This process is referred to as adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). So far, to address the controversial topic of adult neurogenesis in the human hippocampus, several techniques have been used, such as neuronal birth-dating, marker-based immunohistochemistry and more recently single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (scRNA seq). Even if similar techniques have been employed, different results and conclusions have been reached, pointing towards the challenges and the limitations of the approaches and markers used to investigate this controversial topic in neuroscience. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to find new and more reliable and specific markers to investigate the presence or the absence of neurogenesis in the adult human brain. The present study aims to address this necessity by focusing on the closest established and characterized neurogenic event to the adult neurogenesis in human, namely the human fetal neurogenesis, which occurs during embryonic development. With this rational, a meta-analysis was performed taking into consideration studies where human fetal brain samples were subjected to scRNA sequencing. The hypothesis behind this study is that neurogenic cell type-specific markers might be conserved between fetal and adult neurogenesis in human (Urbán and Guillemot, 2014). Hence, a list of candidate markers for NSCs, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and immature neurons (ImNs) was obtained via in silico cross-referencing of previously published single-cell transcriptomic datasets. Subsequently, these candidate markers were further evaluated by analysing their transcriptional profile along the differentiation of two distinct human stem cell lines, induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and RenCells, selecting those with an expected expression profile for each specific cell type of interest. In addition, the expression of the selected candidate markers, one for each cell type, was validated via immunofluorescence in the same two human stem cell lines. The final candidate markers were also tested in mouse brain section at two different aging stages, in healthy and Alzheimer’s mouse model brain. Based on our preliminary results, the selected gene sets may offer a useful resource for identifying neurogenic markers conserved in fetal and adult human brain. Yet, further evaluation and validation follow-up studies are necessary, in order to systematically delineate commonalities and differences between embryonic and adult neurogenesis on a quest for more specific neurogenic markers."
Metataxonomics and metagenomics in IBD research: A literature review,"['Melissen, Martijn']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-06-27T23:00:40Z,EN,['metagenomics; metataxonomics; IBD'],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"Inflammatoire darmziekten, ook wel als IBD aangeduid, is een groep chronische ontstekingsziekten van het maag-darmstelsel. De twee belangrijkste vormen van IBD zijn colitis ulcerosa en de ziekte van Crohn en wereldwijd worden er miljoenen mensen aangetast door deze ziektes. De echte primaire oorzaken van IBD zijn nog onbekend en er wordt hier veel onderzoek naar gedaan. Het lastige aan het onderzoek naar IBD ligt hem in de veelzijdigheid en interconnectiviteit in de pathologie van IBD. Er zijn namelijk een enorme hoeveelheid factoren die mogelijk gerelateerd zijn met het begin en verloop van inflammatoire darmziekten en veel van die factoren beïnvloeden elkaar weer. Daarnaast is het onbekend of deze factoren oorzaak of juist gevolg zijn. Hierbij gaat het om omgevingsfactoren zoals dieet, stress, levensstijl (roken), slaappatronen en (darm)infecties maar ook om genetische factoren. De ontstekingsreacties die de ziektes typeren komen door het aanvallen van eigen afweercellen, en een sterk geactiveerd immuunsysteem is dan ook een kenmerk van chronische darmontstekingen. Waarschijnlijk speelt de darmflora, ook wel darm-microbioom genoemd, een grote rol hierin, dit is de totaliteit aan micro-organismen die zich in het maag-darmstelsel bevinden. Een afwijking van soortenrijkdom van de darmflora (dysbiose) is karakteristiek voor IBD-patiënten en correleert dus ook sterk met de ziekte.
In het onderzoek naar IBD en de mogelijke relatie met de darmflora zijn er de afgelopen decennia veel ontwikkelingen geweest. Door vooruitgangen in technologie zoals moderne DNA-sequencing technologieën is het mogelijk geworden om op andere, diepgaandere manieren de samenstelling van de darmflora te bepalen. Wetenschappelijke velden die veel toegepast worden zijn de zogenaamde omics-methoden. De meest gebruikte hiervan zijn metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metataxonomics en metabolomics, waarbij respectievelijk gekeken wordt naar de aanwezige bacteriële genen en genomen en RNA  van de darmflora, naar de taxonomie van de soorten bacteriën en naar de bacteriële stofwisselingsproducten (metabolieten) welke in de feces of fecale wateren voorkomen. Het is van belang om kritisch te kijken naar hoe de ontwikkelingen binnen deze velden verlopen en om te bedenken welke methodes hierbinnen het meest veelbelovend zijn. Dit verslag zal kijken naar een aantal van de omics velden en de methodes die ze bevatten in een historisch perspectief plaatsen. Deze methodes zullen afgewogen worden op basis van hun voor- en nadelen en er zal gekeken worden naar de richting die het IBD-onderzoek opgaat. Uiteindelijk zullen er aanbevelingen gegeven worden en wordt er gereflecteerd over of er nog aspecten missen in het hedendaagse onderzoek naar inflammatoire darmziekten."

We provide evidence for the exploitation of fish, shellfish, wheat and barley by the Norse population. We also identified the causative agent of plague Yersinia pestis from middens, which has not been found before in Greenland. Furthermore, we show that genome assembly of these environmental samples can be improved by using a combination of long- and short-read sequencing data."

for ex vivo heart function","['Ginneken, Ilona van']","['Mokry, Michal']",2022-07-01T00:00:58Z,EN,['Ex vivo hartperfusie; celvrij DNA; celvrij RNA'],Biology of Disease,"Hart- en vaatziekten zijn wereldwijd doodsoorzaak nummer één en resulteren vaak in hartfalen, 
waarbij verminderde toevoer van zuurstof naar organen optreedt. Voor patiënten met 
eindstadium hartfalen blijft harttransplantatie de beste behandeling voor lange-termijn overleving 
met goede levenskwaliteit. Helaas zijn er meer patiënten die een harttransplantatie nodig 
hebben, dan beschikbare donorharten. Momenteel worden donorharten op ijs bewaard tot de 
transplantatie. Deze donorharten moeten binnen vier uur na overlijden getransplanteerd worden, 
omdat het complicatierisico daarna groot is door ondervonden schade. Om de bewaartijd van 
donorharten met behoud van hartfunctie te verlengen worden nieuwe bewaringstechnieken 
ontwikkeld.
In dit onderzoek werden varkensharten vier uur bewaard op ijs of in een machine met een 
daarvoor ontwikkelde vloeistof die door het hart werd gepompt. Koude doorstroming van het hart 
zorgt, net zoals bewaring op ijs, voor verlaagde energiebehoeften van het hart, maar vermindert 
ook ophoping van schadelijke stoffen. Deze bewaarmethode staat het toe om hartfunctie indirect 
te beoordelen via stoffen vrijgekomen in de doorstroomvloeistof. Lactaat is de belangrijkste 
bepalende factor tijdens machine perfusie voor het kiezen van te gebruiken harten voor 
transplantatie, omdat dit in eerder onderzoek voorspellend is gebleken voor harttransplantatieuitkomsten. De betrouwbaarheid van lactaat als indicator voor harttransplantatie-uitkomsten 
wordt nog in twijfel getrokken, dus het is belangrijk dat nieuwe indicatoren worden onderzocht. 
In dit onderzoek hebben we bestudeerd of cel-vrij DNA en RNA (cf-DNA en cf-RNA), welke 
voorkomen in de doorstroomvloeistof, gebruikt kunnen worden voor het voorspellen van 
hartfunctie. Na koude bewaring werden de harten vier uur lang gekoppeld aan een warme 
perfusiemachine voor hart reperfusie. Hiermee werd de situatie na transplantatie nagebootst en 
was functionele beoordeling mogelijk. Tijdens koude en warme perfusie werden niveaus van 
zowel cf-DNA en cf-RNA als andere markers voor hartschade en ontsteking gemeten. 
Cf-DNA is hoogstwaarschijnlijk afkomstig van stervende cellen. We hebben gekeken cf-DNAniveaus afkomstig uit celkernen of mitochondriën. Dit zijn respectievelijk markers voor algemene 
cellulaire en mitochondriële schade. Cf-RNA, daarentegen, wordt voornamelijk door levende 
cellen vrijgelaten. Hierdoor wordt gedacht dat cf-RNA-niveaus de genexpressieprofielen van de 
cellen die het uitscheiden weerspiegelen. Hiermee kunnen we voorspellen welke cellen het RNA 
uitscheiden en of die cellen beschadigd zijn. Het onderzoek toonde aan dat totale en 
mitochondriële cf-DNA niveaus afnamen tijdens koude perfusie en toenamen tijdens warme 
perfusie, terwijl de nucleaire niveaus redelijk gelijk bleven. We zagen positieve correlatietrends 
van mitochondriële cf-DNA levels tijdens koude perfusie met lactaat levels tijdens warme 
perfusie. Ook zagen we negatieve correlatietrends tussen warme perfusie cf-DNA levels en 
linker atrium druk, wat een maat is voor de voorbelasting van het hart. Het gebrek aan sterke 
correlaties is verklaarbaar door het minimale verschil van functionele waardes tussen harten van 
verschillende kwaliteit. We zagen dat hartspiercellen de voornaamste bron waren van cf-RNA en 
dat biologische processen betrokken in energieproductie en metabolisme verslechterden tijdens 
zowel koude als warme perfusie. Genregulatie processen en immuunreacties werden opgewerkt 
tijdens koude en warme perfusie, respectievelijk. 
Ons onderzoek indiceert dat cf-DNA- en/of cf-RNA levels mogelijk voorspellend zijn voor 
hartfunctie. Wellicht kunnen therapieën die mitochondriële schade beperken, het 
energiemetabolisme behouden, en/of een immuunreactie voorkomen, een mogelijke uitkomst 
bieden om donorharten langer te kunnen bewaren met hart machine perfusie."

There is sadly a major problem with the widespread (over)use of these drugs: cases of multi-drug resistant bacteria, especially Gram-negative bacteria are becoming more prevalent. These Gram-negative superbugs have an additional impregnable membrane that greatly increases their resistance towards their environment and antimicrobial compounds. We will need novel antibiotics to combat these pathogens, however only very few novel antibiotics have been approved for clinical use in the last decades. Murepavadin is a β-hairpin peptidomimetic antibiotic that is active against ESKAPE pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). Pa is a major cause of death in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that leads to abnormally viscous mucus in the lungs. This altered environment is perfect for opportunistic bacterial infections, which develops into a chronic infection as the Pa is impossible to get rid of without the use of antibiotics. Murepavadin targets the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) transport protein LptD that is essential in Pa and many more Gram-negative bacteria. Inhibition of the LptD prevents LPS insertion into the outer membrane and will lead to cell death. Thus far, there is no structural information on Murepavadin’s mode of action and interaction with Pa LptD available. Here, we propose an approach for elucidating Murepavadin’s interaction with Pa LptD at high-resolution and in physiologically relevant conditions using solid-state NMR. This project will provide not only novel insight about Murepavadin and LptD, but will also provide a basis for improvement of existing and development of novel antibiotics targeting the essential OMP LptD."
Predicting Short- and Long-Term Neurodevelopmental Outcome Based on Term-Equivalent Age MRI in Extremely Preterm Infants,"['Aalbers, Vera']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-07-01T00:00:44Z,EN,['Neonatal brain injury; MRI; extreme prematurity; neurodevelopmental outcome; cognition; motor; behaviour'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Objectives
Extremely preterm infants (born <28 weeks of gestation) are at high risk for brain abnormalities as a complication of preterm birth, which can lead to impaired neurodevelopmental outcome. Better prediction early in life may steer targeted interventions and improve outcome. Therefore, this study aims to relate brain abnormalities seen on term-equivalent age (TEA) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to neurodevelopmental outcome at two and five years of age in a large cohort of extremely preterm infants and to determine risk factors associated with outcome. 

Study design
Brain abnormalities and maturation of the white matter, cortical and deep grey matter, and cerebellum were scored on TEA-MRI in 352 infants born before 28 weeks of gestation, using the Kidokoro scoring system. Cognitive, motor, and behavioural outcome was assessed at two and five years of age using standardised tests (Bayley-III-NL, WPPSI-III-NL, MABC-2-NL, and CBCL). Associations between TEA-MRI and outcome were determined using univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses.

Results
Cognitive and motor outcome at two and five years could be well predicted by the global brain abnormality score, even after adjusting for perinatal variables and maternal education (B = -.808, p = .005, B = -.704, p = .007, B = -1.299, p = <.001, B = -.207, p = .003, respectively). However, the prognostic value of TEA-MRI related to behavioural outcome was limited. At two years of corrected age, numerous perinatal variables which contributed to outcome were determined, while these played a less important role at five years of age. Maternal education contributed to multiple outcome measures at both ages. 

Conclusion
The prognostic value of TEA-MRI related to cognitive and motor outcome at two and five years of age is promising. However, TEA-MRI was limited in predicting behavioural outcome for both ages.

Guidelines regarding care for CUP patients are limitedly available, particularly for those who present with (synchronous) single or multiple brain metastases (BM-CUP). Knowledge on the incidence, approach and survival is scarce but is urgently needed to reveal current challenges and points for improvement in care for patients with BM-CUP.
Methods: We performed a literature search on CUP patients and brain metastases in PubMed using the terms “CUP” OR “primary unknown tumour” AND “brain metastases”, focusing on reports published between 2017 and 2021. Variables considered were age, gender, presence and localisation of brain metastases, and prognosis. Also, information from the Dutch National Cancer Registry (NCR) was collected to review current practices in The Netherlands. 
Results: Ten international publications were identified on BM-CUP via the literature search, indicating a shortage of research on this subject. From the NCR, clinical metadata could be retrieved for a total of 1,419 BM-CUP patients. An increase in the proportion of BM-CUP patients from 8.1% to 10.1% was observed between 2009 and 2018. Incidence was slightly higher in men (54%). Cancer histology was not determined in most cases (42.7%). Presentation with multiple brain lesions was slightly more prevalent (52.9%). Among cases with known localization, most lesions were located in supratentorial areas (24.7%). Statistically significant associations were found for gender, age, and tumour histology in relation to BM-CUP incidence, and for age, histology, and tumour localisation in relation to survival (p <0.01).
Discussion: Our search showed how little literature is currently available on BM-CUP. Our analyses of BM-CUP in The Netherlands showed significant associations in relation to incidence and survival. This research aims to contribute to better knowledge on the current challenges in the care for patients with BM-CUP. This should aid improvement of the diagnostic approach, clinical decision making, and quality of life for patients with BM from CUP."
Understanding the Effects of Water and Energy Crises on Small-Scale Urban Food Systems’ Resilience in Cape Town,"['Waldenberger, Johanna']","['Smith, Shaun']",2022-07-01T00:00:40Z,EN,['food system resilience; water-energy-food nexus; Cape Town; food security;\ntransformation; innovation.'],Urban and Economic Geography,"This research examines the impacts of recent water and energy crises on small-scale food systems’ 
resilience in Cape Town, South Africa. Small-scale food system activities are argued to be highly
vulnerable to disturbances. However, there is limited research on how the sector is affected by 
interrelated water and energy crises, how resilient the diverse food systems activities are in response 
to such crises, and how crises can induce ‘transformative’ change across sectors. Through in-depth 
interviews with small-scale food actors in Cape Town, this research finds that underlying social 
vulnerabilities exacerbate vulnerabilities to water and energy crises and hinder the implementation 
of resilience strategies. The research also finds that the small-scale sector inhibits moderate 
transformative capacities in the form of innovations in farming practices. However, financial and 
institutional barriers hinder the successful implementation of more technological innovations. In order 
to increase small-scale food system resilience to water and energy crises, this research suggests that
water, energy and food resources should be coordinated by local authorities, who can pay better 
attention to place-based attributes. Moreover, providing access to non-networked water and energy 
sources to small-scale actors is seen as a solution to current vulnerabilities. The research furthermore 
suggests that new conceptualisations of resilience would benefit from including nexus thinking to 
minimise trade-offs of sectoral resilience strategies."

Forms play an integral part in the arrangement of our reality, whatever the true nature of that reality may be. These forms, whether sensory or conceptual in nature, make up the multiplicity and diversity of objects we interact with and experience in the world around us. In the introduction to The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, philosopher Ernst Cassirer writes that “it would seem as though we could apprehend reality only in the particularity of these forms, whence it follows that in these forms reality is cloaked as well as revealed.”1 His introduction presents forms as something more than a sensory experience, and rather as an epistemological link between our inner consciousness and external reality.
Any creative or intellectual human pursuit, be it science, art, language, or religion, carries in its essence an examination and expression of form. We intuitively experienced the rolling of a ball and the building properties of a block as young children before we could physically name these objects. Geometry itself is fundamentally infused into our developmental stages as individuals and in the historical development of our human communication as a species.2 This perspective calls for an examination of the role of forms in the creation of knowledge and, particularly, in the creation of scientific knowledge as a creative pursuit. An initial general question for such a quest would be: What is the epistemological role of form in the creation of scientific knowledge? In other words, how do forms help us know?"

The Power to Bite Back: How a lack of FDI’s can lead to populism in places that don’t matter,"['Beijaard, Erik']","['Cortinovis, Nicola']",2022-07-19T00:00:37Z,EN,"[""FDI's; economic competitiveness; regional economics; spatial econometrics; populism; places that don't matter; geographies of discontent""]",Human Geography,"Over the previous 50 years, economic geographers have observed some key changes in the
world. As globalisation has shaped our world, we now look at it from a more regional
perspective. We pay much attention to the regions that have succeeded, such as Silicon
Valley, but we also look at the regions that have fallen behind. We now often view the future
of peripheral regions in the first world as less hopeful than central regions in the third world
(Rodriguez-Pose, 2018). As many revitalisation projects have failed to make peripheral
regions catch up, policymakers believe it is the best strategy to put all eggs in one basket and
only focus on the biggest cities in the country. As a result, underperforming cities and
peripheral regions are left out of the development scope. These underrepresented regions
are ‘the places that don’t matter’ (Rodriguez-Pose, 2018). Populist parties are often popular
in these areas because they make the unrepresented feel heard (Rodriguez-Pose, 2020). As a
result, the support for populist parties has doubled in Europe over the last 20 years (Henley,
2020).

Through a literary study, we’ve established that Dunning’s (2008) OLI paradigm can help us
understand MNE’s FDI location choices. Ownership-, location- and internalization
advantages all play a role in determining if and where to invest. Important variables that play
a role are: formal and informal institutional quality, human capital, infrastructure, stability
and culture. In its turn, FDI’s can affect inequality and inequality can affect populism.
To test whether FDI’s also have a direct effect on populism, this researched proposed to
conduct spatial regression analysis in R. The research consisted of the entire European
Union, without former member the United Kingdom and without overseas territories on a
NUTS 3 scale level. FDI data was collected over a longer time period, namely 2003 till 2015.
All other variables were captured from 2015 till 2019 at the latest to see the effects of FDI’s.
To create the dataset, many different sources were used such as ESPON, Eurostat, the EQI
Index and the OECD database. Finally, to obtain voting data, the CLEA dataset as well as
many different internal affairs datasets were used.
The dataset consisted of 1157 regions and more than 20 variables. Although for some
variables not all regions were included, most variables still proved to be representative for
the total research population as the data was randomly collected and the sample size
allowed us to generalize with a 95% confidence interval. For some variables however, it
should be noted that the findings can’t be generalized to certain counties.

After analysing the dataset, we found that FDI’s increase both interregional- as intraregional
inequality. On its turn, these types of inequalities mostly significantly affected the four
different types of populism, although some relationships were positively related and others
were negatively related. As a result, no direct relationship between FDI’s and populism could
be established. Furthermore, there was no negative feedback loop detected between FDI’s
and populism. Some noteworthy relationships with populism that were found were the
positive relationship with unemployment and voting populist, Eurosceptic and far-left and
the positive relationship with high education levels and voting far-right, but negative
relationship with voting far-left."
FC Utrecht: (on)professioneel?,"['Hermsen, Bradley']","['Roest, Jan-Willem van der']",2022-07-19T00:00:40Z,NL,['FC UTRECHT HRM BVO FOOTBALL CLUB BACK OFFICE PROFESSIONAL SPORT ORGANISATION HRM IN SPORTS'],Sportbeleid en sportmanagement,"In de Nederlandse context is met name het betaald voetbal immens populair onder de bevolking. Elke dag worden er nieuwe onderzoeken gedaan waar atleten, coaches en suppporters centraal staan. Echter wordt vaak de groep van mensen vergeten in het betaald voetbal die indirect een grote impact hebben op het functioneren van clubs en verenigingen. Namelijk de bureaumedewerker.

Volgens onderzoek identificeren werknemers in de sportsector zich meer met hun werkgever, zijn meer trots en ervaren een hogere passie binnen hun werkcontext in tegenstelling tot de meeste werknemers in een traditionele omgeving. Tegelijkertijd concluderen recente onderzoeken dat burn-out en stress steeds vaker voorkomen in de sportwereld onder werknemers. Is het een mogelijkheid dat de hoge identificatie, trots en passie enerzijds maakt dat werknemers in sportorganisaties worden gemotiveerd echter anderzijds een vermoeiende of stresserende werking op medewerkers in sportorganisaties heeft?

Het doel van het betreffende onderzoek is om erachter te komen welke betekenis bureaumedewerkers van FC Utrecht geven aan identificatie, trots en passie, en in welke mate deze waarden worden ervaren als motiverend en/of stresserend. Op basis van drie deelvragen, welke zijn beantwoord door middel van een literatuurstudie en interviews met 20 bureaumedewerkers van FC Utrecht is een antwoord geformuleerd op de onderzoeksvraag. Om de betekenis van respondenten in kaart te brengen is het JD-R model toegepast dat wordt gebruikt om onderzoek te doen naar werkmotivatie en werknemerswelzijn. Door het JD-R model te gebruiken als theoretische lens werd geanalyseerd wat respondenten ervaarden als motiverend en/of stresserend in hun werk.

Uit het onderzoek werd vastgesteld dat waarden als identificatie, trots en passie herkenbare concepten zijn voor bureaumedewerkers van FC Utrecht. Zo geven respondenten aan zich erg verbonden te voelen met de identiteit van FC Utrecht. Ook geven respondenten aan een trots gevoel te hebben bij hun werkplek en is passie niet onbekend. Hoewel respondenten deze waarden met name ervaren als motiverend is er een vermoeiende en stresserende invloed. Zo werd in de interviews vastgesteld dat deze vormen van psychologische voldoening een valkuil kunnen zijn voor zowel FC Utrecht als organisatie als voor werknemers binnen deze organisatie. De hoge betrokkenheid van bureaumedewerkers voor wat zich afspeelt binnen FC Utrecht is enerzijds een kracht en anderzijds een zwakte in de vorm van blijven doorwerken, weinig tijd voor reflectie, fixatie op korte termijn en weinig ruimte voor de diepere ik. Respondenten geven aan een behoefte te hebben aan een professionaliseringsslag en FC Utrecht méér te runnen als bedrijf met kenmerken als capaciteit, structuur en lange termijn beleid. Anderzijds werd in dit onderzoek ondervonden dat respondenten elke dag worden gemotiveerd door de leuke hectiek, impact van emoties en de affiniteit voor sport, voetbal en FC Utrecht.

Concluderend werd in dit onderzoek vastgesteld dat met name de maatschappelijke impact van FC Utrecht sterk is gekoppeld aan de betekenis die bureaumedewerkers van FC Utrecht geven aan waarden als identificatie, trots en passie. Dit onderzoek heeft bewezen dat dé motiverende factor voor bureaumedewerkers in de context van een BVO méér dan voetbal is.

In het licht van het antwoord op de centrale onderzoeksvraag worden verschillende aanbevelingen gedaan voor FC Utrecht. De eerste aanbeveling is het professionaliseren in feedback. Hoewel de informele sfeer het gevoel van vrijheid bevordert wint het steeds van de professionele rol. Ten tweede wordt aangeraden om aan mens-gedreven prestatiemanagement te doen waarin de focus wordt gelegd op professionele interesses, ambities en specifieke carrièredoelen. Tot slot zou FC Utrecht gebruik kunnen maken van de ambidextrie-strategie om te overleven op korte en lange te"

Quantitative data were obtained from questionnaires administered to 118 children and adolescents placed out of home and residing in Dutch (extended) youth care. Qualitative data were obtained by retrospective, semi-structured interviews among ten adolescents who had previously been placed out of home. 
Results show that none of the youth experienced a stable time in youth care due to lack of future prospects, many relocations and changes within placements. A clear future perspective was not often experienced: more often the future of adolescents was unclear, mostly due to inadequate information. This lack of clarity had an impact on adolescents' mental states and behavior. Later in life, all participants had a high need for clarity and control. All adolescents were dissatisfied with their experienced amount of self-determination. Participants want social workers to invest more in them, so they feel seen and heard and more informed decisions can be made. Further research is needed on the potential protective influence of perceived stability and future prospects on the well-being and behavior of these vulnerable adolescents. This knowledge can contribute to effective prevention policies.

Lifestyle Behaviors and Inflammatory Markers in Childhood Cancer Survivors: a systematic review,"['Reumerman, Maria']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-07-19T00:00:52Z,EN,['Childhood Cancer Survivors; inflammation; lifestyle'],Biology of Disease,"Background: Survivors of childhood-, adolescent- and young adult (CAYA) cancers often face comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis earlier than expected for their age. These observed effects have previously been linked to a cancer treatment-induced pro-inflammatory state. As these late effects can greatly impact mortality and quality of life, it is important to identify factors or interventions that can delay the onset of these diseases. Previous research has shown that a poor lifestyle is a modifiable risk factor for inflammation. Consequently, healthy lifestyle choices might counteract the inflammatory processes that underly the late effects in survivors.
Aim: The aim of this systematic review was to give an overview of the evidence for the relationship between lifestyle behaviors and inflammatory markers in CAYA cancer survivors.
Methods: For this systematic review, the database PubMed was searched for articles reporting lifestyle behaviors and inflammatory markers (acute phase proteins) in CAYA cancer survivors (0-25 years at diagnosis). Lifestyle behaviors were defined as dietary intake, physical activity, vitamin D levels or intake, alcohol intake, smoking and stress (therapy). Titles and abstracts were screened by two independent reviewers and eligible studies were selected for full-text review. From all included study, we extracted data concerning study methods, characteristics of participants and outcomes along with risk of bias.

Results: In total, 722 studies were screened of which two studies were included in this review. The first study by Blair and colleagues was a randomized cross-over trial, investigating the effect of 4-week purple grape juice (pGJ) supplementation compared to 4-week clear apple juice (cAJ) supplementation on plasma inflammatory markers Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in survivors of various childhood cancers. There was no significant beneficial effect of pGJ- over cAJ supplementation on MPO (p=0.15) or hs-CRP (p=0.37) levels.
The second study by Ketterl and colleagues had an observational cross-sectional design, investigating the inflammatory markers Interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and body composition measures (percent fat mass (PFM) and total lean body mass (LBM)) in survivors of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) compared to age- and sex-matched siblings. HCT survivors had significantly higher IL-6 levels (p<0.05) and approximately 5% higher PFM (p<0.005) compared to their siblings, irrespective of previous cancer treatment. Additionally, LBM was significantly lower in HCT survivors who had received Total Body Irradiation (TBI) (p<0.001).

Discussion & Conclusion: The included studies suggested that although pGJ supplementation does not change inflammatory markers, low lean body mass or increased PFM might be associated with chronic inflammation and might therefore be a target for delaying late effects in childhood cancer survivors. In adult cancer survivors, lifestyle has already shown beneficial effects in inflammation and chronic diseases, which highlights the need for randomized trials investigating the relation between lifestyle, inflammation, and late effects in childhood cancer survivors."
Modelling mud-induced wave damping with Delft3D and SWAN-Mud,"['Loef, Bram']","['Ruessink, Gerben']",2022-07-19T00:00:59Z,EN,"['Fluid mud, Energy dissipation, Wave-damping, Dispersion relation, SWAN-Mud, Suriname']",Earth Surface and Water,"Fluid mud is suspended cohesive sediment on top of the consolidated bed. The fluid mud is generated by an external force that liquefies the bed sediment. When the water in the overlying layer is in motion, it experiences energy dissipation due to the fluid mud. A large decrease in significant wave height was observed in field experiments for beaches with fluid mud compared to beaches without this mud (Wells & Coleman, 1981). Often this fluid mud forms mudbanks in front of a shore, alternating with areas without mud, the interbank area. These mudbanks are found, for example, in front of the coast of India or on the north coast of South America. This study aims to learn more about mud-induced wave damping as a function of mud and wave characteristics. To reach this aim, various idealized model simulations were set up in which mud and wave characteristics were varied in 1D and 2D; the model was then applied to a case study on the Suriname coast. SWAN-Mud is combined with Delft3D-Wave, an application from Deltares that works around SWAN-Mud and improves the model’s usability for more extensive and complicated experiments. Different formulations for dissipation of wave energy due to fluid mud are implemented in the model SWAN-Mud, but experience with these formulations in real-life test cases is limited.

At the onset of this study, we corrected an error in the dispersion relationships embedded in SWAN-Mud. Furthermore, different bugs in the source code have been restored, which improved the model. For the DeWit method, a dissipation term had to be included in SWAN-Mud. In order to test different mud characteristics, experiments for a 1D setting (transects) were performed, based on Kranenburg (2008). A 2D experiment with an idealized mudbank was conducted for different wave heights, periods, and directions at the domain's boundaries and different wind speeds and directions. The same wave characteristics have been tested for the Suriname experiments as in the 2D experiments. These wave and wind characteristics were based on the ERA-5 model data set, representing summer, winter, and storm conditions. However, more practical scenarios have been conducted to find accurate results. For the wave environment, only one parameter, e.g., direction, was changed in these scenarios.

After updating SWAN-Mud, results for the imaginary wavenumber (which measures the rate at which wave height exponentially decreases when the wave propagates through the domain.) correspond to analytical solutions of the dispersion relationships. With the updated model, we could observe the influence of the mudbanks on the incoming waves. Mud dissipation is highest for the waves with the largest wave height. However, a minimal wave period seems necessary for dissipation to happen. Compared to the scenarios without mud, the significant wave height is much smaller when the waves reach the shore. This implies that without these mudbanks, the coast is much more exposed to wave forcing and, e.g. erosion of the coast is more severe. The mud does not only dissipate waves with larger wave periods. Measuring the wave spectra over the mudbanks revealed that the mud dissipates a fraction of high-frequency wind waves generated in the domain. However, a large part of the high-frequency waves still reaches the shore. Nevertheless, the exact morphodynamics and hydrodynamics on and around the mudbanks remain unclear. The influence of the mudbanks on the wave environment and so the coastal morphodynamics is huge. The mudbanks play an essential role in protecting the hinterland of the mudbanks and are related to areas of coastal accretion. In contrast, the interbank areas are related to coastal erosion due to the high waves reaching the shore."

Het is voor de gemeente Amsterdam van belang dat meer meiden participeren in sport, zodat ook zij kunnen profiteren van de positieve effecten die sport met zich mee brengt. Er zijn verschillende initiatieven om meer meiden in beweging te brengen. Desondanks is de sportdeelname van meiden nog erg laag. Inzicht in de redenen voor de lage sportdeelname is van belang om het sportaanbod beter aan te laten sluiten bij de behoeften van de meiden en meer meiden in beweging te brengen.

Bestaand onderzoek richt zich met name op het sportsocialisatieproces en de invloed van genderstereotypering. Het is echter onduidelijk hoe gendersocialisatie en sportsocialisatie van invloed zijn op adolescente meiden met verschillende culturele achtergronden. Daarnaast zijn er tegenstrijdige resultaten te vinden in de literatuur over de invloed van ouders en familie op de sportparticipatie van meiden. Dit onderzoek gaat hier dieper op in door middel van de volgende hoofdvraag: ‘’Op welke wijze wordt door Amsterdamse vrouwelijke adolescenten en hun ouders betekenis gegeven aan de relatie tussen gender en sport en bewegen en wat zijn daarvan de gevolgen voor hun sportparticipatie?’’. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om inzicht te krijgen in de betekenissen die meiden en hun ouders geven aan sport en bewegen, om zo het sportsocialisatieproces en de invloed daarvan op de sportdeelname inzichtelijk te krijgen.

Om antwoord te kunnen geven op de hoofdvraag zijn 6 meiden tussen de 12-18 jaar en 5 ouders geïnterviewd. Daarnaast is er een documentanalyse uitgevoerd van de beleidsbrief ‘vrouwen en sport’, om de betekenissen van de meiden en ouders te kunnen vergelijken met het huidige beleidsdiscours van de gemeente Amsterdam. Voor het analyseren van de onderzoeksresultaten zijn onderzoeken naar sportsocialisatieprocessen en de theorie van Bourdieu (1978) over sociale orde, ongelijkheid en macht gebruikt.

Uit de resultaten zijn een aantal beperkende factoren voor de sportdeelname naar voren gekomen, die deels beïnvloed worden door gender, zoals het beperkte sportaanbod in de wijk, een onveilige buurt en culturele opvattingen. Niet alleen ouders, maar meerdere familieleden blijken invloed te hebben op de sportkeuzes van de meiden. Daarnaast blijkt dat alle meiden en ouders sport en bewegen belangrijk vinden, zowel voor meiden als voor jongens. Desalniettemin is de definitie die de meiden en ouders aan sport geven anders dan hoe sport op sommige vlakken wordt gedefinieerd in het beleidsdiscours. In het beleidsdiscours wordt gefocust op de georganiseerde sport en gemengd sporten, terwijl meiden het liefst alleen met vrouwen sporten en het anders georganiseerde sportaanbod beter bij meiden past. Dit zorgt voor een kloof in de manier waarop er wordt gekeken naar het verhogen van de sportdeelname van de meiden.

Het perspectief van de meiden en ouders biedt beleidsmakers nieuwe inzichten over het bestaande sportaanbod en sportparticipatiebeleid. Deze inzichten kunnen worden gebruikt om meer meiden in beweging te brengen."

The parenting view influences parenting practices (Mowder, 2005). Parenting practices are of influence on the development of the child, and can lead to positive or negative outcomes for the development of the child (Respler-Herman et al., 2012). Little is known about the parenting view of parents in Malawi. As it is crucial to know these views of parents, this research explored the parenting view of Malawian parents. Parenting can be enhanced by interventions focusing on positive parenting (Shenderovich et al., 2019), such as the Parenting Challenge of the Dutch NGO Help a Child. Therefore, this research also focused on how this parenting intervention influenced parenting views of Malawian parents. To answer the research questions, 20 photovoice interviews were conducted and six sessions of the intervention were observed. Results showed that the Malawian parenting view mainly focuses on practical aspects such as the provision of food, school needs, and clothing for their children. Besides, the results showed that the Parenting Challenge influenced the parenting view of the parents participated. These findings contribute to the knowledge on parenting views in Malawi and possible influences of parenting interventions. Recommendations are made to Help a Child and other organisations on how to further develop and adapt a parenting intervention. Suggestions for further research are also provided."

Interactive Explanation of High-dimensional Data Projections,"['Thijssen, Julian']","['Telea, Alex']",2022-07-19T00:01:37Z,EN,"['high-dimensional, analysis, projections, explanation, interactive']",Game and Media Technology,"Companies, institutions and researchers around the world are collecting enormous sets of high-dimensional data at breakneck speed. However, our understanding of the collected data is not nearly keeping up. One of the main approaches to understanding these datasets has been to reduce the data to a low-dimensional representation, called a projection, that can subsequently be visualised.

Seeing visible patterns in these projections indicates there are relationships between the dimensions of the high-dimensional data. However, it does not tell us anything about what those relationships are.
Several efforts have previously been made to explain the patterns in the projection in terms of their original dimensions. However, they tend to fall short in adequately explaining them, or the techniques don't scale well to a higher number of dimensions. Therefore, this thesis aims to answer the question how to adequately explain these patterns in projections of high-dimensional data, while simultaneously scaling better than previous techniques in the number of data dimensions.

We extend the variance-based explanations of previous work with a value-based explanation, that gives insight into, not only why the patterns are there, but what they represent. Furthermore, we introduce a user-driven exploration mechanism that provides significantly more detailed explanations of regions in the projection. In addition, these explanations are augmented by a number of tools that support their function. We integrate all of the above elements into a visualisation solution for exploring high-dimensional data projections.

We assess the visualisation system using an evaluation study asking a mix of 23 experts and non-experts to analyze several datasets of increasing dimensionality (12, 31, 58) using the proposed solution, as well as their opinion on the usefulness of each of the elements of the visualisation solution.

Participants rated each of the elements of the visualisation system highly in terms of their usefulness. In addition, with minimal training and by overwhelming majority, participants answered correctly to a series of twelve control questions meant to test whether they understood how to read the explanations generated by the visualisation system. On a series of nine more complex analysis questions, where participants had to use the system themselves, the majority gave answers that strongly aligned with our analysis. This indicates use of the system results in consistent insights about the data with only minor training or expertise required.

Overall, the evaluation study indicates that our visualisation solution is capable of providing detailed and consistent explanations of patterns in data projections, even as the dimensionality of the data gets higher."
Dynamic preservation of Holocene meander cutoffs in laterally migrating rivers,"['Groenewege, Robert']","['Cohen, Kim']",2022-07-19T00:01:44Z,EN,[],Earth Surface and Water,"When rivers keep meandering long enough, their channel belts widen to a certain width due to lateral channel migration processes. A meandering river tends to shift and sharpen its bends as the outcome of channel migration, and at some point cut them off. This leaves a cutoff meander element (usually a point bar complex with an oxbow lake) with a certain area and in a certain lateral position. Over time, continued channel migration and new cutoffs will erode, rework, and reincorporate parts of the older abandoned meanders. While vertical preservation in a long stratigraphic section is well understood, specific understanding of the forcing mechanisms and robust quantitative metrics of migration and lateral (meander) preservation rates and temporal development still are underdeveloped. 

Here, previously proposed conceptual models of fluvial preservation were evaluated through numerical modelling. A morphodynamic, two-dimensional model (Nays2D) was used to simulate the evolution of a single-thread meandering river that is dominated by chute cutoffs. This river was analogous to the lower reach of the river Rhine in Germany but downscaled to flume dimensions. Four model scenarios were run with different mean water discharge, which produced channel patterns ranging from barely mobile enough for meandering to highly mobile, or wandering, with multiple threads. Two model runs showed extensive meander formation by a continuous single-thread river (𝑃 ≈ 1.5). 

It was observed that preservation was generally higher for extensive point bars (with scroll bars) and marginal deposits than for smaller bars and sediment deposited where the dominant channel migrates little over time (>90% versus 0–30%, respectively). In contrast, preservation was more homogeneous for channel patterns without extensive point bar development. Additionally, preservation and reworking frequency were found to be logarithmically related to each other. Furthermore, at the meander-belt scale, the Sadler effect was prevalent (𝑅2 > 0.95), which makes the preservation of fluvial sediment packages predominantly depend on their age of deposition. At smaller spatial scales, this effect appeared weaker and was particularly modulated for extensive individual bars. Preservation at the scale of accretion packages was dominated by variability or randomness. 

Because these results were largely consistent with previous quantitative analyses for other (natural and modelled) meander belts, an updated conceptual model of preservation was proposed. In this model, drivers of preservation depend on spatiotemporal scale, with each hierarchical level being informed by processes from the levels above and by additional processes at the specified level. It is suggested that preservation of individual bars or meanders is affected by the channel pattern, meandering style, river avulsions, and lithology for the Holocene time period."
"Reactivity of 1,3-Dicarbonyl Compounds with Urea under Physiological Conditions","['Prestifilippo, Gino']","['Nostrum, C.F. van']",2022-07-19T00:01:40Z,EN,"['WAK;urea;urea-binding;1,3-dicarbonyl;wearable artificial kidney;dialysis']",Drug Innovation,"In 2019, it is estimated that the number of people suffering from end-stage kidney disease lies between approximately five to seven million, all of whom are in need of renal replacement therapy. For those of whom a kidney transplant is not an option, a high weekly frequency of dialysis procedures in the hospital is required to replace the function of the kidney.

The development of a wearable kidney device would prove to be a significant improvement on the quality of life of end-stage kidney disease patients, as it would not only provide them with the option to receive treatment independent of the location, but it would allow a more frequent treatment, which would likely reduce the prevalence of uremic symptoms that ultimately contribute to the mortality of the patients. However, the development of such a device is currently hindered due to its inability to effectively remove the smallest uremic toxin – urea.

This thesis builds on the work of Jong et al., which has shown that small-molecule 1,3-dialdehyde structures react rapidly and efficiently with urea, even in highly diluted environments, under acidic conditions. This project focuses on the exploration of the development of 1,3-dialdehyde structures that would react with urea under physiological conditions. Specifically, this is done by varying the substituent in the 2-position of the 1,3-dialdehyde structure to potentially modulate the inherit acidic character of said structures.

Amine-substituted 1,3-dialdehyde structures did not show any significant reactivity towards urea under physiological conditions, facilitating the need for further research in the field. Nevertheless, the novel polymeric structures that were synthesized within the scope of this project could potentially be investigated for other potential uses. Further, the results of this project suggest that the optimization of 1,2-dicarbonyl structures for generating a potent urea sorbent may prove to be more fruitful for the incorporation in a wearable artificial kidney device."

The problems associated with the lack of knowledge can only be overcome by way of involving our future generations. New educational approaches are necessary to create communities that are in sync with the processes of nature for sustainable living. Therefore, the aim of this literature review was to present the stateof-the-art on stimulating ecoliteracy in schools. Relevant articles were systematically selected and analyzed, leaving 18 articles that proved several methods to be successful in increasing ecological literacy. They were summarized and presented in this report, providing current insights in stimulating ecological literacy in schools. This review first presents how natural and designed environments can increase ecological literacy by evoking engagement and motivation in students and teachers. Outdoor activities, like fieldtrips, were mostly represented in the analyzed literature. Limitations to visit real-life natural environments were mainly overcome by new technology strategies, proven effective through their immersive character. Lastly, other out-of-the-box
strategies on increasing ecological literacy were described. They offer effective learning experiences that differ from traditional learning experiences. All strategies serve as inspiration for educators to broaden the horizon of environmental pedagogies and to increase ecological literacy in students: an important aspect of creating a sustainable society."
Unpacking the black box: How convergent prokaryotic features can inform hypotheses regarding eukaryogenesis,"['Eijnatten, Bram van']","['Snel, B.']",2022-07-20T00:00:36Z,EN,[],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"The term eukaryote refers to organisms with cells that contain a nucleus. This is a special cellular compartment in which the DNA is stored. Animals, plants, fungi and protists are all eukaryotes. There are two other domains of life that do not correspond to nucleated cells. These are the bacteria and archeae, collectively referred to as prokaryotes. Current research indicates that eukaryotes have evolved from a merger between an archeum and a bacterium during a long process called eukaryogenesis. Eukaryotic cells are quite complex compared to prokaryotic cells. Apart from the nucleus they also universally contain many  other features that are largely absent from prokaryotic cells. An example is the endomembrane system, which is a set of membranes and cellular compartments that collectively transport and process the molecular components of the cell. How exactly eukaryogenesis took place is still a mystery because all eukaryotic cells have descended from a single ancestor and all intermediate forms of life have gone extinct. This makes it difficult to determine the order in which different cellular features evolved, and the evolutionary pressures that caused them to evolve. Sometimes a prokaryotic species harbors a feature that is very similar to a eukaryotic feature. We can, by comparing the two, use these prokaryotic features to learn about the process of eukaryogenesis. Often these prokaryotes have only one such feature which allows scientists to study it in isolation, rather than in a complex eukaryotic cell. A complex endomembrane, for instance, also occurs in the bacterium G. obscuriglobus. In this literature thesis we show many examples of cellular features that occur in a prokaryote and are very similar to a eukaryotic feature. We than show how these parallel features can be used to form hypotheses about the process of eukaryogenesis. There is a great diversity of prokaryotic organisms on the planet. Only an incredibly small fraction of these has been investigated under the microscope. It is likely that in future work many additional complex features will be discovered in prokaryotes. Our approach will therefore only become more relevant with time."
Begint de bal te rollen bij drugscriminaliteit?,"['Middelaar, Jelle van']","['Bruijn, J.C.M de']",2022-07-21T00:00:35Z,NL,['Voetbalverenigingen; Jonge aanwas; Jongeren; Drugscriminaliteit; Drugshandel; Aanpak; Ondermijning'],Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems,"Deze masterthesis betreft een kwalitatief onderzoek naar de rol van een voetbalvereniging als mogelijke voedingsbodem voor de jonge aanwas in de drugscriminaliteit. Aanleiding voor dit onderzoek waren de onderzoeken over amateursportverengingen die steeds vaker ten prooi vallen aan (criminele) ondermijningspraktijken, zoals drugscriminaliteit. Mogelijk heeft dit een doorwerking op de jonge aanwas in de drugscriminaliteit en is een voetbalvereniging een kwetsbare omgeving hiervoor. Doel van het onderzoek was om, middels het perspectief van professionals en personen binnen voetbalverenigingen, inzicht te geven over dit mogelijke fenomeen. Allereerst is een literatuurstudie gedaan om een eerste inzicht te krijgen in de mogelijke mechanismes. Specifiek is gekeken naar literatuur over ondermijning in de sportsector, jonge aanwas, de betrokkenheid van jongeren bij criminele activiteiten, het begrip voedingsbodem en de (preventieve) aanpak van ondermijning en jonge aanwas. Vervolgens zijn zeventien interviews afgenomen, waarvan twaalf met professionals en vijf met voetbalverenigingen. Tijdens de interviews is gevraagd naar onder andere signalen van jonge aanwas, drugsproblematieken, ondermijningsrisico’s, beleid & aanpak en samenwerking. 
	Uit de interviews kwam naar voren dat er veel onderbuikgevoelens zijn met betrekking tot drugsgebruik- en handel op voetbalverenigingen. Daarnaast zijn er concrete signalen; er wordt drugsafval gevonden op en rond voetbalverengingen en er bevinden zich foute figuren op de parkeerplaatsen. Echter, is het ook een probleem dat moeilijk aan de oppervlakte komt omdat professionals denken dat verenigingen dergelijke problemen binnenskamers houden in verband met negatieve publiciteit. De parkeerplaatsen worden door dealers misbruikt om drugs te verhandelen omdat deze omgeving drugshandel door verschillende kwetsbaarheden faciliteert. Daarnaast is een vereniging een grootschalige organisatie. Dit maakt het moeilijk om toezicht en controle te houden. Er bevinden zich veel personen op een voetbalvereniging, waaronder ook criminele personen. Jongeren zouden daarom mogelijk via dit netwerk meegezogen worden in de drugscriminaliteit. Bovendien heeft een voetbalvereniging, zoals de vrijwilligers, onvoldoende kennis om goed te kunnen signaleren. 
	Voetbalverenigingen kunnen een belangrijke rol spelen in de aanpak van jonge aanwas. Zo kunnen zij verbinding zoeken met de jongeren, signaleren én melden, als voorbeeld dienen voor een gezonde lifestyle en hebben zij een bepaalde zorgplicht. Meer kennis om goed te kunnen signaleren, samenwerking en informatiedeling tussen lokale partijen is hierbij belangrijk en wordt nog onvoldoende benut.
	De conclusies leiden tot een drietal beleidsadviseringen. Ten eerste wordt geadviseerd om bewustwordings- en kennisbijeenkomsten te organiseren voor voetbalverenigingen over ondermijning, (signaleren van) jonge aanwas, drugscriminaliteit en het belang van de verbinding zoeken met jongeren. Ten tweede wordt geadviseerd om meer inzicht te krijgen in de mogelijke integrale samenwerkingsverbanden tussen de lokale partners en voetbalverenigingen. Voetbalverenigingen bezitten mogelijk over waardevolle informatie met betrekking tot de jongeren. Ten derde wordt geadviseerd dat verenigingen zorgdragen voor een veilig en gezond verenigingsklimaat zodat jongeren niet in aanraking komen met drugscriminaliteit. Gemeentes hebben de regie op de aanpak van ondermijning, daarom wordt geadviseerd dat zij hierin een voortrekkersrol moeten pakken."

Global Citizenship Education (GCE) zorgt voor maatschappelijk bewustzijn en betrokkenheid onder leerlingen om hen de wereld in te laten gaan als ‘global citizen’. Maar wat is de best manier om dit te doen, wat zorgt voor het meeste succes in GCE en daarmee voor de meeste blijvende impact onder leerlingen? De belevingswereld van kinderen is hierbij erg belangrijk aangezien dit bepaald wat zij leuk of interessant vinden in het dagelijks leven en dit de impact kan bevorderen of juist belemmeren. Daarnaast is het onderzoeken van verschillende groepen hierbij van belang, omdat de belevingswereld en de leefwereld erg kan verschillen tussen individuen maar ook groepen. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om de succesfactoren te onderzoeken in verband met de aansluiting van de belevings- en de leefwereld van leerlingen. Gebleken uit interviews met 20 docenten op middelbare scholen in Nederland is dat de vormgeving, zoals structuur, de begeleider die voor de klas staat, kritisch denken, de focus op grote differentiatie tussen groepen en aansluiting op de doelgroep van groot belang was om voor impact te zorgen. Op basis hiervan wordt aanbevolen om zich bezig te houden met actualiteit en trends binnen het GCE-materiaal, om te zorgen voor talentvolle begeleiders of docenten die voor de klas staan en zich bezig te houden met representatie, zowel in gender als in etniciteit, aangezien dit zorgt voor meer aansluiting en interesse."
Who reports sexual harassment?: How gender and organisational position shape willingness to report sexual harassment in the workplace,"['Have, Isa van der']","['Drouhot, Lucas']",2022-07-21T00:00:37Z,EN,['Sexual harassment; sexual harassment in the workplace; gender; organisational power; reporting; willingness to report.'],Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems,"The aim of this paper is to investigate willingness to report sexual harassment in the workplace through the effects of gender and organisational power of employed victims. The data used to test the hypotheses was acquired from the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights, collected by the Beleidsonderzoekers in 2021. The results indicate a significant effect of gender on willingness to report, which showed that men are less likely to report being sexually harassed. A relation of position within an organisation and willingness to report was not found, however. An interaction effect of position and gender was not found either. This suggests that the effect of organisational power on willingness to report sexual harassment does not differ between men and women. Policy should focus on promoting reporting sexual harassment among men."

Het uitvoeren van het VN-verdrag Handicap is een onderdeel van het thema inclusie en toegankelijkheid, dat per gemeente wordt opgenomen in een Lokale Inclusie Agenda (LIA).

Sinds twee jaar heeft Gemeente Veenendaal ook een LIA. Bij het opstellen van de LIA waren de adviesraden, externe partners en verschillende afdelingen binnen Gemeente Veenendaal betrokken. In deze studie is onderzocht wat LIA-stakeholders beschrijven als belemmeringen voor de toegankelijkheid van digitale informatie van de Gemeente Veenendaal voor mensen met een beperking. Hierbij is gekeken welke mechanismen volgens hen ten grondslag liggen aan belemmeringen van de digitale toegankelijkheid. Deze inzichten geven antwoord op de vraag welke aanpassingen volgens LIA-stakeholders gedaan kunnen worden om de toegankelijkheid van digitale informatie te verbeteren. Aan de hand van semi- getructureerd diepte-interviews zijn 16 respondenten geïnterviewd.

Tijdens het onderzoek is een extra kwalitatieve stap genomen waarbij de resultaten uit de interviews geanalyseerd zijn door twee respondenten die hebben geparticipeerd aan het onderzoek; één van deze respondenten is een deskundige op het gebied van digitale toegankelijk en werkzaam bij Gemeente Veenendaal.

De belemmeringen die LIA-stakeholders benoemen zijn gebrek aan kennis, bewustwording en beperkte financiële middelen. Er wordt aan Gemeente Veenendaal aanbevolen om eenmaal per jaar aan alle werknemers van Gemeente Veenendaal een interne training over digitale toegankelijkheid te geven om kennis en bewustwording vergroten. Ten tweede wordt aanbevolen dat betrokken afdelingen binnen Gemeente Veenendaal meer gaan samenwerken met elkaar en bewoners met een beperking, zodat er meer vanuit bottom-up strategie wordt geopereerd, in plaats van een top-down strategie."

While the focus of policy is mainly on the effect of training on the ability to continue working, it is equally important to investigate the effect of this on the willingness to continue working. In addition, little research has been done on the direct effect of training on retirement age. This study focused on identifying the effect of training, offered by employers, on the desired retirement age of employees in Western Europe (concentrated on the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Denmark and the UK). The theoretical framework aimed to identify the underlying mechanisms of the effect of training on the willingness to continue working. Amongst other things, this framework proposed that training leads to up-to-date skills that would result in a better job fit, after which employees would choose to stay in work longer, thus hypothesising positive effects on the desired retirement age. Using data from the EWCS6, logistic regression analyses and linear regression analyses were performed. The total sample for the logistic regression analyses was 5,110 respondents and the total sample for the linear regression analyses was 4,134 respondents. The desired retirement age was examined in two ways in this study: according to working beyond the state pension age (logistic) and according to the preferred exit age (linear). The results showed that employees who have received training are less likely to want to continue working beyond the state pension age. In addition, it became apparent that the differences in preferred exit age after training only applied to senior employees. Based on the findings of the study, it was advised, amongst other things, to critically review training as a factor for motivating people to work longer."

There is a growing consensus that innovation and its policies should focus on solving concrete and pressing societal problems. In order to initiate this kind of transformative change, clearly defined missions are formulated, labelled as Mission-oriented Innovation Policy (MIP). Although promising, missions remain understudied in practice. Therefore scholar introduced the Mission-oriented Innovation System (MIS) framework. The mission addressed in this thesis is the mission initiated by the province of Noord-Brabant to have 15% organic agricultural land by 2030 in Noord-Brabant. Since there are different forms of agriculture, each with their own problems and challenges, this study is demarcated on organic horticulture and arable farming. In order to analyse this mission, the five-step structural-functional approach as introduced by Wesseling & Mijerhof (2021) for studying a MIS has been applied. A combination of desk research, expert consultation, and 24 semi-structured expert interviews provided data for these five steps.

The analysis resulted in a multitude of identified barriers related to weakly fulfilled system functions. From these barriers, two networks of interrelated barriers were identified with the most pressing systemic problems. These revolve around the low demand for organic products and the low number of farmers transitioning to organic farming. Thereafter the ongoing or planned mission governance actions were identified that aim to address (some) of these barriers. As for the low demand for organic products, the (planned) mission governance actions do not seem sufficient to overcome the barriers. Therefore, given that resources of the mission arena are limited, various governance actions have been proposed to overcome the identified barriers. One of those recommendations is to draw up a covenant with leading parties in the retail sector to make them jointly responsible and the problem owner for increasing the sales of organic products. In such a covenant, agreements can also be made to partially tackle other identified problems. Regarding the low number of farmers that transition to organic, many of the planned actions seem sufficient for now and should only be reconsidered when the demand for organic products increases. For example, one of the planned actions is a transition fund to help farmers finance the transition. However, it is important to examine whether there is sufficient demand for the products in the markets in which these farmers operate. Otherwise, there is a risk that farmers will be encouraged to grow crops for markets for which there is no demand."

As the social environment is thought to relate to the lifestyles of children, this thesis aims to answer the question of whether improving the social environment can make the lifestyles of children aged 4-12 more healthy. This was researched by a mixed-methods approach. For the quantitative part, data of the Kindmonitor 2017 was used, which was analyzed using the program SPSS. The qualitative part entails interviews with the parents of children in Alblasserdam. As the results of these interviews seemed surprisingly positive, additional interviews with experts in the field were conducted. The results of this study imply that overall a healthy social environment for children is related to a healthier lifestyle. Furthermore, each aspect of the social environment relates to at least one aspect of the lifestyle. To conclude, this research shows that a healthy social environment can certainly contribute to a healthier lifestyle for children. However, this study also shows that, although the average state of the social environments and lifestyles of children are sufficient, there are areas that can be improved, especially for special needs children. Therefore, policymakers should focus on vulnerable children as they score below average. Hereby, the focus should specifically be on leisure activities and peer contact, which can be tackled by providing opportunities for these children to play sports in an organized manner."
"The discovery, analysis and comparison of the patient discharge process - A case study.","['Bainathsah, Noël']","['Beerepoot, Iris']",2022-07-21T00:00:55Z,EN,[],Business Informatics,"Introduction

The quality of business processes is highly dependent on the suitability and efficiency of their execution. Healthcare emphasizes this dependency as the processes within the domain are concerned with activities that aim to diagnose, treat and prevent diseases in order to improve the quality of life for its patients. Process mining aims to discover healthcare processes with a data-driven approach. A common trend among the literature is that the basis of its analysis is an event log that is concerned with hospital-wide patient process that spans multiple departments or only a single department/patient group. The comparison of multiple departments concerned with the same care process is unexplored in current literature.

Objectives This thesis aims to discover, analyse and compare the patient discharge process across three different hospital departments with the use of process mining.

Methods This thesis is a case study using a generalized framework for process mining projects in practise called the generalized PM methodology. The six phases of the generalized PM methodology have been divided into an 8-stage process involving: (1) Planning, (2) Data collection, (3) Log exploration, (4) Log pre-processing, (5) Process model discovery, (6) Model evaluation, (7) Model analysis and comparison, (8) Process improvement. Additional interviews with domain experts were conducted for several stages to fine tune the output for these stages.

Results The results of this thesis give insight in what process mining metrics can be utilized to compare an unstructured care process across several hospital departments and show what type of activities are most prone to showing interdepartmental discrepancies based on the results of the case study."

Despite the implementation of (national) policies, legislations and other initiatives, the gender wage gap has remained resilient. On organizational level, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies and/or initiatives (DEI) have been implemented to create a more equal working environment. However, researchers don’t agree on the effects of these policies. They debate whether DEI policies contribute to a more equal workplace or if they highlight and enlarge the differences between gender. Therefore, the goal of this research was to gain more insights in DEI policies/initiatives and to clarify its effects on the gender wage gap. To do so, we used the European Workforce Survey data (EWFS) from 2018 to test our hypotheses (N=2185). The regression analyses results show that, as expected, we found a wage gap present between the male and female respondents of the EWFS. Next to that, we found that one out of the six tested DEI initiatives/policies has a significant positive effect on the gender wage gap. The other five tested DEI initiatives/policies show no significant effect, meaning they don’t influence the gender wage gap. Based on the results we make recommendations for future research, and we mention our policy advice."

The results of the regression analyses show no significant effect of social capital on the level of trust in the police. However, procedural justice did have a large significant effect on the level of trust in the police. Furthermore, it was found that procedural justice is, to a limited extent, extra important in countries with a high crime rate. Based on this, future research should focus on expanding the examination of the effects of procedural justice on trust in the police, especially in countries with a higher crime rate. The policy advice includes advice on how to incorporate procedural justice in the way the police execute their job, aiming to improve the trust citizens have in the police."

This research has used a multilevel regression analysis on multiple-wave panel data, and included income as a moderating variable, to gain a more thorough understanding of the effect of citizen participation on political trust. A micro-macro interaction approach is used by applying Rational Choice Theory and Social Categorization Theory to explain the effect of citizen participation on political trust. Results show that people who took part in citizen participation meetings had higher political trust. There was no moderation effect, the effect was the same for all income groups. The results confirm previous research and suggest that citizen participation is an effective policy tool to increase political trust, for all income groups."

The inclusion criteria were being a woman, a member of a political party, of voting age and some amount of political interest or ambition. The main outcome of this study is that women feel that they have to work harder than male peers for the same amount of political opportunities. The women feel like they have to prove themselves more, feel scrutinized and belittled.

The conclusion of this paper is that in order to achieve a more equal gender balance, a radical change of the current hostile political culture is needed."

Gemeenten staan hierbij voor de grote uitdaging om woningeigenaren tot woningverduurzaming te bewegen. In dit onderzoek wordt onderzocht hoe capaciteiten, omstandigheden, motieven en levensgebeurtenissen in de vorm van grote onderhoudsmomenten samenhangen met intenties tot verduurzaming van de woning. Hierbij is gebruik gemaakt van survey’s, gehouden in de gemeenten Utrecht en Zeist. In dit onderzoek is de samenhang tussen capaciteiten, omstandigheden, motieven, levensgebeurtenissen en intenties tot verduurzaming van de woning onderzocht met logistische regressiemodellen.

Uit de analyse blijkt dat eigenaar-bewoners met name rond grote onderhoudsmomenten van de woning de intentie hebben ook hun woning te verduurzamen. Daarnaast blijkt dat
woningeigenaren die de intentie hebben hun woning te verduurzamen vaker informatiebronnen raadplegen. Eigenaar-bewoners die al gebruik hebben gemaakt van duurzaamheidssubsidies hebben minder vaak de intentie hun woning verder te verduurzamen. Gemeenten kunnen eigenaar-bewoners die voor een groot onderhoudsmoment staan, bewegen hun woning te verduurzamen met gerichte informatiecampagnes. En eigenaar-bewoners die al een subsidie hebben voor de verduurzaming van hun woning kunnen
benaderd worden met extra informatie over additionele verduurzamingsmogelijkheden. Tot slot lijkt het zinvol om minder hoogopgeleide en vermogende eigenaar-bewoners met
een alternatieve beleidsstrategie te benaderen. Meer onderzoek is nodig naar hoe dit het beste gedaan kan worden."
"Self-made success, achieved together. How and why the DIYbio community engages in DIYbio projects
and what makes them successful","['Voort, Thomas van de']","['Boon, Wouter']",2022-07-21T00:01:13Z,EN,['DIYbio;user innovation;user community; quantitative;qualitative;mixed methods;open collaborative innovation; Do-It-Yourself; project success'],Innovation Sciences,"In order to solve complex sociotechnical challenges scientific research is moving to a more
democratized and socially distributed state. Synthetic biology is one of the fields in which one
such movements has started, called the Do-It-Yourself-Biology (DIYbio) community. Cheaper
equipment, communication technologies and automation of DNA sequencing and -synthesis
increasingly allow DIYbiologists to start experimenting in self-made labs. The DIYbio
community can be classified as a user community engaging in open, collaborative innovation
projects, but it is unclear what makes these projects successful. This research therefore first
investigates how and why the community members engage in DIYbio projects and then what
characteristics make projects successful. User innovation and user community literature is
used, along with literature on project success. Six characteristics are hypothesized to influence
DIYbio project success: regulation, technology and market as industry specific factors and
leadership, knowledge diversity and funding as project specific factors. To find out the
motivations of DIYbiologists, 9 interviews with community, project, startup and lab leaders
from over the world were conducted, transcribed, coded and analyzed. To find out what makes
DIYbio projects successful, a survey was conducted among the DIYbio community with a
response of 32. Ordinary Least Squares regression was performed in R to uncover possible
relationships between the six independent variables and project success, supported by
qualitative data of the interviews. Differences in how and why DIYbio is done are found
between the US, EU and countries in Africa, South-America and Asia and between
technology-oriented people and bio artists. The groups are connected through dissatisfaction
with their jobs, a degree of activism, the urge to seek like-minded people, experimenting in
their free time and an entrepreneurial mindset. A DIYbio project cycle from new to successful
projects in relation to regulation, technology and market is created and key activities to enable
DIYbio project success are defined based on interview data. In the regression analysis, the
variable knowledge diversity is proven to have a positive significant relationship with project
success. The different identified groups in the DIYbio community have different relationships
to the six project characteristics because of their different motivations and cultures. The six
project characteristics all have an influence on project success, but the exact relationships are
more complex than a positive linear relation. The results are reflected on and compared to
user community literature based on Open Source Software which unveils differences between
the two communities."
"Participatie in de provincies, een proefballon of echt in het belang van de burger?","['Berg, Thom van den']","['Michels, Ank']",2022-07-21T00:01:02Z,NL,['Burgerparticipatie;provincies'],Public Governance,"Met de komst van de Omgevingswet werden de Nederlandse provincies voor het eerst geconfronteerd met een grootschalig burgerparticipatietraject. Naast de vele institutionele stakeholders en medeoverheden waar de provincie altijd al mee in gesprek was werd zij nu vanuit het Rijk verplicht om ook burgers plaats te laten nemen aan de spreekwoordelijke vergadertafel. Dat zou een uitdaging worden omdat de provincie de overheidslaag is met de grootste afstand tot de burger en doordat de provincies beperkte ervaring hadden met burgerparticipatie. Ook de rijke verzameling aan wetenschappelijk literatuur op het gebied van burgerparticipatie heeft zich voornamelijk toegespitst op lokale en nationale burgerparticipatie en niet op het sub-nationale niveau waarop een provincie zich bevindt.
Dit onderzoek vertrok daarmee met de gedachte dat de grote afstand van de provincie tot de burger en het gebrek aan onderzoeken naar provinciale burgerparticipatie ertoe zou leiden dat er zich knelpunten voor zouden doen die niet bij landelijke en lokale burgerparticipatie spelen. Dat maakte dat de vraag die in dit onderzoek centraal stond luidt: ‘In hoeverre doen zich knelpunten voor bij het organiseren van burgerparticipatietrajecten door de provincies?’.
Om provinciale burgerparticipatie te analyseren koos dit onderzoek om de trajecten rondom de provinciale omgevingsvisies te vergelijken. De omgevingsvisie was namelijk het eerste grootschalige en verplichte traject waar alle provincies aan moesten voldoen. Ondanks het verplichte karakter werden de provincies wel vrijgelaten in de invulling van burgerparticipatie en dit maakte dat de trajecten tussen de provincies verschilden. Voor de analyse zijn in dit onderzoek het burgerparticipatietraject voor de totstandkoming van de omgevingsvisies van de provincies Utrecht, Groningen, Zuid-Holland, Limburg en Zeeland onderzocht. Om dit te onderzoeken zijn 56 documenten geanalyseerd en zijn zeven interviews gehouden.
In dit onderzoek is gebleken dat er zich wel degelijk knelpunten voordoen die specifiek zijn voor burgerparticipatietrajecten die zijn opgezet door de provincies. Zo werden de provincies verplicht vanuit het Rijk om burgers te laten participeren bij het schrijven van de omgevingsvisies. Dat terwijl de omgevingsvisies van de provincie vraagstukken in de gehele provincie beslaan en het vooral een strategisch beleidsstuk is. Dit maakte dat participatietrajecten in de provincies niet werden opgezet omdat de provincies er zelf in geloofden maar omdat het Rijk hen oplegde dat te doen. Om burgers te laten participeren moesten de kwesties omtrent de omgevingsvisies omgezet worden in concrete vraagstukken. Dit maakte echter dat de inbreng van burgers niet direct aansloot op de wensen van de provincie. Ondanks het feit dat de vraagstukken omgezet waren namen burgers nog altijd vooral deel om hun concrete belangen die in hun eigen omgeving speelden te verdedigen. Deze beperkte effectiviteit van burgerparticipatie maakte, in combinatie met het beperkte geloof in burgerparticipatie door de provincies zelf, dat de provincies altijd terugvielen op hun vaste partners. Met als gevolg dat beleid in de provincies in samenwerking met institutionele stakeholders geschreven wordt en hoogstens aangevuld of gecontroleerd wordt aan de hand van de inbreng vanuit burgerparticipatie. De reden daarvoor lijkt dan ook in elke provincie gelijk: beleid omtrent de omgevingsvisie is te breed en abstract om burgerparticipatie effectief toe te passen."

terms of socialisation, employment, civic engagement and gender.","['Fontaine, Fanny']","['Drouhot, Lucas']",2022-07-21T00:01:00Z,EN,[],Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems,"Many studies have been done on immigrant integration and much research has focused on
volunteering and the motivation for it, but few have looked at the links between them, let alone
compared the two. It is in this context that the following research question is addressed:
To what extent does the volunteering behaviour of immigrants in Europe differ from that of the
general population?
This problem was addressed through a mixed method approach. On the one hand, the
quantitative part uses the ESS round 1, concerning the volunteering behaviour of the European
population. On the other hand, qualitative interviews were conducted to understand in depth
what volunteers earn from their activities. The quantitative results of the logistic regression
show that the volunteering behaviour of immigrants does not differ from that of the general
population. In general, having a job, a greater social capital, being politically engaged and being
women are drivers for volunteering. The qualitative section emphasizesthe importance of social
contacts, learning soft skills and building self-confidence.
The recommendations are addressed to the non-profit volunteering organisation Serve the City
Amsterdam. The recommendations are addressed to the non-profit volunteering organisation
Serve the City Amsterdam and suggest promoting volunteering among the female immigrant
population, which could be based on the learning part of volunteering. In addition, the
organisation advises contacting politicians to encourage them to participate in volunteering and
to strengthen their sense of community."

This has consequences for the care of young children with a complex developmental delay and/or behavioral problems and their parents. Objective: By providing insight into where Integrated Early Aid is still offered and where not, and by looking at which municipal factors influence this, the national coordinator can better support municipalities and try to recreate the nationwide network as much as possible. Theory: The Rational Choice Theory has been taken as a starting point, which is combined with internal and external factors. Investigated are motivation, obstacles, and resources, and how these influence policy decisions. Method: Data was collected with a quantitative study. The policy was measured based on a survey and open data was used for the municipal factors. Binomial logistic regressions were utilized to investigate the relationships. Results: The policy was positively influenced by the obstacle factor information. Resources had no effect and motivation showed different effects. Conclusion and implications: Not all factors were relevant in influencing IEA. The dominant factor was information, which refers to the policy learning principle, in which municipalities look at each other and adopt each other's policies. In contrast with earlier research, resources had no effect. This may have to do with the preventive nature of IEA and the dominant short-term orientation in many policy fields. Further research into fragmented preventive policy is recommended."

This “greening” may not only adversely affect the resilience of dune systems to climate change, but already puts at risk their ecological diversity. While climate has been considered the dominant factor for greening in areas where human activities are limited or rare, on a regional scale over the last century, the role of human interventions has been significant. Whether dune greening is limited to the effects of global warming or is site-specific is largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of this work is to detect and assess the change in vegetation cover over time, at a large number of dunefields worldwide, by using Landsat satellite imagery, and to correlate the identified trends with the trends in the main climatic variables, such as temperature, precipitation and wind speed, in order to decide on the drivers of the change. 
The Climate Engine App (http://climateengine.org/) has been used to retrieve the multitemporal series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8) and those of the climatic variables for the period 1984 – 2021. This has been done for 186 individual coastal dune sites from different continents: Europe (69); South America (33); North America (31); Africa (20); Oceania (29); and Asia (4). The dune systems are evolving locally under different climatic and environmental conditions, and are subjected to different levels of human pressure. 
The main results confirm that greening trends are indeed dominant on a global scale (87.1%), as compared to a few dune sites with sand mobilising trends (9.1%), where the aeolian process dominates the stabilisation, and sites with no change (3.8%). Steeper trends are mostly associated with denser average vegetation cover (greener sites) which is typical for the temperate climates. Those sites also exhibit pronounced NDVI seasonality. About 63% of all significant changes show acceleration over the second half of the study period. The other important result is that the vegetation trends show no statistical relationship with the trends of the climatic variables which has been additionally corroborated by a multiple regression analysis. On one hand, possible explanation may be that the current climate has already reached the threshold of being sufficiently warm and wet, so that the dunes are greening anyway. Therefore, further changes in the climatic variables may become irrelevant to the greening. On the other hand, other regional factors (atmospheric pollution, decline in rabbit population) may play a role. Also, management interventions can explain some of the accelerated greening trends, as well as cases of reduced NDVI at other dune sites, despite local climate favouring greening."

Dit is echter een groot verschil met het imago van het internationale liedjesfestival toen het in 1956 werd opgericht. De winst van de Israëlische zangeres Dana International in 1998 wordt beschouwd als een kantelmoment op het gebied van homo-ontwikkeling binnen het songfestival, maar was dit ook het begin van deze ontwikkeling? 
	Deze scriptie behandelt de beginfase van de interesse vanuit de Nederlandse homogemeenschap in het Eurovisiesongfestival. Hierbij wordt de vraag gesteld wanneer dit ontstond en wat de aanleidingen hiervoor waren. Aanvullend wordt het belang van het songfestival voor liefhebbers uit de homogemeenschap besproken.
 	Voor dit onderzoek zijn verschillende bronnen gebruikt. Ten eerste vormt de secundaire literatuur een leidraad voor de achtergrond van het songfestival en de chronologische ontwikkelingen hierbinnen. Ten tweede is er gebruik gemaakt van vermeldingen van het songfestival in de Gay Krant. Tot slot zijn er, ter aanvulling op de andere data, interviews afgenomen over het songfestival met mensen uit de homogemeenschap.
 	Uit het onderzoekt blijkt dat de interesse vanuit de homogemeenschap zich al eerder vanaf de jaren tachtig steeds sterker ontwikkelde. Naast dat camp-aspecten van het songfestival een bepaalde aantrekkingskracht vormden, zorgde het sociale en verbindende karakter voor een jaarlijks evenement dat met zijn tradities een belangrijke rol is gaan spelen voor mensen uit de homogemeenschap. Daarnaast biedt het feit dat veel fans al vanaf hun jeugd opgroeiden met het songfestival in de gezinssfeer een belangrijk inzicht. De twee fases, het songfestival als brave familieshow en als extravagant regenboog spektakel, die ook twee imago’s vormen, blijken meer overlapping te hebben dan het lijkt."
Caring for your child companion,"['Mulder, Li-An']","['Raessens, J.F.F.']",2022-07-23T00:00:32Z,EN,['ethics of care; care values; The Last of Us; TLoU; child character; childhood; adult-child binary; digital companion; companion character'],New Media and Digital Culture,"This thesis draws on theories of ethics, game and childhood studies to study relationships of care within the video game The Last of Us (Naughty Dog, 2013). First, the philosophical ethics of care framework is discussed and the approach of Murphy and Zagal is expanded to apply to a broader range of games. A textual analysis is performed to focus on child companion Ellie and the care values constructed by TLoU. By drawing on research from game studies the social role of companion characters in ethical gameplay experiences is discussed. Next, research from childhood is used to explore the social status of children in European and North American societies. 

I conclude that the child character Ellie fits the dominant childhood discourses of both innocence and at-risk in the violent world of TLoU. The relationship between player-character Joel and Ellie also fits traditional and passive ideas of childcare, but her character’s abilities and care practices challenge this adult-child binary later in the game. And Ellie performs a dual role of providing diegetic conversations and ludic service within gameplay. In addition, care practices are not prioritised by social groups in the post-apocalyptic world of the game, especially for children.These findings contribute to the intersection of ethics and game studies, but also feminist and childhood studies by highlighting the care practices between adults and children in games."

Het resultaat van het onderzoek was dat vanaf juni uitgebreid over de 
concentratiekampen werd geschreven en dat de kranten door middel van gruwelijke details en 
versterkend taalgebruik hun ontzetting en de onbevattelijkheid aan de lezers probeerde duidelijk 
te maken. Tevens bleek dat de voormalige verzetskranten, in tegenstelling tot wat in de 
historiografie wordt geschreven, Joden vaak specifiek hebben genoemd in verband met de 
concentratiekampen en dat er toen ook al goede schattingen over het aantal Joodse slachtoffers

the Proerosia in the demes, including the Eleusinian deme, and the strong local traditions present in the
demes demonstrate the importance of the deme for Demeter’s cult. This thesis, therefore, presents a
much more varied and multilayered picture of Demeter’s cult and sacred landscape than when viewed
solely from an Eleusinian or Athenian perspective. By including all cult sites of Demeter in this study,
I have shown the value of looking at a polis (Attica) in its entirety. While it is undeniable that the
Eleusinian cult occupied a prominent position in the sacred landscape of the Athenian polis, I have noted
in this thesis the presence of Demeter’s cult in the Attic demes and its importance to the cult and the
sacred landscape of the Athenian polis. As the cult site of Eleusis expanded and became more important
over time in Attica and the Greek world, local agricultural traditions and rites in the demes continued
into the Classical period in Attica as well.
This thesis fits within the scholarly debates about the importance of religion and cults in the
organization and development of the polis, the influence of ancient landscapes on the organization of
ritual space, and more specifically, the influence of Demeter’s cult on the sacred landscape of the
Athenian polis. As already mentioned in the introduction, this thesis is only the beginning of a broader

The findings of previous research were subsequently complimented with an analysis of speeches by representatives of the United Kingdom at the General Assembly of the United Nations. The conclusions regarding this analysis were that climate change steadily became a more important part of British diplomacy, whenever there were no other major crises. Secondly, this master thesis analysed the changing narrative on climate change within nature documentaries of the NHU, as part of BBC programming. This resulted in the conclusion that both climate change specifically and the impact of humans on the environment in general steadily became a more prevalent part of the NHU documentaries over time. When both analyses are compared, the narrative in British climate diplomacy generally matches the narrative within the NHU documentaries. Besides, the correlation between the narrative on climate change within British foreign policy and the NHU documentaries matches the link between British politics and the BBC governance structure. In contrast, the continuity within the production teams of the different nature documentaries does not match their changing narrative, making this factor seem less relevant to its narrative. This implies that the answer to the research question is that BBC programming is part of British nation branding. The existence of the BBC’s missions “representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities” and “bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK” since 2007 explicitly support this conclusion."

youth. The offspring of parents with depression and/or anxiety present a high vulnerability to mental disorders. This study investigates the associations between family functioning and individual symptoms of depression/anxiety in offspring.

Method: Cross-sectional data were collected from 483 offspring (13 to 25 years) of parents treated for depression/anxiety. Family cohesion and flexibility were assessed with the Family Dimensions Scales, depression/anxiety symptoms in offspring were assessed with the DSM- IV questionnaire. A multiple linear regression examined associations of cohesion and flexibility with the number of symptoms in offspring, then logistic regressions were performed for each symptom. A mixed graphical network estimated the direct and indirect links between family functioning dimensions and individual symptoms.

Results: Cohesion was negatively related to total number of symptoms in offspring (ß = - 0.13, p = .007), while flexibility was positively related to symptoms (ß = 0.33, p < .001). Flexibility also had significant individual associations with all symptoms. In the network structure, cohesion showed two negative (anhedonia and suicidality) and one positive link (insomnia), whereas flexibility showed two positive links (guilt and insomnia).

Discussion: High family cohesion has a protective role in offspring depression/anxiety, especially against anhedonia, sadness and worthlessness. Excessive family flexibility is detrimental to offspring, especially via guilt and sleeping problems that are further related to anxiety. Findings suggest that different family factors relate to distinct pathways of symptoms in the offspring and that family interventions should increase cohesion and reduce excessive flexibility."
To adapt or not to adapt: The moderating role of openness to change in the effect of Corporate Social Responsibility on employee satisfaction and commitment.,"['Luiten, Pim']","['Veenstra, Esmee']",2022-07-27T00:01:00Z,EN,[],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","The demand for responsible business practices has been growing steadily for the past few decades among consumers, investors and employees. Because of this, corporations have started to increase Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices, which focuses on economic performance with respect for the social and environmental side. The effects of such practices on consumers, investors, and employees have been widely researched. Namely, employees viewing a CSR strategy as sincere are likely to increase their job satisfaction and commitment. A sincere CSR strategy asks for changes in the company’s routines and operations, and involvement of employees throughout the organization. As employees are central to the implementation of CSR policy, the question arises whether they are able to implement changes and experience effects of those changes, if employees are not open to that change. This study aims to find a model which predicts employee satisfaction and commitment using perceived CSR sincerity and employee openness to change. Using an cross-sectional between-subjects design (N = 109), a moderation analysis was performed with self-reported data to find the influence of openness to change on the effect of perceived CSR sincerity on employee satisfaction and commitment. An effect of perceived CSR sincerity on employee satisfaction and commitment is found, further supporting previous research. No significant results have been found on the moderating role of openness to change, nor on the direct effect of openness to change on employee satisfaction and commitment.

Testosterone and cortisol were measured with salivary samples. Results showed that testosterone with cortisol as a moderator did not have any predictive value, but psychopathic personality traits did have a strong predictive value. Future research should therefore focus less on the testosterone and delinquency relation among adolescents and shift the attention more towards psychopathic personality traits in order to develop interventions which can help reduce violent delinquency among adolescents."

Nonetheless, this vital role is typically undervalued. Similarly, the associated task of supported decision-making, which fall under the umbrella of caregiving, is often overlooked. This paper will report on a specific subset of family caregivers who care for a family member with acquired brain injury (ABI) - more commonly known as stroke survivors. These care recipients often suffer from impaired cognitive capacity and are thus in need of guidance in decision-making. The primary purpose of this research is to determine the ethical justification of the supported decision-making process of voting. Despite the need for assistance, this research will demonstrate that ABI-individuals should be included in the voting process. However, due to impaired ability to communicate, think, and learn, others may often be too quick to dismiss their decision-making capacity or discredit their judgment. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to serve as ethical guidance on how the family caregiver should approach the supported decision-making process of voting and how to reconstruct values and political preferences to reach a shared and informed political decision. My research reflects a relational approach to supported decision-making and will illustrate that the family caregiver has an ethical responsibility to engage with the care recipient by not only incorporating and acting upon pre-stroke values, but also including post-stroke values to ensure that their voice is adequately represented in the political decision. In particular, this thesis argues that the caregiver should follow the moral criteria of placing the emphasis on respecting the dignity of the current self, instead of solely focusing on the autonomous person who one was prior to the affliction of brain damage. In doing so, post-stroke values should be included in the supported voting process."

It shows how the use of these concepts can provoke epistemic injustice being done to patients by creating hierarchies of epistemic positions and by exclusion of marginalised groups. It is argued that instead of experiential knowledge, we should start using the term ‘patient knowledge’. In order to do this it is examined whether a capabilities approach could be a suitable theoretical framework to involve patient knowledge into care in a morally just way. Therefore, three arguments in favour of– and against– a capabilities approach are introduced, exploring if it can provide an equitable design for reshaping patient participation policies within The Netherlands. It was concluded that an essentialist capabilities approach can provide an equitable framework for patient participation on an institutional (macro) level. At an individual (micro) level, it can provide a starting point for the conversation between physicians and patients, but leaves the freedom to interpret the framework to the patient and the physician. The task of the physicians is to create the space for good communication, by, for instance, using tools as a prelude for the conversation or by the acquisition of both moral and epistemic virtues."
Transfer bij Nederlandssprekenden met het Riffijns als moedertaal: een kwalitatief onderzoek onder eerste generatie Marokkanen in Nederland en Vlaanderen.,"['Boshove, Iza']","['Nortier, Jacomine']",2022-07-28T01:02:18Z,NL,['transfer; NT2; interferentie; Tarifit; Riffijns; Nederlands; contrastieve-analyse;'],Meertaligheid en taalverwerving,"Tijdens mijn stage schreef ik op basis van descriptieve literatuur een contrastieve analyse
(CA), waarin ik het Riffijns met het Nederlands vergeleek. Hieruit kwamen meerdere
mogelijkheden voor positieve en negatieve transfer bij cursisten Nederlands als tweede taal
(NT2’ers) met het Riffijns als moedertaal (T1). Ik besloot de mogelijkheden als hypotheses te
vormen en die te toetsen in het huidige onderzoek. Zo werd de CA Riffijns-Nederlands dus
als uitgangspunt genomen voor dit onderzoek. De acht hypotheses betroffen uitspraak,
weglating van het pronominaal subject, tijd en aspect, bepaald lidwoord, onbepaald lidwoord,
volgorde van hoofdtelwoord, volgorde van rangtelwoord en gebruik van infinitieven.
Om de hypotheses te beantwoorden werden data verzameld uit interviews van eerste
generatie Marokkanen in Nederland en Vlaanderen. In totaal werden vijf video’s via YouTube
geraadpleegd, met daarin acht sprekers. De sprekers hadden allen het Riffijns als T1. Ook
leerden ze rond of na hun twintigste levensjaar het Nederlands. Alle sprekers woonden al
minstens 30 jaar in Nederlandstalig gebied en waren gevorderde NT2-sprekers. De dataset
voor het huidige onderzoek bestaat uit 116 uitingen, verdeeld over de acht categorieën.
Uit de analyse blijkt dat veel sprekers, ondanks hun gevorderde NT2-fase, interferentie
en positieve transfer laten zien. Ook is er veel variatie bij sprekers en soms binnen dezelfde
spreker. De hypotheses over klinkeruitspraak, tijd en aspect, bepaald lidwoord, onbepaald
lidwoord en volgorde van hoofdtelwoord worden aangenomen. De hypotheses over weglating
van het pronominaal subject, volgorde van rangtelwoord en het gebruik van infinitieven
worden verworpen.
Afgaand op de resultaten lijkt de CA Riffijns-Nederlands transfer redelijk vaak juist te
voorspellen. Bovendien moet er in acht worden genomen dat transfer duidelijker te zien is bij
NT2’ers in een beginnende fase. Dat het merendeel van de verwachte transfer ook nog bij de
gevorderde groep te zien is, lijkt mij reden om te concluderen dat de CA een accurate
voorspeller is. Echter, hier is nog meer onderzoek voor nodig."
"Female Rivalry, Psychoanalysis and the Marriage Market economy in Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey and Lady Susan.","['Barkmeijer, Ilse']","['Janssen, Flore']",2022-07-28T01:02:08Z,EN,['Jane Austen; Female Rivalry; Marriage Market; Psychoanalysis; Northanger Abbey; Pride and Prejudice; Sense and Sensibility; Lady Susan'],Literatuur vandaag,"This thesis explores female rivalry within an eternal triangle (two women compete for one man), and its effect on female relationships in four novels by Jane Austen: Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Northanger Abbey (1818), and Lady Susan (1871). Female rivalry is explored in these novels by means of psychoanalysis and the concept of the marriage market. Though the concepts of psychoanalysis and the marriage market seem to have nothing in common, both concepts objectify and value women. Analysis of the four novels shows how the objectification and valuation of women creates an environment in which women feel the need to compete with one another. The first part of the analysis focuses on Lady Susan and Sense and Sensibility, in which psychoanalytic ideas are most present. This in combination with important themes such as communication and rivalry within the family makes that this chapter shows various forms of female rivalry and its effect on the relationships between the female characters. The same happens in the second analysis chapter. This chapter, however, looks at Northanger Abbey and Pride and Prejudice, and has a heavier focus on the concept of the marriage market. In this chapter, even more forms of female rivalry arise, and various female characters can be seen actively trying to change their status through marriage by means of rivalry with other women. The conclusion shows how Austen uses female rivalry within her novels to reflect on the marriage market. The ways in which the characters compete against one another, and the fact that the women who are regarded as ‘bad’ through their valuation end up losing the rivalry within the eternal triangle, shows that Austen’s works are negative towards the marriage market system."

Using theoretical models provided by Jean Baudrillard, Roland Barthes, and Guy Debord, it will explore the idea of simulation and simulacra in the context of the postmodern era and apply it to several primary texts during close readings. The texts will be examined in chronological order (with minor exceptions) and will be shown to illustrate a movement from the idea of confinement, or imprisonment, towards escape, or freedom. Beginning with the proto-theme parks of Donald Barthelme’s short fiction, it will then analyse John Barth’s “Lost in the Funhouse,” David Foster Wallace’s “Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way,” several short stories by George Saunders, “Zimmer Land” by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, and, finally, Swamplandia! By Karen Russell. The ultimate goal will be to arrive at a conclusion that plots an escape route from the traps of simulation, and, through these texts, breaks free of the oppressive regimes imposed by American capitalism and the postmodern era."

Dit is gedaan aan de hand van een uitgebreid literatuuronderzoek en een tweeledig verkennend kwalitatief onderzoek waarbij enerzijds Oekraïners zijn geïnterviewd over hun ervaring met het Oekraïense schoolsysteem en hun ervaring in Nederland, en anderzijds docenten een vragenlijst hebben ingevuld over hun ervaring met Oekraïense vluchtelingen in de klas.
Uit dit onderzoek is allereerst gebleken dat docenten Oekraïense vluchtelingen het best kunnen ondersteunen door ruimte te maken voor en rekening te houden met hun moedertaal, zodat de vluchtelingen het Nederlands zo snel mogelijk oppikken. Verder is het met het oog op de leerprestaties belangrijk dat docenten een veilige omgeving creëren in de klas. Ook wordt geadviseerd dat docenten waar mogelijk differentiëren op basis van lengte van verblijf, omdat dit de behoeften van de vluchtelingen sterk kan beïnvloeden. Als laatste is gebleken dat docenten alert moeten zijn op symptomen van trauma. Dit kan direct voorkomen, maar ook pas na meerdere maanden optreden. Het is belangrijk dat docenten weten waar ze terecht kunnen, wanneer de situatie zich voordoet.
Omdat dit een kleinschalig verkennend onderzoek was naar de behoeften van Oekraïense vluchtelingen in Nederland, kunnen de conclusies niet gegeneraliseerd worden. Wel kan aan de hand van dit onderzoek worden geconcludeerd dat meer onderzoek nodig is, om ervoor te zorgen dat Oekraïense vluchtelingen zo goed mogelijk opgevangen en ondersteund kunnen worden, zoals een onderzoek op grotere schaal naar de behoeften van Oekraïense vluchtelingen zowel in als buiten het onderwijs."

An important concern is if the surrogate will be able to act as an autonomous agent during the surrogacy process. In this thesis the question will be answered if a regulated surrogacy market that respects the surrogate’s autonomy can be an alternative to altruistic surrogacy in The Netherlands. The aim of this thesis is to take a first step in arguing that a regulated surrogacy market is preferable over altruistic surrogacy under specific circumstances that will be outlined in this thesis. Several arguments against a surrogacy market will be discussed. These include concerns about the bond that may develop between the surrogate and the fetus, the role of the identity of the surrogate in this process, concerns about the surrogate changing her mind and the impact of the patriarchal and capitalistic society on the ethical permissibility of altruistic surrogacy in The Netherlands. A first step will be made in proposing a regulated surrogacy market that is built on a the distinction between fetus and child stating that the surrogate is responsible for the fetus and the intended parents for the child."

It is said that Global Environmental Governance creates the opportunity for a variety of actors to participate because the environmental crisis affects everyone on this planet. This argumentation hides two assumptions, namely that everyone on the planet is affected equally and that everyone has the same opportunity to participate in governing the problem. However, as this study will show, there are barriers inherent to the way the crisis has been governed that prevent parts of the world from participating equally, such as the authority on scientific knowledge. Moreover, as the focus on the Pacific Islands will demonstrate, the climate crisis is experienced in very different ways that have led to different perceptions of what is happening and what should be done. By not taking these various perceptions into account, Global Environmental Governance cannot be seen as truly global. At the same time, Pacific Islanders have managed to make themselves heard on the international stage and through storytelling they have influenced the social reality of the global leaders and thereby contributing to a different course of governance."

toe. Echter is het mechanisme wat hieraan ten grondslag ligt nog onderbelicht in de literatuur. 
Tevens speelt de institutionele context bij burn-out risico een rol. Public service motivation
(PSM) speelt hierbij een belangrijke rol, echter is het vooralsnog onduidelijk of PSM fungeert 
als personal resource of als personal demand. Dit onderzoek draagt bij door te focussen op de 
theorievorming van PSM en burn-out risico. Hierbij zal antwoord worden geven op de vraag: 
Hoe speelt public service motivation een rol bij burn-out risico van medewerkers in de publieke 
sector binnen een people-changing organization? Hiervoor is data afgenomen binnen een 
people-changing organization, namelijk Dialogue. In totaal zijn er twaalf semigestructureerde 
interviews afgenomen. De resultaten laten zien dat een gebrek aan autonomie, verbondenheid 
en een gevoel van competentie leidt tot meer stress en de kans op burn-out risico vergroot. Dit 
lijkt te impliceren dat de Self-determination theory (SDT) een verklaring is van de loss cycle. 
Daarnaast tonen de resultaten aan dat wanneer er sprake is van een needs-supplies fit, dit over 
het algemeen leidt tot minder stress. Dit lijkt te impliceren dat de invloed van PSM op de loss 
cycle eerder fungeert als personal resource dan een personal demand. Echter blijkt dat wanneer 
er sprake is van een lage societal impact potential (SIP) dit zowel niet stress verhogend als 
stress verlagend werkt. Hieruit blijkt dat het mechanisme needs-supplies fit op zichzelf niet 
toereikend is om de werking van PSM te verklaren. De rol van PSM is namelijk complexer en 
bevat mogelijk extra dimensies die in de toekomst nader onderzocht dienen te worden Het is 
mogelijk dat coping resources hierbij een rol bij spelen, met name positieve herinterpretatie. 
Praktisch gezien is het van belang om in te spelen op autonomie, verbondenheid en een gevoel 
van competentie om de kans op burn-out risico te verminderen. Daarnaast wordt er aanbevolen 
om coping resoures aan te leren en toe te passen, zodat de medewerkers beter met de demands 
om kunnen gaan. Vervolgonderzoek dient de resultaten ook empirisch te toetsen."

However, the utility of COS is difficult as knowledge about the global COS budget is incomplete. In this project we aim to reduce this knowledge gap. 
We are the first to investigate COS fluxes measured with Eddy Covariance (EC) on a Northern latitude fen and we analyze COS fluxes at a boreal forest. Furthermore, by date, this is the first study identifying  the isotopic signature of COS (34S, 33S and 13C) at these ecosystems at various heights, light availability and seasons.
The most important finding is that the fen is a stable sink for the studied period (May-September 2019) with a median COS flux of -9.15 pmol/m-2s-1 (-16.2 and -4.42 pmol/m-2s-1 25%-75%  range).
The diurnal cycle is primarily driven by photosynthesis active radiation. Upscaling this sink for all Northern latitude wetlands, results in little but significant increase of the Northern Hemisphere COS sink. Finally, we successfully used  the data as a proxy for the GPP estimations on the fen.
The isotopic signatures have a mean falling within literature ranges and show little difference between the sites, seasons and among the vertical gradient suggesting non fully active ecosystems during our sampling period (February-April 2022).
Herewith, we prove the practical utility of the pre-concentration chromatography - isotope ratio mass spectrometer developed at IMAU which gives rise to new study opportunities. 
In summary, we show the importance of COS measurements on Northern latitude wetlands as we suspect them to be a stable sink and we report a new dataset of COS isotopic signatures. All this is done to improve the understanding of COS and the atmospheric carbon cycle."

This is then branched out into diving a bit into how D/deaf people experience music and their way of giving sound meaning. Sound does not need to be orally received in order to be sound. In that line of thinking, music does not need to be orally received in order to still be music. The Deaf community mainly, depending on their level of deafness, experiences music through visuals as well as vibrotactile rhythm. This vibrotactile way of experiencing music is then brought into the spotlight by highlighting two devices intended to heighten the vibrotactile experience of music.	
	An audiovisual analysis is then given of the film Sound of Metal to offer a musicological perspective on what exactly the music adds to the film and what effects are created. This is done to illustrate what effects would need to be translated in order for D/deaf people to experience the film music in their own way but resembling the effects it has on hearing people. These effects range from point of hearing changes to the fantastical and musical gap. 
	Lastly it is explained how the vibrotactile sensations are limited in comparison to auditory sensations. Therefore, translation difficulties arise. However, when it comes to translating the point-of-hearing changes, vibrotactile music has its advantages over auditory music because one is able to feel the vibrations where the Deaf characters on screen feel them too, creating both a literal and metaphorical resonance with the characters on screen by being able to relate mentally and physically."

The results show that type of causality is not associated with word order or the connective that is used. All three Dutch forward causal connectives (cf. ‘so’) – dus, daarom, and daardoor – can be used to express all types of causality. Concerning prosodic marking, non-volitional objective causality causes longer connective duration and is associated with more frequent production of pauses. Type of causality did not affect F0, pause duration, speech rate, or declination reset. These findings do not correspond with prior research by Hu et al. (2019, 2022), who found that there is a trade-off between the use of prosodic and morphosyntactic means in expressing type of causality. The findings do not correspond with the hypotheses of the current study either, as a slower speech rate, longer connectives and pauses, and higher F0 values were expected to be associated with subjective causality. The results were obtained from a revised version of the dialogue experiment that was introduced by Hu et al."

Currently, most sandy coastal interventions are sited at open-ocean coastal systems and consist of a uniform sediment mixture (e.g. ‘Sand engine’ at the Holland coast). However, there is also a need for sustainable coastal protection measures in more sheltered coastal environments such as estuaries, deltas and bay-side beaches. In addition, natural coastal systems often consist of a wide range of sediment sizes which can substantially alter the morphodynamic processes. Therefore, it is essential to understand the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes to predict the evolution of sheltered coastal interventions with non-uniform sediments.

This study applies the widely used morphodynamic Delft3D model to study the sediment transport dynamics of such a system. The ‘Prins Hendrikzanddijk’ (PHZD), situated on the bay side of the Texel barrier island in the Dutch Wadden Sea, is used as a prototype system for a sheltered coastal intervention with non-uniform sediments. A Delft3D model is set up for the PHZD and the hydrodynamics are extensively calibrated with wave height and velocity data from a 6-week field campaign. The design of the model experiments is twofold: 1) the environmental boundary conditions are systematically varied to identify the role of different drivers (waves, tides, winds) on sediment transport, 2) the number of sediment sizes and initial bed composition is varied to
determine the role of graded sediments and the bed composition on sediment transport. In order to model the bed composition changes, a multi-layer bed stratigraphy module is applied.

The results show that the sediment transport is a function of the wind velocity, wind direction and the geometry of the basin. During moderate energetic conditions, the orbital wave motion dominates the bed-shear stress. However, for more extreme storm conditions, the wind- and wave-driven currents become increasingly more important. With an increasing number of sediment fractions, the total sediment transport converges towards a larger suspended transport and a smaller bedload transport compared to a single fraction. Furthermore, the process of preferential transport, hiding and exposure effect and bed armoring are modelled by the multi-layer bed stratigraphy. Nevertheless, the hydrodynamic conditions are of greater importance for the bed evolution than the bed composition as there is little difference in bed level changes for an initial fine or a coarse bed composition. In addition, it is shown that the initial vertical bed composition is crucial for bed composition changes. However, the multi-layer bed stratigraphy model threats the sediment transport as diffusive fluxes while the observations show the deposition of discrete layers. Therefore, the model is not able to reproduce the observed vertical sorting."
Gender Trouble: Threat and Challenge Reactions Towards Gender-Inclusive Initiatives,"['Zeilstra, Dominik']","['Wickham, Miriam']",2022-08-03T00:01:40Z,EN,['Gender-inclusive initiatives ; Threat ; Challenge'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","As the binary categorization of gender/sex is facing growing social and scientific resistance, gender-inclusive initiatives such as all-gender toilets are one way to work towards a more gender-inclusive future. However, as they question the gender/sex binary, gender-inclusive initiatives might pose threats for the social identity of individuals. They might also challenge them to look beyond the gender/sex binary and work towards more gender inclusivity. Threat and challenge reactions might therefore be key factors in predicting the approach attitudes people hold towards gender inclusivity. With this study, we aimed to provide insights about threat and challenge reactions towards two different gender-inclusive initiatives, namely multi-gendering and de-gendering initiatives. In an online survey with a predominant number of cisgender respondents, articles about a clothing store introducing a non-binary gender/sex label (multi-gendering) or abolishing all gender/sex labels (de-gendering) were shown. Threat and challenge reactions were assessed to measure how the respondents’ social identity was affected when confronted with one of the two initiatives. Furthermore, we investigated how threat and challenge reactions related to approach attitudes towards achieving gender inclusivity. In line with our hypothesis, the results showed a significantly higher level of threat in the de-gendering condition than in the multi-gendering condition. This difference was absent for the challenge reactions. Furthermore, as hypothesized, threat and challenge were shown as significant predictors for approach attitudes. These results suggest that multi-gendering initiatives are less threatening than de-gendering initiatives. These are important insights because threatened people are less likely to approach gender inclusivity. On this basis, the concepts of threat and challenge reactions should be considered when designing gender-inclusive initiatives."
Dispositional Optimism and Exercise Behaviour: The Moderating Role of Trait Self-Control,"['Fourie, Lisa']","['Versteegt, Lisanne']",2022-08-03T00:01:39Z,EN,['dispositional optimism; trait self-control; exercise behaviour; physical activity'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Extensive research has shown that dispositional optimism has a positive impact on physical and psychological health and well-being. The present study looked at the relationship between dispositional optimism and one health-related behaviour in particular, namely exercise behaviour. Enough exercise is important for several health and well-being reasons, leaving people with good intentions to exercise, but the majority do not manage to follow through. People face daily distractors and temptations, which act as obstacles in their pursuit of a healthier lifestyle. A trait that helps combat this dilemma is self-control. The first hypothesis was that dispositional optimism would be positively associated with exercise behaviour; and the second was that trait self-control would moderate this relationship. Previous research on the topic has been somewhat mixed, hence the addition of a moderating variable to potentially help explain inconsistent findings. Data was collected using a survey study and participants were recruited via the network of the researcher. The final sample consisted of 283 participants. Results revealed no association between dispositional optimism and exercise behaviour in this study, and no moderating effect of trait self-control, which left both hypotheses unsupported. However, a significant positive association was found between trait self-control and exercise. These results raise questions regarding the effects of optimism on specific health-related behaviours, implying that more research is required in this field. Though somewhat indirectly, the findings also add to the large pool of research on the positive impact of trait self-control on behaviour."
Examining the Relation between Mindful Organizing and Affective Commitment Along With the Mediating Roles of Perceived Relatedness and Well-being.,"['Scheel, Josephia']","['Weiss, Laura']",2022-08-03T00:01:38Z,EN,[],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Background. Mindful organizing is characterized by a continuous exchange of ideas,
thoughts, and information, allowing teams to work nearly error-free under high-risk circumstances. With rising numbers of research being done on the outcomes of mindful organizing, the number of inconsistencies is growing respectively. There are two opposing lines of research concerning the affective and attitudinal outcomes of mindful organizing, with one pointing to the detrimental and one to the beneficial effects of the construct. Objectives. It is hypothesized that mindful organizing is positively linked to well-being, perceived relatedness, and affective commitment. Moreover, it is proposed that first, perceived relatedness explains the relationship between mindful organizing and well-being, and second, that well-being explains the link between mindful organizing and affective commitment.
Methods. By applying a cross-sectional study design, 80 employees took part in an online survey. Two mediation analyses were conducted.
Results. Results indicated that mindful organizing was positively linked to well-being, perceived relatedness, and affective commitment. However, no evidence for the mediating roles of perceived relatedness and well-being was found.
Conclusions. I conclude that mindful organizing has the potential to produce positive affective and attitudinal responses in employees, working in non-high-reliability organizations. Thereby, this paper makes valuable contributions to the mindful organizing literature, by resolving controversies regarding the proposed positive and negative outcomes of the construct.

Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in forests: Do the same processes drive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships above- and belowground in forests?,"['Schiphof, Lotte']","['Barry, K.E.']",2022-08-03T00:01:36Z,EN,[],Environmental Biology,"Climate change and deforestation are presenting huge threats to forest biodiversity. This decline poses a risk to the ecosystem functioning of forests. The processes determining how biodiversity impacts ecosystem services in forests can differ between above- and belowground communities. This literature review provides an overview of the different processes driving the above- and belowground biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in forests. Evidence for both the complementarity effect hypothesis and the selection effect hypothesis was evaluated. Among the complementarity causes (i.e. spatial partitioning, temporal partitioning, partitioning across the chemical form of nitrogen, resource enrichment, physical stress buffering, negative and positive biotic feedback) that enhance ecosystem functioning, spatial partitioning is predominant above- and belowground in forests. In addition, temporal partitioning and physical stress buffering were also widely found to drive the aboveground positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship. Whereas partitioning across the chemical form of nitrogen together with the overlap between resource enrichment and positive biotic feedback, via nitrogen fixing species and mycorrhizae, enhances belowground ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, the selection effect hypothesis can also act as a driver of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship above- and belowground in forests. Compared to aboveground studies, belowground processes are poorly studied. Therefore, future research should focus on providing a more detailed picture of the belowground processes driving biodiversity and their effect on ecosystem functioning. Which could increase the efficiency of management and conservation of ecosystem functioning in forest."

The Cognitive Mechanisms of Nudging in the Context of Healthier Food Choices,"['Pitkänen, Sara']","['Maanen, Leendert van']",2022-08-03T00:01:23Z,EN,['nudging; food decisions'],Applied Cognitive Psychology,"Nudging refers to ways to influence one’s decisions, however, the cognitive mechanisms of nudging are not fully understood. In this study, we wanted to learn more about the cognitive mechanisms of nudging in the context of making food decisions. We did this with an experiment where participants rated preferences for healthy and unhealthy food items and made decisions between two food items under four different conditions; baseline, nudge, time pressure and nudge and time pressure combined. We wanted to ask the following questions: will the participants choose the nudged item more often, can we nudge people to select a healthy item, does the time pressure strengthen the effect of the nudge, and will the ratings of the items influence the decisions? We first hypothesized that participants would select the nudged items more often, and that time pressure would increase this effect. Finally, we expected that the preferences would influence these decisions. This study demonstrated that participants selected the nudged items more often, however, they did not select the healthy nudges more often. There was a significant effect on the ratings of the items; meaning that people selected what they liked. Contrary to our expectations, time pressure did not influence these decisions. These results could have implications on how and where to use nudges effectively."
Writing with the Left Hand: Reading(s) of Bilingual Author's Style(s),"['Herold, Pascale']","['Brillenburg Wurth, Kiene']",2022-08-06T00:00:41Z,EN,"['L2 writing, translingualism, exophony, bilingual writing, stylometry, stylistics, bilingual style, style']",Comparative Literary Studies,"It is a common belief that the mother-tongue is the only language in which one may properly think, feel, and express oneself. In this view, second language (L2) writing is often considered second-rate writing. One line of argumentation, often adopted by L2 writers themselves, suggests that literary “style” is the crowning achievement of language-mastery, and so reserved for the native speaker. Yet, systematic studies of the features of L2 style have been scarce. That is why I seek to answer the question: what does literary L2 writing look like stylistically?
To answer this question, I examine the L2 writing style of two authors who wrote intermittently in L1 and L2: Samuel Beckett and of Jhumpa Lahiri. Combining distant- and close reading, I compare L1 and L2 style by use of function words, vocabulary, literary devices, tropes, and language-use as well as lexical diversity and sentence-length with the aim to assess the importance of multilingual competencies for literary writing. Moreover, I examine whether acquiring and writing in L2 has an impact on later L1 style. I show that L2 writing is different from L1 writing, that it tends to be more personal and introspective, employs significantly more first-person narrative perspective, is lexically more diverse than L1 writing, and uses language in a novel and idiosyncratic way, bearing witness to an engagement with L2 textual constructions of meaning. These findings are relevant not only for rethinking the status of L2 writing, but also for evaluating the importance of multilingual competences in, for example, education."

not of any political use or interest. Therefore the question I shall be answering throughout this work

I shall carry out my research through a close reading of two of Camus’ most robust 
philosophical works: The Myth of Sisyphus and The Rebel. I will then seek to explicate the central
political concept in Camus’ work, ‘rebellion’, why it is central and why it is political character. I will 
show how rebellion, culminating in political revolution, can go wrong for Camus by reference to 
particular historical and intellectual revolutions. Finally, I will conclude that when rebellion goes right 
it functions on concrete political principles which affirm the value and freedom of human lives, these 
being the positive premises from which it sets out. Such principles include the limitation of violence, 
inclusive struggle, aimed at democratic political society paired with a socialist economy."

I use a VAR model and Granger causality test to establish the relationship in the context of Aruba. This research finds that a strong unidirectional flow exists from HD to EG, but not the other way around. In addition, I provide insights into the possible reasons for the results. Although this relationship is unstable over the studied period, and HDI does not capture all aspects of wellbeing, this study’s results are important for its implications for Aruban development policies and stakeholders interested in achieving sustainable economic growth and development in SIDS.

This thesis covers this knowledge gap by building on the existing literature around cross-sector social partnerships and extending the previous research on Collaborative Value Creation (CVC). We followed a qualitative multiple case-study research with data collection through semi-structured in-depth interviews and archival data of the multinationals’ annual reports in order to investigate the value and the setting of social partnerships for multinational enterprises. To produce results, we expanded on prior research, created a hybrid Skeletal Framework and used both inductive and deductive coding techniques. We found evidence that social partnerships entail transformative effects for the meso, micro and macro environments of the partnerships and MNEs obtain synergistic value. This study has important implications for future social partnership research since it serves as a stepping stone to explore and further develop a framework around partnerships with social enterprises."

previous literature and research about behavioral consistency and how personal
characteristics and ideologies of CEOs work through to corporate decision making. Empirical
results were based on a sample of 138 firms in the Netherlands stock market index from
2017-2021. The results suggest that right-wing CEOs are not less likely to engage in M&A
activities, which is contradictory with previous literature and the first proposed hypothesis, as
right-wing CEOs were considered to be more conservative in their corporate investment
decisions. However, the effect is not found significant. It is found that right-wing CEOs are
less likely to use stock as a payment method. The direction is consistent with the hypothesis,
but not a significant result is found. Right-wing CEOs are significantly less likely to engage
in focus-increasing deals, which is not consistent with earlier argumentation about their
preference to remain the status quo and preference for familiar stimuli. This research makes
an important contribution to already existing research as it considers the dutch political

The carbon beta is the sensitivity of an asset towards the brown minus green portfolio. The brown minus green portfolio is constructed by taking a long-position in the 30% most pollutive companies and a short-position in the 30% least pollutive companies. The level of pollution is measured by the Greenhouse Gas scope 1 & 2 CO2 emissions. The brown minus green portfolio is a self-financing portfolio. The carbon beta is validated through industry-level and country-level carbon betas, which align with expectations about climate level exposure in industries and countries. The existence of a pollution premium is researched through regressing excess returns on the carbon beta whilst controlling for known return factors. The results are mixed. There is no pollution premium across sectors and Eurozone countries, however there is a large negative pollution premium within industries and Eurozone countries."

This paper started by exploring the topics internationalization and higher education; what the effects are of internationalization and how internationalization links to the linguistic landscape of a higher education intuition. Although several studies explored these topics, this study wants to add to the already existing literature by examining the extent of internationalization of the linguistic landscape of a specific university, namely Utrecht University. This was done by conducting fieldwork on the premises of Utrecht University. At each building that Utrecht University owns pictures of signs were taken inside and outside of the entrance. With these pictures, an analysis was conducted. Through this analysis, it was determined which actors placed signs, in which language and where. In addition, the experience of international students was investigated through a questionnaire. This questionnaire existed of ten signs accompanied by questions that determined if they understood what the signs meant. The answers of the respondents were compared to each other. The main finding of this study is that there are three social actors who create signs and that the international students mostly do not understand Dutch signs; even though the signs are relatively simple. Through this, the conclusion was drawn that the linguistic landscape of Utrecht University is diverse and to some extent internationalized."

This study examines the applicability of Gilbert's emotion regulation model by investigating personal drives in people with fibromyalgia, their perceived importance, and the possible relationship to somatic symptoms. We hypothesized that the resulting drives would be based on evolutionary social needs and focused on controlling fibromyalgia pain and coping with the condition. We expected drives related to the control of fibromyalgia pain to be correlated to higher levels of somatic symptoms.
Methods: a concept mapping design was used to gather qualitative data from participants on an international scale regarding personal drives; this resulted in an extensive overview of forty drives. 74 participants with a self-reported fibromyalgia diagnosis, with ages between 22 and 56, sorted and ranked these drives based on their perceived similarity and then on perceived importance; data regarding socioeconomic status was gathered and the PHQ-15 questionnaire to assess somatic symptoms.
Results: Hierarchical cluster analysis yielded four clusters named interconnectedness, positive mindset, adjusted personal development, and healthy me-time. Participants ranked cluster positive mindset as the most important. No correlations were found between the perceived importance of clusters and somatic symptoms, except for one item called traveling.
Conclusion: Gilbert's evolutionary social motivations were found amongst the clustered drive items, but no items were directly related to somatic symptoms. Other drives involved deficiency and growth needs; many drives were also related to psychotherapeutic goals of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Compassion-Focused Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Positive Psychology. This study provides an extensive overview of forty drives that may aid future research in choosing relevant outcome measures; the drives obtained can also guide clinical practice to establish treatment objectives with patients with fibromyalgia collaboratively."
What Determines Senior Post-Career Entrepreneurship: An Exploration From Individual and Environmental Perspectives,"['Liu, Yue']","['Boënne, Mathias']",2022-08-09T00:02:19Z,EN,['senior post-career; entrepreneurship; individual and environmental determinants; country-specific; qualitative'],Business Development and Entrepreneurship,"Many efforts to deal with the active aging population have been attempted in various countries, both academically and practically. However, how to help the elderly with sufficient time and accumulated skills to engage in entrepreneurial ventures is an underexploited and neglected area. In this way, if we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence the participation of this group in entrepreneurial activities, we can not only continue to improve the research on the entrepreneurial system of older people from a theoretical point of view but also effectively pool more resources in society to help improve the entrepreneurial performance. At this point, the central research question of this paper is what the individual and environmental determinants of senior post-career entrepreneurship (SPE) are in China. To respond to this question, this paper focuses on Jiangsu Province, China, and examines the determinants of SPE in a specific environmental context using a qualitative method with data from archival research plus 10 semi-structured in-depth interviews on the development of SPE in the region. In the end, we find that starting from the end of occupational maturity and the self-discovery of opportunities and the self-perception of being at the threshold of pre-work stress (self-perception) up to the limit of average life expectancy for any health-permitting range of conditions, should be a relatively scientific range for SPE research. Furthermore, age and former career, when viewed separately, have different implications for entrepreneurial decisions. Age tends not to have a direct impact on entrepreneurial behavior unless it is linked to factors such as health, whereas a former career has a very direct impact on entrepreneurial motivation, but not always in the same direction in different situations. At the same time, these two factors act as a joint label and are an important marker of the life stage. Personality traits and self-need satisfaction can influence the decision to SPE on a psychological level, while considerations of opportunity costs and contextual factors such as education and professionalism can have an impact on SPE on a non-psychological level. It must not be overlooked that macroeconomic trends and social policy orientations, as well as socio-cultural systems, are the most influential factors in the external environment for SPE"

Eat Your Cake and Have It Too? The Effect of the Minimum Wage on Employment and Family Income as Evidenced by Germany’s Federal Minimum Wage Implementation,"['Baarda, Rado']","['Rademakers, Emilie']",2022-08-09T00:02:15Z,EN,['Minimum Wage; Employment; Family Income; Continuous Difference-in-Difference; Germany'],Law and Economics,"This paper analyzes the short-run effects of the minimum wage on employment and the family income distribution, in line with the first two questions posed by Stigler (1946). For this purpose, the thesis examined Germany’s recent implementation of a national minimum wage, expanding upon Caliendo et al. (2018). Regional variation in the policy’s bite—as well as the presence of a common trend in state employment levels, bite statistics, and the mean family income earned by the bottom 50% of the income distribution—led this study to follow Card’s (1992) and conduct a continuous difference-in-difference regression. Based on this paper’s regression results, the minimum wage appears to have a small and statistically significant negative effect on the level of overall employment. Furthermore, when separately analyzing the policy’s effect on regular and marginal employment, the findings indicate that the minimum wage has a larger negative effect on the latter category. Finally, this study’s estimates do not provide evidence that the implementation of Germany’s minimum wage led to the increase in family incomes along the lower half of the income distribution. Instead, there is some statistically significant evidence that the policy had a negative effect on the incomes earned by families located in the bottom 10 percent of the distribution. Based on these findings it appears that the minimum wage as a policy is not an effective tool to raise low-income families out of poverty."

Determinants of Serial Acquisition Performance in the Asset Management Industry,"['Andrews, Daphne']","['Valboni, Riccardo']",2022-08-09T00:02:22Z,EN,['asset management; acquisition program; consolidation; serial acquisition'],International Management,"The focus of this research is to gain insight into the fluctuation of acquisition activity amongst asset management firms leading to industry consolidation. Firms are acquiring more competitors in a shorter span of time which exhibits the characteristics of serial acquirers. Some firms experience more long-term success with this strategy than others. While previous literature exists on acquisition programs and post-acquisition performance, none delve into the nuances of asset management that could improve post-acquisition performance in the industry. Based on extensive analysis of literature and industry expertise, I introduce an empirically founded framework of determinants for serial acquisition performance in the industry. At the foundation, this study examines determinants from a similar industry, banking, and presents determinants specific to asset management, i.e., the development of financial advisors and the incorporation of ETFs into product offerings. Focusing on human capital and product diversity resulted in an improvement of post-acquisition financial performance. Asset management firms may consider including these components into acquisition programs in the future."

changing as the number of female CEOs and female board members has been increasing. In addition,
there has been higher social and institutional pressure for change. Therefore, it is important to know
what effect a higher share of women in top positions can have on corporate behavior. This study focuses
on corporate behavior during the M&A process, as M&A is one of the biggest decisions a firm can
make. Most existing literature on the M&A process focuses on the effects of firm and market
characteristics. The goal of this study, however, is to add to the literature on the effects of gender
characteristics, by investigating gender differences in risk taking during the M&A process. In addition,
the role of board gender diversity is investigated. This study empirically analyzes a sample of 870 deals
done by S&P 500 firms in the period 2015-2019. The results indicate that gender differences are
apparent in the choice of payment (cash vs. stock) as well as for the choice of target type (private vs.
public). In addition, this study investigates whether board gender diversity moderates these gender
differences. The results are more unclear, as only for the choice of target type a significant moderating
effect was found. The results of this study therefore strengthen existing evidence on gender differences
in corporate behavior, especially during the M&A process and can therefore serve as arguments for more
gender quotas. Moreover, it adds to the existing literature by investigating the moderating role of board
gender diversity, on which literature is relatively scarce."

In order to fill this gap, this research has, for the first time, applied the viability of Upper Echelons Theory to Interim Management.
The literature offers clear similarities and appears to point into the direction of an applicability of Upper Echelons Theory to Interim Management. In order to investigate, 4 characteristics from Upper Echelons Theory were identified and researched: Experience in the Field, International Experience, Tenure and Age.
Data from the context of football was gathered and analysed (n=136). Based on the results, appointing an interim manager had a clear, positive, significant effect on Performance. None of the interim manager characteristics however were significant in predicting Performance. 
We conclude that the appointment of an interim manager has a positive effect on Performance, but this is not due to individual characteristics. These results negate the viability of Upper Echelons Theory on Interim Management. Interim Management appears to be too different to be encapsulated by the template of Upper Echelons Theory."
Explainability of Transformers for Authorship Attribution,"['Kondyurin, Ivan']","['Paperno, Denis']",2022-08-11T00:00:49Z,EN,['Authorship attribution; stylometry; transformers; BERT; attention; LIME'],Artificial Intelligence,"Authorship attribution attempts to establish the author of a particular text. In this work, we examine the capabilities of transformer-based models in the subtype of attribution task referred to as authorship verification, which involves determining whether the texts are created by the same author. A few works have been suggested that applied fine-tuned Transformer models in this field. Such approach is motivated by their excellent performance and adaptability (fine-tuning can be performed on texts of different sizes and genres, and different pre-trained model checkpoints enable switching between languages). However, they are not as transparent as the traditional methods, in which features that quantify the style (stylometric features) are selected to maximize the distance between texts. To tackle this problem, we first implement a model for authorship verification based on BERT architecture and then investigate the way its predictions are made by applying an adapted LIME explainer and proposing an attention-based relevant feature extracting procedure. We then compare the two approaches and analyze their explainability from the causal perspective by input ablation and alteration to verify that they can retrieve the features that have a strong influence on the model predictions. We also describe and classify the extracted features from a linguistic perspective."

The Relational Self,"['Makkus, Merel']","['Górska, Magdalena']",2022-08-11T00:00:57Z,EN,[],Gender Studies (Research),"This thesis focusses on a relational understanding of the self by asking how the self is 
relationally constituted through others and the natural environment. This question is addressed 
by visually analysing Ettinger’s “Rachel – Pieta – Medusa 3” (Ettinger 2018c) and Mendieta’s 
“Imágen de Yágul” (Mendieta 1973). The research question that this thesis aims to answer is: 
how do Ettinger’s painting on family relations and Mendieta’s photograph on natural relations 
address relational understandings of the self through vulnerability and entanglement of the 
self with others and the world? By putting these artworks in conversation with each other and 
contemporary theory on relationality, this thesis approaches relationality through the 
entanglement of the self with others as well as through the entanglement of the self with 
nature. Through visual analysis of the artworks and an agential realist approach, this thesis
reads the materials through each other rather than against each other. First, this thesis analyses
Ettinger’s “Rachel – Pieta – Medusa 3” (Ettinger 2018c) to address relationality through 
family relations and the self as relational with the other. Second, this thesis analyses
Mendieta’s “Imágen de Yágul” (Mendieta 1973) to address relationality through nature and 
the self as relational with natural surroundings. Finally, this thesis addresses how notions of 
self and vulnerability feature in both artworks and how the artworks bring up notions of self 
and vulnerability differently to consider the self as vulnerable. This thesis works towards 
understanding the self as intra-actively co-constituted through the blurring of boundaries 
while simultaneously addressing relational differentiality through the articulations of 
boundaries in both artworks. A relational understanding of the self challenges western 
individualistic notions of self that consider the self as separable from others which has 
resulted in the unequal distribution of vulnerability and safety, and as superior to nature which 
has resulted in environmental devastation. Understanding the self as relational is important to 
consider the self an active agency with ethical responsibility to care for others and the natural 
environment."

This study researches in what way long-term usage of a DVA affects trust and roles of the user and associated household. The assumption is that DVAs impact trust and roles within a household from the user toward the DVA, but also from the user toward other household members. Using a multi-methods approach, two experiments are performed to measure to what extent the DVA has an impact on the social system. Specifically, it is tested to what extent the social systems are impacted by the DVA on the level of trust and roles (experiment 1) and on the level of relationships within the household (experiment 2). During the first experiment, the roles and level of trust are examined with dilemma tasks where participants (n = 75) are asked to order their household members and DVA from who they would approach first to last. These dilemmas were categorized between different domains
(knowledge, social, domestic, entertaining). Afterwards, participants were asked to rate their trust in the answers from the others. Results from a mixed effect repeated measures ANOVA showed that the level of trust and the roles are influenced by an interaction of agent and domain. The level of trust is also dependent on the order in which the agent is placed, with the agent being chosen first if the level of trust is high. In the second experiment, the impact of the DVA on households, relationships, trust, and roles was analysed more in-depth. Participants (n = 14) were interviewed about their DVA and their household. The results found no change in trust from the impact of the DVA. An effect on roles and relationships within the household was found, especially within the group that owned the DVA for longer, which indicated that changes in roles and relationships can come over time. Together, these results suggest that the DVA does not impact inter-relational trust, but does affect the roles of the user and associated household. The findings point to an effect that develops over time."
Influencing Postauricular Reflex Magnitude Using Reward in a Motivational Task,"['Coordes, Maren']","['Terburg, David']",2022-08-11T00:00:52Z,EN,['post-auricular; reflex; reward and loss; motivation and arousal'],Neuropsychology,"This study investigates the magnitude of the post-auricular muscle reflex (PAMR) in response to feedback about low and high rewards in order to determine whether the reflex could be used as an implicit measure of individual reward perception. 
The PAMR was elicited by administering rapid click sounds and recorded with an electromyograph. Meanwhile, participants (N = 32) had to complete a reaction time task in which they could either increase, maintain or decrease their score. Obtaining a higher score would lead to a higher monetary reward. The rewards and losses were each divided into a high and a low level. We found that feedback about a loss and reward elicits a significantly stronger PAMR magnitude than neutral feedback, indicating that the reflex reacted to mutual properties of reward and loss stimuli. It was further found that gaining high rewards affects the PAMR more strongly than gaining low rewards. 
The study proposes that reward and loss are similar in motivation and arousal properties, which could be the underlying factors influencing the PAMR magnitude. Derived from that, higher motivation and arousal could lead to increases in PAMR magnitude."
"Birth Order and Adolescent Alcohol Use:
The mediating role of Quality of Parent-Adolescent Relationship and Parental Monitoring","['Jessica Ann Raj, Jessica']","['Dubas, Judith']",2022-08-11T00:00:54Z,EN,[],Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"Lately, a risky behavior that has been of concern in the Netherlands is alcohol intoxication in adolescents. Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between birth order and risky behavior, however, there are but a few studies that looked specifically into the association between birth order and adolescent alcohol use. Moreover, the possible factors explaining this relationship are still mostly unknown. This study examined the relationship between birth order and adolescent alcohol use taking into account the mediating roles of  parent-adolescent relationship quality (support and conflict) and parental monitoring. A total of 3450 participants were drawn from a larger 3-wave study called “The Adolescent Risk-Taking (ART) Project” from various schools in the Netherlands. Results indicated that there was no relationship between birth order and adolescent alcohol use. Moreover, birth order was not associated with parental factors. Nonetheless, parent-adolescent conflict and parental monitoring were significantly predictive of alcohol use."

The current pilot study aimed to shed light into the causal links between these constructs, in a sample of twenty-nine (N= 29) females clinically diagnosed with AN. It was firstly examined if IU can be manipulated in AN, by inducing high or low levels of IU, with the use of short stories and visual analogue scale (VAS) questions. Following the IU manipulation, it was explored if IU predicts anxiety. Findings showed no differences between the high-IU and low-IU groups after the induction of IU, revealing the IU manipulation was not successful, and therefore disconfirming our second hypothesis. Limitations, suggestions for future research and clinical implications are also included in the present paper."
Generalized Global Symmetries and the Swampland,"['Vuren, Thomas van']","['Grimm, Thomas']",2022-08-11T00:00:56Z,EN,['String Theory; Type IIB; Calabi-Yau; Compactification; Generalized Global Symmetries; Asymptotic Hodge Theory;'],Theoretical Physics,"The recent discovery of a large class of generalized global symmetries has significantly impacted our understanding of many phenomena in quantum field theory, ranging from anomalies to confinement with applications to both low- and high-energy physics. It is widely
believed however, that exact global symmetries are forbidden in consistent theories of quantum gravity. By studying how generalized global symmetries are avoided in string theory, we
may discover mechanisms which turn out to be general features of quantum gravity.
In this thesis we will follow this approach and apply it to a large class of effective field
theories obtained from Calabi-Yau compactification of type IIB string theory. After a review
of these effective theories, we give an accessible introduction to generalized global symmetries
with a focus on their role in the swampland program. Using asymptotic Hodge theory we
then extract the most general limiting form of the action near boundaries in the complex
structure moduli space. With these in hand, we enumerate the global symmetries that may
emerge in these limits and explore how they are broken by stringy effects."

So-called seed grant programs fund young women to design and implement grassroot, community-based sports projects. After exploring the presence – and absence – of seed grant programs in research and practice, postcolonial and intersectional feminist theory as well as the philosophy of servant leadership build the theoretical framework of this research. This paper presents findings from a small-scale, qualitative study of two European seed grant programs: ROLL Models and the adidas Breaking Barriers project. To mitigate the traditional power imbalance between researcher and subject and to follow a decolonized approach, this thesis puts the experiences of the champions, i.e. the young women who receive the seed grant, at the center of analysis and investigates the following question: Based on champions’ shared experiences, how are seed grant programs contributing to more gender equitable and inclusive spaces in sports and beyond? Through thematic analysis, the following themes resulted as the main contributing aspects: (1) a network of learners and leaders, (2) the feeling of empowerment and confidence, (3) the incentive to act as gender champions, shedding light and challenging outdated norms as well as (4) the principles of servant leadership. The paper concludes by positioning seed grant programs in the broader discussion on decolonizing the playing field and offers recommendations for both research and practice."

Exploring the Drivers and Barriers to the Adoption and Implementation of Reusable Medical Devices,"['Gunnink, Frank']","['Moors, Ellen']",2022-08-16T00:01:00Z,EN,[],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Introduction
Disposable medical devices contribute substantially to the environmental impact of Dutch hospitals.
The use of reusable medical devices in cataract surgery could contribute to lowering this impact and
advancing the transition towards circular hospitals. One of the medical devices currently used in
cataract surgery is a disposable cartridge, but it is also possible to use a day-cartridge that is reused for
multiple surgeries. However, there are still complexities to the adoption and implementation of the
day-cartridge in the Dutch hospitals, which were identified in this research.
Theory
The framework to study the Nonadoption, Abandonment, and challenges to Scaleup, Spread and
Sustainability (NASSS) of innovations in healthcare was used to identify drivers and barriers to the
adoption and implementation of the day-cartridge in Dutch hospitals. This framework was
complemented with system functions of the Mission-oriented Innovation Systems (MIS) approach to
put the day-cartridge into the context of the transition towards circular hospitals.
Methodology
A case study design focusing on the potential implementation of the day-cartridge in University
Medical Center Utrecht and other Dutch hospitals was used. Data was collected through desk research
and 30 interviews within seven stakeholder groups: ophthalmologists, nurses, procurement,
sustainability managers, patient groups, infection prevention experts and the day-cartridge’s supplier.
Results
The most important drivers for adopting and implementing the day-cartridge are its time-saving and
waste reduction potential. Barriers identified include the adopter’s concerns of cross-contamination
by the day-cartridge. Adopters require additional proof that the day-cartridge is safe before they are
willing to use it. Additionally, safe use of the day-cartridge is more dependent on correct usage
compared to using a disposable cartridge. Furthermore, circularity plays a limited role when hospitals
procure medical devices, which forms a barrier to the implementation of the day-cartridge. There is a
lack of knowledge among stakeholders regarding the effects of infection prevention measures and the
environmental impact of medical devices, which impedes the adoption of the day-cartridge and other
circular solutions. In addition, there is insufficient direction in the transition towards circular hospitals
for stakeholders to adopt and implement circular solutions, like the day-cartridge.
Conclusion & discussion
The novel approach of combining the NASSS framework with the MIS approach provides a unique
insight into how the transition towards circular hospitals impacts the adoption and implementation of
the day-cartridge. Placing the day-cartridge into the context of the mission for circular hospitals allows
for identifying the dynamics between this transition and the day-cartridge."
Science & Practice : the case study of coral reef conservation & sewage pollution in Curaçao,"['Leiser, Elise']","['Laerhoven, Frank van']",2022-08-16T00:01:04Z,EN,"['Research uptake, Curaçao, corals, sewage']",Sustainable Development,"Much research is being conducted on environmental issues but more knowledge does not necessarily lead to more decisions that take into account such knowledge. A low research uptake can therefore be a threat to ecosystems. An example is research going on about coral reefs and pollution in Curaçao. Coral reefs are vibrant ecosystems and provide many services. They support the economy and protect the coasts. However, they are declining as many hazards threaten them such as sewage that pours out into the sea. Scientific research is being conducted on that topic, but a major issue is the insufficient uptake of research by the policy sphere and the civil society to adopt environmental friendly decisions and behaviours. This master thesis is embedded in the SEALINK project, which aims at understanding how pollution such as sewage impacts the coral reef in Curaçao, and more precisely to its work package on research uptake strategies. This thesis first identifies in the literature the conditions under which research uptake is optimal. Literature highlights three criteria that knowledge should meet in order to have  an  optimal  research  uptake:  legitimacy,  credibility  and  salience.  The  salience  of  the scientific knowledge produced on sewage pollution and its impact on the reef is the focus of this thesis as the legitimacy and credibility of the knowledge produced on sewage are assumed to be met already. Salience refers to the relevance of the knowledge produced for the users of science, such as policy makers. A lack of salience can be the cause of differences in timerames, in  the  vocabulary used  between the  scientist and  users of  knowledge,  for instance.  The stakeholders  that  affect  sewage  in  Curaçao,  such  as  the  ministry  in  charge  of  sewage management, companies that pick up sewage, the tourism industry, or fishermen, were then listed to  be  interviewed.  Interviews  of these  stakeholders  were conducted  to  explore the behaviours undermining salience of the knowledge produced on the topic at hand. The results show that this knowledge lacks salience because of an operational misfit between the demand for, and supply of knowledge. Recommendations to the local actors and to future researchers on solutions to create more salient knowledge and therefore to have optimal research uptake to protect  the  reef  better,  are  proposed  under  the  form  of  science-policy  interfaces  with  an emphasis  on  knowledge  co-production  as  the main  approach  to  improve  the  science  and practice relationship"

Stichting Vreedzaam heeft waargenomen dat leerlingen zich op school goed houden aan Vreedzame waarden, maar dat dat na schooltijd, op straat vervaagt. Dit is onderzocht aan de hand van een kwalitatief photovoice onderzoek en semigestructureerde focusgroepen met kinderen uit groep 6/7 op een basisschool in Overvecht (N=14). De resultaten laten zien dat de Vreedzame cultuur wordt gezien als blijheid, natuur en positieve omgang met elkaar. Straatcultuur wordt gezien als een gewelddadige en vervuilende omgeving. De participanten passen Vreedzame waarden niet altijd toe in conflicten, maar vermijden deze of komen voor zichzelf op. De participanten ervaren niet zozeer dat er meerdere versies van zichzelf zijn, maar voelen zich wel vrijer buiten school. Concluderend, leerlingen zien de Vreedzame cultuur als iets positiefs en straatcultuur als iets negatiefs. Het toepassen van de Vreedzame cultuur naar straatcultuur kunnen zijn ingewikkeld vinden, dit kan te maken hebben met een gevoel van onveiligheid op straat. Doordat kinderen zich anders moeten gedragen in beide contexten kan het ook zijn dat zij van identiteit moeten schakelen. Stichting Vreedzaam word aanbevolen om school meer de wijk in te brengen, leerlingen positieve ervaringen met Vreedzame waarden in de wijk op te laten doen, te werken aan veiligheid, kinderen serieus te nemen en om bewust te worden van meerdere identiteiten van leerlingen."

"A greenhouse gas footprint and economic assessment of importing renewable H2 from Portugal to the Netherlands, using liquid organic hydrogen carriers","['Nunes Godinho, João']","['Hoefnagels, Ric']",2022-09-08T23:00:30Z,EN,['LOHC;toluene;dibenzyltoluene;supply chain;green H2'],Energy Science,"This research was conducted to quantify the economic and GHG impact of importing green H2 from Sines, Portugal, to Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. The H2 to be transported was stored within two-way LOHCs – specifically, the toluene-methylcyclohexane (TOL-MCH) and the dibenzyltoluene-perhydro-dibenzyltoluene (DBT-PDBT) systems – and the transportation was assumed to be handled by chemical/oil tankers. H2 has been highly regarded as one of the most important energy carriers of the coming decades (Detz et al., 2019; European Commission, 2018, 2020a), and is projected to have a substantial contribution towards mitigating the inherent intermittence in energy production via RES. This is a crucial step to achieve decarbonization goals of several industries, such as the feedstock industry, process heating, build environment, transportation, etc. (Port of Rotterdam, 2020). This research was further motivated by the bilateral agreement between the Portuguese and Dutch governments to establish a supply chain of green H2 (2020). Moreover, this research complements the study conducted by Carvalho (2021), which optimized the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes of the mentioned LOHC systems, for an annual delivery of 50 kt of H2. The necessary data to compute the results was gathered through literature review and interviews with experts from the respective fields. Overall, the results were assessed based on the impact of completing one roundtrip between Sines and Rotterdam, for the years 2030, 2040 and 2050. Following, these values were extrapolated to match the yearly requirements. The findings from this study concluded that transporting DBT-PDBT, while using small tankers – with a capacity of 27,300 DWT – is the most financially viable option. Accordingly, the results attested that transporting H2 stored in DBT from Sines to Rotterdam, would increment the supply chain in 0.30 €/kg-H2 in 2030, increasing to 0.34 €/kg-H2 in 2040, and finally to 0.38 €/kg-H2 in 2050. When added to the costs concerning the production of H2 and the LOHC conversion processes, a total supply chain cost of 4.28 €/kg-H2 can be expected, for 2030. For 2040, this value is slightly lower, at 4.16 €/kg-H2, and for 2050, it is projected to reach roughly 3.17 €/kg-H2. The respective GHG impact was projected to be 2.471 kg-CO2/GJ-H2 (LHV) in 2030 decreasing to 1.309 kg-CO2/GJ-H2 (LHV) in 2040, and 0.461 kg-CO2/GJ-H2 (LHV) in 2050. Comparing with conventional steam methane reforming, the projected LOHC supply chain allows for savings of 96.0% in 2030, increasing to 99.0% in 2050."

The use of fall risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs) often plays a role in the risk of a fall. Therefore, community pharmacies are a good setting for fall prevention services. In view of digitization and corona, it is desirable to have a fall consultation carried out by telephone. 
Method: This qualitative study aims to gain insight into patient experiences over a fall prevention service by telephone in Dutch community pharmacies. Inclusion criteria were: Age ≥70 years, community-dwelling, using at least five drugs and one FRID and being able to speak Dutch. Patients were registered in one of three community pharmacies in the Netherlands. Data were collected between February and May 2021, and interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. 
Results: Evaluation interviews were conducted with 34 patients. Patients appreciated interpersonal involvement between the patient and the pharmacy team, knowledge, and efficiency of the pharmacy team. No patients started doing something practically different after the fall consultation. Patients generally liked that their medication was reviewed. The telephone aspect was of little influence on patient experience.  
Discussion/conclusion: In general, patients were positive about the fall prevention service. Despite this, the findings reveal that virtually all patients had trouble remembering what they were advised. This leads to believe that the role of the community pharmacist in an effective, multifaceted fall prevention service needs to be further investigated."

Background: Patients with an impaired renal function have an increased risk of developing AKI. This 
is more likely to happen when patients are at risk of dehydration, so called sick days, in combination 
with medication such as diuretics. That is why it is important to prevent this combination. Good 
collaboration between healthcare professionals could be one way to improve this. 
Aim: To investigate what healthcare providers need to improve their collaboration to manage the use of 
medication for patients with an impaired renal function during sick days.
Method: Pharmacists, GPs and hospital-based physicians have participated in semi-structured 
interviews. The interview guide covered the following main topics: the errors surrounding the use of 
medication, the collaboration between the different healthcare providers, sick days,training 
requirements for the healthcare providers, and the provision of information to the patients. The 
interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Then the analysis was carried out using NVivo 
version 1.5.1. 
Results: The following main topics emerged from the results: communication, protocols and 
guidelines and requirements to optimize collaboration. On the one hand, the laboratory values were 
increasingly communicated between healthcare providers in the past few years. On the other hand, 
there was no communication about patients having a sick day. Also, there are currently no real 
guidelines that support the collaboration to manage the use of medication in patients with an 
impaired renal function during sick days. According to the caregivers, a guideline and improved care 
systems are needed in order to improve collaboration to prevent AKI.
Conclusion: There are guidelines for the use of medication in patients with an impaired renal
function. Agreements will have to be made in order to comply with these guidelines. In addition, a 
coordinated computer system could help to improve the collaboration during sick days."

enhances inclusion of all stakeholders involved. Moral case deliberation (MCD) could provide
us with a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in global health to improve their moral
competence through inclusive way of exchanging and understanding perspectives. However,
to our knowledge, there is no evidence of the use of MCD for educational purposes in global
health. This study aims to investigate how moral case deliberation can be used to educate
healthcare professionals in global health using a mixed-methods study design. No proof was
found for an existing method for moral case deliberation in the literature searched. The first
version of a method was developed based on the Utrecht Method by combining insights from
literature on enhancing inclusion in global health ethics, expert experiences and observations,
and the Humanitarian Health Analysis Tool. This version was tested and adjusted according
to observations made during test sessions, feedback from participants, and expert opinions.
This resulted in an adjusted Utrecht Method, consisting of thirteen consecutive steps to be
used in moral case deliberations in global health education, with a focus on inclusion. In the
future, we recommend this method should be further tested, adjusted, and evaluated."

For the analysis of music, many formal frameworks of analysis exist, but most of these are focused on the analysis of classical or art music. No such framework exists for the analysis of popular electronic music. This can be attributed to a few causes, such as the lack of a unified notation system, the relative newness of electronic music and its relatively peripheral status in relation to classical or art music, as far as the academy and conservatory are concerned. 
Synthesizers, as well as mixing and mastering tools give the DAW an unparalleled ability to manipulate the ways in which we perceive sound, from imposing a sense of spatiality through stereo to manipulating perception of timbre and loudness. Therefore, I propose a framework of electronic music analysis based on the terminology of music production, sound design and psychoacoustics. In this way, an accurate set of terms to describe what is happening in electronic music can be compiled.
For this thesis, I will examine current musical works composed with DAW’s and its workflow. In lieu of easily accessible notation I will employ tools like Sonic visualizer to extract information from music by way of spectography, as well as focused listening skills acquired from specialized training. With these tools I hope to create a concrete framework that can aid future research into electronic music."

In total, 51 participants (Mage = 21.95, SDage = 1.99) took part in this study; 17 had a 10-minute walk, 34 had a 25-minute walk. Mood was measured using the PANAS, given to participants once before and once after the nature walk. Weather was included as a confounder variable. Using a 2 (pre- versus post-PANAS score) x 2 (positive versus negative mood) between-subjects design, a repeated measures MANOVA was carried out. The results showed that positive mood increased after walking in nature while negative mood decreased. No significant moderation effect of exposure duration was found. A 10-minute walk in nature was as effective on mood as a 25-minute walk. Weather did not confound the relationship between nature exposure and mood. This study extends other research measuring the restorative effects of nature on mood, which is important for individuals’ emotional wellbeing. Due to the clear positive impacts on mood, the results suggest that individuals ought to be encouraged to spend time in nature for at least 10 minutes in order to heighten positive and lessen negative mood."

But ultimately focusing on what it was that caused they eventual disappearance. In doing so it reveals how one particular Help bank in Haarlem was able to remain relevant up into the mid twentieth century and remain in business for another thirty years after World War Two had ended.
Through careful reconstruction of the institute’s financial health and credit distribution this study shows the flexibility of Help banks to continue serving their customers by making many small but meaningful changes to their business formulas. Some of which reveal interesting new avenues for microcredit research and reaching greater financial inclusivity.
A study of an institution at the microlevel also points to the value of digging deeper into the social networks that makeup institutions like these. Especially with institutions birthed by particular social ideals like the Help bank, as the extensive quantitative data and information from the business side still leaves some important questions unanswered with regards to the creativeness these institutions display in adapting to their changing circumstances."

Om deze toegang tot krediet voor kleine ondernemers te versterken ontstonden in Nederland hulpinstanties waarbij kredieten tegen gunstige voorwaarden verleend werden en waarbij de Nederlandse staat optrad als borg. Ondanks dat deze borgstellingsfondsen succesvol bleken, brak in de jaren zeventig van de vorige eeuw een periode aan waarin deze fondsen volledig verdwenen. Veel van deze borgstellingsfondsen gingen over in nieuw opgerichte stichtingen, de zogenaamde Regionale Dienstverleningscentra Kleinbedrijf. Nederland vertoonde in dit opzicht een unieke discontinuïteit ten opzichte van omringende Europese landen. Deze scriptie heeft om deze reden onderzoek gedaan naar deze transitie en het verdwijnen van de borgstellingsfondsen. Het Stichtse Borgstellingsfonds te Utrecht maakte hierbij eenzelfde transitie door. Door de goed gedocumenteerde stukken van dit borgstellingsfonds is de Utrechtse casus uitvoerig bestudeerd en geanalyseerd. Hieruit blijkt dat voor de Utrechtse MKB-ondernemer het verkrijgen van een krediet vaak onlosmakelijk verbonden was aan het krijgen van advies. Hierbij ontstond na verloop van tijd een situatie waarbij kredieten van het borgstellingsfonds niet meer nodig waren, maar de vraag naar advies bleef. Deze scriptie betoogd dat de transitie voort is gekomen uit een proces, waarbij de borgstellingsfondsen zelf in de grote zee van de Nederlandse politieke economie overeind probeerden te blijven en kost wat kost de belangen van ondernemers wilden behartigen."
NATO's Article 5: Performative or Practical?,"['Honné, Yannick']","['Ozavci, Ozan']",2022-09-09T00:01:09Z,EN,[],International Relations in Historical Perspective,"The purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) has appeared anything but indisputable since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. While some scholars have argued that the Alliance needs to adapt to fit current global security issues, others have stated that it has become increasingly redundant. This thesis contributes to this discussion by revealing new perspectives on how Article 5 influences NATO’s relevance. So far, the legal clause behind ‘an attack against one is an attack against all’ has only been invoked after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 against the United States. The recent series of Islamic terrorist attacks in Europe since 2015 has not led to the same decision, despite their similarities. By using Securitisation Theory, this research compares the securitisation process after 9/11 to that of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris to identify four reasons that explain why this is the case for France. Based on the arguments brought forward, it can be concluded that Article 5 has predominantly been used as a performative symbol of deterrence rather than a practical device."
Spatialising International Relations: Polish Mental Mapping and the Image of Germany (1848-1871),"['Dargiewicz, Adam']","['Pekelder, J.']",2022-09-09T00:01:10Z,EN,"['Polish-German relations; mental mapping; ""the West""; ""the East""; mental mapping; public opinion; constructivism; historical semantics']",History,"This thesis investigates how spatial representations such as “the West” and “the East” shaped the Polish view of Germany between 1848 and 1871.  These spatial terms gained a profound political and normative appeal as they served to draw civilisational lines between European states and the rest of the world as well as within Europe. The main argument of this thesis entails that depending on the conditions of European international relations Germany could be portrayed as “Eastern”, “backward”, and “divided” or, at other times, it was conceptualised as a “model nation-state”, “industrious” and “culturally advanced” nation. This was a mental map which helped the Polish elites navigate through uneasy waters of the nineteenth century diplomacy, revolutions and frame relationships with neighbours, most notably Germany. By combining the theories of public opinion and mental mapping, the proposed approach traces the ways in which non-state actors formulated their systemic views on international relations and strived to exercise agency through the deployment of carefully crafted discursive tools. The application of historical semantics to written contributions of the Polish public (political pamphlets and newspaper articles) enables to capture the constructed nature of “the West” and “the East”, their fluctuating and deeply contextual meaning as well as their political functionality."
Framing the implementation of data governance platforms,"['Wildt, Iris de']","['Brand, Nico']",2022-09-09T00:01:08Z,EN,['data governance platforms; contingency theory; framework design; change implementation'],Business Informatics,"Data governance ensures high data availability, quality and security of data by specifying the decision rights and accountabilities for data. However, a data governance implementation is an extremely complex undertaking as many organizational areas are involved and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Something that can help improve the data governance at an organization is introducing a data governance platform that automates data governance activities, as this can ensure better availability, consistency and scalability. In order to maximize the benefits a data governance platform can provide, it is important that the organization is mature enough in its data governance and that the implementation is tailored to the organization’s specific situation. This research aims to design a framework that supports an organization in implementing a data governance platform by considering the situational factors of the organization, according to the contingency theory which considers that the most effective strategy to implement a system depends on the organization’s environment. To design the framework, the research was executed in three phases. Firstly, during the problem investigation phase, current literature of data governance and change implementation was examined. Additionally, subject matter experts on the topic of data governance platform implementations were interviewed about their experience with such a project. Secondly, during the treatment design phase, the success factors and situational factors for the implementation of a data governance platform were derived from the literature and expert interviews. This resulted in two visual frameworks which can be used complementary, with one framework focussing on the process of implementation and the other focussing on picking an implementation strategy. Thirdly, in the treatment validation phase, the frameworks were validated by means of interviews. On the one hand, this took the form of case study in which practitioners from case study organizations were questioned. On the other hand, academics who had affinity with data governance were interviewed. From this, it could be concluded that the frameworks can be used as a communication tool and for deciding how and when to implement a data governance platform. This can give an organization more guidance during the implementation process and contributes to the current body of knowledge on the implementation of data governance platforms."

The secondary aim of this research was to explore the institutional factors that affect the development of RECs. A regression analysis was performed to investigate the influence of social capital on the founding rate of RECs. Additionally, interviews were conducted with board members from RECs to further investigate the role of social capital and to explore institutional factors influencing the development of RECs. The results showed a positive relationship between the founding rate of RECs and the level of social capital present in municipalities. Furthermore, a variety of  institutional factors played an important role in the development of RECs in the Netherlands. National and local governments can use the drivers and tackle the barriers explored in this research to implement appropriate policy. Governmental bodies can play a key role in supporting the development of RECs both organizationally and financially. This would contribute to the energy transition and the goal of 50 percent local ownership over energy sources. Future research should focus on the scaling of renewable energy cooperatives and other cooperative initiatives to stimulate local involvement and bottom-up solutions."

Sounds of Solidarity: Music in the 1984–85 Miners’ Strike,"['Kok, Moira de']","['Ahrendt, Rebekah']",2022-09-09T00:02:37Z,EN,"[""solidarity; social movements; political music; 1984-85 miners' strike; popular music; British history""]",Musicology,"Scholars, activists, and musicians often attribute powers of solidarity to music. However, they rarely explain what ‘solidarity’ means, and how music may generate, sustain, strengthen, or express it. This thesis therefore investigates how solidarity as a political concept intertwines with musical practices. I develop a model with four prongs: ontology, sociality, mobilisation, and intentionality. Each explores a different facet of solidarity as a relation between people that centres a sense of togetherness and support.
To delimit this research, I focus on popular music during the 1984–85 UK miners’ strike. Although many musicians passionately supported the strike, their work to support the miners has not yet received thorough musicological investigation. Moreover, the strike was a moment of crisis in a period characterised by polarisation not dissimilar to the 2020s. The strike thus emerges as a relevant moment for the study of music and solidarity. I apply my model to four case studies, all of which have been linked to solidarity by the musicians or activists involved. The case studies comprise two benefit concerts, Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners’ Pits and Perverts concert and Billy Bragg’s tour across the UK, and two benefit records, Test Dept’s Shoulder to Shoulder and the Council Collective’s ‘Soul Deep’. Using discourse analysis, musical analysis, and philosophical inquiry, I examine how musicians and activists mobilised the word ‘solidarity’ when discussing music, what this music sounded like, and what these discourses and sounds uncover about perceptions of solidarity and music’s connection to politics.
I argue that ‘solidarity’ is a multivalent and underdefined, yet rhetorically powerful word. It is therefore perfectly suited to imbue popular music with political meaning and agency, particularly during moments of crisis. In turn, popular music is perceived as a medium that can rescue solidarity from extinction, co-construct its meaning, and broadcast this meaning to the people. Musicological analysis can therefore reveal underlying assumptions about solidarity, including its fundamental processes of in- and exclusion. Inquiry into the 1984–85 strike as a musical and political moment provides new insights on conceptions of solidarity and the place of music in social movements."

Binnen bestuurskundig onderzoek is weinig onderzoek gedaan naar monarchieën en waarom inwoners deze wel of niet steunen. Dit verkennende onderzoek is geïnspireerd door een beweging die zichtbaar is in enquêtes over de monarchie, namelijk dat jongeren de monarchie minder steunen dan ouderen (Ipsos, 2022). In het onderzoek worden de motivaties voor het wel of niet steunen van de monarchie van generatie Z en de babyboomgeneratie met elkaar vergeleken aan de hand van de vraag: Op welke manier verschillen generatie Z en de babyboomgeneratie qua steun voor de Nederlandse monarchie? Om een antwoord op deze vraag te geven is zowel literatuur- als empirisch onderzoek uitgevoerd. 

Literatuuronderzoek is uitgevoerd om uiteen te zetten wat invloed zou kunnen hebben op het wel of niet steunen van een monarchie. Daarnaast is gekeken op welke manier vanuit wetenschappelijke literatuur generatieverschillen verklaard worden. Beide perspectieven zijn samengebracht en hebben geleid tot theoretische verwachtingen. Met deze theoretische verwachtingen in het achterhoofd zijn 46 respondenten geïnterviewd over hun opinie over de Nederlandse monarchie. Respondenten hebben uitgelegd of ze het behoud van de Nederlandse monarchie steunen of liever zien dat Nederland een republiek wordt en waarom. Binnen generatie Z en de babyboomgeneratie zijn zowel voorstanders als tegenstanders van het behoud van de Nederlandse monarchie geïnterviewd. 

Op basis van de bevindingen uit de interviews is de argumentatie van respondenten verdeeld in verschillende motiverende factoren. Vervolgens zijn de gebruikte motiverende factoren van respondenten per generatie vergeleken. De belangrijkste conclusie die hieruit getrokken kan worden is dat de twee generaties voornamelijk betreffende het niet steunen van de Nederlandse monarchie van elkaar verschillen. Respondenten uit generatie Z baseren het niet steunen van de monarchie meer op de kosten van de monarchie, respondenten uit de babyboomgeneratie baseren hun mening meer op het handelen van leden van de koninklijke familie. Bijna alle respondenten met een voorkeur voor een republiek vinden het aspect van erfopvolging niet passend binnen een democratie."

costs. Patient’s own medication (POM) use combined with self-administration of medication (SAM) during
hospitalisation might reduce medication wastage. 
Objective: To determine if POM use and SAM reduce the volume of medication waste during hospitalisation.
As secondary objectives the monetary value of the medication waste and the views of both patients and
hospital staff on medication wastage in relation to POM use and SAM were determined.
Methods: A prospective pre- post intervention study was conducted at the Elisabeth-Tweesteden Hospital,
Tilburg, The Netherlands. All patients admitted to the orthopaedic ward at location TweeSteden between
the 8
th of March 2022 and the 28th of May 2022 were included. Data on medication waste was collected in
volume of medicines (in pieces) and in monetary value (in €). A 5-point Likert scale survey was conducted to
get insight into the views of patients and hospital staff on medication wastage. All data were analysed using
descriptive statistics in SPSS.
Results: The volume of wasted medicines decreased with 44.3% from 477 to 331 pieces per 100 inpatient
days. The monetary value in hospital purchase price of wasted medicines decreased with 151.8% from
€283.80 to €112.70 per 100 inpatient days. Based on the national pharmacy purchase price, the decrease
was 382.4% from €549.90 to €114.00 per 100 inpatient days. Overall, both the patients and hospital staff
were positive towards POM use and SAM as means to reduce medication wastage.
Conclusion: The implementation of POM use and SAM during hospitalisation seems to have the potential to
reduce medication waste and concomitant costs at an orthopaedic ward."

The objective of this master’s thesis is therefore to develop a partial schema retrieval pipeline in order to solve the previously outlined problem. We evaluate the quality of our approach by measuring performance and completeness. This is conducted by running the pipeline against several SPARQL-endpoints. The pipeline lays the foundation for retrieving partial graph schemas per iteration. The result is a rendered set of visualisations of partial schemas displayed in a hierarchical aggregated view.

more difficulties emerge while modeling public transaction datasets, namely feature
anonymization, missing information, and data aggregation. This work suggests a
pipeline of modeling fraudulent transactions, which accounts for most of those
concerns based on other researchers’ experience. From the modeling approaches,
one can distinguish those based on transaction features and those using graph

Moving forward, Utrecht University wants to become zero waste in 2030. Can Utrecht University reduce its impact from plastic waste and become an example for decentralised, circular plastic waste management through pyrolysis? To answer this question this study was divided into three phases: Material Flow Analysis (MFA), Pyrolysis experiments and a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The MFA allowed to understand the composition of plastic waste on Utrecht Science Park and extrapolate this composition to the rest of the university. The pyrolysis experiments gave insight into the types of products which can be expected and their properties. Finally, the LCA summarised the environmental impacts on Climate Change, Cumulative Energy Demand and Freshwater Ecotoxicity. 
Plastic waste at the Utrecht Science Park mostly consists of PET bottles and food packaging (39.5% and 17.5% respectively). Around 12.3kg of clean plastics were estimated to be produced at the Ruppert, Bestuursgebouw, Educatorium and Library buildings. When extrapolating these results to a university-wide scale, 100kg of daily plastic waste can be pyrolyzed. From the pyrolysis stage, it was found that the pyrolysis gas produces enough heat to sustain the reaction at a pilot scale of 40kg per batch of plastic. The carbon content recovered in the pyrolysis products warrants a closure of loop so that the carbon is put back into the system by substituting naphtha for example. Moreover, the range of products which can be extracted range from light oils to waxes. The average impacts on a pilot scale were 0.75KgCO2-eq, -29MJ and 0.53PAF*m3*day for the three impact categories respectively. When comparing the decentralised pyrolysis system to a centralised system using mechanical recycling, it was found that the pyrolysis system has a 12% lower carbon footprint when the complete impacts of the cleaning stage was considered. Thus, proving the viability of such a decentralised pyrolysis system at Utrecht University."
Facilitation for the future: The Ozone Secretariat's role during the Kigali Amendment negotiations,"['Wijermars, Jannah']","['Kim, Rak']",2022-09-09T01:01:28Z,EN,['Ozone Secretariat; Montreal Protocol; Kigali Amendment; HFCs; Survival; Problem-shifting'],Sustainable Development,"The Kigali Amendment is the latest addition to the Montreal Protocol for Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. This Amendment ensures that HFCs are phased down under the Protocol’s regulations. The Ozone Secretariat has shown interest in phasing down HFCs directly after they were first discussed by some Parties. But why the Secretariat did so was puzzling. First, HFCs are not an ozone depleting substance (ODS) and have a high global warming potential. They are thus a problem for the Climate Regime, not the Ozone Regime. Secretariats in general do not go beyond their mandates, so why did the Ozone Secretariat do so now? The theoretical lens adopted in this research (i.e., Secretariats have autonomy and a will of their own) then leads to the following question: If the Secretariat had a motive to immediately jump on board HFCs, what was it? The existing research on both the Kigali Amendment and Secretariat motivations remains very limited. But these topics can yield interesting insights for both future politics and research, especially because the approach of the Ozone Regime has taken on the largest chunk of emissions that lead to climate change to date. To make this contribution, the research answers the following question: Why did the Ozone Secretariat facilitate the Kigali Amendment negotiations. To answer this question, first a hypothesis was built on why the Secretariat behaved as they did. It was expected they were motivated due to a drive for survival, as right before HFCs were discussed rumors surfaced that the job of the Secretariat was completed. It was also expected that they behaved in an autonomous way, had influence on the negotiation process and operated eagerly and from behind a veil of legitimacy. To test this hypothesis, 72 documents were analyzed, and 12 in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with key figures of the Kigali Amendment negotiations. The results confirm the Secretariat had autonomy and influence, was eager to jump on HFCs and operated from behind a veil of legitimacy. Also, their motivation to do so was driven by a need for survival. These findings make an important contribution to science and society. They give an overview of, holistically, how a Secretariat operates and, empirically, what drives them. Also, the study provides a theoretical starting point to conceptualize the phenomenon of reversed problem-shifting. Ultimately, the Secretariat’s approach can serve as an inspiration to take successful action on climate change."
Can carsharing reduce transport poverty?,"['Hönnige, Jana']","['Frenken, Koen']",2022-09-09T01:01:25Z,EN,"['carsharing, transport poverty, social cohesion, innovation, adoption, practices, mobility,']",Innovation Sciences,"Business-to-consumer carsharing is a promising innovation for supporting social cohesion by 
improving the mobility of people experiencing transport poverty. This potential is however neglected, 
as carsharing vehicles are under-proportionally supplied to transport-poor neighbourhoods. This 
paper aims to find reasons for this and analyses the potential for introducing carsharing in transport-poor neighbourhoods, covering the perspectives of multiple stakeholders. 

Roger’s barriers to adoption are applied to understand what stops individuals in transport-poor 
neighbourhoods from adopting carsharing. Additionally, the mobility practices of households in these 
neighbourhoods are observed through the lens of social practice theory, which sees practices as 
reoccurring actions that emerge at the interplay of systems of provision and lifestyles.

Regression analysis is applied to a sample of Dutch municipalities, evaluating the relationship 
between the supply of shared cars and socio-economic and geographic factors linked to transport 
poverty. Subsequently, interviews are conducted with representatives of providers, municipalities,
and social housing associations to identify mobility practices and needs, barriers, and promising 
strategies to increase carsharing adoption. Lastly, a user survey is evaluated to analyse the mobility 
practices of transport-poor households that already use carsharing.

The regression analysis confirms the negative correlation between carsharing supply and factors 
linked to transport poverty. It also shows that some municipalities perform better than others and 
that there are outlier neighbourhoods, where carsharing is performing over-proportionally well. The 
interviews show that while mobility practices are often conducive to carsharing with multiple 
intervention framings applicable, there are still barriers in place, such as a lack of financial literacy, 
status issues, and unawareness, leading to reduced adoption and profitability concerns for providers. 
Strategies to deal with these barriers are diverse, including policy approaches, cooperation, and 
marketing efforts. The survey results show that where available carsharing can be a beneficial 
mobility alternative for some transport-poor households when integrated into a transport mix.

This research helps to understand the unused potential for social equity impact when it comes to 
introducing carsharing in transport-poor neighbourhoods. While emphasizing that carsharing is not a 
solution for all mobility needs and all individuals affected by transport poverty, it is shown that it can 
mean an improvement for many, offering financial savings to those who previously owned a car and 
a larger mobility radius to those who did not. More support from municipalities as well as knowledge 
exchange and cooperation between stakeholders are however necessary to realise this potential."

The role of interconnection and storage for the integration of renewable energy in the Netherlands,"['Meerman, Sander']","['Gibescu, Madeleine']",2022-09-09T01:01:31Z,EN,['Interconnection; Renewables; Storage'],Energy Science,"The urge in the European Union to become less reliant on fossil fuel for its energy provision becomes in- creasingly important. Global warming and self sufficiency are key drivers for the Netherlands to deploy large numbers of variable renewable energy sources. However, integrating these variable energy sources in the existing energy system poses complex challenges, and requires a change of thinking in how energy is trans- ported and used in time. Amongst the expansion of the electricity grid, alternative energy carriers including hydrogen are widely being considered. Linking electricity with hydrogen production impacts several aspects of the power system, including curtailment of renewable generation and electricity prices. Using a linear optimal energy system model that allows for integrated expansion, the role of interconnection and storage for the integration of renewable energy in the Netherlands is assessed. The expansion of interconnection of electricity and hydrogen transmission develops from 2030 onward. Hydrogen storage enables for long term energy storage, but the degree of hydrogen storage for the integration of renewables, and in particular offshore wind, is strongly dependent on geographical location and rate of electrification of demand."
Software Architecture Decision Documentation and the Human Factors,"['Ham, Matthijs']","['Werf, J.M.E.M. van der']",2022-09-09T01:02:34Z,EN,[],Human-Computer Interaction,"Software architecture forms the critical link between the requirements and the implementation of any
well-designed system. Software architects create solutions based on both the requirements, and the
real-world possibilities that can be realized by the software developers. Decision making is one of the
main activities that architects partake in. However, decisions are often taken on the fly, and their rational
and reasoning is not always stored. This leads to knowledge erosion, which over time will lead to much
higher maintenance efforts for the system, incurring increased costs and lowered productivity. To prevent
this, decisions need to be written down, but this tends to be forgone for the benefit of quick development.
In this study we look at the factors that cause this lack of documentation, and how we can lower the
burden of documentation for practitioners using improved software architecture tooling, centered on the
needs of the architects. We found that even though the technology is there, the adoption of software
architecture tooling is still being hampered by human factors such as a lack of interest, or the fear of
a disrupted workflow. We developed a preliminary solution, which we discussed with five architects.
Through these interviews, we create several high-level requirements that can be used in the development
of new software architecture tooling."

A model-based simulation study is carried out to evaluate the performance of KNNImputer, IterativeImputer, miceforest and MIDASpy. The obtained results demonstrate that while under certain conditions IterativeImputer can show comparable performance to the conventional R imputation method mice, the other methods (KNNImputer, miceforest and MIDASpy) underperform under most conditions specified in this simulation study. This study suggests that it would be unwise to recommend these Python approaches as a general imputation strategy without a detailed comprehension of each of the method’s proper application settings and fine-tuning."

Jongeren bleken betekenis te geven aan hun etnisch-culturele deelidentiteiten door interacties met anderen. Respondenten lieten weten dat op school praten over hun identiteitsontwikkeling een positieve invloed had gehad op hun overgang naar de arbeidsmarkt. Andersom blijkt dat de ervaringen tijdens de overgang naar de arbeidsmarkt van invloed zijn op de etnisch-culturele identiteitsontwikkeling. Jongeren geven aan vaak onbewust te navigeren tussen hun deelidentiteiten. Soms gaat dit echter bewust, als gemerkt wordt dat een etnisch-culturele deelidentiteit geliefd dan wel afgekeurd wordt. Wanneer deelidentiteiten door de omgeving afgekeurd worden blijkt dat jongeren zich niet helemaal zichzelf voelen. Voorwaarden om zichzelf te zijn, en de meervoudige etnisch-culturele identiteit in verschillende contexten te kunnen laten zien zijn: met respect behandeld worden, begrepen worden, en het bevinden in een diverse omgeving. Deze studie benadrukt het belang om aandacht te besteden aan de etnisch-culturele identiteitsontwikkeling op school, zodat zij werkzoek- en werknemersvaardigheden ontwikkelen waarin hun etnisch-culturele identiteit gewaarborgd blijft.

Adapting a nutrition chatbot to the user’s nutrition and food literacy.,"['Giannikou, Evangelia']","['Hauptmann, Hanna']",2022-09-09T02:00:59Z,EN,['nutrition; chatbot; NLG; text-adaptation; nutrition & food literacy; behaviour change;'],Human-Computer Interaction,"Eating healthy is crucial to maintaining good health and avoiding diseases. Within the technology field, many nutrition applications and chatbots have been developed to promote healthy eating. However, the latter still faces a few challenges regarding user engagement. Users of low Health Literacy tend to be less engaged in using health chatbots as they do not understand medical terms that well. Moreover, there is little research about the Nutrition and Food Literacy (N&FL) of the user. In our study, we assessed the N&FL of the user with the Nutrition Literacy Scale (NLS) and developed a nutrition chatbot. The chatbot adapted its text on numeracy, vagueness and wording and provided nutrition re- ports. We conducted a within-subject experiment with 22 participants divided into two groups, adaptive and non-adaptive, that interacted with the equivalent chatbot.

We measured user engagement using quantitative methods. No significant differences were found between the groups as all participants followed similar engagement behaviour. However, this increased when push notifications were sent as reminders. In addition, we conducted seven interviews to measure user satisfaction and if they gained any new knowledge. The adaptive group was identified with a higher interest in nutrition than the non-adaptive, leading to lower satisfaction because of higher expectations from the chatbot. No one expressed any knowledge gain, but rather they gathered more insights into their daily diet. Finally, the textual content analysis showed that each group had different interests in their questions. Although our experiment did not have significant results, we believe this study gives new insights into a topic that has not been studied as much, namely adapting a nutrition chatbot to the user’s interests. We suggest that future work focuses on this direction. Due to the limitations of our study, we also propose repetition of the experiment with a more diverse sample in N&FL and a different N&FL assessment tool."

Ondanks de toenemende individualisering in Nederland, is het belang van het gezin in de ontwikkeling van kinderen belangrijk. Daarom dat de vraag ‘Hoe wordt prestatiedruk ervaren in het gezin?’ wordt beantwoord. Hypothese was dat een goed sociaal kapitaal van het gezin een dempende werking heeft op het ervaren van te veel prestatiedruk. METHODEN Om een vergelijking te kunnen maken zijn er focusgroepen (N=4) afgenomen met ouders (N=6) en jongeren (N=9), aan de hand van het uitvragen van het sociaal kapitaal van het gezin. RESULTATEN Prestatiedruk wordt ervaren in het gezin, voornamelijk komend uit maatschappelijke factoren. Desondanks speelt het gezin een rol, omdat ouders expliciet én impliciet verwachtingen hebben van hun kind. Door de adolescentie veranderen verhoudingen tussen ouder en adolescent, omdat de adolescent meer zelfstandigheid verwacht en opeist. Desondanks blijven ouders een belangrijke bron van steun en advies. DISCUSSIE Ouders kunnen dempend en versterkend werken in de ervaring van overmatige prestatiedruk bij adolescenten. Bij advies moeten ouders aansluiten bij leefwerelden van hun kind. Daarnaast zijn ouders zich bewust van de, vaak onbewuste, druk die zij op hun kind leggen. Het is belangrijk om vertrouwen en zelfstandigheid te geven aan de adolescent, omdat druk hoort bij het leven en er dus mee omgegaan moet worden. Het normaliseren van druk is belangrijk. Limitaties en aanbevelingen worden besproken."
Applying Mass Conservation to ADCP-data,"['Soons, Jelle']","['Maas, Leo']",2022-09-09T02:01:02Z,EN,['ADCP; mass conservation; turbulence anisotropy; internal waves'],Mathematical Sciences,"Adding mass constraints to existing ADCP-data results in improved velocity estimates in various
transducer configurations. The problem of estimating vertical velocity with a conventional set-up
in horizontally dominant flow is that inhomogenities in the horizontal velocities can cause relatively
large errors in the vertical velocity estimate. A possible solution to obtain more accurate vertical
velocity estimates using mass constraints is introduced. The corrected data is compared to the original uncorrected data. Then a novel configuration of transducers that is a combination of multiple
transducer-receivers in a buckyball set up is discussed. Mass constraints are applied to synthetic data
of this set up, and this leads in various circumstances to improved estimates. Also discussed is a proof
of concept showing the ability of this set up to measure the shearing motion of internal waves."

varying conditions (e.g. missing data mechanisms and missing data proportions),
handled by the three missingness techniques and multiple regression
models were estimated. Estimates were evaluated on bias, coverage rate and
confidence interval width were pooled and obtained. IterativeImputer generated
results that were relatively low in bias. However, the produced coverage

the confidence interval widths, as they were generally too small to contain
the true value of the data. The Python package doesn’t operate as adequately

"Voor de zinnen, ’t vernuft en het hart. Leven en werk van de historieschilder en alleskunner Louis Moritz (1771-1850)","['Koops, Bert-Jaap']","['Hoogenboom, Annemieke']",2022-09-09T02:02:58Z,NL,['historieschilderkunst; genreschilderkunst; portretkunst; beeldhouwkunst; werktuigbouwkunde; theater; negentiende eeuw'],Kunstgeschiedenis,"De Nederlandse negentiende-eeuwse schilderkunst kent vele kunstenaars die minder bekend maar wel de moeite van het kennen waard zijn. Een van hen is Louis Moritz (1771-1850), die in zijn tijd breed werd gewaardeerd als historieschilder en veelzijdig kunstenaar maar nu nog slechts bij enkele specialisten bekend is. Een onderzoek naar Moritz past in het streven de kunstgeschiedenis inclusiever te maken, door grotendeels vergeten kunstenaars te belichten en daarmee het beeld van de schilderkunst te verrijken.
Moritz is interessant omdat hij historieschilder was in een tijdperk waarin dat in Nederland ongebruikelijk was. In de historiografie komt hij naar voren als een verdienstelijk schilder die naast historiekunst in diverse andere genres werkte, ‘theatrale’ kunst maakte vanwege wortels in de toneelwereld, en bovendien geoefend was in werktuigbouwkunde. De combinatie van deze factoren is intrigerend en biedt aanleiding te onderzoeken hoe Moritz zich, als historieschilder en alleskunner, positioneerde in het kunstveld van zijn tijd.
Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd op basis van kritisch-historisch bronnenonderzoek en combineert een een klassieke ‘leven-en-werk’-studie met inzichten uit de sociale kunstgeschiedenis en Bourdieu’s notie van de kunstwereld als een veld waarin kunstenaars zich positioneren ten opzichte van elkaar en van andere actoren.
De scriptie begint met een biografische schets, waarin Moritz’ activiteiten in de kunsten en werktuigbouwkunde worden gereconstrueerd (hfd. 2). Vervolgens komt Moritz’ werk aan bod, zowel zijn historieschilderkunst (hfd. 3) als zijn portretkunst, genrekunst en beeldhouwkunst (hfd. 4). Bij elke kunstvorm passeren Moritz’ productie in het algemeen en enkele geselecteerde werken in het bijzonder de revue.
Het blijkt dat Moritz veel ondernam in het kunstveld. Hij schilderde voor zover bekend zo’n vijftig historiestukken, negentig portretten en honderd genrestukken, bij elkaar ongeveer 240 schilderijen. Ook zijn er diverse beelden van Moritz bekend en werktuigen als toneelmachines, ledenpoppen en een vroedkundig oefenmodel. Door zijn regelmatige kunstproductie en deelnames aan de Levende Meesters-tentoonstellingen vestigde hij een stevige reputatie in de kunstwereld als schilder en beeldhouwer. Verder was hij actief binnen de belangrijkste kunst- en wetenschapsgenootschappen van zijn tijd, Felix Meritis en het Koninklijk Instituut. Ook daarin valt de breedte van zijn werk op: hij adviseerde zowel over schilderkunstige kwesties als over architectuur, beeldhouwkunst en uitvindingen.
Vooral zijn historische panorama’s en schilderijen over de vaderlandse geschiedenis hebben Moritz een plaats bezorgd in het collectieve geheugen als historieschilder. De historiekunst vormt dan ook een belangrijk onderdeel van zijn kunstenaarschap. Zijn vele andere activiteiten hielpen daarbij, omdat hij elementen kon oefenen die te pas kwamen bij historiestukken, zoals het schilderen van portretten, paarden (een specialiteit van hem) en complexe composities. Tegelijkertijd zijn sommige portretten en genrestukken binnen hun genre innovatieve werken die ook een doel in zichzelf zijn. Dit illustreert de spreuk die Moritz eens bij de inzending van een genrestuk meegaf: een kunstenaar moet niet alleen werken voor de zinnen, maar ook voor het vernuft en het hart. Die plicht nam Moritz ook serieus in zijn portret- en genrekunst.
Al met al wist Moritz, als veelzijdig schilder, beeldhouwer en werktuigbouwkundige, een stevige positie wist te verwerven in het vroeg-negentiende-eeuwse kunstveld, al bleef hij daarbinnen wel altijd enigszins een buitenstaander. Hij was bij uitstek een maker, met een uitzonderlijke materiaalbeheersing. Door actief te zijn als generalist bereikte hij niet de toppositie binnen één genre, maar stond hij wel alom bekend als een verdienstelijk kunstenaar met een voortrekkersrol in de historiekunst."
Numerical KAM theory and backward error analysis for symplectic methods applied to (quasi-)periodically perturbed Hamiltonian ODE,"['Carere, Francesco']","['Frank, Jason']",2022-09-09T02:02:53Z,EN,"['KAM theory, symplectic integration, symplectic method, KAM theory for symplectic methods, backward error analysis, numerical Hamiltonian ODE, non-autonomous Hamiltonian ODE']",Mathematical Sciences,"Recenly, a model for tidal waves in shallow areas has been reconsidered, previously studied in the 1990's. The goal was to study mixing and transport due to chaotic motion in the periodic Poincar´e map. In this thesis, the study of this system is continued, shifting, however, the focus to regular instead of chaotic motion. Regular motion has been studied using Liouville (complete) integrability, action-angle coordinates and KAM theorems (we do not consider Nekhoroshev type theorems).

The Hamiltonian of the unperturbed tidal wave system is planar, so Liouville integrable and a first result of this thesis
is the explicit form of the action angle coordinates of the unperturbed tidal wave system.
Furthermore, from a mathematical viewpoint the tidal wave system is also interesting, as it is the natural
third example in the sequence: harmonic oscillator, pendulum , tidal wave system. Therefore it presents an interesting problem to test KAM theory.

The perturbed tidal wave system is a periodically perturbed planar Hamiltonian system (1+ 1/2 d.o.f.). A second result is a proof of existence of persistent invariant tori in the periodic Poincar´e map using a (already developed) KAM theorem for (quasi)-periodically perturbed systems.
In this thesis we are interested in the numerical side: A third result is the proof of a ""numerical” KAM theory for numerically integrated periodically perturbed systems, where the numerical integration is done using a symplectic integrator. This result is based on non-autonomous backward error analysis i.e. interpolation of symplectic maps by Hamiltonian flows. This numerical KAM theorem is not able to prove the existence of invariant tori of the periodic Poincar´e map of the symplectically integrated the tidal wave system. Therefore we present an ‘approximate’ KAM theorem, which proves, up to an assumption,
the existence of ‘approximate’ KAM tori in the numerical, periodic Poincar´e map over exponentially long
times, which is the final result of this thesis.

Finally, we mention that backward error analysis (BEA) is of central importance to this thesis. Indeed in
both the theoretical system as well as the numerically integrated system, the proof of the above mentioned
KAM theorems was through the continuous setting (Kolmogorov/Arnolds setting i.e. flows) and not the
discrete (Mosers setting i.e. symplectic maps) and to this end BEA was used to embed the discrete
symplectic integrator into a Hamiltonian flow. Since BEA explains the well-behavedness of symplectic
integrators applied to autonomous Hamiltonian problems a minor part of this thesis was devoted to the
development of modified equation analysis (a type of BEA) for non-autonomous ODE."

The anti-Black sentiments deriving from coloniality are at the core of securitisation, surveillance and policing which influences how the highly discretionary stop and search policing powers are implemented throughout Global North. Borrowing from the Anglophonic approach to race, this thesis challenges the European race/colour-blindness by introducing a postcolonial and Critical Race Theory reading of legal and policy documents, as well as the contemporary public and political debates surrounding the racially motivated over-policing of Black and brown bodies in the post-George Floyd Europe. By tracing the anti-Blackness of surveillance and policing, along with the Anglophonic history of stop and search policing the research creates a comparison point for three case studies looking at racially discriminatory stop and search policing in contemporary France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. As the historical and theoretical analysis shows, the core of surveillance and policing is the fact of Blackness, and as such this thesis aims to show how the narrative of race/colour-blind Europe is in fact a destructive fallacy. At best this narrative denies the experiences of Black and brown bodies of discriminatory over-policing, and at worst this denial is creating bare-life conditions in which Black and brown bodies are subjected to necropolitical policing power. The critical and postcolonial lenses used in this research recognise that stop and search policing does not happen in a vacuum, but that the colonial anti-Black history of surveillance and policing enables this necropolitical policing power. Focusing on case studies in Europe, this thesis challenges the narrative of the European race/colour-blind narrative, calling for more critical engagement with Europe’s shared colonial history."

problemen ervaren met het bespreken van controversieel verleden in de klas. Hoog oplopende
emoties veroorzaken onveilige situaties in de les, docenten hebben moeite met het vormgeven van
de wijze waarop controversiële geschiedenis besproken wordt en docenten nemen een morele
benadering in of vermijden het bespreken van meerdere perspectieven. Op basis hiervan is een
mysterieopdracht op basis van een ‘koud’ en een ‘heet’ controversieel onderwerp ontworpen, die
door docenten gebruikt kan worden om meerdere perspectieven op controversieel verleden te
bespreken. Het ontwerp is gebaseerd op zeven ontwerpcriteria die vastgesteld zijn op basis van
Actief Historisch Denken.
Dit heeft geleid tot de volgende hoofdvraag: Waaraan moet een mysterieopdracht voldoen om
meerdere perspectieven op controversiële geschiedenis bespreekbaar te maken?
De mysterieopdracht is geëvalueerd door docenten geschiedenis. Zij gaven feedback op de mate
waarin de ontwerpcriteria herkenbaar waren in het ontwerp. Deze feedbackronde heeft geleid tot
enkele aanpassingen aan het ontwerp. Dit herontwerp is doormiddel van een try-out getest in een
lesomgeving. Hierbij zijn observatieformulieren bijgehouden en geanalyseerd op basis van codering.
Het onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat het ontwerp de leerlingen in staat stelde om zelf de historische
context te reconstrueren en daarbij verschillende perspectieven op het controversiële onderwerp te
bespreken. Hiervoor maakten de leerlingen gebruik van de drie temporele kaders. Uit de uitvoering
van de opdracht kwam naar voren dat leerlingen moeite hebben met het reconstrueren van een
context waarbij voorbij de verantwoordelijkheid van het leiderschap gekeken wordt. Daarnaast is
vastgesteld dat de verdeling over twee lessen gezorgd heeft voor een didactisch makkelijkere
uitvoering. Om te zorgen dat leerlingen geconfronteerd worden met hun eigen perspectief moet
ervoor gezorgd worden dat er voorkennis bestaat over het behandelde onderwerp."

Combining Branch-and-bound and Constraint Programming for the Job-Shop Problem,"['Sluis, Thimon van der']","['Hoogeveen, Han']",2022-09-09T02:02:54Z,EN,['Job-Shop Problem; Constraint Programming; Branch-and-bound'],Computing Science,"The Job Shop Problem is a well-studied scheduling problem which is proven to be
NP-Hard. The Job Shop Problem consists of a set of jobs and a set of machines.
For each job, one activity has to be processed on each machine and the order in
which the activities have to be executed is predetermined for each job. The goal
is to choose an ordering of activities for each machine such that the makespan
is minimized. Approximation methods seem to work quite well at finding good
solutions fast, but exact methods have trouble finding optima, especially for the
bigger instances. In this thesis, we look at two exact methods for the Job Shop
Problem, Branch-and-bound and Constraint Programming, and we test whether
combining these two techniques reduces the amount of time needed to solve instances
of the Job Shop Problem. To efficiently do this, we created new branching structures
which make use of Constraint Programming in their choice of the next branch and
then propagate the consequences of these choices. We found that adding Constraint
Programming to a Branch-and-bound algorithm improves its efficiently by a lot, but
calculating lower bounds in each node of a Constraint Programming algorithm has
little effect and in some cases it even slows down the algorithm. A possible reason for
this result is that both the edge-finding Constraint Propagation technique and the
preemptive one-machine relaxation make use of the Jackson Preemptive Schedule in
their calculations. Since the latter is used in cutting of branches of the search tree,
it is possible that it is dominated by the Constraint Propagation techniques."

We used data from self-report questionnaires measuring IU, EA, depression, anxiety and neuroticism of 441 undergraduate students (79% female) and conducted mediation analyses using PROCESS for IBM SPSS. We found a partial mediation effect of EA on the associations between IU and depression and anxiety, which stayed significant when controlling for neuroticism. Future studies should examine the direction of the relationships using experimental designs to deepen the understanding of the associations and the etiology and to improve prediction and treatment of depression and anxiety."

It is therefore important that research is carried out into the behavior and distribution of house sparrows. Conceptual behavioral model can be used to explore the interaction between the spatial environments and the behavior of the house sparrows to develop pathways that predict the spatial distribution of House sparrows. The method was to design a conceptual behavior model by developing an agent-based model in Netlogo. From the model, pathways 1, 2, 3, 4 and standard are designed. Pathways 1 and 3 provide the best distribution of house sparrows over the buildings, while the standard pathway and pathway 4 have the poorest distribution of house sparrows. The developed model only partly corresponds to real-world observations but large standard deviations. initial birds and predators have the greatest influence on the total population. Green gardens and predators have only a very small influence on the spatial distribution of house sparrows. The suitability of the houses has the greatest influence on the spatial distribution of house sparrows. It is important to note that there is a major difference compared to the original agent-based model. The improvements in the model have led to more interaction between the spatial environments and the behavior of the house sparrows. This makes the model suitable for studying the spatial distribution of house sparrows.

The NPO measures diversity through a questionnaire, which asks people to what extent they see or hear people from different population groups in an episode. This thesis aims to predict this ‘diversity score’ using TF, TF-IDF and LDA, to gain insight into the predictive capacity of words and topics for diversity in media content. Both words and topics are found that predict this measure of diversity: the diversity score can be predicted with explained variances between 8% and 49.7%, depending on the dataset."
Co-creatie van publieke waarden in de algoritmische wereld van platformbedrijven: met of zonder tussenkomst van overheidsorganisaties?,"['Dharmlal, Pravina']","['Winnubst, Madelinde']",2022-09-09T03:01:39Z,NL,"['citizen science, business science, digitale platformen, datamanagement, publieke waardecreatie, smart governance']","Communicatie, beleid en management","In dit onderzoek zullen de perspectieven van de verschillende belanghebbenden van citizen science en business science-platformen Snuffelfiets en CoVadem worden on- derzocht die publieke waarden dienen: een schonere leefomgeving en duurzamer va- ren. De onderzoeksvragen die hierbij zijn opgesteld, zijn:

Onderzoeksvraag 1: “Hoe krijgt datamanagement vorm in de digitale platformen Snuffelfiets en CoVadem waarbij gebruik gemaakt wordt van citizen science en busi- ness science, en wat zijn de opvattingen van experts hierover?”

Onderzoeksvraag 2: “Welke relatie is er tussen de digitale platformen Snuffelfiets en CoVadem en smart governance versus publieke waardecreatie?”

In het literatuuronderzoek zijn de relevante concepten voor dit onderzoek uiteengezet. De eerste vier concepten zijn (1) datamanagement, (2) digitale platformen, (3) citizen science en (4) business science. Deze concepten vormen samen de kern van de eerste onderzoeksvraag. De laatste twee concepten zijn (5) publieke waardecreatie en (6) smart governance. Deze concepten hebben - samen met digitale platformen, citizen science en business science - betrekking op de tweede onderzoeksvraag.

Voor dit onderzoek (dat bestaat uit twee delen) zijn in het eerste deel tien semigestructureerde interviews afgenomen met de oprichters, werknemers en burgers van beide platformen (vijf interviews per platform). Na afloop zijn de interviews getranscribeerd waarna het mogelijk werd om deze te analyseren met behulp van drie stappen van de Grounded-Theory (Baxter & Babbie, 2003): open coderen, axiaal co- deren en selectief coderen. Dit geldt voor zowel het eerste, als het tweede deel van het onderzoek.

In het tweede deel van dit onderzoek zijn de resultaten uit de analyses van deze interviews voorgelegd aan vier experts: één citizen science-expert, één business science-expert, één datamanagement expert en één expert van Rijkswaterstaat om haar perspectief op de rol van (deze) overheidsorganisatie te verklaren als het gaat om citizen science en business science. Deze experts hebben namelijk hun eigen visies op het datamanagement van deze citizen science en business science-platformen.

Uit dit onderzoek zijn verschillende resultaten voortgekomen. Ten eerste heeft de vormgeving van data op beide platformen - aangaande de processen om data te verzamelen - meer overeenkomsten dan verschillen. Het belangrijkste overeenkomst is dat de gepubliceerde data op beide platformen betrouwbaar zijn door de kwaliteitschecks en betrouwbare opslaggebieden van beide platformen waarmee de nauwkeurigheid van de data wordt nagestreefd. Hierbij is betrouwbaarheid een dimensie, en nauwkeurigheid een element van datamanagement volgens Cai en Zhu (2015). Een opvallend verschil tussen de twee platformen is dat de fietsers een hogere geloofwaardigheid - ook een element van datamanagement (Cai & Zhu, 2015) - van de data van het dashboard van Snuffelfiets hebben dan de schippers van de data van de desktop op CoVadem.

Ten tweede komen de relatie tussen Snuffelfiets en smart governance, en de re- latie tussen CoVadem en smart governance, overeen (met uitzondering van de besluitvormingsprocessen). De belangrijkste uitkomst duidt op het niet gebruiken van ICT (bijvoorbeeld nieuwe communicatiekanalen) door beide platformen. Hoewel ICT voor interacties een betere samenwerking zou kunnen realiseren tussen de ver- schillende belanghebbenden zoals de platform-eigenaren en de gebruikers (Bolìvar & Meijer, 2015; Giffinger et al., 2007; Pereira et al., 2018).

De relatie tussen beide platformen en publieke waardecreatie komen overeen: op beide platformen vindt co-creatie van publieke waarde plaatst door interacties tussen burgers, bedrijven en organisaties. Hierbij hebben burgers een actieve rol aangenomen in het project in plaats van enkel de rol van consument (Osborne, 2018)."
Network analysis to identify communities among multiple exposure biomarkers measured at birth in three Flemish general population samples,"['Ottenbros, Ilse']","['Vermeulen, Roel']",2022-09-09T03:01:45Z,EN,['Mixtures; human biomonitoring; network analysis; clustering'],Epidemiology Postgraduate,"Introduction   Humans are exposed to multiple environmental chemicals via different sources resulting in complex real-life exposure patterns. Insight into these patterns is important for applications such as linkage to health effects and (mixture) risk assessment. By providing internal exposure levels of (metabolites of) chemicals, biomonitoring studies can provide snapshots of exposure patterns and factors that drive them. Presentation of biomonitoring data in networks facilitates the detection of such exposure patterns and allows for the systematic comparison of observed exposure patterns between datasets and strata within datasets.  
Methods   We demonstrate the use of network techniques in human biomonitoring data from cord blood samples collected in three campaigns of the Flemish Environment and Health Studies (FLEHS) (sampling years resp. 2002-2004, 2008-2009 and 2013-2014). Measured biomarkers were multiple organochlorine compounds, PFAS and metals. Comparative network analysis (CNA) was conducted to systematically compare networks between sampling campaigns, smoking status during pregnancy, and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.
Results   Network techniques offered an intuitive approach to visualize complex correlation structures within human biomonitoring data. The identification of groups of highly connected biomarkers, “communities”, within these networks highlighted which biomarkers should be considered collectively in the analysis and interpretation of epidemiological studies or in the design of toxicological mixture studies. Network analyses demonstrated in our example to which extent biomarker networks and its communities changed across the sampling campaigns, smoking status during pregnancy, and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.
Conclusion   Network analysis is a data-driven and intuitive screening method when dealing with multiple exposure biomarkers, which can easily be upscaled to high dimensional HBM datasets, and can inform mixture risk assessment approaches."
Wind-Powered Offshore Electrolysis: Diving into the Possibilities and Uncertainties of Hydrogen Production in the North Sea,"['Koiter, Luuk']","['Gazzani, Matteo']",2022-09-09T03:01:33Z,EN,['Offshore Wind; Electrolysis; Hydrogen; Offshore Hydrogen; Offshore Electrolysis'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The energy sector is one of the main contributors to global carbon emissions. To be able to keep the increase in global temperatures to a minimum, decarbonization of the sector is of paramount importance. In the Netherlands, there is a large potential for large offshore wind parks, which can produce high amounts of electrical energy. However, wind energy faces two challenges in comparison to carbon-rich fuels. Firstly, the storage of electricity is expensive and has a high depreciation rate. Secondly, there are sectors which require high-temperature heating for which electricity is not suitable. For these two challenges hydrogen provides an alternative pathway. For a couple of years, an existing new field opened up combining these two factors in the North Sea, namely offshore hydrogen production.
This research aimed to understand the most influential parameters which influence the choice for performing the production of hydrogen onshore or offshore. In four case studies, the expected major contributors to the system costs were examined. First, a direct comparison was made between on- and offshore electrolysis. Secondly, the influence of the distance of the wind parks to the shore was examined. Thirdly, the influence of different allowed electrolysis capacities installed onshore was tested. Finally, the contribution of repurposing existing infrastructure was investigated.
For the base case comparison of on- and offshore electrolysis the LCOH was determined to be 4.60 €/kg and 5.46 €/kg respectively. An analysis of the costs of each component, designated the costs concerned with installing an electrolyser offshore to be the main contributor to the increase in LCOH. The distance at which offshore electrolysis was an economically viable option was determined to be 475 km. Moreover, the variation of onshore capacity and the decrease in network costs were proven to have no significant effect on the design and operation of the energy system. Lastly, the number of turbines installed, the combined electrolyser size and the size of the hydrogen cavern remained constant throughout this research.
The results in this research have yet to be subjected to an extensive sensitivity analysis to investigate the robustness of the results presented."
Developing an assessment framework for circularity in dike reinforcement projects,"['Schemmekes, Niek']","['Lutz, Stefanie']",2022-09-09T03:01:37Z,EN,['Circularity; Assessment framework; Dike reinforcements; Sustainable resource use; Circular Economy; Reuse; Recycling; Future proof'],Water Science and Management,"In the Netherlands, the objective of the Ministry of Infrastructure & Environment is to realise a full 
circular economy in 2050, where an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in primary resource use in 
2030 should be realised. In the coming thirty years, 1300 kilometres of dikes in the Netherlands must 
be reinforced to cope with rising sea levels caused by climate change. These dike reinforcement 
projects must conform with the circularity objectives of the government.

To support improved implementation of circularity in DR projects, this study conceptualised circularity 
in this context based on a literature review and interviews with practitioners in the sector. In this 
conceptualisation, circularity is considered a tool to maintain resource stocks, protect the environment 
and retain the value of objects/materials. This resulted in six categories that must be considered; the 
categories treat topics like the quantity of material use, the circular characteristics of input and output 
materials, the inclusion of future perspectives and interests in designs, the impact of material use, and 
the uncertainty of the data.

To track the progress of circular implementation in DR projects, an assessment framework was 
developed that compares different dike designs using the six categories from the conceptual 
framework. Each category has measurable aspects that can be used to determine a score for each 
category. To determine the final circularity score, each category is assessed and weighted depending 
on the perceived importance to circularity of an expert panel. In this way, circularity can be measured 
and assessed in DR project during the entire life cycle"

a major role in technological advancement and the endurance of comparative advantages of an economy.
The success rate and efficiency with which such efforts can be executed is likely correlated with the
economy’s position along the business cycle. Economic confidence sentiments(‘Animal spirits’) have been
shown to affect the strength of the business cycle movements. This study aims to examine whether such
sentiments affect private market innovative efforts both indirectly, through this effect on the business
cycle, as well as in a direct way controlling for the business cycle effects. Quantitative analysis on a
dynamic panel dataset of 12 EU member states using both a Fixed-effect model with Driscoll Kraay
standard errors, as well as an Arellano-Bond GMM model is performed. The individual results for
entrepreneurship and R&D are somewhat mixed, however when combined, signs of a significant and
sizable effect seem to emerge. Such findings seem to be a novelty within the literature and could help
improve the innovation-targeting policy efforts of governmental institutions as well as our broader
understanding of the interrelatedness of economic and societal phenomena."

The study of the relation between inflation and stock returns has been one of the more fascinating historical issues. This paper adds to the knowledge of previous studies by using the adjusted CBI factor as a variable to explain the relationship between stock price return and inflation rate using a data set from the G7 countries. By extending the analytical framework of earlier study, an empirical study was carried out. When central bank independence is included as an explanatory variable in the regression analysis, the results show a stronger negative association between inflation rates and stock returns. The findings have important implications since they offer different insights on central banks' independence level, knowledge from earlier studies of inflation and stock returns, and considerations for both investors and monetary officials who determine the CBI's constituent parts."

"Van Excuustruus tot Noodzakelijk Breekijzer:
Een kwalitatief onderzoek naar de bestaande frames omtrent de invoering van een vrouwenquotum in de vier grootste nationale kranten in Nederland tussen 2008 en 2022","['Gennep, Milou van']","['Loos, Eugene']",2022-09-09T03:03:21Z,NL,['framing; vrouwenquotum; communicatie; gender ; genderongelijkheid; politiek; quota'],"Communicatie, beleid en management","Genderongelijkheid op de werkvloer heeft als thema lange tijd in Nederland op de agenda gestaan. Nadat in andere Europese en Scandinavische landen al vanaf 2003 wettelijke vrouwenquota werden ingevoerd, om de top van het bedrijfsleven heterogener te maken, ontstond er in Nederland rond 2008 steeds meer discussie over dit onderwerp. De vraag rees: moet een dergelijk vrouwenquotum er ook in ons land komen? Uiteindelijk is op 1 januari 2022 de ‘wet ingroeiquotum en streefcijfers’, in de volksmond ‘het vrouwenquotum’, in werking getreden.
Een groot deel van de discussie die vooraf is gegaan aan de invoering van deze wet, heeft zich afgespeeld in de media. Omdat het meer dan 10 jaar heeft geduurd, is er in dit onderzoek op kwalitatieve wijze aan de hand van framing in krantenartikelen gekeken naar hoe dit debat er nu eigenlijk uit heeft gezien.
Framen heeft te maken met de manier waarop er over een bepaalde kwestie wordt gesproken of geschreven. Hierbij worden bepaalde aspecten van een waargenomen werkelijkheid geselecteerd en naar voren gehaald in een communicatietekst (Entman, 1993). Het proces van framen is inherent aan de journalistiek wat ervoor zorgt dat de berichtgeving in kranten niet neutraal is. Krantenartikelen vormen daarmee geschikt onderzoeksmateriaal om inzicht te verkrijgen in het maatschappelijk debat rondom een bepaalde kwestie.
Aan de hand van een inductieve inhoudsanalyse van 274 artikelen uit de vier grootste kranten (Het Algemeen Dagblad, De Telegraaf, De Volkskrant en het NRC) is tussen 2008 en 2022 gezocht naar bestaande frames die samenhangen met de eventuele invoering van een vrouwenquotum. Het startpunt 2008 is gekozen op basis van een quickscan, die liet zien dat er vanaf dit jaar discussie ontstond over een eventueel quotum in Nederland. Het eindpunt betreft 31 januari 2022 zodat er nog tot een maand na de invoering van het quotum data kon worden meegenomen. In totaal zijn er 17 frames gereconstrueerd die een afspiegeling vormen van het debat zoals er in de onderzochte kranten over is geschreven door journalisten, columnisten, experts en burgers (aan de hand van ingezonden brieven). Deze zeventien frames zijn in de volgorde van hun frequentie (van hoog naar laag): ‘Noodzakelijk breekijzer’, ‘Ongewenste overheidsbemoeienis’, ‘Old Boys Network’, ‘Poldercompromis’, ‘Excuus Truus’, ‘De moederschapsboete’, ‘Vrouwen als balanstrutjes’, ‘Diversiteit loont’, ‘Dwang is nodig’, ‘We lopen achter’, ‘Verinnerlijkt glazen plafond’, ‘Symboolpolitiek’, ‘Kunstmatig noodverband’, ‘Girl Power’, ‘Discriminatie’, ‘De deeltijdcultuur’ en ‘Crisis’.
De gevonden frames bezitten allemaal een logische keten van redenering waarbij ze een eigen probleemdefinitie, causale interpretatie, morele evaluatie en eventuele oplossing promoten (Entman, 1993; Van Gorp, 2007) en zijn in de resultatensectie samengevoegd in een visuele weergave (Figuur 4.1, paragraaf 4.11) waarin ook de onderlinge verbanden tussen de frames naar voren worden gebracht. Daarnaast bleek dat er, van het totaal aan gevonden frames, acht frames tegen een vrouwenquotum redeneerden en zes frames voor. Nog drie frames namen een tussenpositie in het debat in.
Het frame ‘Noodzakelijk Breekijzer’ kwam niet alleen het meest voor (uitgaande van het aantal fragmenten waarop het frame is gebaseerd), maar lijkt ook een sleutelrol te hebben gespeeld in het kantelen van het debat. Rond 2019 ontstond er een shift in het denken over een vrouwenquotum, omdat het inmiddels te lang begon te duren en er geen andere oplossing meer voor handen leek te zijn. Sommige gebruikers van dit frame, benadrukten dat zij oorspronkelijk tegen het gebruik van quota waren, maar dat het helaas toch nodig bleek en als ‘noodzakelijk breekijzer’ moest dienen. Er zou kunnen worden gesteld dat dit frame, ondanks de veelheid aan tegengeluiden, een belangrijke rol heeft gespeeld in de uitkomst van het debat."
"CO2 Capture from Steel Gases ‒ using 
Pressure Swing Adsorption model 
in Aspen AdsorptionTM","['Wasefi, Saima']","['Gazzani, Matteo']",2022-09-09T03:03:19Z,EN,[],Energy Science,"ABSTRACT
Industry and Petroleum refineries are among the most significant contributors to anthropogenic CO2
emissions. Within the industry, the iron and steel industry is the most energy-consuming manufacturing 
sector. Iron and steel production is still primarily coal-based, thus dependent on fossil fuels responsible 
for CO2 emissions. In 2020, the global iron and steel industry has emitted about 2.6 Gt of CO2, about 
8.3% of the world's CO2 emissions.
Mitigating these total CO2 emissions while steel production continues to rise is the major challenge for 
the iron and steel industry. Therefore, carbon capture is essential to enable the use of carbon while 
reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Tata Steel Ijmuiden is exploring various CO2 capture 
technologies for their CO2 emission mitigation, including physical adsorption. As such, this thesis is 
aimed to establish the benchmark numbers for the performance of a PSA unit capturing CO2 from a gas 
mixture of blast furnace gas and basic oxygen furnace gas. 
The PSA unit was modelled using aspen adsorption software, where the physical adsorption takes place 
on selected zeolite 13X particles. The model has been validated with experimental data from the 
literature and optimised in an extensive parameter study. The system operated between 15bar and 0.1 
bar pressure, and the operating temperature was the same as the feed gas temperature, 288 K. To process 
24104 kmol of feed gas per hour, 390 trains of two parallel adsorption beds were required with a length 
of 9 meters and a diameter of 0.75 meters. The PSA system had a specific energy demand of 1,87 GJ 
per tonne of CO2 captured for its pressure reduction and increase. Ultimately, 1.9 million tonnes of CO2
is captured in this system annually, with a recovery rate of 84%. The CO2 purity, on the other hand, is 
94%mols."

Reading the Male Gaze in Contemporary Opera Performances of Richard Strauss’ Salome.","['Hadermann, Eline']","['Brillenburg Wurth, Kiene']",2022-09-09T03:03:31Z,EN,['Opera; Richard Strauss; Literary Studies; Performance'],Comparative Literary Studies,"With Salome’s famous ‘Dance of the Seven Veils’, the essential role of looking in the story and the libretto’s wordplay concerning ‘gazing’ and the visual senses, Richard Strauss’ Salome is one of the most salient examples of a canonical opera pervaded with the oppressive mechanism of the male gaze. The latter feminist concept, having been coined in film studies and applied in related fields such as literary studies, has generated a large body of feminist rewritings of canonical literary works, demonstrating artistic resistance to the male gaze and the dangerous consequences it entails. However, although canonical opera scores and libretti have been subjected to feminist criticism as well, the act of rewriting these texts from a feminist perspective is rarely undertaken. This thesis departs from the contention that operatic artistic resistance to the male gaze does not belong to the realm of rewriting, but that of rereading as a creative resource to critically reinvent canonical opera texts through performative elements on the contemporary operatic stage. By attending to opera’s performative elements through close reading, this thesis thus aims to explore the ways in which we can read critical dramaturgical and performative engagements with the male gaze and its dangerous implications in contemporary operatic performances of Richard Strauss’ Salome: Gabriele Lavia’s production for Teatro Comunale di Bologna (2010), Ivo Van Hove’s production for Dutch National Opera (2017) and Aïda Gabriëls’ new creation Dance of the Seven Veils for Toneelhuis (2021/2022)."

This paper investigates the reaction of multinational companies in the entertainment and media (E&M) industry to different unforeseen crises and risks. The study is devoted to the research of the influence of new challenges on the E&M industry and the way how companies manage their strategies in response to various crises and risks. It is conducted through the anecdotal case study of the Walt Disney Company (TWDC), a major entertainment and media company. The article is directed at finding the answer to the research question “How can entertainment and media companies effectively manage their strategies in different segments during new challenges?” and hypothesizes that conglomerates have greater exposure to crises and risk than other organizations, and conglomerates that manage crises and risks can not only suffer but also win, and when crises or risks hit conglomerates they can offset the losses of one division with the success of another. After a thorough review of the literature on unforeseen crises and risk management, and companies’ decisions about business units’ management in the E&M industry, the author analyses the effects of different crises and risks, and the reaction of the industry as a whole and conducts an in-depth analysis via the example of TWDC. In the course of the study, the actions of companies in the moments of facing difficulties are analyzed and recommendations are given accordingly. The author also discusses the paper’s limitations and highlights areas for potential further research."

Het doel van deze masterscriptie was om te onderzoeken of dergelijke aanpassingen ook worden aangetroffen in vertaalde jeugdliteratuur voor een doelpubliek tussen de twaalf en negentien jaar. Dit is gedaan door vast te stellen met welke vertaalstrategieën cultuurspecifieke elementen werden vertaald in een corpus van historische jeugdromans voor de leeftijdscategorieën 12-15 jaar en 15-19 jaar. Hoewel er een beperkte hoeveelheid data in het corpus werd aangetroffen, kon uit de aanwezige data worden afgeleid dat vertalers van historische jeugdromans een voorkeur hebben voor brontekstgerichte vertaalstrategieën als herhaling, leenvertaling en orthografische aanpassing. In de meeste gevallen werd ervoor gekozen om de connotatie met de vreemde cultuur te behouden. Voor sommige cultuurspecifieke elementen gold echter wel dat ook doeltaalgerichte strategieën als kernvertaling en naturalisering vaker werden toegepast. Opvallend was dat deze strategieën vaker voorkwamen in het corpus voor vijftien- tot negentienjarigen dan voor twaalf- tot vijftienjarigen. Op basis van de data kon hiervoor geen duidelijke reden worden aangewezen. Wel werden deze strategieën vooral toegepast om verwijzingen naar materieel-culturele of sociaal-culturele elementen te vertalen. De gekozen strategie zorgde in de meeste gevallen niet voor functieverschuivingen van het cultuurspecifieke element in de brontekst in vergelijking met met de doeltekst. De resultaten suggereren dat de vertalers van jeugdliteratuur belang hechten aan het behoud van cultuurspecifieke elementen in hun vertalingen, hoewel zij in mindere mate wel kiezen voor strategieën die een extra toelichting bieden of het culturele element neutraliseren. Op basis van het onderzochte corpus zijn verder geen significante verschillen aan te wijzen tussen de vertaalstrategieën die werden gebruikt in de twee leeftijdscategorieën."

In dit onderzoek is in de context van regio Maassluis, Vlaardingen en Schiedam onderzocht welke factoren voor samenwerking kunnen bijdragen aan deze verschuiving van silo’s naar integratie. De volgende onderzoeksvraag is beantwoord in dit onderzoek: Hoe kan interorganisatorische samenwerking bijdragen aan de verschuiving van silo’s naar integratie in de ouderenzorg in de regio Maassluis, Vlaardingen en Schiedam?
Om dit te onderzoeken zijn 23 semigestructureerde interviews gehouden met managers, beleidsmedewerkers en professionals werkzaam in de medische en sociale ouderenzorg. De resultaten geven aan dat er voornamelijk behoefte is aan meer coördinatie en structuur voor de verschuiving naar integratie. Voor managers en beleidsmedewerkers is het daarnaast ook belangrijk dat zij elkaar en elkaars culturen beter leren kennen en een groter urgentiebesef voelen voor integratie. Daarnaast speelt de rol van financiering een belangrijke rol. Dit onderzoek draagt bij aan de bestaande theorie omdat factoren voor samenwerking nog niet eerder in Nederlandse context zijn getoetst op de verschuiving van silo’s naar integratie.

By deploying a hauntological approach, this project aims to make visible who is included in and excluded from the current Western project of making the world sustainable, that is preventing further global warming and mass extinction. The first chapter argues that sustainability can be understood as relying predominantly on the three Western concepts of nature, culture and temporality which themselves contain histories of violence and exclusion. By deconstructing intersecting projects of these three concepts like the Anthropocene, the nature-culture dichotomy, and linear temporality the chapter argues that sustainability predominantly conserves and maintains the dominance of the current power structures. Thus the chapter argues that sustainability disguises a political project which appears to altruistically save humanity and the whole planet. A critique which becomes more pointed in the second chapter which close-reads the racism inscribed into sustainability. Therefore this chapter scrutinises how Western narratives on the origin of the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic deploy the term sustainability in order to legitimise Western dominance. The third and last chapter of this thesis illustrates how transness diffracts sustainability and its three foundational concepts temporality, nature and culture. However, a trans perspective does not only offer critique on the exclusion of transness from sustainability but its diffracting character enables a different way to face global warming. This alternative draws from an embodied trans perspective in order to un-layer and re-layer meaning and matter and through this moves away from the humanist Western claims for dominance embedded into sustainability."

To be able to improve the image of a city by using greening, city marketing and the participation of residents, it is necessary to gain more knowledge about the relations between placemaking, city branding and city marketing and spatial interventions. Therefore, the research question of this study is ‘How does the municipality of Lelystad use spatial interventions to promote Lelystad as the capital of new nature? And how are the residents of Lelystad perceiving this?’. 

Lelystad, the capital of Flevoland, is used as a case study in this research. The focus of this research is on Lelystad because the municipality of Lelystad wants to create a new image 'Lelystad as the capital of new nature'. They want to do this by using spatial interventions that represent the new nature. During this research several methods have been applied to collect findings regarding the intended image of Lelystad. First, a document analysis was done with twenty-three policy documents that provided insight into the policy and planning context at different levels: global, European, national, regional and local. In addition, 16 persons were interviewed, including eleven residents of Lelystad and five officials at the municipality and the province. On one hand, the interviews served to gain insight in how the residents of Lelystad look at their city and to what extent they see the intended image represented in the landscape of Lelystad. On the other hand, the interviews with the government officials had the purpose to know more about the implementation of Lelystad as capital of the new nature including the spatial interventions that have been made. 

The results of the research did not entirely correspond with what had been found in the literature and what had been expected on the basis of the policy documents concerning Lelystad as the capital of the new nature. No direct relation was found between the three elements: placemaking, spatial interventions and city marketing and city branding. However, there is a relation between the image of the residents of Lelystad and the way the landscape is perceived. According to the residents, Lelystad is a green city. It is currently not clear how the municipality of Lelystad uses spatial interventions to promote Lelystad as the capital of new nature. The reason is that the policy has not been implemented. However, National Park Nieuw Land is used as an example of a landscape feature and spatial intervention. According to the interviewed government officials, the municipality of Lelystad is in the process of implementing climate-adaptive interventions in Lelystad's neighbourhoods. These climate adaptive interventions are also part of the policy to promote Lelystad as the capital of new nature. Therefore, the residents did perceive this policy in their own surroundings. In their view, Lelystad is not the capital of new nature at the moment."
De relatie tussen seksuele straatintimidatie en plaatsgevoel,"['Kempers, Anne']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-09-10T00:00:46Z,NL,['Seksuele; straatintimidatie; jongvolwassen; vrouwen; sense of place; plaatsgevoel; Amsterdam; Indische Buurt'],Human Geography,"In deze thesis is onderzocht hoe seksuele straatintimidatie wordt ervaren door jongvolwassen vrouwen in de Indische Buurt en hoe dit hun plaatsgevoel in de openbare ruimte beïnvloedt. Hiervoor hebben tien respondenten, jongvolwassen vrouwen die woonachtig zijn in de Indische Buurt, een fotodagboek bijgehouden en zijn er semigestructureerde interviews bij de respondenten afgenomen. Hieruit bleek dat de respondenten gevolgen van straatintimidatie ervaren in hun dagelijks leven. Zij passen zich aan, zodat de mogelijkheid dat straatintimidatie plaatsvindt voor hun gevoel afneemt. Voorbeelden van deze aanpassingen zijn het dragen van een koptelefoon, omfietsen en iemand bellen als zij zich in de openbare ruimte bevinden. Dit geeft ze een gevoel van veiligheid in een situatie die bedreigend kan voelen. Hier zit een verschil in de dag en de nacht. In de avond zijn zij banger dat straatintimidatie zou kunnen plaatsvinden, omdat het dan donker en rustig is, waardoor de situatie kan escaleren. Overdag ervaren zij echter vaker straatintimidatie. Dit komt doordat zij overdag hun gedrag minder aanpassen, omdat straatintimidatie dan minder beangstigend voelt, maar voornamelijk als irritant en vervelend wordt ervaren.
Er is een relatie tussen de ervaringen van straatintimidatie en het plaatsgevoel. Deze relatie is echter zeer complex. De ontwikkeling van een plaatsgevoel is namelijk een complex en genuanceerd proces. Het is een proces wat contextafhankelijk is, van de plaats, de tijd en van positieve en negatieve associaties. Er is een relatie tussen de ervaringen van straatintimidatie en het plaatsgevoel, maar hoe deze relatie precies in elkaar zit is lastig te beschrijven.
De respondenten passen namelijk hun gedrag aan, als gevolg van straatintimidatie, maar zij ervaren dit niet als een belemmering. Zij passen zich aan omdat zij zich daar prettiger bij voelen. Dat er plekken in de buurt zijn die zij mijden, doen zij uit automatisme, zonder actief na te denken dat dit een gevolg van straatintimidatie is. Verder hebben de respondenten third places in de buurt, waar zij zich veilig en thuis voelen en waar mensen komen met wie zij zich identificeren. De respondenten weten als het waren precies waar zij wel en niet moeten komen om prettig in de buurt te kunnen wonen en leven. De aanpassingen zien zij niet als een belemmering omdat hun gehele leven hiernaar is ingericht. Dit is zó normaal voor de respondenten, dat zij niet het gevoel hebben dat hun plaatsgevoel wordt beïnvloed door seksuele straatintimidatie."
"Greening strategies, participatory planning and liveability","['Paap, Anne']","['Frantzeskaki, Niki']",2022-09-10T00:00:41Z,EN,['urban planning; participatory planning; greening strategies; liveability'],Spatial Planning,"Recent developments indicate that greenery, participation, and liveability require increasing attention. The pandemic showed that a green environment is important for both mental health and physical health (Uchiyama & Kohsaka, 2020). Participation on the other hand, plays an important role in the ‘Nieuwe Omgevingswet’ (Gieling & Haartsen, 2016). The liveability of cities becomes more and more important due to the increasing city population (Ritchie & Roser, 2019). To be able to improve the liveability by using greening strategies and participatory planning, it is needed to gain more knowledge of the relation between these three elements. Therefore, this research aims to answer the following research question: ‘How and to what extend do greening strategies and participatory planning in the neighbourhood Geuzenveld in Amsterdam contribute to improving its liveability?’ 

In this research, the neighbourhood Geuzenveld, located in Amsterdam, is used as a case study. The focus is on this neighbourhood because here participatory planning and greening strategies have already been used in practice to improve the liveability. During this research, different methods are used to gather the findings. First, document analysis was performed on seventeen documents varying from the global to local level to get insight into the planning context. Furthermore, fifteen people are interviewed, some of whom were residents and some who were involved as a professional in the neighbourhood. This was to gain on the one hand insight into the experience of the residents and on the other hand how the professionals contribute to the liveability in Geuzenveld. Lastly, observations have been done to see what the greenery actually looks like and how it is used. 

The findings of this study generally correspond to what was expected from the literature. Unfortunately, there is not found a clear direct relationship between the three elements (participatory planning, greening strategies, and liveability). However, it has been found that greenery can indeed contribute to improving liveability. This is especially the case when a green environment is seen as important by the residents. Furthermore, the residents have the opportunity to participate in different ways and participation can at least indirectly contribute to liveability because it provides insights into the requirements of the residents. To get an even better insight into the effect of participatory planning and greening strategies on liveability, it is recommended to do more extensive research that both uses surveys and interviews as research methods."

PREDICTING THE TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT FOR UNIVERSITIES' TWITTER FEEDS,"['Martínez Vidal, Paula']","['Nguyen, Dennis']",2022-09-09T04:03:19Z,EN,[],Applied Data Science,"Many studies show how to engage with audiences on social media, but a lack of studies shows how universities use social media accounts in the scientific research domain. Therefore, based on the research gap, the present study aims to contribute to the field of predicting the most probable type of engagement (like, retweet, or reply) for ten university official Twitter accounts. Moreover, the study also proposes to find some of the features contributing to this prediction. In order to predict the type of interaction, the research uses a combination of human- selected and machine-extracted features to train three machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Classifier, and LightGBM) and a deep learning model (neural network using BERT model). Human selected features are mainly binary variables that contain tweet information, while machine-extracted features are large-dimensional features that we obtain from the texts of the tweets. The results show that by combining both types of features, we can predict the most probable type of engagement and an overview of the features that contribute to this prediction, such as if the tweet contains a hashtag or if the tweet is a reply. Also, the findings show that the best method to predict this engagement is LightGBM and neural networks.
Research and practical implications include helping practitioners to create the content strategy based on the engagement objectives and providing more knowledge to help them understand which features contribute to the type of engagement."
Decreasing Teenage Readership Rates in Lithuania: Exploring Causes and Suggesting Solutions,"['Petrauskas, Laurynas']","['Salman, Jeroen']",2022-09-10T00:00:34Z,EN,[],Literatuur vandaag,"Over the past years, Lithuania has faced a dramatic decrease in teenage readership
rates, urging a circumstantial investigation of the causes. Previous research has explored the
issue only by interviewing teenagers themselves and has thus overlooked the potential of an
objective evaluation of the situation from a professional vantage, for example, that of
teachers. This thesis conducts both quantitative and qualitative research. It examines the main
causes of such high lack of interest in reading amongst Lithuanian teenagers through a
questionnaire distributed amongst students and a set of open-ended questions for teachers. In
contrast to what has been assumed in the hypothesis, the stringent curriculum is not the main
cause of the decline in readership numbers. The main causes of the decline in teenage
readership rates, this thesis shows, depend on other factors, such as poor concentration, low
text comprehension skills, and the severe impact of modern technologies."

For example, it appears that feelings of loneliness are stronger among residents of low socio-economic neighbourhoods than in neighbourhoods where the socio-economic status is higher. This master thesis, therefore, looked at the degree to which spaces of encounter and the type of encounters that might take place within these spaces influence feelings of loneliness among adult residents. A qualitative case study by means of walkalong and face-to-face semi-structured interviews was carried out in combination with a mapping assignment within the Rotterdam neighbourhood of Bospolder-Tussendijken. 
	This study has shown that the type of encounters that take place within the different spaces of encounter influence the feelings of loneliness among adult residents of low socio-economic neighbourhoods. However, the social environment of low socio-economic neighbourhoods also has a strong influence on the type of encounters. This is because certain social habits, power relations and the degree of social cohesion are present, which cause social exclusion within various spaces of encounter. Moreover, this has an impact on feelings of loneliness among residents because people cannot meet each other in the desired places and manners. However, personal characteristics seem to have more influence on feelings of loneliness than the spaces and types of encounters within low socio-economic neighbourhoods. And finally, it appears that micro-publics are often the places where people who feel lonely go to tackle these feelings. These micro-publics also turn out to play an important role in breaking the social habits that are rooted in the neighbourhood."
Algorithmic Fairness: which algorithm suits my purpose?,"['Woudstra, Fenna']","['Qahtan, Hakim']",2022-09-17T00:00:42Z,EN,['algorithmic fairness; machine learning; bias; bias mitigation'],Artificial Intelligence,"Machine learning (ML) algorithms are widely used in decision-making tasks. These decisions can have a big impact on the lives of people. Therefore, it is important that the outcomes of ML models are fair and do not lead to discrimination. Unfair outcomes could be a result of societal biases reflected in the assigned class labels, biases that arise during the data collection and processing, or the design choices made within an algorithm. Over the last decade, the topic of fairness in machine learning has become an important area of research that has led to many bias mitigation algorithms. These algorithms have shown to perform differently on different datasets. For this reason, data profiling can give a better understanding of the effectiveness of various bias mitigation algorithms. In this thesis, we analyzed sixteen bias mitigation algorithms and identified several characteristics of the data that help to decide which algorithm should be used for a given dataset to improve fairness. Based on that, we developed a Fair Algorithm Selection Tool (FairAST), that inspects the data and recommends the optimal algorithm to improve a given fairness measure. The experimental evaluation shows that, to a great extent, these recommendations are in line with the best performing algorithms found through exhaustive search."

However, although the newer techniques seem promising, it is not always clear when and why one feature extractor may outperform another. The aim of this study is to examine if state-of-the-art feature extractors (i.e., transformers like RoBERTa, MPNET, and SPECTER) can outperform classical feature extractors (i.e., tf-idf and Doc2Vec) when classifying systematic reviews as relevant or irrelevant. The study involved running multiple simulations with the ASReview software to see how well the different feature extractors (in combination with various classifiers) classified research articles as relevant or irrelevant. The results indicated that a tf-idf feature extractor, in combination with a Naive Bayes classifier, outperformed all other combinations, including the sentence transformer feature extractors."

Online One-Way Trading with Machine Learned Advice,"['Heinsbroek, Mark']","['Liu, Alison']",2022-09-19T23:00:32Z,EN,['Online Algorithms; Machine Learned Advice; One-way Trading;'],Computing Science,"In the one-way trading problem, a player is presented with a number of rates. For each rate the player needs to decide if they want to trade, and how much of their budget they want to trade for a profit. This trade will be done according to the rate currently available to the player. The goal of the player is to maximise the profit they make on the sum of all trades. The discussed algorithm for one-way trading uses a semi-online environment. More specifically, the number of rates that will be presented is known and the bounds on the minimum and the maximum exchange rates are also known.

In this work, the online one-way trading algorithm is extended so that it can use a piece of advice that is given before the algorithm starts. This advice will influence the performance of the algorithm. More precisely, the effect on the performance will depend on the error of the advice and on the trust that is put in the advice.
With advice that has no error, the algorithm can achieve the optimal amount of profit. Depending on how big the error is, the algorithm that uses advice can perform worse than the original online algorithm that doesn't use advice. In this work, two different kinds of advice are tested. The best day to trade on and the highest rate that will be presented.

With the advice tested in this work, one-way trading with perfect advice will always be as good or better than one-way trading without advice. When the presented number of rates is large the online algorithm with advice can outperform the standard online algorithm, even with a significant error in the advice. This is especially true for the advice that predicts the best day to trade on."

It studies the mission “disconnecting 1.5 million existing homes from natural gas by 2030”, which finds it origin in the Dutch Climate Agreement and the Integral Knowledge and Innovation Agenda (IKIA). This mission falls under the overarching mission for the built environment, known as Mission B: A carbon-neutral built environment in 2050 (Taakgroep Innovatie, 2019; Klimaatakkoord, 2019). 

By following the five analytical steps of the MIS framework, (1) problem-solution diagnosis, (2) structural analysis, (3) functional analysis, (4) systemic barrier analysis, and (5) reflection (planned) mission governance actions, and by giving specific focus in these steps on the mission governance structure and its influences, the following research questions was answered: “To what extent are the mission governance actions and mission governance structure adequately targeted on resolving the systemic barriers present in the Dutch Mission-oriented Innovation System of the built environment?”. A qualitative research approach was chosen, and data was collected through 30 interviews with various stakeholders involved in the studied mission, desk research of policy documents, academic literature, reports, and relevant websites, and by consulting experts within the internship organisation.

Based on the data analysis, a total of six systemic barriers and their interrelatedness with weak system functions were identified: (i) municipalities experience difficulties in fulfilling their governing role in the district-oriented approach, (ii) missing central steering on the execution of the mission, (iii) bias for technological development and innovation, (iv) fragmented character built environment sector, (v) innovations experience difficulties in scaling up, (vi) difficulty in mobilising homeowners to take sustainable measures. The assessment of the adequateness of the (planned) mission governance actions targeting the these identified barriers showed that although some barriers are addressed by mission governance actions, its effectiveness remains questionable. To improve the adequateness and effectiveness of the mission governance actions, recommendations and focus point have been proposed which should be incorporated or address in (re)designing policy. Furthermore, to minimise the effects the governance structure has on the progress of the mission, it is crucial to improve the coordination, interplay, and feedback mechanisms between the different levels (local, regional, national)."
"Qualitative comparison of the preprocessing pipelines of the inferior
cerebellar peduncle in pre-operative
paediatric oncology data","['Rakitina, Dasha']","['Tax, Chantal']",2022-09-23T00:00:28Z,EN,"['Diffusion weighted imaging, cerebellar mutism syndrome, cerebellum, pre-processing, posterior fossa tumours, ExploreDTI, FSL']",Medical Imaging,"Cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) arises in some patients after the surgical removal of posterior fossa tumours. The complications include speech retardation, emotional lability, various mobility impairments and developmental delays. Even though this form of cancer makes up a big part of the mortality rates in paediatric oncology, the evidence for what causes the CMS complication is still generally unknown. 

The clinical interest in cerebellar investigation relies onto differentiating anatomical properties influencing CMS pathogenesis. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of a cerebellar region can help to identify the areas, which contribute to the development of CMS. Being based on the principle of diffusion anisotropy, this technique can provide an overview of the connectivity and volumes of white matter regions in the brain. After minimising artefacts and performing the registration, a cerebellar region can be investigated with fiber tractography. The tract of interest, which in the case of this project is the inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP), is segmented. Then parameters like mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) can be acquired as quantitative markers of white matter microstructural differences. Along with the segmented tract profiles, obtained FA and MD can be compared between the two groups: patients who developed CMS and who did not. Identifying the regions that contribute to the development of CMS can be used when considering the risks of CMS development in surgical planning. 

This report compares two pre-processing pipelines, aiming to choose the more suitable one considering the presence of the tumour. It discusses the challenges associated with the visualisation of tracts near the cerebellum and sources of errors and proposes improvements that could be considered in terms of the future development of the project. It also describes the outcomes of a deterministic tractography method used for segmentation of the inferior cerebellar peduncle. 

The study concluded that the FSL pre-processing pipeline resulted in more visual improvements in a particular cohort than the pre-processing performed in ExploreDTI. However, the reliability of tractography results was lowered due to the presence of remaining artefacts. Therefore, further pipeline development is required before the segmentation of ICP and assessment of tractography parameters can make it possible to discover reasons for CMS development."
Perception of Farmers on Reforestation of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest - The case from the Alto Paranapanema Watershed,"['Ramos Nardy, Julia']","['Verburg, René']",2022-09-22T00:00:50Z,EN,['perception; farmers; alto paranapanema watershed; brazilian atlantic forest; forest restoration; deforestation'],Sustainable Development,"The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF) is an ecological hotspot, and nowadays only 11,4% to 16% of the 
native vegetation is left, in which most of its remaining forest patches are small and disconnected from 
each other. Of the native vegetation left, 64% is within rural private properties, that are mainly used for 
agriculture – a key economic sector for Brazil’s GDP. This entails that rural property owners are key 
actors to ensuring the connectivity of the remaining forest patches of the BAF through forest 
conservation, preservation, and restoration – necessary measures to ensure that the extinction threshold 
of this forest is not surpassed. To further understand what the possible drivers and barriers for these 
actors to ensure the forest perpetuity are, it is important to assess what are their perceptions (shaped by 
socio-economic factors) on reforestation. To assess this, this study focused on the Alto Paranapanema 
watershed, located in the southeast of the state of São Paulo, in the southeast of Brazil. This watershed 
is a multi-functional landscape with forests, agriculture, industries, and people. 381 farmers from the 
watershed participated on a survey developed by the author, in which the answers were assessed by 
means of a quantitative analysis. Findings suggest that the watershed accounts for three different clusters 
of farmers, in which they differ due to their different socio-economic characteristics and perceptions. 
Nonetheless, they also have common perceptions and characteristics and overall, they understand the 
benefits of having forests – both for their personal lives, and for their farming practices. Nevertheless, 
they would be more willing to reforest and maintain forests within their properties if they were to be 
compensated by market strategies, or if they were to receive the benefits entailed in the Forest Act."
A Walk with the Future: the long-term in planning,"['Dijk, Jaimy van']","['Pelzer, Peter']",2022-09-22T00:00:48Z,EN,['long-term; planning; experiential futures; futures literacy; dramaturgy'],Spatial Planning,"The sustainability challenges of the 21st century, like climate change and biodiversity loss, require a long-term future perspective. By definition, planners are concerned with the future, or at least they should be. Observable pressing challenges in the present currently dominate over the sustainability challenges for which the effects are reflected in the long-term future. A planner can engage with the future with different methods, like visioning or scenario planning. The time horizon of these methods is often focused on 30 years into the future in line with policy goals, like the Paris Climate Agreement (2050). However, the effects of current sustainability challenges encompass beyond a lifetime. Although the future is inherently uncertain, planners need to anticipate on it. For that purpose, I explored how planners can engage with the long-term future, that covers at least 100 years. 

I used an action- research approach for the design of an intervention. The result is the empirical case, called the Soggy Paths. The Soggy Paths is a walk through time in which the changing paths of the Dutch living environment are explored. In close collaboration with practitioners, I experimented with the design in three different contexts. The first context was the creative environment of Springtij Forum where the focus was on facilitation of procedural and substantive interventions to stimulate the imagination. The second context of the learning environment of the Mixed Classroom explored the substantive interventions more in-depth with an additional focus on learning. Combining the insights of the previous two experiments, led to the experimentation in an actual planning context, a policy process with a wicked problem at stake: the Transitional areas. With these three experimentations I deepened and refined the design and at the same time demonstrated how the design worked in different contexts.

From the three experiments I learned that the most important value of the Soggy Paths time walk is the facilitation of a different conversation about the long-term future. The soft space allows to discuss and learn from the different perspectives. The interactive element is a crucial design feature in that sense. With the comparison of the three cases, I made four reflections that can contribute to an improvement of the design and inspire other procedural undertakings for an engagement with the long-term future. The first reflection was to leave the script as open as possible; the second to facilitate a conversation about a desirable future; the third relates to the facilitation of the reflection and the fourth reflection emphasized the importance of an immersive experience. 

The impact of these kinds of intervention is often questioned. A better understanding of the indicated learning outcomes is object for future research. More importantly, more research should be directed to how to use these kind of interventions in actual planning cases, in order for a better sustainable future to arise."
Does size matter?

However, current techniques for applying such stimulation are limited to in vitro studies due to the need for direct contact with mechanical apparatuses. This study investigates the mechanical properties and magnetic responsiveness of melt electrowriting (MEW) processed thermoplastic/graphene/iron oxide composite single fibres. The diameter of printed fibres was hypothesised to alter these characteristics, in line with previous research of micrometre scale single fibres. The homogenous incorporation of magnetic particles was observed to significantly increase the elastic modulus of mould-casted and 80 µm printed fibres. Interestingly, the elastic modulus and ultimate tensile stress of 20 µm printed fibres was significantly greater than that of larger fibres for magnetic and non-magnetic thermoplastic polymers. The magnetic responsiveness of printed fibres in magnetic fields less than 350 mT, as quantified by deflection, was shown to scale inversely with fibre diameter. Fibres of 20 µm achieved maximum deflections in the range of 23 mm, while fibres of 80 µm showed deflections in the range of 1.2 mm for the same magnetic field strength. Furthermore, a significant difference between increasing and decreasing magnetic field strength sweeps was identified for all printed fibre diameters, whereby deflections were greater following fibres having experienced the maximum field strength and thus, maximum deflection. Overall, these results highlight the potential for magnetically responsive scaffold fabrication via MEW processing with mechanical properties and magnetic actuation which are tuneable with fibre diameter."

The study concerns implementation of DeepMind’s Deep Generative Model of Rainfall (DGMR) to data about rainfall in the Netherlands gathered in Nationale Regenradar. DGMR is a nowcasting method which allows to forecast precipitation within the lead time of 90 minutes, based on an input of data referring to 20 minutes. In the research, data for summer, extreme precipitation events was used as an input of the model. Thirteen such events were chosen in consultation with a meteorologist from Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut (KNMI). The study’s results show that the DGMR proves applicable to the NRR data and this analysis can be used as a proof of concept for further research. Two research questions were addressed: model’s performance in nowcasting precipitation of convective or partly convective type, and, change of nowcast’s accuracy with increasing lead time. The results of the study approve that convective rainfall is more difficult for the model to nowcast than a mixed type one.

Dertigers doorgelicht: De verschillen tussen het Vlaamse origineel en de Nederlandse remake,"['Saane, Mijntje van']","['Keilbach, Judith']",2022-06-11T00:00:41Z,EN,"['remake, format, televisieformat, cultural proximity']",Film- en Televisiewetenschap,"In deze masterthesis wordt onderzoek gedaan naar de Vlaamse serie Dertigers (VRT, Warner Bros, ITVP) en haar gelijknamige Nederlandse remake (BNNVARA, Hollands Licht). Deze thesis zal een diepgaande comparatieve tekstuele analyse bieden die de verschillen en overeenkomsten tussen beide versies aan het licht brengt. De analyse laat allereerst zien wat de verschillen en overeenkomsten in mise-en-scène en cinematografie tussen de series zijn. Daarnaast onderzoek ik drie belangrijke thema’s uit de serie en hoe deze benaderd worden in beide versies.
In eerste instantie beweerde de toonaangevende wetenschappelijke theorie over televisieformats dat het lokale publiek voorkeur geeft aan content die lokaal en herkenbaar aanvoelt. Dit houdt in dat het gesproken wordt in de eigen taal, op een herkenbare locatie en dat er personen te zien zijn die men herkent of die uit eigen land/regio komen. Verder hebben regio’s voorkeuren wat betreft genre, thema’s en esthetiek. Volgens deze theorie zouden Vlaanderen en Nederland producties kunnen uitwisselen, omdat de markten een culturele en historische achtergrond delen en bovendien geografisch nabij zijn. Toch wordt er regelmatig voor gekozen om Vlaamse producties opnieuw te produceren en te lokaliseren voor Nederland en andersom. Het lokaliseren van een format is een complex proces waarbij veel verschillende factoren een rol spelen die van invloed zijn op de uitwerking van de productie. Vergelijkend onderzoek naar het origineel en de remake biedt inzicht in de producties en hoe deze zich tot elkaar verhouden. Om te onderzoeken hoe het format van Dertigers is aangepast aan het Nederlandse publiek, zal de volgende onderzoekvraag beantwoord worden: Op welke manieren is de Vlaamse serie Dertigers aangepast in de Nederlandse remake van de serie? Aan de hand van codes die mediawetenschapper Albert Moran identificeert, worden verschillende elementen uit de series geanalyseerd en met elkaar vergeleken. Deze elementen zijn onder andere locaties, kleur- en lichtgebruik, taal, personages, cameragebruik en montage. Aanvullend worden aan de hand van drie scènes drie belangrijke thema’s uit de serie onderzocht: de weergave van een homoseksuele relatie, de portrettering van een alleenstaande moeder en de problematisering van drugsgebruik. Onderzoek naar deze thema’s bieden inzicht in hoe deze benaderd worden in beide versies van de serie en hoe de Nederlandse makers het origineel hebben aangepast."

Drawing on writing within the field of queer theory, feminist studies, and the newly emerging asexuality studies, I will embark on a queer scavenger hunt for traces and resonances of asexuality in the Netherlands. This will be a queer undertaking, that is also deeply personal, taking on the feminist notion that the personal is political. First, we will explore Dutch sexusociety and its specificities, unearthing three dominant normative strains within this sexual discourse: the adherence to the normal, the dominance of the normalized homosexual, and the pervasiveness of homonationalism. Then, we will take on the COC and critically inquire why it refuses to include asexuality in its organization. After this, the queer scavenger hunt continues within the Netherlands, digging through feminist and LGBTQ+ archives for traces and resonances of asexuality, finding these resonances in the spinster and the Boston marriage. Further on this scavenger hunt, I will explore how asexuality is represented in the public domain and is understood amongst the Dutch LGBTQ+ community. Finally, I embark on a quest beyond the horizon, in a search for an asexual futurity that could break with the pervasiveness of sexual futurity. I propose an allegiance of queer and trans grassroots organizations with asexual activists, to reimagine and reconfigure conversations on desires, intimacies, sexuality, and relationships outside of sex."

This research aimed to examine the mediating effect of loneliness between participating in sports activities and life satisfaction among adolescents. The present study based its findings on data collected in three waves from the YOUth Got Talent project. There was a total of 219 participants in this study, 55.7 % females and 41.3% males, with a mean age of 17.8. Single item of whether the participants were involved in a sports club was used to assess the participation in sports activities variable. The UCLA Loneliness Scale was used to assess for loneliness, and adaptation of Cantril Ladder’s Life Satisfaction Scale was used to assess life satisfaction of the participants. Results showed that participation in sports activities did not significantly predict life satisfaction among adolescents, and participation in sports activities did not significantly predict loneliness. Loneliness significantly predicted life satisfaction. However, there was no mediation effect found for loneliness between participation in sports activities and life satisfaction."

richest, most resilient and least degraded in the Caribbean, but they are not escaping the global 
degrading trend in coral reefs. Identifying and combatting local stressors, increases the resilience to 
global stressors. Research has shown that even the deeper, relatively unexplored reefs, mesophotic 
coral ecosystems (MCE), ranging from 30 to 150m in depth, are being impacted by anthropogenic 
disturbances. As the MCEs start where Scuba diving stops, and submersibles are often too costly, this 
study deployed an ROV to explore and monitor the shallow (5-20m) and the upper-mesophotic (40-
60m) reefs at eight sites along the leeward coast of Bonaire. These sites were subdivided into different 
zones, showing a gradient in human impact and water quality. The imagery obtained by the ROV is of 
adequate quality, allowing for identification to genus level if not species level, and showed comparable 
results in estimated percentage coral cover with other recent studies. The benthic community 
composition changed along the vertical (depth) and horizontal (human impact and water quality) 
gradient. Benthic cyanobacterial mats were found around 40-60m depth, covering large parts of the 
ocean floor. Hard and soft corals, sponges, macroalgae and crustose coralline algae occurred at 40m 
depth at six of the eight monitored sites, indicating the presence of MCEs, and only at one site 
(Karpata), hard corals were present at 60m depth. Coral cover showed a clear increasing trend with 
decreasing human impact, addressing the need for a better understanding of heterogeneity among 
sites and local conservation measures. Developments in underwater robotics and machine learning 
enable more research on these hidden coral reefs and identification of the effect of local stressors on 
MCEs."

biedt een populatie aan van potentiële succescases. Hierna worden aan de hand van het trechtermodel
(funnel framework) – een quickscan tool dat het mogelijk maakt om op een hanteerbare valide manier
succesvol geacht bestuur te beoordelen – twee cases getoetst. Dit zijn het nationaal topsportbeleid en
het Groninger Forum. Het gebruiken en becommentariëren van het trechtermodel leidt tot een
aangescherpte versie. Het tweede deel van dit onderzoek is een verdiepend onderzoek dat zich richt op
caseniveau en behelst het systematisch evalueren en verklaren van de abortuswetgeving. Voor het
beoordelen wordt gebruik gemaakt van een analytisch instrumentarium: het PPPE-model. Uit de
evaluatieve analyse blijkt dat de abortuswetgeving als beleidssucces kan worden gekwalificeerd.
Vervolgens wordt op kwalitatieve interpretatieve wijze de duurzame werkzaamheid van de uit 1981
stammende abortuswetgeving verklaard. Uit deze verklarende analyse komt naar voren dat de Wet

behavioral responses, especially during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, citizens’
trust for The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany throughout different phases of the pandemic will be 
researched using Eggers et al.’s (2021) model for building trust in the government. This explorative and
comparative analysis of a variety of datasets provides a high-level snapshot overview of the differences 
between the countries’ approaches to cushion the social, financial and health issues due to the pandemic. 
The research question for this study is ‘How do policies, measures and trust signals in the media relate to 
citizens’ trust in Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands throughout different phases of the pandemic?’. 
Trust signals in the media are studied by a content analysis of the heads of the states’ press conferences 
throughout the pandemic to provide more insight into the narratives from the government.
The research provides provisional conclusions that throughout the pandemic, the countries 
remained around the same level of trust. The Netherlands and Germany saw a comparable trend in trust: 
the highest levels of trust pre-pandemic, and a decline in trust throughout the pandemic. Additionally, 
from the measures, we found no relationship between the timing or strictness of the measures and trust. 
Regarding policies, it was also noticeable that larger spending and a larger variety of policies do not 
relate to trust. Lastly, no relationship was found between the trust signals in speech and citizens’ trust in 
the government.
The findings confirm and further illustrate the complexity of trust. For further research, we 
suggest studying the relationship between trust and the governmental approach through surveys and 
quantitative data. Additionally, it is recommended to research contextual factors such as social media."
"Pumping test analysis performed in the Griftpark’s subsurface, Utrecht, the Netherlands","['Lacoste, Arnaud']","['Faber, Suzanne']",2022-10-13T00:00:35Z,EN,['Pumping test - Heterogeneous porous media - DNAPL contamination'],Earth Surface and Water,"In preparation of a tracer test, a pumping test was performed in a heterogenous and highly contaminated site. The porous media is contaminated with DNAPL that infiltrates the water table. The 1st aquifer of the site is sealed from the sides with bentonite walls and from below with an aquitard composed of several clay layers. However, this bounded aquifer is believed to have leakages through the aquitard where the clay layers are not continuous, notably in the central-east side of the site. During the pumping test, the hydraulic heads of the 1st aquifer, the aquitard, and the 2nd aquifer below the site as well as the 1st aquifer outside the bentonite walls were continuously monitored with divers. Manual measurements were also taken from several Multi-Level Sampling wells to create hydraulic head profiles with depth. The pumping test revealed that the connectivity between the 1st and 2nd aquifer is very weak in the central-east site of the site. The hydraulic separation of the 1st and 2nd aquifer in the central-east side is mainly due to a clay layer located between 54-56m below ground level. The leakages are therefore coming from another location in the aquitard or through a hole somewhere in the bentonite wall. An averaged hydraulic conductivity of the 1st aquifer was also estimated with Stallman’s method based on the data collected during the pumping test. It estimated a diagonal hydraulic conductivity of 12.7m/day. A 14-layer model and two 3-layer models were also created to simulate the hydraulic head reaction of the pumping test. These models were not able to accurately match the hydraulic reaction from the site recorded during the pumping test. As such, a sensitivity analysis testing the hydraulic conductivity of the 1st aquifer, the aquitard, and the bentonite walls considering its thickness were performed to increase the understanding of their impact on groundwater flows at the site."
Who is supposed to save the planet?,"['Jairam, Ishara']","['Bos, Jaap']",2022-10-11T23:01:27Z,EN,[],Social Policy and Public Health,"Individual change and systemic change are both important to combat climate change. Given
that citizen’s concerns dictate how climate policies should be presented, this should be
included in research. Therefore, this research will provide an answer to the question: How
does fear of climate change influences the perception of Dutch citizens on whether they are
responsible or the government is responsible for combatting climate change? This will be
done by performing a T-test, a simple regression analysis and a multiple regression analysis
with the variables 1) fear, 2) individual responsibility and 3) government responsibility. The
results show that fear is positively related to individual responsibility and negatively related to
government responsibility. This remains the same when direct fear and indirect fear are
separated, with a stronger effect for direct fear. That being said, the differences are minor.
Based on these findings, I advise policymakers to enable the Dutch to make personal changes
to combat climate change and focus on the direct impact of climate change. For example, by
making organic food available at supermarkets and placing second-hand shops in local
shopping centres, but also by reporting on the effect of these acts. In addition, the minor
differences found indicate that restoring trust in the government might change preferences
towards systemic change."

Today, a large part of human interaction and relationship building occurs online, often in an informal and colloquial forum. This paper aims to apply the toponym co-occurrence method in a novel way to online conversations in order to determine how well we can to explain the co-occurrence of city names in social media. To this end, we will focus on European cities and the social media website Reddit. There are some difficulties with disambiguation as the name of a city can often take on multiple meanings. We will approach this task in three stages. First, we will explore the data to get a better understanding of toponym co-occurrences. Then we will regression techniques to determine how well the information collected can predict variability in co-occurrence of city names. Finally, we will use unsupervised machine learning techniques to assess how well we can disambiguate between different word senses when searching for toponyms."

In this thesis we review these exciting developments, focusing on the tameness of the period map in Hodge theory and on the proposal of a new conjectured aspect of low-energy effective the- ories arising from quantum gravity, called the Tameness Conjecture. We provide further evidence for the Tameness Conjecture in the setting of higher supergravity theories. In particular, we show that in such theories the geometry of the scalar field space is tame, and we argue for the tameness of gauge couplings functions. We point out several sub- tleties arising from the interaction between tameness and arithmetic aspects."

A further (quantitative) evaluation of the LUSES-model was required before further development and exploration of the model. In addition to this, further model evaluation could add to the knowledge on the use of the socio-psychological Consumat approach in land use ABMs. This thesis resulted in a quantitative evaluation of the LUSES model, providing a validation of the model output and internal validation to the model by assessing the parameter robustness (including interaction effects) and exploring the model assumptions.
The research is built on a literature study of the most relevant concepts for model evaluation. After preparatory analyses, the robustness of the parameters of the LUSES model was assessed by a One-factor-at-a-time sensitivity analysis. A Sobol’ sensitivity analysis was performed to analyse the interaction effects. The system assumptions were explored by analysing alternative scenarios.
The research showed a sensitivity of the model to certain price changes. A large drop of the prices of a crop that used to be steady had extreme effects on almost all output variables: fluctuations and extreme values, especially for more extreme parameter values. The analysis also showed an extreme lack of response to parameter changes in the social need satisfaction variable, though this variable was shown to contribute though interaction effects. The intricacy of this ABM was shown in the Sobol’ analysis, which indicated that all main parameters (directly or indirectly) effect almost all output variables. The Existence need satisfaction variable is most influential taking into account interaction effects, the Aspiration variable is most influential without. No abnormalities were found that could not be explained by taking a closer look at the model logic, though the analysis of the system assumptions showed the model should not be used with settings that deviate from the baseline settings or parameter bounds that were tested in the OFAT analysis.
From this can be concluded that the LUSES-model is very sensitive to price changes. This is influenced by the Cognitive effort variable. The Aspiration and Existence need variables have the strongest influence on the output variance. The model is sound, but the use of parameter settings that deviate from the baseline settings should be attempted with caution."

Steeds meer mensen trokken hierdoor naar natuur- en recreatiegebieden, maar ook na de corona lockdowns is het bezoeken van natuur- en recreatiegebieden een blijvende trend. Dit komt  doordat mensen meer vrije tijd hebben om te recreëren, de bevolkingsgroei stijgt, er is meer vergrijzing en er is een stijgende interesse in gezondheid en bewegen. Het vervoersmiddel waarmee mensen deze natuur- en recreatiegebieden bezoeken is voornamelijk de auto. Deze vorm van mobiliteit is doorgaans niet duurzaam en liggen hier kansen om de mobiliteit te verduurzamen. Ook draagt duurzame mobiliteit aan het halen van de klimaatdoelen van het Klimaatakkoord. De focus van duurzame mobiliteit ligt op het stedelijk gebied en minder op landelijke gebieden en gebieden rondom de stad. Daarom is het relevant om onderzoek te doen naar het verduurzamen van de mobiliteit naar natuur- en recreatiegebieden en hoe dit het beste kan worden gestimuleerd. Hierbij werd de hoofdvraag gesteld: Wat is het huidige reisgedrag van bezoekers van natuur- en recreatiegebied Amelisweerd/Rhijnauwen en hoe kan de verschuiving naar duurzamere mobiliteitsvormen worden gestimuleerd richting dit gebied?

Om dit te onderzoeken werd een gebied gezocht dat relatief dicht bij een stad lag waar recreatiedruk en bevolking groeit. Het aspect relatief dicht bij de stad werd gekozen omdat dan openbaar vervoer nog een reëel alternatief is. In hele landelijke gebieden zijn de openbaar vervoer verbindingen vaak minder frequent dan in stedelijke gebieden en dus een minder reëel alternatief. Zo werd gekozen voor de stad Utrecht en door beperkte tijd van dit onderzoek werd gefocust op één gebied: Amelisweerd/Rhijnauwen. Dit gebied wordt gekenmerkt door de nabije ligging van de stad Utrecht en uit al eerder onderzoek blijkt dat veel mensen hier met de auto dit gebied bezoeken. 

Om te onderzoeken hoe mensen naar natuurgebieden reizen werd in Amelisweerd/Rhijnauwen een enquête afgenomen. Met 136 respondenten kan een beeld worden geschetst van het reisgedrag van de bezoekers. Ook kan met deze antwoorden worden onderzocht welke kenmerken het meest van invloed zijn op duurzaam recreatief reisgedrag en daarmee op welke aspecten het best kan worden ingezet om duurzaam reisgedrag te stimuleren. Aanvullend zijn drie interviews gehouden om van organisaties te horen wat zij al doen op het gebied van stimuleren van duurzame mobiliteit.

Uit de resultaten blijkt dat het recreatieve reisgedrag van bezoekers doorgaans al duurzaam is. Maar liefst 76,5% van de bezoekers heeft het gebied met een duurzaam vervoersmiddel bezocht. Er zijn een aantal kenmerken die bepalend zijn voor het wel of niet uitvoeren van duurzaam recreatief reisgedrag. Autobezit, een grote reisafstand en een hoog inkomen zijn indicators voor minder duurzaam recreatief reisgedrag. Het hebben van de middelen en kennis om  duurzaam reisgedrag uit te voeren helpt ook daadwerkelijk bij het kiezen voor een duurzaam vervoersmiddel. Door met beleidsmaatregelen in te spelen op deze kenmerken kan duurzaam recreatief reisgedrag naar Amelisweerd/Rhijnauwen worden gestimuleerd. Ook door middel van het invoeren van parkeerkosten bij natuur- en recreatiegebieden kan het gebruik van duurzame vervoersmiddelen worden gestimuleerd. Of deze kenmerken in praktijk daadwerkelijk effect hebben zal bij vervolgonderzoek moeten worden onderzocht. Wel kan aan de hand van dit onderzoek worden aanbevolen om te blijven inzetten op goede bereikbaarheid en faciliteiten voor de (elektrische) fiets, aangezien de meeste bezoekers met dit vervoersmiddel een bezoek brengen aan Amelisweerd/Rhijnauwen."

This research refutes the compatibility between the systems regarding non-foundationalism, realism and ultimate truth, and the existence of state-independent properties, mainly due to the differing extent to which Nāgārjuna and Rovelli apply their relationality. However, this research demonstrates that a narrow compatibility can be maintained regarding the understanding of Rovelli’s state-dependent properties through Nāgārjuna’s dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda). These findings further our understanding of RQM and Nāgārjuna, both separately and in relation to one another, and contribute to making sense of how quantum mechanics (and modern science as a whole) relates to Indian thought."

The lower shoreface has been under reviewed and sediment transport and the morphodynamics have been poorly quantified. The study objectives are therefore to quantify the large-scale bed level changes, find the responsible sediment exchanges and validate the transport model results of Grasmeijer et al. (2022). Bathymetric changes based on Vaklodingen between 2019-2017 and transport data between 2013-2017 from Grasmeijer et al. (2022) are combined to study the shoreface of the Dutch Holland coast in different zones (both longshore and depth-dependant cross-shore). The results show flattening of the lower shoreface due to larger net erosion in the shallow part compared to the deeper part. Three sections were identified: an eroding northern section, an accumulating central section and a stable southern section. The modelled transport data shows an increasing total and longshore transport towards the north due to increasing tidal flood dominance (Grasmeijer et al., 2022). The overall onshore-directed cross-shore transport increased towards smaller water depths. The modelled transports were shown to result in longshore and cross-shore exchanges. These are dependent on the transport magnitude, the shoreface width and the vicinity of mega nourishment. The shoreface width modulates the length of the lateral boundaries and seaward boundary is curving so that transport is oblique to this boundary along the majority of the shoreface This results in alongshore sediment exchanges for the different zones. Additionally, bathymetry- and transport-based sediment volume changes are determined and compared. The volumes show almost no resemblance. Possible explanations are inaccuracies of the bathymetric data, the excluded sediment exchange with the upper shoreface and the excluded effect of undertow in the transport model results. Vaklodingen result seem to result in uncertainties so the results must be considered carefully. The combination of bathymetric data and modelled transport data however is a useful method to study the lower shoreface."
How sustainable is sustainable intensification of agriculture?,"['Luft, Claudy']","['Dittgen, Romain']",2022-10-21T23:00:31Z,EN,"['sustainable, intensification, agriculture, impact, gender, livelihood']",International Development Studies,"The concept of sustainable intensification of agriculture has been recognised and promoted as the solution as a sustainable food production for all. Sustainable intensification of agriculture applies a holistic view, including output, economic, environmental, and social aspirations. The concept aims to increase crop production, increase profitability, minimise and decrease damage to the environment, and contribute to become more resilient to shocks and stresses. As a result of this intensification process, (1) farmers' productivity improves, (2) the ecosystem preserves and (3) farmers' livelihood enhances.
Based on this research, the overall impact concludes that the productivity improves. However, the smallholder farmers do experience economic, cognitive, and social barriers while adopting the new farming method of sustainable intensification of their agricultural land. Furthermore, the livelihood of the smallholder farmers faces physical, social, and economic barriers which constrain farmers from cultivating with the intensified technique. Besides, there are assets that enhance livelihood as gained knowledge and improved soil quality. But throughout the whole project gender dynamics are present. Gender roles are culturally unequal in the Rwandan agricultural sector, and this influences the involvement of women in the process of sustainable intensification of agriculture. Diverse influencing factors reoccurred throughout analysing the data, such as more required inputs, low access to finance, and unstable crop market prices. These factors correspond to the improved outputs of the smallholder farmers and their livelihood enhancement.
Overall, the effects of sustainable intensification of agriculture are very diverse and are, therefore, in line with the highly heterogeneous nature of smallholder farmers. But above all, it can be stated that, even though Rwandan smallholder farmers do not have full authority over their decisions, this study examined that the effects of the potato value chain program are positive when focusing on productivity. The unanticipated consequences may reduce the chance of a sustainable long-term adoption and decrease the resilience of most smallholder farmers."

It is considered to be a solution to the phenomenon of the science-practice divide that has been observed in the field of conservation. Considering the high decline in coral reefs, applying successful research uptake could be: (1) an advantageous way to increase the success of conservation and restoration efforts and (2) an attempt to sensitise governments, local communities and civil society over the importance and urgency on the conservation of coral reefs globally.

Preliminary study on the topic identified that NGOs appear to play critical roles both in the conservation of coral reefs but also on the transmission of scientific knowledge. The central question posed for this research is: What are the conditions for optimal uptake of scientific knowledge by NGOs in the specific context of coral reef management?”. This question was answered through the lens of relevant NGOs’ experiences with the process of research uptake. Twenty-five interviews were conducted with NGOs that are active in almost all coral reef locations globally. To explore their experiences, the framework provided by the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom government was used. The data gathered through the interviews were transcribed, coded, and further delineated during the research.

The findings of this research suggest that the conditions for optimised research uptake should be addressed in two different categories: (1) conditions related to the process of research uptake and (2) conditions not related to the process of research uptake. Concerning the process-related category, four main propositions are made. Firstly, the use of clear agreements between the collaborators. Secondly, the pre-existence of internal academia capacity building on research uptake. Thirdly, the customisation of communication needs based on each individual case and lastly, the establishment of a simple, low resource usage monitoring framework. At the same time, significant importance is suggested to be given to conditions not related to the process directly. Firstly, it is suggested to adopt a same-level approach between academia and NGOs, at the core of which will be respect and mutual acknowledgement. Secondly, it is proposed as necessary to customise the research uptake approach based on the different types of roles and collaborations that align with the needs and objectives they entail. Thirdly, it is essential for academia to understand the multiple benefits that capacity building toward NGOs can have for both parties and to act in accordance with that. Finally, this process should be approached in a long-term partnership mindset rather than a one-time exchange. Those conditions, as well as other significant findings and interesting points of discussion are further delineated in the present report."
Clinical outcomes in patients with renal impairment and therapeutic dalteparin treatment,"['Buijsse, Nathan']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-07-22T00:01:25Z,EN,[],Geneeskunde,"Introduction: To prevent bio-accumulation of low molecular weight heparins in patients with decreased kidney function, dosage reduction and anti-Xa monitoring is recommended. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between adjusted and non-adjusted dosage of therapeutic dalteparin with clinical outcomes (major bleedings, thrombosis and mortality) 

Methods: In this monocentric retrospective observational study, we recruited patients with renal impairment who received treatment with a therapeutic dosage of dalteparin without monitoring of anti-Xa levels clinically admitted between January 2012 and March 2022. Included patients were divided over two groups according to the amount of daily administered international units dalteparin per kilogram. Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to estimate hazard ratios to investigate the association between adjusted tDTP and clinical outcomes. Follow-up time for major bleedings and thrombosis was seven days after discontinuation of tDTP treatment or discharge and three months after discharge for mortality. 

Results: 108 patients with a therapeutic dosage of dalteparin and renal impairment were included in our study, of which 31 (28.4%) received an adjusted dosage and 77 (71.6%) a non-adjusted dose. Major bleedings occurred in 12 patients (11.1%); thrombosis in 0 patients (0%); and 25 patients (23.1%) died during follow-up. The mean follow-up for major bleedings was 12 days (IQR 7-17); 13 days (IQR 8-18) for thrombosis; and 100 days (IQR 94-111) for mortality. No association was seen between dosage of therapeutic dalteparin and clinical endpoints. 

Conclusion: Dosage reduction of therapeutic Dalteparin in patients with renal impairment was not associated with a decreased risk for major bleedings, thrombosis and mortality"

Participanten vulden een online vragenlijst in over persoonlijke, relationele en seksuele ontwikkelingstrajecten. Bij 10.3% (n = 78) was sprake van een vroeg seksueel debuut. Middels mediatieanalyses via PROCESS bleek dat kwaliteit van de ouder-kindrelatie positief samenhing met globale zelfwaardering en negatief met een vroeg seksueel debuut. Daarentegen bleek psychologische controle negatief gerelateerd aan globale zelfwaardering en positief aan een vroeg seksueel debuut. De relatie tussen zowel kwaliteit van de ouder-kindrelatie als de mate van psychologische controle enerzijds en een vroeg seksueel debuut anderzijds kon echter niet worden verklaard door globale zelfwaardering.

Through this referendum, Britons were to decide whether or not the UK should continue its membership of the European Union. The political campaigns that preceded the referendum evoked debates surrounding immigration. The Leave campaign argued that exiting the EU would allow the UK to take back control over its borders and protect the country against incoming migrants, hereby appealing to the concerns over immigration prevalent amongst the British public. Considering the devastating consequences anti-immigration attitudes and policies have for people that seek a safe place to reside, the question of how these attitudes come about is of particular concern. It has often been suggested that the representation of social groups in the media plays a significant role in the public attitudes towards those groups (e.g. Héricourt & Spielvogel, 2014; van Klingeren et al., 2015). In the run up to the Brexit referendum, British news media extensively covered topics related to immigration, hereby providing representations of RASIM. This study examined these representations through a Critical Discourse Analysis (Fairclough, 1989) that focused on the textual, discursive and social dimensions of the discourse under study. The different ideological stances that The Guardian and The Daily Mail took with regards to the Brexit provided the opportunity to examine the representations and link them to the sociocultural context in which they were generated. It was found that The Guardian represented RASIM as a heterogenic group while providing more detailed information on people’s personal stories. It also employed strategies that to a certain extent led to the victimization of RASIM. The Daily Mail, on the other hand, represented RASIM as a more homogenic group. It put RASIM’s legitimacy to question and contributed to the collective criminalization of RASIM. Overall, The Daily Mail’s representation created a more negative image of RASIM. This may have evoked more negative stances towards immigration among the public, which may have indirectly contributed to the fact that the UK eventually voted Leave on the referendum. Both newspapers’ representations were exemplary of the way in which dominant Western discourses have the power represent minority groups as Others, and to reinforce already existing narratives, hereby carrying out ownership over the discursive construction of RASIM. A limitation of this study is that it did not investigate the causal relationship between people’s news consumption of representations of RASIM and their attitudes towards RASIM. Therefore, for future research, the further investigation of this relationship through cognitive/psycholinguistic approaches was suggested."

Over deze periode wordt verondersteld dat in het parlement een stilzwijgende consensus heerste over de Europese integratie. Deze stilzwijgende consensus zal stand houden tot in de jaren negentig. De komst van de Europese Unie had als gevolg dat het parlement sceptischer werd, met als gevolg dat de stilzwijgende consensus verdween. Echter, wanneer gekeken wordt naar de parlementaire debatten over de Europese monetaire integratie komt een ander beeld van het parlement naar voren. Wanneer het parlement geconfronteerd werd met de politieke realiteit van het integratieproces, liet het parlement zien het niet altijd eens te zijn met de koers van de monetaire integratie. Hoe duidelijker deze Europese realiteit voor Nederland werd in de jaren tachtig, hoe meer sceptische elementen terugkomen in het parlementaire debat. Door het Europese idealisme in het parlement werd de verdere Europese integratie in de jaren zeventig en tachtig nog doorgezet, maar er was in deze jaren geen sprake meer van een stilzwijgende consensus."

Tracking Psychological Flexibility in College Students with the Psy-flex and Choice Point: Reliability and Validity,"['Jongste, David']","['Schok, Michaela']",2022-07-23T00:02:17Z,EN,['Psychological flexibility ; Psy-flex ; Choice Point intervention ; questionnaire study ; academic procrastination ; college students'],Clinical Psychology,"Abstract 
Introduction. Research indicates that psychological flexibility is an important component of mental health. However, used measures for psychological flexibility suffer from several limitations. Considering these shortcomings, a new measure for psychological flexibility is developed, the Psy-flex. The aim of this study was to investigate the Psy-flex as an adequate assessment tool to measure psychological flexibility and change after an intervention, the Choice Point, in the population of college students.
Method. A mixed-method design was used, consisting of a questionnaire study for the first part and an intervention for the second part. The target sample for the questionnaire study consisted of 128 college students, whereas two participants completed the intervention. A quantitative data- analysis was conducted to assess the reliability and the validity of the Psy-flex and a qualitative text-analysis was used to analyze the answers to evaluation questions regarding the intervention.
Results. The results of the quantitative data-analysis indicated that the Psy-flex was a reliable and valid measure for psychological flexibility. The qualitative data indicated that all core processes were used during the intervention. For participant 2 progress in the processes values and committed action were made after the Choice Point intervention and perceived academic procrastination was reduced.
Discussion. The present study indicated that the Psy-flex is an adequate tool for measuring psychological flexibility in the population of college students. Given its association with psychopathological problems and well-being, the Psy-flex can be used as a screening tool for ACT in the clinical setting. Future research should explore the underlying mechanisms of psychological flexibility to get a better understanding of the core processes and targets for treatment."

Furthermore, semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven participants from this sample to qualitatively explore their lived experiences of GMS. Mediation analysis was performed to test the hypothesized relations using Model 4 of the PROCESS macro tool in SPSS.

Recently, a promising intervention was implemented that is the Monocam, a ‘smart’ camera which detects drivers using their phone. The goal of the Monocam is to make individuals estimate the chance of apprehension to be higher, which should deter driver’s from MPWD. The aim of this study was to increase drivers’ perceived apprehension chance (PAC) and reduce their intention to engage in MPWD. This was done in the form of an experimental study where one group was shown a social media post from the police about the effectiveness of the Monocam. The control group did not read this post. No significant difference in the PAC and the intention to engage in MPWD was found between the experimental and control group. An explanation could be that persuasive nature of the post caused reactance. It is also possible that respondents did not trust the information in the post, because it was fictitious. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between the PAC and the intention to engage in MPWD. An explanation could be the influence of past apprehensions on drivers’ PAC and MPWD. Further research should take into account past apprehensions as an influential factor. This study contributes to the current body of knowledge on MPWD, the PAC, and the Monocam. Future research is recommended to continue to investigate intervention methods for MPWD with the larger aim to improve road safety."
Thermography as a measure of the effects of enrichment and repeated mixing on resilience in pigs,"['Zdyb, Alan']","['Rodenburg, Bas']",2022-07-26T00:01:20Z,EN,['welfare;resilience;enrichment;mixing;thermography'],Science and Business Management,"In current husbandry systems, pigs are frequently exposed to a variety of physiological and psychological challenges that may impact their ability to recover from stress i.e., resilience. Estimating an animals’ welfare is a multi-dimensional concept, which requires multiple measurements to obtain a picture of an animals’ physical and mental state. In practice, a great deal of animal welfare estimation procedures are highly invasive and in themselves, may induce undue stress. There is a strong demand for alternative and reliable non-invasive methods to gather data, to ensure that the animals do not endure unnecessary suffering.
In this study we investigated temperature responses to the combined effects of differing enrichment conditions and allostatic load, achieved through repeated mixing, on the resilience of pigs. Pigs were either exposed to barren housing (B) post weaning, or provided with enrichment (rooting material, extra toys, access to extra space, and positive human contact (E)). Half of the pigs were exposed to repeated mixing (RM) while the other half were only exposed to one mixing event at weaning (MM) in an attempt to create varying states of allostatic load. To assess their resilience, their temperature response to a physiological challenge in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sickness test, and a psychological challenge in a Frustration (isolation) test were measured using infrared thermography (IRT).
Pigs demonstrated a temperature response as a result of the challenges. E pigs had faster recovery rates during the LPS challenge, returning to baseline temperature earlier than B pigs. However, enrichment did not seem to impact the temperature response to the Frustration challenge. Repeated mixing did not have an effect on resilience in both challenges, contrary to the expectations. The accuracy and repeatability of using thermography to measure temperature was convincing for this study, insofar as its intra-observer repeatability which showed strong positive correlations and non-invasive nature.
To conclude, enrichment enhanced the recovery rate in pigs to a LPS challenge, which seems to indicate a better resilience in a sickness challenge. Repeated mixing did not seem to create a state of high allostatic load, and the combination of barren housing and repeated mixing did not seem to exacerbate the effects of lack of enrichment, as measured by temperature. The utilization IRT as a measure of resilience and the use of thermography as a non-invasive measurement tool was promising."
Beating Spotify's algorithm: towards an improved emotion label for Billboard songs,"['Kooi, Jorrit van der']","['Broek, Egon van den']",2022-07-26T00:01:18Z,EN,[],Business Informatics,"Spotify's recommendation algorithm tailors music offerings to create a personal listening experience. Though this recommender system performs admirably, there is always room for improvement. It remains unclear if Spotify accurately classifies the affective decomposition triggered by songs. This report tries to improve these emotion labels for Billboard songs. Emotion labels can be determined based on valence and arousal. The Spotify dispositions will be compared to the valence and arousal values derived from audio features, lyrics, audio features and lyrics combined, and a listener panel. These comparisons will provide insights about how emotion labels behave when audio features and lyrics are decomposed or combined. A survey was conducted to validate the results of Spotify. Participants had to rate the most ""extreme"" songs on valence and arousal inter alia. Results showed that it is necessary to analyse and combine valence and arousal values from the audio signal and lyrics. Based on the valence and arousal values of the mentioned models, significant differences were found compared to valence and arousal values provided by Spotify's algorithm. From the created models, it can be concluded that Spotify applied normalisation to increase the difference between emotion labels. This way, Spotify can provide a better recommendation based on emotion labelling.

experiences and intolerance of uncertainty","['Rutar, Minea']","['Krypotos, Angelos']",2022-07-26T00:01:22Z,EN,"['conditioned avoidance, intolerance of uncertainty, adverse childhood\nexperiences, individual differences, experimental psychopathology']",Clinical Psychology,"Avoidance of stimuli perceived as threatening is an essential element of all anxiety-
related disorders. Conditioned avoidance paradigm used to study avoidance investigates how
individuals learn to respond to aversive stimuli by trying to prevent its frequency or intensity.
While studies exist on the general mechanisms underlying avoidance, research on individual
differences in avoidance is scarce but important not only for deepening our understanding of
avoidance learning but potentially forming a basis for further studies researching the long-
standing question why some individuals develop anxiety disorders while others do not. For
example, people with more adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are more likely to develop
an anxiety-related disorder but the mechanism behind this process remains largely elusive.
Moreover, not everyone with the same amount of adverse childhood experiences develops an
anxiety-related disorder. One factor that might increase people’s tendency to avoid
threatening stimuli is their level of intolerance of uncertainty (IU). Hence, the aim of this
study was to 1) investigate the relationship between conditioned avoidance and ACE; 2) the
relationship between conditioned avoidance and IU; and 3) the moderating role of IU on the
relationship between conditioned avoidance and ACE. Based on our sample of 195
participants, cluster analysis revealed individuals did differ in how often they avoided the
aversive stimulus, but these differences could not be predicted by scores on ACE
questionnaire or Intolerance of uncertainty scale (IUS). Further research is needed to
determine whether individuals differing in adaptive conditioned avoidance differ in their
tendency to avoid non-threatening stimuli, and whether any other individual differences can
predict these individual differences."
"Childhood Trauma and Depression in Offspring of Psychiatric Patients, and the Role of Parental Support","['Roerhorst, Maxime']","['Boschloo, L.']",2022-07-26T00:01:15Z,EN,['ARIADNE; COPMI; depression; childhood trauma; parental support'],Clinical Psychology,"Introduction: Adolescent and young adult offspring of patients with a psychiatric disorder
are at ultra-high risk to develop depression themselves, and childhood trauma may act as an additional risk factor. The aim of this study was to establish the association between one or multiple types of childhood trauma and depressive symptoms in this high-risk group and to assess whether this association is weaker for offspring who experience parental support. Method: The sample consisted of 518 offspring of patients with an anxiety and/or depressive disorder who participated in the baseline assessment of the Adolescents at Risk of Anxiety and Depression: Neurobiological and Epidemiological approach (ARIADNE) study. The DSM-IV Questionnaire was used to assess depressive symptoms, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to establish childhood trauma and the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ) to determine experienced parental support. A hierarchical linear regression was performed to examine the association between childhood trauma and severity of depressive symptomatology, and a moderation analysis to assess the role of parental support in this association.
Results: Experiencing childhood trauma is associated with more depressive symptoms in adolescence and young adulthood, and this association did not differ for one or multiple types of trauma when adjusted for anxiety. Parental support did not moderate this association. Discussion: Experiencing childhood trauma is associated with more depressive symptoms in adolescent and young adult offspring of patients with a psychiatric disorder, and this association was not moderated by the level of experienced parental support. Future longitudinal research is needed to examine the course of the development of depressive symptoms after experiencing childhood trauma, and to assess the role of anxiety disorders in this association."
Interoceptive Awareness as a Mediator in the Relationship between Gender Congruence and Body Image: A Moderated Mediation Model,"[""O'Regan, Lola""]","['Bijsterbosch, Jojanneke']",2022-07-26T00:01:13Z,EN,['transgender and gender-nonconforming; non-binary; transgender congruence; interoceptive awareness; body image disturbance'],Clinical Psychology,"The present study investigated gender congruence as a predictor of negative body image through interoceptive awareness in a sample of TGNC and cisgender participants. Gender identity (TGNC or cisgender) was included as a potential moderator of these relationships. In a cross-sectional study, 103 TGNC and 94 cisgender adults completed an online survey measuring gender congruence, interoceptive awareness, and negative body image. Data were analysed using a moderated mediation analysis with gender congruence as the predictor, interoceptive awareness as the mediator, and negative body image as the outcome variable, whereby gender identity could moderate each of the relationships between variables. Results revealed that interoceptive awareness partially mediated the relationship between gender congruence and negative body image regardless of gender identity. These results suggest that gender congruence may influence interoceptive awareness which in turn may influence body image, and that these are factors which can be addressed in clinical settings to reduce gender and body-related distress in TGNC populations, thus improving overall mental health."

It is thereby about how we could formulate an account where we go from a physical description of the world to one that contains epistemic agents that can devise that physical description in the first place. This thesis will thus be focused on the question of how knowledge of the world, or science more specifically, is possible in a world that—on certain readings of our current scientific image—is ‘ultimately’ physical. For this purpose, I will draw on contemporary ideas emerging in complexity science and cognitive science, such as the 'free energy principle'. The resulting account may also partly serve as a naturalistic theory of epistemology."
"Infrared Divergences in Quantum
Gravity and String Field Theory","['Agridos, Petros']","['Vandoren, S.J.G.']",2022-07-26T00:01:07Z,EN,[],Theoretical Physics,"The main purpose of this thesis is to better understand how the Faddeev-Kulish method
works in a theory that contains two massless gauge fields. We begin with a review
of infrared divergences associated with soft particles. Subsequently, we consider as a
model the Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to a scalar field, for which the Lagrangian
and the asymptotic potential are constructed. It turns out that theories, for which the
cancellation of soft divergences with the Faddeev-Kulish method is already known, can
be partially investigated within this model. The dressing of photon states with soft
gravitons and the cancellation of the corresponding divergences, is studied as another
partial case. The dressing of scalar asymptotic states with both soft gravitons and
photons is studied as well, with some interesting features appearing at second and higher
order corrections. On the contrary, we show that if hard photon legs are also included,
the method seems to provide a series of possibly divergent operators that did not appear
in the previous cases. We close with a discussion on how infrared divergences are realized
in string theory and point some steps that might lead to the extension of the Faddeev-Kulish method within the framework of string field theory."

Especially for students with autistic traits, namely peculiarities in social style and pragmatic adaptation to the environment, this time can be marked by problems of psychological adjustment. The Systematic Transition in Education Programme for Autism Spectrum Disorder (STEP-ASD) has been conceptualized to ease the transition to secondary school for students with ASD. This study examined the effectiveness of the STEP-ASD for the Dutch version of the program (STAP), while expanding the scope to children with autistic traits. I investigated the level of psychological adjustment for all students before, shortly after, and one year after the transition as well as the (longterm) facilitatory effect of the STAP. Psychological adjustment was measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire Teacher report (SDQ-TP) in a Dutch sample (N = 54, M age = 12.14 years), using an unblinded, matched participants, controlled design. Contrary to my expectations, emotional and behavioral problem scores were highest during the last months of primary school (M = 13.58) and decreased after the transition (M = 9.26). Additionally, differences in scores after transition between the STAP (M = 9.31) and the control condition (M = 9.21) were non-significant, indicating no facilitatory effect of the STAP intervention. These findings suggest that characteristics of secondary school might even contribute to the psychological adjustment of students. Future studies should investigate the relationship of autistic traits, psychological adjustment, and school characteristics in a larger, more diverse sample."
Self-esteem Mediates the Relationship between Sexual Trauma and Depression and Anxiety in Dutch Women,"['Linden, Annelies van der']","['Tuijl, Lonneke van']",2022-07-27T00:00:41Z,EN,"['sexual trauma, sexual victimisation, self-esteem, depression, anxiety']",Clinical Psychology,"Even though some research is available on depression, anxiety and self-esteem after sexual trauma, the role of self-esteem in the association between sexual trauma, depression and anxiety has not been addressed. Understanding these interrelationships will help to provide victims of sexual trauma with adequate care. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the mediating effect of self-esteem in the relationship between sexual trauma and depression and anxiety symptoms. Data on self-esteem, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms and life events were collected from 345 Dutch undergraduate students. Based on their reported life events, they were grouped into one of the three conditions: sexual trauma (n = 122), non-sexual trauma (n = 153) and no trauma (n = 70). The results showed that self-esteem mediated the relationship between sexual trauma and depression and anxiety symptoms. Those who experienced sexual trauma reported lower self-esteem and higher depression scores than those who did not. Individuals who experienced sexual trauma reported higher anxiety scores than those who experienced no sexual trauma. Higher self-esteem was associated with lower anxiety and depression scores. Thus, integrating an intervention aimed to increase self-esteem into the treatment of survivors of sexual trauma may contribute to the prevention of depression and anxiety."

In clinical practice, the procedures and task selection of language mapping have unfortunately never been standardized. It was expected that clinicians often develop their own protocols by selecting tasks ad-hoc and based on implicit thoughts. Therefore, the aim of this research was to establish a structured, systematic, hypothesis testing approach, based on a language model, in order to achieve a structured rationalized task selection during language mapping. This retrospective explorative intra-individual study was an in-depth case analysis of three characteristic patients intended for elective neurosurgery to treat epilepsy. Data consisted of multiple-day, 24-hour-per-day video registrations. Direct electrical stimulation was used to discrete cortical areas to produce a reversible lesion, presumably simulating the effect of resection of the stimulated site. This study examined the stimulated locations, the performed tasks, the task performances and the clinician's decisions. Results showed that incomplete reports lead to an unstructured and inconsistent working method, causing electrodes and tasks to be over-stimulated and especially under-stimulated based on the 3-5 paradigm. Given the tasks performed, the clinicians focused more on auditory comprehension and spoken production than on written comprehension and production. As a result, not all the language components were examined and could not be distinguished. New tasks were advised and included in two newly constructed flowcharts which serve as a structured rationalized hypothesis-oriented task selection during language mapping."

motivation from job satisfaction and self-efficacy. Results show that teachers altogether were 
motivated for their current job yet were demotivated by the additional tasks the teaching job 
includes. The reasons for possibly taking a school leader’s job entailed taking a personal 
challenge and stating clear goals for a school. Teachers all gave a confident impression when 
asked about their self-efficacy, nonetheless, teachers expected to need more work experience
in order to perform a school leader’s function. This could Most participants were relatively 
young and future research could discuss motivational factors with older teachers. Also, a 
connection between motivation for becoming a school leader and current job satisfaction
arose from the data. This invites for further investigation."

Coumarins are plant secondary metabolites that have been found to play a role in a variety of
plant processes. These functions include improving plant defence, assisting in iron uptake in
alkaline soils, and having the ability to reduce radical oxygen species (ROS), reducing the
amount of plant oxidative stress. The functions in defence and iron uptake in particular have
been well characterised. The ROS mitigation function of coumarins has also been intensively
studied, albeit often not in plants. This creates opportunities for plant coumarin research, as
parts of that research can be extrapolated to plants. Application of coumarin research could
in the future lead to crops that are better adapted to the environment they are in, by employing
coumarin-based strategies to increase plant defence, reduce iron deficiency-based stress,
and reduce damage from ROS produced by various stress types. In this review, the three main
functions of coumarins will be extensively discussed, as well as the interplay that the
mechanisms behind these functions may have."

Quantification of topical antimicrobials in Dutch companion animal veterinary clinics: Developing and evaluating a quantification method.,"['Kardomatea, Nafsika']","['Broens, Els']",2022-07-31T23:00:33Z,EN,[],One Health,"ABSTRACT

Background: Topical antimicrobial (TAM) preparations are used extensively in human and companion animal medicine. Alterations in the bacterial flora of the treated area and emergence of resistant strains has been reported in humans, consequently to topical antimicrobial use (AMU). Resistant strains of staphylococci have also been isolated in companion animals and a reduction in the efficacy of these TAMs is of concern. Exposure to TAMs during their application by pet owners may be additionally hazardous to the owners due to toxic or adverse reactions to the drugs. Quantifying topical AMU in companion animal medicine could aid in the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance emergence and in determining the necessity of intervention strategies. Gaining more insight on topical AMU might also optimize dosing regimens, thus ensuring positive patient outcomes. 

Objective: The main objective of this study was to develop a quantification method, which could be used to quantify the use of TAMs in companion animal veterinary clinics and describe the topical AMU in 44 Dutch companion animal veterinary clinics.

Method: This study consisted of four successive stages. In the first and second stage of the study, a literature review was conducted to identify possible quantification methods and their advantages and disadvantages were explored using a sample dataset. The third stage consisted of an experts’ meeting, aiming to arrive at the final quantification method by consensus. Ultimately, the chosen quantification method was applied to a dataset containing monthly prescription data from 44 Dutch companion animal veterinary clinics and the seasonality, time trends and possible determinants of topical AMU were explored using statistical modelling.

Results: The Defined Daily Dose for Animals (DDDA) quantification method was deemed as a suitable method to quantify the use of TAMs in companion animal veterinary clinics. A seasonal effect was found, suggesting that the total use of TAMs was highest in the months July-August and lowest in the months February-March. A significant decrease over time concerning total topical AMU was also observed. The proportion of dogs in the clinic appeared to affect the topical AMU. Clinics with a larger proportion of dogs had significantly higher total, first and second choice topical AMU. Likewise, ear and skin preparations were used significantly more in these clinics. 

Conclusions: This study displayed that the DDDA method is a suitable quantification method to quantify topical AMU. The analysis of retrospectively acquired data from 44 Dutch companion animal veterinary clinics in a three-year period (2012-2015) showed the existence of a seasonal effect and a decrease in topical AMU over time. The DDDA method should be better standardized for topical AMU in the future and the intervention effect on topical AMU should be further explored."
Intrinsic effect of anionic and cationic liposomes and the effect of encapsulation of CpG C and Poly (I:C) in lipid nanoparticles on osteo-immunomodulation.,"['Flapper, Jip']","['Mastrobattista, Enrico']",2022-07-31T23:00:40Z,EN,['osteo-immunomodulation; inflammation; osteogenesis; liposomes; lipid nanoparticles; PRR ligands; Poly(I:C); CpG oligodeoxynucleotide type C'],Drug Innovation,"The initial inflammatory phase has been shown crucial for initiation of the healing cascade in bone regeneration. The modulation of the local inflammatory environment has been proposed as a promising strategy for improved bone formation after surgical intervention with bone biomaterials. The induction of mild inflammation through microbial stimuli was recently found to be involved in osteo-immunomodulation. Bacterial stimuli or pathogen associated molecular patterns act through pathogen recognition receptors. It is though that isolated pathogen recognition receptor ligands could induce a similar immune response, while being more applicable in a clinical setting. Stimulation with synthetically developed nucleic acid based pattern recognition receptor ligands Poly(I:C) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide type C were found to increase an early osteogenic marker in human mesenchymal stem cells. The receptors for these ligands are located intracellular. A suitable lipid based carrier system is used in this research for potential optimization of the biological activity of these synthetic pathogen recognition receptor ligands. With the high level of crosstalk between the immune and skeletal system it is expected that intrinsic immune modulation of the lipid carrier system can influence osteogenic capacity. The first part of this research focussed on the intrinsic osteo-immunomodulatory effects of anionic and cationic liposomes as a lipid based carrier system. Both anionic and cationic liposomes could induce a similar inflammatory response in macrophages, as well as a dose dependant NF-κB activation in RAW-Blue™ cells. However the early osteogenic
marker ALP activity, was not increased for anionic or cationic liposomes in human mesenchymal stem cells.
The second part of the research focussed on the osteo-immunomodulatory effect of Poly(I:C) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide type C encapsulated in a lipid carrier. The encapsulation of nucleic acid based drugs like Poly(I:C) and CPG oligodeoxynucleotide type C is more efficient using lipid nano particles as a lipid carrier system. Encapsulation of CPG oligodeoxynucleotide type C in the lipid nano particle showed an increase in ALP activity in human mesenchymal stem cells compared to its free form. Encapsulation of Poly (I:C) did not show a significant increase compared to its free form. All the formulations of lipid nanoparticles could induce a similar inflammatory response in human macrophages. Interestingly, the empty lipid nanoparticle could induce almost a similar response from macrophages compared to lipid nanoparticles encapsulating Poly (I:C) and CpG
oligodeoxynucleotide type C. Macrophage TNF-a production was similar for all lipid nanoparticle formulations, only IL-6 and IL-10 production were slightly increased due to transfection of the encapsulated pattern recognition ligands."

Past research has found many pregnant women do not meet the dietary requirements to support a healthy offspring having detrimental consequences on infant development later in life. Despite there being a wealth of studies investigating the relationship between diet and infant outcomes, and stress and infant outcomes, few studies have investigated these variables in one model. Although it is known that stress changes food preference, less is known about this relationship specific to pregnancy. Therefore, the current study focuses on the association between stress during pregnancy (maternal anxiety (MA) and daily hassles (DH)) and emotional (EE), external (EX) and restraint eating (RE). This study uses data from the longitudinal SMILEY cohort (Study of Microbiota and Lifestyle in the Early Years) at 32 weeks gestation. Results indicate that MA and DH are related to EE and EX, but not RE. Yet, DH did not moderate the prospective relationship between MA and EE or MA and EX. Results highlight differential experiences of stress during pregnancy and their potential relationship to unhealthy eating. Identifying pregnancy-specific stressors as predictors of dietary patterns during the transition to parenthood provides a focal point for target interventions to motivate women towards healthier food choices."

As Granada being an important province in Andalusia for food production, it is a critical region to focus on for reduction of GHG emissions by the food industry. Therefore, this research is conducted in Granada to research where individual nodes of the food chain can become more sustainable. This is research is executed by in-depth interviews with individual companies within each sector about the current sustainability strategies, as well as understanding daily business processes and problems. These interviews give insight into; first, the value processes in the food chain, second, current roadblocks and third, possible solutions that could reinforce sustainable strategies for the company. Together with the problem owner, Biomimicry Granada, we used these insights to generate concept strategies in which the Biomimicry Team could help improve the food value chain. The outcomes of the conclusion focused on education and consultancy. First solution is developing primary school lesson programs about sustainable food to reach young people that could easily be influenced to change their future consumption habits. The second solution is to begin a consultancy company that advices producers and processors about organic farming, reduction of energy and packaging impact, the latter two by means of a materiality assessment."

Additionally, an interview series into direct-to-participant investigational medicinal product supply was conducted to gain insights into stakeholders’ experiences with implementation of this remote trial activity in the European Union. 
Remote methods were found to be reported infrequently, with the exception of remote data collection, and an increase in inclusion of remote methods in 2020 protocols compared to 2019 was observed. Furthermore, this study found that, amongst others, staff training and outreach are often not reported in protocols. In terms of direct-to-participant supply, unharmonized regulations were found to be a big barrier in Europe, as, for instance, the depot-to-participant model can only happen with a pharmacist present. Moreover, interviewees emphasized a need for flexibility in trial designs, and called for more collaboration amongst stakeholders. 
	Overall, this study shows that remote methods have already been included in study protocols, and that stakeholders are positive towards additional exploration of the opportunities of including remote methods such as direct-to-participant supply in (European) trial designs."

help unaccompanied refugee minors (URM) with traumatic experiences. This study aims to 
evaluate the potential effectiveness of a short-term treatment approach consisting of multiple
trauma focused interventions. The main focus lies in the effectiveness on PTSD symptoms.
The second aim of this study was to list factors that could explain the dropout rate among 
minors, as previous literature reported URMs experiencing major difficulties with mental 
healthcare.
Method: The change in PTSD symptoms was analyzed using the pre and post-test scores of 
the CRIES-13. Since the research population was small, the Reliable Change Index (RCI) was 
used to test clinical and statistical significance for each individual. Potential dropout factors
were obtained by reading the case reports, mainly focusing on the description of the main 
theme of the session and the general notes written at the end of each session.
Results: The research population consisted of 44 participants (n=44). 15 participants had 
filled in the pre-test and posttest of the CRIES-13 and could therefore be included in the RCI 
(n=15). Nine respondents reported clinically significant improvement after the intervention 
(n=9). Two respondents reported statistical significant improvement (n=2). Four participants 
scored lower on the post-test, but the change in score was not significant (n=4). Nine 
respondents dropped out of therapy after 1-4 sessions (n=9). Lack of motivation and distrust 
towards others were the most recurring factors for dropping out of the intervention (n=6). 
Numerous URMs reported major difficulties with parts of the therapy, mainly EMDR (n=12). 
Two patients decided to stop with therapy as a result of EMDR (n=2) and four patients 
requested a different form of therapy (n=4). 
Conclusion: Veerkracht II has shown beneficial results and provides a good introduction into 
mental healthcare. All respondents attending at least two sessions reported to experience
benefits from the intervention. Although reliable pre-and post-tests were limited, the general 
results were positive. The group of URMs that dropped out was small, potentially indicating 
that the intervention met the specific needs of this group. Although the outcome seems
promising, there are reliability issues, due to a huge lack of data and inconsistent reporting by 
therapists."

These disorders have far-reaching consequences for psychosocial functioning, such as problems at work, less social contacts, difficulty maintaining relationships, and/or problems at work. Furthermore, psychotic disorders reduce the life expectancy by 20 – 25 years. Not much is known about what factors can have a beneficial outcome on functional recovery (FR) in psychotic disorder patients. One of the underlying factors of FR is executive functioning (EF) and it seems to be influenced by childhood trauma (CT) and this possibly through adulthood trauma (AT). The current study aimed to investigate whether the effects of CT on EF in patients with psychotic disorders and whether this relationship is affected by AT. The data used was collected as part of the UPS-study, a large cohort study on recovery from psychotic disorders. EF was assessed using the BRIEF-A, CT and AT were assessed using the ACE. The study included 228 participants. The total scores on the BRIEF-A and the ACE CT had a significant negative association. However, the addition of the moderator AT did not increase this association. A significant negative relationship between CT and EF was found, meaning that a higher score on CT is correlated to lower EF. There was no evidence found that this relationship was better explained by AT."

The purpose of this study is to examine the differential effects of atomistic and holistic sequenced video clips on knowledge acquisition in a flipped learning course. Using a quasi-experimental design, 98 students of two cohorts received information in how to design learning materials based on the 4C/ID model for seven weeks. One cohort received atomistic designed web lectures, the other holistic designed web lectures. An online modified card sorting task measured their knowledge acquisition. A mixed MANOVA and mixed ANOVAs showed the differential effects of the conditions over time. Results show that the holistic and atomistic hardly differ in the knowledge acquisition process in a flipped course. Teachers can use the strategy they prefer and find convenient, because students’ knowledge acquisition process does not primarily favour one over the other."

The current study was conducted to investigate the influence of physical presence of the examiner on clinically relevant outcome measures of an online version of a widely used verbal memory task in the Netherlands: the Dutch Auditory Verbal Learning Task (AVLT). Scores on immediate recall, delayed recall and delayed recognition of the AVLT were compared within participants (N=40) with the examiner physically present and with the examiner physically absent. No significant differences were found between both ways of administration on any of the outcome measures. This might suggest that currently available norms don’t have to be adjusted. Nevertheless, further studies investigating the effect of examiner presence in a larger sample and studies investigating other possible interfering factors will be necessary."
AFFORDANCE NUDGING: A NEW APPROACH TO FACILITATE HEALTHIER FOOD CHOICES,"['Brummel, Bo']","['Blom, Stephanie']",2022-08-03T00:01:01Z,EN,['Food choices; Affordances; Nudging; Choice architecture; Supermarket'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Minor changes in the choice environment, commonly referred to as nudging, can be used to encourage people to make more desirable food choices. This study investigated the effectiveness of a novel nudge that explicitly incorporates the concept of affordances, or possibilities for action, and the potential added effect of positive feedback. Furthermore, this study attempted to investigate potential spillover effects via the mediation of healthy eating attitudes, and provide insight into some potential moderators. In an online grocery shopping experiment, 347 Dutch individuals were randomly assigned to the affordance nudge, affordance nudge with positive feedback, or control condition. The healthiness of food choices was measured in two independent supermarket tasks, the first with the nudge and the second without. The results showed that the nudge had no effect on food choices and this effect was not moderated by healthy eating habits. There was also no additional effect of feedback. Consequently, no spillover effect of the nudge on the products chosen in the second supermarket task was discovered. Positive attitudes toward healthy eating as well as healthy food habits were found to predict the healthiness of the products chosen. Further research is needed to explore the influence of this affordance nudge in a more real-life supermarket setting."

instruction method to enhance students’ levels of reading comprehension. However, for peerled text discussions to be effective and to integrate them in instruction practices, teachers’
perspectives and experiences are of vital importance.
Using interview and stimulated recall techniques, this qualitative study explored what
six teachers experienced as stimulating and hindering when applying student-centred teaching
in peer-led text discussions and how this related to the teachers’ prior beliefs and teaching
habits with regards to this method. Secondly, it was assessed whether these beliefs and habits
were impacted by a six-week peer-led text discussion intervention in upper primary education.
The results indicate that the peer-led discussion program works best for teachers who
have prior student-centred beliefs and habits. Teachers with prior teacher-centred beliefs and
habits can change these habits, if they have positive experiences with the program due to
guidance in the form of SRI and self-reflection. If teachers with this type of support still don’t
believe in the benefits of peer-led text discussions, then this way of teaching might not be
suitable for them. Therefore, much research is necessary in relation to other teacher
characteristics if primary schools confront the challenge of implementing peer-led discussions
at a school-wide scale"

This research expands the scientific research of workplace FoMO, work engagement, motivation to learn and mindfulness. In total, 166 participants were included in this study. Contrary to the expectation, workplace FoMO did not negatively associate with work engagement. No negative of positive association between workplace FoMO and work engagement was found. As expected, a positive association of workplace FoMO with the motivation to learn was found. Higher levels of workplace FoMO lead to more motivation to learn. Furthermore, it was expected that mindfulness would weaken the association between workplace FoMO and mindfulness. However, a strengthening effect was found. The higher the level of mindfulness, the more workplace FoMO decreased work engagement. Because workplace FoMO is a relatively new concept, future research will need to further clarify the full range of effects of workplace FoMO and the ways in which workplace FoMO itself is affected."

Ontwikkeling van het meiden- en vrouwenvoetbal bij amateurverenigingen; ruimte geven en aanmodderen is niet genoeg.,"['Poot, Sean']","['Slobbe, Michel van']",2022-08-05T12:05:25Z,NL,['meiden- en vrouwenvoetbal ; vrouwenvoetbal ; amateurvoetbal ; ontwikkeling vrouwenvoetbal'],Sportbeleid en sportmanagement,"Er heerst een positief beeld over de toename van het meiden- en vrouwenvoetbal in Nederland (KNVB, 2021d). Echter, het is de vraag of amateurverenigingen in staat zijn om de ontwikkeling van het meiden- en vrouwenvoetbal structureel door te vertalen in de organisatie. Het doel van dit kwalitatieve onderzoek is om nieuwe inzichten te verkrijgen over institutionele veranderingen en het managen van de ontwikkeling van het meiden- en vrouwenvoetbal bij amateur voetbalverenigingen. Het onderzoek geeft antwoord op de hoofdvraag: Hoe reageren voetbalverenigingen op de ontwikkeling van het meiden- en vrouwenvoetbal en gerelateerde institutionele interventies en hoe verhoudt zich dit tot KNVB veranderprogramma’s?
Om deze vraag te kunnen beantwoorden is er eerst een literatuurstudie gedaan naar institutionele veranderingen omtrent meer meiden en vrouwen bij een sportorganisatie om te onderzoeken welke factoren van invloed zijn op een voetbalvereniging. De literatuurstudie bracht naar voren dat de voetbalvereniging als institutie kan de-institutionaliseren door institutionele interventies. De visie van Fahlén en Stenling (2019) is dat institutionele verandering bij sportorganisatie veelal ontstaan uit een probleem-oplossing benadering (mundane muddling through). Literatuur van Spaaij et al. (2019) stelt dat institutional entrepreneurs een cruciale rol spelen in de ontwikkeling van diversiteit in sportorganisaties en dat diversiteit nog niet altijd terug te zien is in de doorvertaling in de organisatie. Voor de ontwikkeling van het meiden- en vrouwenvoetbal blijkt dat de factoren van Cunningham (2007) kunnen bijdragen aan de ontwikkeling, namelijk; veranderteams, educatie, management steun en systematische integratie.
Na de literatuurstudie is bij vijf amateurverenigingen empirisch onderzoek uitgevoerd middels semigestructureerde interviews. Hieruit is gebleken dat er een aanzienlijk verschil is in het proces van de ontwikkeling van het meiden- en vrouwenvoetbal bij de verenigingen. Bij drie verenigingen heeft de ontwikkeling ervoor gezorgd dat het aantal voetballende meiden- en vrouwen is toegenomen, bij een andere vereniging is het aantal seniorenteams afgenomen en weer een andere vereniging kan op het moment geen geschikte plek bieden voor meiden- en vrouwenvoetbal. Daarnaast bleek dat het zwaartepunt tijdens het ontwikkelproces heeft gelegen bij de capaciteiten van bepaalde institutional entrepreneurs en de informele organisatie. Vanuit het congruentiemodel van Nadler en Tushman (1997) gezien bracht dit naar voren dat er in de organisatie een disbalans is in de organisatie omdat er weinig is vastgelegd in de formele organisatie en de dagelijkse (werk) taken van leden. Ook is het ontwikkelproces geanalyseerd vanuit het verandermodel van Lewin (Burnes, 2004). Het onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat meiden en vrouwen zich eerst binnen de vereniging hebben moeten profileren door middel van aandacht en zichtbaarheid om zo een toegevoegde waarde binnen de vereniging te tonen. Hierbij werd veel zelfredzaamheid van de institutional entrepreneurs en speelsters gevraagd. Na het profileren kon het meiden- en vrouwenvoetbal groeien en is er meer specifiek gekeken wat er nodig is voor het meiden- en vrouwenvoetbal. Het beleid voor meiden- en vrouwenvoetbal kon vervolgens geïntegreerd worden in inclusief beleid voor de gehele vereniging. 
Het is gebleken dat verenigingen hoofdzakelijk hebben gehandeld vanuit een alledaags probleem-oplossing benadering. Echter, volgens respondenten is het proces wel stap voor stap aan te pakken en daarom (deels) planmatig in te richten. Dit sluit aan bij de KNVB veranderprogramma’s die de verenigingen hierin planmatig kunnen ondersteunen door rekening te houden met de specifieke context van een vereniging. Dit moet ervoor zorgen dat de positieve ontwikkeling van het meiden- en vrouwenvoetbal niet ten onder gaat door vereni"
Prophets of Rage: Een comparatief onderzoek naar politieke ideeën in hiphopmuziek aan de hand van Public Enemy en de Black Panther Party,"['Hakstege, Floor']","['Gillett, R.A.']",2022-08-06T00:00:32Z,NL,[],Cultuurgeschiedenis van modern Europa,"In dit onderzoek staat de intersectie tussen protest en muziek centraal, meer specifiek de politieke dimensies van rapmuziek. Aan de hand van het album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988) van hiphopgroep Public Enemy en het Ten Points-Program van de Black Panther Party wordt een antwoord gegeven op de vraag: ‘In hoeverre kan de door Public Enemy geproduceerde muziek, meer specifiek het album It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back, als een politiek instrument worden beschouwd, en in welke mate is dat politieke instrument beïnvloed door het platform van de Black Panther Party?’
Met dit onderzoek hoop ik een bijdrage te kunnen leveren aan het groeiende corpus van het multidisciplinaire onderzoeksveld waaruit hiphop studies bestaan. In dit onderzoek worden zeven nummers van het album onderworpen aan een literaire analyse en volgt een visuele analyse van de door Public Enemy gebruikte beeldtaal. Daarnaast wordt de context waarin de muziek is ontstaan geschetst aan de hand van de autobiografie van Carlton Douglas Ridenhour, de voorman van de groep. 
Op basis van de onderzoeksresultaten betoog ik dat de muziek van Public Enemy als politiek instrument kan worden beschouwd, zij het niet in de conventionele zin van het woord. De groep baseert zich in belangrijke mate op het gedachtegoed van zwart-nationalistische bewegingen uit de jaren 70, waaronder de Black Panther Party. In de huidige tijd dient de muziek van Public Enemy nog steeds als ondersteuning voor protesten en demonstraties, dit demonstreert hoe de muziek van Public Enemy in het algemeen kan worden beschouwd als politiek instrument."
"Sex, Patriotism, and Marriage: Queering Citizenship in Jordan","['Fretz, Amira']","['Ftouni, L.']",2022-08-06T00:00:37Z,EN,['Queer of colour critique; Citizenship; Jordan;'],Gender Studies (Research),"In the 1990s, theorisations of social justice, group membership and the politics of belonging were increasingly negotiated through the lens of citizenship, owing in part to growing concerns over multiculturalism and nationalist movements in Europe (Kymlick and Norman 1994). Citizenship, as it were, ‘was the new black, and everyone was wearing it’ (Wilson 2009). However, citizenship is historically grounded in normative assumptions about gender and sexuality (Richardson 2018; Bell and Binnie 2000; Weeks 1998). Feminist, postcolonial, and critical race interventions furthermore revealed that citizen-subjects are always already sexed (Pateman 1990), gendered (Fraser and Gordon 1992), and raced (R. Ferguson 2009). The normalising powers of citizenship thus beg the question: can citizenship be queered? And, if not (Volpp 2017; Sabsay 2014), to what end do queer collectives employ citizenship discourse? This project presents a queer of colour intervention into and lends a critical legal lens to critical citizenship studies, to investigate the potentialities of queer(ing) citizenship in Jordan. Working through a performative theory of citizenship (Isin 2017), the thesis argues that queering citizenship amounts to a methodology capable of revealing the normative practices and assumptions that underlie it. It studies the legal regulation of good Jordanian citizenship, arguing that Jordanian citizen-subjects are necessarily inscribed in a reproductive, patriotic heteronormative family ideal. Finally, the project studies Amman-based conceptual webzine, MyKali, arguing that its work (as an entity and through its published content) makes claims to Jordanian citizenship, as opposed to acceptance or tolerance. It argues that My.Kali both queers Jordanian citizenship through a consistent, critical disidentification with its core tenets; and enacts queer citizenship in the digital sphere, making possible queer futures that link back and hope to transform the nation-state. Overall, the thesis thus revisits symptomatic debates on the articulation of queer strategies in/of the Arab Middle East in anglophone academia."

In this study we analyse large-scale public high-throughput sequencing data by performing differential expression analysis, pathway enrichment and integrating a gene random forest and gene set enrichment analysis to create a regulatory network. To distinguish markers of common skin inflammation from disease specific ones, we further integrate data of the skin inflammatory disease Atopic Dermatitis. We find that common differential expressed genes across all datasets are involved in immune system pathways, similar to the common genes of both diseases. In addition the disease-unique genes also show up in pro-inflammatory pathways, showing that both diseases are activated by different mechanism. Moreover, we find that Psoriasis and Atopic Dermatitis share many regulators, but we are able to distinguish unique regulators such as PRDM1, STAT3 and NR4A3 and create a gene regulatory network. Further, cellular deconvolution shows keratinization and infiltration of immune cells dominated by Monocytes and CD4+ T-cells."

Previous researchers have shown that sensory processing and family factors are among the contributing factors to SMD in children. The aim of the present study is to examine the relationships between sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), positive parenting (PP) and SMD in specifically adolescents, to uncover predisposing factors. The results are based on an online survey among adolescents with a mean age of 14.30 years (N = 318) in the Netherlands. We compared scores of SPS between adolescents with and without SMD, with further exploration of the role of PP. Against what was expected, higher SPS was not related to SMD. However, average and high levels of PP seemed to be a protective factor for SMD (p < .05). The current study highlights the influence of positive parenting on SMD. More research is needed to investigate the observed association between PP and specific elements of social media use. Furthermore, a broader investigation of how different aspects of SPS influence social media use may facilitate better treatment for SMD. This can increase the quality of life among adolescents and their caregivers."

Fortunately, prior studies found that kindness interventions can both help improve their well-being and might be beneficial for the quality of their teamwork. In a kindness intervention, people (often repeatedly) perform or reflect upon performing a few acts of kindness (e.g., helping or thanking someone) within a specified timeframe. As acts of kindness do not require much time, money or effort and many students experience high levels of stress, a kindness intervention is very suited for students to improve their well-being. Therefore, we designed and implemented a kindness intervention for students specifically and integrated it in four university courses involving teamwork. To investigate its effectiveness, we performed both a quantitative and a qualitative study. In the quantitative study, we integrated the kindness intervention in the digital learning environment of four courses, and planned to investigate both the completion rate of the kind activities by students and the effect these have on subjective well-being and teamwork in an experiment with a 2x4 between-subjects and repeated-measures design. In the qualitative study, we investigated factors influencing the participation, engagement and retention in this kindness intervention study via focus groups and interviews with students, teaching assistants, lecturers and educationalists. Because of a very low participation rate, no conclusions could be drawn from the quantitative study. However, the qualitative study resulted in both many and a diverse range of guidelines on how (not) to design, integrate and implement a kindness intervention in university coursework. Future research is needed to study the effect of performing kind activities on teamwork. Furthermore, future studies may benefit from the discovered guidelines to improve their effectiveness."

DialogueTrainer is a company that creates conversation simulations so players can practice their communication skills. Research has shown that perspective-taking is a valuable method to reduce implicit racial bias, a relationship mediated by empathy. The present study investigated whether DialogueTrainer simulations are a viable platform to reduce implicit racial bias through perspective-taking methods. In an online study, participants (N = 128) were recruited via Prolific to engage in one of two perspective-taking conditions: (1) playing a DialogueTrainer simulation of a racially charged conversation or (2) reading a transcript of the racially charged conversation. Following these perspective-taking interventions, participants (a) completed an explicit bias questionnaire, (b) completed a perspective-taking questionnaire, (c) played the prisoner’s dilemma to measure racial-economic trust, and (d) completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) to measure empathy. Data analysis revealed that racial-economic trust did not differ between the two conditions, and IRI empathy scores did not mediate this relationship. However, DialogueTrainer participants more strongly felt that the character experiencing racism was treated unfairly and had higher perspective-taking scores than those in the transcript. Although explicit bias scores did not differ between the DialogueTrainer and transcript conditions, explicit bias scores were negatively correlated with perspective-taking scores. In addition, exploratory analyses revealed that women had higher empathy scores, men more greatly tried to remain detached, and Belgian participants more strongly felt that the racist character was unbiased compared to Dutch participants. The results of this study indicate that DialogueTrainer is a promising platform to allow players to experience unfair treatment resulting from bias. Future studies and further implications are discussed."

Volatility also appears to be positively and significantly affected by geopolitical threats, even after controlling for company characteristics and year and country fixed effects. This demonstrates that a specific measure for GPRs should be included in asset pricing and risk management models, as they are an important factor when it comes both to stock returns and volatility."

Cartilage constructs are engineered with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in vitro. To generate high quality cartilage tissue in vitro, the differentiation conditions for the MSCs are crucial. Among others, bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) is a common growth factor used to differentiate MSCs chondrogenically in vitro. However, it is not completely clear how BMP-2 affects chondrogenesis and extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Therefore, the effects of BMP-2 reported in literature so far on the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and therefore ECM composition are fundamental to be summarized to have a better understanding of the topic, in order to produce in vitro cartilage constructs which can effectively sustain bone tissue regeneration in vivo.
This article aims to provide a broad overview on the effect of BMP-2 on MSCs chondrogenesis and on cartilage ECM composition. It also provides a collection of techniques helpful to detect BMP-2 remnants after cartilage ECM constructs engineering, since it could have a collateral impact on the therapeutical effects of the cartilage construct.
It is reported that upon BMP-2 binding to its receptors, activation of different molecular pathways are ensued, where cell proliferation, cell survival and chondrogenesis are upregulated. Furthermore, the expression of chondrocyte-specific genes, such as collagen type II, aggrecan and glycosaminoglycans and hypertrophy-specific genes, such as collagen type X, alkaline phosphatase and matrix metalloproteinase are stimulated, influencing ECM composition.
In detail, BMP-2 is a soluble extracellular protein that binds to BMP-2 receptor located on the surface of the target cell. Thereafter, upon the binding, two molecular pathways within the target cell are activated, namely the Smad and Non-Smad pathway. This results in a signalling cascade that ends up with the transcription of target genes responsible for the differentiation of the MSC into chondrocyte and, if the signal is sustained, ultimately in hypertrophic chondrocyte with the respective expression of cell type-specific ECM components, such as collagen type II or type X, respectively. Indeed, it has been also shown how the combination of BMP-2 with TGF-β, another protein involved in chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, induced chondrogenic differentiation in vitro and higher hypertrophic marker expression, compared to when these growth factors are not combined.
In this article, also different methods and techniques have been described to detect BMP-2 remnants left within the ECM construct after the engineering process. In detail, there are reported promising degrading enzymes of the cartilage matrix, in order to set free and expose its components, and also promising BMP-2 detection methods that exploit the immunogenicity (IHC, ELISA, WB) or the size (WB, MS) of the protein of interest, in order to be set it apart from the rest.
In conclusion, this knowledge may help to understand how to approach and effectively intervene in bone tissue engineering in vitro, in order to produce cartilage constructs to transplant, which successfully induce endochondral bone formation in vivo."

from the original Pate-GAN is that the hard privacy constraint is dropped.
Other changes, such as changing the architecture of the network, such that a number
of hidden layers depends on the dimension of input data. Moreover, the framework
will incorporate undersampling techniques to ensure that the synthetic data samples
are of the highest quality. The framework’s performance is evaluated on the basis
of machine learning utility by checking the quality of the synthetic data generated
by different methods. It is shown that the modified Pate-GAN achieves the best
results. Furthermore, the framework improves the values of statistical parity and disparate
impact, the two measures of fairness used in this study. We conclude that our
proposed modification to Pate-GAN, and the framework in general, can be used for
synthetic data generation. Moreover, it could be used as an aid for data generation
to improve fairness in the case of an imbalanced dataset."
A review of the contrast mechanisms available with (ultra)low-field MRI,"['Gironés Sangüesa, Marta']","['Bartels, Wilbert']",2022-08-13T00:00:37Z,EN,['Low and ultralow-field MRI; signal-to-noise ratio; contrast; T1 and T2 relaxation times.'],Medical Imaging,"Since its emergence, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has evolved into higher field strengths because of the higher image quality (namely, the signal-to-noise ratio) inherent of high fields. However, in the last years, low- and ultralow- MR field strengths have re-gained interest, opening up a whole world of new applications in this area, thanks to the new advances in hardware and software in MRI. Recent studies have shown that clinical practice might benefit of more affordable, portable machines accessible for developing countries, emergency rooms, intensive care units (ICU), and even surgeries. In this review, the principal applications of low and ultralow-field MRI systems will be provided by focusing on the differences in contrast mechanisms with respect to high-field MRI devices. Understanding and exploiting the characteristics of contrast mechanisms —proton density (PD), longitudinal relaxation time T1, transverse relaxation time T2, diffusion and contrast agents— permits researchers to eradicate some limitations intrinsic of low-fields and achieve the highest image quality possible in low-field MRI. The studies have shown that lowering the field strength decreases not only the SNR as previously reported, but also the relaxation times —specially the T1 values—, which resulted in the majority of the cases in a lower contrast in the images. These limitations in image quality can be, however, counteracted with the new advancements in image acquisition and processing, like artificial intelligence. The multiple advantages outweigh the limitations in low and ultralow-field MRI systems, and extend the possibilities of MRI into new fields."
Robustness to Domain Shifts in MRI for Deep Learning-based Methods: A Review,"['Pollitt, Ryan']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-08-13T00:00:34Z,EN,['Data harmonization; deep learning; domain generalization; domain shift; MRI'],Medical Imaging,"Deep learning-based approaches have seen a lot of success in the space of Magnetic Resonance Imaging from segmentation to real-time registration. However, these methods often fail to generalize to different domains, that is to say scans from different scanners, sequences or populations. We review two classes of approaches to counteract these so-called domain shifts in deep learning for MRI data: data harmonization and domain generalization, and discuss their pros and cons. Data harmonization removes domain-specific information from MR images themselves, whereas domain generalization trains a neural network to be robust to a wide variety of input images from different domains. Five papers were found for data harmonization and sixteen papers for domain generalization. Based on these papers, we conclude that both data harmonization and domain generalization are viable for small expected domain shifts. In practice, the extent of domain shifts will often be unknown prior to deployment of the neural network or will be too large. In this more realistic case, we determine that domain generalization offers better generalization capabilities than data harmonization. On the other hand, data harmonization can be used to remove domain-specific information from new data, making it possible to use already trained task networks (e.g. a segmentation network) without having to retrain on the new domain or requiring labelled data from this domain. Both methods therefore have useful applications in different scenarios."
Stimulating Vegan Food Choices With the Affordance Nudge: A One-Size Fits All Solution?,"['Fens, Maartje']","['Blom, Stephanie']",2022-08-11T00:01:01Z,EN,"['vegan, nudging, affordances, preferences, food choices']","Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","As a vegan diet has both health and environmental benefits, stimulating vegan food
choices could help with both decreasing the prevalence of obesity, and decreasing greenhouse
gas emission. We proposed the affordance nudge, in which a character is used to draw
attention to the nudged product, as a way to guide people into making more vegan choices in
their daily lives. We conducted an online study with two conditions (affordance nudge
condition and control condition) in which participants had to choose between a vegan and a
non-vegan product (n = 158). We analysed the data by doing a stepwise multiple regression
analysis. We expected people in the affordance nudge condition to choose more vegan
products than people in the control condition. We also expected the nudge to be more
effective when people do not have a clear preference for vegan food, and less effective for
people who have a low or high preference for vegan food. Results show that the affordance
nudge does significantly increase the number of vegan products chosen, but only for people
with a high preference for vegan food. For people with a low preference for vegan food, the
affordance nudge appeared to have the opposite effect, where people chose fewer vegan
products in the nudge condition compared to the control condition. These findings are
promising for the effectiveness of the affordance nudge and for including moderating factors
in nudging research, but more research needs to be done before implementing the nudge in a
real supermarket environment."
"Emotion, beliefs, and self-deception: The influence of emotional devotion in a belief on self-deception","['Eer, Toby van']","['Leer, Leslie van der']",2022-08-11T23:00:27Z,EN,"['Self-deception, emotional beliefs, bias, information processing, rationality']","Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","The availability of information is greater than ever before. However, choosing what
information to use in our decision making has become more and more complicated, due to this
quantity of available information. Emotions influence our beliefs and research shows that
biases exist to preserve these beliefs, even though, rationally, beliefs should be revised based
on new information that is presented, even if it contradicts prior convictions. Self-deception is
the process of disregarding this rational process of updating beliefs based on new rational
information to protect an emotional belief. In this research the emotional devotion of a belief
and the dismissal of rational information was measured using a novel online questionnaire
(N=80). It was hypothesized that emotional devotion in a belief (emotional belief) was
positively correlated with the dismissal of rational argumentation (self-deception). The results
showed no significant effect of emotional devotion in a belief on self-deception. Emotional
thinking explained most of the variance in self-deception. These results could imply that the
dismissal of rational arguments that are inconsistent with one’s belief is predicted by how
threatening new information is perceived to be."
"The art of emotion regulation: Association between the quality of anger regulation and the level of prosocial behavior in Dutch youth, moderated by gender (identity)","['Bruggen, Margot van']","['Liber, Juliette']",2022-08-17T00:01:05Z,EN,[],Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"The ability to regulate emotions in an adaptive way is important and partly dependent on self-regulation. It is associated with personal well-being and high quality relationships. Prosocial behavior is triggered in social situations where children, help, share and cooperate with others. In order to develop this, emotion regulation that is well developed is crucial. Disturbances in the experience of self-regulation can lead to an increased risk of psychopathology. Although emotion regulation and prosocial behavior has been linked in several studies already, it still lacks studies that examine this relationship more precisely. This cross-sectional study examined the possible coherence between anger regulation and prosocial behavior development in Dutch youth (N = 156, M = 14.29 years) and whether gender (identity) moderates this (n girls = 96, gender incongruency = 8). Data was collected through an online survey, completed by youth aged 8 to 18 years old. Anger regulation was measured by using the FEELKJ and prosocial behavior by using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Gender (identity) was examined by using three different questions regarding birth gender and psychological gender. A significant coherence was found between adaptive anger regulation and prosocial behavior, however not between maladaptive regulation and prosocial behavior. The mean age could explain this result. Moreover, girls scored significantly higher on prosocial behavior than boys, when high in total anger regulation. However, no significant moderation effect of gender identity was found. A small sample size could account for this result. A suggestion for future research would be to recruit a larger sample for gender identity and to use the perspective of teachers and parents as well."
Disjoint Paths and Directed Steiner Tree on Planar Graphs with Terminals on Few Faces,"['Verbeek, Hilde']","['Nederlof, J.']",2022-08-17T23:00:41Z,EN,['algorithms; graphs; graph theory; disjoint paths; steiner tree; directed steiner tree; face cover number; planar graphs; terminals on few faces; graph minors'],Computing Science,"In the field of parameterized complexity, the main topic of interest is to make normally hard problems more tractable. A problem is in the complexity class FPT (fixed-parameter tractable) if it permits an algorithm with a running time bounded by f(k) * poly(n), where n is the conventional input size and k is some defined parameter of the input. The consequence of a problem being in FPT, is that it can be solved in polynomial time if the parameter is fixed, despite the problem being NP-hard generally. Many different parameters can be considered for fixed-parameter tractability: usually, this is a natural parameter arising from the problem formulation, such as the weight of a Steiner tree or the size of a dominating set, in their respective problems. Other parameters may be, for example, the output size, structural properties of an input graph (eg. treewidth).

A particularly interesting parameter is the face cover number, on problems whose input consists of a planar graph G and a set of terminal vertices K. The face cover number of such an input is then the minimum number of faces needed in a planar embedding of G, such that every terminal in K is incident on at least one of those faces. While FPT graph problems already tend to perform better on planar graphs, this parameterization can create a further improvement for certain instances, where many terminals are incident on few faces.

Two problems are discussed in this thesis. Firstly, the Disjoint Paths problem is considered, which asks for a set of pairwise vertex-disjoint paths between given pairs of terminals in a graph. While it is a classically (very) hard problem, it has been shown to be fixed-parameter tractable. Different approaches to solving the problem are discussed, ending with a parameterization by the face cover number. The second considered problem is that of Directed Steiner Tree, which asks for a directed subtree of minimum weight in a graph, that connects all given terminals. The classic Dreyfus-Wagner algorithm for Steiner Tree is discussed, and it is shown that it can be modified for both the directed variant and one parameterized by the face cover number (and both). Next, a 2^O(k) * n^O(sqrt(k)) algorithm by Kisfaludi-Bak et al. is explained, parameterized by the face cover number, and adapted to directed graphs."
Methods to assess PM2.5 exposure from indoor sources in epidemiological studies: a review,"['Sandoval Diez, Nekane']","['Hoek, Gerard']",2022-08-17T23:00:39Z,EN,['indoor PM2.5; indoor-generated PM2.5; indoor air pollution; indoor fine particulate matter'],Epidemiology,"Of all air pollutants, particles with a diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5) have the greatest scientific evidence of adverse health effects, including respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous system effects, cancer, and mortality. Epidemiological studies are an invaluable and very important tool to establish the toxicity and effects of PM2.5 on human health. Most epidemiological studies have measured or modelled ambient concentrations of PM2.5 to estimate human exposure. However, humans spend most of their time indoors, where almost all exposure to air pollutants takes place.

Indoor PM2.5 concentration is a mixture of both ambient and non-ambient particles. The ambient component refers to all the particles generated outdoors that infiltrate into the indoor environment through, for example, ventilation. Nonambient particles refer to all those particles that are produced directly indoors or by human personal activities. Many human activities can be sources of indoor PM2.5, although the most important are smoking, cooking, and heating. Outdoor and indoor PM2.5 sources are different, so the particle's composition, toxicity, and human health effects may also be distinct. Therefore, it is important to treat exposure to outdoor- and indoor-generated PM2.5 as two separate exposures to investigate their effects in epidemiological studies.
To separate indoor- and outdoor-generated PM2.5 exposure, researchers have used tracer compounds whose production occurs almost exclusively outdoors and infiltrate into indoor environments, a method called source partitioning. However, the separation between indoor- and outdoor-generated PM2.5 implies many logistical challenges for epidemiological research since it often entails a great economic cost for the researchers to carry out measurements in each of the residences or indoor environments. It can also be inconvenient for the participants. This is why most of the studies that measure indoor PM2.5 concentrations do so in small study populations or for short periods of time. Having small study populations limits the ability of epidemiological studies to draw valid results.

In this literature review, we aimed to evaluate the approaches and techniques used to assess indoor-generated PM2.5 exposure in epidemiological studies of respiratory health effects, pointing out their strengths and limitations. We identified a total of 29 epidemiological studies that carried out measurements of indoor PM2.5 concentrations, of which only 5 applied methods to separate indoor- and outdoor-generated particles. All studies that applied source partitioning methods used sulphate or iron as tracer compounds, had small study populations, and studied short-term exposures. The results of studies applying source partitioning methods highlight the importance of investigating the specific relationship between indoor-generated PM2.5 and respiratory health outcomes, as well as distinguishing it from outdoor sources."
Designing an approach for highlighting requirements from elicitation interviews,"['Bondt, Xavier de']","['Dalpiaz, Fabiano']",2022-08-17T00:01:13Z,EN,"['Requirements Engineering, Elicitation Interviews, Transcriptions, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing,']",Artificial Intelligence,"Software projects start with correctly understanding what the problem is, why this is a problem and who should be involved to solve this problem. This is done by requirements elicitation, a phase of Requirements Engineering that highly relies on the communicative skills of the requirements engineer. While there are several techniques for requirements elicitation, most involve a conversation, between the requirements engineer and the client. Nowadays, most of these conversations are recorded, since online communication has spiked since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. This allows for the exploration of the transcripts of these conversations using Natural Language Processing (NLP). By using Natural Language Processing for Requirements Engineering (NLP4RE), we can extract the questions asked in the interview, after which we can classify whether these questions are relevant or not. As a final task, we can categorize these questions. By providing an overview of these relevant questions, with their category,  to a requirements engineer and allowing them to read the answer to those questions, this approach provides a direct transfer of knowledge by showing parts of the conversation. This can uncover a missed requirement or clear out any misunderstandings. In this context, we propose our approach to highlighting requirements-relevant information in requirements elicitation interviews, by using NLP in combination with Artificial Intelligence. The performance of this tool is evaluated using tagged conversations from a Requirements Engineering course, given at Utrecht University."

the emotionality and vividness of traumatic memories in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The effects of extra activation during EMDR and whether it leads to positive outcomes by taxing the working memory more is still unclear.
Objective: This study investigated the effectiveness of different levels of activation and desensitization (recall only, dual task only, recall + dual task, recall + dual task + activation). It was hypothesized that the conditions involving dual task would result in a larger decrease in emotionality and vividness compared to the conditions without the dual task. The second hypothesis was that more decrease in emotionality and vividness would be seen in conditions where participants recalled the negative memories during intervention compared to the ‘dual task only’ condition. We examined the effects of the different conditions on avoidance behavior about the negative memory in the week following the intervention.
Method: Non-clinical participants (N = 64) were randomly allocated to 4 conditions. The negative memory was induced by using a film clip. Emotionality and vividness of the memory were measured pre- and post-intervention, and at 1-week follow up. Avoidance behavior was measured post-intervention and at 1-week follow-up.
Results: There was a significant decrease in the emotionality and vividness both at post- and follow-up assessments. There was no significant difference between the conditions in reducing emotionality and vividness, nor for avoidance behavior.
Conclusions: No significant difference in the decrease in the emotionality and vividness scores was found between different conditions. The effects of different experimental conditions warrant more research. Studies with clinical samples are needed."

Exploring Physical and Mental Well-Being of Different Population Groups During the COVID-19 Pandemic as It Relates to Income Inequality,"['Youngápelian, Myka']","['May, A.M.']",2022-09-09T00:00:51Z,EN,['social inequality; income inequality; socioeconomic inequality; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; financial inequity'],Epidemiology,"SUMMARY
COVID-19 impacted populations on the international, national, regional, and community level. These impacts were felt in countless sectors of society, resulting in shockwaves that we are just beginning to understand the gravity of. One of these areas that has become clearer includes the global impact on income, income inequality, and physical and mental well-being. It has been well accepted in the international literature that members of society who were considered more disadvantaged than others experienced the COVID-19 pandemic differently. Households in lower income brackets have been more at risk to COVID-19 infection and more severe disease than of those in higher income brackets. A similar statement can be said about those with less higher education, in occupations which pay less, or other single parent households; all experienced the pandemic with a greater risk to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or death from COVID-19. This has been echoed on an international scale at the time of this writing and during the pandemic. Multiple studies were conducted to aid in understanding this picture, but few studies reported on income and income inequality on the household or individual level. The World Health Organization considers the big key factors for health equity to be social class, income, education, gender, ethnicity, employment type and employment conditions (i.e., workplace safety), housing conditions (i.e., access to clean water), behavioral factors (such as mask use), and psychosocial factors (i.e., social support). Income and income inequality are important to explore due to the impact that income has on an individual’s access to vital resources; something that ultimately has the potential to impact their physical and mental well-being. Few studies reported results in which COVID-19 cumulative incidence and mortality increased for individuals in higher income brackets during the beginning waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has been thought to be due to members of society in higher income brackets having access to freedom of movement and increased mobility through travel, increased business practices, etc. With few studies reporting on explanatory reasons pertaining to the associations of income inequality, different waves during the pandemic, and COVID-19 risk factors on the individual or household income level, much remains unexplored in terms of fully comprehending income inequality during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially as it relates to physical and mental well-being. Although not as commonly considered in the mainstream media, COVID-19 and income inequality provide an important intersection gap in the international literature, leaving room for further empirical studies."
How to join the more-than-human orchestra - Introducing eco-musicality as an analytical concept in post-anthropocentric theatre,"['Boekestein, Maartje']","['Groot Nibbelink, Liesbeth']",2022-09-09T00:01:01Z,EN,['theatre; performance; post-anthropocentrism; ecology; music; musicality; embodiment; attunement; posthumanism; Kate McIntosh; Simone Kenyon; Bert Barten'],"Contemporary Theatre, Dance and Dramaturgy","This thesis works to establish eco-musicality as an analytical lens for post-anthropocentric theatre to examine how instances of music-making and listening can facilitate experiences of more-than-human entanglement and togetherness. Informed by an understanding of ecology that centralises more-than-human interconnection and interrelation, I have based my understanding of eco-musicality on four sub-concepts: (1) attunement, based on the definition by Ash and Gallacher, which argues for a change in perception towards recognising the nonhuman as an agentic presence and interrelated collaborator, (2) embodiment, which recognises the bodily origin of sound (human/nonhuman), placing emphasis on the physicality of sound in vibration and its effect on the more-than-human body, and (3) horizontality, which draws on Bennett’s more-than-human assemblage and builds on the physicality of music-making and listening, thereby revealing musicality as a more-than-human activity. Lastly, though not an analytical sub-concept in the same right, I also consider (4) the socio-political context of the performances as it reveals the intersectionality of the ecological thought which equally penetrates my case study performances’ musical components: prompting questions of who has a voice and who is being listened to. To test out this analytical approach, I am examining three post-anthropocentric performances which incorporate musicality in varying ways: Simone Kenyon’s Into The Mountain (2019), Kate McIntosh’s To Speak Light Pours Out (2021), and Bert Barten’s Talking Trees (2018). Based on these analyses, I highlight the ecological potential of musicality in facilitating experiences of more-than-human connectedness: music-making and listening as activities which engage all matter, which disregard the arbitrary dualism of human/nonhuman, and through which theatre may enable multiple, entangled and more-than-human ways of being. I ultimately argue that it is through an eco-musical analysis of performance that we can recognise how musical elements enable ecological experiences."
Robustness evaluation of Bone Mineral Density measurements in spectral CT using Three Material Decomposition,"['Ansorena Lujambio, Eli']","['Vincken, Koen']",2022-09-09T00:00:48Z,EN,['Bone Mineral Density;BMD;Osteoporosis;Spine Segmentation;'],Medical Imaging,"Osteoporosis is a disease that can have lethal consequences, which is why its early detection is crucial. New methods for osteoporosis diagnosis based on bone mineral density (BMD) measurement have been proposed, namely Three Material Decomposition (3MD). In this new study, we evaluate the performance of the 3MD against one of the current clinical standards, Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT). We studied the regional variability of the 3MD method and determined the optimum region of the L1 vertebra for the automatic placement of a region of interest (ROI). With this goal, we developed an automatic ROI placement algorithm capable of avoiding unwanted tissues, such as, cortical bone, venous plexus and lesions. We evaluated 11 different positionings of circular ROIs, together with two spherical volumes of interest (VOI) placed around different levels of the vertebral height and proposed by Philips Healthcare. The result of this analysis indicated that the placement of a cleaned VOI provides the closest BMD values between 3MD and QCT methods, with a mean difference of 2.25%. However, we recorded large standard deviation values, meaning the precision of the tests must be improved to definitely identify an optimum region for VOI placement within the L1 vertebra. Overall, we believe accounting for the cortical tissue, venous plexus and lesions is critical in order to obtain accurate readings of the BMD value."

This choice is called the “profielkeuze” or subject cluster choice. Teachers of electives are then faced with a specific challenge regarding the motivation of students who have not chosen their subject, as this choice indicates a lack of autonomous motivation for their subject going into the rest of the school year. In this study, principles of the Self Determination Theory were used to design a lesson series catering to the needs of students following a course they will not take in subsequent years. This lesson series spanned one full chapter and included elements students, through a questionnaire and focus group, indicated that they wanted: to work together, practice exercises, to do practical assignments, and learning to study and formulate answers for the test, as well as working with PowerPoint presentations during instructions. Prior to and at the end of the intervention, the motivation of the students was measured using the SRQ-A questionnaire, adapted to the subject of physics, and from the answers students’ Relative Autonomy Indexes (RAI) were calculated. These results showed that at the end of the intervention students from the Intervention Group demonstrated a stable RAI, i. e. a stable level of autonomous motivation, while the Control Group had their RAI decrease significantly, demonstrating a shift to more controlled forms of motivation. During follow-up semi-structured focus groups, students from the Intervention Group reported feeling supported in their basic psychological needs by the learning activities presented in the lesson series, whereas students from the Control Group had to find other sources for support. These results may be used to better cater to the needs of students who feel they will not need a subject later in life."

Parental Autonomy Granting And Its Protective Effects Against Delinquent Peer Influence,"['Aernoudts, René']","['Nägel, C.R.E.']",2022-09-09T00:00:56Z,EN,['Adolescent delinquency; peer delinquency; parental autonomy granting'],Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems,"The author examined the relation between peer reports of peer delinquency and adolescent self-report of their own delinquency. Possible mechanisms of peer influence in relation to delinquent behavior were derived from differential association theory and social learning theory. In addition, it was examined to what extent the hypothesized relationship was moderated by parental autonomy granting. The sample existed of 602 adolescents (mean age = 13.4 years) from 28 school districts in Iowa and Pennsylvania, USA. The results of multi-level negative binomial regression on five waves of panel data showed that peer delinquency and adolescent delinquency were positively associated on the between-person level. The within-person results reveal no effects of changes in exposure to peer delinquency over time. Parental autonomy granting as reported by parents negatively moderated the association on the between-person level, as for adolescents whose parents report high levels of autonomy granting the association was no longer significant. Adolescent reported parental autonomy granting was found to positively moderate the association on the between-person level, meaning that the positive association between peer delinquency and self-reported delinquency was only significant for adolescents who reported high levels of autonomy granting. The findings implicate that further research to the more refined mechanisms of parental autonomy granting as a potential protective factor is needed. Policy interventions aimed at reducing adolescent delinquency and protecting adolescents from the maladaptive effects of delinquent peer associations should take into account more well-established linkages between the peer and parent contexts."
To Vote or Not to Vote?: The role of personality traits on voting behavior among the immigrant population in the Netherlands,"['Koç, Günseli']","['Drouhot, Lucas']",2022-09-09T00:00:53Z,EN,"['voting, immigrants, voter turnout, personality, Big Five personality traits']",Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems,"Political integration is a vital part of the cultural integration of immigrant populations and answering the question regarding increasing immigrant votes. Although recent literature indicates that personality traits are critical determinants for a comprehensive range of social and political behaviors, the impact of personality traits on voting behavior among the immigrant population has been neglected in sociological research. Based on the Big Five Model of personality traits, this study extends the sociological research to the voting behavior of immigrants by analyzing the effect of personality traits and comparing immigrants and native Dutch citizens in the Netherlands. Furthermore, the identification level with Dutch culture is considered as a moderator predictor of the relationship between personality traits and voting behavior among the immigrant population. The results show no significant relationship between the immigrant population's personality traits and voting behavior, while it is confirmed that the Agreeableness and Extraversion dimensions are associated with voting behavior among native Dutch citizens. The limitations of the study regarding the findings are discussed together with the recommendations for further studies. The study concluded that more comprehensive and profound sociological research of personality traits on social and political behaviors is a worthwhile avenue for future research."

Predicting demographics based on eye tracking data using machine learning,"['Heller, Jonas']","['Strauch, Christoph']",2022-09-09T00:03:15Z,EN,['Machine learning: eye tracking: Demographic prediction'],Applied Data Science,"Eye tracking has been a topic of interest for researchers for a long time and because of recent technological advancements its applications have reached multiple new areas. Even though data collection and processing has steadily improved over the years, it is still a time costly process which limits the maximum number of participants. In many eye tracking researches, there are no more than 30 participants because each person needs to come to a specialised lab in combination with an observer to set up the equipment and help with the experiment. In this thesis, data was collected with an unsupervised experiment in an installation at the NEMO science museum in Amsterdam which provided a uniquely large amount of data for analysis. It is however uncertain how the data quality is affected by the quality of the eye tracker, the unsupervised nature of the experiment and the diversity in participants. The research aimed to provide an insight into the possibilities of predicting demographics based on gaze behaviour using machine learning techniques. Regarding the lack of comparable research published on this topic, this research offers a new and unique insight. There have been differences reported in viewing behaviour between sick and healthy people, men and women as well as age dependent differences. This can result in different number of fixations, different saccade speeds or different fixation durations.
Data was collected using the Tobii 4c eye tracker in combination with a 1920 by 1080 pixel display in an enclosed installation in which participants were shown a composition for 10 seconds as a free-viewing experiment with no prior instructions. Thereafter participants were shown their most frequented areas of interest and were asked to fill in their gender (male, female, other) and their year of birth (default = 2000). The total amount of participants was 5604 with a distribution of 2423 female (43%), 2526 male (45%) and 655 Transgender/other (12%). The age of the participants ranged from 2 to 92. Participants with transgender/other gender were exlcuded as well as participants with suspected erroneus data. The final dataset consisted of 624 participants (N = 328 male, N = 296 female) in the age range of 6 to 74 years old.
Python was used in combination with the SciKitLearn package to apply supervised machine learning algorithms to predict gender and exact year of birth. For the prediction of gender, a random forest, support vector classifier and a gradient boosted random forest were implemented. For the prediction of exact year of birth, a linear and ridge regression model were implemented. The sets of input variables were tested, these always included either gender or year of birth, total number of fixations and average fixation duration. In addition to these, either exact coordinates of fixations, clustered fixations or handcrafted regions of interest were used as input. The range of numbers of fixations tried were 1 through 9 and the number of clusters used were 5,10,15 or 20. Each model was tested with each input type 100 times to ensure no outliers were recorded as consistent results.
The model's performance was estimated using accuracy and F1 score for classification and root mean square error and mean absolute error for regression. The best performing model for gender classification was a random forest with 9 fixations and 5 clusters as input which resulted in an accuracy of 0.71 and F1 score of 0.72. Age regression best performed with 9 fixations and 10 clusters which resulted in a RMSE of 8,89 years and a MAE of 7,39 years. This shows that it is possible to use eye tracking data for the prediction of demographics without extensive parameter tweaking. This research can be extended to include more high quality data, more demographics and more advanced algorithms. Possible applications for this research are in the field of medic"

Although various NER systems researched and improved for many decades, more accurate and advanced NER systems, which exploit deep learning techniques have emerged in the NLP domain, only the last few years. These newly emerged NER systems, due to the word embeddings and the non-linear transformations of data, lead to significantly improved performance. They are capable of tagging and classifying semantic entities such as person, location, organization, time, quantities, etc. more easily and accurately. For interpretation of geo-analytical questions, these NER systems should detect GIS-related semantics such as geographic phenomena, place names and temporal information. The last two pieces of information can be recognized by the current NER models, but none of them can identify and categorize geographic phenomena. To this end, this study presents two deep learning-based NER systems to extract geographic phenomena from geo-analytical questions and classify them into core concepts of spatial information that conceptually model and distinguish spatial information. The NER systems are trained by BERT and Bi-LSTM models on 278 geo-analytical questions and tested on 31 validation questions, from a corpus that contains 309 questions in total. The evaluation and comparison results showed that the BERT model had higher accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score on recognizing core concepts in geo-analytical questions, compared to Bi-LSTM."
Binary classification of EEG data to overt behavior of motor inhibition,"['Caspani, Marco']","['Kenemans, Leon']",2022-09-09T00:03:08Z,EN,['EEG; motor inhibition; stop task; machine learning;'],Artificial Intelligence,"The study of motor inhibition, that means stopping a muscle response which is almost taking place, is important for neuroscience. Knowing in advance when the brain is going to fail at this inhibition is also very helpful for applications meant to assist humans and demand attention to restore concentration. In this work, we tried to uncover the theta ground truth related to motor inhibition in EEG data (Kandiah, 2020), that is, the presence of bigger theta waves (4Hz-8Hz) in the EEG signal coming from the frontal area of the scalp before successful inhibition. Then we trained a classifier to predict whether the brain was going to fail or not at motor inhibition, starting with the EEG data of the one-second window before the motor inhibition process even takes place. The objective was to achieve a high accuracy while at the same time visualizing a clear focus on the frontal electrodes. We expected higher scores for the frontal electrodes after associating the elements of the weight vector used for classification to the corresponding electrodes. Discovery and subsequent removal of outliers uncovered the theta ground truth in the data. On the other hand, different workflows that we followed did not reach a classification accuracy higher than random guessing (50%) using leave one out cross-validation. Only training and testing on the same dataset reached an accuracy of 73%, though with no apparent theta ground truth. Modifications to the classifier from the previous work of Galama, 2021 led to the discovery of theta ground truth, even though the accuracy stayed at 50%."

A deep neural network for lake ice detection with Sentinel-1 data,"['Noordhoff, Anneloes']","['Gravey, Mathieu']",2022-09-09T00:03:06Z,EN,['Lake ice; Sentinel 1; Synthetic Aperture Radar; deep learning; fully convolutional network'],Applied Data Science,"Ice cover of lakes is an indicator of climate conditions and possible changes thereof. It is therefore identified as an essential climate variable, and tracking its worldwide timing, duration and extent is important. Due to the vast number of lakes on Earth however, it can be difficult to find efficient ways to continuously monitor the formation, duration and break-up of lake ice. Remote sensing can be a useful tool in that regard, but optical passive remote sensing can be hindered by the presence of clouds or night-time. In this study, the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is therefore proposed, an active system that can penetrate clouds and works both day and night. Because ice conditions can vary strongly through space and time, a fully convolutional network (FCN) is constructed. This deep learning network is specifically designed for semantic image segmentation: learning patterns from large amounts of data and assigning labels to each pixel in the imagery. The model is trained on four study areas from different parts of the world, and overall results show a mean accuracy of >80%. Predictions are better for non-frozen conditions ( ̴90%) compared to frozen conditions ( ̴72%). Slight overfitting of the data indicates that the use of additional study areas may be required to optimize model performance, but the overall results are promising and demonstrate the usefulness of its application in worldwide lake ice monitoring."

Multiple imputation for validating prediction models,"['Jung, Leona']","['Vink, Gerko']",2022-09-09T00:03:07Z,EN,['Keywords: observed to expected ratio; transformation; calibration; medical prediction\nmodels; multiple imputation; rubin’s rule; normal approximation; simulation; performance\nmeasure'],Applied Data Science,"Measuring the calibration is an essential part of the validation of clinical prediction models. However, missing data is a common issue which can complicate the measurement of calibration statistics like the observed to expected (O/E) ratio. By performing a simulation study, this work investigates whether transformations of the O/E ratio improve the performance of the statistic in settings of missing data handled by multiple imputation (MI). MI replaces missing values, thereby creating multiple different data sets. The O/E statistics are calculated for each imputed data set. Subsequently, the O/E statistics are pooled according to Rubin’s rules. As Rubin’s rules are based on asymptotic theory, transformations of the O/E estimates prior to pooling may improve the performance of the statistics. The simulation study considers the untransformed, natural log, and square root transformation methods to compare their performance to the true O/E, in terms of bias and coverage probability. The O/E estimates of all methods show a small positive bias and a coverage probability below the nominal. Moreover, the performance of the O/E estimates is better in the simulation condition of O/E < 1 compared to O/E > 1. With respect to the different transformation methods, the results show no significant difference in the performance. This indicates that none of the investigated transformation methods is appropriate to improve the performance."

A CONTRADICTION IN SUSTAINABILITY: THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND RAPIDLY EXPANDING FRONTIERS OF EXTRACTION,"['Baak, Liesanne']","['Namaganda, Emilinah']",2022-09-09T01:03:29Z,EN,['Graphite extraction; socio-environmental impact; energy transition; mineral extraction; Geo Information Systems (GIS); Remote Sensing (RS); Interview analysis'],International Development Studies,"Abstract 
The Global North finds itself heading full throttle into the energy transition, a transition from high to low carbon emission energy sources with the goal of fulfilling the vision of environmental, economic, and social sustainability. Alternative energy sources are being adopted to achieve carbon neutrality and to mitigate environmental deterioration. Shifting to alternative energy sources requires an increased amount of minerals, however, and this demand can only be met with increased extraction. The increased opening up of so called green mineral extraction projects calls for investigation of the sustainability of the energy transition in terms of its impact globally. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques were used in combination with an interview analysis to determine the socio-environmental impacts of increased mining in the context of the energy transition. Specifically, two graphite mines in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique, are examined. This research applied a spatial focus by conducting a Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change analysis. The LULC change findings were further substantiated using community data. The LULC change analysis revealed the heterogeneous nature of change that comes paired with the early stages of mining operations. Overall, the analysis identifies the landscape changes noticeably because of the mines’ presence, causing a reduction in vegetation. Moreover, farmland is stripped away where the mines emerge, which impacts the population’s livelihood. The affected communities inside the concession zone are displaced and must navigate compensation and resettlement arrangements. Outside the concession zone, communities expand from migration and resettlement. Furthermore, the mines cause negative health and environmental impacts because of deforestation, graphite dust and water contamination. The results are discussed as they pertain to discourses of extractivism driven by the energy transition. Extraction driven by the energy transition is not inherently sustainable, and the findings indicate how energy transition-induced mining affects localities even in the early stages. The pursuit of sustainability through the energy transition exhibits internal contradictions as it drives processes which threaten sustainability in key places of green mineral extraction."
Mapping Binaural Responses in the Brain: an fMRI Study,"['Vast, Eva']","['Harvey, Ben']",2022-09-09T01:04:13Z,EN,[],Artificial Intelligence,"The neural mechanisms involved in determining the location of sound stimuli are a controversial subject with various theories offering different explanations. One theory speculates that binaural field maps may be responsible for processing the interaural level differences (ILD) as part of these mechanisms. In this study functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on five subjects were analysed to identify potential binaural field maps, i.e., areas of the cortical surface tuned to ILD. Eight regions of interest (ROI) were identified in and outside the auditory cortex. These eight ROIs are the auditory cortex (AC), angular gyrus (AG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), postcentral gyrus (PCG), posterior and anterior regions of Broca’s area (BP and BA respectively), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Three models using either ILD or (a combination of) contralateral or ipsilateral loudness level to predict neuronal responses were fit to the gathered data and compared. The model using ILD achieved significantly higher goodness of fit inside the defined regions, indicating that these regions are themselves tuned to ILD. A significant correlation between the preferred ILD of voxels inside the ROIs and their tuning widths was found, with tuning widths increasing as the preferred ILD moves further away from 0. This matches the observation that humans are more sensitive to changes in sound stimuli coming from directly in front of them. The neuronal responses inside the ROIs show repeatable spatial variations in ILD preferences, although the structure of these variations was not identified. These results provide evidence for the existence of binaural field maps and serve as the basis for further research into the existence of population receptive field maps for interaural time difference or the head-related transfer function."
Increasing Prosocial Behaviors in Multiplayer Video Games Using Persuasive Technologies,"['Chen, Min Min']","['Ciocarlan, A.M.D.']",2022-09-09T01:03:33Z,EN,['multiplayer video game; prosocial behavior; persuasive technique'],Game and Media Technology,"Research shows that video games including social activities have benefits on psychological aspects of players’ well-being, and this is especially true for cooperative video games. We conducted a pre-study to gain insights of people’s perspectives on prosocial/antisocial behaviors in multiplayer video game context. From the pre-study, we learned that many people equate unfriendly behaviors to verbal insults and offensive messages, while friendly behaviors are allocated both to the gameplay aspect (such as helping with game tasks) and the communication aspect.
Both academia and industry have long been fighting with toxic behaviors in multiplayer video games and see many successful attempts. On the other hand, studies of encouraging prosocial behaviors in game are scarce. We study the potentials of using persuasive technologies to increase players’ willingness to cooperate in game tasks, which is shown by our pre-study as one important prosocial behavior in multiplayer video game context. We are also curious if we can enhance players’ mental well-being by encouraging cooperation in game, rather than banning toxic behaviors, which is a relatively new approach. Behavior change interventions have long been practised in health and clinical realm, thus we think it is possible to adapt them to meet our goal of promoting
prosocial behaviors in game.
To test the effectiveness of persuasive techniques in enhancing players’ cooperative behavior, we make a custom version of Public Goods Game and implement three persuasive techniques (reduction, self-monitoring, and priming). The game is split into four versions (one control version without any persuasive technique implemented, and three versions each with one persuasive technique), and we have each of 60 participants play one version of the game. Participants in treatment groups show higher cooperation level than the control group, but no significant difference is found between treatment groups, which implies similar effectiveness of different persuasive techniques.
Participants in treatment groups report lower level of ""being able to make up my own mind about things"", while the overall well-being scores are not significantly different to the control group. This suggests us to still be careful when using persuasive techniques in games as they might decrease players’ perceived freedom in play.
To conclude, this study explores the possibility of using persuasive technologies to increase prosocial behaviors in multiplayer video games, and its influence on players’ well-being. However, the scope of our study is limited and we hope it can inspire future works to further study the strengths and drawbacks of this approach."

This research looks into the mid- and long-term socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 measures and policies on mobility patterns and livelihoods of labor migrants in Kenya that travel between Nairobi City and rural areas. The research asserts the need for looking into their mobility trajectories through qualitative methods such as (life-history) interviews, mobility mapping activities and focus group discussions to lay bare how the migrants and the caregivers that took them under their wing in times of crisis, were impacted. The research contributes to the debate of analyzing migration through the mobility lens in which there is an eye for how mobility is inextricably linked to the daily lives of these migrants and emphasizes the interconnectedness of urban and rural space through analyzing both the perspective of the migrants as their caregivers. In addition, the research 
analyzes how social support packages could be tailored to better fit the needs and reach these vulnerable groups."
Assessing the usefulness of the ecohydrological model Waterwijzer Natuur 3.0 in developing an ambition map within the Province of Overijssel,"['Weele, Jannes van']","['Wassen, Martin']",2022-09-09T01:04:08Z,EN,['Ecohydrology;Waterwijzer Natuur 3.0;LESAs;WWN 3.0;Natuurnetwerk Nederland;'],Water Science and Management,"The Province of Overijssel has to comply with goals set in the national Natuurnetwerk Nederland project. In order to do so, the province needs a map (ambition map) which indicates how nature can be restored and further developed. A consortium was engaged to develop this ambition for which they decided to use the new ecohydrological model Waterwijzer Natuur 3.0. However, no documentation on the reliability of this model had been released yet and the project provided little time for the project team to assess the usefulness of the Waterwijzer Natuur 3.0. This thesis aims to fill this gap by answering the question how the Waterwijzer Natuur 3.0 can be useful in developing the ambition map. Not only was this relevant for the Province of Overijssel, but ecohydrological science could also profit from this thesis, since a new, easy to use model is being assessed. When Waterwijzer Natuur proves to be a useful model, it can be used in comparable research. The usefulness assessment has been done by performing Landscape Ecological System Analyses (LESAs) in the field and comparing field data with the Waterwijzer Natuur 3.0 results and the input it receives. Results showed that the input data for Waterwijzer Natuur 3.0 was regularly incorrect, often caused by the supply of outdated data. As a result, the quality of the Waterwijzer Natuur 3.0 results was too low to directly use them for defining ambitions for the ambition map. But it was also found that when Waterwijzer Natuur 3.0 input was reasonably correct compared to field data, the predictions from WWN 3.0 were mostly correct as well. Therefore has been concluded that results from WWN 3.0 can be used to support the formulation of ambitions for the ambition map, but only when an expert is assessing these results before formulating the ambitions."

De mogelijkheid om gedeeld gebruik te maken van een vervoersdienst vermindert de noodzaak om zelf een voertuig te bezitten. Deelmobiliteit als meer efficiënte manier van voertuiggebruik kan bijdragen aan een duurzame en leefbare omgeving en het verbeteren van de bereikbaarheid.Op dit moment is het aanbod van deelvoertuigen grotendeels markt-gedreven en richten aanbieders van deelvoertuigen zich op doelgroepen die reeds hypermobiel zijn. Dit zijn de meest kansrijke doelgroepen voor een succesvolle business-case, omdat zij de meeste verplaatsingen afleggen. Typische gebruikers van deelmobiliteit zijn dan ook voornamelijk inwoners van grote steden met een relatief hoger opleidings- en inkomensniveau, die vaak milieubewust zijn. Door het ontbreken van publieke sturing rondom deze vervoersmodaliteit ontbreekt het momenteel aan inclusivitieit bij deelmobiliteit en is een deelvoertuig momenteel een nicheproduct dat voornamelijk voorziet in de behoeftes van een specifieke gebruikersgroep. Als deze trend zich zo doorzet, dan zal deelmobiliteit in de toekomst een exclusief goed blijven en daarmee bepaalde doelgroepen uitsluiten. Reeds mobiele groepen worden dan hypermobiel, terwijl kwetsbare groepen achtergesteld blijven. Toegankelijkheid van vervoersmodaliteiten is een publiek belang en om dit te waarborgen is sturing vanuit overheden nodig.Om invulling te geven aan de wens voor een meer duurzaam, maar ook inclusief mobiliteitssysteem is een andere invulling van het mobiliteitsbeleid nodig. Momenteel richt mobiliteitsbeleid zich voornamelijk op het verkorten van de reistijd, omdat die bespaarde reistijd dan kan worden besteed aan (productieve) activiteiten. Een meer wenselijke focus, om ook aspecten als toegankelijkheid en inclusiviteit hoger te prioriteren bij mobiliteitsbeleid, is het sufficiëntarisme. Het sufficiëntarisme is gericht op een minimumniveau dat benodigd is voor mensen om te voorzien in hun basisbehoeften en het verzekeren van welvaart. In dit onderzoek wordt gekeken naar lokale beleidsmaatregelen die ingezet kunnen worden om de toegankelijkheid van deelmobiliteit te vergroten, zodat deelmobiliteit ook kan dienen voor kwetsbare doelgroepen die risico hebben om vervoersongelijkheid te ervaren. De vraagstelling die hierbij hoort, luidt als volgt: ‘In hoeverre kunnen lokale beleidsmaatregelen, zoals reeds ingezet bij het openbaar vervoer, een bijdrage leveren aan de toegankelijkheid van deelvoertuigen en daarmee het verminderen van vervoersongelijkheid?’. Om de onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden is gekozen voor zowel kwalitatief als kwantitatief onderzoek. Zo is middels de analyse van (beleid)documenten getracht een systematische vergelijking te maken tussen de toegankelijkheid van het OV en van deelmobiliteit. Er wordt immers al publieke sturing ingezet bij het OV, om deze voor iedereen toegankelijk te laten zijn. Daarnaast, om deelmobiliteit volwaardig in het mobiliteitssysteem te laten dienen; als onderdeel van de ketenreis en voor- en natransport van het OV, is het belangrijk dat het naar een gelijkwaardig toegankelijkheidsniveau wordt getild. De kwalitatieve methode, biedt de mogelijkheid om het perspectief en de ervaringen van diverse betrokken stakeholders te onderzoeken. Zo hebben interviews de benchmark verrijkt met achtergrondinformatie en praktijkervaringen. Twee focusgroepen en een expertgroep hebben daarnaast, op basis van de benchmarkanalyse, inzicht geboden in diverse beleidsmaatregelen die deze toegankelijkheid zouden kunnen vergroten. De conclusie van dit onderzoek stelt diverse beleidsmaatregelen voor die gemeenten kunnen inzetten bij het vergroten van de toegankelijkheid van deelmobiliteit. De beleidsmaatregelen zijn gekoppeld aan een gemeentelijke rol en aan de specifieke doelgroep voor elke deze dient."

As more or better green space is added to the neighbourhood, the attractiveness and public health of that neighbourhood improves, making it more desirable and increasing housing costs. In turn, these housing costs are no longer affordable for the original residents, leading to gentrification. This research focused on how municipalities take these negative spatial and social outcomes into consideration during the provision of urban greening interventions, while looking at the city of Amsterdam. Through a single-case study with two subunits this research sough therefore to understand ‘To what extent are environmental justice concerns included in the urban greening strategies of the city of Amsterdam?’. This research showed that the municipality of Amsterdam does try to involve residents and their values into the urban greening projects, however, thereby does not take potential gentrification into consideration, increasing the chances of marginalized groups being displaced."

Then we can look at the Galois representations associated to these n-torsion fields and ask when these representations are surjective. It turns out that there are multiple ways in which the image can fail to be surjective, corresponding to different kinds of entanglement. We focus mainly on so-called horizontal entanglements and different ways in which these can occur. Of particular interest will be Weil entanglement and Serre entanglement. The latter occurs because of the fact that the discriminant of an elliptic curve is always contained in a cyclotomic field, as implied by the Kronecker-Weber theorem. One of the main contributions will be on how Serre entanglement induces horizontal entanglement. Furthermore we will study Weil entanglement by looking at the conductor of corresponding quadratic and cubic number fields."

Synthesising 2D images of adult-child interaction for human pose estimation,"['Dekker, Martijn']","['Salah, Albert']",2022-09-09T02:03:52Z,EN,[],Artificial Intelligence,"In the last few years, Human pose estimators have gotten better at predicting the pose of people, especially adults. Pose estimators still struggle with occlusions and the performance on children has not improved as much either due to a lack of child-specific pose data and child bodies having different proportions. Adult-child interaction is even more difficult as it has lots of occlusions and people with vastly different body sizes. This is unfortunate as it could potentially be really helpful. Human pose estimation can be applied in many areas, e.g., in human-computer interaction, healthcare, or behavioural sciences. 
In this research, I try to improve pose estimators’ performance on adult-child interactions by synthesising data of said interaction. Authors of other studies have tried to solve the a of pose data by synthesising pose data using motion capture data. I tried a different approach, synthesising data by adjusting 3D human models’ poses in Unity. The adult and child models are adjusted such that they interact. In total I created 40 different interaction scenes, which I used to create 40,571 2D images of the interaction. During the synthesising I diversified the aesthetics to create a varied set of images. Unity automatically added precise annotations, 2D and 3D keypoint locations a.o., such that I was able to use these images to finetune four state-of-the-art human pose estimators (HigherHRNet-W32, HigherHRNet-W48, HRNet-W48 and Stacked Hourglass). 
To finetune the models, I combined a subset of the synthesised images (27,042 images) with COCO training data and trained on the combination. I evaluated their performance on a Youth images test set for which I annotated 520 challenging images of adult-child interaction. These images are challenging due to occlusions, self-occlusions, people blending in with the background and keypoints falling outside of the camera bounds. I found that the models’ AP improved by 1.81, 0.72, 1.14 and 1.55 after finetuning while the AR performance improvements are larger, 2.52, 2.17, 1.35 and 1.25 respectively. These improvement show that motion capture data is not necessary for synthesising images that can improve pose estimators' performance on adult-child interaction data."

Research indicates that bicultural individuals are at higher risk of presenting poorer psychological well-being. This study aimed to explore the relationship between cultural identity conflict and psychological well-being and the mediating role of acculturative stress and self-esteem in this relationship. Through a cross-sectional design, 184 bicultural young adults (age range, 18-40) completed an online questionnaire assessing the following factors: cultural identity conflict, acculturative stress, self-esteem, psychopathological well-being, and satisfaction with life. Correlation analyses revealed that elevated cultural identity conflict was positively associated with acculturative stress and psychopathological symptoms and negatively associated with satisfaction with life. Additionally, mediation analyses revealed a mediating role of acculturative stress and self-esteem in the association between cultural identity conflict and psychological well-being. Based on these findings, it is proposed that interventions should be designed with the aim of endorsing biculturalism and promoting healthier coping mechanisms to address the mental health issues that arise from acculturation in bicultural young adults, thusly allowing them to better navigate between cultural frameworks as well as increasing their self-esteem and psychological well-being."

These images of the face are powerful, as any system representing the face tells us something about the society that produces it. But how can we tell something about this face when it is blackboxed? Over the past few years, a growing number of artists have also critiqued and interacted with the ubiquity of these facial recognition technologies through new media art. The phenomena shed light on the current understanding of the face, face politics, and the onto-epistemological status of the face concerning this technological landscape. My research looks at the past and present representation of the face and where it collides, unveiling a message of crisis through media art from a hermeneutic and cultural perspective. The research focuses on the case study CV Dazzle anti-face (2010-ongoing) by new media artist Adam Harvey. The analysis consists of two parts combining two methods: formal analysis and critical code reading. The first part focuses on the artistic properties of the CV Dazzle anti-face and the second part on the functional properties in relation to the code it is interfacing with. The combination of these two reveals how CV Dazzle is interfacing with the technology and how this reflects a socio-technical critique showing a new onto-epistemological shift of the face and that we need a new way of looking and understanding the face in this invisible technological realm. CV Dazzle is exemplary of how the new media art can make tangible this invisible realm where faces are flowing through space and times in tiny fractions and therefore be a catalysator of this debate."
Student Representatives’ Perceived Effectiveness of their Engagement in European University Alliances’ Governance Structures,"['Ebel, Kathrin']","['Kerkemezos, Yannis']",2022-09-09T03:01:05Z,EN,[],European Governance,"One of the European Commission’s main recent policies for intensifying higher education integration is the European Universities Initiative, aiming at establishing transnational higher education alliances for cooperation in research and teaching. A central determinant for the consortia’s sustainable success is the university communities’ involvement in steering the process within its governance structures – besides academic and administrative staff, this also includes students. This thesis explores student representatives’ perceptions of their engagement’s effectiveness in alliance governance, operationalized by four dimensions, namely personal, professional, democratic and organizational benefits.
The results of a survey conducted with 67 students from 24 university alliances demonstrate generally high effectiveness ratings in all identified dimensions. Multiple linear regression analysis furthermore shows that higher perceived effectiveness is determined by staff members’ positive attitude towards student representatives, an effect which is weaker in alliances with a separate student governance body. A higher discrepancy between expectation and reality regarding the amount of power they are granted in decision-making processes is negatively associated with students’ perceived effectiveness. By discussing this contribution both in academic and practical terms, it offers guidance for future research as well as the design of student engagement models in particular and public participation processes in general."
Adaptations to Nussbaum’s List of Central Capabilities Required to Include Children,"['Nicolai, Fiore']","['Wareham, Christopher']",2022-09-09T03:01:15Z,EN,['capabilities approach; central capabilities; children; learning; epistemic injustice; autonomy; vulnerability; special goods of childhood.'],Applied Ethics,"In 2011, Martha Nussbaum published a list of ten central capabilities with the intention of it being universal for all humans. This thesis provides evidence that Nussbaum’s list of central capabilities it is only partially applicable to children. By analyzing children’s needs and deriving the responsibilities we have towards children, it is demonstrated that some of the capabilities central to children’s wellbeing and well-becoming are not included in the list, notably capabilities which meet children’s differing needs with respect to learning, epistemic injustice, autonomy, vulnerability and special goods. This means that Nussbaum’s list of central capabilities is only partially suitable to describe the central capabilities that children should have in order to be able to flourish. This finding is relevant because Nussbaum’s list is influential, not only academically, but also in policy making. Knowing that human beings aged 0 to 18 form about 30% of the world population, it must be concluded that not including the capabilities of children neglects the needs of a large group of humans: children. Therefore, this thesis attempts to make a start with a list of central capabilities for children. A more elaborated version of this new list could be used as a source of reference for those who wish to increase wellbeing and well-becoming of children, such as policy makers, and thus have social and political implications."

Sadness is caused by grief, danger and separation and expressed through intense physical displays. Anger results from insult or injury. It is shown through action and words. Finally, joy is comes from social connections or beauty and is mainly found in speech. These expressions are emphasised with emotives through the narrator. However, there are essential differences that shape how both stories convey emotion. Sadness shows that the main characters as focal points of emotional display in Guillaume d’Orange, while Perceval mainly employs supporting cast to act out emotions. Anger is more detailed in Guillaume d’Orange and becomes a source of power for its characters. Self-control is a value in both, but given more importance in Perceval. The romance also uses joy to contrast sadness, enhancing the audience’s experience of emotion. Emotional expression is comparable in its language and causation, both are tales driven by emotion. Nevertheless, the emotions serve different functions within its narrative, and so give a different experience to the respective audiences."

Driving mechanisms at local scales are poorly understood. This study aims to discover which climatical and morphological variables most contribute to explaining the Specific Mass Balance (SMB) variability of 9098 individual glaciers in High Mountain Asia (HMA). We separate the data into 15 regions assumed climatically homogeneous. We calculated correla- tions between the selected variables and the SMB. Additionally, we calculated a multivariate linear model and assessed a linear combination of the variables that best explain the SMB variability. We exclude all predictor-predictor correlations > |0.7|. We concluded that in the heterogeneous climate setting (HMA), the selected variables explain 30.7% of the glaciers’ SMB variability, with the most important predictors being the presence of a lake, the slope and the mean temperature and precipitation in 2000-2020. All predictors, except for the slope, are found to be associated with negative SMB. In the subregions, we conclude that the selected variables explain 18.1% to 50.0% of the SMB variability, with generally the most important predictors being the morphological variables: the presence of a Lake, the slope, and the median elevation. The slope and the median elevation are found to be associated with positive SMB. In all analyses, we observed a large influence of glacial lakes on the SMB. We expect this partly results from unobserved correlations between the variables lake and slope. Only the subregion West Kun Lun was associated with positive SMB. Here, we expect this contrasting behaviour to result from the dry and cold climate settings. A major limitation of this study is the use of a linear model for non-linear data. This resulted in relatively low model performance in the climatically heterogeneous region HMA."

Exploring a safe and just operating space for the Dutch energy system,"['Koomen, Daan']","['Verkade, Nick']",2022-09-09T03:02:58Z,EN,['Doughnut economy; energy system; energy transition; planetary boundaries; Multi-level perspective'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Introduction
Current policies steering the energy transition are mostly focussed on preventing GHG emissions, even though energy systems have other ecological and social impacts through air pollution, land use, health, and inequalities. By adopting the doughnut economy framework’s multiple ecological and social boundaries a safe and just operating space for the Dutch energy transition can be envisioned. The factors influencing the pathway towards an energy system within the doughnut are mapped in the multi-level perspective.

Theory
The doughnut economy framework consists of an ecological ceiling based on biophysical planetary boundaries and a social foundation consisting of social sustainable development goals, although not all doughnut boundaries are relevant in the Dutch energy system context. The multi-level perspective is used to map influencing factors and energy system dynamics within landscape and regime levels, also policies are expected to be an especially important influencing factor for sustainable transitions.

Methodology
The study uses a qualitative method consisting of literature research and expert interviews, which are used to determine relevant doughnut boundaries, and study the impacts on these boundaries by the four components of the energy system, production, transport, storage, and use. The expert interviews provide insights into expectations of an energy system complying to the relevant boundaries and the influencing factors of this energy transition pathway. The interview data was transcribed and analysed in a deductive and inductive coding process. 

Results
Relevant ecological boundaries of the doughnut are climate change, air pollution, land conversion, and biodiversity, while the social boundaries relate to equality in the current population, intergenerational equality, health, and financial resources. The main social boundary interactions were at the energy use component, while ecological interactions occurred mostly at the production, transport, and storage. Placing these findings in the multi-level perspective, landscape influences on the energy transition towards doughnut framework compliance cause frictions in the regime, while the regime also contains numerous constraints in the areas of policy, technologies, markets, incumbents, and culture.

Discussion/Conclusion
How an energy system compliant with doughnut boundaries would look, is not only influenced by the boundaries of the doughnut itself. Also, socio-technical landscape influences, such as geospatial constraints, or geopolitical instabilities lead to pressures on the regime which are currently not anticipated on sufficiently by the energy system actors and policymakers. The energy system actors can influence socio-technical regime areas like energy policy, which plays an important role determining the energy system compliant with the doughnut economy framework."

Multistakeholder Initiatives as Panacea for the Unsustainable Fashion Industry? Examining the potential contribution of these initiatives towards Just Transitions.,"['Vliex, Inge']","['Akerboom, Sanne']",2022-09-09T03:02:59Z,EN,"['Multistakeholder Initiatives, Fashion Industry, Just Transitions']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Introduction 
This study examines the potential contribution of multistakeholder initiatives (MSIs) towards Just Transitions (JTs) in the fashion industry. This industry is known for its unsustainable character, harming the environment and workers across the supply chain. This underscores the need for JTs, where not only the environment, but also workers are protected. To achieve JTs, collaboration between various actors is necessary. As such, this research assesses the contribution that collaborative platforms such as MSIs can make towards JTs. The specific focus is put on the contribution they can make towards improving the livelihoods of garment workers, since they hold a vulnerable position in the supply chain. Before going into the specific contribution these MSIs can make, this research starts with examining the impact of sustainability transitions on these workers. 
Theory 
Since MSI and JT theories have never been used in the same study before, this research drafted a novel framework  specifically combining Burke’s (2022) criterions for the future of JTs and Mena & Palazzo’s (2012) MSI input and output legitimacy framework. This final framework was specified to fit the context of garment workers operating in the fashion industry. 
Methods 
This research uses multiple research methods and multiple units of analysis. The impact of sustainability transitions on garment workers has been assessed by means of desk research and qualitative interviews with five experts. The contribution of MSIs towards JTs have been, by means of the drafted framework, examined through five expert interviews and by conducting a document analysis on four MSI cases, respectively the Fair Wear Foundation, Sustainable Apparel Coalition, Fair Labour Association and Ethical Trading Initiative. 
Results 
The results indicate that the current impact of sustainability transitions of garment workers is not clear and limited. The expert interviews on MSIs and case studies highlight that the overall contribution towards JTs is inadequate. Specifically, the inclusion of garment workers in terms of decision-making and the effectiveness of MSIs in safeguarding and protecting garment workers’ rights are limited and unclear.
Discussion and Conclusion
This thesis adds to the literature on the relative effectiveness of Multistakeholder Initiatives (MSIs) by integrating MSI and Just Transition (JT), providing a novel perspective. In addition, it provides an insight into the potential impact of sustainability transitions of garment workers, but more research is necessary in this area. Overall, this research recommends that MSIs should be reformed to make a meaningful contribution towards JTs."

Approximate nearest neighbour search identifies similar items in terms of Euclidean distance, which is applicable to create similarity graphs. The similarity graphs yield valuable metrics for the classification of fraudulent transactions. The findings in respect to the given approach are as following. First, the assortative mixing between fraudulent transactions is high in similarity graphs. Second, no topological difference exists between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. Third, fraudulent transactions are anomalies but also exist in fraud rings. Fourth, the effect of fraud rings is stronger than the effect of anomalies. Fifth, both perspectives make useful variables for a classification model which is competitive to the state-of-the-art."

Yet it is of primary importance to this research to argue that it is not the gender-ambiguous voice, but the normative structures of identity that complicates trans* existence. By analyzing musical theater, this thesis unveils how one can reconceive the gender dysphonic voice as beautiful on the premise of an aesthetic of difference. I first perform critical readings of gender dysphoria and gender dysphonia to redefine the latter as an affective state that aims to satisfy gender normativity, while simultaneously complexifying it through non-normative attempts at sonic femininity through incongruous voicing. I then shed light on the complicated dynamic of gender communication through voice in musical theater, yet also how the gender-ambiguous voice can excel under the welcoming conditions of rock-horror. Finally, I contend how the gender dysphonic trans* female voice can restructure reality-building, question the performativity of authenticity, and problematize contexts of binarized normativity through a concept-based, musicology-informed dramaturgical analysis of Rodriguez’s voice as Audrey in LSOH. By relying on voice science and studies, trans* studies, and musical theater studies to scrutinize the premise of sameness in Western aesthetics, I argue trans* female voices/performers are valuable to musical theater and trans* emancipation precisely for showcasing the sonic mutability of gender."

Although perceived social support (PSS) has been systematically and negatively linked to
stress and overall psychopathology the are no studies addressing its relationship with AMPD’S criterion B. The present cross-sectional study by recruiting a nonclinical sample of young adults (N= 65) aimed to examine the relationship between maladaptive personality traits and PSS. Consistent with our hypothesis Negative Affectivity and Disinhibition predicted lower scores of PSS. Even though our findings cannot be generalized to clinical settings, we propose that subclinical manifestations of maladaptive traits should not be underestimated. More specifically, future research expanding these conclusions should aim to to contextualize symptoms by considering psychopathology as a dynamic concept

The Link Between Bullying/Victimisation and Emotional Functioning: A Comparative Study on Dutch and Malay Adolescents,"['Garcia Garcia, Ana Sofia Garcia']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-09-09T04:02:49Z,EN,"['emotional functioning, bullying, victimization, individualism, collectivism']",Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"Bullying and victimization peak in adolescence and both have detrimental effects on individual development. Past research suggests that bullying/victimization in adolescents is associated with poor emotional functioning. To date, this has been studied mainly in Western adolescents, only representing a small percentage of the world population. The purpose of this study was twofold. First, we aimed to investigate the associations between adolescents’ emotional functioning (anger, fear, shame, guilt) and their bullying/victimization. Second, by comparing the relations in Dutch and Malaysian adolescents, we explored whether cultural orientations moderated the relations between emotional functioning and bullying/victimization. 246 Dutch and 284 Malaysian adolescents (12-14 years old) filled in questionnaires to report their bullying/victimization behaviors and their emotional functioning in the classroom. Heightened levels of fear were related to more bullying and victimization, and heightened levels of shame was related to more victimization in both Dutch and Malaysian adolescents. Anger was positively related to bullying and victimization in both groups, but the relations were stronger in Malaysian adolescents. As for guilt, it was negatively related to bullying, but this relation was found only in Dutch adolescents. Our findings showed that excessive and unregulated experience of fear, anger and shame could contribute to bullying and victimization behaviors in adolescents, regardless of the culture. Heightened levels of anger were especially detrimental for Malaysian adolescents, possibly because anger was less accepted in collectivistic cultures. On the other hand, proneness to guilt was protective against bullying behaviors although the relation was found only in Dutch adolescents, possibly because guilt was more prevalent in Individualistic culture. Our findings highlight the importance of studying adolescents’ social behaviors and emotional functioning within the specific cultural context."

together to recreate a Duplo figure while their gaze behavior was being tracked using the 
Tobii Pro Glasses 2. Four conditions were used, two in which the figure was either completely 
visible for both participants or partly hidden by other blocks, and two in which the 
participants were allowed or not allowed to verbally communicate with each other. Results 
show that very few the gaze fixations were on the partner’s face. Participants verbally 
communicated a lot more during the obstructed conditions, and most of the utterances were 
comments, reactions and questions. The times that the partner’s face was fixated on were not 
necessarily during communication, but the partner’s face was looked at more often during 
nonverbal than verbal communication. No significant effect for verbal communication on task 
performance could be found. Based on these results, robots should not necessarily look at 
their human partner often. When they do, it could be for nonverbal communication. Verbal 
communication should be informative of nature, to keep the equal collaboration roles."
Sensitivity of the Amazon Rainforest to Climate Change,"['Bellincioni, Edoardo']","['Heydt, Anna von der']",2022-09-09T04:02:57Z,EN,['rainforest; climate change; climate model;'],Climate Physics,"The stability of the Amazon rainforest against precipitation changes has been commonly studied by means of conceptual models, from which the existence of two equilibria (savanna and tree-covered) emerges. These conceptual models are based on large spatial and temporal averages of climatic variables. However, no final, comprehensive proof of bi-stability is available for the Amazon, but results are supported by a growing evidence for it. On the other hand, biome models coupled to atmospheric models better reproduce the temporal and spatial dynamics of the Amazon basin, at the cost of higher computational cost. In literature, the only available studies which make use of a coupled vegetation-atmospheric model to show multiple equilibria have a spatial resolution of ∼2° (∼220km): too coarse to properly represent the local variations of the precipitation field, especially in a system (such as the Amazon) where precipitation is one of the main drivers of change. Here we used the results of a fully-coupled, fixed-vegetation climate model run under a yearly 1% pCO2 increase with a spatial resolution of 0.25° (∼28km) and a temporal resolution of 3h to project the climatic variables (relevant for the Amazon) for end-of-century. We then fed an equilibrium biome model with the output of the climate model, ran sensitivity analyses of the biome model to different parameters, and framed the end-of-century projections among the simulated equilibrium states of the rainforest. Although substantial changes (-24% trees) in the biomes of the rainforest are projected for end-of-century, the lack of vegetation feedbacks in this setup prevented us from investigating any non-linear behaviour. Thus, we successfully implemented a simple evaporation advection scheme, which shows a coupled response of precipitation and biome variations, and suggests a stronger response between the rainforest to climate change if advection is included. This method paves the way for similar studies that could resolve non-linearities, exploiting state-of-the-art climate models and sophisticated biome models to explore spatially-resolved biome distributions with wider ranges of climate forcings."

Interestingly, 
many of the individuals engaging in anti-racist activism online are not targeted by racism 
themselves. Based on the concept of politicized identity, this research investigated if 
structurally advantaged group members taking part in social media activism in support of the 
disadvantaged group would be more likely to engage in collective action. The study used a
simulated Instagram feed through which half of the participants reposted an anti-racist 
Instagram post. It was expected that posting would indirectly lead to more collective action in
advantaged group members by strengthening their politicized anti-racist ally identity. The 
results indicate that the social media activism of advantaged group members does not affect if 
their further engagement in collective action. Posting anti-racist content leads to less offline 
activism for advantaged group members. However, this effect is supressed by the politicized
identity of a person, which promotes collective action. Further, a strong politicized identity is 
an important predictor of collective action for advantaged group members. Finally, the study 
showed that intentions of collective action strongly predict the behaviour of collective action 
in advantaged group members."

For the interviews, interrogator robots were equipped with question sets that were either innocence-presumptive or guilt-presumptive in a 2 x 2 (suspect guilt status x interrogator expectation) design. The interviews were recorded and presented to independent observers who had no knowledge of the conditions or manipulations. Observers rated suspects as being more defensive and denying harder when interviewed by a guilt-presumptive robot. The robots were seen as more pressuring and trying harder to get a confession when the suspect was truly innocent rather than guilty. However, observers did not judge suspects as being more guilty, regardless of interrogator presumption or actual suspect guilt status. Implications of the results for the future of moral human-robot interaction are discussed."

Interpersonal relationship functioning seems to play a prominent role in the development, maintenance and possible amelioration of PTSD. However, not much is known about its effect on treatment. The present study aims to investigate the predictive value of interpersonal relationship functioning at intake on PTSD treatment effectiveness. Longitudinal data of a group of 56 Dutch veterans diagnosed with PTSD were used. Regression analyses showed no predictive value of interpersonal relationship functioning on treatment effectiveness. Furthermore, the present study found both PTSD symptom reduction and improved quality of life to be valid measurements of treatment effectiveness. However, the range of theoretical and methodological considerations in the present study ask for caution in the interpretation of the current findings. Nonetheless, the theoretical framework delineated in the present study could serve as a basis for future research and a step forward in the optimization of PTSD treatment."

However, it was estimated that about 80-90% of data produced by companies are unstructured - such as PDF documents and natural language written texts - meaning that if not refined, valuable information and interesting patterns can remain hidden. The problem with unstructured data is that the information extraction process is a difficult task, due to their intrinsic uncertainty nature.
This Thesis proposes a novel programming language - ProbQL - that is a rule-based query language through which it is possible to write queries able to extract information from a PDF document or a text file. The main idea of this language is to split the given document (or text) into a list of items, and then score each item with a probability value of being the correct data to extract, based on some rules defined by the final user, describing some properties that the desired data is thought to have. The language has been tested on the task of extracting 5 types of data from PDF documents - medicine reimbursement reports - obtaining an average extraction accuracy of 86% (with a minimum of 78.3% and a maximum of 99.1%). To the best of our knowledge, ProbQL is the first language for extracting information from PDF documents and texts that is probability based, which allows to perfectly deal with the uncertainty of a desired piece of data being located in different positions based on the type of considered PDF document."

Wijk aan Zee is a small coastal village in the Netherlands where two seemingly incompatible worlds are uniting in all their complexity. The abstractness of globalization and system-thinking is embodied in the presence of powerhouses around the village, most significantly the steel factory Tata Steel Ijmuiden. On the other hand, there is the specificity of local small-scale practices in Wijk aan Zee wherein the presence of these powerhouses is contested whilst inhabitants also acknowledge that the same powerhouses constitute the fundamental basis of their past, present, and future. I uncover narratives of how the contexts of Wijk aan Zee are equated with symbolic islandness, narratives of Tata Steel Ijmuiden as both a source of ambivalence as well as a source of creative power rooted in nostalgic sentiments, and narratives of agency in standing up against the hegemony of powerhouses. In using the symbolic islandness as a productive site and by those means naturalizing flexible thinking toward the future, inhabitants of Wijk aan Zee perceive their place in the world through locating themselves not only in terms of space, but also in terms of time."

(Bennett 2010) that shapes the everyday practices and lifeworlds of local residents. In some ways, 
snow is a limiting force, as it e.g. complicates certain ways of movement, takes up space or steals 
away body heat. However, snow is also the foundation for certain Indigenous practices such as dog 
sledge riding, hunting and ice fishing in Ilulissat. These practices are not only essential for a 
sustainable life in an Arctic climate, but have a potential to serve as inspiration for more sustainable 
relations to nonhuman actors across the planet. The dynamics of the assemblage of which humansnow relations in Ilulissat are a part can therefore be understood through what Ingold (2000) 
describes as an ecology of life, which challenges any notion of a “nature-culture” dichotomy.
Snow itself is an ever present entity during the long winter months in Ilulissat. It covers
houses, doorways, roads, cars, mountains, sleeping dogs – and it shapes the landscape, reconfigures
town infrastructures, as well as it makes (im)possible certain human doings. Snow therefore
possesses a vibrant materiality (Bennett 2010), in itself, through its capacities to e.g. shape shift,
move, take up space, be a source of life and produce impressions. However, snow harvests its
agency from producing affect in the world through action (Sundberg 2021), as it relates to other
matter. The assemblage in which human-snow relations is a part, is therefore made of and
influenced by the agency of both human and nonhuman actors."

The Transformational Process of Addressing Heat Stress in Social Housing,"['Kooistra, David']","['Frantzeskaki, Niki']",2022-09-23T00:00:33Z,EN,['Heat Stress; Housing Associations; Urban Transformative Capacity; Climate Adaptation'],Spatial Planning,"As a consequence of climate change, heat waves are expected to occur more frequently, increase in duration and be more severe in the coming decades. High temperatures lead to higher incidences of heat stress among humans which can have multiple adverse health effects. Especially urban residents are at risk for heat stress which can be attributed to higher temperatures associated with the urban heat island effect. Since humans spend most of their time indoors, climate adaptation of private spaces to prevent indoor heat gain is crucial to provide people with a comfortable and healthy home temperature. As existing urban areas are not built with the ideas of climate adaptation in mind, an urban transformation is needed to bring about these changes.

When it comes to climate adaptation of private space, housing associations represent an important group of actors as they own a large proportion of private space in the Dutch urban context. Other involved actors include the tenants of the housing associations and the municipality. Due to the involvement of different actors in urban transformations – each with their own responsibilities, resources and visions on what measures should be taken – these transformations are often characterized by complexity. Furthermore, complexity arises due to variations in local urban context such as the built form. Consequently, there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution and the transformation is dependent on a good transformational process among stakeholders. 

Therefore, the urban transformative capacity framework, as formulated by Wolfram (2016), was used to analyze whether the transformative capacities are present among stakeholders in this transition. Three pre-war neighborhoods in the municipality of Rotterdam were selected as a case study for this purpose. Data has been gathered by means of interviews with the municipality of Rotterdam, housing associations and tenant associations. 

Results suggest that large scale implementation of heat resistant measures will not be possible in the near future among every housing association due to a lack of resources. This necessitates sharing of resources among involved stakeholders, an efficient and cost-effective way of choosing measures and prioritization of where to spend the limited available resources. To bridge the gap until structural measures are taken, temporary measures could present a relatively low cost solution. Furthermore, a heat plan for all housing associations that is made and distributed in collaboration with each of the stakeholders could provide tenants with knowledge of the behavioral measures they themselves can take to keep their dwelling cool. 

Additionally, more research is needed to investigate which buildings are most susceptible for heat gain, which measures are most effective for a certain building and when sufficient measures are taken. This could help to prioritize what buildings to address first in addition to other factors such as presence of risk groups for heat stress. Furthermore, a clear target for when a dwelling is sufficiently heat resistant is currently lacking and a standardized national approach could help with this

Another aspect that could improve the transformative nature of this transition is a comprehensive approach in which public and private stakeholders keep interactions between public and private space in mind. The temperature in private space is also dependent on characteristics of public space and vice versa. Therefore, collaboration between the municipalities and housing associations could lead to implementation of measures that would benefit both. An example of this are trees in public space providing shade for the dwellings of housing association. This way the limited available urban space could be fully utilized to become climate adaptive and costs would be shared among stakeholders."
Social Cost-Benefit Analysis of Mangrove Restoration in Mozambique,"['Peeters, Roos']","['Evaristo, Jaivime']",2022-09-24T00:00:38Z,EN,['Community Engagement; Mangrove Restoration; Alternative Livelihoods; Social Cost-Benefit Analysis'],Water Science and Management,"The people of Icidua, a neighbourhood of Quelimane (Mozambique), rely on logging their local
mangrove population for their livelihood to survive. Unfortunately, these same practises are causing
environmental degradation, the erosion of their natural riverbanks, resulting in floods which wash
away their homes. 50% of the community suffers from damage to their property caused by floods and
erosion. The main reason is exploitation of the mangrove forest due to the lack of alternative means
to generate income. Van Oord aims to restore the depleted mangroves in the area following the
nature-based solution approach. An integral factor in this methodology is community engagement. To
promote an increase in community participation of mangrove restoration efforts, this study assessed
potential alternative livelihoods. These were derived from existing literature and narrowed down by
the local community and relevant stakeholders. Two policy plans were compared: 1) Business as Usual
(BaU), and 2) Alternative Livelihood Development (ALD), both composed after a field visit in June 2022.
The BaU alternative was designed based on current data of mangrove-related practices obtained from
a baseline survey and community consultations. This scenario forecasted the collapse of the bridge
connecting Icidua to the rest of Quelimane, and a total disappearance of all adult mangrove trees.
These combined events would be sure to devastate the community and are guaranteed if current
erosion trends of up to 6.5 m per year continue. The ALD policy was co-created with community
members and stakeholders based on their self-selected top three preferred livelihoods: 1)
aquaculture, 2) agriculture, and 3) chicken farming. This research further assessed the long-term Net
Present Value (NPV) of the economic benefit of the current practices and implementing alternative
livelihoods using a Social Cost-Benefit Analysis (SCBA) over a 20-year timeframe. Results showed a net
positive economic impact of the ALD policy (NPV = 8,500,000 MZN (Mozambican Metical) per ha), as
opposed to a net negative outcome of the BaU policy (NPV = -1,000 MZN per ha). A sensitivity analysis
showed that BaU would lead Benefit to Cost Ratio (BCR) smaller than 1 for discount rates of 5% and
10%. On the contrary, the ALD policy resulted in BCR larger than 1 for discount rates of 5%, 10% and
15%. Therefore, this thesis shows Van Oord the necessity and positive viability of including alternative
livelihoods in their mangrove restoration project plan."

towards transgender youth can be increased through awareness or inner dialogue. We also
investigated working ingredients of inner dialogue for increasing tolerance. We conducted an online
randomised controlled trial with control, awareness, and inner dialogue conditions and a pre-posttest
design among youth aged 16 to 25 (n = 156). The T-KAB questionnaire measured the level of
tolerance before and after each condition. We compared difference scores of tolerance increase
between conditions using a one-way ANOVA. In addition, we scored the inner dialogues on presence
of reflection, personal engagement, and alliance and explored the relationship of these dialogue
characteristics to tolerance increase using non-parametric tests. Results indicated a significant
difference between groups. A post hoc analysis revealed that awareness explained an increase in
tolerance. Inner dialogue also appears to increase tolerance, but the effect is not significant.
Additional analyses of the inner dialogue condition revealed a significant difference between groups
for personal engagement, but not for alliance and reflection. Results indicate that awareness matters
for tolerance, that there is potential for inner dialogue, and that friendship is important for a positive
outcome of dialogue. Future research should focus on the design and characteristics of inner dialogue
to further examine its potential."

The goals of the study are twofold. Firstly, it will establish the association between both municipal- level income inequality and adolescent mental health problems measured in emotional and conduct problems. Secondly, using the same dependent and independent variable, it will determine the moderating effects of family SES and adolescent level of education. The findings suggest a small positive association between municipal inequality and adolescent mental health problems. However, there were found no significant effects of the moderating factors family SES and level of education."

a system that has a First Order Logic formula that has a quantifier as input and an English sentence as

Developing a Model for CD8+ T-cell Recognition of Pancreatic Cancer and its Metastases,"['Flier, Anne']","['Boes, Marianne']",2022-10-04T00:00:38Z,EN,['Pancreatic cancer; PDAC; Tyrosinase Related Protein 1; TRP1; TYRP1; Pancreatic Metastasis; CD8+ T-cell recogntion; CD4+ CD8+ T-cell depletion; Immunofluorescence;'],Infection and Immunity,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer that accounts for 90% of all pancreatic cancers. The 5-year survival rate is 11%, placing it among the most lethal of all cancers. The main contributor to this poor prognosis is the high prevalence of metastasis (seeding of cancer cells in distant organs) at the time of diagnosis. Moreover, less than half of the patients that present with only a localized tumor in the pancreas survive 5 years post diagnosis. This is linked to the ability of PDAC to metastasize early in disease progression, resulting in the presence of undetectable, small metastasis (micrometastasis). These micrometastasis grow out to macrometastasis and are an important factor for the high mortality rate in patients with localized disease. The immune system would be ideally suited to target and clear those metastasis but immunotherapies in PDAC have shown limited success. Therefore, it is essential to understand the role of immune cells during the establishment and outgrowth of pancreatic metastasis, especially T-cells, as they can specifically target and kill cancerous cells. To study metastasis our lab developed a new mouse model. In short, we inject pancreatic tumor cells subcutaneously into the back of a mouse, wait for a primary tumor to develop, then remove this tumor and after a few weeks we can find clear lung or lymph node metastasis. To investigate the role of T-cells specifically during the outgrowth of micrometastasis, we depleted T-cells, including tumor specific T-cells, after resection of the tumor. By doing so, we could test if T-cells are able to prevent outgrowth of micrometastasis. Strikingly, we found that T-cell depletion did not alter the number of metastasis, indicating an absence of T-cell control of micrometastasis. Data from other studies show that the absence of T-cell mediated immune control is due to the lack of tumor specific proteins (tumor antigens). Thus, we worked to generate a pancreatic cancer cell line that expresses the recognizable tumor antigen tyrosinase related protein 1 (TRP1). TRP1 is expressed in skin cancer tumors in both mice and humans and immunologically resembles tumor antigens, because like most tumor antigens, TRP1 does not induce a strong immune response. To use this cell line to study metastasis, we selected for metastatic cells in two subsequent rounds. We collected tumor cells from lung metastasis that have established after intravenous injection then, subcutaneously injected them in our resectable mouse model where, again, we isolated cells from a lung metastasis. Via this way we selected for cells that can both escape from the primary tumor and seed in distant organs. To eventually study T-cell associated immunity in the context of metastasis, we injected these metastatic TRP1 cells in our novel mouse model. We found that the T-cell presence in primary TRP1 tumors is much higher than in tumors without TRP1. Interestingly, when we assessed the metastatic burden of the metastatic TRP1 cells, we found few metastasis. We checked if the tumor cells in those metastasis still expressed TRP1, but could not detect any. Together, these results highlight a role for T-cells in the establishment of pancreatic cancer micrometastasis in the presence of the recognizable tumor antigen TRP1 and pave way for further studies into the involvement of the immune system during pancreatic cancer."
The role of the cooperative model as a collaboration facilitator in the Circular Economy,"['Mechielsen, Yana']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-10-04T00:00:40Z,EN,"['Circular Economy; Circular Business models; collaboration; cooperatives; collaboration strategies; collaboration facilitator; governance model for collaboration; Social Enterprises; democratic governance,']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Advancing from a linear economy to a circular economy (CE) requires organizations to collaborate across organizational boundaries. In particular for the implementation of Circular Business Models (CBMs), it is crucial for stakeholders to collaborate together along the whole value chain to implement circular strategies such as reverse logistics. Social enterprises can provide an innovative and unique approach to the CE, provided they also advance the social dimension of the CE. Particularly cooperatives incorporate promising and unique capabilities in their democratic governance structure that could foster collaboration. Accordingly, this research aims to identify strategies deployed by cooperatives to foster collaborations for implementing CBMs. It follows a multiple case study research design including ten cooperatives implementing CBMs in Europe. This research used qualitative data retrieved through 142 archival data sources, 28 interviews and three months of participant observation in the context of an academic internship at the cooperative Commown.
The results show that three types of strategies deployed by cooperatives are essential in facilitating collaborations for implementing CBMs: 1) Cooperatives can align interests by collaborating with like-minded companies, especially other cooperatives. Additionally, particular attributes of the horizontal governance structure of the cooperative proved to be instrumental in increasing alignment of stakeholder interests. 2) The social values and profit constraints of cooperatives can increase trust and foster resource complementarity with commercial corporations. Furthermore, the cooperative network can help to attract new consumers and mobilize financial resources. Moreover,  the cooperative model has the capability to create a mutual economic interest and can stimulate collaboration between different types of stakeholders with complementary tasks and or activities. 3) Lastly, the cooperative can mobilize social networks by improving (informal) relations, providing a shared cooperative culture and by (often) operating on a local scale.
In addition, two main barriers obstructing collaborations for CBM implementation relating to cooperatives are identified: 1) Resource constraints because of lack of cognitive legitimacy and higher costs of collective decision-making. 2) Misalignment of interests because of goal discrepancy or lack of engagement from collaboration partners. Lastly, two striking findings emerged suggesting further theoretical and practical implications. First, the ambivalent role of participation in the cooperative governance structure and its capability to foster collaboration challenges current literature on participation in cooperatives. Second, this thesis highlight the potential of the cooperative network for fostering collaboration for CBM implementation. These results offer novel insights for CE literature and practitioners looking to structure collaboration for CBM implementation."
Illuminating dark energy fluctuations: A study of spatial correlations in dark energy and their effect on the luminosity distance,"['Vedder, Casper']","['Chisari, Elisa']",2022-10-04T00:00:44Z,EN,['dark energy theory; supernova type Ia; inflation; quantum cosmology'],Theoretical Physics,"The origin of dark energy driving the accelerated expansion of the universe is still mysterious. We explore the possibility that dark energy fluctuates, resulting in spatial correlations. Due to these fluctuations, the Hubble rate itself becomes a fluctuating quantity. We discuss the effect this has on measurements of type Ia supernovae, which are used to constrain the luminosity distance. We show that the luminosity distance is affected by spatial correlations in several ways. First, the luminosity distance becomes dressed by the fluctuations, thereby differing from standard $\Lambda$CDM. Second, angular correlations become visible in the two-point correlation function of the luminosity distance. To investigate the latter we construct the angular power spectrum of luminosity distance fluctuations. We then perform a forecast for two supernova surveys, the ongoing Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and compare this effect with relativistic lensing effects from perturbed $\Lambda$CDM. We find that the signal can rise above the lensing effects and that LSST could test this effect for a large part of the parameter space. As an example, a specific realisation of such a scenario is that quantum fluctuations of some field in the early universe imprint spatial correlations with a predictable form in the dark energy density today. In this case, the Hubble rate fluctuates due to the intrinsic quantum nature of the dark energy density field. We study whether the signal of this specific model would be measurable, and conclude that testing this model with LSST would be challenging. However, taking into account a speed of sound $c_s<1$ of the dark energy fluid can make this model observable."
(Seeking) Asylum in the Netherlands: Experiences of and Challenges to Sustain Human Security of Afghan Forced Migrants,"['Laer, Celine van']","['Dittgen, Romain']",2022-10-04T00:01:00Z,EN,"['migration, forced migrants, refugees, asylum-seekers, irregular migrants, human security, displacement, conflict, Afghan, Afghanistan']",International Development Studies,"Through adopting a human security approach, this research aims to explore what implications forced migration movements have on experiences of, and challenges to sustain, human security of Afghan forced migrants in the Netherlands. The human security approach places individuals and communities, instead of states, at the centre of security. At the core of human security are three freedoms that are fundamental to human life: freedom from fear, freedom from want, and freedom from indignity. Fourteen semi-structured interviews with Afghan forced migrants who arrived in the Netherlands between 2007 and 2021 form the basis of this research.

This research sheds light on the predominant insecurities and conditions that drove Afghan migrants to flee. Participants fled from situations severely endangering their personal security, such as persecution and shootings. A combination of structure and agency determined when participants could flee, which routes and channels they could use, and which destinations were reachable. Financial resources appear to be an important factor in the abilities to move. 

Participants reported several insecurities in the Netherlands. They did not experience any threats to their freedom from fear. Hence, seeking asylum often involved temporal uncertainties, which gave rise to unworthiness and feelings of indignity. Some participants reported discrimination or inequality because they perceived to be treated unequally by authorities to other migrant groups. Moreover, when migrants became irregular, they often experienced livelihood tensions, threatening their freedom from want. Receiving refugee status diminished most of migrants’ insecurities. However, some felt pessimistic and experienced feelings of indignity due to the long time they spent waiting. Last, participants reported difficulties with finding jobs that match education and work history in Afghanistan, as well as instances of discrimination as possible sources of feelings of indignity.

This research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of Afghan forced migrants’ human security in the Netherlands, as well as to a more broad narrative concerning human security and displaced lives of forced migrants fleeing from places of conflict."

Eight semi-structured interviews with farmers, a pump owner, local chiefs, and a spiritual elder, as well as a survey with 45 participants, an in-depth interview with ECOLAND, field notes and day reports about common land and water practices in K’am Samnar were analyzed. The analysis has an ontological view as well as an ecological lens.
Little is known about the water and land practices of the inhabitants of K’am Samnar which is a border commune with Vietnam in the Leuk Daek district. Insight is given about the way rural livelihoods are shaped in K’am Samnar. Looking at, for example, the main source of income, food security, governance of land and water, development changes, and water, land

There is a lack of qualitative research concerning intravenous sexualized drug use among MSM and this research aims to contribute to governmental and public discourse around intravenous sexualized drug use. The main research question centers around the psychosocial reasons for MSM to engage in potentially risky behaviour such as intravenous sexualized drug use. In order to answer the research question, a qualitative, explorative study was designed, using a risk-environment framework and conceptualizing elements from well known public health models and theories such as the Health Belief Model (HBM). The main results show the individual and social dimensions underlying the reasons for MSM to engage in intravenous sexualized drug use. This research aims to put the lived and bodily experience of MSM engaging in sexualized drug use front and center, in order to potentially develop interventions and harm reduction measures rooted in knowledge gained from the community itself. Suggestions for such interventions involve ways to achieve an increased awareness of the individual and social motives of MSM associated with engaging in sexualized drug use, the development of appropriate harm reduction measures and the development of a culturally competent approach to these issues, which allows for a value neutral safe space for MSM to discuss sexualized drug use experiences."

The issue uptake of NSCLC can be determined using radiolabeled EGFR TKI PET/CT. However, recent research has shown a significant difference between image quality (i.e. tumor-to-lung contrast) in in three generation EGFR TKIs: 11C-erlotinib, 18F-afatinib and 11C-osimertinib. In this research we aim to develop a mechanistical model to predict the tumor-to-lung contrast and uptake of healthy tissue of the three tracers.

Methods: Relevant physicochemical & drug specific properties (e.g. pKa, lipophilicity, EGFR binding) for each TKI were collected and used in established base models. Key hallmarks of NSCLC: immune tumor deprivation, unaltered tumor perfusion and erratic neovascularization. Analysis was performed by excluding each key component and comparing the PE with the final mechanistical PBPK-model predictions. Model accuracy was demonstrated by calculating the prediction error (PE) between predicted tissue to blood ratios (TBR) and measured, PET image derived, TBR.

Results: The fitted models were able to predict the tumor-to-lung contrast for all EGFR-TKIs within 3-fold of observed PET image ratios (PE Tumor-to-lung ratio of -93%, +43% and-7.4 % for erlotinib, osimertinib and afatinib respectively). Furthermore, the models depicted agreeable whole-body distribution for osimertinib and afatinib, showing high tissue distribution and an underprediction and low tissue distribution at high blood concentrations for erlotinib (mean PE, of -4.4%, range -156% - +187%, for all tissues).

Conclusion: The developed models adequately predicted the image quality of afatinib, osimertinib and erlotinib. Some deviations in predicted whole-body TBR lead to new hypotheses such increased affinity for mutated EGFR and active influx transport (erlotinib into excreting tissues) or active efflux (afatinib from brain), which is currently unaccounted for. In the future, the models may be used to predict the image quality of new tracers."

Investigation of the issue has a storied past, but the methods used have all shared serious limitations. The goal of this study was to document and analyze correlations between surface air temperature and the average incomes of residents or the population density of areas affected. The study hypothesized that a positive correlation would be found between surface air temperature and population density, while a negative correlation would be found between surface air temperature and average income. The study’s literature review gives readers an easily comprehensible primer for this topic, covering both the nature of UHI and its methods of investigation. The issue of environmental justice and vulnerability to heat amongst certain populations is also explored as these ideas heavily informed the study’s purpose and hypothesis. This study used crowdsourced point measurements of the surface air temperature taken via NETATMO weather-recording devices in private homes. This data was used to investigate UHI and surface temperatures in general in the state of Illinois, the city of Chicago, the continental Netherlands, and the city of Amsterdam. This data was collected at four different times over the course of August 20, 2021. The point data was then used to create continuous field temperature maps of each study area, extrapolating temperature values between the points for which data was recorded. Average temperatures were then found for each administrative unit (county, municipality, or neighborhood) at each of the four times in each study area, resulting in four air surface temperature maps for each study area that track values throughout the day. Average income per household and population density data were collected for administrative units in all study areas and then compared with the surface air temperature maps to find trends, patterns, and possible correlations. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) and bivariate analysis (BA) were used to analyze the resulting map data in order to better understand how temperature values varied with distance between data points and across all four study areas. The results are strongest and most clear for the Netherlands, where data points are the most robust and widespread. Overall, the GWR results indicate a consistent and moderately strong correlation between surface air temperature and both average income values and population density. The BA results suggest that the correlation is negative for average income values and positive for population density. The majority of the results at each step of the investigative process are shown using maps created in ArcGIS Pro."
"The role of Perceived Control, Social Support, and Socioeconomic Position on the relationship between Stress and Attitudes towards a VUCA-world in times of COVID-19.","['Berg, Sybrit van den']","['Bal, Michèlle']",2022-10-14T10:00:35Z,EN,"['VUCA-world, attitudes towards a VUCA-world, stress, perceived control social support, socioeconomic position, challenge, threat.']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Background: The world becomes increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) (Johansen, 2007). The COVID-19 pandemic likely exacerbates the experience of a VUCA-world, because the pandemic led to increased levels of uncertainty. Simultaneously, a VUCA-world can be perceived differently by people, more as a threat, but also as a challenge. This study investigated potential important factors (i.e., perceived control, social support and socioeconomic position) that influence dealing with stress, i.e., the threat vs. challenge experience, in the context of attitudes towards a VUCA-world.
Methods: A total of 54,703 persons were randomly selected from the region of Utrecht and invited to fill in either a web-based or a paper questionnaire of the Public Health Monitor executed by the GGD and the municipality of Utrecht in collaboration with RIVM and CBS. 44,996 participants from 18 to 103 years old (M = 55.30, SD = 19.38), fully completed the used variables of the questionnaire. Multiple regression analyses, including moderation and mediation, were used. 
Results: Findings showed that people with more stress have more negative attitudes towards a VUCA-world, partly explained by perceived control. Experiencing more social support appears to be associated with less stress and more perceived control, which indirectly influences the attitude towards a VUCA-world. People with a lower socioeconomic position (SEP) experience more negative attitudes towards a VUCA-world, and less perceived control. 
Conclusions: By, among the first, researching VUCA from a social science perspective, it can be concluded that people differ in attitudes towards a VUCA-world. Results showed that stress, perceived control, and SEP shape whether the VUCA-world is perceived as a threat or a challenge. This research has lain the groundwork for a subsequent study in social science about a VUCA-world."

In doing so, this thesis echoes the demand for critical migration and border studies that consider colonial continuities and thus create a nuanced understanding of migration control, omitting neither temporal and spatial particularities nor continuities, and heightening the perception of the relations of domination to which the control of mobilities is always tied to. In order to approach these complex relations, the question is raised: “How are deportations, deportabilities and racial formations entangled in and through the European control of migrant mobilities and the externalization of this control?” Thus, the complex entanglement of deportations and racial formations is approached not alone in the actual moment of deportation, but also in the prospect of deportations: the condition of being liable to deportation. Based on decolonial conceptualizations of racial formations, I address this question in three different spatiotemporal sites: using different sources and the colonial imaginaries revealed or contained therein, I examine the entanglement of deportations, deportabilities and racial formations in Switzerland, in the Central Mediterranean and in Algeria. This enables to demonstrate the particularities but also structural similarities of this entanglement in different spatiotemporal sites. Further, this question is examined considering the interconnections between different deportations practices and racial formations through the increasing outsourcing of European migration control and deportations. Thus, this thesis contributes to a rethinking of deportations and deportabilities and their outsourcing as a racialized and racializing mechanism that is deeply embedded in relations of domination – and therewith, it is intended to contribute to the repoliticization of the often unnoticed and normalized bordering practice of deportation."

The aims of this study were threefold, by examining whether; 1) people who identify themselves as Chinese experience more COVID-19-associated discrimination and have poorer mental health compared with Dutch or people of another ethnic group; 2) COVID-19-associated discrimination mediates the relation between ethnic groups (Chinese, Dutch and other ethnic groups) and mental health; 3) ‘importance to ethnic identity’ is a moderator in the relation between COVID-19-associated discrimination and mental health.
Methods: Participants consisted of a convenience sample of residents aged ≥ 18 across the Netherlands (n = 290), by filling in a questionnaire. Regression analyses were conducted to analyze differences in COVID-19-associated discrimination and mental health between ethnic groups. Mediation analyses, using PROCESS, were performed to analyze COVID-19-associated discrimination in the relation between ethnic groups and mental health. Moderator analyses, using PROCESS, were conducted to analyze ‘importance to ethnic identity’ in the relation between COVID-19-associated discrimination and mental health.
Results: Participants who identified themselves as Chinese or another ethnic group experienced more COVID-19-associated discrimination compared with Dutch. Also, participants who identified themselves as Chinese or another ethnic group had poorer mental health compared with Dutch, partly mediated by COVID-19-associated discrimination. ‘Importance to ethnic identity’ did not significantly moderate the relation between COVID-19-associated discrimination and mental health. 
Conclusion: Chinese and ethnic groups experience more COVID-19-associated discrimination and have poorer mental health compared with Dutch. Campaigns should raise awareness about COVID-19-associated discrimination against ethnic groups in the Netherlands and attention should be paid on the organizations Asian Raisins and Discriminatie.nl, where discrimination can be reported and that combats discrimination in society."
Relevance Realization as a Solution to the Frame Problem: A Comparison of Four Cognitive Architectures,"['Kaaij, Maxim van der']","['Caret, Colin']",2022-10-18T00:00:32Z,EN,['artificial general intelligence; frame problem; relevance realization; cognitive architecture'],Artificial Intelligence,"One of the largest remaining challenges in the field of artificial intelligence is the creation of a so-called artificial general intelligence (AGI): a system that is competent across a large number of domains of action and that is able to efficiently learn new skills in novel domains. Here, I argue that the main reason we currently have not been able to build an AGI is because of the unsolved frame problem from the philosophy of artificial intelligence. I present the framework of relevance realization, an attempt to a solution to the frame problem (Vervaeke, 2012), discuss some of the features of the framework and suggest two additional ones. I argue that a complete theory of relevance realization would indeed form a solution to the frame problem and thereby also to the problem of general intelligence. I compare four existing cognitive architectures for artificial general intelligence (CLARION, LIDA, AKIRA and IKON FLUX), and evaluate each architecture on the basis of the features of the framework of relevance realization as suggested by Vervaeke and myself. I conclude that AKIRA and IKON FLUX score highest on this comparison and end with a suggestion of a rough sketch for a new cognitive architecture that incorporates the best of each of the four earlier discussed architectures. I then argue that such a design, since it best incorporates the framework of relevance realization, thereby best approximating a solution to the frame problem, will be most promising as a design of a cognitive architecture for artificial general intelligence."

Because of traditional gender norms, it is expected for the female to focus on household tasks, meaning that most ‘victims’ of HWD are female. However, the exact relationship between HWD and wellbeing is rather understudied. Various literary works suggest this relationship could be explained via relationship satisfaction. This study examined this relationship by performing a cross-sectional analysis on existing data from the LISS panel. This data consisted of 995 participants, with a relative equal division between female (531) and male (464). Subsequently a mediation analysis was performed for relationship satisfaction and the control variable age, education, and traditional gender norms. After the analysis there was no significant effect found for relationship satisfaction as mediator. This could be because of the origin of the data, the time of the data or even because another variable might be influencing the effect. There were however significant associations found for HWD, relationship satisfaction, age, and education on wellbeing, for women. Compared to men, these results are almost the same, with HWD only being significant for women, while traditional gender norms are significant for men. The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that the relationship between HWD and wellbeing needs to be studied further, longer over time, and with primary qualitative data so that the operationalization of the variables can be done beforehand. This future research should take gender differences into account, especially HWD and traditional gender norms, as these are the main differentiators between women and men."
The Effects of Risk Factors of Transport Poverty on the Usage of Shared Bicycles and Mopeds: An Explorative Case Study in the City of Rotterdam,"['Wouw, Chayenne van de']","['Wit, John de']",2022-10-24T14:00:37Z,EN,"['Transport poverty, shared bicycles, mopeds, socio-economic risk background']",Social Policy and Public Health,"In the context of answering sustainability and health challenges as well as addressing
increasing pressures on urban infrastructure, shared bicycles and mopeds promise to have 
many advantages. Simultaneously, there is increasing attention for the concept of transport 
poverty. It is often presumed that experiencing transport poverty leads to a reduced 
(perceived) ability to reach key activity locations required for participation in society and a 
good quality of life. Little remains known about shared bicycles and mopeds in relation to 
transport poverty, especially in a societal context where cycling is already commonly 
practised. Therefore, this thesis researched how various risk factors of transport poverty relate 
to the usage of shared bicycles and mopeds in the municipality of Rotterdam. Based on 
existing data collected through a survey conducted in Rotterdam, two binary logistic 
regression models were developed to identify what and how risk factors of transport poverty 
are related to the usage of shared bicycles and mopeds. The research concluded that risk 
factors such as socio-economic risk background (age, gender, and education) and
competencies (having a driver’s license) predicted a significant reduced likeness for having 
used a shared bicycle or moped. While perceived and objective access to transport options 
(e.g. perceived traffic flow by car) were not found to be statistically significant for predicting 
shared bicycle usage, this risk factor was significant for predicting usage of shared mopeds. 
Neighbourhood of residence was not significant for predicting usage of both shared bicycles 
and mopeds. Despite these mixed findings, the results of this thesis suggest that shared 
bicycles and mopeds do not inherently reduce inequity in opportunities to participate in 
society caused by transport poverty. This highlights the need for public authorities to make 
further efforts to prevent aggravating inequalities for those at risk of transport poverty."
Beyond income inequality: the mediating effect of trust and  fairness on the relationship between multiple indicators of  inequality and subjective well-being,"['Wesdorp, Noortje']","['Wit, John de']",2022-10-24T14:00:35Z,EN,"['subjective well-being, non-economic inequality, trust, fairness, social gradient']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Inequality in Europe has increased in the past decades. Recent studies have shown that 
increasing income inequality has a negative effect on subjective well-being (SWB) and other 
health outcomes. Yet, by focusing on income as a single measurement for inequality, one
leaves out other important indicators of social inequality. This research has therefore 
broadened the scope of inequality by including educational, labor, and political inequality 
alongside economic inequality. It was examined whether these inequality indicators predict 
subjective well-being, and, if this effect is mediated by feelings of trust and fairness. A 
secondary quantitative data analysis was performed with data derived from the European 
Social Survey round 9 (2018) and parallel mediation analysis was performed using Hayes’ 
PROCESS macro. The sample consisted of Norwegian citizens above the age of 15 and 
contained 1406 participants. Results show that indeed non-economic inequality (educational, 
labor, and political) has a negative effect on subjective well-being and that this relationship is 
partially mediated by feelings of trust and fairness. Educational inequality negatively predicts 
SWB and does so through feelings of fairness, labor inequality predicts SWB through 
experienced trust, and political inequality’s influence on SWB is mediated by both trust and 
fairness. Furthermore, results show that income inequality does not significantly affect 
subjective well-being in this current study, an ambiguous result. This lack of significance 
could be due to lack of perceived inequality in Norway or to the operationalization of the 
concept. As the study contained secondary data, this issue could not be prevented. 
Regardless, this study shows the importance of the effects of non-economic inequality on 
subjective well-being, showing that reducing inequality should not merely be focused on 
income, but other societal inequalities as well. In order to achieve better societal 
psychological and physical health outcomes, decreasing non-economic inequality should 
therefore be high on the agenda."
Loneliness in the life course of older adults: a qualitative inquiry exploring loneliness in the life course of older adults (65+),"['Broekema, Joy']","['Wit, John de']",2022-10-24T14:00:38Z,EN,['life course perspective; experience of loneliness; interpretative phenomenological analysis; coping with loneliness; older adults'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Background: Loneliness is increasingly seen as a public health issue for older adults. Over the years, several interventions to alleviate loneliness have been developed. The evidence of the effectiveness of these interventions is inconclusive. The limited success of interventions may be caused by an insufficient understanding of the roots of loneliness. To gain a better understanding of loneliness in late adulthood, it may be helpful to take a life course perspective. This qualitative study contributed to the literature on loneliness by researching how older adults make sense of loneliness in their life course. More specifically, this study investigated how life events affect feelings of loneliness, how older adults perceive loneliness and how older adults utilize(d) coping strategies to manage or alleviate loneliness throughout their lives. Methods: 11 in-depth interviews were conducted among older adults between the ages of 68-88 with current or past experiences of loneliness. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used for the data analysis. Results: Findings show that there is not one way in which older adults make sense of their loneliness experiences, because participant’s life stories are very different. Loneliness is not confined to old age as participants identified a range of life events related to loneliness at different stages of their life course. Participants mentioned the interplay between life events, their perceptions of loneliness and how they coped when they talked about loneliness, emphasizing the importance of addressing these three topics to gain a comprehensive understanding of a person’s experience of loneliness. Conclusion: This study shed light on how life events affect loneliness, how loneliness is perceived by older adults and how older adults cope with loneliness. These insights emphasize the value of a life course perspective to increase our understanding of loneliness. These insights can contribute to the development of effective interventions to alleviate loneliness."
How Governance Influences Collaboration Between Scientific and Non-Scientific Stakeholders in Implementing and Evaluating Complex Interventions Regarding Health Issues,"['Knijnenburg, Ward']","['Kamphuis, Carlijn']",2022-10-24T14:00:44Z,EN,"['Collaboration, scientific vs non-scientific, governance']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Health problems affect everyone but people with a lower SES are more affected. Health problems can be addressed on different levels, however to target health problems efficiently it might be useful to target neighbourhoods where people with a lower SES live. This can be done via interventions where it is necessary to form a collaboration between scientific and non-scientific stakeholders. These kind of collaborations are new and not much research had been done. This research uses the theory of Governance from Hudson, et al. (1999)  to research these kind of collaborations. In order to do so interventions that use these kind of collaborations in Overvecht are being used as a sort of case study. Different stakeholders with either a scientific or non-scientific background have been interviewed to get their perspective on these collaborations. Semi-structured interviews have been used that have been structured in accordance with the most relevant concept from the theory of governance: task division, conflict, legitimate basis for collaboration, collaborative capacity, shared vision and trust. These concept have been used to answer the following research question: “Which factors as specified in the Hudson-framework on governance play a role in the collaboration process between scientific and non-scientific stakeholders?” All the factors from the theory of governance play a role in the collaboration process. Most in accordance with the theory from Hudson, et al. (1999). This research found that governance as a concept can be used to investigate these kind of collaborations, but also expended on the existing theory to make it more fitting to be used in social sciences."
Dealing with Double Diversity: Migrant parents’  experiences in accessing preschool services for their  children with disabilities,"['Hoitink, Dana']","['Hoogenboom, Marcel']",2022-10-24T14:00:42Z,EN,['Disability; Ethnicity; Preschool services; Barriers and  facilitators'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Little is known about the inclusion of migrants with

Considering the relevance of the education system in 
enhancing inclusion in society, this research addressed
this gap by focusing on migrant parents’ access to 
preschool services for their children with disabilities in 
Arnhem, the Netherlands. Data are collected by 
conducting qualitative interviews in 2021 with four
parents residing in Arnhem as well as twelve 
professionals employed in Arnhem in enabling and 
supporting parents’ access to the concerned services. 
Based on theoretical exploration, the interviews focused 
on the factors that expectantly influenced parents’ access
to preschool services. Parents appeared to experience
several hurdles in accessing the concerned services, on 
the micro-, meso- and macro-level of influence. This 
referred to hurdles related to finances as well as 
language proficiency, limited social networks, cultural 
disparities and difficulties of navigating new systems. In 
the interrelatedness of these barriers, limited skills in the 
receiving country’s language appeared to be the 
foundation of the difficulties, which seemed to negatively 
influence parents’ information position and the extent of 
their social networks. This, in turn, determined in 
conjunction with the nature of parents’ social networks –
the potential possession of negative social capital as well 
as the educational level of their ties – and norms about

Overcoming Climate Change Scepticism and Increasing Sustainable Behaviour Intentions,"['Bulck, Fieke van den']","['Bal, Michèlle']",2022-10-24T14:00:40Z,EN,"['Cimate change scepticism, sustainable behaviour intentions']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Climate change is a risk that affects environment, humans and future generations. There are climate change sceptics that do not believe that there is any risk, nor they believe other facts related to climate change, such as human contribution to global warming. As climate change scepticism has a detrimental effect on sustainable behaviour choices, we need to know how to overcome scepticism. Thus, this study aimes to understand climate change scepticism (CCS) from a worldview defense perspective and aims to investigate the role of hopeful and empowering messages on sustainable behaviour intententions (SBI) regarding willingness, planning and readiness. More specifically, this study investigated the moderating role of scepticism on these messages and SBI. Data was collected from 540 participants through a survey with an experimental approach. There are three conclusions. First, there was no difference in overall, trend, impact, attribution or efficacy scepticism between participants who watched a high threat video and participants who watched a low threat video. Participants scored higher on efficacy scepticism and lower on impact scepticism after watching a threat video. Second, some subgroups (e.g. 20-29 year olds, flexitarians) reported lower SBI after reading an article with a hopeful or empowering message. Third, efficacy moderated the effect of a message of hope and empowerment on SBI for some subgroups, such that higher efficacy sceptics reported lower SBI than lower efficacy sceptics. The negative response to the articles may possibly come from reactance that occurred after reading the articles. However, trend and attribution moderated the effect of the same message on planning intentions for omnivores and males, but in a positive direction."
"Differences in Pay-Satisfaction Between Single and Cohabiting Women in the Netherlands, Moderated by Gender Norms","['Visser, Charita']","['Wit, John de']",2022-10-24T14:00:33Z,EN,"['Pay satisfaction, Women, Gender norms, Cohabitation, Marriage']",Social Policy and Public Health,"One under-explored factor within women’s pay satisfaction is ‘cohabitation status’, referring 
to being single or in a cohabiting relationship. Existing literature suggests single women 
show relatively lower pay satisfaction compared to women in a cohabiting relationship. The 
social-ecological model is used as the theoretical framework in this research to study pay 
satisfaction in women from an interdisciplinary perspective. A moderator that might 
strengthen the relationship between pay satisfaction and cohabitation status, included in this 
research, is gender norms. Accordingly, the first research question is; “Is there a difference in 
pay satisfaction between women with different cohabitation statuses in the Netherlands?” and
if so, the second research question is “Do gender norms strengthen the relation between pay 
satisfaction and cohabitation status for women in the Netherlands?”. Many relevant factors 
are correlated to cohabitation status and pay satisfaction. While women in relationships show 
on average a higher relative pay satisfaction when controlled for their income, the regression 
analysis with control variables do not show a significant effect of cohabitation status on pay 
satisfaction. Gender norms did significantly effect this relationship, meaning women in a 
cohabiting relationship are more influenced by gender norms, compared to single women. To 
conclude, only one of the two main hypotheses could be fully confirmed. Further research is 
needed to explain how gender norms influence pay satisfaction and why women in a 
relationship show relatively higher pay satisfaction compared to single women."

types of welfare states succeed in diminishing health inequities among adolescents. In all 
welfare state types, a higher socioeconomic status was significantly associated with better 
health outcomes. Furthermore, it was found that in the conservative welfare regime the 
association between socioeconomic status and adolescent health is smallest, followed by the 
social democratic welfare regime and the liberal welfare regime. Together, these findings might

Multiple data collection methods are used to get a better understanding of the extent to which community competences are developed: Eleven semi-structured interviews are analyzed and complemented with a document analysis of the statutes from the initiatives and available news articles about the initiatives. The results suggest that both initiatives have to some extent developed all community competences. Differences in the degree to which the competences are developed can primarily be explained by the way the initiatives are organized. Both initiatives struggle with reaching everyone in their district to participate. They also experience bureaucratic issues when dealing with the communities."

Previous studies suggesting self-efficacy (SE) to promote performance guide this study’s focus on the SE of professionals (older than 18 years old, from all fields, nationalities and work experiences) who undergo CS training. Scientific findings and components of the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and the Trait Activation Theory (TAT) were the basis for the selection of variables possibly involved in the development of SE and for elaborating a conceptual model. The model involved a positive relationship between mindfulness and SE, with curiosity and specific-task performance (STP) as (partial and serial) mediators. A cross-sectional design with an online survey was implemented; quantitative analysis was conducted considering data of 88 participants who undertook a coaching skills simulation and a survey assessing their curiosity, mindfulness and SE. From a total of nine hypotheses, the results suggest support for one of them, showing a statistically significant positive relationship between STP and SE (at a 5% significance level). Thereby, the findings demonstrate initial evidence that CS might have the potential to improve professionals’ SE. However, the findings do not suggest that mindfulness and curiosity are positively related to SE (statistically non-significant relationships were found). Studying these variables in the context of virtual CS training is a novel aspect of this study."

It has been established that heightened worry and IU are transdiagnostic factors related to anxiety disorders. In contrast, mindfulness and self-esteem have been related to reduced anxiety. This study aimed to investigate whether the established findings of self-esteem and mindfulness remain significant when tested as moderators between IU and worry. This study was a cross-sectional study where participants were 434 bachelor's students of the behavioral science department of a Dutch university aged 18 – 58 years (M = 22; SD = 3.26). All constructs were assessed through self-report questionnaires. The two moderators' self-esteem and mindfulness were added individually stepwise before they were combined, which led to a total of three regression models. The results of the regression analysis did not support the moderator role of self-esteem and mindfulness (e.g., ΔR2 = 0.001, ΔF (3, 433) = 0,82, p = .365). More specifically, the main effects of self-esteem and mindfulness reduced worry; however, as moderators, they could not reduce the association between IU and worry. The results could not support the hypothesized effects, yet, supported the stance that self-esteem and mindfulness have a reducing tendency towards worry while IU has an increasing effect on worry and vice versa."

The research hypotheses were tested using team-level data collected from organizations that are geographically located in Germany, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Italy and operate in various sectors, ranging from healthcare to manufacturing. Team members rated team learning orientation, team reflexivity, team learning, team resilience, and the perceived impact of COVID-19 on team functioning.

Given the pervasive lifelong consequences associated with CSA and the health and well-being implications associated with sexual satisfaction, it is beneficial to examine underlying mechanisms of this relationship. The aim of the present study was to examine CSA as a potential factor associated with romantic attachment, and subsequently dyadic coping (DC) and sexual satisfaction. In a cross-sectional design, 221 women and men in committed romantic relationships completed an online self-report questionnaire assessing the variables of interest. Results of correlation analyses revealed no significant associations between CSA and romantic attachment, DC, and sexual satisfaction. Furthermore, results of a serial mediation analysis revealed that romantic attachment and DC did not (sequentially) mediate the relationship between CSA and sexual satisfaction. The current study adds to existing research by supporting the need for more comprehensive understanding of sexual satisfaction for women and men who experienced CSA. The findings raised by this study emphasize the need for a more complete understanding of the CSA-sexual satisfaction link. Future research recommendations include creating a more nuanced perspective on the circumstances and conditions within which CSA impacts sexual well-being as well as a more representative and diverse sample of both women and men of ages, sexual orientations, and ethnicities."

internalization of beauty ideals and whether this relationship is controlled by the 
‘perceived importance of beauty ideals’ and moderated by the ‘participants’ own beauty 
filter use’? Women between 18 and 35 years old (N = 103, M age= 22,77) filled out an 
online questionnaire and were exposed to AI-generated pictures of women either without
or with a beauty filter. Contrary to the expectations, it was found that there were no 
differences in participants’ internalization of beauty ideals when they were exposed to 
pictures without or with a beauty filter. Therefore, there was also no covariate or moderator 
found in this relationship. However, it was found that participants’ own perceived 
importance of beauty ideals and participants’ own beauty filter use were significant 
predictors for participants’ internalization of beauty ideals. Therefore, it is recommended 
that women will receive psycho-education about how they can protect themselves against 
the negative consequences of exposure to beauty ideals, by being less worried about beauty 
ideals and/or using fewer beauty filters themselves. This study has risen attention to the 
fact that women are not just victims of their online environment filled with beauty filters, 
but they can themselves have an influence on how they let this online environment affect 
them."

The current study is designed to test how these statements affect applicants’ P-O fit and subsequent job application behaviour and how this differs for minority (non-Dutch) and majority (Dutch) participants. The results of the study indicate that the relationship between the inclusion of D&I statements in job vacancies and subsequent job application behaviour is fully mediated by P-O fit and that the direct relationship between the independent and dependent variables is not moderated by participants’ nationality minority status. With these findings, the study contributes to previous research by confirming that P-O fit does lead to application behaviour and that the inclusion of D&I statements in job vacancies may not be as fruitful as previously believed, at least for younger generations in the highly internationalised context of the Netherlands. These findings can contribute to both research and practice by directing efforts further away from D&I statements themselves but rather towards P-O fit and its antecedents."
Itching for Affective Touch: Studying the Influence of Temperature and Velocity on Itch Reduction,"['Schwab, Lisa']","['Schielen, Zoë']",2022-07-22T00:00:58Z,EN,['chronic itch; affective touch; velocity of touch; temperature of touch; CT-fiber activation'],Neuropsychology,"Itch is an understudied and poorly understood symptom of various dermatological conditions for which treatment is still sparse. Research has shown that affective touch (AT), or touch delivered at 3 cm/s, exerts inhibitory effects on the sensation of itch. This relationship is seemingly sustained by low threshold unmyelinated mechano-afferents (C-tactile or CT) in the human hairy skin. The processing of temperature and velocity of touch is moderated by CT-fiber activation and is in turn hypothesized to mediate the degree of inhibition on itch. In the present study, we investigated whether theoretically optimal stimulation of CT-fibers (3 cm/s touch at 32°C) significantly increases their inhibitory effect on itch. A within-subjects design (N = 17) consisting of 2 x (touch: 3 cm/s, 18 cm/s) 2 x (temperature: 18°C, 32°C) x 7 (timepoints: VAS baseline and measurements) conditions was employed to compare the effect of velocity and temperature of touch on itch modulation. Itch was induced electrically, and touch was administered affectively (3 cm/s) or non-affectively (18 cm/s) at a temperature of 18°C or 32°C, respectively. Participants rated the development of itch seven times during six minutes and the pleasantness of touch once every condition, on a visual analogue scale (VAS). The results indicated that AT was significantly more effective in decreasing itch than the non-AT condition (p = 0.034). Notably, the relationship between itch and touch was not mediated by subjective pleasantness. However, the hypothesis that touch delivered at 32°C would be significantly better at decreasing itch could not be confirmed (p = 0.549). In sum, the present study highlights the relieving effect that slow caress exercises on itch and offers new insights into the relationship between itch and touch."

and the prolonged grief disorder, by examining to what extend optimism relates to 
fluctuations in daily life of grief symptoms “avoidance” and “difficulty moving on”, and to 
what extend optimism relates to symptoms levels of the prolonged grief disorder.
Methods: An experience sampling method study was conducted. Bereaved people 
underwent a clinical interview after which they answered grief-related questions for two 
weeks, five times a day, on the Ethica app. 
Results: The results indicated that participants with higher trait optimism showed less 
fluctuations in grief symptoms “avoidance” and “difficulty moving on” of the prolonged grief 
disorder according to the DSM- 5-TR. Furthermore, the results showed that there was a 
negative correlation between optimism and overall symptom level of the prolonged grief

Conclusion: The results of the current study could have important clinical 
implications for enhancing our understanding of mechanisms of distress following loss and 
the potential usefulness of optimism in treatment of the prolonged grief disorder."

The Dual Process Model of grief (DPM) explains how loss leads to Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) in some individuals, but not in others. The objective of this study was to test predictions provided by DPM by studying the oscillation between periods of presence and absence of grief, and predictors for grief experience.
Methods. This study employs a comparative n-of-1 design with experience sampling method, focusing on two bereaved individuals, one with, and one without PGD. Measurement of potential predictors included company, place, activity, and pleasure during activity. 
Results. Oscillation of grief was found in the case without PGD, whereas the case with PGD continuously experienced grief. For the case without PGD, a predictive model was constructed using the activities, with periods of rest or sleep predicting the highest grief, followed by periods of household activities or hobbies, and work or social activities predicting the lowest experienced grief. For the case with PGD, no meaningful predictive model could be constructed.
Discussion. Existence of oscillation and possibility of modelling grief experiences was shown as hypothesized in the case without PGD, and differed from the case with PGD, which was also hypothesized. The outcomes are encouraging for DPM."

In het publieke en wetenschappelijk debat is zelfs sprake van een kloof.

Toch stellen sommige academici dat de kloof overbrugd kan worden door deliberatieve participatie-instrumenten in te zetten als institutionele toevoeging op het representatieve democratische systeem, om zo de democratie als geheel te versterken. Theoretische handvatten om de wisselwerking tussen deliberatieve participatie-instrumenten en de representatieve democratie te kunnen verklaren, zijn voorhanden. Echter, de empirische toetsing van deze handvatten aan de hand van historische casussen ontbreekt nog in het debat. Dit onderzoek tracht niet alleen het functioneren van nationale burgerfora in Nederland bloot te leggen, maar ook de wisselwerking tussen deliberatieve democratie en representatieve democratie te kunnen verklaren.

De empirische toetsing en vergelijking van beide burgerfora, aan de hand van vier indicatoren, tonen grote overeenkomstigheid in hun falen en de grote rol die representatieve instituties daarin speelden. De analyse leert dat burgerfora alleen kans van slagen hebben, als representatieve instituties hun onvoorwaardelijk steun en vertrouwen uitspreken én verlenen bij de institutionele inbedding van het instrument en haar uitkomst."

By examining the wider historical context of Irish Independence (1921) and the ensuing Civil War (1922-1923), I hope to shed light on the way in which post-colonial and fascist ideology interacted in the emergence and failure of this movement. In this thesis, I look at the way Irish political identities were historically constructed and how these devolved into a rehearsal of colonial dialectics in the civil war and during the formation of the Irish Free State. Dispute over the Anglo-Irish Treaty that brought independence led to civil war, leaving a deeply ingrained oppositionality in the politics of independent Ireland: pro-treatyite against anti-treatyite. In the 1930s, the resurgent anti-treatyites peacefully took power and the Blueshirts represent a desperate attempt by the pro-treatyites to challenge the increased dominance of their opponents. By exploring the role of colonial dialectics in the emergence of the Blueshirts, I argue that the palingenetic mythic core of fascism was used in an attempt to challenge the monopoly anti-treatyites had achieved over the Irish nationalist tradition of revolutionary republicanism. My examination of the Blueshirts reveals opportunistic motivations behind the embrace of fascist aesthetics and rhetoric by the pro-treatyites, but also the limitations of fascism as a tool to marshal populist support. Through a discussion of why fascism failed in this particular case-study, I hope to offer a better understanding of fascism as an ideology and the post-colonial construction of Irish political identities."
Balancing the Scale of Financial Wellbeing in the Great Northern Coal Field 1920-1950,"['Simpson, Catherine']","['Nederveen, Elise van']",2022-07-23T00:00:55Z,EN,['Financial Wellbeing; social history; mining; financial literacy; financial coping strategies; industrial society; poverty management'],History,"The goal of this research project is to reconstruct the financial wellbeing of those living in a working-class community to examine if there was a distinct difference in how finance was managed. This thesis, will answer the research question; how did closed mining communities in the Great Northern Coal Field manage their financial wellbeing between 1920-1950? It will do this by arguing that financial management within closed working-class communities was a multifaceted affair that often relied on a vast array of different long- and short-term, monetary, and non-monetary strategies and tactics. By combining individual, household, and community strategies the villages were able to insure themselves against external austerity policies, poor wages, and dangerous working conditions. They were able to carve out their own way of life, independent from 
the paternalistic and often oppressive policies of the mining companies by utilising a combination of 
physical, social, and cultural capital. Furthermore, while both genders contributed to the 
development of the management of finance, women played a unique role within the household and 
community. They exercised significant control over the resources and acted collaboratively when 
necessary to expand resources to insulate their communities and reduce financial instability. By 
acting cooperatively, married mining women managed to protect their community and family unit
by monitoring money flows and engaging in complex social systems to provide them with informal 
insurance in times of economic strain."

De Desolate Boedelkamer, waar Amsterdamse faillissementen werden afgehandeld, was een van de instituties die bijdroegen aan het ontwikkelen van de Amsterdamse kredietmarkt. In deze scriptie wordt onderzocht of faillissementen van actoren op de kredietmarkt met elkaar in verband kunnen worden gebracht. De bankencrisis van 1763 vormt de casus waarin wordt onderzocht of, en hoeveel, domino-effecten tussen faillissementen voorkwamen. Uit het uitblijven van deze effecten wordt geconcludeerd dat de Amsterdamse kredietmarkt verrassend schokbestendig was."

Van deze twee groepen, Papoea’s en Molukkers, zijn enkele honderden naar Nederland gemigreerd in 1962 en 1963. In het historiografisch debat is deze migratie echter een voetnoot en nog nooit vergeleken. Dat terwijl een onderzoek naar deze twee groepen ervoor kan zorgen dat er over deze bladzijde van de Nederlandse geschiedenis meer kennis is.
 
Met behulp van relevante migratietheorieën en primaire bronnen uit het Nationale archief die betrekking hebben op de migratie van beide bevolkingsgroepen, betoogt deze scriptie dat de organisatie van Molukkers en Papoea’s in Nederland een grote rol heeft gespeeld op de toelating van het Nederlandse migratiebeleid. Molukkers waren beter georganiseerd in de RMS en daardoor lukte het hen om een kort geding te winnen waardoor meer Molukkers konden migreren naar Nederland. Papoea’s waren minder goed georganiseerd en daardoor lukte het hen niet om meer Papoea’s te laten migreren."

This thesis investigates the preferred method for discovering new music for Generation Z. Specifically, how algorithms recommendation systems have influenced the process of discovering new music and if they have replaced social connections as the preferred method. There is also an emphasis on researching how social connections have changed with the arrival of new technologies. 

To answer the research question, an online survey was distributed to young people between the ages of 18 to 28. The results showed that social connections and technologies that involve algorithms are Generation Z’s top method for discovering music. Media has lost popularity compared to previous studies. Finally, social connections are still present and now also include new technologies like playlists to share music."

They can do so in several manners, where stimulating reflection is considered particularly relevant. With only half of Dutch children meeting nutrition guidelines, health literacy is considered an important learning domain. However, to date it remains unclear how the interaction between agent/robot and child should be designed, especially in those domains. A systematic literature review showed that agents and robots are employed in various domains with various behaviors, but that only a small number of papers focus on reflection and/or health. To design a learning session with a robot that incorporated both, a human-centered design approach was adopted. This involved the creation of personas, scenarios, and reflection strategies, which resulted in a dialogue design for a learning session about healthy nutrition. The reflection strategies were evaluated during a between-subjects experiment (N = 28), consisting of a condition in which a social robot stimulated reflection on learning goals and learning progress, and a control condition, in which these reflection strategies were not employed. The outcome measures consisted of 1) recall of the learning goals, 2) learning outcomes, and 3) motivation to eat healthily. The former two measures were assessed on two occasions: directly after the session (short-term) and one week later (long-term). No significant results were found. However, the control condition showed a stronger decrease in scores over time. Future work is recommended to employ multiple sessions with the robot to stimulate reflection more effectively and to assess long-term effects."
We Are the Ones They’ve Been Waiting For: Exploring the Rise of the Tea Party Movement and the Securitization of ‘American Exceptionalism’ During Barack Obama’s First Presidential Term,"['Ferretti, Peter']","['Pechlivanis, Paschalis']",2022-07-23T00:03:05Z,EN,['American Exceptionalism; Tea Party Movement; 2013 federal government shutdown; Copenhagen School; Societal Security'],International Relations in Historical Perspective,"Drawing on the theoretical framework of Societal Security as understood by the Copenhagen School of Security Studies, this thesis examines the securitization by the American Right of American Exceptionalism during the first term of the Obama administration. The framework of Societal Security allows scholars to explore threats to identity, and the framework’s explanatory tool of securitization theory provides a ‘grammar of security,’ as a means to understand the consequences of the extreme politicization of threats to identity. This thesis demonstrates that the Tea Party Movement was able to successfully position Barack Obama himself and policy makers in his administration more broadly as a threat to national identity. In particular, it emphasizes the American Right’s use of rhetoric espousing the ideational migration of European-style welfare programs as a threat to national identity. In order to explore the significance of this threat, it presents two empirical case studies: the emergence of American exceptionalism as a referent object in Obama’s first term, and second, the Tea Party Movement’s campaign against the ‘Europeanization of America,’ culminating in the 2013 shutdown of the federal government."
Securitising the Threat from Within?,"['Witte, Anouschka']","['De Vita, L.']",2022-07-23T00:03:10Z,EN,['neo-Nazism; Germany; preventative measures; securitisation processes; case studies'],International Relations in Historical Perspective,"How did Germany securitise neo-Nazism over the past decades? The major threat of neo- Nazism has haunted Germany for a long time and several scholars have criticised the German approach to combat neo-Nazism by referring to Germany’s “blind eye” toward neo-Nazism and even suppose that Germany is underestimating its impact. However, an extensive identification of the security threat perceptions, preventative measures, and key actors to understand the German approach toward neo-Nazism is lacking up to this point. Based on an extensive analysis of the annual reports by the German domestic intelligence agency, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV), and a comparison of two neo-Nazi attacks before and after the German reunification, this thesis will try to fill this gap. Specifically, the ideas and narratives of the BfV were analysed by applying Securitisation Theory to identify how the BfV perceived and reacted to neo-Nazism from 1990 till 2020. Further evidence was found by comparing the Munich Octoberfest bombing in 1980 and the Halle attack in 2019. While the annual reports revealed that the BfV did securitise and acted upon the neo-Nazi threat throughout the years and indicated a more optimistic view compared to previous research, the case study comparison slightly nuanced this impression as the Octoberfest bombing of 1980 was somewhat less securitised with fewer preventatives measures compared to the Halle attack of 2019. Through these analyses, this thesis adds a key understanding of Germany's security thinking and preventative approach toward neo-Nazism to grasp how Germany acts upon and perceives the threat today."

utilizes the Greek politicians’ motives and the written questions addressed by the politicians to 
the Commission and the Council, the other two institutions involved in the EU’s enlargement

argument is that Greece used the process to fulfil national interests, through the European 
Parliament. This pressure exertion incommoded the process, thus leading to its longevity. The 
results indicate that the Greek politicians tried to raise concerns regarding Turkey’s

Classifying literary works according to their language and/or the nation the author belongs to is outdated. It ignores the increasingly complex national and linguistic positioning of, for instance, multilingual and immigrant authors. In this thesis, I uncover the lack of tools to study texts positioned in the grey area, not belonging to any category. Therefore, I provide a new concept, the heteronymic speaker, to better analyze these specific texts. Firstly, I show the necessity for this concept through the study of Fernando Pessoa’s transnational anglophone poems. Secondly, I apply the heteronymic speaker as a close-reading tool to analyze Yara Rodrigues Fowler’s bilingual novel Stubborn Archivist. My discussion of these texts using the heteronymic speaker leads to the conclusion that monolingual and national literary categorization is now obsolete and restraining. It is necessary that literary scholars question this system of classification and participate in the formulation of a new framework and tools adapted to the study of multilingual texts and authors."

Wij vertroetelde cultuurmenschen,"['Bakker, Roald']","['Schalbroeck, Eva']",2022-07-23T00:02:55Z,NL,['Moderniteitskritiek; identiteit; de Ander; fin de siècle'],Cultuurgeschiedenis van modern Europa,"Deze scriptie analyseert hoe in Nederland tijdens het fin de siècle (1880-1910) in verschillende vormen (etnografische voorstellingen, reisverslagen en romans) de interactie met de ‘natuurlijke Ander’ werd gebruikt om moderniteit te bekritiseren en de eigen identiteit te versterken. Allereerst is onderzocht hoe Nederland tijdens de eeuwwende moderniseerde en hoe hierop gereageerd werd. De perceptie van een (te) snelle verandering zorgde bij een minderheid van de bevolking voor een gevoel van sociale ontwrichting waardoor de identiteit van mensen bedreigd werd. Deze groep idealiseerde de niet-witte mens, omdat deze volgens hen in een natuurstaat zou leven en daarom gelukkiger zou zijn. De interactie met ‘de Ander’ werd gebruikt om de eigen, moderne maatschappij te bekritiseren om zodoende vat te krijgen op de zo gevoelde veranderende wereld en eigen identiteit.
In drie vormen van interactie met de niet-witte mens blijkt dat er kritiek werd geuit op de moderniteit. Op nuances na kwam de kritiek in de drie vormen met elkaar overeen. De niet-witte mens werd beschouwd als ‘natuurlijk’, kreeg een sterk lichaam toegeschreven en werd omschreven als onveranderlijk, zorgeloos, gelukkig en mystiek. Ook de nijverheid van de niet-witte mens werd beschouwd als zuiver omdat hier geen sprake was van massaproductie. De moderne mens werd hier tegenover gezet, die over dit ‘natuurlijke’ niet meer beschikte. Dit werd beschouwd als nadelig. Volgens de beeldvorming bleek steeds dat de moderne mens fundamenteel verschilde van de ‘natuurlijke Ander’. Het benadrukken van dit verschil diende om de eigen identiteit te versterken. In de bronnen zag men zichzelf en de eigen samenleving steeds als modern en daarmee als ontwikkeld, rationeel, industrieel, materialistisch en losgekoppeld van de natuur. Het moderne werd steeds gekoppeld aan een breder Europees of westers kader. Meer zelden werd er een specifiek Nederlandse moderne identiteit versterkt.
Tussen de vormen van interactie met ‘de Ander’ is verschil gebleken. Vooral bij de romans was de moderniteitskritiek impliciet. Bij de etnografische voorstellingen en reisverslagen was dit concreter, mede omdat de eigen ervaring werd verwerkt. Bij etnografische voorstellingen was de kritiek het meest duidelijk omdat er steeds voorbeelden uit de eigen samenleving werden gebruikt. Bij de reisverslagen was dit minder het geval en bij de romans volledig afwezig."

Dans om het gouden kalf.

De Israëlieten aanbidden het gouden kalf en ongehoorzamen God. In de Nederlanden is dit verhaal door kunstenaar Lucas van Leyden (1494- 1533) in ca. 1530 voor het eerst afgebeeld in de schilderkunst. In deze periode nemen de religieuze twisten in West-Europa toe. In 1566 leidt dit tot een kantelpunt met de Beeldenstorm. Hervormers als Luther, Erasmus en Calvijn uitten kritiek op afgoderij, beeldverering en de misbruik van afbeeldingen. In de zeventiende eeuw zijn meer Nederlandse schilderijen gemaakt met het thema de dans om het gouden kalf. Hoe verhouden deze schilderijen zich tot de Beeldenstorm? Om deze reden staat de volgende onderzoeksvraag centraal: ‘In hoeverre kunnen verbeeldingen van het Bijbelverhaal ‘Dans om het gouden kalf’ uit de zestiende en zeventiende -eeuwse Nederlandse schilderkunst in verband worden gebracht met de doorwerking van het iconoclasme?’
De selectie Nederlandse schilderijen met als thema de dans om het gouden kalf uit de zestiende- en zeventiende eeuw tonen onderling zowel overeenkomsten als verschillen. Sommige kunstenaars hebben het gouden kalf op de voorgrond afgebeeld, terwijl andere kunstenaars het kalf op de achtergrond van het schilder hebben geplaatst. Middels visueel en iconografisch onderzoek blijkt dat sommige kunstenaars het Bijbelverhaal hebben aangegrepen om een feestende menigte vol zonde en wereldse verleiding af te beelden. De verbeelding van het Bijbelverhaal in de Nederlandse schilderkunst toont veel picturale overeenkomsten met het populaire zeventiende -eeuwse feestthema, het Bijbelverhaal ‘de verloren zoon’ en het gezegde ‘zonder wijn en eten bevriest de liefde’. De verleidelijke vrouw is een opvallend aspect en wortelt zich in het ‘verraad’ van Eva tijdens de zondeval, de oerlist van de vrouw. Aan de hand van eigentijdse schildertraktaten blijkt dat kunstenaars zich bewust waren van de verleidelijke krachten van kunst en welk effect een schilderachtige werkelijkheid heeft op de toeschouwer. Gesteld kan worden dat de schilderijen waarbij de feestvierende en verleidelijke Israëlieten op de voorgrond zijn afgebeeld nauwelijks in verband kunnen worden gebracht met het iconoclasme. Het is aannemelijk dat de schilderijen waarbij de dans om het gouden kalf op de voorgrond is afgebeeld, zonder elementen van verleiding, wel een zekere doorwerking tonen van het iconoclasme."
Investigating Dark Pattern Blindness,"['Sluijpers, Matthias']","['Nimwegen, Christof van']",2022-07-28T01:01:14Z,EN,[],Human-Computer Interaction,"Dark patterns are questionable design choices that are made to steer users towards business-preferred outcomes. As there are many different types of dark patterns, this raises the question of what dark patterns are truly unacceptable and what dark patterns are somewhat more tolerable. There are several aspects that could be used to help answer this question. One of these aspects is dark pattern blindness: a phenomenon where users do not recognize a dark pattern that they are exposed to. The first and main research aim of the current study was to investigate to what extent dark pattern blindness occurs for a selection of different dark patterns. In addition, Bergman (2021) developed the System Darkness Scale (SDS) to measure the perceived “darkness” of a system. The second research aim was to investigate whether the scale can differentiate between system versions with dark patterns and system versions without dark patterns (other than the two system versions that were used when developing the scale). To this end, three systems were created, each with a version with and without dark patterns. An online experiment was conducted where participants were assigned to two of these systems - one of which would always be a version with dark patterns and the other would always be a version without dark patterns - and performed two short real-world tasks. Subsequently, the participants evaluated the systems using the SDS and answered a set of questions about whether they had noticed any dark patterns. The results show that several dark pattern instances had a relatively low recognition level, whilst several other dark pattern instances had a relatively high recognition level. However, these results cannot be generalized to a wider population - amongst others, due to the small sample size - nor to other instances of the investigated dark pattern types. In addition, for each of the three systems, the evaluation of the SDS could not establish whether or not the scale is able to differentiate between the version with dark patterns and the corresponding version without dark patterns. Several pointers are provided for future research."
Between trust in science and Cold War ideologies: Polio prevention through the lenses of the Italian press in the 1950s and the 1960s,"['Volonteri, Micol']","['Wille, Robert-Jan']",2022-07-28T01:00:45Z,EN,['polio vaccination campaigns; Italy; newspapers; Cold War'],History and Philosophy of Science,"The outbreak of viral diseases has always elicited widespread fears in the public audience and great media attention. Furthermore, the management of sanitary crises worldwide was and still is influenced by several factors, including scientific-based data, political decisions, media narratives and economic interests, strictly bound to the historical background. To shed some light on the complex intertwining among these elements, this Master thesis zooms in on the specific case study related to polio prevention in Italy in the 1950s and in the 1960s, by examining the articles published by two Italian newspapers, the Corriere della Sera and the l’Unità. While reporting about polio prophylaxis, they mediated among science, politics, ideologies and the economic interests underlying the commercialization of polio vaccines. These dailies represented two opposite ideological stances during the Cold War period, respectively the liberal-conservative and the communist ones. Therefore, they dealt with the matter about polio vaccines by embedding it in both domestic and foreign sanitary policies aimed at tackling the spread of polio. By analysing the international debate on polio immunization campaigns and its connection with the Cold War framework, this research aims at demonstrating how the Italian case study perfectly mirrors, at a “micro level”, the intricate web of powers operating internationally during the Post-war period. Furthermore, it fosters some considerations upon the role of the USA and the USSR during the Cold War. These countries should no longer be considered as two hermetically closed systems, but rather as two closed systems interacting in an open context, as they also used to be interconnected one with another and to mutually influence. Finally, this thesis provides some general insights to critically inquire and interpret some aspects of other epidemic and pandemic crises, their management and their narratives carried out by the principle media."

deze scriptie zijn drie recente mediadebatten onderzocht die betrekking hebben op diversiteit en inclusie

hoe deze zich verhoudt tot de notie van de poortwachter. De deelnemers aan de mediadebatten komen
van zowel binnen als buiten het uitgeversvak. Uit de analyse is gebleken dat de pleitbezorgers van meer
diversiteit en inclusie in het literaire veld niet alleen de selecterende functie van de uitgeverij
benadrukken, maar ook haar capaciteit om ruimte te bieden aan maatschappelijk relevante thema’s,
kansen te creëren voor groepen die structureel worden achtergesteld en daar financiële beloningen
tegenover te stellen. Critici houden veelal vast aan een meer traditionele visie op de uitgeverij, waarin
zij in de eerste plaats verantwoordelijk is voor het brengen van literaire kwaliteit. Uitgevers en
redacteuren schipperen in hun uitingen tussen deze twee posities, maar erkennen wel overwegend de
verantwoordelijkheid die de uitgeverij heeft in het inclusiever maken van de literaire wereld. In het
hedendaagse debat over diversiteit en inclusie en het literaire veld wordt de uitgeverij dus een taak
toegeschreven die verder gaat dan het bewaken van de poort: zij creëert kansen in het literaire veld, stelt

The Optimizable Self: How Fitbit Shapes an Ideological Understanding of the Body,"['Theunissen, Hymke']","['Karreman, L.L.']",2022-07-28T01:00:47Z,EN,['Self-tracking; Self-Optimization; Fitbit; Ableism; Normality; Dispositif'],"Media, Art and Performance studies","In this thesis, I analyze the phenomenon of using self-tracking technologies to optimize the body. Specifically, I focus on how the Fitbit health and fitness tracker shapes an ideological understanding of the body. First, I discuss the debate on self-tracking and self-optimization by focusing on the themes that define this practice. These include the process of datafication that turns bodily activities into data, how this works as an intervention that shapes ideas about health and fitness, what kind of subject position this creates, and how this process can turn health into an ideology. Second, I introduce my own perspective on self-tracking practices to show how self-tracking devices play a role as cultural artifacts in creating ideas around ‘normal’ bodies. I introduce the field of disability studies, focused on how the cultural model of disability turns the focus away from considering disability itself, to analyzing how normality is constructed through the concepts of ableism, the normate, and compulsory able- bodiedness. Third, I connect this perspective to a media analysis by showing how a self-tracking practice can be approached as a dispositif, consisting of the user, the technology, and the text. Finally, I conclude the dispositif analysis based on three points. One, I show how the Fitbit convinces its user of the credibility of its measurements. Second, I present a performative understanding of the Fitbit, as a device that brings a worldview into being when it is worn. Third, I show how Fitbit presents a paradox because while it aims to broaden the understanding of strength, its commercials do not part with a physical understanding, and its technology assesses all bodies based on one specific type of body. This highlights that Fitbit aligns with compulsory able-bodiedness, where the able-bodied position is ultimately considered best. This thesis underscores the importance of critically evaluating technologies as key players in shaping ideas of what normal bodies are."
Random Forest for lake ice detection using Sentinel-1 SAR data,"['Elsen, Max van den']","['Gravey, Mathieu']",2022-07-28T01:01:20Z,EN,['SAR; Random Forest; Machine Learning; Remote Sensing; Sentinel-1; Ice Detection; Classification'],Applied Data Science,"Climate change is one of the greatest challenges humanity is presently facing. Lake ice is an important indicator of assessing climate change and provides a range of social and economical activities. Therefore, accurate
and highly temporal resolution monitoring is important. Machine learning in remote sensing is a widely
used research method in climate change detection. However, when it comes to lake ice monitoring optical
remote sensing becomes unfeasible due to cloud contamination. Therefore, Sentinel-1 SAR is a proposed
data source to overcome this problem as it has the ability to acquire images during day and nighttime and it
can penetrate clouds. Furthermore, a few lake and sea ice studies have been carried out using Sentinel-1 SAR
data. Nevertheless, most of the studies were performed locally and models were not tested to be generalizable. This research aimed to test the generalizability of a random forest model by training on four different
study areas using Sentinel-1 SAR data. Also, the influence of external features (e.g. texture extracted using a
Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), wind, spatial) were studied. The validity of the model was assessed
using three different approaches to test local performance, overall performance, and the generalizability. The
model achieved an average local accuracy of 84%. In contrast, the performance using a generalized method
showed an average accuracy loss of 15% ranging in accuracy from 58% till 76%. To examine the influence
of external features different feature combinations were determined and used as input for the models. The
wind features improved the local models which indicated that these features are part of the characteristics
of the study area and therefore not generalizable. Texture and spatial features didn’t contribute to the model
at all. This can be explained by the small size of the lakes included in the study area and the noisy images.
From this it can be concluded that the random forest model is not readily applicable to other lakes and that
the backscatter features of the Sentinel-1 SAR data are the only consistent generalizable features that were
established during this research. Recommendations for further studies are to include many more study areas
in the model and to define until what local extent a model is accurate and reliable."

This thesis posits time travel fiction as a valuable space for exploring reparation and underlying questions about history, responsibility, memory, and temporality. In order to gain a better sense of the contributions literature can make to debates about reparation and historical injustice, the thesis presents a close reading analysis of three works of time travel fiction: Octavia Butler’s Kindred (1979), Zetta Elliott’s Genna & Judah novels (2010; 2016), and Diana Gabaldon’s Drums of Autumn (1997). Through the time travel device, these novels each reflect on mediated practices of commemoration and embodied forms of remembrance. They also present a more nuanced model of temporality than the commonly assumed linear and progressive one, allowing for a better understanding of responsibility over time. Lastly, they emphasize the need to start any effort at repair by acknowledging the specific and contextualized needs of those affected by injustice, questioning the efficacy of top-down processes of reparation. Though focusing on the history of slavery in the U.S., the thesis has implications for any context in which reparation for or after historical injustice is being sought."
"Extreem-laagfrequente (ELF) en radiofrequente (RF) elektromagnetische velden (EMV), blootstelling van buschauffeurs in elektrische- en dieselbussen.","['Groot, Remi de']","['kromhout, Hans']",2022-07-29T00:01:07Z,NL,['Elektromagnetisch velden (EMV); xtreem-laagfrequente elektromagnetische velden (ELF-EMV); Radiofrequente elektromagnetische velden (RF-EMV); EMDEX Lite; ExpoM-RF; Radman 2XT; Buschauffeur; Electromagnetic fields (EMF); Extreme Low Frequency Electro Magnetic Fields (ELF-EMF); Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields (RF-EMF); Bus driver'],Toxicology and Environmental Health,"Een aantal buschauffeurs van een vervoersbedrijf in het zuiden van Nederland ervaart gezondheidsklachten sinds de overgang in 2019 van diesel naar elektrische bussen. Sommige chauffeurs zijn van mening dat blootstelling aan elektromagnetische velden in de bus van de accu’s, de WiFi en mobiel bellende passagiers hieraan ten grondslag liggen. De vakbond en het busbedrijf hebben daarom het Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences van de Universiteit van Utrecht gevraagd om dit te onderzoeken. Dit heeft geresulteerd in de volgende onderzoeksvraag: 

Wat is de blootstelling aan Extreem-laagfrequente (ELF) en Radiofrequente (RF) Elektromagnetische velden (EMV) van buschauffeurs in rijdende elektrische bussen en niet-elektrische bussen?

Hiertoe is een persoonlijke blootstellingsstudie uitgevoerd. Over een periode van twee werkweken zijn chauffeurs vrijwillig uitgerust met dosimeters. Deze meters werden gedurende de gehele werkdag gedragen. Chauffeurs hielden bij wanneer zij van bus wisselden. Er kon onderscheid gemaakt worden tussen elektrische bussen voor korte of lange afstand en dieselbussen. Gegevens als leeftijd en aantal werkjaren van de chauffeurs zijn ook meegenomen in het onderzoek. Er zijn verschillende typen dosimeters gebruikt om zowel de extreem laagfrequente als radiofrequente elektromagnetische velden in kaart te brengen. De ELF-EMV metingen zijn verricht met EMDEX Lite dosimeters en de RF-EMV metingen met de ExpoM-RF en de Radman 2XT dosimeters. Er is bij 78 chauffeurs de blootstelling gemeten op in totaal 144 werkdagen. De gemeten blootstellingen aan elektromagnetische velden zijn vergeleken tussen de drie gebruikte bus typen en afgezet tegen de meest recente richtlijnen zoals vastgesteld door de International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). De frequentiebanden in het RF-gebied zijn gegroepeerd op basis van toepassing van de verschillende frequenties. Dit resulteerde in zeven frequentiebanden. Deze zijn vergeleken met de laagste richtlijn per frequentieband. 

Uit de metingen is gebleken dat de gemiddelde blootstelling aan ELF-EMV op een werkdag (0,11 µT) ruim binnen de ICNIRP-richtlijn ligt (<0,001%). Wel is een 35% significant hogere blootstelling aan ELF-EMV gevonden bij chauffeurs van lange afstand elektrische bussen ten opzichte van de korte afstand elektrische- en dieselbussen. Ook was de tijd ≥0,4 µT tot 15 keer langer in de lange afstandsbussen (gemiddeld 12 minuten per werkdag). Door roulatie van de chauffeurs over de verschillende bussen en routes zijn echter geen verschillen in gemiddelde blootstelling aan ELF-EMV  tussen de chauffeurs gevonden. 

Ook de gemeten blootstelling aan RF-EMV (141 µW/m2¬) lag ruim binnen de ICNIRP-richtlijn (0,72%). De RF-blootstelling bleek voor 82% afkomstig van mobiel telefoon- en dataverkeer, 10% van de boordradio en communicatie met de centrale en 8% van de Wi-Fi en overige bronnen. Langere verblijfstijden van de chauffeurs in elektrische bussen resulteerden in hogere blootstellingen aan RF-EMV van mobiel telefoon- en dataverkeer, communicatie en radio. Deze toename bedroeg 6-11% per extra uur in een elektrische bus.  De gemiddelde blootstelling aan RF-EMV anders dan aan ELF-EMV, verschilde wel tussen de chauffeurs. Dit is waarschijnlijk het gevolg van verschillen in persoonlijk mobiel telefoongebruik. 

In de huidige situatie uitgaande van de geldende ICNIRP-richtlijnen zijn geen schadelijke gezondheidseffecten (ten gevolge van opwarming van weefsel) te verwachten bij de buschauffeurs. Dit geldt voor zowel de blootstelling aan ELF-EMV in elektrische bussen als voor de blootstelling aan RF-EMV afkomstig van mobiel telefoongebruik, radiocommunicatie en de Wi-Fi."
Zijn meer gemeentelijke belastingen de oplossing voor de geldnood in Nederlandse gemeenten?,"['Geurink, Nathan']","['Vis, Barbara']",2022-07-29T00:00:59Z,NL,['fiscale autonomie; stabiliteit; gemeentelijke financiën; decentralisatie; gemeentelijke belastingen; gemeenten; kantons;'],Bestuur en beleid,"Na de decentralisatie van de jeugdzorg, WMO en participatiewet in 2015 hebben veel gemeenten te maken gehad met tekorten in het sociale domein, doordat de bijdrage vanuit de Rijksoverheid voor veel gemeenten niet de kosten dekte. Veel gemeenten hebben de afgelopen jaren daarom bezuinigingen doorgevoerd of hun reserves aangesproken. Het vergroten van de inkomsten door belastingtarieven van gemeentelijke belastingen te verhogen is een beperkt gebruikte optie om tekorten mee te compenseren, omdat gemeentelijke belastingen maar goed zijn voor een klein deel van de inkomsten van Nederlandse gemeenten. Wanneer een gemeente een tekort wil opvangen door meer belastinginkomsten, dan zal het de belastingtarieven daarom al snel relatief stevig moeten verhogen. In de gemeente Opmeer werd het tarief voor de onroerendezaakbelasting in 2021 bijvoorbeeld met 41% verhoogd om de tekorten in de jeugdzorg en WMO op te vangen, nadat de gemeente in de jaren daarvoor haar reserves al had aangesproken en zoveel had bezuinigd dat belangrijke faciliteiten nog net niet hoefden te worden gesloten. Uiteindelijk heeft in 2021 een arbitragecommissie bepaald dat het kabinet de rijksbijdrage aan de gemeentelijke uitvoering van de jeugdzorg in ieder geval structureel en fors moet verhogen.
In de zeven jaar tussen de decentralisatie en de forse structurele verhoging van de rijksbijdrage aan het sociaal domein hebben gemeenten echter veel reserves aangesproken en bezuinigingen doorgevoerd. Het is de vraag hoe dit in de toekomst zou kunnen worden voorkomen. In Nederland is er in vergelijking met een land als Zwitserland nog veel ruimte om de fiscale autonomie te vergroten. Hoe meer fiscale autonomie decentrale overheden hebben, hoe meer ze zelf kunnen bepalen welke soort belastingen ze heffen en welke tarieven ze daarbij hanteren. Uit eerder onderzoek is al gebleken dat het decentraliseren van fiscale autonomie niet leidt tot een concurrentiestrijd tussen overheden in het verlagen van belastingen, maar dat er variatie zit in de belastingtarieven, waardoor ze meer zelf kunnen bepalen hoe ze tekorten compenseren. Voor Nederlandse gemeenten zou meer fiscale autonomie dus een interessante mogelijkheid kunnen zijn die tot meer stabiliteit van inkomsten en uitgaven zou kunnen leiden. In dit onderzoek is de stabiliteit van de inkomsten- en uitgavenposten van Nederlandse gemeenten rond de decentralisatie van 2015 daarom vergeleken met de stabiliteit van de inkomsten- en uitgavenposten van Zwitserse kantons rond de decentralisatie van het speciaal onderwijs in 2008 aldaar. De stabiliteit is in dit onderzoek gedefinieerd als de gemiddelde jaarlijkse verandering van het budget ten opzichte van het voorgaande jaar. Dit is berekend voor de totale uitgaven, het budget voor het gedecentraliseerde beleidsdomein, de budgetten voor de andere beleidsdomeinen en de totale inkomsten. 
Uit de data-analyse blijkt dat de fiscale autonomie de stabiliteit van inkomsten- en uitgavenposten rond een decentralisatie in dit onderzoek niet significant heeft vergroot. Voor de totale uitgaven had de fiscale autonomie zelfs een significant negatief effect op de ontwikkeling van de budgettaire stabiliteit, al was dit effect maar klein. Bij de budgetten voor de andere beleidsdomeinen dan het gedecentraliseerde beleidsdomein wees het verschil tussen de Nederlandse gemeenten en Zwitserse kantons wel duidelijk in de richting van een betere ontwikkeling van de stabiliteit als gevolg van meer fiscale autonomie, maar dit verschil was niet significant groot. De resultaten van dit onderzoek bieden dus geen aanleiding om Nederlandse gemeenten meer fiscale autonomie te geven. Om met meer zekerheid conclusies te trekken over het effect van fiscale autonomie op de stabiliteit van inkomsten- en uitgavenposten is het echter van belang om meer onderzoek hiernaar te doen. Dit onderzoek kan daarbij worden gebruikt."
"Initial erosion-deposition patterns in a sheltered coastal environment: the role of wind, waves, tides and graded sediment","['Hoegen, Roel']","['Price, Timothy']",2022-07-31T00:00:59Z,EN,"['Graded sediment transport, Nature-based solutions, Numerical modelling, Delft3D, sheltered coastal environment, mixed-energy system, morphodynamics']",Marine Sciences,"Nature-based sandy coastal protection measures are becoming increasingly more important as a sustainable alternative for hard engineering protection works (e.g. dikes, sea walls and breakwaters). Currently, most sandy coastal interventions are sited at open-ocean coastal systems and consist of a uniform sediment mixture (e.g. ‘Sand engine’ at the Holland coast). However, there is also a need for sustainable coastal protection measures in more sheltered coastal environments such as estuaries, deltas and bay-side beaches. In addition, natural coastal systems often consist of a wide range of sediment sizes which can substantially alter the morphodynamic processes. Therefore, it is essential to understand the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes to predict the evolution of sheltered coastal interventions with non-uniform sediments.

This study applies the widely used morphodynamic Delft3D model to study the sediment transport dynamics of such a system. The ‘Prins Hendrikzanddijk’ (PHZD), situated on the bay side of the Texel barrier island in the Dutch Wadden Sea, is used as a prototype system for a sheltered coastal intervention with non-uniform sediments. A Delft3D model is set up for the PHZD and the hydrodynamics are extensively calibrated with wave height and velocity data from a 6-week field campaign. The design of the model experiments is twofold: 1) the environmental boundary conditions are systematically varied to identify the role of different drivers (waves, tides, winds) on sediment transport, 2) the number of sediment sizes and initial bed composition is varied to
determine the role of graded sediments and the bed composition on sediment transport. In order to model the bed composition changes, a multi-layer bed stratigraphy module is applied.

The results show that the sediment transport is a function of the wind velocity, wind direction and the geometry of the basin. During moderate energetic conditions, the orbital wave motion dominates the bed-shear stress. However, for more extreme storm conditions, the wind- and wave-driven currents become increasingly more important. With an increasing number of sediment fractions, the total sediment transport converges towards a larger suspended transport and a smaller bed load transport compared to a single fraction. Furthermore, the process of preferential transport, hiding and exposure effect and bed armoring are modelled by the multi-layer bed stratigraphy. Nevertheless, the hydrodynamic conditions are of greater importance for the bed evolution than the bed composition as there is little difference in bed level changes for an initial fine or a coarse bed composition. In addition, it is shown that the initial vertical bed composition is crucial for bed composition changes. However, the multi-layer bed stratigraphy model threats the sediment transport as diffusive fluxes while the observations show the deposition of discrete layers. Therefore, the model is not able to reproduce the observed vertical sorting."
Agent & Algoritme,"['Bok, Margot ten']","['Grimmelikhuijsen, S.G.']",2022-07-30T00:00:38Z,NL,"['Algoritme, Artificial Intelligence, Transparantie, Morele verantwoordelijkheid']",Public Management,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is overal om ons heen. Ook de Politie ziet mogelijkheden om werk op straat veiliger, vollediger en efficiënter te maken met behulp van AI. Door deze focus op efficiëntie komen echter andere waarden zoals transparantie, rechtvaardigheid en responsiviteit onder druk te staan (Schiff, Schiff & Pierson, 2021). Door onder andere deze gebrekkige transparantie verdampt de verantwoordelijkheid in de complexe relaties rondom algoritmes (De Fine Licht & De Fine Licht, 2020). Dit is zorgelijk, want om een organisatie verantwoordelijk te kunnen stellen moeten de individuen die in die organisatie werken zich ook verantwoordelijk voelen. 

Een mogelijk toekomstig hulpmiddel dat gebruik maakt van algoritmes is de bevragingsassistent. De bevragingsassistent is een digitaal hulpmiddel dat gebruik maakt van clusteralgoritmes, dat agenten ondersteunt doormiddel van het leveren van specifieke informatie over personen. Adequate informatievoorziening van agenten is belangrijk, omdat het kan voorkomen dat agenten of verdachten in gevaarlijke situaties belanden. Hoewel AI-systemen in staat zijn om objectieve ondersteuning te bieden, ze kunnen de beslissingen van de agent ook beïnvloeden (Zerilli et al., 2019). Dit doet de vraag rijzen waar precies tussen agent en algoritme de verantwoordelijkheid ligt. Om hier meer inzicht in te krijgen staat de volgende onderzoeksvraag in dit onderzoek centraal: Wat is het effect van algoritmische transparantie op de ervaren morele verantwoordelijkheid van gebiedsgebonden Politieagenten?

Deze vraag is onderzocht doormiddel van een surveyexperiment. In het experiment werden twee groepen gescheiden: 1) een groep die scenario’s kregen te zien met een lage mate van algoritmische transparantie en 2) een groep die scenario’s kregen te zien met een hoge mate van algoritmische transparantie. Algoritmische transparantie is in dit experiment gerealiseerd door een combinatie van een tekstuele visualisatie en een korte uitleg. Aan dit experiment hebben 153 agenten deelgenomen. Na het doorlopen van de scenario’s moesten de agenten vragen beantwoorden die gingen over het toekennen van een juist of onjuist antwoord aan zichzelf of aan de bevragingsassistent. Deze schaal is gebruikt om het concept ervaren morele verantwoordelijkheid te operationaliseren. 
Uit de resultaten blijkt het antwoord op de onderzoeksvraag drieledig te zijn: 
1.	Algoritmische transparantie heeft geen effect op de ervaren morele verantwoordelijkheid
2.	Algoritmische transparantie zorgt wel voor meer begrijpbaarheid van het systeem en het zorgt ervoor dat fouten in een AI systeem niet onopgemerkt blijven
3.	Agenten baseren hun oordeelsvorming op basis van verschillende informatiebronnen. De oordeelsvorming van agenten en de ervaren morele verantwoordelijkheid die daaruit volgt moet daarom in een informatie-ecologie gezien worden. 

Op basis van deze bevindingen zijn inzichten opgedaan voor zowel de wetenschap als de praktijk. Zo schuilt er een risico voor toekomstig onderzoek dat onderzoekers in een ‘tunnelvisie’ alsmaar opzoek gaan naar een geschikt middel om algoritmische transparantie te realiseren, om ervaren morele verantwoordelijkheid te bewerkstelligen, terwijl het effect ervan er niet of nauwelijks lijkt te zijn. Daarnaast heerst er in de praktijk van de Politie een dominante focus op de technologie, waardoor de sociale context overschaduwd wordt. Het is belangrijk dat de bevragingsassistent uiteindelijk in de informatie-ecologie van de agent past. Deze inzichten worden tot slot meegenomen in concrete aanbevelingen voor vervolgonderzoek en de praktijk van de Politie."

Research suggested that a high degree of competence and autonomy are essential for SDL, which is a key factor influencing the ability of lifelong learning (LLL). Implementing LLL is part of the long-term plan of the fire brigade. In this study, 64 firefighters from Amsterdam-Amstelland were randomly assigned to one of three conditions either a group with one choice, a group with three choices, or a group with seven options of choice. A between-subjects design was executed to compare the degree of self-directed learning between participants of the different groups. The questionnaires that were used for this study, were from previous studies and consisted of seven items on self-directed learning, nine items on perceived competence, and seven items on autonomy. ANOVA analyses were executed. The results indicate there is a significant effect of perceived competence on SDL, no effect of autonomy on self-directed learning, a negative moderating effect of autonomy on the relation between perceived competence and learning self-directed learning, and a questionable relationship between autonomy and perceived autonomy."
Feathers as Biomonitor for Heavy Metal Pollution,"['Horst, Toon ter']","['Goerlich, Vivian']",2022-07-29T00:01:03Z,EN,['Heavy Metal Toxicity; Feathers as Biomonitor for Heavy Metal Pollution; Feather Detoxification; The European Raptor Biomonitoring Facility'],Environmental Biology,"Heavy metals are a group of pollutants that pose a threat to life on earth, including to us humans. One way to study disturbances in ecosystems is through a process called biomonitoring, in which organic material is used to measure changes in ecosystems. An example of a biomonitor is bird feathers, which can be treated in such a way that heavy metal content can be analysed using spectroscopy. The scope of this review was to answer the following research question: “Can feathers be used as biomonitors for heavy metal pollution?”. In addition, this study aimed to investigate what potential challenges exist for this process. By studying previously conducted research, the dangers of a subset of heavy metals were investigated, as well as the mechanisms regarding how metals accumulate in feathers and whether previous research demonstrated measuring heavy metal concentrations by using feathers. This review found that it is indeed possible to measure heavy metals in feathers. However, to successfully deploy feathers as biomonitors and use them to make comparisons between the heavy metal concentrations in different areas or periods, standardization of methods is necessary (e.g., use of the same feather type, use of feathers from birds of the same age and feathers picked at a similar moment during the moult). Bird feathers have the potential to supply us with valuable information on the levels of pollutants like heavy metals and may therefore function as valuable alarm calls for protecting the health of life on Earth."
Using State Evaluation and Artificial Neural Networks to solve the Firefighter Problem,"['Lambooij, Nikè']","['Leeuwen, Erik Jan van']",2022-07-29T00:00:57Z,EN,['Firefighter Problem; State Evaluation; Artificial Neural Networks;'],Computing Science,"The Firefighter Problem (FFP) on graphs is a model for fighting the spread of a fire through a city. At each time step d nodes can be defended from the fire, before the fire spreads to all undefended nodes adjacent to a burning node. In this thesis we investigate the application of State Evaluation to this problem, creating an ANN called SEANN for this purpose. We also describe a second neural network, called CLANN that solves FFP more directly by classifying which node should be protected at the current time step. To solve the FFP we created several solvers that use some form of State Evaluation, and we compare these to the optimal solution found by solving an ILP model and to a greedy algorithm in case of trees. Our experiments show that State Evaluation works very well for FFP, especially a Greedy State Evaluation algorithm that uses a Greedy Look-ahead algorithm to evaluate potential future states. The CLANN network, however, performs worse than basic greedy heuristics."

functioning of children and a healthy lifelong development. Children with maladaptive emotion regulation skills 
experience more often peer problems and tend to report more social anxiety. In addition, children who exhibit 
more social anxiety are more likely to experience peer problems. This cross-sectional study (N = 168) examined 
whether social anxiety (SCARED-NL) mediates the relationship between maladaptive emotion regulation 
(DERS-16) and peer problems (SDQ), and whether this mediation-model is moderated by gender (n girls = 106) 
and/or age (M = 14.3 years). The data was collected by administering an online survey to children aged 8 to 18 
years. To investigate the relationships, a mediation model with double moderation was used. The positive and 
significant relationship between maladaptive emotion regulation and peer problems was indeed mediated by 
social anxiety symptoms, however no support for the moderators age and gender were found. A possible 
explanation for not finding the moderating effects in the current study could be the sample size and distribution. 
The insights from this research are relevant for clinical practice, such as indicated preventions for learning 
adaptive emotion regulation strategies. However, further research needs to be conducted with a larger, more

The effect of light in combination with shocks on the physical stability of infusion bags with monoclonal antibodies,"['Janssen, Marieke']","['Mastrobattista, Enrico']",2022-08-03T00:01:03Z,EN,['monoclonal antibodies; pembrolizumab; infliximab; physical stability'],Farmacie,"Aim: It is known that incorrect storage or mishandling of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could lead to
aggregation and in the worst case to immunogenic reactions. Therefore, conditions as temperature,
light exposure, and exposure to shocks during manufacturing and storage are well monitored and the
effect of it is known. Little is known about the effect of these stress factors during administration, for
instance when a patient goes on an outside walk. For that reason, the aim of this study was to
investigate the effect of light in combination with shocks on the physical stability of infusion bags with
monoclonal antibodies.
Materials and methods: Infusion bags were prepared with leftover reconstituted vials of infliximab
and pembrolizumab. They were exposed to several types of stress, namely light, shocks and light in
combination with shocks. There also was a group of mAb infusion bags that was not stressed
(unstressed). Each group also contained 2 NaCl 0.9% infusion bags without anything added to measure
background particles. After stressing the infusion bags, they were analysed with dynamic light
scattering (DLS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and micro-
flow imaging (MFI). Statistical analysis was done with a one-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD post-hoc test
or Brown-Forsythe and Games-Howell post-hoc test depending on the result of Levene’s test for
equality of variances.
Results and interpretation: In the nanometer range exposure to light seems to negatively influence
the physical stability of both infliximab and pembrolizumab based on the results of DLS and SEC. This
was only significantly proven for pembrolizumab with SEC (p = 0.007). For NTA no reliable results were
obtained. In the micrometer range no general effect could be found for infliximab and pembrolizumab.
However, MFI detected significantly higher particle concentrations for shocks (p = 0.002) and light
combined with shocks exposure (p = 0.002) compared to unstressed for pembrolizumab. Regarding
the requirements of the Pharmacopoeias for parenteral formulations infliximab exposed to any stress
factor could still be used, but pembrolizumab exposed to any stress factor could not be used anymore.
Despite these requirements further research is needed before administering these products to
patients. For example, biological activity should be tested and other analytical techniques that can
detect around 1 μm should be used.
Conclusion: This study was not elaborated enough to conclude if infliximab and pembrolizumab can
still be administered to patients. However, based on this study, it seems that infliximab and
pembrolizumab are both potentially sensitive to light in the nanometer range. To say something about
the effect of light in combination with shocks on the physical stability of all mAbs more research is
necessary. So, the effect of light in combination with shocks on the physical stability of mAbs remains
unknown."

However, the factors that lead students to select one instructional video over another are still unknown. This study investigated the importance of three design factors that could affect students' willingness to watch an instructional video: video style, length, and format. Video style refers to the presentation format, such as the presence/absence of an instructor and layout of the video. Video length consists of the duration, while format indicates whether the video is presented as a whole or divided into smaller chunks. One hundred one students participated in the study, choosing 20 out of 80 video thumbnails varying in the above variables, and answering questions to explain their reasoning. The analysis showed a significant medium effect for video style, favoring Khan style. The main cited reasons were that the presence of an instructor is distracting, it is
suitable for certain topics, and visuals enhance comprehension. As for video length, no statistically significant effects were found regarding a video being 6 or 10 minutes long. A small significant effect was found for video format, favoring not-segmented videos. These were preferred because of their suitability for certain topics, a lack of need to divide initially short videos, and the practicality of having the information in one place. Based on the findings, it is advisable to create Khan-style videos and not divide them if they are already short."
