Predicted Unpredictability: Temporal Discounting as an Appropriate Response to Growing Up in Resource-scarce and Neglectful Environments - Unpredictability Schemas as a Potential Mediator,"['Tapper, Noah']","['Frankenhuis, W.E.']",2023-08-24T00:00:55Z,EN,['Contextually appropriate response perspective; CARP;  deprivation; childhood neglect; resource scarcity; unpredictability schemas; temporal discounting'],Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"A growing body of literature suggests that adverse environments can produce a larger spectrum of outcomes than suggested by the traditional deficit approach. The present study investigated experiences of resource-scarce and neglectful environments, two aspects of deprivation, as predictors for temporal discounting in the decision-making of youth. Informed by the contextually appropriate response perspective (CARP), unpredictability schemas were investigated as a mediator between adverse experiences and temporal discounting. Regression and mediation analyses were conducted on questionnaire data of 534 youth from a middle school and five after-school clubs in Salt Lake City, USA. The 49% female sample had a mean age of 13.6 (range 12-18), it was socioeconomically and ethnically diverse but predominantly White and Hispanic. Results indicated evidence for childhood neglect and resource scarcity as predictors of unpredictability schemas. While childhood neglect predicted the use of temporal discounting, resource scarcity did not. There was no evidence for an unpredictability schema as a mediator, which was not aligned with predictions based on the CARP. Direct implications for the CARP are minor. Future studies should utilize the potential of the perspective and add to the evidence so that more impactful conclusions can be drawn. Several strengths, limitations, and recommendations for future research on the CARP are discussed. Investigating adversity exposure from multiple viewpoints is essential to find an adequate balance of impairment, strengths, and rationality in our view of adversity-exposed youth. Finding mechanisms of environmental adaptation is crucial to building policies and interventions that reduce socioeconomic gradients in adaptive developmental outcomes."
CONFLICTING FRAMES OF COMPLIANCE. A Frame Analysis of Compliance with the Recovery and Resilience Facility and the Housing Market in the Netherlands.,"['Oostvogel, Jinke']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-08-24T00:01:02Z,EN,[],Public Administration and Organisational Science,"This thesis conducts a frame analysis to systematically map the frames used in the political debate about compliance with the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) in the Netherlands, using housing in the Netherlands as a case. The Netherlands lobbied for strict fiscal rules and compliance with the Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs) for other Member States, yet Dutch compliance is low. There is tension caused by the conflicting attitude the Netherlands had toward strict compliance with CSRs for other Member States while not wanting to be confronted with the same strict requirements themselves. Notably, for the housing crisis, the mortgage interest deductibility and the issue of private debt are not addressed in the Dutch Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP). The frame analysis is conducted by abductively analyzing parliamentary plenary debates between January 1st and July 8th, 2022. This period was selected because it starts with the establishment of a new parliament and ends with the submittal of the RRP, thus being the period in which the RRP was created and debated. The current analysis integrates several frame elements from multiple academic disciplines and sources, namely frame type, (de)politicizing, the type of usage, and the type of logic. This thesis thereby creates a new, systematic method for frame analysis in public administration. The thesis finds that the debate can be divided into 1) frames employed by the coalition to justify their policies through depoliticizing, emphasis frames, legitimizing usage, and justification logic; and 2) frames employed by the opposition to criticize a) the coalition policies, and/or b) European economic governance and integration. The opposition parties use politicizing, emphasis frames, cognitive usage, and influence logic to this end. This thesis contributes an integrated and practical framework for frame analysis to public administration scholars and a systematic overview of the conflicting debate for practitioners."
(Burger)zoektocht naar vertrouwen,"['Geurts, Geanne']","['Schillemans, Thomas']",2023-08-24T00:00:58Z,NL,[],Bestuur en beleid,"Burgers zijn sinds enkele jaren steeds actiever betrokken bij de opsporing van een deel van deze personen. Er zijn inmiddels meerdere (semi)professionele vrijwilligersorganisaties die structureel deelnemen aan zoekacties naar een deel van de ongeveer 40.000 personen die jaarlijks vermist raken. Meerdere organisaties doen dit in samenwerking met de politie. Het opbouwen van vertrouwen is cruciaal voor het succes van deze relaties. Vertrouwen kan helpen bij het behalen van betere uitkomsten en hogere efficiëntie. Daarom beoogt dit onderzoek inzicht te verschaffen in de relatie tussen coproductie en vertrouwen van burgers in de politie bij zoekacties naar vermiste personen. 

In dit verkennende en beschrijvende onderzoek wordt de volgende onderzoeksvraag beantwoord: “Op welke wijze verhouden coproductie en vertrouwen zich tot elkaar onder burgers die deel uitmaken van vrijwilligersorganisaties die de politie helpen bij (het organiseren van) burgerzoekacties naar vermiste personen?” Om de onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden is een casestudy uitgevoerd waarbij vrijwilligers binnen twee burgerorganisaties zijn vergeleken. De geselecteerde casussen verschillen op verschillende organisatiekenmerken, maar met dezelfde uitkomst: beide organisaties werken samen met de politie. Dit onderzoek is kwalitatief uitgevoerd door semigestructureerde interviews af te nemen bij vrijwilligers van beide organisaties. 

Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat respondenten om meerdere redenen betrokken zijn geraakt bij de opsporing van vermiste personen. Vrijwilligers van beide organisaties zijn aangetrokken door een gemeenschap die past bij hun omgeving of achtergrond. Daarnaast willen meerdere vrijwilligers families van vermisten helpen en een maatschappelijke bijdrage leveren. De hoogte van hun vertrouwen in de politie aan de start van hun participatie verschilt. Hieruit kan geconcludeerd worden, dat het hebben van veel initieel vertrouwen voor meerdere respondenten geen vereiste was voor burgerparticipatie. Over het algemeen spreken respondenten van de tweede organisatie positiever over hun initiële vertrouwen in de politie. Binnen de eerste organisatie geeft de helft van de respondenten (kernteamleden) aan dat hun vertrouwen in de politie is gegroeid vanwege meer inzicht in het werk van de politie en een soepelere samenwerking. De andere helft van de respondenten (vooral algemene vrijwilligers) beschrijft weinig verandering in vertrouwen. Binnen de tweede organisatie geeft een kleine meerderheid aan dat hun vertrouwen is gegroeid om vergelijkbare redenen als bij de eerste organisatie. Mogelijk hangt de rol die vrijwilligers spelen binnen de organisatie samen met het verschil in vertrouwenseffecten gedurende de participatie."
Effect of Biological Determinist Explanations of Transgender Identity and Inner Dialogue on Tolerance Towards Transgenders,"['Karkili, senanur karkili']","['Oosterwegel, Annerieke']",2023-08-24T00:00:56Z,EN,[],Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"The term ""transgender"" refers to persons whose gender identity differs from their biological sex, which was assigned at birth. In Turkey, identifying as transgender or engaging in any other action that leads to deviating from heterosexual standards is viewed as evil, immoral, or abnormal, resulting in Turkey ranking 47th out of 49 European countries in the LGBT equality rating according to ILGA-Europe. This prejudice impacts many elements of transgender people's lives in Turkey, including their mental health, with %65 of Turkish transgender youth reporting poor mental health. This study investigates at how engaging in inner dialogue between opposing I-positions and knowledge on the biological basis of transgender identity affects tolerance towards transgenders. A pre-post-test design with control, biological determinism, and inner dialogue conditions was used on 224 Turkish youth aged 16 to 25. Before and after each condition, the ATTI scale was used to assess tolerance towards transgender people. In addition, after the inner dialogue condition, the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale was employed to see if it influenced the tolerance increase in this group. The Kruskal-Wallis Test and then Dunn's Test was used to examine the level of tolerance increase between conditions. The analyses suggested that both biological determinism and inner dialogue condition resulted in tolerance increase with a significant effect. Furthermore, a greater tolerance for uncertainty was not significantly associated with higher tolerance increase in the inner dialogue condition."
The influence of self-esteem on emotional stability and regulation during language processing,"['Slors, Tycho']","['Klaus, Jana']",2023-08-24T00:01:08Z,EN,"['Self-esteem, emotional differentiation, language processing']",Applied Cognitive Psychology,"This paper aimed to see whether self-esteem positively influences emotional stability, regulation, and recovery and how this was manifested in language processing. To measure emotional stability, participants performed an intelligence task which was manipulated to create the perception of failure. The hypothesis was that lower self-esteem participants would feel more distress since self-esteem correlates positively with emotional stability. Following this disturbing experience, participants completed a lexical decision task (LDT). The second hypothesis, based on (Schuch et al. 2017 and Krone et al. 2002), predicted that participants with lower self-esteem would exhibit a more negative mood after failure due to less effective emotion regulation strategies. Due to the phenomenon of preferential responses to mood-congruent stimuli, it was anticipated that participants with lower self-esteem would exhibit faster reaction times on negative words, relative to neutral words, in the LDT.
The results of this experiment contradict the initial hypothesis. Self-esteem did not improve emotional stability after the disturbing experience of failure. Moreover, higher self-esteem was even correlated with faster reaction times on negative words, relative to neutral, in the LDT.
Other research (Kernis 1993, 2013; Baumeister 2003) suggests that individuals with higher self-esteem tend to exhibit more defensiveness and demonstrate lower levels of acceptance following a failure. The observed results of the conducted experiment show a closer alignment with this theory compared to the theory on which the initial hypothesis was based."

Developing a Dialogue-Based Assessment Method for Depressive Disorder in Adolescents: A Qualitative Research on the Opportunities and Challenges for Integration into Practice,"['Kroes, Kim']","['Frommel, J.']",2023-09-06T09:41:27Z,EN,"['Digital interventions, serious games, depressive disorders, dialogue-based assessment method, integration into practice']",Science and Business Management,"Interest in digital interventions for depressive disorders has grown, yet limited usage exists in practice despite many limitations of the current interventions for assessment. My thesis aimed to explore the opportunities, challenges, strategies, considerations, implementation improvements and general limitations associated with integrating a dialogue-based assessment method for depressive disorders into practice. In this assessment method, adolescents engage in a conversation with a non-player character that asks the player about their experience with symptoms of a depressive disorder. Based on a thematic qualitative analysis with semi-structured interviews (N=6), the findings of this research revealed a range of insights. Opportunities included potential stimulation of honest responses, more reliable measurements, enhanced engagement and extra diagnostic support. Challenges involved high workloads, resistance from practitioners and finding funding. The strategies and considerations for successful implementation encompassed creating clarity on usage, linkage with the current system and writing implementation plans. Implementation improvements suggested changes to the storyline and characters but also further questioning symptoms, while also changing the target group and the questionnaire the dialogue is based on. Finally, the remaining limitations revealed difficulties with the heterogeneous and comorbid nature of depressive disorders and challenges related to using questionnaires as a base for the assessment method. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the integration of a dialogue-based assessment method for depressive disorders into practice, providing insights for future research to better bridge the gap between digital interventions and clinical practice."
The ESG score impact on Financial Performance and Capital Structure of the Firm,"['Jnead, Moulham Al']","['Kaakeh, Mohamed']",2023-09-06T09:41:42Z,EN,['ESG scores; financial performance; capital structure; sustainability.'],Financial Management,"This research paper delves into the examination of the influence that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores of companies have on their financial performance and capital structure. With the increasing worldwide focus on adhering to environmental regulations, sustainable finance has emerged as a crucial area of contemporary economic studies. Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between a company's ESG score and its financial performance and capital structure. To achieve this objective, a quantitative methodology is employed, utilizing a dataset encompassing 807 private and public firms across diverse industries in four Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Norway) as well as Germany. The findings of this research paper will contribute to the understanding of the impact of ESG scores on companies' financial performance and capital structure, providing insights for investors, policymakers, and stakeholders interested in sustainable finance and responsible investment practices."
Innovative disruption and the choice between market and bank debt capital,"['Rand, Josh Du']","['Lugo, Stefano']",2023-09-06T09:41:44Z,EN,['Innovative disruption; debt choice; credit risk; logit model'],Banking and Finance,"Innovative disruption stemming from the acceleration in technology-related innovations in the past two decades raises the question of how a firm’s choice between market and bank debt capital is affected. By applying logistic and fixed effect (FE) regression models to panel data of U.S. firms, observed during the period from 2006 to 2022, this study reveals that disruption risk leads to incumbent firms, ceteris paribus, relying more on bank debt financing. While it is not clear from these findings if credit risk is the only channel through which disruption affects debt choice, disruption risk is shown to increase credit risk. This research also finds that innovative disruption leads to proportionately more bank debt financing for more opaque firms, ceteris paribus. There is no evidence of firm-level innovation moderating the relation between disruption and debt choice."
Can The Negative Non-Verbal Behaviours Of Peers Predict Depression?,"['Urbanowicz, Maja']","['Beek, Yolanda van']",2023-09-06T09:41:41Z,EN,['Social Skills Deficit Model; adolescence; depression; non-verbal behaviours of peers; bias in perceived rejection'],Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"This study investigated a fragment of the Social Skills Deficit Model (SSDM), specifically, how both rejection, in terms of negative peer non-verbal responses, and negative cognitions, in terms of bias in perceived rejection, could predict future depressive symptoms. The following hypotheses were formulated: (1) The negative non-verbal peer responses, such as less gazing while listening, less gazing while speaking, less smiling and more negative behaviours, predict depression (2) The negative bias in perceived rejection predicts depression (3) The negative bias in perceived rejection mediates the relationship between non-verbal responses from peers and depression (4) Those effects are expected to be more prominent in girls, than boys, and younger adolescents, from 12 to 15 years old, than older adolescents from 15 to 17 years old. In this study, the dependent variable is the highest depression score in waves 2-4. The independent variables are the non-verbal behaviours of peers and bias in perceived rejection. In a longitudinal design, the data was gathered from 170 participants aged 12-17 from two Dutch Secondary Schools in 4 waves approximately nine months apart. The first hypothesis was partially supported, as the results have shown that less peer gazing while listening was a significant predictor of future increase in the depressive symptoms in the respondent. The second, third and fourth hypotheses were not supported by the data, since a bias in perceived rejection was not found to predict depressive symptoms, nor there were any sex or age interactions."

This was set out in the following research question: “What are companies’ organizational responses to the implementation of a non-financial reporting mandate?” 11 in-depth interviews with executives closely involved with the development and publishing of the non-financial report were conducted. It was found that overall companies respond with enthusiasm at first, involving top-level management, seeing it as something that is inescapable in nowadays society. They start preparing by setting up several initiatives regarding ESG team development, starting initial reporting initiatives, and increasing ESG actions before the directive's entry into force. Gaining insight in these previously underexposed antecedents of organizational change following a non-financial reporting mandate adds to existing literature regarding the financial and non-financial effects of non-financial reporting."

The inverse Galois problem with minimal ramification,"['Jager, Mees']","['Karemaker, Valentijn']",2023-09-06T09:41:28Z,EN,[],Mathematical Sciences,"Various authors have studied variations of the inverse Galois problem over Q, which, in its classical form, asks for a finite group G if there exists a number field K such that its Galois group over Q is G. Boston and Markin conjecture that every group G should appear as the Galois group of a number field which ramifies at exactly d primes (counting the infinite prime), where d denotes the minimal number of generators of the abelianisation of G. They prove the validity of their conjecture for all groups up to order 32. We provide examples of this conjecture for groups with cyclic abelianisation and we illustrate how to use these to construct examples of order larger than 32. Harbater, Hoelscher and Pollak give a description of the Galois groups that can appear for number fields where a single predetermined prime is ramified. They respectively focus on the primes 2, 3 and 5 and we give a similar description of the possible Galois groups that can appear for the primes 5<p<23. Furthermore, Pollak proved for primes p<37 that, if G is a Galois group of a number field where only p ramifies and |G|<660, then G must be solvable. We strengthen
this result by implementing one of the approaches of Pollak in GAP and obtaining an improved range of p<101 and a larger set of options for |G|."

Effect of complex pharmacist-led intervention combined with dose reduction to improve adherence to phosphate binding drugs in  hemodialysis patients with hyperphosphatemia: a process evaluation,"['Halfman, Vera']","['Gemmeke, M.']",2023-09-06T10:08:47Z,EN,['fosfaatbinders; hemodialyse; therapietrouw;'],Farmacie,"Introductie: Hyperfosfatemie is een veel voorkomende complicatie bij hemodialysepatiënten.
Om de fosfaatspiegel onder controle te houden, moet de dialyse goed zijn ingesteld, zijn er
dieetaanpassingen nodig en kunnen er fosfaatbinders worden gebruikt bij eiwitrijke
maaltijden. Echter, zijn patiënten vaak niet therapietrouw aan de fosfaatbinders. Met dit
onderzoek willen we kijken wat de effecten zijn van een complexe interventie en dosis
optimalisatie van fosfaatbinders bij hemodialysepatiënten met ongecontroleerde
hyperfosfatemie. Verder willen we kijken hoe de interventie toegepast kan worden in de
standaard zorg.
Methode: Het is een single center interventie studie, met een within-patient pre-post design.
De studie is uitgevoerd in het Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland, Rotterdam. Patiënten met een
fosfaatspiegel ≥ 1,5 mmol/L en het gebruik van 6 of meer fosfaatbinders kunnen geïncludeerd
worden. De interventie bestaat uit minimaal 3 visites. Tijdens de eerste visite wordt er
gekeken of de patiënten problemen hebben met de therapietrouw aan fosfaatbinders. Om dit te
onderzoeken worden er verschillende vragenlijsten gebruikt. Tijdens het tweede gesprek
worden er adviezen gegeven om de therapietrouw te verbeteren en verder wordt het aantal
tabletten verlaagd, door de dosering van de fosfaatbinders te halveren. De fosfaatspiegel aan
het begin van de studie en na de interventie wordt met elkaar vergeleken. Daarnaast wordt de
effectiviteit van de implementatie van de interventie onderzocht. Dit wordt gedaan door
gebruik te maken van de implementation fidelity theory. Verder zijn er 2 nefrologen, 1
verpleegkundig specialist en 6 patiënten geïnterviewd.
Resultaten: De studiepopulatie bestond uit 68 hemodialysepatiënten uit het Franciscus
Gasthuis & Vlietland, Rotterdam. Er was geen significant (p= 0.523) verschil in de
fosfaatspiegel tussen de waarde op baseline en na de interventie van 3 maanden. Wel is het
gelukt om het aantal fosfaat binders te verlagen, het gemiddelde aantal fosfaatbinders daalde
van 8.7 naar 4.8. Patiënten hadden voornamelijk een gebrek aan kennis over fosfaat en de
fosfaatbinders. Verder hadden veel patiënten problemen met farmaceutische literaire
vaardigheden. 47% van de patiënten kon niet lezen of begrijpen wat er op het etiket stond,
deze patiënten wisten dan niet waar ze de fosfaatbinders voor moesten gebruiken. 51% van de
patiënten had problemen met communicatieve vaardigheden, dit houdt in dat ze moeite
hebben met stellen van vragen of aangeven van zorgen bij zorgverleners. En 78% van de
patiënten had problemen met kritische gezondheidsvaardigheden, dit houdt in het opzoeken
van informatie en het beoordelen van de betrouwbaarheid van deze informatie. Verder werd er
gekeken naar de therapietrouw van de patiënten deze was significant (p=0.004) verbeterd na
de interventie. Ten slotte werd er gekeken naar de effectiviteit van de implementatie van de
interventie. Patiënten waren tevreden met de visites en gaven aan dat ze meer wisten na de
visites over hoog fosfaat en de fosfaatbinder. Uit de interviews met de nefrologen kwamen
verschillende punten, bijvoorbeeld over wie verantwoordelijk is voor de interventie en welke
patiënten geschikt zijn voor de interventie.
Conclusie: De gemiddelde fosfaatspiegel veranderde niet significant na de interventie, wel is
het gelukt om het aantal fosfaatbinders te verlagen. Ook werd het implementatie proces
geëvalueerd. Bijna alle interventie componenten werden uitgevoerd zoals gepland. De
beperkte effectiviteit van de interventie komt dus niet door een mindere implementatie van de
interventie. Verder kwam er uit het onderzoek dat veel patiënten problemen hebben met
farmaceutische literaire vaardigheden."
USING PRIMING INTERVENTIONS TO INCREASE RETIREMENT SAVINGS BEHAVIOR FOR SERVICE MEMBERS IN THE MILITARY RETIREMENT SYSTEM,"['Jarosch, Lena']","['Montone, Maurizio']",2023-09-06T10:08:52Z,EN,"['Retirement, conceptual framework, military, restructering, behavioral finance, financial decision-making, retirement savings, priming interventions']",Financial Management,"Retirement is one of the most significant problems facing the military currently, considering the impact of inflation on the defense budget and the externally applied pressure through the population regarding the national debt. The accelerating pace of population aging and the difficulty that service members encounter in retirement reinforce the present concerns about the prevalent poverty among veterans. Although several studies on retirement have been conducted, the emergence of behavioral finance and the incorporation of psychological principles in managing finances and saving practices have made the issue more prominent.
The study looks at the interactions between psychological and cognitive factors that affect service members’ retirement savings behavior. This research investigates the possibility of adapting the Department of Defense’s current retirement plan with an alternative military retirement framework. The new structure would encourage contributors to the retirement fund to transition from a more rigid and long-term oriented contribution system to a more individualistic-orientated pension plan. The findings and consequent modifications aim to improve the effectiveness of the retirement system and utilize the priming effect towards delivering a refined framework for service members while simultaneously improving retirement savings.
After conducting a thorough literature review, testable hypotheses are obtained to test the impact of the proposed independent variables. The findings indicate that the favorable effect stems from the positive correlation between the dependent variable retirement savings and the independent variables risk tolerance, parental influence, retirement goal clarity, and propensity to plan. Moreover, priming has a substantially moderating role in influencing both propensity to plan and retirement savings behavior. Consequently, a conceptual framework to adapt the current military retirement system is proposed and discussed."
Enablers of justice in the nature-based real estate sector in The Netherlands,"['Perera, Chayanika']","['Toxopeus, Helen']",2023-09-06T10:08:53Z,EN,['nature-based-solutions; NBS; justice; real estate justice; The Netherlands'],Business and Social Impact,"Nature-based-solutions (NBS) have been proposed as a promising pathway to building resilient, sustainable, and climate-adaptive cities. However, the recent academic scholarship is increasingly becoming aware that the impacts of NBS are not uniformly positive. This is because NBS tends to be costly, require high maintenance, more importantly can result in green gentrification and extend to a wider justice discussion spanning a diverse range of justices, including distributional, procedural, recognition and ecological justice. Therefore, there is a growing need to gain a deeper understanding of the wider justice interaction within the NBS paradigm, and re-orient the NBS implementation to include these justice aspects going forward.

Motivated by the recent emergence of real estate projects that successfully contribute to creating justice and remedying past inequalities, this research pioneers exploration into the intersection of real estate justice in NBS implementation. Through 11 semi-structured interviews from a carefully curated, diverse range of NBS practitioners and field notes from Urban NBS Day 2023 event organized by Utrecht University and Eindhoven University of Technology, this research aims to answer what enables justice in the nature-based real estate sector in The Netherlands.

The results show that receiving government support, harnessing knowledge, robust engagement, conducive organizational management, and partnerships help enable justice in the real estate sector in The Netherlands. This study offers three main contributions to the current academic discussion. First, it provides an overview of the debate on negative impacts of NBS in real estate. Second, it explores the wider justice implications of NBS in the real estate sector. Third, it unveils the factors that enable justice in the nature-based real estate projects. Through evidence, it shows that specific enablers can mitigate or rectify injustices arising from the conventional implementation of NBS in real estate."

Hence, this paper aims to answer the following research questions: How does ESG pillar scores affect firm performance? How does R&D investment affect firm performance and how does it impact the relationship between environmental pillar score and firm performance? How do board size and female on board serve as moderators for the relationship between environmental pillar scores on company performance in European firms? In order to answer these questions, this paper analyzes a sample collected from the Thomson–Eikon database from 2013 until 2019. The sample included 673 public and private firms in Europe region. The finding of this study shows that the social pillar score positively influences a firm's profitability and market value. However, it reveals a negative impact of the governance score on firm performance and of the environmental score on market value. Regarding R&D investment, the study suggests a negative impact on European firms' performance, although it does not significantly moderate the relationship between environmental performance and firm performance. Additionally, the study highlights a negative moderating effect of board size on the relationship between environmental performance and firm profitability. However, the presence of female representation on the board contributes positively to this relationship between environmental score and firm's market value."

Impact of Entrepreneurial Experience among Private Equity Lead Partner Teams on Buyout Performance,"['Severt, Anika']","['Hammer, Benjamin']",2023-09-06T10:08:58Z,EN,['Private Equity; Buyout Performance; Human Capital; Entrepreneurial Experience'],Banking and Finance,"This research paper empirically investigates the effect of entrepreneurial experience among Private Equity Lead Partner Teams on the operational performance of deals, measured by abnormal sales growth. The sample employed includes deal-level data on 262 leveraged buyouts between 1 st January 1997 and 31st December 2015 across 26 different countries. The findings suggest that entrepreneurial experience among Lead Partner Teams is associated with higher levels of operational performance. This validates the relevance of the relationship between entrepreneurial experience and performance, as previously established in Venture Capital and management literature, within the context of Private Equity. Further, insights into the contextual factors that may moderate this relationship are revealed. While the relationship is particularly strong among small and medium- sized enterprises and within the high-tech industry, target firms exhibiting little inorganic growth prior to the deal do not demonstrate a more pronounced relationship. This research contributes to the expanding body of literature on buyout performance and offers practical implications for aspiring professionals, educational facilities, family firms, and industry practitioners."
Investigating the Corruption and Economic Growth Debate in the Context of Institutional Regulatory Quality. New Evidence from South American Countries.,"['Rigotto, Natalia']","['Addo, Kwabena Aboah']",2023-09-06T10:08:49Z,EN,[],Financial Management,"This research paper empirically investigates the relationship between corruption and economic growth in South American countries, when introducing institutional regulatory quality in the relationship, as a moderator. With the use of a dynamic panel data model on a sample of 12 countries, within the period of 2012 to 2021, this paper finds that higher levels of perceived corruption tend to be prejudicial to economic growth, while better institutional regulatory quality positively impacts economic development. In addition, this paper adds a new level of insight to the “sand the wheels” perspective, providing new empirical evidence which shows that corruption is detrimental to economic growth, however, the negative impact is softened when regulatory quality is introduced as a moderator in the relationship, meaning that corruption is less detrimental to economic growth when a country presents higher levels of perceived regulatory quality, in terms of the government’s ability to formulate and implement regulations that promote private sector development. Policy implications of these findings are then developed."

This implies the potential of entrepreneurship in mitigating the rise of right-wing populism. Acknowledging inherent limitations in secondary data and focusing on the EU region's dynamics, the study offers insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners. It further suggests future research directions, emphasizing an exploration of how the entrepreneurial ecosystem influences populism through specific channels and mediating factors.

This multifaceted approach contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between entrepreneurship, populism, and socioeconomic dynamics."
Mental Model Complexity of Climate Change Causes and Consequences in Lake Victoria and Lagos: A Study on the Effects of Gender and Levels of Risk Perception,"['Hal, Charlotte van']","['Broek, Karlijn van den']",2023-09-12T00:01:22Z,EN,['mental models; mental model complexity differences; mental model complexity; climate change mental models; climate change mitigation; causes of climate change; consequences of climate change; psychological perception of climate change'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The purpose of this research was to gain insight into the mental model (MM) complexity of climate change causes and consequences. Two African regions, Lake Victoria and Lagos, which are severely impacted by climate change, were selected to assess the complexity of MM. Differences in MM complexity have been discerned by quantitively comparing the MM of climate change perceptions elicited through the M-Tool application, allowing to compare MM complexity between groups. 
The first research question investigated whether MM of climate change consequences consists of more concepts than MM of climate change causes. It was found that people tend to have a more comprehensive understanding of the potential consequences of climate change compared to the causes. When people in Lake Victoria and Lagos lack understanding of the multiple scientifically accurate causes of climate change, those impacted by climate change may not be able to recognize stakeholders beyond themselves or their region who contribute to climate change. As a result, they may be unable to hold these stakeholders accountable or confront them with their responsibilities to mitigate climate change. 
The second question addressed whether gender explains differences in MM complexity. No consistent gender differences in MM complexity of climate change causes and consequences were found, except for the amount of included concepts of MM of climate change causes in Lake Victoria. The results suggest that efforts to improve the amount of concepts in MM of climate change causes in Lake Victoria should take into account gender differences. However, the inclusion of more concepts by men in Lake Victoria does not necessarily indicate that men have more knowledge of the causes of climate change than women. This is because people with a higher level of system-thinking capabilities may have the ability to simplify complex relationships. Thus, it is not guaranteed that the MM will become more complex when increasing female knowledge of the causes of climate change in Lake Victoria. To recommend appropriate interventions, further research shall identify whether women in Lake Victoria have a less complex MM of climate change causes due to knowledge limitations or whether system-thinking capabilities led them to focus on the most important concepts causing climate change. 
The third question investigated whether risk perception levels explain differences in MM complexity. The results indicated a positive relationship between a greater perceived risk in Lagos, resulting in a higher amount of included concepts at the MM of the causes and consequences of climate change, and in Lake Victoria, a higher amount of included concepts at MM of the consequences of climate change. Those findings indicate that communication strategies can focus on increasing people's perception of climate change risk to enlarge the amount of included concepts. Enlarging the amount of included concepts in a person’s MM is recommended to gain a broader understanding of climate change concepts. A system thinking approach can benefit people in making better-informed decisions about climate change because they are better aware of the interconnectedness of multiple causes and consequences of climate change. It should be emphasized that although it is important for people to understand several causes and consequences of climate change, too much complexity can danger a feeling of disempowerment, giving people a sense that they cannot take action to deal with all causes of climate change. Also, the results may indicate that people with a higher perception of risk may have a greater level of awareness to identify different climate change concepts. However, they may not understand how these concepts are interconnected, which may indicate a lack of integrated research."
Harnessing Agroecological Business Model Potential - The Case Study of ASPROCIG - Colombia,"['Gongora Torres, Mateo']","['Mancini Teixeira, Heitor']",2023-09-12T00:01:25Z,EN,"['Agroecology, Inclusive Business Models, Sustainability Transitions, Pluralistic Values']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"In the face of numerous socio-ecological challenges confronting our current food systems, businesses have increasingly adopted sustainable practices based on western perspectives, often employing triple bottom line strategies. However, limited research exists on how rural communities develop their own business models based on their own knowledge systems. This study addresses this gap by investigating agroecological business models grounded in local epistemologies. The research centers on ASPROCIG, an organization situated in the Cienega Grande del Bajo Sinú region of Colombia.

The research objective is to understand the key features of agroecological business models that contribute to sustainability transitions. As research design a qualitative inductive approach coupled with participatory action research was employed. The research process involved three main steps. Firstly, the community's perception and understanding of value were explored to analyze how these concepts translated into the business model. Secondly, a critical reflection on the model was undertaken, along with discussions encompassing theories of agroecology, solidarity economy, economy of care, and sustainable business models. Lastly, an overarching strategy was formulated to guide and enhance the business.

The findings showcase that the underlying features of ASPROCIG's business model are deeply rooted in a collective knowledge system known as vivir sabroso (well-being), founded on pluralistic values and principles of solidarity and care that extend beyond mere financial gains. This model represents a food network ensuring Food Sovereignty for its stakeholders while fostering a platform for political engagement and co-creation. Following a SWOT analysis, identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, a systemic strategy was developed, incorporating objectives in ten critical areas that are fundamental to enhancing sustainability transitions. A main outcome is a nuance conceptualization of an Agroecological Business Model canvas that serves as tool to analyze business models thoroughly.

This research highlights the implications for agroecology and sustainable business model literature, underscoring its significance as an opportunity to reconceptualize prevailing paradigms regarding value, business, and development. Through the incorporation of pluralistic values grounded in a biocentric perspectives, embracing emancipatory agroecology, shaping to solidarity-based and care-oriented economies, and employing strategic approaches, Agroecological Business Models present a feasible path for communities to effectively tackle contemporary socio-ecological challenges and attain food sovereignty."
Examining Alcohol Consumption as a Risk Factor and Sexual Interaction Competence as a Protective Factor against Sexual Victimization amongst Young Adults in the Netherlands,"['Roy Chowdhury, Diya']","['Ditzhuijzen, J.M. van']",2023-09-12T00:01:31Z,EN,[],"Social Challenges, Policies and Interventions","This present study aims to examine if sexual interaction competence could be an effective moderator on the relationship between alcohol consumption (consumed at a party or night out) and sexual victimization (whilst intoxicated). This study is focusing on the Dutch population and more specifically on those aged 16-25. The study has a cross-sectional design, participants (n=1340) completed self- report questionnaires which assessed these three variables. To understand the relationships between our variables, logistic regression models were conducted. From the results, the study was able to yield three predictor variables of SV for female participants: alcohol consumption, sexual interaction competence and gender. However, it was not able to yield any statistical results on sexual interaction competence’s moderation effect on alcohol consumption and sexual victimization. Therefore, with these results it conveys that interaction competence may not be the most appropriate moderator on this relationship and future research needs to continue to consider other factors so that we are eventually able to find an appropriate moderator for this relationship."
"Water and Ground Governance on Multiple Levels: an ex-ante 
assessment of the Netherlands’s new ‘Water and Ground 
Steering’ policy framework","['Molen, Pieter van der']","['Hegger, Dries']",2023-09-12T00:01:16Z,EN,['Multi-Level Governance; Effectiveness; Policy Framework; Water management; Land Management'],Sustainable Development,"Amid the increasing severity of floods and dwindling land availability, the 
management and governance of water and ground have moved up the social and political 
agendas. The importance of adequate cooperation and coordination between different 
governance levels, both vertical and horizontal (i.e., multi-level governance or MLG) that are 
concerned with water and ground management is increasingly being recognised. The 
Netherlands has a long history with, mainly water-related, MLG policies of which the ‘Water 
en Bodem sturend’ (Water and Ground steering or WBS) policy framework is the latest. 
WBS aims to steer spatial planning policymaking to accommodate the limits of the water and 
ground systems in the Netherlands. This research revolves around an ex-ante assessment of 
the WBS policy framework and thereby also attempts to bridge the knowledge gap 
concerning evaluating the effectiveness of MLG policies. The corresponding research 
question reads: “What governance strategies are able to enhance the effectiveness of a MLG 
policy, and to what extent?” The research question consists of two parts. Firstly, it seeks to 
determine how the effectiveness of MLG policies can be assessed. Secondly, it attempts to 
distinguish the governance strategies that can enhance the measured policy effectiveness. 

Based on scholarly literature, a novel analytical framework was developed that can 
assess the effectiveness of MLG policies. An embedded case study analysis was adopted, in 
which the overarching MLG structure of the Netherlands was the context and the unit of 
analysis was the WBS policy framework. Furthermore, three sub-units were selected, namely 
the provinces Noord-Holland, Utrecht and Overijssel. Subsequently, WBS-related documents 
were gathered and 15 interviews were conducted with policy advisors from the provinces or 
individuals who have knowledge of the policy framework. The documents and interviews 
were qualitatively coded and analysed using the developed analytical framework.

The research found that WBS scored worst on the ‘are the short-term and long-term 
effects of policies accounted for?’ and ‘are the different problem frames comprised into a 
common perspective?’. Hence, the employed governance strategies focused mainly on the 
mentioned indicators, as this could yield the most improvements to the effectiveness of WBS. 
A combination of connectivity and temporal strategies were used to address the shortcomings 
of WBS regarding said indicators. This study demonstrated that the effectiveness of a MLG 
policy (framework) can be assessed and highlighted the potential of employing governance
strategies to enhance the effectiveness"
The impact of paludiculture on farmers' livelihoods,"['Klooster, Celine']","['Otsuki, Kei']",2023-09-12T00:01:19Z,EN,['Paludiculture; peatlands; nature-based solutions; sustainable agriculture; food security.'],Sustainable Development,"All around the world peatlands are degrading which has worse effects on the climate, biodiversity, and farmers due to forest fires and weather extremes. Therefore, restoration practices are needed to restore these peatlands. One restoration method is paludiculture which is the ‘sustainable production of biomass on wet and rewetted peatlands' (Wichtmann and Joosten, 2007, p. 12). However, this means these farmers need to switch to a completely different way of farming which may impact livelihoods, including social and economic consequences. Therefore, it is important to examine the impact of paludiculture on farmers’ livelihoods.

This research addresses the question: What is the impact of paludiculture on farmers’ livelihoods? This question is answered through the lens of two case studies in Indonesia and Sweden. First, both the Peatland Restoration Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy were examined to examine how paludiculture is represented in the agricultural policies of Indonesia and Sweden. Then, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with farmers and experts in Indonesia and Sweden. For Indonesia, farmers were interviewed from Tanjung Putri in Central Kalimantan, where they are currently conducting a paludiculture project in collaboration with BRGM. For Sweden, farmers who were not conducting paludiculture were interviewed from North and Central Sweden. 

Findings show that paludiculture has several positive impacts such as improved food security, the presence of fishing, a decrease in floods and forest fires, an increase in education, and possibilities for cattle and hunting. Negative impacts include no inclusivity of other farmers in paludiculture, economic inequality, more dependency, and more rules. These impacts have different effects on different groups of farmers. For instance, the men of households with high economic status have more opportunities in terms of livelihoods and paludiculture. Young female farmers often do not own land, and it is hard to switch to paludiculture due to income restrictions. Small-scale farmers with low-income face similar issues. Age and education also play a role here, since paludiculture is a completely new way of agriculture which means that knowledge should be gained to conduct paludiculture, which is difficult for older farmers with low education.
This research examined several positive and negative impacts paludiculture has on livelihoods. Paludiculture can be a method that can save both peatlands and livelihoods, but when implemented, it is important to remember the impact this method has on livelihoods."
Meaning-making processes in successful commercial games: A Dark Souls and Disco Elysium case study,"['Rijnders, Frans']","['Vervoort, Joost']",2023-09-12T00:01:21Z,EN,['Commercial games; meaning-making; qualitative'],Sustainable Development,"Games have developed the last decade into a strong and versatile medium with a strong potential and opportunities for societal change. Serious games have attempted to varying success to use the medium to create educational gain in their players, however, these games tend to create superficial experiences that don’t seem to retain the attention of the player. Commercial video games on the other hand focus on these deeper emotional experiences, but to what extent these experiences lead to meaningful implications towards the player’s real life, which are sought in serious games, is unexplored in literature. This research set out to explore these potential meaningful implications in the successful commercial games Dark Souls and Disco Elysium, using meaning making theory. Various meaningful themes have been found in both games, varying from empowerment and perseverance to diving into and understanding one’s own thoughts. These themes revolved around immersion and resonance with the real world, which led to a strong emotional involvement and thereby the lessons learned in the game were more easily translated towards the player’s real life. This research is a starting point of exploring how meaningful experiences can be created within games to eventually be able to implement specific meanings the developer wishes to get across. The immersion and resonance with the real world seemed crucial for the meaningful experiences here, but this is still largely unexplored in literature and needs to be further investigated in different games and genres. Still, the strong meaning making processes that were seen highlight the relevance of the deeper emotional experiences in game development, when these meaningful applications are sought."

More specifically, it examined whether shame and guilt are significantly associated with event centrality and PTSD symptoms and whether event centrality mediates the relationship between shame, guilt and PTSD symptoms. Event centrality is defined as the degree to which an event is seen as self-defining, how often one considers and thinks back to it, and also the degree to which it influences their interpretations of past and current experiences. The sample of this study consisted of 336 people with a mean age of 22.3 years. Participants responded to an online survey containing an emotional memory recall task, an event centrality questionnaire and a PTSD symptom questionnaire. The findings indicated a significant positive association between shame and guilt, and that event centrality fully mediated the association between shame and guilt and PTSD symptoms. Conclusions were: negative moral emotions may play a significant role as a mechanism behind PTSD symptoms following experience of PMIEs, although further research is encouraged to clarify this relationship. Subjective peritraumatic experiences should not be underestimated when attempting to predict PTSD symptoms following a PMIE."
The effect of observing affective touch on anxiety levels,"['Pagliuca, Anna']","['Hasenack, B']",2023-09-12T00:01:26Z,EN,['affective touch; anxiety; observing affective touch'],Clinical Psychology,"Affective touch has been proven to have a buffering effect against anxiety, which led to the design of new therapeutic methods based on affective touch. Newer research suggested that observing affective touch may have similarities to the actual perception of touch. This proposes that the beneficial effects of actual social touch may be provided by observation of affective touch as well. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of observing affective touch on anxiety levels. The hypothesis was that observing affective touch would result in a stronger decrease in state anxiety, compared to observing non-affective touch. The final sampled was composed of 76 participants, of which 32 in the observing affective touch condition, and 44 in the observing non-affective touch condition. Anxiety levels were measured at baseline, after an anxiety-provoking task, and after the touch videos. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in anxiety reduction between the two conditions. However, both groups experienced a significant decrease in anxiety after watching the touch videos. These results could be due to limitations in the design of the study. Furthermore, a deeper examination of neurological studies also suggests that the findings may be the result of differing neurological pathways activated by actual touch and observing touch.  Additional research on the topic is necessary, as such research could pave the way for developing innovative methods to regulate anxiety levels through the observation of affective touch, potentially benefiting a wide range of individuals."
Trouble at the Border: Reframing the Paleobiogeographical Debate over Wegener’s Theory of Continental Drift as a Problem of Paleontology’s Greater Integration with Evolutionary Biology,"['Joseph, Shannon']","['Nieves-Delgado, A']",2023-09-27T23:01:06Z,EN,"['paleontology; evolutionary biology; integration; geology; 20th century; Wegener; modern synthesis, continental drift']",History and Philosophy of Science,"Why did George Gaylord Simpson (1902-1984), probably the most consequential paleontologist of his generation, at first reject the theory of continental drift when, according to Alfred Wegener (1880-1930) who first proposed the theory in 1915, some of the most compelling evidence for drift was paleontological?  

In The Rejection of Continental Drift (1999), Naomi Oreskes argued that the comparative geological methods of the paleontologists and stratigraphers were “old” forms of evidence, already mired in long standing theoretical debates and subject to “a priori assumptions” about its inability to decisively rule between competing theories.  

This thesis will argue that a more complete answer for Simpson and other paleontologists’ rejection of Wegener’s theory can be found by reframing the debate as a problem of disciplinary integration. In philosophy of science, integration refers to the coming together of different scientific fields for interdisciplinary research. Paleontology, I suggest, should be reframed as a ‘border science.’ I adopt this term to describe the unique positioning of paleontological work at the border between two disciplines: biology and geology. Redefining paleontology as a scientific discipline in terms of its boundary status highlights the competing demands that have historically been placed on paleontological evidence by the ‘parent’ disciplines. 

This thesis will argue that the best answer to the question of why paleontologists failed to reach a favorable consensus on continental drift necessitates a critical evaluation of the differing epistemic standards in biology and geology that informed early twentieth century paleontological work. I suggest the following: paleontologists involved in the drift debate were divided over how best to integrate evolutionary theory into paleontological practice and that this was the major source of their confusion. 

I compare paleobotanists’ analysis of the distribution of Glossopteris, a Permian-aged genus of seed plants, with vertebrate paleontologists’ analysis of the distribution of the large land fauna of the southern hemisphere. I show how the two groups’ differing approaches to climate, temporality, and how to assess the similarity of lifeforms, were a product of their closer ties to either geology or biology, respectively, and that this positioning greatly influenced their analysis. I conclude that, as a ‘border science,’ integrative efforts to bring paleontology more in line with the rest of evolutionary science also meant an initial loss of epistemic authority for paleontology’s more traditional evidentiary role within geological research. For the history of paleontology, my research suggests that the traditional demarcation of biologically focused work in paleontology as ‘paleobiology’ obscures the broader consequences that a greater integration with evolutionary biology has had on paleontology as an entire discipline. My perspective also adds to the growing literature on the philosophy of integration by suggesting that fields peripheral to those fields being integrated (i.e. geology, for this thesis), whether through pre-existing epistemic commitments or institutional structures, are integral in directing the course of the integration process."
Complexiteit aan het licht: Kwalitatief onderzoek naar de betekenisgeving van U-TECH community aan de publiek-private samenwerking,"['Grond, Renée']","['Waardenburg, Maikel']",2023-09-27T23:00:53Z,NL,['Publiek-private samenwerking; hybriditeit; sensemaking; logics; organisatiestructuur; organisatiecultuur'],"Organization, Change and Management","Eén van de meest urgente maatschappelijke kwesties van deze tijd is het toenemend 
personeelstekort, dat onder andere in de ICT-sector duidelijk merkbaar is (CA-ICT, 2021). Dergelijke 
problematiek vereist een gezamenlijke aanpak van organisaties uit zowel de publieke als private 
sector, waarin verschillende oplossingsrichtingen geïntegreerd worden. Steeds vaker wordt dit 
georganiseerd middels publiek-private samenwerking (PPS). Dit is een complexe organisatievorm 
waarin partijen uit de ‘triple helix’ – onderwijs, overheid en bedrijfsleven – samenwerken aan een 
maatschappelijke kwestie (Talen, 2022). U-TECH community is zo een PPS die zich richt op het 
aanpakken van de krapte en mismatch op de ICT-arbeidsmarkt. De complexiteit van een PPS wordt 
veroorzaakt door de verschillende belangen van publieke en private actoren die samenkomen, wat 
spanning kan opleveren. Een organisatie waarin verschillende belangen en werkwijzen verenigd 
worden, wordt ook wel een hybride organisatie genoemd (Quélin, Kivleniece & Lazzarini, 2017). Om 
samenwerking zo effectief mogelijk te laten verlopen, is het creëren van inzicht in hoe actoren in een 
PPS kijken naar de samenwerking van belang. 
Het doel van dit onderzoek is het analyseren van de verwachtingen die partners en medewerkers van 
U-TECH community hebben van hun onderlinge samenwerking en inzicht creëren in de betekenissen 
die zij geven aan deze samenwerking. De onderzoeksvraag luidt dan ook: Welke betekenis geven 
(project)partners en medewerkers van U-TECH community aan de samenwerking binnen hun publiekprivate samenwerkingsstructuur?
U-TECH community is een PPS waarbij een losstaande organisatie de coördinatie van de 
samenwerking op zich neemt. Deze organisatie bestaat uit een kernteam van vijf medewerkers. 
Daarnaast sluiten overheden, onderwijsinstanties en bedrijven aan als (project)partner. De 
onderzoeksvraag is beantwoord door middel van een kwalitatief onderzoek, waarin zowel 
medewerkers als (project)partners zijn geïnterviewd. De interviews zijn aangevuld met data uit 
documenten en observaties. 
Uit een grondige analyse van de data blijkt dat de samenwerking gekenmerkt wordt door een hoge 
mate van complexiteit. Deze complexiteit wordt veroorzaakt door de hybriditeit die op verschillende 
niveaus in de organisatie terugkomt. U-TECH community als organisatie, oftewel het kernteam, kent 
hybriditeit in dat het een maatschappelijke missie nastreeft, maar ook op een commerciële wijze 
partners moet aantrekken. Daarnaast bestaat hybriditeit tussen de partners uit de triple helix, 
vanwege cultuur- en structuurverschillen die soms tegenstrijdig lijken. Tot slot zijn enkele partners op 
zichzelf ook hybride organisaties. 
Om deze gelaagde hybriditeit te managen, schakelen medewerkers tussen de verschillende publieke 
en private perspectieven en spiegelen deze aan hun partners om wederzijds begrip te creëren. 
Daarnaast is er bewust ruimte gecreëerd voor ambiguïteit binnen de organisatiestructuur, middels 
informele afspraken en een vrije invulling van de samenwerking, om recht te doen aan deze 
complexe hybriditeit. Het gevolg hiervan is echter dat betrokken partijen, zowel medewerkers als 
partners, eigen betekenissen toekennen aan de samenwerking om met deze ambiguïteit om te gaan. 
Dit levert aanzienlijke onduidelijkheid op omtrent o.a. het doel van de samenwerking, de concrete 
acties die uitgevoerd gaan worden en de overlegstructuren. Het optimaliseren van de samenwerking 
vereist dan ook een betere afstemming van verwachtingen onderling. Ondanks deze uitdagingen 
ervaren betrokkenen een positieve connotatie bij de samenwerking, voornamelijk vanwege de 
persoonlijke vertrouwensrelaties tussen individuen die de samenwerking uitvoeren."
Ready or Not: Assessing Social Capital for Urban Resilience in the US,"['Fujikawa, Amelia']","['Laerhoven, Frank van']",2023-09-27T23:01:02Z,EN,['Urban Resilience; community resilience; resilience planning; urban governance; social capital; SDG 11'],Sustainable Development,"Urban areas in the United States are acutely at risk of an array of natural disasters that will become more frequent as climate change intensifies. Urban resilience is a multi-faceted concept that cities have adopted to prepare and respond to disasters, allowing them to quickly ‘bounce back’ from the shocks and adaptively innovate to prevent future disruptions. Social capital is a concept that focuses on the intangible value of strong, connected, and trustworthy networks that when activated, accelerates a community’s response and recovery to disruptive events.

This research seeks to enhance the understanding of social capital and urban resilience in the US context by examining small-medium-sized cities and illuminating how they recognize and operationalize their concepts. To do this, a comprehensive literature review was first conducted to explore the theory of social capital and urban resilience. This led to the development of an analytical framework that was applied to four US cities by conducting semi-structured interviews. The findings from the case studies revealed that cities typically do recognize and operationalize the concepts of social capital. However, they also encountered challenges related to augmenting social capital, primarily due to conceptual overlaps and contextual factors. Based on these insights, an assessment tool was drafted integrating empirical findings from the case study analysis with theoretical underpinnings through empirical confrontation."

However, recent advancements show that the naïve T cell pool is much more heterogeneous and compartmentalized than thought before. This compartmentalization suggests selective homing of naïve T cells to specific tissues in the body, through the expression of homing markers. Homing of naïve T cells is thought to take place especially early in life. Until this day, the drivers of early-life homing and homing marker expression of naïve T cells are not yet fully understood. In this report, we investigate the immunological context of early life naïve T cell homing. For this purpose, we studied naïve T cell homing throughout early life immune development as well as in response to immunological triggers. First, we analyzed flow cytometry data of the immune system of preterm infants in the first 42 days postpartum. We show that preterm neonates have a high percentage of naïve T cells and that these T cells predominantly express gut homing markers integrin α4β7 and CCR9. Interestingly, the neonatal naïve T cell phenotype does not consistently change within the first 42 days postpartum. Second, we looked at the effect of Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) ligand exposure in different stimulatory settings. TCR and TLR co-stimulation seems to enhance naïve T cell proliferation, along with upregulation of homing markers. Altogether, we conclude that neonatal naive T cells indeed express homing markers and that this is influenced by immune development as well as TCR and TLR stimulation."

"The effect of increasing vegetation cover on heat stress in urban areas affected by global warming: A case study of Rotterdam, the Netherlands","['Leijnse, Emilia']","['Karssenberg, Derek']",2023-05-18T00:00:47Z,EN,['heat stress; heat mitigation; physiological equivalent temperature; PET; urban planning strategies; urban vegetation; Tygron Geodesign Platform'],Earth Surface and Water,"This study assesses how current and future urban heat stress in the Netherlands can possibly be reduced by increasing the vegetation cover. Climate change is expected to increase the global atmospheric temperature, causing the probability of being exposed to heat stress to increase (McCarthy et al., 2010). In urban areas, factors such as the urban heat island (UHI) cause unfavourable conditions for the energy balance of the human body, which leads to the occurrence of heat stress (Oleson et al., 2015). Increasing the vegetation cover is believed to reduce heat stress in the public outdoor space (Lindberg et al., 2016). The aim of this study is to quantify the effect of vegetation on heat stress in urban areas of the Netherlands, in the current and future climate. By doing this, knowledge is gained of how climate change will influence heat stress in urban regions of the Netherlands, and how heat stress can be reduced by increasing the vegetation. The study aims to assess how increasing the vegetation cover affects heat stress in urban areas, by analysing various factors that influence heat stress and the effect vegetation has on these factors. Furthermore, an empirical regression model is used to calculate the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, under current and future climatic conditions. Multiple numerical simulations are carried out for different tree-scenarios involving varying numbers of trees in the study area to determine the heat stress in Rotterdam. The results of the literature study show that vegetation can considerably reduce heat stress by affecting shade and evapotranspiration rates, but its impact on wind can also slightly increase heat stress. Earlier research states that the type and arrangement of vegetation in an area have a strong impact on how effectively vegetation can lessen heat stress (Dimoudi & Nikolopoulou, 2003). The results of the model runs reveal that Rotterdam currently experiences strong to extreme heat stress on summer days with a moderately high probability of occurrence. In addition, heat stress is expected to worsen and become more widespread over time. By 2050, on summer days that occur every 3 years, extreme heat stress is expected in the majority of Rotterdam. In 2085, extreme levels of heat stress can be found over the entire study area. In both the current and future climate, the potential heat stress is not equal throughout the study area, as heat stress is more severe in densely built-up areas in the city centre compared to the surrounding suburbs. On average, the level of heat stress increases when an individual leaves a building. Trees have the potential to decrease the potential exposure of citizens to severe levels of physiological stress during warm summer days. However, increasing the number of trees with 50 percent of the original number of trees will not be enough to lower the average level of heat stress in Rotterdam from ‘extreme’ to ‘strong’ or ‘moderate’ heat stress. Increasing the vegetation cover can be used as a measure to mitigate heat stress in urban areas in the Netherlands, however reducing the inevitable future heat stress caused by climate change will require more than this single mitigation strategy."
"Geochemical analysis of the WINT-UU-21 core to study volcanism during the Late Triassic (Rhaetian) at
Winterswijk","['Everwijn, Teun']","['Schootbrugge, Bas van der']",2023-05-16T01:01:16Z,EN,[],"Earth, Life and Climate","The WINT-UU-21 core taken at Winterswijk is studied for evidence of environmental change,
specifically volcanism, during the late Triassic and the emplacement of the Central Atlantic
Magmatic Province (CAMP). The Late Triassic (Rhaetian) part of the core consists of black
shale from 23.985 to 20.2 mbs and red and grey clay (mainly red) until 13.55 mbs. Magnetic
susceptibility and carbon isotope data combined with Hg, palaeoproductivity proxies,
climatic proxies, and redox proxies are used to determine and compare changes during this
time interval with other studies. There is a clear negative Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE)
visible in the δ13C data, which matches with the Marshi CIE in other studies. Together with
Hg data there is a clear indication that there is indeed volcanism taking place during the
sedimentation of the core. The volcanism would have taken place in the lowest part of the
Rhaetian that is preserved in the core. The Marshi CIE is used to correlate the Winterswijk
core to two sites in northern Germany, which also show the extinction interval known as the
Triletes Beds above the Marshi CIE. The lithological transition from shale to clay in the core
corresponds to the changes from the Contorta Beds (pre-extinction interval) to the Triletes
Beds (extinction interval). As there are other Hg spikes in the core without changes in δ13C it
is clear that there is another source of Hg besides volcanism or at least that high Hg
concentrations do not mean that there is volcanism taking place. Clear cyclicity likely caused
by precession is clearly visible in the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and climatic proxies used
in this study, and slightly less in the magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic susceptibility is not
indicative of terrestrial input, as high peaks in the magnetic susceptibility are not
accompanied by increases in terrestrial trace elements Fe, Ti and Al. To study
palaeoproductivity the enrichment factor of Ba and P are analysed. Both elements are under-
enriched compared to the reference shale, but these two elements are not in agreement with
each other about the changes in palaeoproductivity through time. This might be due to an
outside source of P to the system, as the enrichment factor of P in the extinction interval is
not lower than before the extinction interval and anoxia does not seem to play a role in Ba
and P recycling. Anoxia is higher in the Contorta Beds than the Triletes Beds, but does not
seem to correlate to other changes throughout the core, aside from lower anoxia in the
Triletes Beds during drier conditions."
De publieke waarde van commercieel sportaanbod,"['Boelders, Jasper']","['Roest, Jan-Willem van der']",2023-05-18T00:00:54Z,NL,"['publieke waarde, commercieel sportaanbod']",Sportbeleid en sportmanagement,"Het sportaanbod en de overheid kennen in Nederland veel interactie en afhankelijkheden. De commerciële sport is hierop geen uitzondering, maar wordt weinig benoemd in gemeentelijk sportbeleid. Dit, terwijl het aannemelijk is dat ook commercieel sportaanbod een bijdrage levert aan publieke doelstellingen, denk hierbij aan het verbeteren van de volksgezondheid en sociale cohesie. Het onderzoek richt zich op de vraag of dit sportaanbod van publieke waarde wordt gezien door sportbeleidsambtenaren en de aanbieders zelf. Aanvullend wordt er gekeken hoe deze twee perspectieven gezamenlijk via commercieel sportaanbod publieke waarde kunnen creëren. Om dit te onderzoeken is er een kwalitatieve onderzoeksbenadering gekozen. Aan de hand van, in totaal 12, interviews met sportbeleidsambtenaren en commerciële sportaanbieders is er gevraagd naar de betekenis die zij geven aan de publieke waarde van commercieel sportaanbod. Het onderzoek gebruikt de theorie van Bryson et al. als kader om te kijken naar publieke waarde-creatie zonder of samen met de publieke sector (2015a). Hieruit komt naar voren dat zowel de sportbeleidsambtenaren als de commerciële sportaanbieders zien dat het aanbod zorgt voor publieke waarde (PW). Hierbij komen vanuit beiden punten naar voren die gaan over het verbeteren van de volksgezondheid, het voldoen aan de vraag naar sportaanbod en het bieden van een uitlaatklep. De sportaanbieders benadrukken aanvullend ook het verbinden van mensen als belangrijke impact. Toch beschrijven beide partijen ook dat het zijn van een commerciële organisatie beperkingen met zich meebrengt die volgens de sportaanbieders niet altijd nodig zijn. De commerciële insteek zou ervoor zorgen dat samenwerkingen, regelingen en legitimiteit voor het creëren van publieke waarde worden beperkt. Wel zeggen alle sportaanbieders open te staan voor het creëren van meer publieke impact in samenwerking met de gemeente. Dit soort samenwerkingen bestaan ook al en hier wordt al gewerkt aan het creëren van PW. Verder komt De PW voort uit de waardering van het aanbod en de menselijke behoefte om te kunnen bewegen. Aanvullend doordat individuele, uit eigenbelang gemotiveerde, sport afnamen en er in de optelsom PW ontstaat, voornamelijk meer volksgezondheid. Het onderzoek is hiermee van belang omdat het inzicht geeft in de verschillende rollen en de publieke waarde van de commerciële sport. Zo kan de gemeente meer legitimiteit verschaffen aan commerciële sportaanbieders om publieke waarde toe te voegen en willen de aanbieders graag mee denken over de waarde die gecreëerd kan worden door middel van de commerciële sport. Hier uitvoering aan geven kan door middel van het opzetten van netwerken en door de aanbieders vroegtijdig te betrekken bij het bepalen van de gewenste te creëren publieke waarde met de daarbij horende commercie."

Multiple tools exist to cross-correlate a reference library to spectra obtained via mass spectrometry. Using raw data from a synthetic peptide library containing normal and phospho peptides as a benchmark, we could compare the annotated MS/MS spectra between multiple search engines (MaxQuant, MSFragger, SEQUEST, Mascot, and Comet). Data analysis revealed that assessing the quantity of annotated PSMs is not an accurate representation of the quality of search engines, for example, actual false discovery rate (FDR) is much higher than selected in search engine setup. Or because some search engines annotates additional PSMs for already annotated peptide feature, leading to a three-fold decrease in unique peptides. Comparison of the overlap of unique peptides between search engines revealed that only 51.7% of normal peptides and 41.8% of phospho peptides are shared between three or more search engines. Additionally we did calculate phospho posttranslational modification (PTM) localization score using the same algorithm for all search engines to assess the accuracy of assignment of the phospho PTM position. We did observe distinct pattern of increased number of false positives among the assigned locations for spectra with lower PTM localisation probabilities. The overall assessment of search engine comparison is that each annotates slightly different set of PSMs and that  to improve confidence in annotations we recommend to analyse your data with software tools."
Effects of reefs on fish communities in the southern North Sea,"['Dil, Mandy']","['Bouma, Tjeerd']",2023-05-16T01:01:14Z,EN,['Reefs; North Sea; Fish; BRUVS;'],Marine Sciences,"This research investigates the effects of reefs on fish communities in the southern North Sea and indicates whether there could be spillover of fish species of commercial interest. Knowledge on these effects is important to provide background information for projects on oyster reef restoration and can be used in the design of offshore wind farms, which is a relevant topic with various of such projects being executed. To answer the research questions, video footage was analysed from cameras on baited remote underwater video systems placed on sampling stations inside and outside the Voordelta shellfish reef and the Borkum stones area. For each station the number of different species and the maximum number of individuals per species present on the footage was noted. The stations inside the reef were then compared to the stations outside of the reef. In the Voordelta, the species richness and the total abundance was greater inside the reef than outside of the reef. In the Borkum area the species richness and abundance were slightly higher outside of the reef compared to inside of the reef, but not significantly. However, the results of the PERMANOVA of both areas demonstrate that there is a clear distinction between the stations located inside of the reef and outside of the reef. This study concludes that shellfish reefs, like the one in the Voordelta, enhance species richness and abundance, and provide nursery or foraging areas for juvenile horse mackerel and seabass, which are commercial species. In a rocky reef like the Borkum stones area the difference between inside and outside of the reef is less pronounced, but the rocky reef still provides a higher diversity in the entire area and attracts species such as cod and whiting."

Scheduling data feed processing jobs,"['Berg, Maarten van den']","['Liu, Alison']",2023-05-23T00:00:51Z,EN,[],Computing Science,"Online advertising is an important strategy for companies that sell products on the internet to find customers. These companies often make use of an e-commerce system, which stores data on the products that the company sells. If a company's inventory changes often, it may be desirable to automate the process of creating and updating advertisements, to reduce the workload of keeping advertisements up to date.

Channable is a company that provides a tool for automated creation of advertisements, based on the data in a company's e-commerce system. Channable offers a product feed processing system which connects to a company's e-commerce system and regularly downloads information on the company's inventory. Once this data has been downloaded the system can apply customer-defined processing rules to the data and convert the data to a format suitable for submission to one or more advertising platforms or marketplaces.

The heavy computational lifting in this system is performed by rule processing servers, which accept inventory data and customer-defined processing rules and produce a datastream that has been processed according to the customer-defined rules. Channable uses multiple of these rule processing servers for redundancy and performance reasons, and so it must balance the workload between the servers.

The current method for assigning work to the servers uses a distributed scheduler. This scheduler has some limitations which cause it to distribute the work unevenly between servers, causing some servers to regularly become overloaded while other servers sit idle.

In this thesis we implement a better method for assigning work to the rule processing servers, by making use of a centralised scheduler. We compare two methods for detecting overloaded servers and one alternative algorithm for assigning work to servers to the current approach by performing experiments using real-world data to determine which scheduling approach performs best.

We show that using our scheduler can significantly improve the performance of the rule processing system: our best-performing scheduling algorithm speeds up the average duration of low-priority jobs by a factor of 2.2 and reduces the average waiting time of low-priority jobs by a factor of 3.5. We are also able to significantly reduce the variance in waiting time between the different rule processing servers, making the product feed processing system's performance more predictable."

TripLan2vec: Leveraging Pre-Trained Language Models for Inductive Triple Embeddings,"['Kisjes, Adriaan']","['Chekol, Mel']",2023-05-23T00:00:47Z,EN,['Knowledge Graph; Natural Language Model; Triple Embedding'],Business Informatics,"Many organizations and data dependent applications deal with the fact that data is often incomplete and siloed across multiple knowledge bases. The semantic web and knowledge graphs are powerful tools that mitigate this by allowing rule-based systems to complete and connect different knowledge bases. To enable the use of more advanced machine-learning algorithms such as logistic regression or neural net- works, knowledge graphs need to be transformed into some kind of numeric input. In the field of neural language processing this has been solved with vector embed- dings, where for each word a vector is learned that captures its semantic meaning. There exist many knowledge graph embedding techniques inspired by natural lan- guage processing, one of which is Triple2vec where triples (two entities and the relation connecting them) are embedded as a whole. Triple2vec is innovative be- cause it captures both the graph topology as well as the heterogeneity of knowledge graphs, where other methods often focus on just one of those aspects. This thesis proposes to build on triple embeddings by developing TripLan2vec: a triple em- bedding technique that uses a pre-trained language model to generate embeddings based on textual descriptions. This enriches the embeddings by both capturing graph structure as well as natural language semantics. Moreover, it also enables the triple embeddings to be generated inductively with just a description as input, this means that triples that are not part of the training process can still be embedded, unlike with Triple2vec. During evaluation it was shown that TripLan2vec performs well at discriminating between true and false triples, and at predicting whether two triples are neighbours. In inductive evaluation, where just part of the training data was available, TripLan2vec outperforms most other methods."

based on a 3D scan of the hoof, printed in plastic materials, and then glued to the hooves. Six
horses underwent a 3D-printed shoeing cycle and a steel shoeing cycle of seven weeks in randomised
order. Kinetic parameters were collected in trot using pressure- and force plates at a frequency of 250 Hz
at week 1 (T0) and week 7 (T1). Hoof pictures were taken at T0 and T1 to determine the hoof
conformation and wear characterises of the shoes. Data were analysed using a linear mixed effect model
with shoeing conditions and timepoints as fixed effects and horse and limbs as random
effects. The results showed a significantly larger peak vertical force (PVF) and vertical impulse (VI) at
both timepoints in the 3D-printed shoes (T0: +0.9 N/kg; p value = .001 and +179.0 N.s/kg; p value
= .005, T1: +1.3 N/kg; p value < .001 and +294.7 N.s/kg; p value < .001). The peak pressure was more
evenly distributed between the regions of the hoof in the 3D-printed shoes at both timepoints. The hoof
conformation variables indicate a more balanced hoof growth (and/or wear) in the 3D-printed shoeing
cycle. The wear distribution of the 3D-printed shoes was more homogenous. The higher PVF and VI
values in the 3D-printed shoes suggest that horses exerted more force on the concerning limb. The
homogenous wear distribution in the 3D-printed shoes could be explained by the evenly distributed peak
pressure in tailormade 3D-printed shoes."

Results indicate that there was no difference between students’ challenge-threat responses to feedback coming from different feedback senders. Also, self-efficacy is not found to have a moderating effect on this relationship. However, positive relationships are found between the degree of self-efficacy and the presence of relative challenge when processing teacher and peer feedback. The correlations between mastery orientation and challenge-threat responses to teacher and peer feedback show no relationship. There is also no relationship found between the performance-approach orientation and challenge-threat responses to peer feedback. However, correlations indicate negative relationships between the performance-approach orientation and challenge-threat responses to teacher feedback and between the performance-avoidance orientation and challenge-threat responses to teacher and peer feedback.

OPTICAL ANALYSIS OF ION DYNAMICS IN A BATTERY,"['Nelfyenny, Nelfyenny']","['Faez, S.']",2023-05-22T00:00:45Z,EN,[],Experimental Physics,"RFBs have emerged as a promising electrochemical energy storage technology capable of
storing renewable energy sources with long charge-discharge cycle life. As a result, battery
monitoring systems have become highly significant, particularly in battery research,
to evaluate the performance of battery components or materials after many cycles of operation.
In this study, we explore the dynamics of the ions within the electrode when
the cell is linked to a potential since this parameter can provide information on the electrochemical
performance, indicating the reversibility of the ions during operation. The
dielectric characteristics of ions, which react to electric potentials, are utilized to track
ion movement within the cell using optical microscopy. This property is connected to the
polarizability of active particle valence/conduction electrons in electrodes. The cell will
be tested using three different electrolytes; NaCl, FeCl2 and FeCl3. The laser beam is
shone at electrochemically operating battery particles as they store or release ions, and
the scattered light is analysed. According to the experimental results, half-cells with three
different electrolyte solutions may flow ions from one electrode to another with currents
ranging from 6 μA to 0.5 mA. The modulation signal at 1 Hz is applied to the cell, and
the FFT technique is utilized to determine if the ion response can be monitored optically.
However, the response of ions to potential changes is unnoticeable visually. Because the
scatter signal from the ions is too faint to be caught by the camera, the amplitude noise
from the light source becomes more dominating."

This randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated differences between causes of death (COVID-19 vs. other causes) in baseline levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in people bereaved during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the effectiveness of unguided online grief-specific cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was examined in reducing PTSD-levels in people bereaved during the pandemic. The sample consisted of adults bereaved during the pandemic for at least three months, with clinically relevant levels of persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD), PTSD, and-/or depression. Participants were randomized to an intervention- (n = 19) or waitlist condition (n = 33). Intervention consisted of eight-week unguided online grief-specific CBT. Using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), PTSD symptoms were assessed through telephone interviews at pre-treatment/pre-waiting (T1) and post-treatment/post-waiting (T2). First, an independent samples t-test showed no significant differences in baseline PTSD-levels between people bereaved due to COVID-19 and people bereaved during the pandemic due to other causes of death. Second, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that participants in the intervention condition showed significantly lower PTSD-levels than participants in the waitlist condition, indicating a treatment effect of the online CBT. However, a meaningful statement about implementation of the online CBT in clinical practice can be made when future research replicates the results and examines the long-term effects."

Individual differences in DP may play an important role in the relation between CF and safety behaviours. It was hypothesized that (1) CF and COVID-related safety behaviours are significantly positively associated and (2) this association is moderated by DP. Hereto, a survey was performed in 179 participants from the general population (124 females and 55 males). CF was measured using the Padua Inventory Contamination Subscale, COVID-related safety behaviours was measured using the Coronavirus Safety Behaviours Scale, and DP was measured using the Disgust Propensity and Sensitivity Scale-Revised. Two control variables were added to examine whether they confounded the results, namely health anxiety (HA) and fear of COVID-19. Results showed that CF was significantly positively associated with COVID-related safety behaviours, whereas DP did not significantly moderate this association. Moreover, when controlling for HA and fear of COVID-19, CF explained a statistically significant amount of variance in COVID-related safety behaviours scores. Lastly, a significant positive relationship was found between CF and DP. When utilized in psychotherapy, CF and DP may improve existing therapeutic interventions and provide greater opportunities for acquiring a deeper understanding of behavioural changes during contagious diseases and beyond."

Therefore, the present cross-sectional study investigated whether the current energy crisis impacts individuals’ anxiety and well-being levels and whether these relationships are mediated by preventive behaviors. The data were collected in Germany, as this country has been severely affected by the energy crisis. 219 participants from the general population completed a questionnaire including the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and information on the impact of the energy crisis and preventive behaviors. Data were collected via Qualtrics. Correlation, linear regression, and mediation analyses were used to analyze the data. The results showed that energy crisis was associated with increased anxiety levels. An association of energy crisis with well-being levels was only found when controlling for trait anxiety. Therefore, this finding should be interpreted cautiously. Additionally, the energy crisis predicted preventive behaviors, although preventive behaviors did not predict anxiety symptoms. Therefore, only a partial mediation was found between energy crisis and anxiety. Factors negatively associated with anxiety symptoms included a low education level, young age, being female, and using preventive behaviors. Limitations included subjective measures, a young sample with 69% of participants aged between 19 and 29, almost 65% of university graduates, and no prior clinical assessment.

The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between anxiety and anger, and whether this relationship could be affected by emotion regulation and relationship satisfaction. It was hypothesized that anxiety will significantly predict anger, and that both emotion regulation and relationship satisfaction will negatively moderate this relationship. 

In a quantitative correlational study, 103 participants (n=103) completed a series of questionnaires on anxiety, anger, relationship satisfaction, emotion regulation, and negative affect. The results showed that anxiety correlates significantly and positively with anger. Moreover, emotion regulation moderated the relationship positively between the main variables, and relationship satisfaction moderated them negatively. Overall, the study seeks to contribute to our understanding of the role of emotion regulation and relationship satisfaction in managing negative emotional states like anger and anxiety.

"The relationship between stress, academic burnout, and emotion regulation strategies","['Čapková, Jana']","['Overveld, Mark van']",2023-05-23T00:01:05Z,EN,[],Clinical Psychology,"Objective: The literature illustrates an association between perceived stress and academic burnout (AB). However, research exploring the role of emotion regulation regarding this relationship is sparse. Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether cognitive emotion regulation strategies moderate the relationship between perceived stress and AB. Understanding this could help raise awareness regarding AB prevention and develop effective preventative strategies. Method: This study employed a quantitative correlational design. Ninety-three participants completed a Qualtrics survey, 60 females (𝑀𝑎𝑔𝑒= 22.48), 31 males (𝑀𝑎𝑔𝑒= 23.23), with one person not disclosing gender. The survey included questionnaires on current mood, perceived stress, cognitive emotion regulation strategies use, academic burnout, and neuroticism. Results: The findings revealed that perceived stress significantly predicted AB. Overall use of adaptive and maladaptive regulation strategies did not moderate the relationship between perceived stress and AB. When exploring emotion regulation strategies individually, only rumination moderated the relationship. Conclusion: The results suggest that emotional regulation strategies as a whole do not moderate the relationship between perceived stress and AB, but rumination individually does. This indicates that rumination affects students’ coping with stress and contributes to AB. This provides useful information for the preventative strategies development that could target specifically rumination. Nonetheless, this novel study is limited by its cross-sectional design not explaining the relationship causality. Hence, replication studies employing experimental designs are warranted."

Statistical analyses were conducted, and data revealed that contrary to predictions – holding optimistic beliefs regarding the afterlife was associated with higher grief levels. While strength of belief was non-significant, partial support was found for H2 as bereaved participants with optimistic BA were more likely to indicate that these beliefs were beneficial. Lastly, no significant difference was found between those who believed that loss weakened or strengthened their beliefs in terms of optimistic of pessimistic BA.

Since 2021 the painting is at KIK-IRPA, Brussels for restoration which will shed light on technical aspects that should be considered. 
This study aims to re-evaluate the function of the Hoogstraten panel by comparing it with other examples of horizontal panels in north-western Europe – in the Burgundian holdings in the Southern Netherlands, Germany (Augsburg) and parts of France (Avignon and Paris) – in the period between 1400 to 1500. Aspects such as socio-historical context, iconography, patronage, original provenance, and setting will also be discussed. Therefore, this study is divided into two chapters; the first starts with some general notions of measurements and guilds’ regulations for the region of Flanders, followed by an iconographical analysis of seventeen panels of the ‘corpus’. In the second chapter, the paintings’ functions will be studied. Here some clarifications regarding misunderstandings in previous scholarship are made. Respecting the painting Scenes from the Life of St Joseph, essential data will be evaluated and also an attempt to clarify the provenance, patronage, and function. 
As a result, this first systematic study of the Hoogstraten panel concludes that whatever the identity of the painter, he was aware of both Campin’s and Van der Weyden’s models, as well as of the Netherlandish painting panorama. In the lack of further evidence, it is impossible to determine the patron, provenance, and panel’s original function, but some options are given which might lead us to conclude that it was used as an altarpiece in the altar of the guild of St Joseph of Hoogstraten at Sint-Katharinakerk."
The Role of Gender on the Relationship between Childhood Trauma and Social Anxiety Disorder,"['Tegelaers, Maxine']","['Boschloo, Lynn']",2023-06-01T00:01:31Z,EN,"['parents with psychological problems, social anxiety disorder, childhood trauma, sexual abuse, physical abuse, gender']",Clinical Psychology,"An important risk factor for developing social anxiety disorder (SAD) in children of parents with psychological problems is childhood trauma, especially sexual and physical abuse. In addition, gender seems to moderate the relationship of childhood trauma with SAD, with a stronger relationship for girls than for boys. This research investigated the role of gender in the relationship between childhood trauma and SAD severity in children of parents with psychological problems. Although SAD shows high comorbidity, previous research often does not adjust for comorbid disorders. Data in the present study was derived from the  baseline assessment of the Adolescents At Risk of Anxiety and Depression (ARIADNE) study in 516 adolescent and young-adult children. Regression and moderation analyses were used to test the relationship between childhood trauma and SAD severity, between sexual and / or physical abuse and SAD severity, and the possible role of gender herein. Analyses were controlled for comorbid disorders. A differentiation was made between unadjusted and adjusted regression analyses. Adjusted analyses controlled for seven other disorders, for sleeping problems, and for somatization symptoms. Unadjusted analyses showed no significant relationship between childhood trauma events and SAD severity, but a significant relationship between physical and / or sexual abuse and SAD severity. All adjusted analyses but one showed a non-significant result; the relationship between childhood trauma and SAD turned into a negative relationship. Gender had no moderating role in any of xthe relationships between trauma subtypes and SAD severity. Given the different results between the adjusted and unadjusted analyses, comorbidity seems to play an important role. In addition, age of the sample could be an explanation for not finding expected results, since SAD has an onset between 12-15 years, while the age of the current sample ranged from 13 to 25 years old."

video formats, specifically in relation to the objectification of the female body and the male
gaze. BFM is a marginalised genre partly due to its highly sexualised use of lyrics by either
male or female artists but mainly due to it having negative connotations, in particular from
white upper-class groups in Brazil. The first chapter provides a contextualised explanation of
BFM and an overview of feminism in popular music and in the genre followed by the main
theoretical angle used including the works of Fredrickson and Roberts on objectification
theory and the male gaze theory by Mulvey. The second chapter uses secondary case studies
on female BFM artists music videos before diving into the case study of Brazilian
singer-songwriter Ludmilla’s music video “Rainha da Favela” using Vernallis’s book and the
male gaze theory. With Brazil having structural racism and being a misogynistic country, I
decided to only shed light on female artists’ and bypass male artists’ due to the
male-dominated music industry. The study highlights Ludmilla’s portrayal of herself as the
queen of the favela, using her sexuality as a weapon, and emphasises the significance of her
professional freedom as co-director and choreographer. It also examines the need for a more
nuanced understanding of gender roles in music videos, as they can both reinforce and
challenge gender stereotypes and inequalities. This study provides valuable insights into the
representation of female artists in music videos, contributing to ongoing discussions on
gender and media representation. However, it did not look into the effects it may have on the
viewer, which suggests a need for further research."

nitrogen (N) in vascular plants. In order to grow and reproduce optimally, plants must
maintain an internal balance between C and N while responding to changes in
external availability. Although the C and N metabolic pathways are individually
well-studied, mechanisms for regulating C and N levels are complex and
multi-levelled, and several important details regarding how the C/N pathways interact
to maintain balance are still unclear. This review examines how different fields in
biology view the problem of resource allocation such as evolutionary biology,
developmental biology and biophysics, using representative examples to show the
strengths and weaknesses of each perspective. Furthermore, we highlight some key
questions to be answered by each field to form a unifying picture of the system as a
whole. The review concludes by suggesting that a combined approach is needed to
inform future models, and gives some suggestions on what aspects of current
perspectives present useful properties to be considered for such models. Special
emphasis is given to the interpretation of signals, and a need for deeper inquiry into
how a signalling molecule’s spatiotemporal dynamics and functional involvement in
the C/N metabolic pathway can affect the potential information it carries to inform

One such impact pertains to
changes in water quality resulting from the generation and transportation of ash into bodies
of water. The quantity and content of this ash can affect the water quality, and thereby the
drinking water supply. The Mediterranean region and Portugal specifically, have been, and
are increasingly expected to be affected by fire-induced water contamination. Current
research has focused on local evaluation of impacts, as well as the global identification of
areas at risk. What lacks is the assessment of fire-induced water contamination risk at an
intermediate scale, which can be used as a basis for the efficient allocation of efforts
mitigating this risk. This study performed a risk assessment of Portuguese reservoirs based
on their historical exposure to wildfires, their drinking water dependency and their
vulnerability to fire-induced water contamination. A general risk index was established
through the creation and combination of hazard and exposure indices, reflecting a reservoirs’
drinking water dependency and historical exposure to wildfire respectively. The former was
based on data on the yearly water uptake from drinking water facilities at a reservoir. The
latter was based on the processing of 32 years of historical data on wildfires and reflects to
which extent and frequency reservoirs’ watershed areas have been burned. This was
followed by further analysis at local scale, consisting of (1) a more relevant method of
measuring exposure that includes historic reservoir volumes, as well as (2) an exploration of
the vulnerability of several water supply systems. This study has produced a nationwide
overview of fire-induced water contamination risk as well as of the degree to which the
hazard and exposure concepts contribute to this risk. Numerous differences were found
regarding the degree to which individual reservoirs are at risk. These can be ascribed to
various regional differences, concerning vegetational, meteorological and land use
conditions, as well as local differences as a consequence of water infrastructure design,
mitigation measures and the availability of alternative sources. Hence, these results can be
used to identify areas at risk, and to evaluate what type of mitigation measures should be
implemented and to what extent. Further analysis on exposure has provided an improved
method of estimating the exposure of a reservoir to fire-induced water contamination. This
measure estimates the yearly probability of the occurrence of significant changes in total
suspended sediment concentrations for individual reservoirs. Further analysis on
vulnerability has most importantly shown that increasing the size and interconnectivity of
water supply systems decreases their vulnerability to fire-induced water contamination.
These findings contribute to the understanding of fire-induced water contamination risk in
Portugal. Further studies can improve on this work by (1) applying the improved exposure
measure and exploring the correlation between reservoir volume and fire size, (2) creating a
more detailed hazard measure that possibly includes the dependence on other water
sources and (3) assessing and including projections on the possible impact of climate
change and its effects on meteorological and vegetational conditions."
Quantifying in Vitro Transcription,"['Visser, Thomas']","['Kegel, W.K.']",2023-06-11T23:00:36Z,EN,"['DNA transcription, Grand Canonical ensemble, T7, RNA Polymerase, quantitative, gene regulation, Broccoli, in Vitro']",Nanomaterials Science,"Gene regulation is of major interest in molecular biology as it the first step in a complex multi-step process which eventually leads to gene expression. Understanding gene regulation means being able to better understand how certain genes come to expression and what exactly affects gene expression. In biological cells, genes code for proteins. The production of proteins is regulated by a complex regulatory network involving regulatory proteins (transcription factors).
Each gene competes for transcription factors with a complex array of binding sites on the genome. Genes often exist in multiple identical copies, for example in the process of chromosomal replication during the cell cycle. Predicting the quantitative effect of this competition on the regulation of gene expression is of great interest. In this Project we use a model to quantitatively predict the transcription rate. In this model the grand canonical ensemble is used to construct a statistical mechanical probability that a transcription factor is bound to its specific site. To measure transcription we make use of a sequence called Broccoli. Broccoli allows us to measure transcription in vitro quantitatively in real time. The model is then adapted to the experimental system and compared to the experimental measurements.
RNA polymerase and the amount of DNA were varied and the corresponding change in transcription rate was observed. The experimental results were compared with the grand canonical model with which
we calculated the occupation of the promoter sites. The model can be adapted to account for unexpected competition by plastic surfaces by adding a competitive term. This competition can be prevented by adding BSA to the system, simplifying the system. With this method and model we have a strong foundation to study transcription quantitatively.
This will allow for systematic studies of gene regulation."
"Communism versus Capitalism, as far as erosion is concerned","['Spank, Menno van der']","['Lammeren, Ron van']",2023-06-10T00:00:55Z,EN,[],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"The aim of this thesis is to prove that the difference between former political rule on either side of the Czech-Austrian border has caused a difference in the rate of erosion. The Czech Republic had communist influences after the Second World War, and this caused strong land consolidation in the Czech farm parcels. This while the Austrian parcels did not change this much. The theory is that soil flowing downhill encounters more parcel boundaries on the Austrian side. A parcel boundary forms a natural barrier that hinders erosion and therefore the Austrian side should experience less erosion. To achieve the aim of this thesis the following three sub questions were conceived, (1) what are the differences in parcel characteristics on either side of the border, (2) what is the rate of erosion on either side of the border and how big is the difference and (3) with climate change in mind, what does a future prediction on erosion look like? Erosion was modelled using the so-called WS Model, this results in a raster map with the value of erosion or sedimentation per cell in kilogrammes. After summing these negative (erosion) and positive (sedimentation) cell values, per side of the border, it was found that overall the Czech Republic experiences erosion and Austria experiences sedimentation. After adding up the raster cell values per catchment, it turns out that on both sides of the border there are catchments eroding but also catchments with sedimentation. To prove that the difference in former political regime is the cause of the now proven difference in erosion, the values of erosion were this time added up per classification within certain factors that could possibly also be the cause. The number of parcels per square kilometre were also counted per catchment and the average parcel size per catchment was recorded. For each catchment, the summed value of erosion was also known. The comparison between these numbers did not prove that catchments with larger parcels experience more erosion. The only factor that can be said to influence erosion is the relationship between the parcel direction and the direction of the aspect. However, this is not the culprit behind the difference in erosion on either side of the border, because parcels with the right correlation in terms of this direction relationship are equally common on either side of the border. This thesis was able to answer the three sub questions. The parcel characteristics were clearly different. The average size of the 582 analysed Czech is 12 hectares and the average size of the 5.573 Austrian parcels is 1,2 hectares. This while they roughly cover the same surface area. The Czech side is experiencing a rate of erosion of -4.022.259 Kg while the Austrian side experiences 756.607 Kg of sedimentation. In the catchments that experience erosion, the erosion will increase in the future. The catchments that experience sedimentation, will increase in sedimentation. This thesis has not been able to establish with certainty whether the difference between former political rule on either side of the Czech-Austrian border caused the difference in the rate of erosion."

Dit is gedaan vanuit drie verschillende invalshoeken; ruimtelijk, structureel en lokaal. Het ruimtelijke deel is statistisch onderzocht en werd onderbouwd door het concept ‘the geographies of discontent’. Deze theorie gaat ervan uit dat er bepaalde geografische regio’s bestaan waar de inwoners vanwege hun sociale, economische en demografische kenmerken pessimistischer zijn dan landgenoten wonend in andere gebieden van datzelfde land. In het eerste deel is gekeken of aan de hand van deze kenmerken de avondklok-rellen verklaard konden worden. Uit de regressieanalyse bleek dat de variabelen bevolkingsdichtheid, migratiesaldo en criminaliteitspercentage statistisch significant waren ten aanzien van de aanwezigheid van rellen. 

In het tweede, structurele deel zijn de rellen onderzocht aan de hand van krantenartikelen en een aantal al gepubliceerde rapporten over de rellen. De structurele factoren van rellen zijn de organisatie, motivatie en repressie. Uit het onderzoek bleek dat de avondklok-rellen gekarakteriseerd kunnen worden als georganiseerd, gemotiveerd door verschillende redenen en getracht onderdrukt te worden door de politie door de rellen te voorkomen nog voordat zij konden beginnen. Tevens is in dit hoofdstuk ingegaan op de impact van ruimtelijke verspreiding van de rellen door Nederland. Deze verspreiding werd geleid door sociale of geografische processen die mensen aanzetten het vertoonde gewelddadige gedrag uit andere plekken te kopiëren. Het daadwerkelijke proces van verspreiding werd geleid door verschillende social media platforms. Zij vormden de zenders waardoor beelden en berichten over de rellen daadwerkelijk konden worden verspreid en gaven de mogelijkheid met anderen hierover online te communiceren.

Bij de lokale invalshoek is gekeken naar welke lokale factoren van invloed waren op de avondklokrellen. Hiervoor is een specifieke casus onderzocht: de Schilderswijk. Dit is onderzocht aan de hand van krantenartikelen en rapporten. De resultaten lieten zien dat de geschiedenis en identiteit van de wijk erg belangrijk zijn in het ontstaan van rellen. Tevens kwam naar voren dat een groot deel van de deelnemers bij de rellen niet uit de wijk zelf afkomstig waren. Deze resultaten kwamen veelal ook terug in andere buurten binnen de onderzochte gemeenten."

It shows that the coupling of a particle to a reservoir of two-level systems can lead under certain conditions to a long term oscillation of the particle. This thesis revisits this research from a time crystal perspective and aims to understand the parameters controlling the time crystalline phase. The particle-bath system is essentially a modified Caldeira-Leggett model and can be solved analytically. By examining the position of the particle and the pole structure of its Laplace transform, we can conclude that a time crystal phase is indeed present. The parameters that govern this phase are the damping constant, the temperature, and the long term properties of the bath. Depending on these parameters, we observe either persistent or decaying oscillations. Investigating the pole structure, we find properties that describe a phase transition between these two phases."

Therefore, the SCI population may be especially needful of therapeutic slow-breathing interventions to mitigate the impact of altered autonomic control of the heart and blood vessels and to improve the efficiency of respiration. Therefore, we assessed cardiovascular variabilities during 7 minutes of uncontrolled breathing, controlled breathing at 0.25 Hz and at 0.083 Hz, and ujjayi breathing (0.083 Hz with expiratory resistance via throat constriction) in 12 individuals with SCI from T8 to C4. Beat-to-beat heart rate and blood pressure was measured as well as end-tidal CO2 and oxygen saturation. Compared to uncontrolled breathing, all controlled breathing increased coherence between systolic pressure and RR interval variabilities at the respiratory frequency (0.71 Hz vs >0.85 Hz, p<0.05). The phase relation was shifted by 0.25 Hz breathing to a markedly positive, feedforward relationship (–4° vs +43°, p<0.05), whereas both 0.083 and ujjayi breathing shifted it to a markedly negative, feedback relationship –45° and –44°, p<0.05). Moreover, compared to uncontrolled breathing, 0.25-Hz breathing markedly decreases variabilities at the respiratory frequency in both RR interval and systolic pressure; 0.083-Hz breathing has no effect, whereas ujjayi markedly increases both variabilities (all p<0.05). While 0.25 Hz and 0.083 Hz breathing had variable effects on end tidal CO2 and oxygen saturation, only ujjayi breathing decreases end tidal CO2 and increases oxygen saturation while also resulting in a modest tachycardia (all p<0.05). These findings suggest that slow yogic breathing with respiratory resistance (ujjayi) shifts cardiovascular control to a baroreflex- mediated feedback mechanism and increases both mean heart rate and its variability such that there is improved ventilation-perfusion matching, resulting in increased systemic oxygen saturation. understanding the impact of respiratory changes, such as increased work of breathing, and exploring interventions that can improve respiratory function, cardiovascular control, ventilation-perfusion matching, and oxygen saturation is crucial in the SCI population to manage respiratory complications, enhance respiratory function, and optimize overall health and well-being."
The role of the cerebellum in emotional modulation: implications for the treatment of depression.,"['Buzăţoiu, Iulia']","['Honk, Jack van']",2023-06-13T01:01:15Z,EN,"['cerebellum, depression, emotional processing, TMS, fMRI, negative affect,\ncorrelational study.']",Neuroscience and Cognition,"The cerebellum is the brain structure which is generally associated with movement, coordination, and equilibrium. However, studies performed in the last three decades revealed its involvement in emotional processing and the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, with an emphasis on unipolar and bipolar depression and schizophrenia. Major depression disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mood disorders that has become one of the leading causes of disease in the world. It is a life-threatening disorder due to its prevalence with suicidal ideation and further comorbidities. Therefore, it is imperative to find clinical treatments that can minimize the impact of the disorder. The cerebellum has been associated with depression in multiple research setups at a structural, functional, and molecular level. Morphological cerebellar changes in the form of decreased cerebellar volumes and white matter aberrations are observed in patients suffering from MDD. Additionally, cerebellar activation is observed through imagining setups in patients compared to controls, denoting altered activity focused at the cerebellar levels. Lesion studies and cases of cerebellar damage have shown that patients display depression symptoms. This has been collaborated via neuronal stimulation, which shows that the excitatory stimulation of the cerebellum leads to an increase in positive mood, whereas inhibitory stimulation leads to a decrease in mood and inability to identify with emotions, typical of the MDD symptomology. The exact role of the cerebellum in the propagation of the disorder remains unknown, however, the recent data makes the cerebellum a structure of interest in MDD. Promising new studies have shown that the cerebellum could be used as an additional target for depression therapies, via the use of stimulation therapy or as a potential depression biomarker for a subset of MDD patients. Therefore, the cerebellum is a new yet exciting potential target for improved clinical treatments for depression."

As the capabilities of the internet and advanced technology (such as AI and VR) become more prevalent, the data center industry is expected to grow. Despite the opportunities afforded by digital infrastructure, data centers are reported to also have notable spatial and environmental impacts —including significant energy usage. These consequences are apparent in Amsterdam which has become a leading European hub for colocation data centers. In the social sciences, notably in the field of smart cities and critical data studies, there has been limited empirical research on data centers. Existing research has examined the social and the environmental implications of data centers but there has been less examination of the impact these facilities have on urban infrastructure and how they are governed. Using Amsterdam as a case study, this research uses a sociotechnical analysis of networked infrastructure and examination of smart urbanization as well as cloud geographies and ecologies to explore the impacts of data centers on spatial planning and energy grids and how they are governed. The research concludes that data centers have benefitted from the reliability of energy grid and influenced the local governance of energy grid development.

Peripheral T cell responses in treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors,"['Wees, Stefanie van der']","['Wijk, F. van']",2023-06-13T01:01:20Z,EN,"[""Checkpoint inhibitors, cancer, immune-related adverse events, T cells, PBMC's""]",Infection and Immunity,"Relevance and explanation
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are a potent treatment against cancer. The immune system has immune checkpoints in place to keep the balance between inducing an immune response and maintaining tolerance. Cancer can exploit these immune checkpoints by inducing tolerance, making it hard for the immune cells to effectively clear cancer cells. ICI were developed to block this cancer-induced tolerance and unleash a potent anti-tumour immune response. This treatment has proved to be very efficacious and has transformed the field of cancer treatment. However, not all patients are responsive, and the treatment is often accompanied by toxicities called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). ICI-induced toxicity is partly dependent on the type of ICI treatment. Still, most patients develop an irAE ranging from mild to lethal, independent of treatment type. The current treatment of these irAEs is with immunosuppressants that dampen the immune response alongside with the anti-tumour response. This calls for alternative treatment strategies for irAEs. In addition, we must find tools that can guide clinicians in assessing what (ICI) treatment is most beneficial for the patient, concerning response and the risk of developing toxicity.
Aim of study
Comparing the dynamics of T cells in patients’ blood, before and during treatment, could clarify some of the underlying mechanisms in ICI treatment regarding response and toxicity. It might also aid in finding potential biomarkers that predict toxicity and treatment outcomes. Additionally, it could help identify new targets in the treatment of irAEs.
Study design
In this study, we investigated the peripheral T cell responses of cancer patients under treatment with ICI. We used the blood samples of cancer patients receiving two different types of ICI treatment: monotherapy or combination therapy. Within these two groups, half of the patients developed irAEs that required medical attention, while the other half did not. We assessed the immune cells retrieved from their blood samples, taken before they started treatment and after the first and second dose, or when they developed toxicity.
Results
We found that an increased CD4+/CD8 +T cell ratio is increased in patients that respond to treatment without developing toxicity. Secondly, we found that the levels of LAG-3+CD8+ T cells were elevated at baseline, in patients without clinical benefit. This subset could have potential predictive value in treatment outcomes. ICI treatment induced a stronger decrease in IFN-y-expressing CD8+ T cells in toxicity-developing patients. More CD8+ T cells expressing co-inhibitory receptors, unable to produce IFN-y were also observed in this group. Granzyme- B-producing PD-1+, LAG-3+, and memory CD8+ T could be associated with toxicity and its severity. Combination therapy induced more (PD-1+)CD4+ memory T cells compared to monotherapy which could possibly contribute to toxicity development as well.
Conclusion
We identified interesting trends in peripheral T cell responses related to toxicity and response. These findings will need to be confirmed and clarified in further research but could contribute to the knowledge of the underlying mechanisms in ICI treatment, as well as aid in the search for predictive biomarkers for toxicity and response."

To address this research gap, this study explored the relationship between JLCG and work centrality within a cultural context, examining a collectivistic group of 138 Greek participants and an individualistic sample of 123 Dutch participants. Results revealed a positive association between work centrality and JLCG, in addition to higher work centrality scores in the individualistic culture. The moderation analysis, however, did not confirm a moderation role of culture in the relationship between JLCG and work centrality. The implications of this study allow identification of individuals at risk of developing JLCG.

However, bio-based SAF (bio-SAF) and electro-SAF (e-SAF) both require substantially more land compared to the production of conventional jet fuel, as fossil sources have higher energy densities than biomass or renewable electricity. The current body of literature on sustainable aviation is missing an extensive land use comparison between bio-SAF and e-SAF production routes, while land use is an important environmental indicator of the energy sector. This research aims to fill that gap, by constructing a model which includes all necessary chemical conversions and maps the required utilities such as hydrogen, electricity and heat. The included routes are hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), alcohol to jet (AtJ), biomass to liquid (BtL), CO2 hydrogenation and methanol upgrading (e-MeOH) and CO2 upgrading to SAF through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (e-FT). Land should be used as efficiently as possible, so hybrid solar & wind farms and combinations of bio-SAF and e-SAF production are examined in this research. 
 
The results show that e-SAF production uses 10 – 20 times less land compared to bio-SAF for the same amount of fuel production. This is mainly due to biomass harvests only taking place once a year, while CO2 capture and electricity production can take place continuously. However, e-SAF production requires 5 – 30 times as much electricity due to the large hydrogen demand, energy consumption of DAC and heat supply. As electricity is also becoming a scarcer resource, the trade-off between land and electricity requirements needs to be made for the production of SAF. It is expected that bio-SAF routes are a viable alternative to fossil jet fuel the next few decades as they are further in development and have lower costs compared to e-SAF. E-SAF routes are expected to be the better option towards 2050 when DAC and electrolyzers are further developed, costs have decreased and renewable electricity is more abundantly available. Combined routes are also an alternative, as electricity requirements are lower compared to individual e-SAF routes in exchange for slightly higher land use."
Field margins in the Hoeksche Waard for biodiversity and natural attenuation,"['Otte, Jasmijn']","['Verweij, Pita']",2023-06-14T23:00:40Z,EN,"['Field Margins, Biodiversity, Natural Attenuation, Ecosystem Services']",Environmental Biology,"Nowadays, the need for a transition to sustainable agriculture is increasing, following the decline in farmland biodiversity and other environmental issues due to the intensification of agriculture. A decline in biodiversity can affect the delivery of ecosystem services, including those that are important for agricultural practices. The RIVM is developing a social cost-benefit analysis of the implementation of field margins based on ecosystem services. Within this project, this study focused on the effect of field margins on the ecosystem services ‘biodiversity’ and ‘natural attenuation’ in the Hoeksche Waard in two scenarios: arable land and arable land with field margins. Models for biodiversity and natural attenuation were developed and implemented: (1) attributes were identified that could be used to quantify the delivery of an ecosystem service or the subfunctions underpinning the ecosystem service, (2) a conceptual multi-attribute model for quantification of biodiversity and natural attenuation was developed, (3) input data and information on the potential attributes was collected and organized in tables, (4) the collected data was used for calculating ecosystem services for the two scenarios (arable fields with and without margins). The implementation of field margins in the Hoeksche Waard, with reference value 1 for arable land without field margins, had a positive effect on the biodiversity (biodiversity capacity: 1.31-1.81) and natural attenuation (natural attenuation capacity: 1.78-2.06). The results of this study can be used as information for the social cost-benefit analysis, together with the other non-monetarized ecosystem services. Furthermore, this information is valuable for creating awareness on sustainable agriculture and shows the importance of future research relating to functional agrobiodiversity and sustainable agriculture."
Powering Europe with sun and wind - A pan-European analysis of overbuilding intermittent renewables with proactive curtailment,"['Eldik, Ruben van']","['Sark, Wilfried van']",2023-06-13T01:01:13Z,EN,['Intermittent renewable energy; Firm power; Curtailment; Transmission; Large-scale integration'],Energy Science,"The European Commission has set a goal of becoming the first net-zero emission continent. To achieve this, their REPowerEU proposal aims to increase the share of renewable electricity generation to 45% by 2030. The proposal includes tripling the current solar photovoltaic capacity and more than doubling the current wind power capacity. As the share of intermittent renewable energy sources on the grid increases, it becomes even more important to find ways to transform this intermittent power into firm power: power that can meet demand at all times.

In this study, we develop a model to determine the optimal mix of solar photovoltaic power, wind power, lithium-ion battery storage, and hydrogen storage that can guarantee firm power for 37 European and neighboring countries. We accomplish this by developing a model that optimizes the deployment of production and storage capacities and the hourly dispatch of storage and interconnections. Our Pan-European Intermittent Renewable Overbuilding and Curtailment Optimization Model (PEIROCOM) uses the demand and interconnection capacity projections of the European Resource Adequacy Assessment (ERAA) as input. Bidding zones have a copper plate assumption and are modeled as nodes only connected through HVAC and HVDC interconnections. The potential for onshore and offshore wind energy, as well as underground hydrogen storage, is considered. The model finds the optimal deployment and dispatch values using linear programming in combination with the time-hierarchical solution method.

We demonstrate that it is technically and economically feasible to meet the electricity demand of the entire European grid using only solar PV and wind power. We showed for the first time that overbuilding and proactive curtailment is feasible on a continental level and that hydrogen storage can play a significant role in reducing system costs when overbuilding generation capacity. Our results indicate that the ideal firm kWh premium in a lithium-ion-only scenario would be 3.95, with 51% of all generated electricity curtailed. When hydrogen storage is added, the firm kWh premium falls to 2.95 while reducing the curtailment to 32%. Additionally, we showed that with proactive curtailment, most of the projected 2030 interconnections could handle a fully intermittent renewable grid; an increase in interconnection capacity does not significantly reduce system costs."

Preventive measures against antifungal resistant Aspergillus fumigatus strains: translating the fundamental microbiological approach into a socially feasible prevention model,"['Romano Olmedo, Paco']","['Cock, Hans de']",2023-06-15T00:00:51Z,EN,"['Antifungals, Antifungal resistance, Antimicrobial stewardship, Fungal infection, Aspergillus fumigatus, Invasive aspergillosis']",Environmental Biology,"Fungal infections are a rising threat for human health with an annual causing up to 1.5 million deaths. While research has found a reasonable arsenal of antifungal compounds to combat the infections, emerging resistances against the compounds have alerted health institutes over the world. In 2022, the World Health Organisation (WHO) published its first report on the dangers of pathogens from the fungal kingdom in the form of a priority list. One of the four fungal species that were classified as critical priority is the opportunistic saprophyte Aspergillus fumigatus. The review utilises the emergence of azole-resistant A. fumigatus species as a framework. The overuse of azole-like fungicides has stimulated the development of cross-resistances with clinical antifungals, resulting in higher failure in therapies for invasive aspergillosis (IA) patients and increasing mortality rates. The ubiquity of the pathogen makes containment of spores nearly impossible, clearing the way for resistant strains to be inhaled by immunocompromised individuals. Increasing efforts in microbiological and pharmaceutical research and development may pave a way for novel antifungal compounds to be developed in the future. While these investments should not be thwarted or discouraged, combatting the threat requires more than increasing contributions of resources. Dual-use of antifungals in agriculture and clinics will eventually start the process over again. The WHO report mentioned it as well, the most effective manner of handling the threat is through large-scale regulation and monitoring of which antifungals are being used, what resistances are dominating in the atmosphere and where the strains firstly emerge. Introducing a global surveillance and regulatory project comes with struggles and organisational issues that surpass the scope of medical microbiology. Getting a majority of the world’s nations to commit to preservation of novel antifungals for clinical use and invest resources in surveillance and innovation requires the expertise of many different fields to propose an agreement that is effective and organisationally feasible."
Testing an effect of retrieving positive Self-knowledge on Self-esteem level and stability in response to Social feedback,"['Polášek, Dominik']","['WIll, Geert-Jan']",2023-06-15T00:00:59Z,EN,['self-esteem; CBT-based intervention; social evaluation task; depression'],Clinical Psychology,"Objective: Low self-esteem is both characteristic as well as a risk factor for mental health problems, such as depression. CBT-based interventions, for instance, Competitive memory training (COMET), boost self-esteem and mitigate depressive symptoms. However, cognitive mechanisms that can explain how such interventions have a lasting effect on self-esteem are unclear. This study examined whether a brief CBT-based intervention boosts state self-esteem and protects it from fluctuations in response to social feedback. The study also explored whether individual differences in these effects can be explained by variations in subclinical depressive symptomatology. Method: Participants (n = 43; 𝑀 = 23.37, 𝑆𝐷 = 2.73) completed a social evaluation task before and after undergoing a CBT-based intervention or control manipulation. The intervention (n = 22) entailed writing and visualising tasks aiming to activate positive self-knowledge, whilst the control (n = 21) condition involved tasks designed to elicit neutral emotions. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) ascertained depressive symptomatology (Kroenke et al., 2001). Results: The intervention did not significantly boost nor protect self-esteem from fluctuating, irrespective of reported subclinical depressive symptom level. State self-esteem level negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. The social feedback received through the social evaluation task resulted in self-esteem fluctuations, dropping after disapproval and increasing after approval. Conclusion: It is difficult to understand the cognitive mechanism since no significant boosting effect has been detected, possibly due to not providing sufficient space to retrieve positive memories or insufficient power. Nonetheless, this study establishes a ground for future studies, that may consider incorporating qualitative assessment, recruiting clinical samples, or modifying the intervention."
The impact of storage conditions and aquifer heterogeneity on Aquifer Storage Recharge (ASR) system’s performance,"['Cifuentes Pérez, Jose']","['Zech, Alraune']",2023-06-15T00:01:23Z,EN,['ASR; heterogeneity; recovery efficiency; hydraulic conductivity; buoyancy.'],Earth Surface and Water,"Aquifer Storage and Recovery systems (ASR) are an alternative source of fresh water to the increasing demand
for water. Its performance varies in terms of flow parameters, aquifer conditions and transport processes. An
axisymmetric 50 m thick base model is defined to simulate ASR performance by using Modflow, MT3DMS
and Seawat. The heterogeneous setting is defined as an alternation of high-K and low-K layers, where different
hydraulic conductivities, contrast ratios and anisotropy factors are simulated for homogeneous and heterogeneous
cases. Under the numerical approach the anisotropy factor in the homogeneous cases is the independent
variable, while in the geological approach, the heterogeneous layers are the independent variable. The numerical
approach makes different scenarios comparable and has a greater impact on the high-K layers’ vertical conductivity
KV while the geological approach leads to realistic simulations and has a greater impact on the low-K
layers’ KV . Higher values of KV lead to a greater buoyancy effect and tilting of the fresh-naive water interface.
Homogeneous cases have a better performance than heterogeneous cases, mainly during the first years of simulation.
Peaks on RE after 4 or 6 years of simulation in heterogeneous cases can be explained by the transfer of
fresh water to a high-K layer from an underneath low-K or high-K layer due to buoyancy. Homogeneous cases
have a better performance than heterogeneous cases. RE is more impacted by KV than horizontal hydraulic
conductivity KH, as it controls the amount of buoyancy. In heterogeneous cases, buoyancy in high-K layers is
the main responsible for the reduction in RE compared to the homogeneous equivalent cases.

Television is pointed to as a strong influence on teenager’s sexual identity formation, knowledge on the LGBTQIA+ community, and the (re)production of gender and sexuality norms. Therefore, it is important to study queer representation in teen television series. The Swedish teen series Young Royals (Netflix, 2021-) shows a seemingly awareness of intersectionality and recognizes the struggling relationship between monarchies and modern-day society, making it an interesting case study of queer representation. Therefore, this research made a textual analysis of Young Royals, with the aim of answering the following question: How is intersectionality represented through the characters of Wilhelm and Simon in the teen series Young Royals? The concept of intersectionality is used to see what ideologies the series embodies.
Following Leslie McCall’s intercategorical complexity approach, this thesis focuses on the categories of sexual identity, race, and class within the series’ first season. To analyze Young Royals on a textual level, John Fiske’s theory of codes of television is employed to examine how the different layers of their complex identities are portrayed and thus represented. The textual analysis has shown that class was highlighted more for Wilhelm and Simon than the categories of sexual identity and race. The technical and social codes that transmit the conventional representational codes to shape the representation of ideological codes seem to embody the ideologies of traditionalism and classism. Instead of problematizing queer identity and focusing on sexual identity like many other queer teen series, Young Royals problematizes the social issues that queer people are facing by showing how Wille and Simon navigate their intersectionality. Young Royals centers social issues that are relevant today, like discrimination caused by the social class system and the traditionalism of monarchies, leading to the marginalization of social groups such as queer people."
Moral limitations concerning the use of animals on social media and the role of the veterinary professional,"['Jansen, Jasper']","['Meijboom, Franck']",2023-06-16T00:00:43Z,EN,['ethics; animal rights; utilitarianism; relativism; ideal theory; social media; anthropomorphism'],Geneeskunde van gezelschapsdieren,"This thesis reviews the practice of using animals for social media purposes from the perspectives of utilitarianism and the animal rights view, and discusses the responsibility veterinarians have in this context. The positions of both theories with regard to this practice of animal use are made clear using relevant normative and empirical arguments. This analysis is combined with the input from semi-structured dialogue sessions on the subject. These dialogue sessions show how people seemingly hold beliefs which are exclusive to either one of the theories simultaneously. The undesirable consequences of this are subsequently discussed, and arguments against ideal theory are refuted. This leads to an argument for choosing one particular ethical theory which ought to be followed when faced with any moral problem, including that of the ethical use of animals on social media. The decision which ethical theory this ought to be is reached by using the outlined utilitarian and rights
perspectives on the moral issues central to this thesis to consider what accepting either theory would mean for how veterinarians ought to act. By appeal to our considered beliefs, the animal rights view is acknowledged as superior. Based on the animal rights view, the moral duties of veterinarians in the context of using animals for social media purposes are discussed. Finally, suggestions are made on how the current veterinary education system should change to adequately equip veterinarians to be able to fulfil the duties which result from an animal rights perspective."

creativity, with varying results. The present study focuses on empowering leadership as a 
relevant relatively novel form of leadership. In this study, the benefits of empowering 
leadership were investigated in relation to the important organizational assets engagement and 
creativity, as both engagement and creativity have been shown to be key drivers of 
organizational success and competitive advantage. Moreover, openness to experience was 
included since personality traits have also been studied in relation to both creativity and 
engagement with successful results. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to examine 
the effect of both empowering leadership and openness to experience on creativity and to 
investigate the mediating role of engagement. A sample of 70 employees from different 
organizations was surveyed to gather data. Results of regression analysis showed that higher 
levels of empowering leadership resulted in lower levels of engagement amongst employees. 
As for openness to experience, results showed that higher levels of openness to experience 
were associated with higher levels of creativity. Looking at the relation between openness to 
experience and creativity, mediation analysis showed that engagement did not mediate the 
effect of openness to experience on creativity. The findings have important implications for 
organizations as both openness to experience and empowering leadership have been shown to 
influence important work outcomes."
Modulating tDCS effects through expectations and reward,"['Wiegman, Dimitry']","['Klaus, Jana']",2023-06-15T00:00:53Z,EN,[],Neuropsychology,"Previous studies regarding sham tDCS have indicated that expectation priming (Rabipour et

reward promise affected reaction times and accuracy on a flanker task during sham tDCS.
Participants were divided into four groups, receiving either positive or neutral expectation
priming, and either a reward promise or no reward promise. A two-factor ANOVA was used
to analyse the data. Results indicated no effects of expectation priming nor reward promise on
reaction times. Results did indicate that participants who were positively primed made less
errors compared to neutrally primed participants. Similarly, participants receiving the extra
reward instruction made less errors compared to participants in the no reward condition. The
current study findings suggest that expectation priming, and reward promise are able to
modulate sham tDCS effects. One important note is that the current study only included sham
tDCS, therefore conclusions comparing active and sham tDCS cannot be made. We discussed
our current findings and how these relate to previous studies. Recommendations were made
for future research regarding investigating the effects of expectation priming and reward in

Cell wall signalling in flooded plants,"['Yan, Alex']","['Sasidharan, R.']",2023-06-20T00:00:43Z,EN,"['cell wall; flooding; pectin, PME, de-methyl-esterified pectin; wall-associated kinase; THESEUS1; FERONIA']",Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"You may have noticed that giving your houseplants too much water is harmful to them. It limits their
ability to take up oxygen from the air, which causes them to suffocate. The symptoms are that their
leaves will hang down and decay of the roots. Excessive watering in the form of floods can destroy
crops in the same way that it can hurt your houseplant. Floods have major consequences for the
quantity and quality of agricultural food production. According to the Food and Agriculture
Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), floods contributed to 65% of crop damage and loss induced
by natural disasters between 2006 and 2016. Heavy rainfalls, causing severe floods, are more likely to
happen in the future due to the impacts of climate change. Our current and future food supply is
seriously threatened by the impacts of floods. Therefore, we must develop innovative agricultural
technologies to combat crop yield loss caused by water stress.

One area of research that can help with this goal is the development of new varieties of crops that are
more resistant to long-term floods. When plants experience floods, they develop all kinds of
adaptations that help them to survive. For example, plants develop new organs that help them prevent
suffocation. Understanding how plants perceive flooding stress and how this perception results in the
development of these adaptations is necessary knowledge to develop flood-resistant crops. For
example, this knowledge would allow opportunities to arise for future researchers to develop new
crops that respond faster and more intensely to floods.

One mechanism that plants use to become aware of their surroundings is by determining the status of
their cell walls. It uses the cell wall as a sensing tool to detect harmful growth conditions, such as hot
and cold temperatures and drought conditions. Thanks to these mechanisms, plants can respond
quickly to these stresses, allowing them to survive these harmful conditions. Although the cell wall
status plays a significant role in the perception of several damaging growth conditions, its role during
flooding stress is hardly investigated. Therefore, we asked the question: “Are cell walls also involved in
the perception of flooding stress in plants?”

To find an answer to this question, we searched the literature for potential cell wall sensing mechanisms
that are active during floods. Here, we merged the expertise of two distinct research fields by
combining the knowledge of (1) plant mechanisms and adaptations during floods and (2) plant cell wall
sensing mechanisms. In this review, we concluded that there is enough evidence to believe thatsensing
the cell wall status is needed for plants to undergo adaptations that help them plants to survive floods.
The most prominent role is reserved for the cell wall component, pectin. We believe that during floods,
the pectin changes in form. Consequently, we believe that this is perceived by the plant, and they
undergo adaptions that protect them against floods. With this report, we contributed to the field of
science by providing credible theories of potential explanations of how plants trigger adaptations
during floods, which eventually contributes to the efforts to limit food loss caused by floods."

Dit kwam de afgelopen decennia ook in Nederland prominenter naar voren.
Zowel de burgemeesters van de vier grootste Nederlandse steden (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Den Haag en Utrecht) als minister-president Mark Rutte hebben de afgelopen twee jaren excuses aangeboden, hoewel onderzoek van I&O Research (2021) liet zien dat het merendeel van de Nederlanders het hier niet mee eens was. De media hebben uitgebreid verslag gedaan over het excuusdilemma, maar halen vooral de debatten die politiek Den Haag voert aan (Van Praag & Brants, 2014). In hoeverre sluit dat beeld aan op de daadwerkelijke visie van de natie?
Dit heb ik onderzocht aan de hand van de reactiesectie onder het op 30 juni 2021 gepubliceerde YouTubefilmpje ‘Het slavernijverleden en het excuusdilemma’ van NOSop3, bestaande uit 1809 reacties van 991 gebruikers. De hoofdvraag luidde: hoe wordt een maatschappelijk discours in de reactiesectie van het YouTubefilmpje ‘Het slavernijverleden en het excuusdilemma’ van NOS op 3 gevoerd? 
Aan de hand van distant reading en close reading (Jockers, 2013) heb ik de reacties geanalyseerd. De analyses maakten inzichtelijk hoe een kleine groep gebruikers zeer actief deelneemt aan een vrij anoniem discours dat met name oplaait in de maanden rondom het sinterklaasfeest en Keti Koti. In reacties met zeer informeel taalgebruik geeft het gros van de gebruikers aan het niet eens te zijn met het aanbieden van excuses. Er bestaat echter een discrepantie tussen de gemiddelde reactie en de toon van de “populaire” reacties die veel zijn geliked: de veel gelikete reacties laten zich in vergelijking een stuk gematigder of zelfs positiever uit ten opzichte van het aanbieden van excuses. Kennelijk zijn gebruikers die deelnemen aan het discours door likes uit te delen, het meer met deze reacties eens.
Door een digitaal discours als dit in de toekomst vaker te onderzoeken, kan men een beter begrip verwerven van de houding van burgers betreft maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen naast het geformaliseerde, geïnstitutionaliseerde debat."
Efforts of aid in an unfriendly haven,"['Stokvis, Daan']","['Frijtag Drabbe Kunzel, G.G. von']",2023-07-13T00:01:38Z,EN,[],History,"The depiction of Switzerland as a safe haven in the historiography about so-called Jewish self-help during the Second World War has been a main cause of the lack of scholarly interest in Jewish organizations that in Switzerland tried to help fellow Jews. A good example is the Joodse Coördinatie Commissie (JCC). This Jewish organization was created by Dutch Jewish refugees Max Gans, Siegfried Isaac, and Salomon Troostwijk on January 20, 1944. Samuel Van Dantzig was included as a member in March 1944. Between January 1944 and June 1945, the JCC tried to help suffering Dutch Jews via Switzerland. Only Jacques Presser, Lou de Jong, and Katja Happe have studied this Jewish aid organization in detail. In their research about the JCC, they mainly focus on Gans and his difficult relationship with the Dutch authorities in Switzerland and London. Leaving a lack of research into Isaac, Van Dantzig, and Troostwijk.  
All three historians have used the JCC as a case study within the Dutch historiography about the role of the Dutch government in exile in the Holocaust. In this debate, these three historians indicate that the Dutch government did too little to help Dutch deported Jews. Presser, Happe, and De Jong use the JCC as an example of this lack of government support toward the Jews during WW2. With this focus on the JCC as a case study, the source material used in the previous research into this organization has been limited. Presser, Happe, and De Jong mainly cite sources that show the problematic relationship between Max Gans and Dutch officials working for the Dutch government in exile or the Dutch embassy in Bern. Due to this limited and specific usage of sources, with a particular focus on the quarrel between Max Gans and the Dutch government, the dynamics and cooperation between the four members of the JCC are not researched by Happe, Presser, and De Jong. A new analysis of the JCC, with attention or the internal dynamics in the JCC, and the cooperation between its four members, is necessary.
I have operated this new research into the internal dynamics, and cooperation of the JCC members by answering the following question: What factors influenced the internal cooperation in the Joodse Coördinatie Commissie between committee members Gans, Isaac, Troostwijk, and Van Dantzig, between January 20, 1944, and April 1945? I have chosen this period because on January 20, 1944, the JCC was created, and in April 1945, committee members Troostwijk and Isaac were no longer part of the JCC. I have answered my research question with the use of three dimensions.
These three dimensions narrate the different factors that influenced the workings of the JCC and its members. The belief dimension is set in the minds of the four members and entails their ideas related to the help towards Dutch Jews and cooperation with authorities. These ideas were already formed before the escape of the JCC members to Switzerland. The circumstance dimension refers to the space around the members and the JCC itself, and entails what Gans, Isaac, Troostwijk, and Van Dantzig faced during the JCC’s existence, such as the Swiss dealing with Jewish refugees during the Second World War. The social dimension entails the social contacts of the JCC members, such as friends and family, and how these contacts influenced their work as commission members and the functioning of the JCC itself.
In the first chapter, I describe the lives of the four JCC members before this organization was created in January 1944. This chapter provides insights needed for understanding the believe systems of the four protagonists and a background to their social networks and ties. The focus is on roles and experiences before arrival in Switzerland and pre-existing social contacts: what similarities and differences can we discern between the four men? Chapters 2 and 3 deal with the period after arrival"
Effect of protest participation and community involvement on youth’s life satisfaction and role of Transnational Social Movement Organizations (TSMO),"['Liew Pei Chin, Pei Chin']","['Leeuwen, Marco van']",2023-07-13T00:01:43Z,EN,['youth civic engagement; protest; community involvement; Transnational Social Movement Organizations'],Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems,"Youth participation in social movements has spread globally in the last decade. The youths are engaging in diverse forms of “Do-It-Ourselves” activities to address social issues. Despite this, there remain youths who are civically apathetic. Given that Transnational Social Movement Organisations (TSMOs) have facilitated social changes in the past, they could serve as incubators for youth civic development. This postulation was based on the social capital theory: TSMOs could enrich youth’s social network, develop agency and competence in a prosocial environment. Hence, to understand how the civic participation trend has evolved since the waves of youth activism in 2011, this paper addressed these questions: How has the trends for European youths’ participation in protests and community involvement evolved from 2006 to 2018? To what extent, does youth participation in these civic activities influence life satisfaction? To what extent, does the presence of TSMOs moderate the type of youth’s civic action? Using the European Social Survey and TSMO databases, the study found an increase in youth civic engagement over time and found that community involvement is more popular than protest participation. Based on the analysis of covariance, youths who participated in community involvement had significantly higher life satisfaction than non-civically active youths in 2006, but not 2018. No significant difference between youths who participated in protest and the non-civically active youths were found. TSMOs did not moderate the relationship between the protest and community involvement and life satisfaction. Policy interventions for encouraging community involvement should take into consideration youth’s preference for less formal structures and institutions, and for TSMOs to evolve to attract and engage youths into their organisations. Future research could extend the study to non-Western countries as TSMOs have spread globally and to empirically test the social capital theory mechanism for civic participation and life satisfaction."

It is a major genre in the current French musical landscape. From its origin, French rap has been a protest genre, denouncing the poverty in the banlieues and the discrimination towards Black, Arab, or Muslim people in France. This research draws on postcolonial and memory studies to offer an analysis of French rap as conveying a dissonant memory. Analysing the mention of antiracist and anti-colonial figures, it shows how Médine, Kery James and Youssoupha offer carefully curated memories of these figures through their songs. I examine to what extent their work contributes to the public debate on French colonial history. 
Throughout the thesis I argue that rappers act as public historians and memory activists, transmitting to their audience the memory of historical events and figures that are marginalised in the French national narrative. Rappers contribute to memory work or devoir de mémoire of a dissonant memory by paying tribute to antiracist and anti-colonial leaders. Moreover, the artists place themselves in line with the anti-colonial and postcolonial struggles through reference to these figures, thus showing the continuity between past and current struggles in France. The figures are also used as cultural references. The thesis engages with song lyrics, popular press and YouTube responses, and with the rappers’ biographies to show how they do memory work in France. It concludes that while rappers have a strong influence on public debate within their fan network, they are less influential in the wider public debate."

The city of Amsterdam was used as a case study to
examine whether residents’ satisfaction with social infrastructure is associated with neighbourhood social cohesion. Additionally, this study tested whether the strength of this relationship varied between privileged and deprived districts in Amsterdam.

The two-by-two framework and five dimensions of social cohesion were used to conceptualise neighbourhood social cohesion. Place attachment theory and social disorganisation theory were discussed to shed light on possible mechanisms between the satisfaction with social infrastructure and neighbourhood social cohesion.

Data was extracted from the Basisbestand Gebieden Amsterdam (BBGA) (N = 18,296). Factor analysis distinguished two key dimensions of social spaces – socio-economic and recreational spaces – which were treated as separate independent variables to measure neighbourhood social cohesion (N = 884). District SES was added as a moderation variable.

Findings suggest that social infrastructure plays a significant role in promoting social cohesion, and that the type of social infrastructure that is most effective may vary depending on the socio-economic context of a district. These findings carry important implications for future research and policymakers as they could be used to design more inclusive and accessible social infrastructure to promote neighbourhood social cohesion. This study recommends policymakers to enhance bonding and bridging capital of residents in Amsterdam, which can be achieved through the novel policy instrument ‘participatory budgeting’."

Employees involved in dirty work must manage societal stigmatisation in such a way that it does not cause them to turnover, as retaining a sustainable work force in times of relative tight labour markets is important. The Job Demands-Resources model is used in combination with the Social Identity Theory of Intergroup behavior to assess how working conditions impact dirty work employees’ turnover intention. Job demands incorporated are employees’ perceived discrimination, work intensity and job insecurity. Incorporated job resources are employees’ level of social support, autonomy and flexibility. Using ISCO-08, a list of occupations deemed dirty was created. Then, through personal contacts and contacts with labour unions, a survey was distributed amongst dirty work employees. Responses were analysed using multiple linear regression. Perceived discrimination and job insecurity were found to positively impact dirty work employees’ turnover intention, whereas social support was seen to negatively impact their turnover intention. The degree of stigmatisation was not seen to carry any effect. Perceived discrimination and job insecurity seem to form a threat to employees’ ability to form a positive self-definition, whereas social support seems to aid this formation. To reduce employee turnover intention, employers are recommended to implement transparent decision-making processes. Employees, too, could strive for implementation of these processes through collective bargaining by a labour union or Works Council."
Breasts and Eggs: Reproductive anatomy in Early Modern Amsterdam,"['Berg, Estel van den']","['Huistra, Hieke']",2023-07-13T00:01:36Z,EN,[],"Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance Studies","In Amsterdam in the late 17th to early 18th century, the world flocked towards the anatomical museum of Frederik Ruysch. A large part of Ruysch’s collection consisted of anatomical preparations related to sex, conception, and generation. Many people contributed to the existence of the museum aside from the anatomist himself; the buyers of the preparations, the visitors, the midwives who brought Ruysch bodies, and of course the pregnant people. My research focused on how much individual actors around Ruysch contributed to the spread of knowledge concerning reproductive anatomy. My research concerns insofar medical models of pregnant bodies became public knowledge and what the social consequences were for pregnant people in the past. 
The focus on the social dimension is important because the social history of pregnancy is as complicated as it is culturally relevant. By focusing on the people around the anatomist rather than Ruysch himself I hoped to fill a lacuna in current research. Taking a bird’s eye view on the topic of reproductive anatomy in Amsterdam in the 1700’s I found that concerning the distribution of knowledge dead bodies had more agency than living bodies. I also found that some knowledge was deemed fit for the public, while other information was kept hidden on purpose out of either virtuous motives or financial concerns. Financial concerns also shaped the presentation of the museum, which heavily relied on a communal imagination of vanitas. I found that pregnant bodies became public in 18th-century Amsterdam, which mainly disadvantaged pregnant people but also gave them new opportunities."

Technological developments bring many opportunities but are also accompanied by disadvantages. Previous studies find diverging results of digitalisation on life satisfaction, often referring to digital divide between those who are digitally competent and those who are not, that arises as a result of digitalisation. This study answers the question whether being digitally competent affects life satisfaction and whether this effect is mediated by social capital. Based on several theories, including the modernity theory, digital divide theory, digital capital theory, constant presence theory, time displacement theory and hierarchy of needs theory, hypotheses were derived. After conducting multiple regression analyses with European Social Survey data, the results showed a significant positive effect of digital competence on life satisfaction. This positive effect is partly mediated by social capital. The effects remained significant after adding control variables (income, health, age, etc.). In addition, the descriptive results show that the difference in digital competence levels between European countries is large, with frontrunner countries also having room for improvement. This study demonstrates the urgency of improving digital competence levels in Europe, in order to increase the life satisfaction of European citizens. A more unified vision and standardised training program from the European Commission regarding increasing digital competence is therefore advised."

In deze masterthesis is door middel van Historical Institutionalism en een comparative historical analysis gekeken in hoeverre de instituties van de Nederlandse energiesector hieraan hebben bijgedragen en hoe dit zich verhoudt met Denemarken en Duitsland die meer succes hadden met hun hernieuwbare energiebeleid. Historical Institutionalism is een geschikt invalshoek om te gebruiken omdat naar voren is gekomen dat keuzes uit het verleden veel invloed hebben gehad op het hernieuwbare energiebeleid later. Verder is het vergelijken van deze casussen is interessant omdat de drie casussen relevante overeenkomsten hebben. Zowel Nederland, Denemarken als Duitsland zijn geïndustrialiseerde en moderne democratieën met een evenredige vertegenwoordiging die niet veel kunnen inspelen op waterkracht en zonne-energie, maar toch verschilt het aandeel hernieuwbaar energie sterk tussen deze landen. Verder kan Nederland een interessante casus zijn omdat het neoliberalisme dominant werd binnen het Nederlands beleid, vooral na de jaren negentig. Meerdere artikelen beargumenteren echter dat liberale instrumenten en liberale markteconomieën minder efficiënt zijn in het effectief beleid voeren voor het vergroten van het aandeel hernieuwbare energie. Door het gebruik van secundaire literatuur kan de institutionele context gegeven worden voor alle drie de landen, daarnaast wordt er vooral met beleidsdocumenten van het ministerie van Economische Zaken een analyse gemaakt van het hernieuwbare energiebeleid van Nederland. Dit onderzoek laat zien dat de keuzes die in het verleden zijn gemaakt een grote impact kunnen hebben op het latere hernieuwbare energiebeleid. Nederland koos vooral voor energiebesparing na de eerste oliecrisis (1973) waar Denemarken en Duitsland meer gingen inzetten op hernieuwbare energie. Hierdoor was in de jaren negentig hernieuwbare energie al meer geïnstitutionaliseerd in Denemarken en Duitsland. Daarnaast kwam naar voren dat het neoliberalisme sterk aanwezig binnen het Nederlands beleid en werd hier, ondanks dat de kritiek op het beleid toenam, ook aan vastgehouden Als gevolg hiervan probeerde Nederland tevergeefs aan de hand van marktinstrumenten de marktpenetratie van hernieuwbare energie te stimuleren waarin het ook de eigen economie wilde beschermen. Ook op andere onderdelen is er een continuïteit te zien in het beleid. Zo werd er in alle documenten verwezen naar het belang van Europees beleid en koos de overheid ervoor om samen te werken met bestaande spelers.

Academic discussions of media flows and contra-flows are revisited in this thesis to understand the nuances in these flows and the potential for occurrences of cultural exchange within this globally minded programming. 

Taking a close look at Netflix’s Tidying Up, starring Marie Kondo, this thesis examines reoccurring moments in each episode to deconstruct specific textual elements that are instrumental in understanding Kondo’s character construction, how her tidying ideologies and ideologies of neoliberalism are conveyed, and how this character construction and ideologies shape the show’s narratives. Using Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis as a methodology, I explore common reality television conventions like pre-taped in-studio segments, the introductory tease of the show, and homeowner tours and reactions to Kondo, leading me to argue the emergence of what I term a ‘blended contra-flow’. Largely due to the positioning of Kondo as a spiritual guru and the use of an interpreter and subtitles throughout the series, this blended-contra flow of cultural capital simultaneously flattens the Eastern cultural knowledge deriving from Kondo and also functions to promote cross-cultural understanding, all while promoting a neoliberal ideology that is commonplace in lifestyle makeover shows. 

While this is the first time that an American-produced reality television show featuring a non-American as the host/expert achieved mainstream success, it offers new perspectives on the flow of cultural capital and the implications of ethnic gurus in Anglo-American television."
One standard error cross validation criterion for tuning a classification prediction model,"['Fang, Zicheng']","['Luijken, Kim']",2023-07-20T00:01:00Z,EN,[],Epidemiology,"Abstract
Introduction
The one standard error (1 SE) criterion has been widely used for tuning hyperparameters (for example, the penalty term in L1 and L2 regularization) in cross validation (CV). Although it is common for clinical classification prediction model building, the performance of this criterion in terms of these following aspects remained to be investigated: (1) estimating standard error of CV error, (2) variable selection, (3) out-of-sample prediction error.
Methods
I conducted a full-factorial simulation study to evaluate the performance of the 1 SE criterion in logistic models in three aspects: accuracy of estimating standard error of CV error, the impact on variable selection, and prediction error performance. The parameters varied in this simulation were: data dimensionality, proportion of noise predictors, covariance between predictors and number of CV folds. A polynomial regression metamodel was developed to predict the true standard error of CV error, where a piece-wise metamodel was built in an iterative manner, evaluating R2, CV error, and p-values of simulation parameter coefficients to arrive at the best fitting metamodel. The metamodel was externally validated in test datasets which contained different values of simulation parameters and corresponding true standard errors of CV error. The values of simulation parameters in test datasets were randomly selected from different ranges.
Results
Results for the three aspects of performance of the 1 SE criterion in logistic models were: (1) the 1 SE criterion generally underestimated the 1 SE of CV error; (2) the 1 SE criterion in lasso selected less true predictors compared to models with the lowest CV error; and (3) models developed using the 1 SE criterion generally had worse out-of-sample prediction error than models with the lowest CV error, while it performed well in data with decaying coefficient structure and correlated predictors. The metamodel consisted of 4 pieces: a constant coefficient structure and independent predictors, a decaying coefficient structure and independent predictors, a constant coefficient structure and correlated predictors, a decaying coefficient structure and correlated predictors. The out-of-sample mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) for the 4 pieces of metamodel were 0.57%, 0.59%, 1.1%, 1.3%. The R2s on test datasets were 0.9955, 0.9969, 0.9886, 0.9895 for the 4 parts, respectively.
Discussion
Based on the three simulation experiments, I recommend the application of 1 SE criterion in data with high dimensionality, correlated predictors, small predictor coefficients values or a decaying coefficient structure. I estimated a metamodel to predict true standard error of CV error, but further theoretical and simulation studies are needed to explain the non-linear effects of data dimensionality on true standard error of CV error."

The Provisional Irish Republican Army was one of the main terrorist organizations and operated on a massive transnational scale for more than twenty years, but its European campaigns are hardly explored in historical research. The PIRA’s European campaign offers an interesting opportunity to dive deeper into European cooperation on a smaller regional scale. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the European states had created a complex network of practical and legal cooperation on counter terrorism in response to a new kind of shared threat: international terrorism. On a smaller, more regional scale, cooperation became increasingly necessary. PIRA-cells became especially active in the border area of Belgium, the Netherlands and West-Germany to target British servicemen. The Provisional IRA offers interesting insights in the securitization of terrorism. The Provisional IRA shows on a regional scale the nature and extent of counterterrorist coordination on a European scale. The various police teams worked closely together on a personal and informal base. The lack of standardized anti-terrorist legislation and national disagreements on how to prosecute terrorism frustrated the effective conviction of the PIRA-suspects. This mirrored the broader European counterterrorist effort.""""]"

I apply Robin van den Akker and Timotheus Vermeulen’s use of metamodernism to a close reading and comparative analysis of Sally Rooney’s novel Conversations with Friends and Joachim Trier’s film The Worst Person in the World. These works reflect the metamodernist structure of feeling, as they consider the effects of capitalism, digitalisation, and global crises in their characterisation of women from the millennial generation. Both protagonists’ romantic relationships portray skewed power dynamics that result in financial and emotional dependence, and a complicated engagement with the female body and motherhood. These elements highlight the juxtaposition of lingering patriarchal structures and progressive portrayals of contemporary women. Thus, Rooney and Trier illustrate a negotiation between continuity and change, as each change emphasises what has not changed. Tracing this negotiation in recent depictions of the female millennial in literature and film, suggests a productive approach in understanding the often misunderstood millennial generation and thus, offers potential solutions for change."
"Relevant Explanations in Formal Argumentation, an Empirical Study","['Scheffers, Roos']","['Bex, F.J.']",2023-07-20T00:01:10Z,EN,"['XAI, Argumentation, explanation, experiment, AI']",Artificial Intelligence,"The use of automated decision-making is becoming increasingly prevalent. Users of systems that make these decisions must be able to assess a system’s biases and have trust in it. Providing explanations for system decisions is one way to achieve this. Providing these explanations is the focus of the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) field. One technique used within XAI is formal argumentation. The logic used by an algorithm to arrive at a specific decision can be represented via formal argumentation structures. However, how such an argumentation structure can be translated into human-friendly explanations remains an open question. One concept formalized for explanations in argumentation that takes into account properties of human explanations is ‘relevance’. Informally an argument is relevant to another argument if there is a relation between the two, for example, by attacking or defending an argument. 
In this thesis, the concept of relevance was empirically tested by comparing explanations in formal argumentation based on relevance to explanations provided by participants. One hundred twenty-seven participants provided explanations for scenarios based on two different types of relevance. Based on the results, relevance in argumentation seems to align with explanations selected by participants. Participants preferred small explanations consisting of direct defenders, arguments that attack the attacker of an argument. However, further investigation is needed to determine whether the task’s difficulty affects this study’s results. Future work could build on the current work by expanding to non-acceptance and non-extension-based explanations and by investigating differences in explanation behaviour based on prior knowledge and goals of explanation."

Realising Transformative Change through the Evaluation of Urban Nature-Based Solutions: An Exploration of the Netherlands,"['Jaspers, Anouk']","['Bulkeley, Harriet']",2023-07-25T00:01:45Z,EN,"['Nature-Based Solutions, evaluation, transformative change']",Sustainable Development,"The dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss increase the vulnerability of cities, which are dealing with challenges of extreme weather events, degrading urban ecosystems and increasing temperatures. Nature-based solutions (NBS), which are actions that imitate and enhance natural processes in cities, can contribute to tackling these challenges whilst simultaneously improving the health and well-being of urban residents. However, trade-offs and issues of justice and equality limit the effectiveness of NBS to deliver their aspired multiple benefits to nature and all urban residents. It additionally hampers the mainstreaming of NBS in current urban infrastructure regimes, while their uptake is deemed crucial for the transformation of current regimes along more sustainable pathways. Currently, evidence remains scarce on the trade-offs and unintended consequences of NBS, which points towards the improvement of current evaluation processes to strengthen the evidence base of NBS. Enhanced evaluation processes can also foster the mainstreaming of NBS in practice by properly showcasing their potential. Therefore, this research aims to explore how evaluations of urban NBS currently capture the aspired multiple benefits of NBS, their possible trade-offs and issues of justice and inclusivity, and how this relates to the potential of NBS to contribute to transformative change. 
 
The research developed six evaluation principles, which are argued to capture the contribution of evaluations to the transformative potential of NBS. Furthermore, the research is based on an explorative but non-representative quantitative as well as qualitative case study analysis of 42 evaluation documents of Dutch urban NBS, supplemented by 10 interviews with practitioners in the field of researching and/or evaluating urban NBS. The research reveals that, overall, most of the evaluations adequately aligned with the six developed evaluation principles, meaning that these evaluations to some extent contribute to transformative change. However, the research also demonstrates that more than a third of the evaluation sample made no or only a limited contribution to transformative change, whilst especially the principles of justice and inclusivity are poorly addressed in the evaluations. Additionally, those evaluations being solely based on quantitative research methods are characterized by a lack of inclusivity and insufficiently address the principles of multiple benefits, trade-offs, and justice. These findings underpin the proposed improvements in the evaluation of urban NBS to enhance the transformative potential and uptake of NBS in practice. This supports the transformation of current urban infrastructure regimes to realize sustainable, just, and equal urban living environments for all residents."
A Protocol for Sampling Ecohydrological Traits in Nepal's Terai Arc Landscape,"['Cró Maycock, Stephen']","['Boer, Hugo de']",2023-07-25T00:01:39Z,EN,['ecohydrology; protocol; conservation; satellite;'],Water Science and Management,"The Terai Arc Landscape (TAL) of Nepal is a global priority conservation area for the Bengal
Tiger (Panthera tigristigris). The Bengal Tiger faces numerous threats to its survival, including
a decrease in prey availability as a result of the degradation and loss of critical habitats such as
grasslands and wetlands. Fluctuating groundwater tables can potentially contribute to the loss
of these habitats as grasslands thrive with shallower groundwater levels. The potential impacts
of human development and climate change on groundwater in the region necessitates the
investigation on the dynamic relationship between hydrologic and vegetation processes. This
Master's thesis forms a part of the ""Save the Tiger! Save the Grasslands! Save the Water!""
(Tiger) project that aims to contribute to the conservation efforts of tiger habitats in the TAL
through recognizing the significance of ecohydrology and its impact on these crucial tiger
habitats.
The primary objective of this research is to develop a protocol to facilitate the systematic
collection of consistent and reliable data on Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fractional Vegetation
Cover (FVC), and Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) - key parameters that describe ecohydrological
relationships. Moreover, a secondary objective is investigated, utilizing the data acquired
through implementation of the developed protocol to validate satellite products to explore the
potential of upscaling in-situ data.
The protocol demonstrated its ability to capture consistent and reliable data for LAI and FVC
across various vegetation types, showing potential for application across different regions in
the TAL. Additionally, the study explored the viability of a smartphone-based LAI method, the
PocketLAI, which proved to be a feasible alternative to the more established and high-cost
AccuPAR-LP80, albeit requiring further investigation on the effect of specific smartphone
models and LAI retrieval. While the protocol captured consistent SSM data, improvements are
necessary to enhance the reliability of these measurements. The validation of satellite products
revealed significant relationships with in-situ LAI and FVC. Despite largely underestimating
LAI and FVC values, the results have important implications for monitoring patterns of these
parameters across the TAL.
Further iterations of the protocol, implemented across different fieldwork campaigns within
The Tiger Project, are crucial for establishing a robust protocol. Such a comprehensive protocol
will have invaluable implications for conservation efforts towards tiger habitats and form a
fundamental platform for future research and analysis in the TAL."

Through an analysis of data and visualization, significant disparities and deviations from gender stereotypes are identified within and between the sectors. The findings reveal that while there are subtle differences in drives between the Government sector and Commercial industries, the overall dissimilarities are relatively minimal. The study reveals distinct gender-based patterns within each sector, illustrating variances in Dominance, Decision Making, Social Empathy, and Helping. However, these differences have minimal practical significance, as indicated by their small or negligible effect sizes. The study acknowledges limitations, including missing data and the absence of certain variables, and provides recommendations to advance gender equality in decision-making and establish inclusive work environments. In summary, this research acts as a guide for TMA, emphasizing the importance of challenging gender stereotypes, promoting equal opportunities, and ensuring fair treatment for employees regardless of gender."
Social Impact Through Inclusion: The Case of De Voorkamer.,"['Fiorini, Valentina']","['Alakavuklar, Ozan']",2023-07-25T00:01:49Z,EN,['Community Organising; Social Impact; Inclusion: Integration: Bottom-up Organisation;'],Organising Social Impact,"This study attempts to understand the relationship between De Voorkamer (a 
community organisation in Utrecht, the Netherlands) and its community and how social 
impact is created through this interaction. This is done through ethnographic research paired 
with interviews conducted with organisational members, volunteers and participants of De 
Voorkamer’s events. In addition, visuals are used throughout to better depict the processes at 
play.
The paper’s main findings suggest that the impact created through the relationship 
between De Voorkamer and its community is managed through a sense of inclusion and 
belonging within the space. Power dynamics play a role in this relationship since it 
determines the outcome of the inclusion and integration processes. De Voorkamer’s cocreation initiative was also seen as an empowering tool that creates a stronger bond with the 
organisation and a stronger sense of belonging. Social capital is also highlighted as a crucial 
ingredient for social impact, with the paper delving into how social capital is created through 
the inclusion process. Lastly, mental health benefits were a recurring theme within the paper 
as a spillover effect of the inclusion process.
The paper goes into ways De Voorkamer can improve its social impact creation. 
Specifically by increasing the accessibility of information about events and programs and 
providing more formal education opportunities. De Voorkamer could also benefit from more 
intentional impact planning and evaluation to ensure its programs and activities meet the 
community’s needs.
Overall, this study highlights the importance of community-led spaces like De 
Voorkamer for fostering inclusion and belonging among immigrants and refugees and 
strengthening ties within communities. De Voorkamer acts as a bridge between marginalised, 
disadvantaged groups and their social needs, which prevents them from the risk of social 
exclusion and the adverse outcomes which are associated with it. The study provides insights 
into how community-led spaces can empower marginalised communities and contribute to 
social and economic opportunities."
An analysis of future malaria intensity and climatic suitability in Uganda.,"['Hartgers, Tom']","['Karssenberg, Derek']",2023-07-25T00:01:55Z,EN,['malaria; climate modelling; Uganda'],Applied Data Science,"Malaria is a large health threat on the African continent. The transmission of the parasite is
highly dependent on precipitation and temperature levels. Relatively low temperatures in the
highlands of Uganda can be inhibiting the current spread of malaria. Future climate change
may therefore cause a shift in the climatic suitability for malaria transmission in this region.
This study uses downscaled climate projections of temperature and precipitation values in
Uganda from 2015 to 2099 generated by the MPI-ESM1-2-LR climate model. This data is
used as input for a simplified version of the Liverpool Malaria Model. The model
mathematically simulates several processes of the malaria transmission dynamics on a daily
basis for every grid cell of the input data. The output consists of the daily basic reproductive
rate (R0
). The rate serves as a measure for the climatic suitability for and intensity of malaria
transmission. Error margins for the climate projections are estimated through an ensemble
created on a spatial subset of Uganda and are combined with the input data. The malaria
model uncertainty is assessed through a sensitivity analysis using a one-at-a-time (OAT)
method. Results show an increase in areas where, on average, malaria will spread (R0 > 1).
This is most notable under climate change scenarios SSP3-7.0 (up to 24.1% of the area)
and SSP 5-8.5 (up to 34.7% of the area). Several high-altitude locations in the west and east
of Uganda show higher R0 values (R0 ≥ 2.5) starting from 2050. This is mainly caused by
high levels of projected precipitation in the aforementioned scenarios. These locations also
display the most notable increase in malaria transmission season length from 80 up to 120
days per year. The moment in time the season occurs appears stable. The error analysis
warrants caution regarding the interpretation of these results, showing high errors for
precipitation at high-altitude locations. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis indicates a model
that is highly sensitive to its parameter settings. Additional research needs to be carried out
to calibrate the model parameters and to validate the outcomes of the current contribution."

voor een organisatie. Hybride sportbonden hebben namelijk naast hun traditionele rol (voor en door
leden) ook een consumentgerichte rol en een informerende rol als belangenbehartiger van de sport.
Door dit complexe speelveld is het een balansoefening om voor alle stakeholders legitiem te blijven
en dat brengt spanningen met zich mee. Het besturen van een hybride sportorganisatie is daardoor
een uitdagende taak, waarbij het bestuur de verschillende belangen moet beheersen en tegelijkertijd
de legitimiteit moet waarborgen. De vraag is of dit nog kan met een model met een vrijwillig bestuur

Examining the Effect of Goal-Directed Peer Feedback on the Goal Setting Skills and Goal Quality of Dutch Vocational Education Students: An Achievement Goal Orientation Perspective,"['Doorn, Anne van']","['Wong, L.Y.J.']",2023-07-28T01:00:57Z,EN,"['self-regulated learning, achievement goal orientation, goal-directed peer feedback, goal setting, goal quality, vocational education']",Educational Sciences,"The present study examined the influence of achievement goal orientation on the effectiveness of goal-directed peer feedback in vocational education and training (VET), in which students train for practical, often technical occupations. VET students often lack motivation, which impacts their self-regulated learning (SRL) skills and is affected by their achievement goal orientation, i.e., their purpose behind achieving goals. Goal-directed peer feedback, i.e., exchanging feedback on personal goals, can support SRL and motivation. This underexplored field was investigated through a quasi-experimental research design with goal-directed peer feedback as independent variable, goal setting skills and goal quality as dependent variables, and achievement goal orientation as covariate. Achievement goal orientation was measured through survey, goal setting skills were measured through pre- and post-test surveys and goal quality through rubric scores. The study was conducted in a second-year course over four weeks with a control group (N = 15) and experimental group (N = 12). Results indicated no significant effect of goal-directed peer feedback on goal setting skills and goal quality, nor control by achievement goal orientation. Possible explanations include motivational and contextual factors as well as individual differences, which are to be considered in future interventions. Further implications, recommendations and limitations are discussed."

Kopkracht is a Dutch peer-to-peer intervention that tackles the mental wellbeing of high school students. In this paper we aim to evaluate the intervention by answering the research question: “Does the usage of peer-to-peer mentoring in the program Kopkracht contribute to a more complete definition of mental wellbeing and more openness about this topic in the context of the students’ school?”. Quantative data from a survey (N = 510), and qualitative data from three focus groups (N = 18) were used. Mixed results were found, with the quantative data being positive about the peer-to-peer aspect, and overall positive about the intervention. In the qualitative data there appears to be a distinction between the participants and the peer-trainers. The peer-trainers are positive about the intervention and the peer-to-peer aspect, but the participants see no added value to the peer-to-peer aspect. Levels of stigma also seem to be the same after the intervention. Adult-led workshops seem to be just as useful and more cost-efficient as peer-led workshops, however there is an added benefit for the peer-trainers."

school climate of secondary education in the Netherlands and describe what this can teach us about school culture. Despite the focus of previous research on bullying on an individual level, reports on bullying have remained stable or even increased over time. Therefore, more research has started looking at the underlying school culture through researching school climate using a lens of heteronormativity. To collect data, semi-structured interviews with 15 participants were conducted. Deductive coding and a lens of heteronormativity are used for analysis. The findings uncovered four notions of heteronormativity in school culture through experiences of school climate: ‘gender policing’, ‘sexuality policing’, ‘tokenism’ and ‘ignorance’. The findings call for practical implications such as providing multiple gender- neutral accommodations as well as implications for future research. In order to create a safer and more inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ students, schools need to stop taking a passive approach and start actively looking for heteronormativity in their own school culture and start resisting against it."
"The Relationship between Motivation and Mind Wandering: Learning Strategies as a 
Mediator","['Huijzer, Marieke']","['Kok, E.M.']",2023-07-28T01:01:09Z,EN,['Mind Wandering; Motivation; Learning Strategies'],Educational Sciences,"Students in tertiary education can experience negative mind wandering, defined as task-unrelated thought, during their individual study time. This can disrupt their focus and reading comprehension. Previous studies found that students’ level of motivation is related to their mind wandering. Additionally, it is found that the level of students’ motivation affects their use of learning strategies, as previous studies about the reduction of mind wandering have found methods that are similar to learning strategies. This study investigates if the relation between students’ motivation and their mind wandering is mediated through the use of learning strategies. Furthermore, this study examines which specific learning strategy plays a mediating role in the relationship between motivation and mind wandering. The data were collected from students in tertiary education in the Netherlands. The students’ mind 
wandering, motivation, and use of learning strategies are measured by existing questionnaires. The results showed that the relation between motivation and mind wandering is fully mediated through learning strategies. The strategies of time and study management, effort regulation, and help seeking appear to mediate the relationship between motivation and mind wandering. Concluding, the use of learning strategies forms an explanation for the relation between motivation and mind wandering. However, further research should be done to examine if promoting the learning strategies has an impact on student’s performance."

Climate Responsibility,"['Habets, Yves']","['Stok, Marijn']",2023-07-28T01:01:11Z,EN,"['Climate responsibility, individuals, Social Cognitive Theory']",Social Policy and Public Health,"The overarching aim of this qualitative study is to examine the variations in individuals' sense of responsibility regarding climate change and explore the underlying narratives and reasoning behind the presence or absence of a sense of responsibility in addressing climate change. Despite widespread recognition of the adverse consequences of climate change, variations in individual perceptions of responsibility remain poorly understood. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing targeted interventions, effective communication strategies, and policies that encourage behavioural changes and foster greater individual engagement in climate action.
The research utilized an existing dataset, ""Threat-Responsibility,"" comprising responses from 517 Dutch residents who answered an open-ended question about their feelings of being duped or as a causer of climate change. The collected data was analysed deductively using a predefined conceptual framework based on the Social Cognitive Theory.
The findings of this study highlight that individuals’ sense of responsibility for climate change is influenced by various factors, as reported by the respondents. These factors include self-efficacy, behavioural capability, self-control, and reinforcements. 
Addressing the issue of climate change may benefit from considering the importance of education and awareness. Empowering individuals to contribute and make a difference could be a valuable aspect in the fight against climate change. Implementing policy changes at various levels, ranging from local to global, might be necessary to address the issue effectively. Additionally, utilizing effective communication strategies may play a critical role in engaging the public and promoting a sense of personal responsibility towards climate change."

Circusing Societal Condition - An Inquiry into How Contemporary Circus Enters Unconventional Spaces in Taiwan,"['Yu, Tai-Jung']","['Groot Nibbelink, Liesbeth']",2023-07-31T00:00:51Z,EN,[],"Contemporary Theatre, Dance and Dramaturgy","This thesis investigates contemporary circus practices that enter unconventional spaces in Taiwan and how they reflect different societal conditions. As this research entails peculiar types of space in the real world and how the circus performances residing in these places reveal the abstract property of living conditions, the key theories deployed include locality proposed by Arjun Appadurai, structure of feeling proposed by Raymond Williams, double consciousness discussed both by Paul Gilroy and W.E.B. Du Bios, and the juxtaposition model of tradition and modernity raised by Hassan Hanafi. The conceptual tools developed for the subsequent performance analysis include the spatial, temporal and communal characters within structures of feeling, a focus on materiality for spatial investigations, and the modes of in-solution and of precipitate regarding sensing structures of feelings. In the case studies, I first analyze the promenade circus performance Disappearing Island by Formosa Circus Art in 2020. The performance concretizes the structure of feeling of the island with the wearable installations and participative scenarios, allowing the structure of feeling to be observed by the audience. This work further proposes questions about a co-sharing urban life to the audience and states the fragile and uncertain living conditions in contemporary society nowadays. The second case study focuses on Main Agile by Thunar Circus in 2022. The performance structure and the material composition of Main Agile show a juxtaposed mentality and brought about two modes of spectatorship, which leads to double consciousness. The double consciousness hidden in the work indicates the contemporary dilemma of living with a dual mentality caused by the irreconciled integration of tradition and modernity in a society like Taiwan. I argue that what lingers in these cases is the ghost of modernity. If the issues of contemporary uncertainty and the dilemma of duality can be solved, we must start with identifying the ghost of modernity and its influence, then proceed with motivating “the past” into something dynamic and alive, rather than static or unchangeable."

The task is termed neighbourhood selection and has many overlapping properties with a more extensively researched approach to solving VRPs - Large Neighbourhood Search (LNS). This paper explores how do GNNs compare to other methods of neighbourhood selection for optimizing the solution of VRP which are already developed within Dassault Systèmes ’ DELMIA, in collaboration with whom the current research is conducted.

VRP assumes a set of destinations that need to be visited by a set of vehicles and can be defined as a problem from graph theory. Because of this, GNN is considered a likely tool to approach solving the problem. In order to explore the method, sub-problems of VRP are represented as graphs, embedded via a GNN and compared in terms of how much optimizing them would improve the
overall solution. Multiple models assuming different graph representations are trained on that task. They are consequently tested in real-world-like scenarios, where a VRPs solution is iteratively improved by using the models to select the best neighborhood (or sub-problem) which is then optimized using aDassault Syst`emes ’ algorithm.

Through experimentation, this research project examines methods to represent VRP sub-problems as a graphs-input for GNNs, as well as how to make and compare GNN embeddings. It provides a proof of concept that a GNN is a feasible approach to neighbourhood selection for VRP optimization."

societal, environmental and economic implications. However, the specifics of these implications are still 
unknown. Using survey data collected among residents in Greater Sydney, Australia; Greater Montréal, 
Canada and the Randstad, the Netherlands, this paper presents an investigation into individuals`
willingness to adopt privately owned automated vehicles (PAVs) and shared automated vehicles 
(SAVs). The effects of personal characteristics and geographic features, as for example home region,
are also identified. 
The results reveal that perceptions about safety, personal gains, societal gains, sharing and 
optimism about technology play a significant role in the likeliness to buy a PAV or use a SAV. For both 
PAV and SAV adoption, understanding potential personal gains and safety improvement increase the 
likeliness to buy a PAV or use a SAV. The results of the analysis also suggest that age has a significant 
effect on the likeliness to buy a PAV or use a SAV. Having a carsharing membership has a significant 
effect on the likeliness of using a SAV and the number of cars in the household has a significant effect 
on the likeliness of buying a PAV. Home region has a significant effect on the likeliness to use a SAV, 
but not on the likeliness to buy a PAV. Respondents living in the Randstad significantly differed from 
the respondents living in Sydney. A lower odds of using a SAV suggests people in the Randstad are less 
likely to use a SAV. The findings suggest there may be differences between regions so policy-makers 
should look at region-specific factors."

bone pose in 3D using optical markers and a motion tracking system, while A-mode US transducers measure the distance to the bony surface. However, detecting the actual bone depth 
using A-mode US is challenging, and the accuracy of the depth estimations remains unclear. 
Therefore, this study aimed to assess how accurate the A-mode US transducers can measure 
skin-to-bone distance. Multiple preliminary experiments were conducted and the outcomes 
were described in the appendices of this report. The main study included one right lower leg 
of a human cadaver, supplemented with three US holders and a total of nine US transducers. 
US estimated depths were calculated using the peak time in the A-mode signal and the speed 
of sound in soft tissues, and validated towards the ground truth depths from simultaneously 
conducted Computed Tomography (CT) scans at Ultra High Resolution (UHR). Two consecutive 
CT scans resulted in 18 CT ground truth depths, which were derived from the segmented 3D 
models of the tibia and the US transducers. Four measurements were excluded, and initially, 
for 3 of the 14 remaining outcomes (21%), the selected peak in the US signal was incorrect. 
After selecting the correct peaks, the US measurement overestimated the CT ground truth 
depth in 12/14 cases, and underestimated in the other two cases. Using the standard speed of 
sound in soft tissues (1540 m/s), the mean and standard deviation of the absolute difference 
between US estimated depth and CT ground truth depth was 0.9192 ± 0.4850 mm, whereas 
the best fitting speed of sound for the current setup (1424 m/s, according to one of the preliminary studies) decreased the mean absolute error to 0.6293 ± 0.6872 mm. In conclusion, if 
the correct amplitude peak in the US signal can be identified, the A-mode US transducers are 
capable of measuring skin-to-bone distance in a human cadaver leg with mean absolute errors 
below 1 mm."

The normative focus is on ensuring that the copyright holders are protected, while balancing their rights with those of the AI developers who generate such models. This thesis begins by explaining the legal and economic rationale for copyright protection, and the economic value from both copyrighted materials as well as AI-generated ones. The impact of using copyrighted material in AI models on the rights and interests of creators, users, and owners is then critically examined, unveiling a myriad of ambiguities and uncertainties.

The thesis then delves into the worldwide, EU, and Member State level copyright legislation, noting that there is a need for more specific regulation on all levels. The three-step test of copyrightability unraveled through the legal analysis is deemed to be too vague for legal use, whereas the highly codified copyright exceptions previously known in the EU do not provide necessary guidance either. Given this context, the EU legal framework is analyzed and compared against the more flexible US framework, which is based on fair use principles. The thesis proceeds to argue that although a US-inspired framework would require grave changes to the EU legal system, it may benefit all stakeholders involved by providing a clearer, and quicker system to work with.

In chapter five, in light of the conclusions of Chapter four, recommendations are made to combat the challenges discussed throughout this thesis. They are ranked on their ability to be successfully implemented, as well as their enforceability from an EU perspective.

The assessment was conducted within the context of a regulatory flexibility framework, as it was observed that this approach would offer the optimal means of determining efficacy through the implementation of a regulatory sandbox. Well-scoring recommendations here relate to the opt-out provision, new licensing schemes, and worldwide regulations. Whereas DRM (digital rights management), and the fair use principles were more difficult to square with the said perspective. Finally, chapter six concludes by drawing the threads together of all points discussed in this thesis."

Evaluating the Effectiveness of an OOX based Symbolic Execution Engine,"['Smid, Tjeerd']","['Prasetya, Wishnu']",2023-08-04T00:01:07Z,EN,"['Symbolic Execution, SMT-solvers, OOX, SV-COMP']",Computing Science,"Symbolic execution is a program testing technique from the software verification domain. It involves symbolically modeling and testing all possible execution paths of a program against a set of constraints. The three main challenges of symbolic execution are (1) Memory modeling; (2) Execution path explosion; and (3) Constraint solving.

In this thesis, we present a Symbolic Execution Engine. This engine operates on the OOX
language and is equipped with eleven different heuristics. These heuristics aim to improve efficiency in handling the second and third challenges of symbolic execution.

We conducted an extensive experiment with our Symbolic Execution Engine. We used the benchmarking tools and a set of 81 benchmarking programs from the Software Verification Competition, and seven comparable verification tools, with the aim of investigating the effectiveness of the heuristics and substantiating the claims of effectiveness, soundness, and completeness of our Symbolic Execution Engine."
Spin transport coefficients from holography,"['Yan, Jiajun']","['Gursoy, U']",2023-08-04T00:01:24Z,EN,[],Theoretical Physics,"The hydrodynamic theory of spin current is a useful tool that can be used to describe different phenomena, ranging from the spin in liquid metal to the global spin polarization in heavy-ion collisions. Recently, exhaustive analyses of spin hydrodynamics have been performed and the constitutive relations are obtained. The spin coefficients that appeared in the constitutive relation are vital to the property of the spin current. The heavy-ion collision involves strong interaction so we can’t obtain these coefficients from the correlation functions in quantum field theory.
The holography principle, which implies we may use a classical bulk gravity theory to calculate the correlation functions in strongly coupled boundary quantum field theory, could be a method to calculate these spin transport coefficients. In this paper, we choose a simple vector field model as the holography model. This vector field is dual to the trace of contorsion in the hydrodynamic theory. We performed the calculation at an AdS-Schwartzschild background spacetime and we treat the background value of the vector field as a small number. We constructed the counterterms for the vector field action at the probe limit. We obtained Kubo relations for some spin transport coefficients base on a previous study of spin current hydrodynamics. We calculated these transport coefficients and found them proportional to the slow falloff mode of the vector field."

De twee bewegingen hebben allebei op belangrijke wijze bijgedragen aan dit debat, door onder andere hun ideeën over volkssoevereiniteit, periodieke verkiezingen, gelijkheid voor de wet en het idee van een sociaal contract wat is vastgelegd in een constitutioneel document. Voor beide bewegingen was het beschermen van de rechten en plichten van de burger, tegenover de macht van een heerser, van cruciaal belang. Dit legden beide bewegingen vast in voorgestelde constitutionele documenten, de Agreement of the People en de People’s Charter. De bewegingen lijken op het eerste gezicht erg van elkaar te verschillen, maar dit onderzoek beargumenteerd dat er meer overeenkomsten zijn tussen de ideologieën van de Levellers en de Chartisten dan vaak naar voren komt in de historiografie. Dit wordt allereerst aangetoond door een vergelijking tussen de vorm van de beide bewegingen en de politieke en religieuze context waarin zij zich bevonden. Daarna volgt een ideologische vergelijking die focust op sociaal-economische, religieuze, politieke en constitutionele argumenten die uit de ideeën van beide bewegingen blijken. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te achterhalen hoe de politieke ideeën van de Levellers terugkwamen in de ideeën van de Chartisten tweehonderd jaar later.""""]"

As a result, many expressions in these languages are shortened, and their meaning is inferred from the context. In this paper, we focus on the omission of the plurality and definiteness markers in Chinese noun phrases (NPs) to investigate the predictability of their intended meaning given the contexts. To this end, we built a corpus of Chinese NPs, each of which is accompanied by its corresponding context, and by labels indicating its singularity/plurality and definiteness/indefiniteness. We carried out corpus assessments and analyses. The results suggest that Chinese speakers indeed drop plurality and definiteness markers very frequently. Building on the corpus, we train a bank of computational models using both classic machine learning models and state-of-the-art pre-trained language models to predict the plurality and definiteness of each NP. We report on the performance of these models and analyze their behaviours."

In this study, we provide an overview of the literature on interactive data exploration and discuss existing approaches for placing glyphs in a 2D map. We formalise the problem of creating qualitatively good glyph maps as the Basic Glyph Placement (BGP) problem. We prove that this problem is NP-hard. We present a sound (though not complete) exact algorithm to solve it, inspired by Drezner's method for solving the continuous k-center problem.

Algorithm-assisted team formation in a software development business setting,"['Bron, Malou']","['Lykourentzou, I.']",2023-08-10T00:02:22Z,EN,"['Team formation, algorithm, human computer interaction, personality']",Human-Computer Interaction,"Many companies see a need in computationally-assisted team formation when their employee database keeps expanding. Most of these team formation algorithms are top-down which might result in approaching the team formation process as a mere computational prob- lem. By including the human component in the form of personality based information such as the Drivers test, we fill this gap. This study investigates the impact of driver-based team formation on teamwork within a business context, measured by work quality, well-being, and collabora- tion quality. Balanced teams are contrasted with unbalanced teams. The findings indicate that balanced teams outperform unbalanced teams in terms of work quality and collaboration qual- ity. The results indicate that balanced groups have a better objective score, an increased flexibil- ity among team members, enhanced decision-making abilities, reduced interruptions, are more vocal and positive collaboration, and have a improved collaboration efficiency. However, self- reported well-being does not differ significantly between the two team types, and unbalanced teams exhibit more positive interactions overall. The observed higher collaboration efficiency in balanced groups aligns with established theories of team formation stages, with unbalanced teams exhibiting a greater tendency for conflict and balanced teams achieving consensus more swiftly in problem-solving approaches and leadership dynamics. This study sheds light on the influence of personal drivers on collaboration within corporate environments and proposes the extension of the algorithm to incorporate job match, interpersonal compatibility, and expectation alignment. The study’s significance lies in its potential for organizations to strategically form higher-performing teams from existing employees, without the need for additional hiring, lead- ing to improved work quality and productivity. Leveraging the unique dataset provided by the Drivers test, this study fills a research gap and expands the understanding of how driver-based team formation impacts team dynamics and performance. Overall, this research contributes to the development of more efficient team formation algorithms, and advances the utilization of the Drivers test as a valuable tool in team composition studies."
Explaining the Effect of Procedural Content Generation on Frustration,"['Christodoulou, Dimitris']","['Bakkes, S.C.J.']",2023-08-10T00:01:55Z,EN,[],Game and Media Technology,"Procedural Content Generation (PCG) in games is a category of algorithms used to generate different kinds of assets, artifacts and behavior while the game is running, either in a loading screen or in realtime. There is some speculation that PCG can lead to unfair game states, which in turn can be a main cause for frustration in players. Frustration is mainly seen as a negative phenomenon, however, on the other end there is evidence that some frustration in games is necessary to ensure that the player does not feel overconfident and also is focused in the game. In this paper, we present a case that investigates how PCG affects frustration and if it leads to overtly negative frustration (and therefore aggression) or helpful and focus-inducing frustration (and therefore a state of flow). An experiment was conducted, and the participants were asked to play some consecutive Pac-Man games. During the experiment, gameplay data, as well as player behavioral data were collected from the players and were analyzed to determine the significance that PCG plays on the apparent frustration of the players. This data was also supported and enhanced by additional information collected by a questionnaire that the users were asked to fill out, which would gauge their feelings on the gameplay experience and whether they felt frustration or if they thought the game was balanced. The results of the experiment showed an increase in frustration when playing games generated through PCG versus normal Pac-Man games. Frustration was not shown to decrease over time, and the main PCG parameters that affected frustration in players were the movement speed of the player controlled character, the inclusion of dead ends in the maze generation process and the duration of the game's powerups."

The verification engine operates on programs in the language OOX, which is one of the first intermediate verification languages with support for inheritance. 
    
    In the experiments we show that there is an exponential explosion in verification runtime as the number of subtypes of a symbolic object increase in a datastructure.
    With the aim to improve on this we have implemented an initial heuristic approach to reduce the path explosion problem, by selecting paths with a criterion. We have implemented heuristics based on maximising code coverage, on randomness and a round-robin combination.
    In our evaluation we found that the performance of the heuristic is dependent on the depth of the input program, with our first results showing that the maximising code coverage heuristic is not feasible for smaller programs."

among Dutch adolescents. Additionally, this research
seeks to explore the moderating role of family
functioning in this relationship. Despite the recognition of
family as a crucial context in the lives of adolescents,
limited research has been conducted on its influence on
the association between PSMU and life satisfaction.
Drawing from previous studies, the expectation is that
PSMU and life satisfaction will display a negative
correlation, with family functioning acting as a protective
moderator. Data for this study was collected through a
questionnaire administered to 390 adolescents (54.4%
female) with an mean age of 13.84 (SD = 2.13).
Hypotheses were examined using regression analysis and
process-macro moderation analysis. The results reveal a
significant correlation between PSMU and life satisfaction,
indicating that adolescents displaying more PSMU
characteristics tend to have lower life satisfaction.
However, no moderating effect of family functioning was
observed. Further investigation is recommended to
explore additional factors that may influence the
association between PSMU and life satisfaction, with the
ultimate goal of providing appropriate interventions for
adolescents with PSMU and low levels of life satisfaction."

The research aims to uncover patterns, topics, and insights from the complaints to enhance customer satisfaction strategies.

The problem statement revolves around understanding the impact of dif- ferent natural language processing methods on the comprehension of fi- nancial complaint data and their comparative performance. The key re- search question addresses how various NLP methods influence the under- standing of financial complaint data and how these methods can be compared.

To address this question, the study utilizes four unsupervised learning algorithms: KMeans, LDA, BERTopic, and Hierarchical clustering. KMeans is employed with Word2Vec, Doc2vec, TF-IDF and BERT embeddings, while LDA is applied using Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec repre- sentations. BERTopic with DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering algorithm is also explored with Word2Vec, Doc2vec, TF-IDF and BERT embeddings.

The analysis reveals significant findings, including the identification of key topics in the customer complaints dataset and the comparison of different clustering approaches. The results demonstrate that KMeans with Word2Vec embeddings achieves the highest cluster separation and density, indicating its superior performance. LDA highlights relevant topics related to loans, payments, communication, debt, and banking services. BERTopic with DBSCAN demonstrates improved cluster separation and provides precise and distinctive topics.

In summary, this research provides valuable insights into the understand- ing of financial complaint data using unsupervised learning algorithms. The findings contribute to the development of customer satisfaction im- provement strategies in the banking industry. Last but not least, the study addresses ethical considerations, such as privacy and data integrity, ensuring responsible research practices throughout the analysis."

The study explored two different topic modeling methods, namely LDA and BTM, to assess their effectiveness in uncovering latent topics. By employing these methods, the research aimed to automate the extraction of meaningful themes from the open-ended responses. The data underwent preprocessing, and the models were fine-tuned with optimized parameters. The LDA model failed to provide meaningful insights into the underlying topics. However, the results obtained from the BTM model proved to be highly valuable in extracting latent topics from unstructured and unlabeled text data. The BTM model, which employs biterms to address sparse word co-occurrence in short texts, successfully generated topics with interpretable sets of top words. With some manual adjustments and labeling of these topics, the outcomes can be effectively applied in the analysis of open-ended responses, for example when combined with topic classification and sentiment analysis techniques. This research contributes to the field of topic modeling by highlighting the effectiveness of the BTM model in analyzing unstructured text data from employee engagement surveys.

Moreover, the checking of baggage is partially based on manual detection. While this can be efficient, it is also costly and leaves window open for human error. Therefore, this study aims at optimizing a Faster R-CNN that can accurately detect and classify illegal objects contained in neutron images that were generated from Dynaxion.

Hard-to-find relevant papers if missed can have a significant impact on the outcomes of systematic reviews. The time to discovery (TD) measures how many records are needed to be screened in order to find a relevant paper, making it a useful tool to examine such papers. The main aim of this project was to investigate how AL model and prior knowledge choice influences the TD values of the hard-to find relevant papers and their rank-orders. A simulation study was conducted that consisted of two sets of simulations of the AL-aided screening process on a single dataset. The first set of simulations varied AL model across simulation runs, while keeping prior knowledge constant. The second set of simulations varied prior knowledge, while keeping AL model constant. The results demonstrated that AL model choice significantly influenced the TD values and the rank-order of the TD values of the hard-to-find relevant papers. Notably, the feature extractor had a larger impact on the TD values, as compared to the classifier. While prior knowledge choice did not significantly influence the TD values and the rank-order of the TD values. These findings demonstrate that AL model choice influences the difficulty of finding hard-to-find relevant papers, and that this should be considered when screening papers using an AL-aided tool. Furthermore, this paper highlights the use of the TD metric to examine the variation in the difficulty of finding relevant papers across different simulation setups. Future research should examine the characteristics of hard-to-find relevant papers to discover why they might take a long time to be found, and the effect of AL model choice on the TD values of such papers across multiple datasets in order to determine the generalisability of these findings."

Question Answering has historically been mostly extractive in nature, but in recent years we have seen the paradigm of Natural Language Processing switch towards the more abstract Natural Language Generation approach. We propose a two-step architecture, in which the solution attempts to answers questions from a set of documents with no prior training or fine-tuning. We do not solely focus on Retriever-Reader methods (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa), but also evaluate Retriever-Generator (e.g., GPT, FLAN-T5) systems through Long Form Question Answering. The Amazon Web Services dataset is used as an benchmark for evaluating performance of the zero-shot Open Book Question Answering system. Empirical results are sometimes obtained by splitting the documents in to smaller subsections like paragraphs or passages, therefore we analyse the hyperparameters for document splitting using a sliding window. We show that RoBERTa-large is able to achieve a new State-Of-The-Art F1 score of 59.19 through proper pre-processing of the documents and carefully selecting hyper-parameters, gaining a respectful 18.66 compared to the baseline and 16.99 compared to the best results in the original study. We conclude that generative models and Long Form Question Answering demonstrate great potential, but come with their own set of biases and risks. We observe that when the complexity of the model far exceeds the evaluation metrics, the relevance and meaning of the metrics become questionable. In this context, Semantic Answer Similarity and METEOR prove useful for analyzing diverse model outputs, as they are not dependent on lexical stride like ROUGE, BLEU, F1 and EM. Splitting documents into passages offers performance benefits, although it is important to note that document splitting may not necessarily be superior for all use cases and the optimal hyper parameter values are expected to vary depending on the specific application."

For this reason, this thesis investigated the performance of hybrid heat pumps by searching for human behavioural patterns. The study demonstrates that by making use of predictive modelling, it is possible to forecast power usage trends. By doing so,we produced residuals with reduced influence of temperature, thereby enabling us to use Fourier analysis to look for human behavioural patterns.
Although we found patterns that yielded indications, we could not give conclusive evidence that we found human behavioural patterns. However, we observed differences in how different heat pumps behaved under
similar conditions. These findings suggest that hybrid heat pumps may not be suitable for every house included in this study. Further investigation is necessary to prove if our findings were signs of human behavioural

imputation where possible, and see if this makes a difference. This thesis will focus on errors in public transport activity types found in Google Semantic Location History.
A Python script will check if different parts of the data meet set requirements to locate the quality issues. This script will count the number of errors and use data imputation where possible, resulting in a more accurate

This research focuses on comparing two methods of predicting the sign of the links. The first method utilizes feature engineering approach, where node and graph specific characteristics are extracted and fed as an input to the gradient boosting model. The second method utilizes Signed Graph Convolutional Network, which focuses on extracting node representations in a low dimensional space, which are used to predict a sign of the link. In the end both methods were compared on the left out test set of randomly chosen edges using accuracy, AUC score, precision and recall. The whole experiment was carried out on the publicly available dataset, which is commonly used as the benchmark for signed network algorithms. The final scores obtained by the models were of high quality. However, the performance differ significantly among tested classes, with positive edges being more easier to predict for the models than the negative ones."

Deelmobiliteit in Apeldoorn: Omnisport hub als beginpunt,"['Lam, Niels']","['Ettema, Dick']",2023-08-18T00:01:09Z,NL,"['Deelmobiliteit, mobiliteitshub, Apeldoorn, Shared mobility, Mobility hub']",Human Geography,"In de afgelopen jaren is deelmobiliteit steeds bekender geworden. Meer mensen maken de overstap van bezit naar toegang tot vervoersmiddelen. Deelmobiliteit heeft vele voordelen zoals meer duurzaam reisgedrag, minder afhankelijkheid van de auto en er komt ruimte vrij in de openbare ruimte. Een van de koplopergemeenten in Nederland is Apeldoorn waar 6% van de gemaakte reizen in 2021 werden gedaan met een vorm van deelvervoer. In de toekomst zet de gemeente verder in op deelvervoer in combinatie met de komst van mobiliteitshubs om de voertuigen te stallen. Deze mobiliteitshubs faciliteren een overstap naar deelvervoer, maar er zijn ook voorzieningen aanwezig zoals laadpalen voor elektriciteit of een koffiecorner. Het is daarmee een plek waar personen, voertuigen, faciliteiten en energie bij elkaar worden gebracht.  Een van de aangewezen plekken voor een mobiliteitshub is bij Omnisport op de Voorwaarts. In dit onderzoek is gekeken naar de bereidheid van omwonenden om gebruik te maken van de mobiliteitshub en hoe deze hub bij Omnisport ontworpen zou moeten worden. 
	De resultaten zijn verkregen met een gemengde methode benadering van enquêtes bij omwonenden (n = 364) en interviews met actoren uit het gebied (n = 6). In de enquête is gekeken naar de bereidheid om gebruik te maken van deelvervoer en de mobiliteitshub. Hieruit bleek dat 27,5% positief is in hun houding om deelmobiliteit te gaan gebruiken, terwijl 22% nog twijfelt. Het hebben van medium tot goede digitale vaardigheden, het privé bezit van een fiets en het hebben van een kleiner huishouden zijn allen belangrijke indicatoren om dat iemand meer bereid is om gebruik te maken van deelmobiliteit. Potentiële gebruikers zijn vooral geïnteresseerd in deelauto’s. Voor de mobiliteitshub was 16,7% positief gestemd en 42,6% was misschien bereid om er gebruik van te maken. Het hebben van geen eigen auto, een kortere afstand tot de hoofdwegen van de hub, een kortere afstand tussen het centrum en de hub en een goede infrastructuur voor wandelen en fietsen werden elk gezien als een belangrijke indicator dat de hub vaker gebruikt zal gaan worden. Verder ziet ruim de helft de locatie bij Omnisport als een goede mogelijkheid voor de mobiliteitshub. Daarnaast wil ruim de helft in de toekomst gebruik gaan maken van de faciliteiten die de hub biedt.
	De actoren zijn positief over de meerwaarde die deelmobiliteit heeft maar twijfelen nog in hoeverre dit ook geldt voor hun bedrijf of organisatie. Ook voor de mobiliteitshub zijn nog niet alle actoren volledig overtuigd. Vooral de piekdrukte op het terrein, wanneer alle parkeerplekken vol staan, wordt als een obstakel gezien. Verder waren de actoren het er over eens dat voorzieningen zoals een koffiecorner, toilet en laadpalen voor privé voertuigen belangrijke eisen voor de hub zijn. 
	De ideale plek voor de mobiliteitshub zal op P3 zijn waarbij er een gebouw komt om de voorzieningen een plek te bieden op de hub zelf. Op deze manier kan de vraag van de omwonenden naar deelmobiliteit gefaciliteerd worden. Daarnaast zullen de faciliteiten helpen om de hub te laten slagen."
Cyclists are the happiest commuters: what about e-bikers?,"['Frederik, Ruben']","['Ettema, Dick']",2023-08-18T00:01:12Z,EN,['commute satisfaction; e-biker; cycling; mobility survey'],Human Geography,"This thesis investigates whether there is a difference in trip satisfaction between regular cyclists and e-bikers. The electric bicycle (e-bike) has experienced a rapid increase in the last years (Plazier et al., 2017). In the Netherlands, 40% of the sold bicycles were e-bikes in 2018 (de Haas et al., 2022). It is widely studied and concluded that commuters who cycle are the most satisfied with their trip. There are multiple reasons why this group is the most satisfied. There has been a lot of research on the e-bike, but it isn’t clear what the position of the e- bike is in the list of happiest commuters. Especially in contrast to the regular bicycle. It is important to understand these levels of satisfaction between the two types of bicycles because it can help to encourage the use of the e-bike over the use of the car (St-Louis et al., 2014). It is also important to get to know the advantages of e-biking to get to know the mental health advantages, rather than only the physical health advantages. The research question that is answered in this thesis is: “Do e-bike users have a higher trip satisfaction on their ride to and from the different locations of the Utrecht University compared to regular bicycle users?”

Data from the three-yearly mobility survey that was held at the Utrecht University (UU) has been made available for this research. This survey provides a detailed view on mobility opinions and commuting habits of a lot of students, PhD students, and staff members. The satisfaction with Travel Scale (STS) by Ettema et al. (2011) was used to gauge participants' satisfaction with their commutes. The STS consists of nine different items that respondents could answer with a rating between -4 and 4. These nine items are then grouped into three new scales: positive deactivation, positive activation, and cognitive evaluation. Each respondent's satisfaction with travel scores were created by averaging their responses to each of the three subscales. After that, each respondent's individual satisfaction with travel score was created by averaging their responses to all nine items into the new dependent variable STS total. This means that there have been created four multiple linear regression models. The statistics program SPSS was used for these analyses.

In three of the four different regression models, the change in R-square is very small when the variable ‘mode’ is added. This means that mode choice (riding a regular bicycle or an e- bike) doesn’t have a significant influence on the commuter trip satisfaction (STS score). Only in the cognitive evaluation the independent variable ‘mode’ is significant. In this model it means that the regular bicycle group experiences their commute as less easy and less comfortable than the e-biker group. Control variable ‘age’ seems to have an influence on trip satisfaction in all four models. It seems that the older the people are, the higher the trip satisfaction. The answer to the research question sounds as follows: “E-bikers only experience a significant higher trip satisfaction than regular cyclists in the cognitive evaluation model. This means that e-bikers are more satisfied in terms of easy use and comfort. In the other three models, there doesn’t seem to be a significant difference between the two groups."""
Therapeutic Potential of Milk-derived Extracellular Vesicles as Drug Delivery System,"['Boogaard, Bart']","['Herwijnen, Martijn van']",2023-08-18T00:01:14Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"drug delivery in a multitude of disease models. mEVs present in milk are derived from mammary cells and are hypothesized to comprise exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. mEVs effectively deliver their content, consisting of different biological components, including protein, RNA, and lipids, to recipient cells. The function of mEVs is dependent on their exact content, but several beneficial effects have been attributed to mEVs, including immunoregulatory and anti-tumour effects. This, in combination with the delivery potential of mEVs, makes them a suitable candidate for the development of novel delivery systems for therapeutics. Moreover, mEVs have been found to resist degradation in the gastro-intestinal tract and blood circulation, hinting towards the possibility of oral and intravenous administration. These properties seem to persist cross-species, meaning that mEVs can be derived from a cost-effective and widely available source in the form of bovine milk. In addition, it has been shown that modification of mEV lipid bilayers enables specific targeting of disease tissue, adding to the therapeutic potential of mEVs. Although the development of mEV drug carriers is promising, considerations need to be made before therapeutic applications can be realised. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on mEV characteristics in relation to their potential as drug delivery systems and to discuss practical considerations in the process of developing such a system. To this end, the current methods for isolation and drug loading were evaluated and coupled to the biodistribution of mEVs. Finally, recent developments in mEV therapies for cancer and other diseases were discussed, as well as considerations for future perspectives. It was concluded that improvements in scalability and standardisation of isolation and characterisation methods need to made in order for clinical application to be realised. Moreover, mEV functions, their mechanism of action, and biodistribution need to be elucidated for the development of a safe drug delivery system. Lastly, methods used in industrial processing, isolation, loading, and administration can reduce mEV integrity, but further in vivo studies are required to determine the degree of reduction in functionality."
"Overtwisted (2,3,5)-structures and the h-principle","['Haar, Floor ter']","['Pino Gomez, A. del']",2023-08-18T00:01:40Z,EN,"['differential topology; h-principle; (2,3,5)-structures; distributions; overtwistedness; contact structures; Engel structures']",Mathematical Sciences,"A smooth distribution is a smooth subbundle of the tangent bundle. Locally, smooth distributions are spanned by vector fields to which one can apply the Lie bracket. Intuitively, one can view a distribution as the ``allowed directions of motion’’, and the Lie bracket as a way of measuring whether at a point one can move in a direction by moving along the distribution. If we can move in any direction, we call a distribution bracket-generating. This thesis focusses on bracket-generating distributions called (2,3,5)-structures. These are maximally non-integrable 2-distributions on 5-manifolds. 

The h-principle is a useful tool for classifying families of distributions up to homotopy. In 1969 Gromov proved a powerful result which shows that the h-principle holds for many types of (bracket-generating) distributions, on open manifolds. Therefore, a natural question to ask is, what about closed manifolds? In this thesis we define a special class of (2,3,5)-structures called overtwisted (2,3,5)-structures, and we prove that the h-principle holds for this family of distributions on closed manifolds."

Prior research has operationalized trust as three distinct components (trust, distrust, mistrust) related to different attitudes and behaviors. Based on this distinction, we examined the extent to which conspiracy thinking is correlated to each component of trust and accounts for its variance. Moreover, as trust in an actor can be determined by the assessment of both his intentions and his performance, we investigated the extent to which conspiracy theories influence citizens’ opinions about specific aspects (competence, benevolence, integrity) of government performance and account for their variances.  Results from our online survey (N=404) showed that conspiracy thinking was negatively correlated with trust and positively correlated to distrust and mistrust. Furthermore, conspiracy thinking was negatively correlated with all the aspects of government performance. In addition, the results showed that conspiracy thinking accounted for more than the control variable of skepticism, of the variance in distrust (20%) and mistrust (27%). Regarding performance, skepticism accounted for more than conspiracy thinking overall. Finally, as conspiracy thinking and skepticism combined account for less than 50% of the variance in the trust components and less than 20% of the variance in the government performance, future research should investigate which factors account for the remaining variances and therefore design interventions that would target the different components of trust, performance, and accounting factors."
Exploring the Impact of Perceived Social Status in Role-Reversed Heterosexual Relationships on Women's Ambition in Masculine Occupations: The Role of Partner Support,"['Czine, Fruzsi']","['Vink, Melissa']",2023-08-24T00:01:36Z,EN,"['perceived social status, role-reversed relationship, women in masculine occupations, spousal support']","Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Women within a role-reversed relationship whose status exceeds their partners and who are pursuing masculine occupations experience a lot of career barriers. The purpose of the study was the examine the impact of social status on women's career ambition who are pursuing a masculine occupation and to understand how emotional spousal support plays a role in this relationship. This was important due to the lack of research on at-home dynamics related to the career ambition of women. In total, 182 participants were used, with an age ranging from 18 to 66. As expected, social status was positively associated with a career ambition to pursue a masculine occupation. Furthermore, in line with the expectations, spousal emotional support was positively associated with career ambition. This means that women whose status exceeds their partners and who are ambitious to pursue a masculine occupation can benefit from spousal emotional support. Further research should examine the effects of age and level of education as these variables might have an underlying impact on career ambition because they showed a significant correlation with it. Practical implications are that couples should emphasize emotional spousal support. Support programs could also enhance the awareness of spousal support and provide women with further resources in battling career barriers. Finally, the research should be carried out on an ethnically diverse sample, as the results might differ culturally."
"Nourishing Resistance: An analysis of the biopolitics of food systems in Brooklyn, New York","['Weeber, Guusje']","['Haagsma, J.B.']",2023-08-24T00:01:51Z,EN,['biopolitics; corporate food regime; food sovereignty; food insecurity; Brooklyn'],Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship,"This thesis investigates food insecurity in Brooklyn, New York, and its connection to the conceptual frameworks of the corporate food regime and Michel Foucault’s notion of biopolitics (Kelly 2013; Nally 2011). Biopolitics refers to the mechanisms through which power operates in the lives of the population through knowledge production and the establishment of social norms. Under the neoliberal state, biopolitics is materialized in the normalization of individualism, the consumption of processed food, and a disconnection between urban citizens and food production. In the context of Brooklyn, the biopolitics of the corporate food regime obstruct the population’s access to adequate and nutritious food – but also fosters resistance. According to Foucault, however, all resistance is embedded in the power relations it is combatting (Kelly 2013). This thesis will thus examine how biopolitics is contested, reinforced, and escaped by the food movement and those who are food insecure. Through participant observation, interviewing, and comprehensive analysis, this research uncovers both the overt and covert acts of resistance as well as the acts that inadvertently consolidate the market logic of the corporate food regime. It delves into the education programs, the creation of alternative knowledge, and the sense of community of a food aid organization as well as into the structures that still undermine the food sovereignty it is cultivating in its community. By evaluating biopolitics as a useful yet limited tool to analyze these practices, this research contributes to a nuanced understanding of the possibilities for transformative change within the realm of food insecurity."
ADHD as a predictor for Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction in women with angina,"['Brinkman, Micha']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-08-25T00:00:44Z,EN,['Women; vrouwen; vrouwenhart; ADHD; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; CMD; coronary microvascular dysfunction'],Geneeskunde,"Background
There is increasing knowledge regarding differences in cardiovascular health between men and women. In Europe and the Unites States in women with angina, two thirds do not have obstructive coronary artery disease. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is underdiagnosed in women and tends to persist during adulthood. This study hypothesized that through the activated state of the nervous system in ADHD patients, this could lead to endothelial dysfunction causing women with ADHD to be prone to develop coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD).

Methods
In total 635 female patients aged 18 years and older met inclusion criteria. A total of 625 female patients filled out the ultra-short questionnaire for ADHD completely. Patients with stable angina were categorized into functional (CMD), obstructive coronary arteries or a combination of both. A logistical analysis was preformed to determine whether ADHD was a predictor for CMD in female patients with angina.

Results
CMD was diagnosed in 136 of the 625 included patients. ADHD was diagnosed in 40 (29.4%) patients with CMD and 181 (37%) in the control group. At baseline ADHD did not significantly differ between the two groups (p=0.101). In logistical analysis, ADHD was not a significant predictor for CMD both as an individual predictor (p=0.247) and after entering with cardiovascular risk factors (p=0.416).

Conclusion
ADHD was observed not to be a significant predictor of CMD despite the high prevalence of ADHD (29.4%) compared to the general population. This higher prevalence highlights the importance of screening for ADHD in female patients with angina to optimize care and treatment."

While research has been done to evaluate this in the areas of labour standards, taxation and environmental regulation, no studies have attempted to empirically evaluate this in the area of social expenditure. Rather than a “race to the bottom”, this research paper investigates the prospect of social expenditure competition in Latin America. Using a panel of 20 Latin American countries between 2000 and 2020, this study attempts to quantitatively evaluate the existence of a relationship between government expenditures on health, education and social protection between countries. Using dynamic panel estimation, this research finds no substantial quantitative evidence that social expenditure competition exists between Latin American countries. Additionally, it substantiates the work of previous scholars in finding that institutional and macroeconomic factors may predict social expenditure more consistently than social expenditure in other countries. The paper recommends that similar quantitative analyses be conducted in other regions to verify this, and that more quality data be collected and circulated to facilitate further research."
Finding the Voronoi diagram that most resembles a given subdivision of the plane algorithmically,"['Dorrestijn, Floris']","['Kreveld, Marc van']",2023-08-24T00:01:31Z,EN,[],Computing Science,"In this thesis we propose two algorithms that improve the similarity between a Voronoi cell and a simple polygon. The similarity measures used by these algorithms are the Hausdorff distance and the area of symmetric difference. The algorithm for the Hausdorff distance finds an optimal position in polynomial time. The running time of this algorithm depends on the number of sites, the number of vertices of the simple polygon, an arbitrarily chosen parameter ϵ > 0, and the number of neighbours of our site in several regions. These regions are regions where the set of neighbours of a site (when we change its location in this region) remain the same. The algorithm for the area of symmetric difference returns a position that is a factor (1 + ϵ') within the optimum in polynomial time for any ϵ' ∈ (0, 1). The running time of this algorithm depends on the same factors as the previous algorithm in addition to ϵ'. These algorithms can be used to improve the similarity between a Voronoi diagram and a tessellation iteratively, and we present an idea how to do so."

A reliable feature extractor is needed to capture psychological, structural, and content dimensions in Dutch narrative identity data.

Improving the effectiveness of different Automatic Speech Recognition models with hyperparameter tuning,"['Acosta, Christian']","['Karnstedt-Hulpus, I.R.']",2023-09-06T09:40:36Z,EN,['Automatic Speech Recognition; Speech to Text; Whisper'],Applied Data Science,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown great progress in recent years. Whisper is one of the latest models, showing state-of-the-art performance on a broad range of unseen datasets. This makes it a useful model for a broad range of applications, such as converting audio files into text transcripts.
Detectives of the National Police Corps have a large amount of audio data to process for their investigations. Manual processing is tedious and resource intensive. Whisper can be a useful tool for speeding up investigations and alleviating the workload. While Whisper performs well out-of-the-box, its performance can still be further improved. Through the method of hyperparameter tuning and comparing different implementations of Whisper, the processing time, memory usage, and accuracy have been optimized.
Firstly, we show that reducing computational precision improved the performance in all models tested. Secondly, reducing beam size to a more greedy strategy reduced processing time and memory usage with minimal influence on accuracy. Thirdly, larger batch sizes decreased processing time and increased accuracy, but also increased memory usage. Lastly, implementing Voice Activity Detection increased accuracy and decreased processing time without increasing memory usage. 
We conclude that Faster-Whisper is the overall best performing model for the current use-case. It has the best trade-off between processing time, memory usage, and accuracy. Consequently, this allows for the greatest transcription throughput when multiple instances of the model are used in parallel."

measure abstract psychological constructs. It is therefore important to have a
well fitting CFA model on empirical data-sets. It turns out that in practice many
theoretical models don’t fit the empirical data well which could potentially be
resolved by model re-specification. Research on the topic has led to the use of
meta-heuristics for this task. Numerous meta-heuristics have been proposed for
model specification. From previous research the most promising meta-heuristics
seem to be the Particle Swarm Optimisation and the Genetic Algorithm. The
final goal is to be able to automate the process of model specification.
In this thesis we investigate which set of parameters in the objective functions (hyperparameters) for each of the named metaheuristics yield the best
result for model specification according to certain fit-measures (CFI, RMSEA,
SRMR) that are specific to Structural Equation Models. From the analysis of
the selected data-sets from the OSF-website we conclude that having the modelcomplexity penalty term, λ, in the objective-function in the range of [0, 0.2] will
lead to descent results. For the slope-parameter we find that values beyond a
threshold −b < −100 give the better values for the fit-measures. The threshold values/centring values c1, c2, c3 seem to have a less significant impact on
the resulting fit-measures. None of these conclusions should be interpreted as
hard cut-off values but rather suggestions for avoiding bad performance of the
algorithms in the context of CFA. We also gathered evidence that the Genetic
Algorithm is consistently performing better than the Particle Swarm Optimisation on the selected data-sets while taking up less computing time, suggesting

Equation Modeling (SEM) to enhance model identification and hyperparameter adjustment. The objective 
function in the PSO-SEM algorithm combines various fit measures and considers the trade-off between 
model complexity and fit. For this analysis two datasets that provide different model complexity are 
employed. These datasets undergo similar preprocessing steps, including handling missing data and 
partitioning into training and validation sets. The PSO-SEM algorithm is applied to optimize the model 
fit, and the performance of the final models is evaluated using the validation sets. Through the exploration 
of different hyperparameter combinations and values, valuable insights are obtained regarding their 
relative importance and optimal settings. Additionally, the transferability of the selected hyperparameters 
across different datasets is assessed, and further testing and refinement are conducted to ensure their 
applicability in diverse contexts. The integration of PSO with SEM offers a flexible and efficient 
approach for addressing complex problems and uncovering latent relationships in data, while the 
computational time can be adjusted in each problem, by appropriately tuning parameters such as the 
number of iterations while sacrificing a certain degree of the accuracy. Generally, this research 
contributes to the fields of metaheuristics and structural equation modeling by exploring the integration of 
PSO with SEM for enhanced model identification and hyperparameter adjustment. The findings offer 
valuable insights and practical implications for researchers engaged in solving complex problems and

Improving the Automatic Speech Recognition Model Whisper with Voice Activity Detection,"['Dielen, Isa']","['Karnstedt-Hulpus, I.R.']",2023-09-06T10:08:44Z,EN,['Automatic Speech Recognition; ASR; Whisper; Pre-processing; Voice Activity Detection'],Applied Data Science,"The Dutch National Police possesses a substantial amount of audio data, and transcribing these audio files manually for analysis purposes is very labour intensive. That is why the department TROI developed an application that uses Whisper, a state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition model, to automatically transcribe these audio files. Although the accuracy of Whisper is quite high, its execution time is relatively slow, posing a challenge when needing to transcribe large amounts of audio files. Considering Whisper’s minimalist strategy for data pre-processing, it is conceivable that incorporating advanced pre-processing techniques could further optimize its performance in terms of running time, without a considerable comprise in accuracy. Therefore, this research aims to investigate the influence of the pre-processing method voice activity detection on Whisper’s performance. The experiments in this research compare the performance of Whisper, Faster-Whisper and WhisperX on Dutch long-form audio data of two datasets: CGN and NFI-FRITS. Faster-Whisper and WhisperX both incorporate a voice activity detection model, Silero VAD and PyAnnote VAD, respectively. Additional experiments with hyperparameter tuning and testing the voice activity detection models are conducted. The evaluation metrics used in this research are Word Error Rate, precision, recall, F1 score and Real-Time Factor. 

The results demonstrate that both Faster-Whisper and WhisperX outperform the baseline Whisper model. They exhibit improved WER, precision, recall, F1-score, and RTF, indicating the advantages of incorporating voice activity detection models within the Whisper framework. Generally, WhisperX is outperforming Faster-Whisper across the different datasets and settings, on almost all performance metrics. Furthermore, the effects of tuning speech probability thresholds in Faster-Whisper and WhisperX are not clear, as they do not show a specific trend. The comparison between Silero and PyAnnote VAD shows variations in precision and recall, where PyAnnote VAD, as incorporated in WhisperX, is outperforming on precision, and Silero VAD, as incorporated in Faster-Whisper, is outperforming on recall. In conclusion, incorporating a voice activity detection model as a pre-processing technique enhances the performance of Whisper by improving transcription accuracy measured by the Word-Error Rate, precision, recall, and F1-score, and reducing the execution time measured by the Real-Time Factor. However, the effects of tuning the speech probability threshold in Faster-Whisper and WhisperX, are limited. Future research is recommended to examine alternative voice activity detection models, test the memory usage of the models, investigate differences between Whisper implementations, and look into alternative preprocessing techniques."
Unveiling protest-related social networks on Twitter: A comprehensive analysis of topic differences and temporal patterns within protest-related social networks in the Netherlands.,"['Borghardt, Jesse']","['Veltkamp, Remco']",2023-09-06T10:08:28Z,EN,['Protest motivation; Group characteristics; Dutch protests; Social\nnetwork analysis; Twitter; Hashtags'],Business Informatics,"The number of protests in the Netherlands has risen significantly in recent years, posing challenges for the Dutch police to ensure safety during these events. The increasing frequency of unannounced protests and the personnel shortages within the organization further exacerbate the complexities of ensuring public safety during such events. This necessitates research to better comprehend the motivations behind protests and effectively prepare for future events. 
This study addresses this need by utilizing open source Twitter data to perform social network analyses. The research is conducted in three phases: an exploratory phase, a method development phase, and an evaluation phase. In the exploratory phase, the possibilities of using social network analyses within the context of protest-related social networks are investigated. Building on the experiences from this phase, a method called PReSNA is developed for analyzing protest-related social networks. Following the design science research approach, the PReSNA method is then evaluated using a separate data set covering two large protests in March 2023. 
The findings reveal significant differences in hashtag usage prior to protests, providing valuable insights into the possibility to detect topics that can trigger future protests. Moreover, significant differences are observed in the characteristics of groups engaged in protest-related Twitter conversations, shedding light on the factors driving activity within these groups. 
The results of this study demonstrate the value of open source data in gaining insights into protest behavior. Furthermore, these findings highlight the potential for future research within this area. 
Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of protest-related social networks and offers a methodological framework for analyzing such networks. By leveraging open source data and social network analysis techniques, this study provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of protest management."
Quantifying the influence of submesoscale processes on measured transport of floating plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,"['Romero, Mattia']","['Sebille, Erik van']",2023-09-06T10:08:36Z,EN,[],Climate Physics,"The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) is known for accumulating floating plastic, but
little is known on the dominating mechanisms that form its heterogeneity. Submesoscale
processes are likely the main drivers of such heterogeneity, especially if their effect on transport
is object-specific. This hypothesis is investigated by analysing shipboard remote sensing
and metocean data. By developing a Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) methodology,
floating plastic’s velocities are derived from GoPro and drone data collected during The Ocean
Cleanup’s operational and research campaigns. Research findings show that surface currents,
without additional forcings, cannot fully account for more than half of the variance in floating
plastic transport within the North-West region of the GPGP. This suggests that leeway, an
important factor in floating plastic transport, is likely a non-negligible component for most
items in the area, with varying leeway rates observed across the sample. Furthermore, an
analysis on submesoscale accumulation indicates that density fronts may contribute to creating
heterogeneity at smaller scales. Notably, two episodes demonstrate higher floating plastic
accumulation along density fronts than in the surrounding environment. In summary, this
study sheds light on the crucial role of submesoscale processes in shaping the heterogeneity of
the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Understanding these mechanisms can lead to more effective
strategies for mitigating plastic pollution and its environmental impacts."

To counter this trend, one effective approach in science education is to provide relevant, non-formal learning experiences, complementary to formal science education. Such learning experiences can be found at science- and natural history museums. In the Netherlands, there is a large natural history museum at Naturalis Biodiversity Center. Naturalis offers a wide variety of specialized educational programs that engage students in science. However, not much is known about how these programs contribute to fostering positive attitudes towards science in students. Therefore, eight focus groups were conducted with 25 students from grade 8 and 9, who participated in an educational program at Naturalis. Based on students’ reports on three relevant subconstructs of attitudes towards science (perception of the scientist, value of science, and enjoyment of science), five mechanisms are recognized to foster positive attitudes towards science in a museum program: (1) showing diversity in research fields, (2) portraying scientists as people who travel a lot, discover new things, and know a lot, (3) helping students understand more about science, (4) implementing active learning activities, and (5) ensuring an exposure to science through exhibition rooms and objects from the collection. These findings can be used to develop new educational programs, or adapt existing programs, in a way that fosters positive attitudes towards science. Suggestions for implementation and future research are given."
The effect of innovation on unemployment and its evolution - A mixed methods analysis investigating the evolutionary relationship between regional innovation and labour markets within the European Union,"['Nieuwenhuizen, Quentin van']","['Petralia, Sergio']",2023-09-09T00:00:45Z,EN,['Innovation - Labour markets - Local capabilities - Unemployment'],Urban and Economic Geography,"Evolutionary economic geographic literature seeks to place the concept of innovation within a path-dependent context where the complexity and relatedness of activities and knowledge regionally determine a region’s probability of successfully specializing in a new activity. As the spatial fragmentation of innovation increases, research needs to investigate how innovation will affect society. This research seeks to apply the evolutionary perspective of innovation on its effect on regional labour markets. Doing so provides knowledge for policymakers, employers, and employees to deal with challenges and opportunities on the labour market. Scientifically this research further substantiates the legitimacy of this evolutionary perspective whilst combining it with more traditional economic research on labour markets. Through an evolutionary revisitation of Okun’s Law which states that cyclical economic growth is related to labour market developments; this research investigates the relationship between regional innovation and unemployment and its evolution. It does so for the NUTS-2 regions of the European Union and the EEA between 2015 and 2019. Building on data of the European Commission, a quantitative analysis finds that regional innovation and human capital negatively affect unemployment and its evolution. At the same time, regional innovation and human capital also seem to decrease inequality on regional labour markets regarding unemployment. Three case studies have been drafted to investigate what determinants shape these dynamics. The key takeaway of these case studies is that regional context, local capabilities, geography, and labour market policies are key determinants of the relationship between regional innovation and labour markets. However, this research fails to investigate the relationship between regional innovation and the occupational structure of labour markets. Therefore, further research on regional innovation and labour markets is needed."
Analysis of Semi-Lagrangian advection using finite difference methods,"['Adriaens, Michael']","['Frank, Jason']",2023-09-07T23:00:59Z,EN,['Finite difference methods;Semi-Lagrangian methods;advection;weather model;numerical integration;stability;convergence;consistency;CFL-condition;HARMONIE'],Mathematical Sciences,"The advective terms in several numerical weather models have been integrated with Semi-Lagrangian methods for decades. Their stability allows for larger time steps than explicit finite difference methods, while experiencing less dispersion than implicit finite difference methods. In the case of the one dimensional
advection equation, it turns out that for uniform and constant velocity, the Semi-Lagrangian method is equivalent to a shifted finite difference method. The degree of polynomial interpolation determines the truncation of the Taylor series and accuracy of the finite difference approximations. The shift is necessary
to account for arbitrarily large time steps without losing stability as occurs for explicit finite difference methods. For linear interpolation, the integration is guarenteed to be stable for non-uniform and non-constant velocity,  hile higher order interpolation can in theory experience instability. The instabilities occasionally observed in the HARMONIE operational code are a part of the departure point problem. This thesis proves the existence and uniqueness of and convergence to these departure points. In areas with large vertical velocity
gradients, the convergence of fixed point iteration can be too slow, resulting in nonphysical crossing of characteristics and therefore negative model layer heights. This could be the key to finding a criterion to prevent runtime errors occurring and improving reliability of numerical weather prediction."

The research itself is implemented using a literature study, design and experiments and feedback from the Dutch Cadastre. The visualization and exploration are tested on data from the current Cadastral Map (Basisregistratie Kadaster, Base Register Kadaster: BRK) and the Cadastral Map next (Kadastrale Kaart Next, KKN) pilot. However, this research focuses more on comparing the difference in the calculated and registered surface area of parcels using the current cadastral map. The visualization challenges include showing changes at individual parcel level and aggregated levels (section, municipality), showing the amount of difference (relative/absolute sizes, acceptable/not acceptable), and the direction of change (smaller, bigger). This change is relevant for many organizations: apart from Dutch Cadastre, also the owners, municipalities, water boards and provinces, as a change in the area may imply a change in value and change in taxation.
  
The current results show a significant preliminary difference in the area difference between parcels in rural and built-up areas in the Netherlands. Furthermore, clusters of parcels with the largest difference can be found in the natural areas of the Netherlands, which exceed the limits set by the Dutch cadastre. Furthermore, new-urban and agricultural areas show a high correlation between the registered and the calculated surface area of parcels. Lastly, the KKN pilot shows that there is a possibility of significant changes in the parcel area when the 6th Cadastral Map is implemented."
Elucidation of the Working Mechanism of Lipiodol on Healthy and Endometriotic Endometrium,"['Rijssemus, Hanneke']","['Veersema, Bas']",2023-09-07T23:00:55Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"Endometriosis is a complex syndrome strongly associated with infertility. Lipiodol is a contrast medium used for hysterosalpingography, which has been shown to increase fertility in women with endometriosis. However, the mechanism of this is unknown. Recently, it was shown lipiodol treatment can affect endometrial gene expression. In a study by Johnson et al, twelve genes that play a role in in endometriosis, implantation, or inflammation were found to be significantly up or downregulated. A pilot study by our own group with endometrial receptivity markers showed lipiodol might also affect expression of four of these markers. Additionally, lipiodol has been shown to affect the number and activity of uterine immune cells. We aim to elucidate the mechanism of lipiodol on healthy and endometriotic endometrium, with a focus on the mentioned biomarkers. In vitro, we will test the effect of lipiodol on the expression of the biomarkers in endometrial cell lines and patient-derived organoids, determine the role and amount of iodine uptake from lipiodol, test the effect of lipiodol the role of the inflammation-related biomarkers in this on natural killer cells and test the effect of lipiodol and the role of the implantation-related biomarkers on blastocyst adhesion and invasion. In a clinical trial, we will perform pre- and post-lipiodol endometrial biopsies and measure pregnancy rates, change in biomarker levels, uterine and circulating immune cell number and cytotoxicity, hormone levels, and iodine levels. Together, this will allow us to clarify the mechanism of lipiodol in endometriosis."

defenses. However, within this region, numerous flood-prone areas exist outside the dikes (UFPAs), 
where many people live and work. With rising sea levels and increased river discharges due to climate 
change, these vulnerable UFPAs are frequently affected by flooding, leading to substantial damage. This 
anticipated damage is closely connected to the closure policy of the Maeslant barrier, underscoring the 
significance of UFPAs in terms of the barrier's functioning and potential replacement. Consequently, 
reducing damage in the UFPAs holds relevance in discussions concerning the Maeslant barrier’s 
lifespan.

This thesis centers on the UFPAs of Dordrecht, which stand out due to their high economic and 
historical value. No specific research has previously investigated or calculated into a local measure to 
protect the UFPAs by implementing a new primary flood defense. Associated costs, benefits and local 
effects of possible implementations have also never been investigated before. Therefore, this research 
aims to develop a technically suitable, legally feasible, economically affordable and socially accepted 
solution for the UFPAs of Dordrecht to reduce the impacts of flooding, summarized in a cost-benefit 
analysis (CBA).

This CBA adheres to standard guidelines while incorporating a range of supplementary methodologies 
to address technical aspects. The reference scenario assumes the absence of any new flood barrier. Six
alternatives were formulated and compared to the reference situation, evaluating their effects, costs, 
and benefits. Six effects were identified to assess benefits: recreational boating, shipping, house prices, 
water storage capacity, retail, and (avoided) flood damage (both material and immaterial). While the 
first five effects were qualitatively described, the last one was quantified and monetized. Various 
required investments and related operation and maintenance costs were assessed. All absolute costs 
and benefits were discounted per alternative to determine their present value. Subsequently, net 
present values were computed to establish the CBA balances for each alternative, determining whether 
the benefits would outweigh the costs. Unanimously, alternative 3A exhibited the highest net benefits 
from the CBA and various sensitivity analyses, thus being the preferred alternative for future flood 
protection in Dordrecht. This alternative entails float barriers (rising quay walls), no storm surge barrier, 
supplemented by several lift barriers in the canals. Conducting similar follow-up research in other 
vulnerable UFPAs in the Rhine Estuary-Drechtsteden region or elsewhere would be highly relevant and 
interesting, providing insights into whether local small-scale solutions might outperform large-scale 
adaptations."

face in the employment of practices in their actual classrooms. The findings indicate that 
while many teachers uphold a positive attitude towards multicultural education and adopt 
inclusive teaching practices, there is room for improvement in explicitly including cultural

The current application of Visual Scanning Training (VST) is far from optimized and a large variability in patients’ benefits exists. Moreover, it remains unclear what the effect of VST is on neglect in daily life activities (ADL).  It is hypothesized that VST outcomes might be associated with severity of neglect. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether neglect severity at baseline is predictive of VST effects on ADL in chronic stroke patients with leftsided visuospatial neglect. In addition, we examined the relationship between severity of allocentric and egocentric neglect on conventional tasks and in ADL and investigated how severity of neglect on conventional tasks and in ADL changes over the course of VST. To this end, chronic stroke patients with leftsided visuospatial neglect received 40 minutes of VST for 18 sessions. The Schenkenberg Line Bisection and McIntosh Line Bisection task were used to assess allocentric neglect, the Star Cancellation task to assess egocentric neglect, the Catherine Bergego Scale was used to assess neglect in ADL. 21 chronic stroke patients participated in this study. We showed no significant relation between allocentric and egocentric neglect on conventional tasks and in ADL. VST significantly ameliorates allocentric neglect measured with a paper-and-pencil task (Schenkenberg Line Bisection), which generalizes to improvements in neglect in ADL. Severity of neglect was no significant predictor of the effect of VST on improvement in neglect in ADL."
Critical community energy initiatives in the Netherlands: characteristics and support,"['Gieteling, Art']","['Peine, Alex']",2023-09-18T07:01:02Z,EN,[],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Energy systems worldwide are undergoing transitions to reduce their contribution to climate change.  This includes the modest rise of energy prosumption (EP), whereby small energy consumers individually and collectively challenge existing energy business models by producing, saving, storing, and selling of renewable energy themselves. EP could empower citizens and communities to govern their own energy systems and thousands of community energy (CE) initiatives in Europe are attempting to do so locally. For these still small EP and CE niches and their key benefits to become part of the socio-technical energy system, stretch-and-transform processes are required to change the regime’s selection criteria. To better understand the influence of CE actors in bringing about policy changes, literature introduced the novel Critical niches (CN) perspective to complement the perspectives of Strategic niche management (SNM) and Niche policy advocacy (NPA). This research aimed to identify and study the most critically outspoken CE initiatives in the Netherlands, to better understand their role from a CN perspective in dimensions of Local experiments, Knowledge priorities, Niche intermediation, and Politics. Critically outspoken CE initiatives were selected by researching websites of over 500 Dutch CE initiatives. Relevant data was collected through semi-structured interviews with representatives of 12 identified CE initiatives. Results show that the studied CE initiatives do show some potential regarding Local experiments and Knowledge priorities. However, for Niche intermediation, they are not supported nor encouraged in taking on a critical role: their umbrella organizations appear to align to the NPA perspective and seem to discourage their members to take a more critical role. Moreover, regarding Politics, the initiatives themselves also have a clear preference for the NPA way of conducting themselves: they rather keep talking in good standing with policymakers, instead of being more critically outspoken or even publicly protest policies that hinder them. About half of the studied CE initiatives have certain ambitious goals that would require stretch-and-transform processes to be achieved. The CN perspective is especially of interest such ambitious CE initiatives to rethink their NPA approach. This research concludes that critical CE initiatives may not be found between CE cooperatives and suggests future research to study other types of CE initiatives from a CN perspective."
Generational differences in general attitudes towards AI and the level of trust in artificial faces,"['Heezen, Sophie']","['Hortensius, Ruud']",2023-09-18T07:00:52Z,EN,['AI; Artificial intelligence; trust; age; face perception; GAAIS; regulatory focus; RFQ; social psychology'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","With the increase of artificial intelligence in modern society, more people must now cooperate and interact with these systems. Cooperation and interaction with AI are dependent on the level of trust. The level of trust in AI is shaped by experiences over time. Whereas younger generations have grown up in a time where AI technologies were already increasingly prevalent and integrated into their daily lives, older generations had to adjust to the idea of AI. The question arises whether there are generational differences in the level of trust in AI. This study investigates whether the level of trust in AI is different for people from different generations. We compare two age groups on the level of trust in faces labelled as computer-generated and the level of trust in faces labelled as natural. The level of trust in faces labelled as computer- generated, was used to measure trust in AI. Additionally, we measured whether general attitudes towards AI and levels of generalized trust were different for people in the different age groups. This research expands existing knowledge on this topic by including the influence of individuals’ self-regulation on the level of trust in AI. As expected, we found that faces labelled as computer-generated were perceived as less trustworthy compared to faces labelled as natural. However, no significant differences were found between the two age groups in the general attitudes towards AI, and general attitudes did not predict trust in AI. Furthermore, no significant differences were found between the two age groups in the level of trust in AI. Finally, individuals’ self-regulation did not influence the relationship between age and the level of trust in AI. Our findings suggest that age alone might not be a strong predictor of trust in AI, as, familiarity, and previous experience with AI may be interconnected factors that influence the level of trust in AI. We recommend that other factors should be taken into consideration when investigating the relationship between age and trust in AI in future research. Furthermore, future research is recommended to include more dynamic tasks and control for potential outgroup effects to further explore the relationship between age, self-regulation, and trust in AI."

Though many students
believe career counselling services provide essential aid for this anxiety, a lack of accessibility or
availability is often attributed as the reasons why a significant proportion of students never avail of such
services. AI poses as an alternative to traditional career guidance and shows great potential to address this
lack of accessibility or availability. Sollicity is aiming to develop their own AI coach to assist students in
a new and easily accessible manner. This project aims to help Sollicity better understand their student
aptitude test data through implementing cluster analysis in an effort to develop generalized profiles to
allow for improved career path recommendations by the AI coach. Minimisation of cost to Sollicity in the
operation of the AI coach can be performed through dimension reduction techniques to reduce the
necessary questions needing to be asked to guide a student to their desired career path. Another aim of
this project is to validate the use of principal component analysis (PCA) techniques to infer if this is a
viable method for Sollicity to employ in this effort of cost minimisation. The cluster analysis results
reveal a consistent 2-cluster solution representing the students that completed the aptitude tests. Question
minimization through cumulative variance PCA methods is found to preserve the cluster structure of the
data well. The simplistic 2-cluster findings are unlikely to provide reliable generalized profiles for
Sollicity’s AI coach. A significant data reduction due to many incomplete tests is likely the cause of such
cluster findings. Future research should consider the implementation of alternative clustering algorithms
in conjunction with or as alternatives to the ones implemented in this thesis to provide more
comprehensive results."

The study focuses on the Val Grande National Park in northern Italy as the study area. The Landsat 8 satellite imagery is used to assess NDVI trends over specific time intervals, including monthly trends and 16-day moving windows.
The results suggest potential shifts in the timing of the growing season based on the analysis of monthly and moving window trends. October exhibits pronounced changes, with vibrant green and red colors indicating increased NDVI values and improved vegetation health. These findings suggest a possible extension of the growing season into October. However, various factors, such as species composition and local environmental conditions, may contribute to these observed changes. Further research is needed to establish definitive trends and understand the underlying factors driving these shifts."

‘Evaluation of the ‘renewed approach to delirium’ project at the cardiothoracic surgery ward.’,"['Polat, Pelin']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-09-24T23:00:56Z,EN,"['POD, post operative delirium, cardiac surgery, implementation, DOSS, DeltaScan']",Geneeskunde,"Introduction. Postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery is a common but frequently unrecognized complication in hospitalized patients, typically occurring within the first three postoperative days. This study evaluates the implementation of the quality improvement project ‘renewed approach to delirium’ initiated in June 2022 at the Cardiothoracic Surgery Department in Catharina Hospital Eindhoven. The project aimed to improve the identification and management of postoperative delirium in cardiac surgery patients. Methods. We used a mixed-methods study design with a primary quantitative phase, including semi-structured interviews for the evaluation of the project. The study included high-risk patients of postoperative delirium, analyzed from July 2022 to May 2023. We retrieved the number of VMS, DOSS, and DeltaScan measurements to assess the adherence to the project.
Results. We analyzed 156 patients (mean age 72.4 years). Preoperative VMS was performed in nearly all patients (98.1%), of which 11.5% showed an increased risk of delirium. The total number of adequate measurements was 7.7% and 39.7% for the DOSS and DeltaScan, respectively. Additionally, there is an increasing trend in the number of measurements.
Discussion. Our findings indicate suboptimal adherence to the quality improvement project. Challenges include a lack of understanding, time constraints, and issues related to acceptability and adoption. Inadequate adherence may compromise delirium detection and overall patient care quality, potentially leading to delayed interventions, extended hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and a higher risk of adverse patient outcomes, including persistent cognitive impairment and institutional care needs upon discharge."
Stratospheric dynamics of slowly rotating terrestrial planets,"['Okánik, Martin']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-09-26T00:01:02Z,EN,[],Climate Physics,"With the advent of space travel in 20th century, and discoveries of thousands of exoplanets in the 21st, the field of atmospheric dynamics faces new challenges and opportunities. Of particular interest is qualitative understanding of how the astronomical, physical and chemical parameters of terrestrial planets influence their general circulation, whose nature can bridge the gap between a potentially habitable planet and a habitable one. Previous research used idealized GCMs to study the tropospheres of planets with smooth surface and an Earth-like set of bulk properties, one of which was varied at a time. Dependent on the rotation rate, meridional radiative forcing gradient, and the dampling timescale, they identified several qualitatively distinct tropospheric circulation regimes. 

This work aims to be a step towards building similar understanding for layers above the troposphere. The research question is what happens to a stratosphere with a constant radiative forcing similar to a solstice on Earth, when the relative planetary rotation rate $\Omega^*=\Omega/\Omega_{E}$ is lowered. The results indicate a regime transition from a wave-driven circulation for the Earth-like $\Omega^* \sim 1$ to a non-linear regime at $\Omega^*\leq10^{-1}$, with a stronger, radiatively driven Hadley-like cell in the stratosphere. This overturning is an inherently seasonal effect developping because of the downwelling present over the winter pole, and likely enhanced to some extent because of the warmth of the ozone layer in lower latitudes. It is centered around 30 hPa in winter mid-latitudes, and extends all the way to mid-latitudes of the summer hemisphere. A somewhat surprising result is the emergence of superrotation in the stratosphere, separate from the better-known superrotation region near tropopause. This result is less understood, it is hypothesised to be a result of gravity-wave breaking in the upper summer stratosphere, with angular momentum potentially advected across the equator by the Hadley-like cell. More research is needed to properly understand this phenomenon. 

This work also tentatively proposes a suitable parameter space for a more detailed future study. Compared to the troposphere, frictional Taylor number should be replaced with radiative Taylor number, and a further parameter shown to be related to Burger number might be considered."
Oral antihypertensive agents in pregnancy and fetal growth restriction – a population-based cohort study,"['Ling, Martijn van']","['Lely, Titia']",2023-09-24T23:00:59Z,EN,['Antihypertensive agents; Hypertension; Pregnancy; Birth weight; Small for gestational age'],Geneeskunde,"Introduction: Currently, there is no consensus on whether methyldopa, labetalol, or nifedipine is the preferred treatment for hypertension in pregnancy. These agents might have varying effects on fetal growth and the risk for small for gestational age (SGA) birth. Randomised controlled trials lack sufficient power to determine if one of the three agents poses an increased risk regarding this outcome. 

Methods: In this population-based cohort study, automated pharmacy dispensing data (PHARMO) was linked to the Netherlands Perinatal Registry (Perined) for outcomes of pregnancies between 2000-2019. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, we retrospectively assessed the effect of methyldopa, labetalol and nifedipine on the outcome SGA. 

Results: The risk of SGA birth was not significantly different for pregnancies exposed to labetalol compared to methyldopa (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81-1.10, p=0.47). Due to the inclusion of pregnancies where nifedipine was used as a tocolytic agent for threatened preterm delivery, this treatment could only be validly compared with the other two agents in the chronic hypertension subgroup analysis (start of treatment < 20 weeks gestational age). In this subgroup, the risk of SGA birth for nifedipine was comparable to that of methyldopa (aOR=1.11, 95% CI: 0.71–1.68, p=0.22) and labetalol (aOR=1.01, 95% CI: 0.63–1.59, p=0.93). 

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that there is no difference in the risk of SGA birth between methyldopa, labetalol and nifedipine. Large-scale observational studies using other data sources with more elaborate data on covariates and treatment indication are needed for confirmation."

The Effects of Restricting Antimicrobial Use in Food-Producing Animals on Antimicrobial Resistance in Humans: a Review,"['Florschütz, Tim']","['Mughini Gras, Lapo']",2023-09-26T00:00:44Z,EN,"['Antimicrobial use, antimicrobial resistance, food-producing animals, policy change, model']",Epidemiology,"Resistance to antimicrobials is an important and growing concern for human health worldwide, as it reduces the efficacy of antimicrobial treatments, leading to longer illness and increased mortality. Antimicrobial use in food producing animals can increase the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in animals. Subse quently, this resistance can be transmitted to humans through the foodborne pathway. Reducing antimicrobial use in food producing animals could therefore limit resistance in
humans. In light of possible negative effects of reducing antimicrobial use, it is important that the effects of a restriction in antimicrobial usage can be predicted, so a cost benefit analysis can be made to inform policy makers. This review provides an overview of the available research on the effects of restricting antimicrobial use in food producing animals on antimicrobial resistance in humans. A literature search resulted in 14 papers being included, that constructed either a model or analysing a change in policy. All included papers showed a decrease in resistance in humans foll owing a restriction in antimicrobial use, with the exception of one paper where no significant difference was observed for one of the antimicrobials investigated. The effect sizes varied to a large extent between studies, which can be partly ascribed to th e different bacteria and antimicrobials investigated. However, a lack of information on the change in antimicrobial use is a major shortcoming of almost all studies. More research is needed to reliably estimate the impact of restricting antimicrobial use i n food animals on resistance in humans. This future research should also focus on quantifying the change in antimicrobial usage following a restriction."
An eye in the sky: a use-case for evaluating super resolution,"['Bouten, Yannick']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-06-22T13:28:23Z,EN,['super resolution; deep learning; remote sensing; sentinel 2; spot 6; ArcGIS Pro; feature extraction; spatial resolution'],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"The aim of this research was to execute a proof of concept on the added value of deep learning 
methodologies as part of remote sensing analysis. This was done in collaboration with the 
Dutch Ministry of Defence to improve the knowledge on this within the geo-domain. Deep 
learning constituted two different applications as part of this research; super resolution, which 
is to increase the spatial resolution beyond it is original limit (Yue et al., 2022) and feature 
extraction. The latter is also interesting as applying a geo-analysis task on super resolution 
data can prove to be a suitable methodology to evaluate the result and also attributes to the 
increase scientific interest in deep learning within the field of remote sensing (Yang & Newsam, 
2013).

For super resolution models with varying amounts of input data have been tested and the 
metrical evaluation showed no significant issues although the models could be further 
optimised. Augmenting data to increase the usability of a dataset proved promising in 
performance but not conclusive in its added value to modelling super resolution. Visually the 
super resolution models showed more detail in comparison to a Sentinel 2 image of the same 
area but their differences in metrics did not result in apparent visual differences between 
models.

Feature extraction showed that all super resolution models outperformed a Sentinel 2 based 
extraction model in metrics. In comparison to the ground truth road network the model proved 
difficult and below expectation.

The conclusion is therefore that super resolution and deep learning based analysis 
methodologies can be of added value for remote sensing analysis and usable in an accessible 
and application-oriented manner. On an absolute scale however both the evaluation metrics 
and evaluation analysis in the form of road extraction showed that it could definitely benefit 
from further optimization to improve both performance and generalizability of the models. 

The discussion touched upon several aspects of the research that could attribute to this, 
including other types of satellite data, open-source modelling software and alternative analysis 
tasks using super resolution data."
Producing Utopia: Creatively Producing Non-binary Futurity in Queer Art Projects,"['Pijs, Kas']","['Karreman, L.L.']",2023-06-22T13:18:24Z,EN,"['transgender studies, arts and society, non-binary gender, queer futurity, performing arts, creative producing, creative producer, non-binary futurity, utopian performatives, queer methodologies']",Arts and Society,"The central focus of this research is exploring how to hold space for non-binary narratives within the context of creative producing. To answer this question, the study uses the self-formulated queer methodology called Enby-on-Enby, which draws on field research and close reading and is based on Ulrika Dahl’s femme on femme. The researcher is a creative producer involved in two distinct queer art projects, both of which include non-binary narratives: More is More and R3LN4CHT.
	The first of the three chapters is focused on conceptualizing the idea of non-binary futurity within the context of performance art. Non-binary futurity is seen as an ideality that challenges normative gender fixity and embraces the future potential of gender fluidity. The second chapter then analyzes artworks from the two queer art projects, looking for aspects of the works with a utopian aesthetic. This chapter points to elements within the artworks that encourage viewers to reflect on the possibility of alternative embodiments and to imagine a world where gender fluidity is thriving. Finally, the third chapter delves into the producer's efforts to create the right conditions for social spaces that reinforce the utopian potential of the artworks and performances. The chapter understands that More is More and R3LN4CHT have different strategies, but both are based on boundary-pushing connectivity between artists, art, and the audience. However, one project tries to create a safer space for gender non-conforming individuals to participate in art and performance, while the other project seeks to create critical spaces where non-binary and heteronormative perspectives can rub against each other.
	In conclusion, this thesis argues that framing non-binary futurity for the creative producer requires creating conditions that encourage viewers and creators to participate in thinking about alternative possibilities of gender embodiment and to consider the ideal of gender fluidity. By focusing on the non-binary in queer projects and focusing on the practice of the creative producer, the study expands the understanding of the role of the producer in creating inclusive storytelling for the non-binary story."

Using John Fiske’s semiotic analysis and an intersectional approach, this thesis explores how Enid’s gender identity, social class, and sexuality contribute to her monstrous Otherness. The analysis reveals how Enid’s werewolf identity intersects with these other aspects of her identity to create a complex representation of the “monstrous-feminine.” By analysing the visual construction of Enid’s character and examining her gender identity, social class, and sexuality, this thesis offers insights into the usefulness of the concept of “monstrous-feminine” for representing the complex intertwining of gender identity and Otherness in U.S. popular culture. The analysis also contributes to the ongoing discussion of the representation of the female werewolf, highlighting the importance of an intersectional approach to understanding the complexity of identity and its impact on the construction of Otherness in popular culture. It is important to note that the complexity of Enid’s character is not necessarily a positive or negative attribute in itself, but rather a nuanced representation of a female werewolf that challenges simplistic stereotypes of monstrous women."

For this purpose, a dataset of 200 TikTok videos was collected, coded and analysed through a digital methods approach that combines a hashtag and content analysis to study the Formula One community and their grammars of communication on TikTok. Drawing on the data collected and the findings, this research reveals how hashtags contribute to the creation and development of a shared participatory culture among Formula One fans on TikTok, which has led to the emergence of a distinct platform vernacular surrounding the hashtags #f1 and #f1tiktok. Their platform vernacular mainly revolves around Formula One drivers and their creative expressions that incorporate vernacular creativity. This demonstrates how the community facilitates and encourages a remix culture, which is further exemplified through the frequent sharing of content from other platforms (cross-platform sharing) and the creation of fan edits, thirst traps and memes. Additionally, memes, trends and popular hashtags are leveraged by the Formula One community to appeal to the virality-centric logic of the platform and boost their visibility. On the other hand, elements of the vernacular are also adopted by public figure accounts for similar purposes. Consequently, this research underscores the importance of hashtags, and thus a platform’s affordances, in the creation of a shared participatory fan culture. Therefore, these findings contribute to the current academic debate surrounding platforms and the interplay between their affordances and user interactions and forms the foundation for further research on the creation and development of participatory cultures around sports, specifically Formula One."

The framework of regulation by platforms provides insight into how platforms regulate content through their policies. This thesis examines the content policies of the platforms TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter during the Ukraine war through a textual analysis. It is argued that these policies reveal the dual nature of platform values, in which platforms operate as private actors in a public sphere. To illustrate, this study shows the difference in platform values across these platforms, such as safety, authenticity, and freedom of speech. However, these policies reveal that freedom of speech is used to serve the interests of Facebook and Twitter but clashes with the public value of responsibility and accountability. Besides that, the Ukraine war also constructed other public values such as trust and transparency, which interfere with the opaque and ambiguous policy enforcements of these platforms. As a result, it has been shown that during the war in Ukraine, TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter shifted their self-regulatory systems into co-regulatory practices."

In 2020, forensic medical expertise for children with injuries suspicious of physical and/or sexual abuse
was partially shifted from national organisations to regional forensic doctors across the Netherlands. This
paper aims to evaluate what changes these renewed forensic medical injury reports have brought about
in the work of Veilig Thuis and to what extent these injury reports are decisive in the criminal prosecution
of child physical and sexual abuse.

Methods
The years 2020-2022 in the regions Gelderland and Overijssel were analysed. An overview of all injury
reports was made, analysing who requested them, victim’s details and type of injuries. An inquiry
consisting of 15 questions regarding the quality of the injury reports and contentment about the project
was distributed among confidential doctors and forensic nurses at Veilig Thuis and police employees.
Rechtspraak.nl was searched for jurisprudence from 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022, aiming to analyse the
additional value of injury reports in the criminal prosecution of child abuse.

Results
In total, 78 requests resulting in 112 injury reports were collected. The biggest applicant was Veilig Thuis
in Overijssel, the largest age category was 4-<12 years and blunt trauma was most frequent. The inquiry
revealed high contentment about the project, although the 9 respondents feared a shortage of forensic
doctors. Jurisprudence analysis included 15 verdicts, of which 14 on physical abuse. The injury report was
mentioned 3 times by the public prosecutor, 3 times by the defense attorney and the judges adopted the
reports’ conclusion each time. The judges stated 3 times that the injuries could not be qualified as severe,
without the forensic doctor having indicated the injuries’ severity.

Discussion
This evaluation showed that the renewed injury reports of regional forensic doctors led to great
improvement by bringing specialised forensic care closer and faster to child victims of abuse. There is
great contentment on the quality of the injury reports. However, the task distribution between forensic
and confidential doctors should be discussed and the shortage of forensic doctors handled. The additional
value of the injury reports in criminal prosecution is lowered due to the different medical and legal
definitions of severe physical injury. Therefore, it should be made mandatory for forensic doctors to state
the injures’ severity using an abbreviated injury scale. In a few years, another evaluation should be
performed taking into account the Netherlands as a whole."

It examines the influence of the process of recognition of the Muslim nation in Yugoslavia/Bosnia between 1960-1974 on the textbooks’ depiction of the Ottoman Empire, considered crucial for the Muslims’ historical development. It employs combined qualitative methods to analyze change over time of the contents of the textbooks, before the Muslim recognition (1945-1960), during the process of Muslim recognition (1961-1974) and after it to the end of Socialist Yugoslavia (1975-1990). The thesis examines the function the content served critically and against the grain of scholarship, modern and ex-Yugoslav. It engages with the debates on (ex-)Yugoslav textbooks to highlight some deficiencies in the scholarship, but also study a topic neglected so far. Ministry documents, textbook reviews, curricula and newspapers are also consulted to integrate the textbooks in their appropriate context and relate them to sub-questions regarding the education system, history-writing and discussion of Muslim national identity. The thesis reveals how there were stark continuities in Socialist Yugoslav history-writing with preceding historiographical traditions that depicted the Ottoman Empire as hostile and backward. Secondly, this depiction, evolved with the Muslim recognition and political changes within Yugoslavia. This meant presenting certain aspects of Ottoman rule more positively, albeit to a very limited extent, mirroring the extent of the national recognition of the Muslim nation. Finally, the thesis questions how deep the transformations of the Yugoslav Socialist experiment were, especially considering how the demonized “Turk,” once again emerged in the wars of conquest waged against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the wake of the breakup of Yugoslavia. This same specter emerges in Bosnian public discourse today."

The performance entails nine human performers who move with and touch objects Schot created. These objects are abstract sculptures that most resemble colorful stones, each with their own particular shape, size, weight, texture and color. The human performers are asked to move with and touch the objects in a loving and explorative way, to find out how their own body ‘fits’ aside and in the object’s body. When interviewed, the human performers explain that during this process, they felt that the objects’ shapes, weight, size, temperature and texture made them move and touch in certain ways. The performance manifests a new and challenging way of relating to nonhumans, which is linked in this research to the concept of being-with, as theorized by Donna Haraway. This concept helps Haraway to propose to live together with nonhumans in an inclusive way, in the middle of a society with ecological problems. 
To explore how the objects in Touch, fold, touch, touch perform interactivity and closeness to human performers, this research focuses on the question ‘How do human and object performers in Lola Schot’s artwork Touch, fold, touch, touch (2022) together manifest a relationship of being-with?’ To answer this question, the human performers that took part in the performance were interviewed about their physical and mental experiences. The outcomes were analyzed relationally, by using three core analyzing-concepts that help to discover to what extend the artwork is part of Haraway’s being-with world. These three concepts are: touch, affect and agency. Each concept is used to analyze the artwork through a specific lens and helps to investigate the relationship between the object performers and human performers. 
Throughout this thesis objects and humans are both called performers, since the hypothesis is that the objects to a certain extent influence the development of the performance, in the way they shape the human performers’ approaches that they perform to the objects. This thesis concludes that the performance Touch, fold, touch, touch is a fragmented and semi-theatrical example of ‘being-with’ and can be seen as an open space to practice being-with objects."
Early Prediction of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis using the CRP/Albumin Ratio,"['Lambert, Loes']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-06-26T00:00:40Z,EN,"['pancreatitis, severity, CRP, albumin, ratio']",Medicine,"Background: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disease that can cause potentially lethal complications. Identifying patients at risk for (moderately) severe AP is crucial for appropriate triaging and intervention decisions.
Aim: This preliminary analysis aimed to determine the diagnostic value of the C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin ratio in predicting (moderately) severe AP within 24 and 48 hours.

Methods: We performed a preliminary analysis of a multicentre retrospective cohort study. Patients were selected from studies conducted in 2008 until 2023 by the Dutch Pancreatitis Study Group and were included if data regarding their initial episode of AP was available. CRP and albumin were collected from the first three days of hospitalization and the highest ratios within 24 and 48 hours were calculated. Univariate and multivariate regressions identified predictors, and ROC analyses evaluated predictive accuracy.

Results: The study included 280 patients of whom 125 had (moderately) severe AP. Overall, CRP levels increased and albumin levels decreased during the disease course, leading to higher CRP/albumin ratios. The highest CRP/albumin ratios within 24 and 48 hours, leucocytes and creatinine were individual predictors of (moderately) severe AP. ROC analyses showed modest predictive values for the highest ratios within 24 and 48 hours, with AUCs of 0.582 and 0.607, respectively. High sensitivity cut offs (±80) showed low specificity.

Conclusion: The highest CRP/albumin ratios within 24 and 48 hours correlated significantly with (moderately) severe AP. However, overall predictive accuracy was modest. Small sample size, distribution of severity, and selection bias may have influenced the results. Future analysis with a larger and more representable population is needed to assess the clinical utility of the CRP/albumin ratio as a predictive marker for AP severity."
"Beyond Keywords: Intent-Driven
Semantic Code Search in Software
Ecosystems","['Pfaff, Chris']","['Farshidi, S.']",2023-06-24T00:00:41Z,EN,"['Code search, semantic search, intent modelling, vector embeddings,\nsearch intent, machine learning, iterative learning']",Business Informatics,"The exponential growth of code repositories has posed significant challenges for
developers in efficiently and effectively searching for relevant code snippets. Tradi-
tional keyword-based code search engines often struggle to provide accurate results
due to the ambiguity inherent in programming language keywords and the semantic
gap between the developer’s search intent and the code syntax.
To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel approach—an advanced
semantic code search engine—that harnesses intent modelling and vector embed-
ding techniques to enhance the relevance of search results. Our methodology utilizes
machine learning models to extract the developer’s search intent from their query,
thereby capturing the underlying meaning of their search. Furthermore, the code
snippets are represented using vector embeddings, which capture the semantic con-
text and relationships between different pieces of code. This allows for a more nuanced
understanding of the code snippets’ meanings and functionalities.
The proposed system ranks the code snippets based on their semantic similar-
ity with the user’s search intent. This ranking approach facilitates the delivery of
more accurate and relevant search results, providing developers with a more targeted
and practical search experience. Moreover, the improved relevance of the search re-
sults guides users in the right direction for future searches, fostering an iterative and
progressive learning process.
The findings of this research demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging intent
modelling and vector embedding techniques in enhancing the search capabilities of
code repositories. By bridging the gap between the developer’s search intent and
the code syntax, the proposed semantic code search engine offers a valuable tool for
developers to locate and utilize relevant code snippets effectively."

The chargeable groups can be weak acidic- or basic groups making the HPEs pH responsive. Due to the amphipathic nature of the HPEs, they can strongly interact with lipid bilayer membranes. Depending on the chain architecture and the type of membrane, it is possible for HPEs to solubilize membranes by forming nanodiscs, an ability which can be used to extract membrane proteins together with their native lipid environment. This research showed that the chainlenght of the HPEs can influence the sharpness of the transition in a 2 phase oil and water system. Brightfield- and fluorescent microscopy images showed that the polymer interacts with the membranes in a 3-11 pH range but was not able to solubilize them."

De blinde vlekken van een cross-sectorale netwerksamenwerking: Een kwalitatieve single-casestudy naar het samenwerkingsproces van het netwerk Zichtbaar Sportief.,"['Snooy, Lisa']","['Bottenburg, Maarten van']",2023-06-29T00:00:45Z,NL,"['Netwerksamenwerking, Gehandicaptensport, single-casestudy, samenwerkingsproces.']",Sportbeleid en sportmanagement,"Ondanks het groeiende besef rondom het belang van een gezonde leefstijl en voldoende beweging, loopt de sportparticipatie van mensen met een beperking sterk achter op die van mensen zonder een beperking. Het aanpakken van dit probleem is complex, terwijl het vergroten van de sportparticipatie van deze doelgroep niet alleen gezondheidseffecten heeft, maar ook kan leiden tot meer participatie van mensen met een beperking in de samenleving als geheel en meer zelfredzaamheid voor henzelf. 

In dit onderzoek wordt een single-casestudy uitgevoerd naar het samenwerkingsverband Zichtbaar Sportief. Daarmee wordt een poging gedaan om aan de hand van inzichten uit de literatuur te onderzoeken hoe het samenwerkingsproces verloopt van een netwerk waarin gewerkt wordt aan het verhogen van de sportparticipatie van mensen met een visuele beperking. 

De hoofdvraag van dit onderzoek is als volgt: Hoe verloopt de samenwerking tussen organisaties die het netwerk Zichtbaar Sportief vormen volgens betrokken professionals, welke knelpunten identificeren zij die een toename van de sportparticipatie van mensen met een beperking belemmeren en hoe kunnen deze worden aangepakt? 

Om tot beantwoording van deze hoofdvraag te komen, is een theoretisch model opgesteld aan de hand van vijf verschillende bestaande theoretische inzichten. Naast startcondities, het institutioneel ontwerp, het leiderschap en de uitkomst, staat hierin met name het samenwerkingsproces centraal. Binnen dit samenwerkingsproces worden acht factoren onderscheiden, namelijk: vertrouwen, competenties, doelconsensus, toewijding, flexibiliteit, netwerkomvang, persoonlijke dialoog en tussentijdse resultaten. 

De netwerksamenwerking Zichtbaar Sportief verloopt via een leider-netwerkorganisatie waarbij sprake is van een hoge mate van vertrouwen, doelconsensus, toewijding en flexibiliteit, een grote diversiteit aan competenties, te weinig tijd en aandacht voor persoonlijke dialoog en tussentijdse resultaten met een passend aantal netwerkleden in relatie tot de doelstelling. Zichtbaar Sportief is niet zomaar een samenwerkingsverband tussen verschillende organisaties (inter-organisatorisch), het is een samenwerkingsverband met organisaties uit verschillende sectoren (cross-sectoraal). 

De knelpunten die geïdentificeerd worden als organisatorische knelpunten (binnen de gehele sector van de gehandicaptensport) die het verhogen van de sportparticipatie van mensen met een visuele beperking bemoeilijken zijn rol-onzuiverheid, het ontbreken van een centrale organisatie die de sector aanstuurt, onvoldoende en veelal slechts tijdelijke financiële middelen en de afstand tussen landelijke beleid en lokale uitvoering. Deze knelpunten kunnen aangepakt worden via een netwerksamenwerking, omdat deze organisatievorm zorgt voor de mogelijkheid om cross-sectoraal samen te werken, meer financiële middelen te werven en de werking van synergie. 

Binnen dit onderzoek de volgende vier aanbevelingen gedaan: 
1. Het ministerie van VWS en NOC*NSF wordt aanbevolen om de rollen, taken, verantwoordelijkheden en (financiële) verwachtingen van alle organisaties binnen de gehandicaptensportsector te verduidelijken. 
2. Gehandicaptensport Nederland wordt geadviseerd om als netwerkleider een duidelijkere structuur te organiseren voor het samenwerkingsverband Zichtbaar Sportief. 
3. Gehandicaptensport Nederland wordt geadviseerd om meer te communiceren over de cross sectorale samenwerking, projecten en successen van het netwerk Zichtbaar Sportief. 
4. Vervolgonderzoek is nodig om de effectiviteit van het netwerk Zichtbaar Sportief te onderzoeken op het bereiken van de doelen van het netwerk."

Innovatie in een nieuw daglicht: een onderzoek naar de contextuele verschuiving van een begrip en de impact daarvan op de kunstwereld,"['Ruwaard, Julia']","['Rossem, Patrick van']",2023-06-29T00:00:39Z,EN,[],Kunstgeschiedenis,"In dit kunsthistorische onderzoek wordt de impact van de contextuele en artistieke verschuiving van ‘innovatie’ op de hedendaagse kunstinstelling aangetoond. Voor een lange tijd stond het begrip innovatie bekend als een positieve waarde ter aanduiding van vernieuwing en verbetering. Tegenwoordig worden de keerzijdes van modernisering en constante vooruitgang echter steeds zichtbaarder. De economische, sociale en culturele wetenschappen betwisten de Westerse betekenis van ‘innovatie’ gevormd door de vrijemarkteconomie en bevragen of deze altijd gelijk staat aan verbetering. Ook in de kunsten vindt er een transitie plaats wat innovatie betreft. Gedurende het modernisme was artistieke innovatie het belangrijkste criteria van kunst. Maar kan artistieke innovatie nog wel functioneren als een waardeoordeel wanneer ‘innovatie’ bevraagd wordt? En op wat voor manier gaat de hedendaagse kunstruimte hiermee om?
            Om deze vraag te beantwoorden wordt ten eerste de evolutie van innovatie als een begrip uiteengezet. Dit neutrale concept voor nieuwheid wordt vanaf de negentiende eeuw langzamerhand gecommercialiseerd en ontwikkelt zich gedurende de twintigste eeuw uit tot betwistbare innovatie-ideologie: de overtuiging dat technologische vooruitgang resulteert in sociale verbetering. Vervolgens wordt deze contextuele verschuiving van innovatie in relatie gebracht met de daaraan gerelateerde ontwikkelingen in de kunsten: het modernisme en postmodernisme. Hieruit blijkt de artistieke verschuiving van innovatie. Oftewel, de transitie van artistieke vernieuwing naar het tijdperk van reproductie.
             Het tweede hoofdstuk behandelt uiteenlopende theorieën omtrent de gevolgen van deze tweeledige verschuiving van ‘innovatie’ op de hedendaagse kunst. Er komen verschillende manieren aan bod waarop kunst een rol kan spelen in de destructieve effecten van modernisering: kunst kan resonantie opwekken en worden ingezet tegen vervreemding, verlichten door de gevolgen van versnelling op een overdreven manier te onderstrepen, en bepaalde niet-Westerse noties en benaderingen aftasten. Ook komt in dit hoofdstuk het belang van de kunstruimte naar voren in de groeiende vraag naar representatie. 
               Het derde hoofdstuk betreft twee casestudies van hedendaagse kunstruimtes. Duidelijk wordt dat ‘innovatie’ van het esthetische naar het maatschappelijke veld is verschoven. Artistieke vernieuwing fungeert hier niet langer als criteria. Deze kunstruimtes tonen vernieuwing door een prominente positie aan te nemen binnen de samenleving en innovatieve oplossingen aan te dragen voor maatschappelijke problemen. Uit de conclusie blijkt dat ‘innovatie’ anders in de mond wordt genomen in de hedendaagse kunstruimte."
Creative Writing as a Technology of Resistance,"['Aljoudi, Naya']","['Mascat, Jamila']",2023-06-29T00:00:43Z,EN,"['Technologies, Resistance, Othering, Censorship, Taboos']",Gender Studies,"["""",""""] This research investigates creative writing by SWANA refugee authors as a technology to resist dominant forms of censorship and repression. The research is two-fold, it relies on a theoretical approach where narrative is employed as theory, and a practical analysis based on the methodology of Liminagraphy. This approach aims to answer the question: In what ways can creative writing cultivate resistance and collective liberation as a technology of censored SWANA refugees? The theoretical framework discusses Resistance Literature in Mahmoud Darwish’s works as a form of resisting colonial rule, identity erasure and death. The transformation of his poetic experience helps portray the different definitions of resistance through emotional and philosophical forms. The research then connects the cultivated theories to the experiences of various other SWANA authors by documenting their works and interviewing them. By making use of Liminagraphy, the research highlights the importance of story sharing through the authors’ works, where the dominant “I” is delinked, and trials are made to construct unities under “we”. The chosen documented pieces (short stories, poems) are analyzed along with the interviews with authors, and they are analyzed in collectivity. Resistance manifests differently among every author, there are contradictions, complexities and confirmations of resistance, all expressed uniquely to every author. In the first practical analysis, we see the complexity of resistance as power has ever-lasting effects on the author and the story’s hero. It seems possible to rebel against power through language, however, it soon returns to the hero’s body and stays there forever. We also see the complexity of resistance when creative language fails to engage with the collective “we”, making creativity weak within individualistic approaches against systems of oppression. In the second analysis, the author expresses resistance in a multifaceted way, first in resistance to death by the hero of the story, where he defeats and resists death continuously with the language. Secondly, the author chooses to expose the tumors invading SWANA society through her creative writing to resist patriarchy. In the third analysis, resistance shows its contradictions, where the author is pessimistic and believes writing is secondary in the project for liberation, yet his stories document and reveal realities in which resistance takes form against imprisonment and torture. In the fourth analysis, resistance is very clear, especially against the colonial rule of Palestine and rejecting racism within The Netherlands. The authors collectively take on different systems of censorship and oppression and deal with them in their work. When analyzed in unity, creative writing appears to succeed in formulating resistance and aspirations for collective liberation for SWANA authors."
Association of physical activity with survival and severe immune-related adverse events in patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibition.,"['Cabane Ballester, Anna']","['May, A.M.']",2023-06-27T00:00:48Z,EN,['physical activity; immune related adverse events; immunotherapy; cancer; immune checkpoint inhibition'],Epidemiology,"For patients diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, immunotherapies, known as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have improved outcomes for many patients. These new treatments target the immune system to maximise its function and attack cancer cells. However, there is a major downside to these drugs: they can cause severe adverse events due to the heightened immune response and are known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The novelty of these drugs highlights that further research is needed to find specific characteristics and lifestyle behaviours of patients that could affect overall survival (OS) and the occurrence of immune-related adverse events.
Given the well-established connection between exercise and improved immune-system function, it is hypothesized that physical activity (PA) could enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. In this study, we investigated the association between PA and OS and the development of irAEs of patients undergoing ICI therapy.
To conduct this research, participants reported their average weekly PA levels through a questionnaire, at the onset of treatment, and relevant clinical data was collected. The main research questions were studied using various statistical analyses including survival analysis and logistic regression, for OS and correlations with irAEs, respectively.
Our results show that patients who report higher levels of PA have improved OS, and lower occurrence of irAEs, however future research is needed to investigate whether sedentary patients could benefit from increased PA after diagnosis."

the effects of dynamic grid reconfiguration on local distribution grids were
studied. This was done by creating several scenarios of what the distribution
grid at Utrecht Science Park (USP) would be subjected to in the future, and
modelling the effects that reconfigurability would have on this grid. It was
found that in several possible future scenarios USP’s distribution grid would
be severely congested in the future, and that most of that congestion could be
mitigated by the introduction of dynamic reconfigurability."
Visual learning before sight:  Mapping spontaneous synaptic input in the developing visual cortex at subcellular scale,"['Kaal, Marthe']","['Snoek, Basten']",2023-06-27T00:00:55Z,EN,['Neurodevelopment; spontaneous activity; dendritic signal integration; synapse; calcium imaging; python'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Dendritic signal integration does not only happen linearly across the dendrite, but also supralinearly. Locally, active dendritic spikes can be generated as a result of clustered synaptic activity. Thus, a single neuron functions as multiple computational subunits, that allow for parallel processing and substantially boost the brain’s computational power. In addition, co-active synapses are clustered together on the dendrite, both during development and in mature neurons. This structure likely already arises in the mouse primary visual cortex during the spontaneous network events that occur during development, before its eyes open. In the two weeks between birth and eye-opening, many new synaptic connections are being formed, based on chemical cues and activity patterns. However, the timepoint and manner in which the clustered synaptic structure arises, remains to be elucidated. Calcium imaging was performed on L2/3 pyramidal neuron dendrites of the primary visual cortex in the second postnatal week (postnatal day 5 + 3-7 days-in-vitro). Here, for the first time, spontaneously induced synaptic inputs were analysed in organotypic slice cultures of the mouse primary visual cortex at the subcellular scale. Synapse density and the event frequency increase rapidly before eye opening. In addition, the organization of synapses along the dendrite is likely already spatially and functionally structured during the second postnatal week. This model allows for extensive further assays to unravel the underlying physiological mechanisms."

Subsequently, existing formal dialogue systems are discussed and finally, a new formal dialogue system is constructed. This new dialogue system implements various aspects: it allows for different user-types (lay users and experts), it allows for personalized explanations in terms of various question and explanation styles, plus, various explanation functions are usable.

Recent events, such as Switzerland’s election to the UN Security Council and the Russo-Ukrainian war, have put the country’s neutrality into question. This thesis aims to fill the gap in understanding the evolution of public debate on Swiss neutrality from the government’s successful campaign to join the UN in 2002 to the recent criticism from the right-wing, represented by the Swiss People’s Party (SVP). The impact of domestic discourse on foreign policy, particularly from the right-wing, has received limited attention in previous research. Public debate, including political and demographic data, is examined through the lens of neutrality as a decision-making framework. Findings reveal that the UN accession provided a starting point for the SVP to refine their neutrality definition. The ‘neutrality initiative’ symbolises the preliminary climax of the shift of the right-wing from a reactive to a proactive stance on neutrality. The government seems to merely react to the SVP’s efforts to anchor their neutrality definition in the constitution. This thesis sheds light on the complexities of Swiss neutrality and underlines the need for a comprehensive and robust neutrality definition to shape public discourse and policy decisions.""""]"

Direct simulation of the entire system is also inefficient, as our interest lies primarily in the behavior of the mesoscopic colloids. We employ machine learning methods to learn effective many-body interactions for a colloid-only system from direct simulations of the full system.

that play crucial roles in developmental patterning and phenotypic evolution. Embryonic expression
patterns of toolkit genes influence cell behaviour, and thereby shape the adult phenotype. In
addition, toolkit genes play a role in regeneration, cancer and ageing. Despite their biological
importance, there is no definitive list of toolkit genes. Our aim here is to compile such a list. We first
searched five databases for genes related to the development of the tetrapod limb, a wellresearched
model of evolution and development. This yielded 1,825 genes. Toolkit genes typically
show pleiotropy, whereby they are involved in the development of multiple organ systems. We
therefore eliminated limb‐only genes by screening against the genomes of eight limbless tetrapods
(snakes). We also added tetrapod orthologues of Drosophila patterning mutants from the
Heidelberg screen. Manual curation removed non‐toolkit genes, and added missing ones. Our final
list contains 484 toolkit genes — among them transcriptional regulators (58.8%), signaling molecules
(17.8%) and transmembrane signal receptors (9.3%). The HOX and FOX families, together with the
TGF‐β superfamily, were the most highly represented gene families. Our list of toolkit genes,
representing 2–3% of protein‐coding genes in the tetrapod genome, is provisional. It represents an
important step towards a deeper understanding of the evolution and development of animal
morphology. Finally, we suggest that it can constitute an entirely new gene ontology class: ‘toolkit
gene’."

The space required for farming (i.e., rice) will likely increase to feed a growing world population. Research on plant growth responses, may contribute to understanding factors limiting potential yield. Plants absorb mostly red and blue light for photosynthesis and reflect green and far-red light. Therefore, neighbouring plants, especially in high density growth conditions, lower ambient R:FR ratios. This triggers a range of responses referred to as the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS), in shade-avoiding plants. The SAS is important as it may negatively impact yield and limit the density of crops grown in agriculture. In this report, we discuss an observed response of rice to low R:FR light conditions that is atypical of what generally is observed in the SAS. The research question was: why is the observed response of rice under low R:FR light conditions so distinctly different from the typical SAS? We have seen increased or decreased shoot biomass and number of tillers (branches) and leaves in rice grown in FR light in autumn or winter, respectively. As an extension to existing literature, our results suggest that FR light and light that can be used for photosynthesis together, determine the growth response of rice under low R:FR light conditions. Additionally, we found that, even though it has not been described in other literature, rice also shows a (typical) SAS. We concluded this after a light treatment that removes the effect of FR light on photosynthesis. Then, we also investigated how different genes of interest were expressed in rice that was grown under low R:FR light conditions. We grew rice and exposed it to FR light 5 days after sowing, and harvested three tissues (meristem, culm and leaves) separately at three different timepoints (19, 24 and 29 hours after FR light exposure). We used these samples to determine different expression patterns in low R:FR grown rice compared to control grown rice in a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. Our genes of interest likely play a role in plant hormone biosynthesis, cell division, the SAS pathway, photosynthesis, and flowering. We have found a potential role of plant hormones (auxin and ethylene) in mediating the response to low R:FR light conditions. Increased biomass or number of leaves and tillers may be due to increased cell division, based on CYCB1;1 expression. Two genes encoding photosynthetic components (PSBR and PSB1B2) also showed a response in their expression, though the differential expression is not uniform. FPFL3 is a gene that was most strongly differentially expressed, though its function is unknown. Lastly PIL16, an upstream component of the SAS pathway, was upregulated. This may indicate that even in rice that responds atypically to low R:FR light conditions, responses of the SAS are still present, and the pathway is still active, but it is probably attenuated or inhibited more downstream in the pathway."

The components diet, physical activity, sleep health, nicotine exposure, body mass index, blood glucose, blood lipids, blood pressure were all given a score between 0 and 100 and an overall LE8 score was created. The overall LE8 score was averaged and categorized into low cardiovascular health (CVH, 0-49), moderate CVH (50-79), and high CVH (80-100). AF cases were obtained through linkage with registries.

Compared to the high CVH score (19.5%), participants with a low CVH score (5%) had a 1.99 times higher hazard for incident AF (hazard ratio = 1.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.49 – 2.65) in a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, education level, heart failure, coronary heart disease, and alcohol consumption. Furthermore, an ideal component decrease was associated with a 1.11 times higher risk for incident AF (95% CI = 1.05 – 1.18).
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that a worse CVH, indicated by a lower LE8 score, is associated with an increased risk for incident AF."
The Disenchantment of the World? The evolution of belief in witchcraft in England and the Netherlands during the nineteenth century,"['Janssen, Noortje']","['Vartija, Devin']",2023-06-30T00:00:46Z,EN,['Belief; Witchcraft; Superstition; Evolution; England; The Netherlands'],Geschiedenis van Politiek en Maatschappij,"This thesis challenges the proposition that belief in witchcraft vanished in the face of modernity by studying its evolution in nineteenth-century England and the Netherlands. By employing multidisciplinary approaches, it explores belief dynamics through linguistic and cultural lenses. Using newspaper articles, ethnographic research, and folklore studies, this study examines witchcraft beliefs' linguistic expressions and cultural contexts. The analysis of 55 Dutch and 61 English articles reveals divergent trends influenced by urbanisation, literacy, police professionalisation, and witch doctors. Despite shared believer identities and influencing factors, contextual variations shape believers' actions. Comparing quantitative content analysis exposes significant differences in witchcraft belief evolution. Linguistic analysis provides insights into its social and cultural relevance, particularly regarding violence. Moreover, the results showcase a continuance of belief in witchcraft to a certain extent. This study highlights the need for a comprehensive exploration of nineteenth-century witchcraft beliefs, challenging the notion of complete disenchantment in modernity and promoting nuanced understandings of evolving belief systems. Recognising limitations in newspaper selection, further research with additional English sources is recommended."
Electron-Activated Dissociation for Glycan Identification with Ion Mobility-Tandem Mass Spectrometry,"['Hooijschuur, Kevin']","['Boons, Geert-Jan']",2023-06-29T23:01:16Z,EN,['Glycans; mass spectrometry; electron-activated dissociation; ion mobility'],Drug Innovation,"The structural complexity and diversity of glycans has limited the understanding of the roles that these essential biomolecules play in homeostasis and disease. Methods that fully characterize glycan structure have been lacking. Tandem mass spectrometry dissociates glycans into fragments, the mass of which provides information about the intact structure. Electron-activated dissociation (ExD) provides more informative fragmentation than conventional collision induced dissociation, but access to this technique is restricted. We describe the development of ExD for glycan analysis using a linear, non-trapping cell mounted in an ion mobility-quadrupole-time of flight instrument. This configuration performs ExD on ion mobility-quadrupole selected glycans and was applied to discriminate between five isomeric human milk oligosaccharides using glycosidic cleavages, cross-ring cleavages, and secondary fragmentation patterns. This work shows that ExD can provide an additional level of characterization that is rapid enough to be compatible with liquid chromatography and ion mobility spectrometry."
Synthesis and Characterisation of a GRPR and PSMA Targeting Heterodimer for Theranostic Applications in Prostate Cancer,"['Markink, Job']","['Rijkers, Dirk']",2023-06-30T00:00:48Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common cancer in the world for which diagnostic and therapeutic techniques require optimization. Currently the most used techniques for diagnosis are invasive digital rectal exams and blood prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing, which produces false negative and false positive results. In addition, PC overexpresses different biomarkers at different tumor stages making diagnosis and novel treatment difficult to perform. This report investigates the synthesis and characterization of PSMA and GRPR targeting heterodimers, used as a diagnostic for early and late-stage PC as well as targeted therapy. Two compounds were synthesized both containing NeoB, a PSMA targeting ligand and a DOTAGA chelator for complexing with diagnostic or therapeutic radionuclides. The platform for linking peptides utilizes a tetrazine functionality to achieve biorthogonal addition of chelators via an inverse electron demand Diels Alder (IEDDA) reaction. A cysteine on the N-terminus of the peptides allow for a biorthogonal cyano-thiol cycloaddition click reaction with the cyanopyrimidine. Two different lengths of the platform and the use of cyanopyrimidine functionalities were tested for stability. Unfortunately, the potential clinical application is limited by the poor stability of the cyanopyrimidine platform. Substituting the cyanopyrimidine functionality for tetrafluorophenyl (TFP) made the attachment of the peptides possible by increasing the stability of the platform. The reaction used to attach the peptides loses its biorthogonality but does result in the final heterodimers that can be used for further testing. The peptides were attached to a tetraflourophenyl activated platform via an amino hexanoic acid linker. Radiochemical yields and purities were determined for both final compounds."
Association Between Air Pollution and Disruption of Iron Homeostasis,"['Taenzer, Julia']","['Cassee, Flemming']",2023-06-30T00:00:38Z,EN,['air pollutants; particulate matter; iron homeostasis; anemia'],Health and Environment,"Air pollution remains a growing source of concern as research in recent years has revealed evidence of significant adverse health impacts and toxicological effects stemming from exposure to ambient air pollution. Epidemiological studies on the effects of air pollutants have found a clear association between exposure to air pollutants and adverse health effects such as cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunction, autoimmune disorders, and dysfunctions of the central nervous system. This is especially the case for particulate matter. The observed adverse health effects indicate a perturbation of primary cellular mechanisms caused by inhalation of particulate matter that lead to the occurrence of negative health effects. This paper reviews the association between exposure to air pollutants, specifically particulate matter, and the disruption of iron homeostasis in the human biological system. This was done by a literature review of previous research projects and studies as well as published reviews on related topics. This includes literature on the causes of iron dishomeostasis, frequency of anemia in highly polluted countries, causes of oxidative stress and inflammatory response, and how certain cellular response mechanisms are triggered by air pollutants.
It is suspected that oxidative stress and inflammatory response play a critical role in the processes that lead to perturbation of iron homeostasis, and in some cases, anemia. In this review, the mechanisms of action by which inhaled pollutants affect the respiratory system are unraveled to gain an understanding of how the biological system defends against an inhaled threat. When a threat, in this case particulate matter, is introduced into the human respiratory system there is possibility for the cellular defense mechanisms of the respiratory system to become overwhelmed. This can lead to the activation of a range of signaling mechanisms which result in a state of oxidative stress in the cell. Often the occurrence of oxidative stress is soon after followed by an acute inflammatory response. The processes by which particulate matter can initiate these mechanisms and signaling cascades are analyzed and discussed in connection to the resulting disturbance of iron homeostasis in the biological system.
Previous research has found a distinct association between exposure to air pollutants and the disruption of iron homeostasis. Several mechanisms have been suggested to lead to the cellular disruption of iron homeostasis. These include the chelation or complexation of iron by the pollutant, initiation and perpetuation of oxidative stress through various pathways, and triggering of acute inflammatory response. The disruption of iron homeostasis can lead to the development of anemia, which particularly for those who are immunocompromised, such as children, pregnant individuals, and seniors, can have a range of negative health impacts including the development and perpetuation of disease, and even mortality. This literature review was conducted in aims of gaining a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms that occur in response to the inhalation of particulate matter into the human system and how these mechanisms lead to the disruption of iron homeostasis, and in some cases, anemia."
Localized immunomodulation technologies to enable cellular and organoid transplantation,"['Lokhorst, Nienke']","['Mastrobattista, Enrico']",2023-06-30T00:00:50Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"Cellular therapies have the potential to revolutionize medicine by using living cells to restore damaged

therapies have been approved or are currently being evaluated in clinical trials, the immune response to 
these therapies can be a barrier to their success. Innovative local immunomodulatory techniques can help 
by either reducing the risk of rejection or promoting immune tolerance to cellular therapies. For this 
purpose, cells are encapsulated in next-generation biomaterials to protect them from the immune system, 
mRNA therapeutics and nanoparticles are used to induce tolerance and prime specific immune cells, or
genetic manipulation is used to design cells that can mitigate the immune response or lack essential 
surface molecules for immunorecognition to yield universal hypoimmune cell sources. Overall, keeping in

Demystifying normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for greenness exposure assessments and policy interventions in urban greening,"['De La Iglesia Martinez, Alex']","['Labib, Labib']",2023-06-29T23:01:13Z,EN,['NDVI; green spaces; greenness exposure; policy interventions; urban greening'],Applied Data Science,"Most nature and health research use the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for measuring
greenness exposure. However, little is known about what NDVI measures in terms of vegetation types
(e.g., grass, canopy coverage) within certain analysis zones (e.g., 500m buffer). Additionally, more
exploration is needed to understand how to interpret changes in NDVI (e.g., per 0.1 increments) for
policy intervention in urban greening. This study aims to address such gaps in the literature. We,
therefore, measured mean values of NDVI and other vegetation metrics for different buffer zones
(100, 300, and 500 m) at sample locations within the Greater Manchester study area by applying focal
statistics. For each scale, we fitted linear and nonlinear (i.e., GAM) regression models to explore (1)
what vegetation types and amounts best predict the NDVI values in a multivariate model and (2) how
changes in NDVI explain changes in different vegetation coverages in univariate models. We found
that NDVI is most sensitive to tree canopy at 300 meters scale and that changes at different levels of
vegetation values and types predict dissimilar changes in NDVI. The models with three vegetation
types can explain approximately 80% variance in NDVI values (i.e., Pseudo R²) for buffer zones of
300 and 500 meters. We observed that forb and shrub density is most sensitive (12.21% change) to
mid-range increments in mean NDVI (0.45 to 0.55) within 300 meters. These sensitivities usually
follow nonlinear patterns for all the vegetation types in multivariate and univariate models. Our
results indicate that NDVI values are more sensitive to certain types and amounts of vegetation within
various buffer zones. Overall, interpreting changes in NDVI values for urban greening interventions
would require careful evaluation of the relative changes in types and quantities of vegetation for
different buffer zones."
Food insecurity and HIV  medication adherence among people living with HIV in rural South-Africa,"['Geuns, Dorine van']","['Klipstein-Grobusch, Kerstin']",2023-06-30T00:00:44Z,EN,"['HIV, ART, food insecurity, South-Africa']",Epidemiology,"Treatment adherence is crucial for people living with HIV to prevent suppression of the immune system and drug resistance. However, adherence is not always optimal and is influenced by many factors. There are social, psychological and biological reasons for not adhering to a treatment regimen. Food insecurity may increase immune suppression and is associated with worse health behaviors. We conducted this research to assess whether food insecurity is related to poor treatment adherence among people living with HIV in rural South Africa. We found that in women food insecurity is related to poor treatment adherence, but this was not observed for men. This involved both moderate and severe food insecurity. Therefore, this gender inequality regarding food insecurity should be addressed. Women had lower income, more depressive symptoms, were more often unemployed, less likely to have a stable relationship and less likely to be on treatment. This lower socio-economic status compared to men indicates that women should be empowered in order to mitigate this difference. More research is needed to address these differentials in food security and ART adherence between men and women. Additionally, further qualitative research should focus on reasons for non-adhering to treatment."

Information on lifestyle and diet was obtained at baseline through questionnaires. For this study, lifestyle factors including smoking, alcohol consumption, Mediterranean diet score, body mass index and Cambridge Physical Activity Index were assessed.
Results: 193 carcinoid cases were diagnosed. Smoking was significantly associated with NET development in multivariable analysis in all NETs (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.02 – 2.11) and gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.04 – 2.41). Alcohol consumption was not associated with NET development. Hazard ratios for medium (7-10 points) and high adherence (11-18 points) to the Mediterranean diet were 0.71 (95% CI 0.51 – 0.98) and 0.39 (95% CI 0.25 – 0.62) for all NETs, 0.47 (95% CI 0.25 – 0.90) and 0.36 (95% CI 0.15 – 0.86) in lung NETs, and 0.80 (95% CI 0.55 – 1.16) and 0.40 (95% CI 0.23 – 0.69) in GEP NETs. Obesity was statistically not-significantly associated with NET development (HR 1.54, 95% CI 0.99 – 2.41). Physical activity was not found as an associated factor with NET development.
Conclusion: Smoking is strongly associated with NET development in both the entire NET population and GEP NETs in the EPIC cohort. Body mass index increases the risk of NET development. Increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet has a protective association with NETs."

The perspective of the owners on the 30-day lasting treatment with meglumine antimoniate injections and the quality of the dog’s life,"['Eijk, Demy van']","['Piek, C.J.']",2023-06-30T23:01:03Z,EN,['Canine; Leishmaniosis; meglumine antimoniate; glucantime; perspective; quality of life; QoL; questionnaire'],Geneeskunde van gezelschapsdieren,"Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is a global zoonotic disease, fatal for both humans and dogs. There are already endemics in over 70 countries in the world. The current first-choice therapy of CanL is chemotherapy with Pentavalent antimonials (SbV), used as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs (allopurinol® most of the time) to prevent relapses. The treatment is long, cumbersome, unpleasant for dogs and owners and renal disorders are frequently diagnosed. Besides that, the therapy is very costly. The perception of the owners on this therapy and the quality of life (QoL) of the dogs during the treatment is so far unknown. This work has investigated this by using a questionnaire.
A questionnaire was composed, which was done by comparing different literature studies and books about questionnaires. The questions investigated the perception of the owners on the 30-day treatment with meglumine antimoniate injections and the quality of the dog’s life. 60 of the 87 owners filled in the questionnaire, which gives the questionnaire a 69 percent response rate.
The majority of the owners did think applying the medication was easy, the dogs did not seem to be bothered that much and they reported that when they had problems or questions, they could always ask their veterinarians. Also, the owner’s QoL scored high. A small increase of dog QoL is seen during the treatment and an even bigger increase of dog QoL one month after the treatment. There is not one standard trajectory in which the treatment will occur. Every dog has got its own trajectory. When looking at the positive outcomes, it can be concluded that a great majority of 95 percent of the dogs improved their QoL due to the treatment. Therefore, it can be concluded, together with the owner’s conclusions, that the therapy is worthwhile."
Sampling-based Stochastic Single-machine Scheduling,"['Rietmole, Puck te']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-06-30T00:00:52Z,EN,"['Scheduling, job-shop, algorithm, discrete optimization, one-shot learning, learning-augmented, sampling']",Mathematical Sciences,"The problem to be considered is non-preemptive stochastic single machine scheduling to minimize the
total weighted completion time of a set of N jobs. This is a classical problem setting that has been
studied in the literature on scheduling, with many applications in operations research. In this thesis, we
try to understand algorithms and models where the underlying probability distributions are unknown,
and processing times can only be assessed via samples. Specifically, the thesis asks what can be done
when there is one single sample only.

Whenever the expected processing times are known exactly, it is known since the 1960's that one
must schedule jobs in decreasing order of weight over expected processing time. For the setting with
access to only one sample of the processing time, we define SWOPS, the algorithm that Schedules by
Weights Over Processing Time Samples. This algorithm is the most intuitive candidate for a better-
than-random algorithm. We first formalize the concept of comparing algorithm performance. This allows
us to formulate our main research question; in which scenarios does SWOPS perform at least as well as
R, the uniformly random algorithm? We show by counter-example that in general, the performance of
SWOPS can be arbitrarily worse than R, motivating that our research question is not trivial. We then
show that the matter of comparing relative performance of algorithms can be simplified to a case where
the number of jobs N equals 2. We also introduce a novel concept called the Relative Optimality Gap
(ROG) of an algorithm. This scales the algorithm's cost to always lie in the interval [0,1], where a ROG
of 0 corresponds to an optimal algorithm and a ROG of 1 means the expected performance is the worst
possible. It is then proven that finding an upper ROG-bound of at most 1/2 on an algorithm A is equivalent
to showing that A performs at least as well as R.

We apply these methods to several scenarios, for different types of processing time distributions, and
show that SWOPS performs well in these cases. The first scenario is when processing time distributions are
symmetric. Second, when all processing time distributions are translated versions of the same underlying
distribution. Third, when all processing time distributions are linearly scaled versions of the same under-
lying distribution. Lastly, we consider several special sub-cases for exponentially distributed processing
times.

In the end, we discuss what perspective these findings give us about the performance of SWOPS. We
also speculate about the broader implications of our results, in terms of what types of critical failure
modes might exist when insufficient samples are available."
"Technological Diversification in Peripheral Regions: An Empirical Study on the Importance of
Interregional Linkages across European Regions","['Kragting, Sebastiaan']","['Wanzenböck, Iris']",2023-06-30T01:00:48Z,EN,['Peripheral Regions; Evolutionary Economic Geography; Technological Diversification'],Innovation Sciences,"This thesis puts the literature on Evolutionary Economic Geography central and assumes that technological diversification is necessary in peripheral regions to foster sustainable and inclusive growth across regions. However, the paradox is that peripheral regions are less probable to diversify because they tend to lock-into their existing specialisations. Therewith, the knowledge production in peripheral regions is low, and due to the principle of relatedness, peripheral regions are prone to lock-into their narrow knowledge base. The literature on economic geography suggests that interregional linkages leads to external knowledge spillovers and therefore complements internal knowledge production. Thus, interregional collaboration is especially important for peripheral regions to escape a lock-in into their existing specialisations. This thesis scrutinises this general perception on interregional linkages by explaining that core and peripheral regions receive different benefits from external knowledge spillovers. The main research question is: How do the interregional linkages with core and peripheral regions affect the probability of a region to technologically diversify?

To answer this question the thesis adheres to a quantitative explanatory and exploratory approach to understand technological diversification in core and peripheral regions. The analyses draws upon economic and patent data between 2005-2018 to investigate the entry of technological fields. The conclusions are as following. First, regression models suggest that external knowledge spillovers from core regions are of greater importance to technological diversification than that from peripheral regions. Further analysis of assortative mixing shows that core regions increasingly collaborate with core regions whilst peripheral regions remain rigid and do not increase in interregional collaboration. Therefore, the importance of interregional collaboration seems promising in theory but might not entirely enable peripheral regions to catch-up to core regions. Nevertheless, external knowledge spillovers through collaboration remain crucial for technological diversification in peripheral regions. Second, a network analysis of co-invention reveals that those peripheral regions that do diversify are exceptionally high in betweenness centrality. Likely, these regions can function as a bridge between core and peripheral regions, for instance, due to providing access to different labour markets (and migration), or flows of natural resources. Third, whilst peripheral regions do show low novelty in technological diversification, an unexpected novel finding is that core regions that do collaborate with peripheral regions show highest novelty in technological diversification. Therefore, potentially, the collaboration between core and peripheral regions induces recombination of knowledge that is new to the world."

When and why we choose to offload information: Understanding the ongoing trade-off between internal memory storage and external sampling,"['Elbertse, Lisa']","['Stigchel, Stefan van der']",2023-07-04T00:01:15Z,EN,['Cognitive offloading; Working memory; Individual differences; Metacognition; Cognitive effort; Group differences'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"If your answer to one of the following questions is ‘yes’, you, among many other people, make use of the so-called principle ‘cognitive offloading’. Do you program appointments into your calendar? Or do you put your keys next to the door, so you don’t forget to bring them with you? These are all examples of cognitive offloading which can be described as the process of using external tools such as your calendar to help you remember information. If you don’t use it, all information needs to be remembered by your brain solely. Your memory has a limited capacity so the use of cognitive offloading in daily life can be very useful. 
	In daily life, people are constantly making the decision to store information internally in their working memory or externally with the use of cognitive offloading. This decision can be seen as a cost-benefit analysis because individuals constantly need to weigh the benefit of using cognitive offloading against the cost of storing the information internally in their memory. In scientific research, the phenomenon of cognitive offloading is mostly investigated with the use of two tasks. The first task is the copying task, during this task individuals need to recreate a model. The individuals can make use of cognitive offloading by looking at the model more often to store new information in their memory. The other task is the intention offloading task, during which individuals need to put ten circles in a numerical sequence. However, some circles need to be dragged to other places on the screen. The individuals can make use of cognitive offloading during the task by setting reminders for the location of these ‘special’ circles. 
	Several factors could influence the decision, that we constantly make during daily life, on where to store information. These factors could be task specific, such as increasing the cost attached to cognitive offloading during a task or increasing the amount of information that needs to be remembered (memory load). Other factors that could influence the decision differ between individuals, such as the capacity of their internal memory storage or the confidence that they have about their own memory performances. One other factor that could potentially have an effect is the cognitive effort that is attached to the act of remembering information. Individuals tend to avoid cognitive effort because of the limited capacity of their memory storage. Group differences such as age or patient groups could also have an effect on the decision to offload information or not. This review looked at studies that investigated the effects of these factors and thereby made several conclusions. First, increasing the cost of cognitive offloading made individuals offload less information. Furthermore, increasing the memory load, lower internal memory capacity, lower confidence in their memory, older age and memory deficits made individuals offload more information to external tools. These factors could therefore contribute to practical implications for designing tools and environments that influence individuals’ behaviour and support information processing and storage in daily life, such as note-taking apps, reminder systems, virtual assistants, and cognitive training software. These tools can be of particular importance for specific groups such as older adults and patients with memory deficits to help them stay independent."
Regionale dementienetwerken: effectief georganiseerde zorg door verandering in network governance,"['Agterdenbos, Joost']","['Loyens, K.M.']",2023-07-04T00:01:04Z,NL,['Regionale dementienetwerken; governance; network governance; collaborative governance; verandering.'],"Organisaties, verandering en management","De Wetenschappelijk Raad voor het Regeringsbeleid (2021) stelt dat de zorg in de toekomst onhoudbaar is. De vergrijzing van Nederland speelt hier een grote rol in. Waar nu één op de zes inwoners van Nederland de leeftijd van 65 jaar bereikt heeft, zal dit in 2040 één op de vier inwoners zijn (Ministerie van VWS, 2020). Als gevolg hiervan zullen de uitgaven aan de ouderenzorg bij ongewijzigd beleid in ongeveer 20 jaar verdubbelen (Ministerie van VWS, 2020). Een grote en tevens snel toenemende kostenpost in de ouderenzorg is dementie. Dementie ontwikkelt zich namelijk tot de belangrijkste doodsoorzaak en duurste aandoening in Nederland (Ministerie van VWS, 2020).
Dementie is een klinisch syndroom van verslechtering in meerdere cognitieve domeinen, wat invloed heeft op activiteiten van het dagelijks leven en het alledaags functioneren, dat van nature progressief is en niet het gevolg is van omkeerbare oorzaken (Huijsman, 2023). Bij dementie zijn er veel verschillende vormen van zorg en ondersteuning nodig, aangezien de behoeften van dementiepatiënten veranderen gedurende het ziekteverloop. Zo is er aan het begin van het ziekteverloop vaak behoefte aan ondersteuning, bijvoorbeeld in de vorm van hulp in de huishouding of dagbesteding. In een later ziektestadium is er vaak meer behoefte aan zorg, bijvoorbeeld in de vorm van thuiszorg of verpleeghuiszorg. Vanwege de combinatie van behoefte aan sociale- en medische hulp is het belangrijk dat organisaties hier coöperatief op inspelen. Voor de organisatie van dementiezorg is dan ook samenwerking vereist tussen de verschillende betrokken partijen, welke in veel regio’s georganiseerd is in dementienetwerken. In Nederland zijn er in totaal ongeveer 60 regionale dementienetwerken, waarin professionals met elkaar werken aan goede zorg en ondersteuning voor mensen met dementie (Zorg voor beter, z.d.). Denk hierbij aan professionals zoals casemanagers, geriaters, VVT-managers en beleidsmedewerkers van gemeenten.
Ondanks het bestaan van deze regionale dementienetwerken, blijft het organiseren van passende zorg in de praktijk lastig. Dit komt door het feit dat er een complex veld is met onduidelijke governance. Het is onduidelijk wie er nu bestuurt en verantwoordelijk is (van Leeuwen, van Lindenberg & Hoff, 2023). Er wordt als gevolg hiervan moeizaam samengewerkt door alle betrokken partijen. Daarnaast zijn er regionale verschillen in de kwaliteit van zorg en ondersteuning voor mensen met dementie en hun mantelzorgers. De dementiezorg zal anders georganiseerd moeten worden om te zorgen dat deze zorg betaalbaar blijft en mensen met dementie de juiste zorg kunnen organiseren en ontvangen (Taskforce Juiste Zorg op de Juiste Plek, z.d., p. 62). In dit onderzoek is dan ook door middel van kwalitatief onderzoek, in de vorm van 13 interviews met netwerkcoördinatoren en twee focusgroepen met respondenten die lid zijn van een regionaal dementienetwerk (onder andere een klinisch geriater, bestuurder van een VVT-organisatie, coördinator zorgprogramma ouderen van een huisartsengroep en casemanager), onderzocht welke governance er volgens betrokken actoren nodig is om de vanuit regionale dementienetwerken georganiseerde zorg effectief te kunnen organiseren.
Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat er geen eenduidige governance is van de regionale dementienetwerken en dat deze governance in de regel als negatief ervaren wordt. Hieraan ligt ten grondslag dat: de structuur van de netwerken vaak niet helder en daarnaast ineffectief is, de netwerken veelal niet als hecht gezien worden, de netwerken niet de juiste samenstelling van leden hebben en de leden te weinig commitment en eigenaarschap tonen. Bovendien heeft niet ieder netwerk doelen vastgesteld dan wel geprioriteerd en zijn deze doelen vaak niet meetbaar. Daarnaast worden successen van de netwerken onvoldoende gedeeld en gevierd. Volgens betrokken actoren is er dan ook"

Hoewel Hijras al duizenden jaren bestaan en tijdens het Mogolrijk belangrijke functies vervulden als loyale beschermers van de harems, zijn ze in het huidige India een gemarginaliseerde gemeenschap. Deze geschiedenis van criminalisering vindt zijn oorsprong in de negentiende eeuw toen de Britten hun kolonie stichtten in voormalig Brits-Indië. Doordat de Hijra-gemeenschap werd gezien als een mislukte vorm van mannelijkheid en daardoor een bedreiging vormde voor het Britse autoritaire gezag, werd repressieve koloniale wetgeving ingevoerd die de gemeenschap verder uit het straatbeeld verdreef. Nadat India in 1947 onafhankelijk was geworden, had het hindoenationalisme inmiddels flink aan terrein gewonnen en kwamen Hijras voor nieuwe uitdagingen te staan in een politiek klimaat dat werd gedomineerd door extreemrechtse partijen. Hoewel Hijras de afgelopen jaren meer rechten hebben gekregen, waaronder het recht om te stemmen en in 2014 officieel zijn erkend als derde gender, blijft de gemeenschap ernstig gediscrimineerd. Het doel van deze studie is om door middel van een langdurige primaire bronnenanalyse inzicht te geven in het verband tussen het Britse imperialisme uit de negentiende eeuw en genderongelijkheid met betrekking tot de Hijras in het huidige India. Dit onderzoek bestaat uit een analyse van berichtgeving over de Hijra-gemeenschap in Indiase kranten tussen het koloniale en postkoloniale tijdperk, waardoor een beeld kan worden gevormd hoe genderongelijkheid en gender transgressie zich in India hebben ontwikkeld."
Van zwart naar groen of naar nog zwarter? Een sociaalhistorische analyse van de transitie naar ander werk na de Limburgse mijnsluiting.,"['Samuels, Lieke']","['Marin, Irina']",2023-07-04T00:01:08Z,NL,['De-industrialisatie; Mijnsluiting; Civic Community; Zuid-Limburg'],Geschiedenis van Politiek en Maatschappij,"In deze thesis is aan de hand van het model van Outcome Based Evaluation van Schalock en de theorie van civic communites van Putnam geanalyseerd waarom de transitie naar ander werk na sluiting van de Limburgse mijnen zo onsuccesvol heeft uitgepakt voor een groot deel van de voormalige mijnwerkers, ondanks het gemaakte beleid en de genomen acties.  Het antwoord op deze vraag blijkt veelvoudig te zijn. De kern van het onsuccesvolle verloop is naar mijn inziens dat de betekenis van het mijnleven en de impact van de mijnsluiting voorafgaand en tijdens de sluiting niet volledig is begrepen en erkend door de beleidsmakers. De beleidsmakers hebben niet gerealiseerd dat het werken in de mijnen niet simpelweg een baan was, maar een hele eigen manier van leven in een hechte civic community met alle normen, waarden, regels en activiteiten van dien. Deze blinde vlek van beleidsmakers heeft ertoe geleid dat de focus in het beleid enkel lag bij het regelen van vervangend werk en de rest als bijzaak werd gezien; er was geen aandacht voor zelfwaarde- en statusverlies, er werd geen ondersteuning geboden voor de overgang naar werk met een hele ander structuur en hiërarchie, de allesomvattende rol van de mijnzetel en de kerk werd niet opgevangen, het verenigingsleven werd niet doorgezet en voor velen werd bepaald dat ze voortaan in een hele andere regio zouden moeten werken. Daarbij werden de mijnwerkers ook niet gemotiveerd om mee te denken of hun input te leveren voor het beleid. Alle verantwoordelijkheid – en tevens alle vertrouwen – lag bij de mijnzetels, de vakbond en de landelijke overheid. Bij deze partijen heerste echter een onvoorwaardelijk enthousiasme waardoor kritisch geluid, strenge regels en een lange termijnvisie ontbraken. Dit resulteerde de eerste jaren van de sluiting in een versneld en chaotisch verloop en in een lege geldkas. De jaren die volgden bestonden vooral uit het beperken van schade en bijsturen van beleid in het mitst van een economische crisis, waar niet op was geanticipeerd. Pas wanneer lokale partijen en initiatieven werden betrokken bij de totstandkoming en uitvoering van het beleid, ging het weer de goede kant op met de voormalige mijnregio. De sterke civic community en het vertrouwen in de overheid is echter nooit volledig hersteld."
Tot stilstand.

Daarnaast hebben leerlingen de uitdaging zich te verhouden tot en om te gaan met de huidige beeldcultuur. Het kunstonderwijs kan hen nieuwe perspectieven laten ontdekken en aanzetten tot reflectie. Leerlingen vinden echter weinig aansluiting bij de kunstvakken. Videokunst zou kunnen aansluiten bij de leefwereld en hen tegelijkertijd vertragen en scherpen. De vraag die aan de basis ligt van dit onderzoek is: Hoe kan videokunst in het kunstonderwijs van waarde zijn om leerlingen in de bovenbouw van het voortgezet onderwijs aan te zetten tot het leren denken over hun positie in en verhouding tot hun leefwereld?
Het onderzoek bestaat uit een literatuur- en casestudie binnen een kunstfilosofisch en -historisch kader. Tevens wordt er een didactisch kader gegeven voor het leren denken door videokunst. Door gebruik van een filmstill in videokunst kan de toeschouwer worden stilgezet. Dit zorgt ervoor dat de eigen beelden overvloeien in het werk: de activatie van de toeschouwer tot ‘beelddenken’. De videowerken Island (2008), Gray Glass (2020) en Countenance (2002) van Fiona Tan tonen dat verstilde beelden de toeschouwer tot denken kunnen zetten. De didactische principes, het vertragen van het kijken en dialogisch leren, geven kunstdocenten een basis om leerlingen aan de hand van videokunst tot denken en reflecteren te stimuleren.  
Dit onderzoek toont aan dat het verstilde videobeeld een tegenkracht biedt in de huidige beeldcultuur. Ze biedt een ontmoeting met de leefwereld terwijl ze tegelijkertijd de ruimte schept voor reflectie op identiteit en op de pluriformiteit van de wereld. Door in het kunstonderwijs deze ruimte te faciliteren biedt zij leerlingen een veilige plek om tot gezamenlijk denken te komen en zo te bouwen aan persoonsvorming."
Muscles and Mascara: The Role of Emphasised Femininity in Female Bodybuilding,"['Dempsey, Lizzie']","['Hossain, Adnan']",2023-07-04T00:01:01Z,EN,"[""Bodybuilding; female bodybuilding; emphasised femininity; women's sport; femininity; compulsive heterosexuality; heteronormativity; sports;""]",Gender Studies,"The building of extreme muscle has the potential to empower women and transgress binary gender norms. However, women who build face significant barriers in the sport due societal expectations associated with ‘femininity’. This thesis provides an in-depth analysis of the construction of ‘femininity’ in the West and its role in constraining, limiting, and marginalising women’s experiences in sport. The influence of ‘femininity’ as a restrictive factor within the context of female bodybuilding will be examined, specifically focusing on the International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness (IFBB) as a case study. Theories of gender, sexuality, and race will be applied throughout this research to conceptually uncover how they are framed within the organisation of the sport. This research finds the federation to be heavily influenced by capitalist and patriarchal priorities, which seek to recast the hyper-muscular woman to fit into a marketable and socially appropriate image of woman, thus, limiting female muscularity. This ‘recasting’ is enforced through a combination of regulations that require the emphasis of feminine characteristics and a limitation of female muscle. An intersectional lens is applied to this research to illustrate how the IFBB promotes a White, heterosexual, and able-bodied ideal of woman. This thesis concludes with the argument that, despite its transgressive potential regarding the development of female strength and muscle, female bodybuilding is another sport that reproduces a very narrow definition of ‘femininity’."

Een ambivalente situatie. De Nederlandse regering wilde richting het volk duidelijk laten zien dat er een grote schadevergoeding werd geëist. De internationale context en de economische afhankelijkheid van Duitsland maakte dit ingewikkeld. Als schadevergoeding niet mogelijk was, moest een vergoeding in grondgebied volgen. Dit staat haaks op de nauwe handelsrelatie die Nederland en Duitsland door de geschiedenis heen met elkaar deelden. Beide economieën waren sterk afhankelijk van elkaar. Dit onderzoek beschrijft het beleid van de Nederlandse regering met betrekking tot het Ruhrgebied in de eerste jaren na de Tweede Wereldoorlog en hoe dit werd beïnvloed door zowel interne als externe factoren. De Nederlandse roep om vergelding maakte geleidelijk plaats voor beleid gericht op economisch herstel van beide landen."
Villa's in het groen; villa projectontwikkeling in Velp in de periode 1880-1914.,"['Kronnie, Linde te']","['Walda, Minke']",2023-07-04T00:00:58Z,EN,[],Kunstgeschiedenis,"In dit onderzoek is de bijdrage van projectontwikkelaars in het ontstaan van het architectonische villalandschap van Velp in de periode 1880-1914 onderzocht.
In het eerste hoofdstuk wordt ingegaan op de ruimtelijke en maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen die hebben geleid tot de bouw van veel villa's in Velp in de negentiende eeuw. Factoren zoals de aanwezigheid van landgoederen, groeiend binnenlands toerisme, bevolkingsgroei, stijgende welvaart voor de hogere middenklasse en verbeterde infrastructuur hebben Velp aantrekkelijk gemaakt voor vestiging door de hogere middenklasse.
Het tweede hoofdstuk richt zich op de betrokken partijen bij de projectontwikkeling van de vele villa's in Velp. Verschillende partijen waren betrokken bij de projectontwikkeling in Velp, waaronder ontwerpende aannemers, externe investeringsmaatschappijen, naamloze vennootschappen en lokale ondernemers. Sommige projectontwikkelaars huurden aannemers in en droegen het financiële risico, terwijl anderen zelf bouwden.
In het derde hoofdstuk wordt de architectuur die door projectontwikkelaars werd toegepast onderzocht. Uit het onderzoek naar de panden in Velp blijkt dat projectontwikkelaars verschillende architecturale stijlen hanteerden en zich snel aanpasten aan stilistische ontwikkelingen. Kenmerken zoals representatieve ruimtes, bijvoorbeeld de hal en en-suitekamers, en de relatie met de natuur, waren constanten in de villa’s die door projectontwikkelaars gebouwd zijn tussen 1880 en 1914."
Rollend naar de toekomst of langzaam ten onder,"['Esch, Manon van']","['Hoeijmakers, Resie']",2023-07-13T00:01:59Z,NL,['Toekomstbestendigheid; bowlen; sociale uitwisselingstheorie; institutionele theorie'],Sportbeleid en sportmanagement,"De sportverenigingen in Nederland worden geconfronteerd met ledendalingen en een tekort aan vrijwilligers. Ook de bowlingverenigingen in Nederland hebben te maken met deze ledendaling. Ze hebben in vier jaar tijd een derde van hun leden verloren. Vergrijzing, een groeiend aantal migranten en individualisering worden genoemd als oorzaken van deze daling. Deze trends zullen naar verwachting leiden tot verdere afname van het aantal leden in de toekomst. Om de toekomstbestendigheid van de sportverenigingen te waarborgen, stimuleert de overheid hen om hun sportaanbod te verbreden en te professionaliseren via het Sportakkoord ll. Er wordt echter aangenomen in het Sportakkoord ll, dat het aanbod onvoldoende zou aansluiten bij de veranderende behoeften van leden. Er is weinig bekend over de daadwerkelijke behoeften van leden en of deze wel veranderd zijn. Dit onderzoek gaat hier dieper op in en beoogt een antwoord te geven op de onderzoeksvraag: ‘In hoeverre zijn de bowlingverenigingen bezig met het vervullen van de behoeften van hun leden, in hoeverre verhoudt dit zich tot de institutionele druk die bowlingverenigingen ervaren en op welke elementen moet de bowlingvereniging inspelen om toekomstbestendiger te zijn?’ Het doel is om inzicht te krijgen in welke mate verenigingen bezig zijn met het vervullen van de behoeften van leden of reageren op de ervaren institutionele druk, en wat dit betekent voor de toekomstbestendigheid. 

Om meer inzicht te krijgen in de toekomstbestendigheid van de bowlingvereniging is er gekeken naar de sociale uitwisselingstheorie en de institutionele theorie. De sociale uitwisselingstheorie stelt dat verenigingen in moeten spelen op de behoeften van hun leden om een sterke relatie op te bouwen. De institutionele theorie stelt dat de verenigingen moeten inspelen op de institutionele druk uit hun omgeving zodat zij hun toekomstbestendigheid vergroten. Deze theorieën zijn getoetst in een veldonderzoek om tot een antwoord te komen op de onderzoeksvraag. Dit veldonderzoek is uitgevoerd door middel van een meervoudige casestudie bij drie bowlingverenigingen. Bij elke vereniging zijn semigestructureerde interviews afgenomen met bestuurders en leden. 

Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de bestuurders van de bowlingverenigingen beseffen dat zij moeten inspelen op de behoeften van leden om toekomstbestendig te zijn. Zij herkennen de behoeften van leden die sportmogelijkheden en gezelligheid terug willen krijgen in ruil voor hun contributie. Hoewel de bowlingverenigingen de behoeften van leden deels herkennen en activiteiten organiseren, lijken de leden minder betrokken bij de vereniging dan verwacht op de sociale uitwisselingstheorie waardoor deze niet volledig aansluit. Verder blijkt uit de resultaten dat de bowlingverenigingen de institutionele druk herkennen vanuit het bowlinghuis en de maatschappelijke trend vergrijzing. Andere institutionele druk lijken de bowlingverenigingen niet te herkennen waardoor zie ook niet de relevantie om hierop in te spelen. De bowlingverenigingen lijken dus meer belang te hechten aan het vervullen van de leden behoeften en richten zich minder op de institutionele druk. Dit kan verklaard worden vanuit de institutionele logica die heerst binnen de bowlingverenigingen. 

Op basis van bovenstaande inzichten zijn enkele aanbevelingen geformuleerd. Ten eerste is het aan te raden dat de bowlingverenigingen blijven inspelen op de behoeften van hun huidige leden om deze te behouden. Ten tweede is het aan te bevelen dat de bowlingverenigingen meer aandacht hebben voor hun omgeving, zodat kunnen reageren op de institutionele druk. Ten derde kunnen de bowlingverenigingen nieuwe flexibelere sportactiviteiten aanbieden met minder verplichtingen. Tot slot wordt ook aanbevolen dat de bowlingverenigingen gebruik kunnen maken van een digitale vorm van de bowlingcompetitie."

Dit doen zij doormiddel van vitaliteitsprogramma’s op de werkvloer. Om resultaat te boeken op de DI is participatie van medewerkers in deze programma’s noodzakelijk. Uit de literatuur is gebleken dat er nog te weinig bekend is over de betekenissen van medewerkers aan vitaliteitsprogramma’s en wat hen motiveert en demotiveert om te participeren. In deze studie is hier onderzoek naar gedaan bij een bestaande, anonieme organisatie (genoemd: VitalityBank), waar het programma HelloWellbeing is uitgerold. 
Methode: Deze kwalitatieve, interpretatieve studie heeft zich gericht op de betekenissen die medewerkers toekennen aan het vitaliteitsprogramma op de werkvloer, en wat motiverende- en demotiverende factoren voor hen waren om te participeren. De data is verzameld doormiddel van literatuurstudie, observaties en semigestructureerde interviews bij vijf deelnemers en vijf niet-deelnemers aan het programma HelloWellbeing. Aan de hand van de drie psychologische basisbehoeften autonomie, competentie en verbondenheid uit de self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci, 2000), zijn de motiverende- en demotiverende factoren, benoemd door medewerkers, geïnterpreteerd en geanalyseerd. 
Resultaten: De betekenissen die door medewerkers toegekend werden aan vitaliteit waren uiteenlopend, maar allen positief: fysieke- en mentale gezondheid, lekker in je vel zitten, sporten en bewegen, zin hebben om dingen te doen, werk-privé balans, veerkracht, voeding en jezelf in de hand houden. Als belangrijkste motiverende- en demotiverende factoren om te participeren die ervaren werden door medewerkers, werd gevonden: 
- de behoefte aan plezier in sportactiviteiten en het gebrek hieraan in HelloWellbeing; 
- de negatieve invloed van een laag zelfbeeld/zelfvertrouwen op participatie voor minder-sportieve medewerkers.
- de bevorderende werking van gezamenlijk sporten maar het gebrek aan verbinding tussen collega’s om dit daadwerkelijk te doen.
- het belang van communicatie rondom het programma en de behoefte aan duidelijke afspraken rondom deelname aan de lessen. 
Aanbevelingen: Op basis van de belangrijkste resultaten uit het onderzoek zijn er aanbevelingen gedaan aan VitalityBank om de participatie aan het vitaliteitsprogramma te bevorderen. Dit omvat het toevoegen van een plezier-aspect aan de sportlessen en het creëren van laagdrempelige activiteiten voor niet-sportende medewerkers. Het stimuleren van verbinding tussen collega's kan worden bereikt door sport- en beweegchallenges en teambuildingactiviteiten te organiseren, gekoppeld aan het vitaliteitsprogramma. Het belang van overzichtelijke communicatie en duidelijke regels met betrekking tot deelname aan het programma wordt benadrukt, samen met het bieden van ruimte voor feedback en inspraak van medewerkers. Ook wordt aanbevolen afspraken per afdeling binnen VitalityBank te maken over sporten onder werktijd om de participatie aan het programma te verhogen."

alternative strategies that can effectively support individuals' mental health.
The aim of this study is to investigate the potential impact of social participation on a person's mental 
health, mediated by having a social support network. To achieve this aim, data from the Longitudinal 
Internet studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel were utilized. The sample consisted of 4884 
respondents, providing a diverse representation of the Dutch population. A regression analysis was 
conducted to examine whether the relationship between social participation and mental health, mediated 
by the presence of a social support network. 
The results of the study revealed that participation in an organization had an indirect contribution 
to positive mental health outcomes through the effect of having social support networks. This suggests 
that engaging in volunteering or community activities can foster the development of social connections, 
which in turn support individuals' mental well-being. However, the direct and total effects of social 
involvement on mental health were not found to be significant.
These findings have important implications for Dutch policies and initiatives aimed at 
addressing mental health challenges and alleviating the burden on mental health services. By 
recognizing the potential benefits of social participation and the role of social support networks, 
policymakers can develop targeted interventions that promote community engagement and social 
connections. This can involve creating opportunities for volunteering, supporting community activities, 
and facilitating the establishment of social support networks."

In de thesis is gebruik gemaakt van de cross-sectionele dat van PISA 2018 in Nederland. Het past een multipele regressieanalyse toe om de invloed van het disciplinair klimaat, de samenwerking tussen leerlingen en de steun van de leraar op het gevoel van verbondenheid met school te onderzoeken. De resultaten tonen aan dat deze sociale aspecten positief significant bijdragen aan het gevoel van verbondenheid met school. Bovendien blijkt dat het effect van het disciplinair klimaat op het gevoel van verbondenheid versterkt wordt door de aanwezigheid van een migratieachtergrond. Dit benadrukt het belang van een positieve en ondersteunende leeromgeving, waarin regels worden gehandhaafd, leerlingen worden gestimuleerd om samen te werken en leraren hen ondersteunen. Voor leerlingen met een migratieachtergrond is het handhaven van een positief disciplinair klimaat met name belangrijk om acculturatiestress en discriminatie te verminderen. Hoewel sociale relaties belangrijk blijven voor alle leerlingen, werkt het niet versterkend voor leerlingen met een migratieachtergrond. Dit kan mogelijk verklaart worden door de culturele afstand die deze leerlingen ervaren. De beperkingen van dit onderzoek liggen in het cross-sectionele karakter, de operationalisering van de variabelen en het gebrek aan aandacht voor culturele competenties. Toekomstig longitudinaal onderzoek dat deze beperkingen adresseert en rekening houdt met de culturele samenstelling van de klas, is waardevol. Beleidsadviezen voor de leraren, beleidsmakers in het onderwijs, de gemeente en het NJi vraagt om het benadrukken van de socialiserende functie van het onderwijs, om inclusie te bevorderen van leerlingen met een migratieachtergrond."

Este trabajo pretende demostrar la importancia de editar e investigar esos epistolarios en una sociedad que ya no escribe cartas. Esta investigación formula una respuesta a la pregunta de la relevancia histórica, social y literaria de investigar y editar correspondencias epistolares inéditas entre autores, conservadas en archivos. Elaboramos el valor añadido de la edición y el papel del editor, antes de aplicarlo a un estudio de caso sobre el epistolario de Rosa Chacel y Pere Gimferrer. Transcribimos y editamos esas cartas y también elaboramos un manual paso a paso para futuros investigadores. Esta investigación demuestra que investigar y editar cartas tiene una gran relevancia histórica y social, especialmente para las generaciones más jóvenes, que corren el riesgo de sentirse ajenas a la historia reciente de España y corren el peligro de caer en el olvido. Al sumergirse en textos tan personales como las cartas, se sienten más conectados emocionalmente con lo sucedido y también pueden sentir una mayor comprensión hacia situaciones políticas similares que ocurren en el mundo actual. Este trabajo también demuestra la relevancia literaria de la investigación y edición de epistolarios. Las cartas ofrecen una visión entre bastidores de lo que era para un autor intentar publicar sus obras en una época de censura. Además, la publicación de las cartas editadas puede generar un renovado interés por la obra de los corresponsales, lo que puede llevar a la publicación de nuevas ediciones de sus libros."

financial problems. However, many people do not access debt help offer by municipalities. 
This has negative implications for the financial well-being of self-employed people. Objective: 
Understand the factors that influence the low participation rate of self-employed people in 
municipal debt help. Theory: The influence of financial problems, trust in municipal financial 
services, and self-stigma on financial help are examined to understand self-employed people’s 
financial help-seeking behaviour. Method: Data from the single-wave study ‘On municipal 
debt services for self-employed’ from the LISS panel is used. Logistic regressions are used to 
understand the impact of financial problems, trust and self-stigma on participation in municipal 
debt help. Results: Participation in municipal debt help was not affected by financial problems 
and trust. Self-stigma decreased the participation in municipal debt help. This effects runs 
independently of one’s financial situation. Conclusion and implications: Self-stigma on 
financial help negatively impact the willingness of self-employed people to participate in 
municipal debt help in case of financial difficulties. Knowledge regarding the available 
financial services facilitates the participation in debt help programs. Self-stigma can be reduced 
by creating an environment where people feel comfortable seeking financial help. This can be
achieved by sharing stories of self-employed people who have positive experiences with
municipal debt help on the website of municipalities. Financial knowledge can be increased by
providing accurate and clear information about the available financial services on the website

This effect is referred to as the “welfare/incarceration trade-off”, and the theoretical explanation of it centers around the idea that welfare and incarceration are related in that they are opposing ways of governing the socially marginal. No studies so far have investigated the welfare/incarceration trade-off in the Netherlands, specifically. Using time-series regression, the extent to which there has been an association between the growth and subsequent decline of the Dutch welfare state and changing incarceration rates since 1960 is estimated. Results show an asymmetrical effect. Increasing welfare was found to be associated with decreasing incarceration. Decreasing welfare was also found to be associated with decreasing incarceration, though this effect was weaker. The results thus indicate that a welfare/incarceration trade-off occurred in the Netherlands during times of increasing welfare, but not during times of welfare retrenchment."

However, this increased speed comes with the cost of reduced accuracy and higher standard deviations, as well as overall higher UI values. The main drawback is its struggle to recognize and distinguish cells in non-optimal images in which the leaf is in a higher state of decay. By training the image-recognition algorithm more extensively it should improve its ability to be able to recognize epidermal cell outlines more precisely and have less trouble with fossil leaves in a higher state of decay. Once the GraVis program has been improved upon, it will become possible to study inner leaf variation which can pick up deviations within the leaf in order to provide data with higher certainty and resolution. More research and data is needed to further improve the GraVis program, but it already provides promising results as of now. 
Using UI analysis of core SN22 and age depth correlation, the climate shifts during the last 600 years can be reconstructed. Core SN22 displays UI variation over time, with relatively high UI values at the start and end of the core. The UI values are the highest at the most recent part of the core, dated to the last 30 years. This is complimentary to the vast amount of studies done on the warming climate on Svalbard over the last couple of decades.  The relatively low UI values between 1500 and 1800 coincide with the Little Ice Age. The strong increase in UI values during the last 30 decades of the core represent the recent warming of the surface temperatures at Svalbard in recent years, and it is predicted that the UI values will keep increasing in the following years.
Further research can be done by coring in different locations of Svalbard while using the same GraVis analysis method to expand the dataset across Svalbard. Alternatively, more cores from the same locations could be studied to expand the age-range of the current dataset to further back into the Holocene and to improve resolution of the currently available data."
Estimating the potential of small reservoir construction and groundwater pumping to reduce water stress and adapt to climate change for smallholder farmers in Senegal,"['Hoogeveen, Anna']","['Hoch, Jannis']",2023-07-20T00:02:36Z,EN,['Senegal; Irrigation; PCR-GLOBWB; Hydrology; Reservoirs; Groundwater pumping; Drought; Hydrological modeling; Hyper-resolution modeling; Food security; MODFLOW'],Earth Surface and Water,"In the past decades, Senegal has faced numerous droughts, and the frequency of these droughts is expected to increase due to the effects of climate change. Consequently, a large part of the population experiences food insecurity, as 70\% of the population relies on agriculture for their livelihood. To mitigate this problem, the construction of small reservoirs and groundwater pumping may offer a solution to increase water availability in the agricultural sector. This study aimed to identify suitable locations for reservoirs with dam heights of 3, 4, and 5 meters and an areal density of one reservoir per 5x5 or 10x10 cells in Senegal. The impact on water availability was modeled using the global hydrology model PCRGLOB-WB 2 at a spatial resolution of 30 arcseconds, incorporating new local datasets. Groundwater pumping was integrated to evaluate the combined effect on water availability using a two-layer groundwater model based on MODFLOW.

The results revealed that reservoirs with a dam height of 4 meters and an areal density of one reservoir per 5x5 cells show the greatest potential for enhancing water availability, particularly in the regions of Ziguinchor, Sédhiou, Kolda, and Kédougou. In the Fatick, Kaolack, and Kaffrine regions, the simulated impact of reservoir irrigation on increasing water availability was minimal, but the potential may increase with modifications in the modeling set-up. Furthermore, renewable groundwater resources have the capacity to fully meet irrigation demand in all of these regions, as well as in Tambacounda. However, tackling water availability alone does not fully solve the constraints on food security. Other factors such as water quality, soil degradation, market access, and investments in small-scale irrigation systems are also significant considerations."

SAURON: Leveraging Semantically Similar Utterances to Enhance Writing Style Embedding Models,"['Koornstra, Tim']","['Nguyen, Dong']",2023-07-20T00:02:19Z,EN,['transformers;AI;Machine Learning;Natural Language Processing;Artificial Intelligence;RoBERTa;writing style;style;representation;representation learning'],Artificial Intelligence,"This thesis investigates the potential for enhancing transformer-based models, widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP), for the task of writing style representation. I propose a novel approach wherein a RoBERTa model (Liu et al., 2019) is trained on the Contrastive Authorship Verification (CAV) task using semantically similar utterances. These are pairs of utterances that encapsulate the same semantic information but differ in their stylistic expression. This methodology encourages the model to concentrate more on style rather than content, fostering a more discerning representation of stylistic nuances. The training data comprised a broad array of conversations from the online platform Reddit, providing a wide representation of authorship and topics.

To assess the performance of the models, the STyle EvaLuation (STEL) framework (Wegmann and Nguyen, 2021) was utilized. The results of the STEL evaluation helped ascertain the models’ ability to accurately capture writing style and delineate the impact
of introducing semantically similar pairings. While incorporating semantically similar utterances greatly improved performance
over models without any form of content control, it was discovered that relying solely on semantically similar utterances was not the most efficient approach. Instead, the findings suggested that a combination of this technique with conversation-based sampling of examples could further enhance the models’ performance. Additionally, the research underlined various effective strategies for preparing input data, such as maintaining diversity in authorship and topics.

The final model, coined as the SAURON (Stylistic AUthorship RepresentatiON) model, considerably improved upon previous iterations. This advancement contributes to the advancement of style-content disentanglement tasks and paves the way for more nuanced and robust style representations."

However, using AI in decision making tasks has not been without flaws, as researchers warn that blindly trusting AI could prove to have major adverse effects for humans. This is due to bias in AI, described as a prejudice of favoritism toward certain subjects, even if they are rationally unjustified. Examples range from university rankings to recidivism tests, where using AI resulted in damaging effects and perpetuation of bias. As a consequence, legislators over the world have introduced new acts to ensure transparency, explainability and fairness in AI, like the recent EU AI act and GDPR. To support this, the field of Responsible AI has set out to make AI more transparent and fair. However, we saw a gap in the current state of the art in fairness assessment toolkits. Researchers urgently called for the creation of a methodology in assisting users with fairness due to its complexity and context dependency. That is why we created this toolkit, in which users are automatically guided by interactive questions on selecting the most suitable model and fairness criteria for a given task, all openly and freely available in JASP. This methodology was created by identifying characteristics of fairness measures, creating a decision tree whose internal nodes composed of interactive questions, mutating this tree and generating candidate trees and subsequently evaluating the trees to select the best one. With this toolkit we hope the help the effort on making AI more transparent and fair."
A right to try psychedelics? An ethical evaluation of compassionate use of psychedelics for psychiatric disorders.,"['Hop, Jessa']","['Verweij, Marcel']",2023-07-20T00:02:22Z,EN,['Bioethics; Compassionate use; Expanded access; Psychedelics; Psychiatric Disorders'],Applied Ethics,"[""""Psychedelics are increasingly studied as treatment options for psychiatric disorders, showing
promising results. However, official approval of most psychedelic treatments is not expected in 
the near future. Given the significant prevalence and impact of psychiatric disorders, the 
question arises whether certain individuals should have access to psychedelic treatment before 
official approval. This is called compassionate use, which allows patients with unmet medical
needs access to unauthorized drugs for their potential therapeutic benefits. Nevertheless, 
compassionate use raises ethical concerns regarding safety and effectiveness, autonomous 
decision-making, equal access and hindering of efficient research processes. These concerns are 
further amplified when considering the unique aspects of psychedelics and psychiatric 
disorders. Therefore, this thesis explores whether compassionate use of psychedelics for 
psychiatric disorders is ethically justified, and if so, under what conditions. Firstly, the ethical
considerations associated with compassionate use in general are examined, resulting in a moral 
framework. Subsequently, relevant characteristics of psychedelics and psychiatric disorders are 
described. By combining the general moral framework with these specific characteristics, it is 
argued that the compassionate use of psychedelics for psychiatric disorders is ethically justified

Yet, commercial deployment of CDR technologies is limited, and establishing a global CDR market is vital to secure funding for scaling the industry. The Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) framework is a theoretical approach to understand socio-technical change, highlighting the importance of technological innovation and the interactions between actors and their networks within an institutional context. This research maps the structure of the TIS at an EU level and analyses the performance of seven TIS functions, with a particular emphasis on market formation [F5] for CDR; an intangible product. This function is expanded by examining two existing carbon market mechanisms, the voluntary and compliance carbon markets, to understand their impact on the development of a market for intangible products. Various CDR actors, including CDR companies, policymakers, networks, experts, journalists, niche market actors, and municipalities, were interviewed and a separate survey was conducted. The results showed that the CDR TIS is currently in a formative phase, where start-ups are focused on R&D and technology demonstrations, scientific uncertainties exist, and private funding and voluntary demand play a significant role. The TIS is influenced by both soft institutions and hard institutions. While soft institutions are crucial in driving private governance and voluntary demand in the early phase, there is a strong desire for market formation mechanisms governed by hard institutions. Different opinions exist on how to establish compliance carbon markets, indicating a lack of consensus and common understanding in the CDR space. The application of the TIS framework to assess the diffusion CDR technologies in this research emphasises the need to understand the dynamics of market formation for intangible products. The study incorporates the concept of private governance alongside the TIS framework, recognizing its role in the formation of a voluntary market for CDR. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of fast-moving soft institutions in early market development and the need to synergize different strands of theory for effective industry creation. In conclusion, the voluntary carbon market, governed by soft institutions, has played a significant role in the early development of the CDR industry. However, compliance market formation mechanisms, governed by hard institutions, are necessary for long-term growth. Overall, a combination of soft and hard institutions is crucial for market formation and diffusion of CDR technologies."
Roadblocks of Polarization - Mechanisms of Cultural Resistance to a Speed Limit on German Highways,"['Grünwald, Lotte']","['Patterson, James']",2023-07-25T00:01:33Z,EN,[],Sustainable Development,"Culture and identity are increasingly recognized as shaping the acceptance of national climate policy and thereby the opportunities, challenges, and dynamics of achieving ambitious climate action. One of the main strands exploring the role of culture and identity in climate action is a perspective that views culture as potentially disruptive to effective climate policy implementation, with the contentious dynamic of polarization as a potential threat to collective climate action. However, the specific mechanisms linking polarization and climate policy resistance remain understudied, despite their inquiry being needed to help understand precisely how cultural resistance to climate policy arises. A particular gap presently exists in the literary canon with respect to the affective, cultural, and societal underpinnings of polarization contributing to opposition towards climate policies that are designed to address automotive emissions and mobility. The research objective of this thesis therefore is to deepen the understanding of the role of culture as a potentially disruptive factor to climate policy implementation in the automotive sector by empirically investigating how theoretically grounded causal mechanisms between polarization and policy resistance manifest in the case of the German highway speed limit opposition, and by drawing implications of those findings for the cultural dimensions of resistance to automotive climate policy more broadly. Three mechanisms are proposed based on existing theory and subsequently empirically studied through a communication-focused application of theory-testing process-tracing. Precisely, the mechanisms’ relevance and manifestations are investigated by analyzing the rationales provided in the context of public statements by politicians, media outlets and private citizens through which resistance to the highway speed limit is justified.

The results show that studying causal mechanisms can help generate valuable insights into cultural resistance to climate policy by enabling a focused analysis of the ways in which cultural factors such as polarization might causally contribute to opposition to specific policy measures. In the case of the German speed limit debate, responses to suspicions of untruthful policy intentions and reactions to divergent preferences for optimal levels of governmental behavioral regulation seem to hold most pertinence in explaining how polarization influences policy resistance. The obtained insights thereby particularly indicate that climate policy resistance should be studied in a multi-mechanism way to account for the coexistence of different mechanisms and the complexity of factors contributing to policy responses. Additionally, the fact that some of the empirically observed mechanisms are surprising indicates that cultural dimensions play out in unexpected ways, further enhancing the relevance of their thorough investigation.

The thesis concludes that by delving into the causal mechanisms underlying cultural resistance, potentially using a communication-focused application of process-tracing, researchers and policymakers can enhance their understanding of the dynamics between socio-cultural factors and policy resistance, ultimately contributing to more informed and just approaches to addressing climate change."

experiments, two with single-task regression of RTVR and RCB and one with multi-task regression. Each experiment involved
training a model based on a resnet14t architecture to minimize Batch Monte-Carlo (BMC) loss designed for imbalanced regression.
We evaluated the performance of each model using Spearman’s correlation and Bland–Altman analysis. Spearman’s correlation

The puzzle of (in-)action,"['Prins, Job']","['Runhaar, Hens']",2023-07-25T00:01:14Z,EN,['Sustainability;Nature-inclusive;Agriculture;Dutch dairy;Action;Inaction'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The intensive character of the Dutch agricultural system puts heavy pressure on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Nature-inclusive farming is an extensive approach that can offer farmers a perspective for the future whilst maintaining the value from ecosystems. However, in the dairy sector nature-inclusive farming has a relatively low uptake due to 5 key issues. These are: the lack of a uniform and shared vision (1), missing structural rewards for societal services (2), limited financial action-perspective for farmers (3), narrow knowledge transfer (4) and resistance from the current system (5). Stakeholders can mitigate these barriers by performing key actions. This research investigates the motivation behind stakeholder (in-)action in performing the key actions necessary for promoting nature-inclusive governance systems. In total 13 interviews were conducted with stakeholders ranging from government, market and civil society. The research finds only 2 cases of action opposed to 12 cases of inaction. The first key action that was taken is: creating specific indicators for nature-inclusive farming. Here key performance indicators were implemented on a provincial-level which offer a foundation for formulating concrete goals and aid in quantifying the value of societal services derived from nature-inclusive farming thus increasing farmer’s ability to capture this value in their business models. This therefore helped tackle key issues 1, 2 and 3. The second key action that was taken is: showing the viability of alternative business models by experimentation in practice. Here a project from Urgenda offers farmers discounted prices on nature-inclusive practices (herb-rich grassland) and provides the necessary knowledge to engage with this, therefore stimulating practical cultural change. This thus contributed to tackling key issues 3, 4 and 5. This research concludes that the reasons for inaction are varied but that the existing institutional setting is the most prominent driver of inaction. As the existing institutional setting is reflective of embedded practices from the system, it can be concluded that the agricultural system promotes inaction and thereby reinforces itself. Additionally, there is a pattern in which stakeholders explain their inaction by ascribing it to systemic barriers (key issues) rather than reflect on their own internal motivation or capabilities. This framing reduces the need for individual stakeholders to perform key actions by shifting the focus from individual stakeholders’ responsibility to a more abstract sense of collective responsibility in facilitating systems change."
ViTs vs. CNNs for 3D Medical Image Segmentation: Are Transformers All You Need?,"['Arregui García, Xabier']","['Maspero, Matteo']",2023-07-25T00:01:28Z,EN,[],Medical Imaging,"The influence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) is increasing in the field of medical image segmentation. In recent years, several papers have presented ViT-based architectures that outperform the previously state-of-the-art CNNs (such as nnU-Net). An example of such is the Swin UNet Transformer (or Swin UNETR), which, in combination with a self-supervised pre-training scheme, has outperformed other CNN and ViT-based architectures in multiple segmentation tasks. However, there are certain design and configuration choices that may aid the ViT to achieve this performance. In this paper, we perform an objective comparison between Swin UNETR and U-Net, comparing both networks in an equal resource setting. We explore two downscaling approaches to balance the parameter count of Swin UNETR, making it closer to the U-Net in this aspect. We measure the ViT's performance loss due to downscaling, as well as the gain obtained from using pre-trained weights for the encoder. Additionally, we assess whether residual blocks aid the Swin UNETR or U-Net to obtain superior performance. Our results show that in the framework used in this study, both U-Net and Swin UNETR show comparable results, with the CNN-based network achieving a slightly superior (1%) DSC. The downscaled ViT models show a decrease of 1.4% in DSC, while pre-training improves the outcome of the original Swin UNETR by 1.6%. Residual functionality proves to aid the pre-trained Swin UNETR with an increase of 3.6% in DSC, while only improving U-Net's DSC by 0.8%. In the constrained resource setting of this study, the U-Net proves to obtain similar performance to Swin UNETR, while employing fewer GPU resources and improving inference speed."

Habitat maps are crucial for preserving biodiversity in nature areas, and traditional methods of creating them are costly and time-consuming. Creating habitat maps typically involves high-quality fieldwork, which is expensive and leads to infrequent updates, even though dunes can be highly dynamic. This project focuses on the Dutch National Park Zuid-Kennemerland and addresses the problem of automating the creation of habitat maps by exploring the use of deep learning algorithms and increasing the performance by using hyperparameter tuning. In this research we show that using an annotation tool called doodler and a ResUnet with class weights from segmentation gym performs the most optimal. The habitats demonstrates that the ResUnet model outperforms the segformer and UNet models in classifying sand, grey dunes, white dunes, and shrubs in coastal dune images. However, there are still difficulties in differentiating between grey dunes and white dunes. The use of class weights during training improves overall predictions and reduces tiling issues in the fully predicted image. These findings contribute to the understanding of effective image segmentation techniques for habitat mapping in coastal dune environments in the Netherlands, emphasizing the importance of model selection and the use of class weights for improved performance. We anticipate this thesis to be a starting point in the automation of habitat mapping for coastal dunes. Some hyperparameters like image augmentation can still be tested. Also a popular trend in deep learning for images is transfer learning which might achieve even better results. Furthermore accurately automating this process can save considerate time for researchers who create habitat maps for coastal dunes and makes the tracking of biodiversity within these areas more consistent."

However, there remains a gap in understanding how socio-economic aspects in data analytics applications informs policy and how knowledge from both data analysts and policy makers is integrated in energy transition policy making. To address these gaps the aim of this study is to analyse the use of data analytics applications that support policy making on socio-economic aspects of the local energy transition, taking into account the integration of knowledge from both data analysts and policy makers. Theory: The framework of H. van der Voort et al. (2021) and the associated activities were utilized to analyse how the knowledge integration from data analysts and policy makers in the process of DDPM. Methods: To address the abovementioned gaps, a multiple-case study was conducted of six Dutch municipalities, where two connected data analytics applications used for energy policy making were investigated in each case. The cases were compared using first a within-case analysis and then a cross-case analysis. Results: The extensive collaboration between data analysts and policy makers throughout the process of DDPM enhances their knowledge integration. The knowledge derived from the applications facilitate and inform policy makers by monitoring the energy transition initiatives, and aids in the formulation of effective policies. In addition, socio-economic aspects, such as energy poverty, are increasingly considered in the data analytics applications, enabling policy makers to make informed decisions for prioritization of neighbourhoods for implementing natural gas-free heating, and more targeted measures. However, implementing data analytics applications on socio-economic aspects encounters challenges such as acquiring accurate socio-economic data, integrating social and technical data in a single data analytics application, and privacy concerns. Discussion/Conclusion: It is emphasized that data analytics applications including socio-economic aspects, offer a powerful tool for Dutch municipalities in their pursuit of sustainable energy transitions. By enhancing the knowledge integration from both data analysts and policy makers, utilizing the created knowledge of data analytics applications on socio-economic aspects of the energy transition, and addressing the challenges involved, municipalities can make more informed decisions and promote socio-economic equity, and just transitions. Future research directions in this field are conducting structured literature review and more case studies that include the provincial and national level of government to generate a wider geographical scope of the research."
Cortical Circuit Development: Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors Underlying the Connectivity of Inhibitory Neurons,"['Kapteijns, Troy']","['Gomes da Silva, Carla']",2023-07-27T00:02:27Z,EN,"['Cerebral cortex, Interneurons, Development, Genesis, Migration, Synaptogenesis, Circuits']",Neuroscience and Cognition,"The cerebral cortex is a brain structure that is involved in a variety of complex tasks, such as language, 
learning and reasoning. Many different cell types are involved in the execution of these tasks, including 
excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons. Communication between these neuron types is important, 
because inhibitory neurons regulate the activity of the excitatory neurons. However, the excitatory 
neurons and inhibitory neurons are not born at the same place. While excitatory neurons will reside in 
locations close to the regions where they were born, the inhibitory neurons are required to move in order 
to be able to communicate with excitatory neurons. The processes of inhibitory neuron generation, 
migration and the formation of connections is strictly regulated during different developmental stages.
The inhibitory neurons are generated in a transient embryonic region below the cortex. At different 
locations within this region, different concentrations of proteins are present. These proteins influence 
the type of inhibitory neuron is generated. Furthermore, interneurons can also receive some information 
from their progenitors to become a specific type of interneuron. With maturation, inhibitory neurons
also become responsive to signals that can either attract them or repel them from the cerebral cortex.
The cerebral cortex consists of six layers formed by excitatory neurons. Upon arrival in the cortex, the 
inhibitory neurons undergo a second phase of migration, in which the different kinds of inhibitory 
neurons populate specific layers of the cortex. Usually, too many inhibitory neurons reach their final 
destination. During brain development, a fraction of the inhibitory neurons will be instructed to undergo 
cell death. The remaining inhibitory neurons form connections with excitatory neurons. In this way, a 
network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons is formed. While making connections with excitatory 
neurons, the inhibitory neurons also acquire the properties that are necessary for their functions in the 
cerebral cortex in adulthood. 
Disruptions in any of the steps involved in bringing inhibitory neurons to the cerebral cortex could result 
in disorders such as autism or schizophrenia. Therefore, it is important to understand which mechanisms 
are involved in the regulation of each developmental step. In this review, I provide an overview on 
which factors are involved in the generation of inhibitory neurons, migration and integration in cortical 
layers. Thereby, I hope to advance our understanding of the origin and the development of the networks 
in the cerebral cortex and to contribute to our knowledge of several neurodevelopmental disorders."

The current study investigated whether age is positively related to the number of depressive/anxiety symptoms (hypothesis 1) and whether the positive association of age with the number of depressive/anxiety symptoms is stronger in girls than in boys (hypothesis 2). To test these hypotheses, a symptom-specific approach of the disorders was adopted and associations with individual symptoms were also explored. Data from the “Adolescents at Risk of Anxiety and Depression: A Neurobiological and Epidemiological approach” (ARIADNE) study, consisting of 522 Dutch offspring of patients receiving treatment for depression and/or anxiety disorders, was used. Contrary to expectation, age was not related to the overall number of symptoms and was only related to two specific somatic/sleep symptoms, “I have low energy for no reason” and “I often lie awake for hours before falling asleep”. Unexpectedly, gender did not moderate the association between age and number of symptoms. Overall, the lack of significance may be due to the narrow age range of the sample.

Exploring the Inverse Relationship between Intensity of Meeting Friends and Closeness of Friendships and the Fear of Missing Out","['Boeijen, Janet']","['Ouvrein, Gaëlle']",2023-07-27T00:02:34Z,EN,['Adolescents; secondary school students; fear of missing out; closeness of the friendship; intensity of meeting friends; self-esteem'],Youth Studies,"Previous studies trying to explain the fear of missing out (FoMO) mainly focused on the influence of psychological needs (autonomy, competence and relatedness) in general, while the present study focused on the intensity of meeting friends and the closeness of the friendship separately.  Furthermore, it was tested whether this relationship was affected by self-esteem. In this cross-sectional study, a sample (N= 2632) of 7 and 8 graders (M = 13.94, SD = 1.20) of two secondary schools in the Netherlands from ‘The Digital Youth Project’ (T3) was utilized. It was hypothesized that the intensity of meeting friends and the closeness of the friendship uniquely and interactively (through self-esteem) had a relationship with feelings of FoMO. The findings revealed an association between the closeness of the friendship on FoMO, also partly through self-esteem. However, the intensity of meeting friends did not affect FoMO, neither did the combined effect of the intensity of meeting friends and the closeness of the friendship. Feelings of FoMO are repressed when adolescents have close friendships, also in combination with high self-esteem. The results emphasize the importance of meaningful and intimate friendships, as well as high self-esteem, in adolescents. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed."

Furthermore, the mechanisms driving this relationship are not fully understood. Hence, this study aimed to elucidate the bidirectional relationship between sleep problems and externalizing problem behavior in adolescence and to explore the potential moderating role of socioeconomic status (SES) and mediating role of effortful control in the pathway from sleep problems to externalizing problem behavior. Data from two time points (T1 and T3) of the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS; n = 2,229) were analyzed using (hierarchical) multiple regressions. The results support a reciprocal relationship between sleep problems and externalizing problem behavior. Contrary to expectations, a lower SES did not amplify this relationship, and while effortful control was significantly associated with externalizing problem behavior, it did not explain the relationship between sleep problems at T1 and externalizing problem behavior at T3. The results highlight the intricacy of the link between sleep issues and externalizing problem behavior and call for further investigation into other potential moderators and mediators. Understanding these relationships can contribute to the development of targeted interventions for adolescents experiencing sleep problems and externalizing problem behaviors."
Unraveling the influence of social anxiety on cannabis use among underaged adolescents,"['Ingen, Carlijn van']","['Peeters, Margot']",2023-07-27T00:02:32Z,EN,['Cannabis use; social anxiety; educational level; social exclusion; underaged adolescents'],Youth Studies,"Background and aims: The relationship between social anxiety and cannabis use among young adolescents is unclear. Some indicate a positive relation due to self-medication, while others suggest a negative link influenced by cannabis legislation and social anxiety characteristics. The influence of educational level and social exclusion on the relationship between social anxiety and cannabis use is also understudied. Understanding the factors that influence cannabis use among adolescents is crucial as it can lead to harmful consequences. Therefore, this longitudinal study explores the relationship between social anxiety and cannabis use and the influence of educational level and social exclusion. Method: a multinomial logistic regression was performed over two waves (N=1.818, M=16.3). Results: compared to non-cannabis-using adolescents, those with social anxiety are less inclined to be heavy cannabis users. Additionally, socially excluded adolescents with social anxiety are less likely to engage in experimental cannabis use. Discussion: education level did not affect the young adolescents' cannabis use. Social anxiety and social exclusion can be protective factors for cannabis use due to its characteristics and age-related cannabis legislation. However, these factors can become risky in young adulthood. Healthcare professionals should consider age and potential consequences, offering guidance. Future research should include young adults."
Validity of problem posing as assessment,"['Kuijpers, Rebecca']","['Bos, R.']",2023-07-27T00:02:26Z,EN,"['Validity, Problem posing, assessment']",Science Education and Communication,"This article aims to explore the construct validity of problem posing as an assessment method. The article proposes a framework of factors contributing to the validity of problem posing as assessment. For convergent validity these factors are the complexity of the problem, solvability of the problem and the coverage of the learning goals. For discriminant validity there is only one factor, namely whether the problem covers at least one learning goal. Further, this article explores whether it makes a difference for the validity whether the problem posing task is structured or unstructured. We have analyzed 86 problems posed by 21 secondary education students as part of an advanced mathematics course. The results showed that all previously mentioned factors contribute to the validity of problem posing as an assessment and that taking the students’ answer key into account in assessment contributed to the convergent validity as well. Therefore, the answer key is added to the proposed framework of factors contributing to the validity of problem posing. Furthermore, the problems posed from structured tasks had more diversity in complexity of the problems, allowing the teacher to distinguish the mathematical abilities of students better. Therefore, the structured tasks are more convergent valid than the unstructured tasks. The main implication of the results is that problems posed from structured tasks that are rated on complexity, solvability, students’ answer keys and coverage of the learning goals are a valid way of assessment."

Een rode draad naar erkenning: Het aanzien van textiele werken uit de weefwerkplaats op het Bauhaus van 1919 tot 1931,"['Cobben, Hadewig']","['Bavelaar, Hestia']",2023-08-01T00:01:54Z,NL,['Bauhaus; textiel; vrouwen; feminisme; design; designtheorie; weefkunst; weefwerkplaats; wevers;'],Kunstgeschiedenis,"Recentelijk is er door het feministische discours meer aandacht voor de vrouwen werkzaam op het Bauhaus en voor hun prestaties in de weverij. Er wordt gesteld dat door het patriarchaat de vrouwelijke wevers een minderwaardiger status hadden dan hun mannelijke collega’s op de school. Textiele werken zouden laag in de hiërarchie staan op het Bauhaus en de weverij bevond zich hierdoor in de periferie van de school, stelt de literatuur.  

Toch is de weverij de langst standhoudende werkplaats zijn die erg productief was en namen de wevers veelvuldig deel aan verschillende grote Bauhaus projecten, zoals meubelontwerpen en architectuurontwerpen. Deze feiten stroken niet met het beeld dat wordt geschetst in de literatuur. De vraagstelling luidt hierom als volgt: ’Wat was de houding ten aanzien van het belang van textiele werken uit de weefwerkplaats op het Bauhaus van 1919 tot 1931?’. Deze scriptie onderzoekt welke houding men in het Bauhaus zelf had tegenover het belang van textiele werken op het Bauhaus. 

Als theoretisch kader zijn de fenomenologische design theorie van Mads Nygaard Folkmann en de feministische design benadering van Cheryl Buckley gehanteerd. De benadering van Buckley houdt rekening met het patriarchaat waarin design, ontworpen door vrouwen, is vervaardigd. Vrouwen vervullen in dit patriarchaat een andere rol en hebben een andere positie dan de individuele (mannelijke) kunstenaar. Daarom moet het werk van vrouwen vanuit een ander perspectief worden beoordeeld. Folkmanns methode analyseert de esthetische kwaliteiten van design om te bezien welke zintuigelijk ervaring een designobject veroorzaakt. Vervolgens wordt bestudeerd welk idee een designobject communiceert naar de toeschouwer en gebruiker. Hierdoor kunnen er uitspraken gedaan worden over hoe textiel functioneerde in verschillende contexten en waarom het werd verwerkt in de 'Gesamtkunstwerken’ die tot stand gebracht werden op het Bauhaus. Deze resultaten zijn in verband gebracht met denkbeelden van de wevers en expliciete uitspraken van verschillende directeuren en leermeesters. 

Gebleken is dat de weverij intensief deelnam aan het grote Bauhausprogramma en het sociale leven op de school. Textiel werd ook steeds bewuster verwerkt in architectuur. De architecten zagen de noodzaak in van de verwerking van textiel, waarvan de eigenschappen, zoals textuur, kleur, warme uitstraling, ruimtelijk en geluiddempend effect, een aangename sfeer konden creëren die de sobere en ornamentloze modernistische gebouwen leefbaar maakt. Daarbij leverde de weverij vele prototypes van textiele producten van hoge kwaliteit, die door industriële fabrikanten in productie werden genomen. Hierdoor kon het textiel het ideaal navolgen om de samenleving te dienen met goed design. De wevers hebben hiermee ook een financiële bijdrage geleverd aan de school en bijgedragen aan het vermaarde succes van het Bauhaus.

Deze verdiensten voor het Bauhaus zonden later ook erkend worden door de verschillende directeuren. Zij zagen in hoe essentieel textiel was voor het handelsmerk van het Bauhaus. Erkend moest worden dat zonder textiel en de weverij het Bauhaus in de realisatie van hun idealen minder succesvol geweest zou zijn. De genderpolitiek en de nog minder geëmancipeerde status van de vrouw in de samenleving was dus niet doorslaggevend voor de erkenning van textiele werken."
Sketching the Road to Digital Croquis Making: Thesis Sketch Map Tools for Geography Education,"['Brink, Matthias van den']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-08-01T00:02:47Z,EN,['Sketch map; Croquis; Education; Design Research; Digital sketch map making'],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"Sketch maps or croquis are a tool widely applied in geography research and education. In education, 
the main goals of using sketch maps are geographically structuring information and distinguishing 
between main and side issues. In education, the most important goal of using sketch maps is thus 
training higher cognitive skills: to create new knowledge or information by combining information from 
different sources into one sketch map. A sketch map is used to tell a story, with the map maker 
interpreting information that is told to readers through the map. 
In this research, an attempt is made to find requirements from didacticians, teachers and students 
active in secondary school geography education for creating a digital sketch map making tool. For this 
purpose, theoretical research, focus groups, try outs and coding are applied. 
A first theoretical exploration suggests that sketch maps are an effective tool when used in education. 
From literature, both advantages and disadvantages of hand-drawn of digital methods of sketch map 
making can be found. In the Dutch context, sketch maps are occasionally applied. Using sketch maps 
in education could however be a useful addition to the curriculum, as is for example the case in France.
The results in this research are determined using qualitative data. A total of five didacticians, three 
teachers and 62 (of whom 19 were interviewed) students participated in the research. After 
conducting a focus group with the didacticians, a prototype sketch map making tool was created and 
tested in four different tryout sessions. The created tool was aimed at providing not only basic drawing 
functionality for users to create maps, but also to provide flexibility for users to be able to change and 
correct mistakes made in a sketch map easily. More importantly, the tool provides the possibility for 
teachers to create assignments, which can be opened and used by students. This enables teachers to 
provide the necessary structure to students of different levels, an important prerequisite for sketch 
map making didacticians stressed. In the test, the most important functionality of the tool – being able 
to successfully create sketch maps – seemed to suffice. This meant the users not only saw the relevance 
of digital sketch map making, but also the practicality and the effectiveness of the tool is expected to 
suffice.
Concluding it may be said that in order for the application of digital sketch map making in education, 
it is important that sufficient structure can be provided to students through differentiation. 
Furthermore, it is important for the tool to be easily accessible by everyone. This means the tool should 
be web-based, and drawing should be possible on different kinds of hardware. 
Further research should be aimed at further developing the tool. This requires trying to fix some issues 
with zooming and panning found in the research. Also, more extensive functionality with lower priority 
found in this research may be added to the tool. After a more extensive large-scale field test, more 
definitive results about the quality, relevance, practicality and effectiveness of digital means of making 
sketch map can be provided."

wordt gekozen om voedsel weg te gooien ten behoeve van andere organisationele waardes en 
voedselverbrassing waarbij een onbewuste inefficiëntie zorgt voor voedselverspilling. Deze 
benadering helpt om maatregelen tegen voedselverspilling op te stellen en te evalueren die in lijn

Conclusie is dat voor vijf van de zes coöperaties het organiseren van tegenmacht de belangrijkste motivatie was. Daarnaast zijn er vaak meerdere motieven van toepassing die elk (soms in interactie met andere motieven) een rol spelen. Deze motieven kunnen de oorzaak tot samenwerking zijn, maar ook een gevolg van samenwerking. In dat laatste geval waren ze geen motief bij de start van de coöperatie, maar ‘bijvangst’. Waarbij de binnenvaartcoöperaties de overheidsinterventies nodig hadden om de culturele en praktische bezwaren van potentiële leden tegenwicht te bieden.

The study investigates how household demographics and population dynamics evolved in Dutch new towns. How the changing makeup of households and age demographics affect facilities within new towns. And how the changing makeup of households and age demographics impact new towns' spatial and physical aspects. 

The findings reveal diverse population dynamics, influenced by governmental growth strategies, across new towns. Household sizes have decreased, and the population has aged at a faster rate compared to the Netherlands. The regressions reveal that facilities are influenced by demographic changes. This holds true for both new towns and the entirety of the Netherlands. However, the demographic shifts in new towns are a lot more more substantial.

The abundance of single-family homes and the rapid construction of homes within a condensed timeframe
have resulted in a large influx of a homogeneous population. Consequently, the facilities experience much greater fluctuations in demographics in new towns, leading to a mismatch in facilities, as well as in the physical space.

Overall, this research contributes to understanding the changes in household demographics and their effects on the built environment in Dutch new towns. The findings provide insights for future developments and policy recommendations, enhancing liveability and meeting the needs of changing populations."

The socio-ecological framework helped to better understand that gender norms leading to GBV occur at all system levels. The overlap between levels showed how factors at one level influence factors at another, and that preventing violence requires action at multiple levels. It starts with awareness of how the gender and social norms in which boys are embedded, contributes to GBV.

that the Dutch government and media developed the pre-existing security culture, which was

This study investigates the mediating roles of Psychological Safety (PS), Managerial Innovation Support (MIS), and Psychological Availability (PA) in this relationship.
The study employed a quantitative, cross-sectional, triple-parallel-mediation design. Data from 137 full- or part-time employees was collected using a questionnaire. Participants were primarily young, german and highly educated. Results of the study indicate that IL positively relates to IB. While PS does not intervene, both MIS and PA were found to fully mediate the relationship between IL and IB, providing novel evidence for these specific mediations. Furthermore, exploratory evidence suggests that the mediation via MIS is statistically significantly stronger than via PA while accounting for PS as a covariate. The study provides practical insights, emphasising the importance of nurturing IL for facilitating IB and showcasing effective ways IL can support IB, which should be interpreted against its limitations."

Large Transformer based language models have achieved state-of-the-art in many tasks, and recently have even been able to do this without requiring task specific fine-tuning, by deploying either in-context or zero-shot learning. However, reasoning remains to be a difficult task for these models, especially in a zero-shot setting. On the contrary, humans are good at reasoning without being explicitly trained for it like models are, hinting that properties of human reasoning might be of help to boost the performance of models. We explore this intuition in two ways: (1) using human-like linguistic input for fine-tuning and (2) prompting models to ``imagine"", a technique that has shown to help humans reason better. Our results show that our approach was fruitful for reasoning about fantastical scenarios, which is in line with previous research on humans, confirming that making an analogy between human and artificial reasoning can be helpful. This research opens many doors for future research on zero-shot reasoning, also using smaller models, which is a desirable development towards human-like general intelligence."

It has already been used as carrier for therapeutic delivery and catalytical activity. UiO-67-Pt is one of the well-known metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which have a high surface area, chemical and thermal stability. It also requires a relatively low activation temperature when catalyzing CO2 hydrogenation. The pelletizing and sieving process commonly used for UiO-67-Pt before catalyst testing damages the crystal structure, resulting in decreased catalytic activity. CS-incorporated MOFs are particularly interesting because it can potentially improve the stability of the catalysts by bypassing the pelletize process. This work investigates the use of CS beads as a carrier for UiO-67-Pt in CO2 hydrogenation reactions. One pot synthesis (OPS) and post synthetic functionalization (PSF) methods are used to synthesize CS beads / UiO-67-Pt composites. XRD, ATR-IR, SEM, TGA, and catalyst test are used to characterize the sample. The results show that UiO-67-Pt made by OPS method successfully grows into the CS bead structure, while PSF products only contain low concentrations of UiO-67-Pt and are mainly located on the surface of CS beads. Compared to pure UiO-67-Pt powder, the size of UiO-67-Pt decreases when CS beads are present in the synthesis with a remaining similar crystal structure and chemical composition. When growing UiO-67-Pt inside CS beads, K2PtCl4 can coordinate with the amide group of chitosan from IR results. TGA results show that UiO-67-Pt is stable up to 556 ℃, CS beads are stable up to 290 ℃, but CS beads / UiO-67-Pt composites are only stable up to 240 ℃. Catalyst testing results show that activation at 180 ℃ for 2 hours is not enough to enable CO2 hydrogenation for both UiO-67-Pt and CS beads / UiO-67-Pt composites, while activation at 350 ℃ for 2 hours enables CO2 hydrogenation into carbon monoxide, methanol, and methane."

system, human recipient and domain). Further investigation of human-centred research highlights the
importance of considering both the recipient’s knowledge and goals. Besides, we found that one way to
accomplish this is by creating a question-driven explanation method and visualising the decision-making
process to aid understanding. Accordingly, the proposed explanation method involves representing a decision
model in a graph database to be able to both question and visualise it. This proposed explanation method is
implemented for a real-world scenario, generating tailored explanations for different target groups. The
evaluation highlights the method’s ability to answer specific questions but identifies limitations in handling
logical checks and hypothetical scenarios. Future research can focus on improving these aspects and
exploring additional reasoning properties and customisable interfaces to adapt the method to recipients’

NLI is an important task for evaluating language models' ability to predict the entailment relationship between two sentences, thus showcasing a model's capacity for Natural Language Understanding (NLU). This study predominantly focuses on the BERT-base-uncased model, assessing the effects of enhancing it with an inductive bias toward linguistically derived syntactic trees using Graph Convolutional Networks, and the effects on performance on various NLI benchmark datasets and out-of-domain evaluation sets. While earlier research has delved into the impacts of enhancing LLMs with dependency structures, the effects of incorporating constituency structures and combining both parsing techniques remain largely unexplored. Experimental results reveal that while enhancement of BERT with syntactic structures does not notably benefit generic large-scale NLI datasets, it significantly aids models in scenarios where the underlying syntactic structure is important for the inference task, such as in semi-automatically generated datasets. This is particularly evident when training data is scarce, a common challenge in many real-world applications. Results further show that of the two investigated syntactic structures, constituency structures provide the most benefits in learning representations for monotonicity reasoning, an important skill that requires the ability to capture interactions between lexical and syntactic structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that constituency parsing can help the BERT model learn useful representations for the syntactic structure of passive sentences, an area identified in previous research as a shortcoming of BERT."
Deliberating AI: Why AI in the Public Sector Requires Citizen Participation,"['Dollbo, Anna']","['Klein, Dominik']",2023-08-08T00:01:47Z,EN,"['AI, public sector, democracy, legitimacy, public deliberation']",Artificial Intelligence,"AI is a technology used across different societal domains due to its ability to increase operational efficiency by automating tasks and decision-making. AI is increasingly also applied in the public sector with the aim of making public administration more personalised, lean, and efficient. However, the technological advancement of AI also raises concerns regarding fairness,
transparency, privacy, and human rights. Contrary to the perception of AI as a neutral tool, biases in its use and practices of surveillance suggest that it may have non-neutral impacts. Such impacts raise questions about AI's compatibility with democratic values. This thesis argues that if the use of AI in the public sector fails to uphold democratic values, its legitimacy is called into
question based on democratic principles. The thesis investigates how AI in the public sector can impact the democratic values of equality, justice, and freedom. The investigation shows that AI should be understood as a political technology that risks disrespecting democratic values, raising questions about the legitimacy of its use in the public sector. The theory of deliberative
democracy is employed to propose citizen participation as a way to address this. The thesis proposes the use of public deliberation as a means to determine how citizens would like to be governed by AI."

Mathematical skills are essential for functioning well in society. In recent years, the math performance of students in the Netherlands has decreased, which is why it is important to understand the factors that influence mathematical ability in order to achieve success in math development. Two factors that influence math development are student effort and disruptive classroom behavior. Through factor analysis, effort and disruptive behavior have been combined into one variable “work attitude”. This study examines the extent to which work attitude predicts math performance in grade 7 and whether this predictor continues over time, while controlling for previous math performance. Additionally, the study examines whether the relationship between work attitude and math performance is moderated by gender. The study was conducted using existing data from 330 participants (160 girls and 170 boys) and their teachers. Math ability was measured using the Cito Mathematics test for grade 7 and grade 8. Work attitude was measured using the Cool5-18 questionnaire, which was administered to the participants' teachers. The results of the study show that work attitude is a significant weak positive predictor of math performance. However, work attitude is not a significant predictor of math performance over time after controlling for previous math performance. Previous math performance appears to be a significant strong predictor of later math performance. Furthermore, the relationship between work attitude and math performance is not moderated by gender. Therefore, the focus should be more on previous math performance rather than work attitude."

"The influence of the ladder for sustainable urbanization on the location and nature of housing developments:
a case study on the municipality of Amersfoort","['Visser, Tjeerd']","['Smith, Shaun']",2023-08-11T00:01:51Z,EN,['ladder for sustainable development; ladder voor duurzame verstedelijking; urban development; stedelijke ontwikkeling; spatial urban policy; ruimtelijke beleid; case study; Amersfoort; Dutch; The Netherlands; Nederland; housing development; woningbouwontwikkeling; sustainable urbanization; duurzame verstedelijking'],Spatial Planning,"In the Netherlands, arranging the numerous space claims within the limited space is a considerable challenge. This applies not least in view of the urgent need for housing development. New urban development is inevitable in that context. The ladder for sustainable urbanization is a national legal policy instrument introduced in 2012 to promote efficient land use. However, opinions regarding this policy instrument vary and are often negative. It is argued that the ladder leads to undesirable delays and, particularly for extra-urban housing development, to unnecessarily hinders. This study aims to deepen the understanding of the ladder’s practical implementation by examining its spatial impact on housing developments in the municipality of Amersfoort. Through a qualitative single-case study, data was collected from relevant municipal and provincial policies, as well as interviews with civil servants, project developers, and a spatial planning consultant. Analysis of the data, guided by existing scientific literature, reveals that the location and nature of housing developments are not directly influenced by the ladder but rather are shaped by policy considerations and the feasibility of developers’ business cases. The ladder's principles, such as prioritizing inner-city development, have become common practice in (the implementation of) Amersfoort’s policy. While the ladder primarily functions as a potential punitive measure in legal proceedings, it has not obstructed or canceled housing developments when a thorough pre-process has been followed. Under these conditions, it can be inferred that the ladder indirectly influences the location and nature of housing developments within the municipality of Amersfoort. Although based on a single municipality and limited respondents, this study’s design provides a suitable starting point for comparative research in other municipalities or with a broader range of respondents. Further investigation is needed to position the observed prioritization of inner-city development, particularly in the seemingly contradictory context of the decentralization and deregulation of Dutch national spatial policy over the past decade."
"Place attachment to waterscapes in the Hague, the Netherlands","['Dumitra-Mic, Amelia']","['Frantzeskaki, Niki']",2023-08-11T00:01:53Z,EN,['Place attachment; waterscape; imageability; urban policy.'],Urban and Economic Geography,"Urban waterscapes provide opportunities for transportation, agriculture, as well as for sports, relaxation, and play. Place attachment has been studied in association with residential areas in urban contexts. However, the relationship between urban waterfronts and place attachment has not been established. This study evaluates the psychological and social mechanisms of place attachment, and the role of place attachment for urban policymaking. A theoretical framework incorporating 3 theories, namely cognitive, emotional, and behavioral place attachment, is used. Fifteen detailed in situ and online interviews with residents and ex-residents of the Hague constitute the data collected for this research. The transcribed interviews were analyzed by identifying 9 categories corresponding to the types of place attachment. The categories were discussed in relation to the theoretical framework. The findings show that childhood place memories are crucial for intense and long-lasting place attachment to the seafront of the Hague. This is true especially for the ex-residents, who spent their childhood and teenage years in the Hague, and frequently visited the seafront. Moreover, unique memories associated with strong emotions are greatly impacting place attachment. These are first-time events, such as seeing the North Sea for the first time. Accessibility, and the presence of amenities are also relevant for enhancing attachment. Moreover, the current research shows that place attachment is relevant for policymaking as 1) it unravels environmental quality by exposing resident’s opinions; 2) increased place attachment is linked to a better individual and communal quality of life as it promotes community involvement; 3) attached individuals are more likely to overcome local problems because they share the same interest in place; 4) place attachment is linked to pro-environmental and nature conservation behaviours as individuals are willing to protect the place."
Advanced In Vitro Models for Biomedical Research: Technological progress towards physiological relevance and high throughput,"['Moon, Harry']","['Levato, Riccardo']",2023-08-11T00:01:47Z,EN,['In vitro models; technology; high-throughput; physiological relevance'],Regenerative Medicine and Technology,"In vitro models are an indispensable tool for biomedical research due to their high levels of experimental control coupled with their reduction of animal testing which facilitates high levels of translatability of results to human patients. Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures fail to adequately reflect complex native environments due to a lack of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, coupled with the absence of waste and nutrient gradients. An ideal in vitro model is both physiologically relevant and facilitates high-throughput assessment. Numerous technological advances have progressed in vitro models in order to accommodate both of these characteristics, and these can be broadly categorized into (1) enhanced 3D culture techniques, (2) support systems and bioprinting, and (3) dynamic culture systems. The first technological category has allowed the recapitulation of 3D cell-cell interactions, as well as those between cells and their environment. The advent of support systems and bioprinting enables researchers to precisely integrate the ECM, a key native tissue component, into architecturally complex in vitro models. The final category encompasses the incorporation of dynamic microenvironments and biophysical stimuli in order to better resemble the dynamic nature of the human body. This review aims to highlight key publications which exemplify how these technological categories have enabled the next generation of in vitro models. The combination of these technologies may be the basis for achieving the “best of both” in terms of high throughput and high content models. Through this literature review, two techniques stand out due to their ability to encompass these aspects. Volumetric bioprinting and organ-on-a-chip technologies may therefore hold the keys for the future of advanced in vitro models."

Negative effects associated with exposure to idealized images are proposed to occur through social comparison processes and subsequently lead to the internalization of beauty ideals. One proposed solution to combat these negative effects is to add disclaimers on idealized images indicating the image has been digitally enhanced. However, a growing body of research suggest this solution will not be effective. The present study aimed to experimentally investigate the effect disclaimer labels have on the internalization of beauty ideals in women. Participants were 91 women between the ages of 18 to 33, who were randomly assigned to view idealized images without a disclaimer label (condition 1) or with a disclaimer label (condition 2). The internalization of beauty ideals after exposure to the idealized images was compared for women in both conditions, which revealed no effect of the presence of a disclaimer label on the internalization of beauty ideals was found. However, the perceived importance participants put on beauty ideals was found to predict the internalization of beauty ideals. Unexpectedly, age did not have a significant effect on the internalization of beauty ideals, regardless of condition. In sum, the present study showed no benefit to adding disclaimer labels to idealized images on social media, providing more support for the inefficacy of this proposed solution. Further research is required to identify factors that influence the internalization of beauty ideals to discover an effective solution for the negative effects associated with idealized images."
Imputing Missing values in Relational Event History data: A Framework for Social Network Research,"['Dvoriak, Vira']","['Shafiee Kamalabad, Mahdi']",2023-08-11T00:01:57Z,EN,"['Multiple Imputation, missing data, Relational Event History data, Relational Event Model']",Applied Data Science,"Background – Missing values are practically inevitable when it comes to data analysis and can cause loss of valuable information and introduce bias in the estimates. In social network data even a small proportion of missing values can have a substantial impact on the validity of results. The most common approach to deal with missing values is complete case analysis which does not always prevent these issues. Still, the research investigating this problem is scarce. This paper aims to address this gap by providing an overview of multiple imputation as a method of handling missing values in social network data. 
Methods – Relational event model analysis is performed on the fully observed relational event history dataset to produce the true estimates. Next, a simulation study is performed to introduce missingness to a fully observed dataset. Then the results of two approaches - multiple imputation and complete case analysis are compared to the results of the analysis on       the fully observed dataset. 
Results –Multiple imputation with relational event model produced estimates with close to zero bias, high coverage rate, and low average width. However, multiple imputation produced false significant p-values. In addition, the distributions of the effect estimates were slightly skewed for all effects. Complete case analysis produced overestimated effects and standard errors but did not produce false significant p-values. 
Conclusion – This study made first steps in evaluating whether multiple imputation with relational event model is a valid method to address missing values in relational event history data and compared it to the more common solution – complete case analysis. The findings reveal potential benefits of multiple imputation and propose direction for future research."

However, it is not sufficiently clear what the role of the type of use, active or passive, and whether sex differences can be found in this regard. Therefore, this study focusses on the relation between active social media use (ASMU) and passive social media use (PSMU) and sexual risk behavior among adolescents between 16-18 years old, and whether these relations where different for boys or girls. To conduct the study an online questionnaire was administered in Qualtrics, consisting of the ‘Sexual Risk Survey’, and the ‘ASMU and PSMU scale’. In total, there were 34 participants who completed the questionnaires, including 20 girls and 14 boys. The age range varied from 16 to 18 years (M = 17.24, SD = 0.82). The results showed that both ASMU and PSMU were positively related to sexual risk behavior among adolescents. No gender differences were found in the relation between ASMU and sexual risk behavior. However, the relation between PSMU and sexual risk behavior was stronger for girls than for boys. It is important for both practice and future research to distinguish between how adolescents use social media and to take into account gender differences"
"Between Liberty and Slavery. Debates on republicanism and abolitionism in the Dutch Patriot and Batavian Revolutions, 1760-1800.","['Timmermans, Rick']","['Vartija, Devin']",2023-08-17T00:01:33Z,EN,['slavery; liberty; republicanism; antislavery; abolitionism; Batavian Republic; Patriot Revolution; Batavian Revolution; Pieter Vreede;'],History,"Although Dutch Patriot and Batavian republicans argued for political liberty and against political slavery in their revolutions, their usage of political servitude in their writings has been deemed ‘rhetorical’ and ‘metaphorical’ in historiography, as republican ideas were thought to have never been applied to chattel slavery. In the years leading up to the revolutions, however, a growing body of antislavery discourse was taking hold in Dutch public discourse. Previous scholarship has primarily focused on explaining the absence of a Dutch Abolition Society, and has therefor missed an opportunity to investigate the symbiosis of the period’s dominant political language and discourse of abolitionism. 

This thesis therefore investigates how Dutch antislavery discourse combined with republican ideas and language in Dutch periodicals, intellectual treatises and speeches during the Patriot and Batavian periods (1760-1800). In 1760s and 1770s, a debate on the unvirtuous nature of wealth and luxury became prominent in both republican and antislavery discourse, even though the two strains of thought did not definitively combine in this period. Nonetheless, as international abolitionist publications were translated into Dutch in the 1790s, some authors – including prominent (future) Batavian revolutionary republicans – did seek to combine their antislavery ideas with the dominant political ideas of republicanism, not only through antiluxury, but also in highlighting the similarity between the master-slave and tyrant-subject relationship. Many revolutionaries published antislavery treatises, spoke out against the slave trade, or wrote poetry on the topic during both the Patriot and Batavian revolution. This overlap between the fight of some Batavians against political and chattel slavery reached its peak in two debates in the Batavian National Assembly in 1797 on (gradual) abolition. These debates, although officialy on the topic of slavery, should be interpreted as a discussion on the most fundamental political ideas of the Batavian Republic. Representatives were fully aware that, whilst they debated the issue of slavery,  their words touched upon the core principles of their most fundamental political ideology: republicanism. Despite the fierce resistance of representatives such as Pieter Vreede, the members of the National Assembly eventually chose to limit the scope of republican liberty, influenced by fears of societal collapse and pre-imperialist arguments. However, especially the idea that Africans still occupied a 'natural state' of man - an idea brought into the centre of republican thought by social contract theorists such as Rousseau - made a universal interpretation of republican liberty impossible. 

Despite their eventual defeat, this thesis shows that a number of Dutch republicans, although at times halted by internal derogatory ideas on the African Other, did connect their ideas on political slavery to the colonies in the late 1790s. The observations in this thesis are therefor particularly relevant for the history of the concepts 'liberty' and 'slavery' in (Dutch) republicanism - which extended beyond simple 'rhetorical' usage  - and are also interesting for further (international) comparative research or investigations into the relationship between republicanism and abolitionism in the nineteenth century."
Does exercise improve cognitive abilities?

However, only few studies consider the underlying cognitive mechanism that defines this relation. The aim of the present study is to a correlational design to determine the connections between inhibitory control, physical exercise and theta power using a correlational design. Furthermore, the secondary aim of the study is to compare theta power in successful and unsuccessful inhibitions.
Participants and methods: Using a counterbalanced and multi-method research design, 30 healthy adults (67% female, mean age = 25 years) completed an EEG measurement while conducting a stop- signal task (SST). Before the experiment, participants filled in the International Physical Assessment Questionnaire (IPAQ), measuring the self-reported weekly time of vigorous and moderate physical activity. A correlational analysis was conducted to establish the relationships between average theta power in successful and in unsuccessful stops, physical exercise levels, and SSRT, both in visual and auditory conditions. A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to determine the difference in theta power in successful and failed inhibitions.
Results: No significant correlations were found theta power and SSRT (r = -0.242, p = 0.189), vigorous and moderate exercise and SSRT (r = -0.131, p = 0.484), or theta power and vigorous and moderate exercise (r = 0.227, p = 0.220). The findings from the repeated measures ANOVA suggested that theta power values differed significantly across successful and failed inhibitions, indicating that stop outcome significantly affected the amount of theta power in the brain (F(1, 30) = 6.400, p = 0.017).
Conclusion: The findings suggest that theta power is a significant predictor for inhibitory control. Therefore, the results provide a valuable window into the intricate interplay between neural oscillations, physical exercise, and cognitive control. As no significant correlations are found, future research is encouraged to further investigate the relationships."
"Bloody gender: the new (in)visibility of menstruations, or how feminist progress can negatively impact trans communities.","['Gousset, Ju']","['Hossain, Adnan']",2023-08-17T00:01:41Z,EN,['Menstruations ; menstrual feminism ; transgender studies ; France ; intersectionnality ; feminism ; period taboo'],Gender Studies (Research),"[""Nowadays, the feminist movement called “menstrual activism”, or “menstrual equity” become more and more a subject of predilection for feminist activists and gender studies researchers. Today’s menstrual activists consider menstruation as an issue of recognition and equity between gender, and it even reach trans studies as menstruations were for a long time seen as a symbol of womanhood. However, this movement has changed a lot between the second and third waves of feminism, creating a new paradigm of menstruation. Indeed, even if menstrual activism always worked on the deconstruction of periods taboo, and the inequalities menstruators suffer because of this biological particularity, the third-wave feminism appropriation of this movement is also the beginning of the visibility of menstruation: today’s menstrual activists consider menstruations as an issue of recognition and equity, a difference between humans that should not be invisibilized neither be the symbol of weakness, while menstruations were for “second-wave feminists” more an issue of control and easing.
Yet, this new visibility of menstruation as a “women's right” and “celebration of womanhood” can have a negative impact on other communities, and in particular the trans community. To interrogate the inclusivity of trans identities in intersectional feminism, I will use the case study of the new visibility of menstruation to ask: do the actions of feminists in fighting the stigmas of menstruation (negatively or positively) impact trans people? While studying the example of the increasing visibility of menstruation since 2015 in France, I would like to show that today’s “menstrual activism” and menstrual politics lack intersectionality. By being trans-exclusionary, these activists and politics invisibilize trans folks, forgetting that not all women have periods, and not all menstruators are women. Thus, this research tries to show how recent feminist actions still face a lot of issues, such as essentialism and transphobia.
This analysis permits us to also show how intersectionality is still needed in feminism and that feminist progress does not automatically call for gender equality.

INVESTIGATING SEX DIFFERENCES IN ADVERSE EVENTS OF CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICATIONS,"['Holtari, Riikka']","['Bots, Sophie']",2023-08-17T00:01:36Z,EN,[],Epidemiology,"In this literature review, we researched differences in side effects experienced by men and women in response to cardiovascular drugs. First, we conducted a rigorous search for scientific articles, prioritising the most recent ones to ensure the findings were up-to-date. We examined studies investigating sex-based differences in how heart medications impacted patients, particularly concerning Adverse Events (AEs). To achieve this, they explored various proxies, such as effectiveness, actual AEs, and treatment changes, since comprehensive side effect data was often lacking.
The main finding of our study was that women tend to experience side effects more frequently than men. However, it is challenging for researchers to establish this link definitively due to variations in data quality. Nonetheless, the valuable insights from this research will contribute significantly to future investigations focusing on sex differences in medication side effects.
Effectiveness, including factors like mortality and hospitalisation, emerged as valuable proxies to study AEs when comprehensive side effect data is unavailable. This approach allowed researchers to gain valuable information on side effect incidence, even with limited data quality. Additionally, some studies explored predictors for AEs, focusing on medication effectiveness (e.g., reaching target blood pressure measurements). These studies emphasised the importance of considering sex differences when identifying medication side effects, as we found evident sex disparities in AEs related to cardiovascular drugs. The review also investigated spontaneous reporting, different drug classes, physiological predictors, and others, and this method provided essential insights into the incidence of side effects, especially for women and men who may experience different AEs from cardiovascular medications.
In conclusion, this literature review has provided valuable insights into medication side effects related to cardiovascular health. We explored strategies and proxies to uncover crucial information on how AEs may differ between men and women. While data quality remains a challenge, this study's findings contribute significantly to future research efforts to understand and develop personalised treatment plans for both men and women. By acknowledging and addressing sex-based differences in medication side effects, we can take significant steps toward enhancing patient care and safety, ultimately improving health outcomes for all."

Three subgroups were defined that differentiated in the amount of reported symptoms: moderate, high, and extremely high amount of symptoms. In the Dutch sample, similar subgroups were found. Greater exposure to traumatic events was related to membership of classes with more symptoms. Sexual assault was related to membership of classes with more symptoms in the Dutch sample but not in the refugee sample. Other unwanted sexual experiences did not predict class membership. This is the first study conducting an LCA among refugees across the full range of psychopathological symptoms and shows that subgroups can be defined in quantitative, and not in qualitative terms."
Red Tape and Employee Outcomes: Boredom at Work as a Mediator,"['Luo, Maliya']","['Taris, Toon']",2023-08-17T00:01:46Z,EN,[],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Red tape in the workplace is generally accepted to be harmful to both employees and organizations, but the underlying mechanism is still understudied. This study proposed work-related boredom as a potential mediator of the relationships between red tape and its outcomes, i.e., turnover intention, burnout, and in-role and extra-role work performance. To better understand the operations of the relationships, we divided red tape into two dimensions, functionality and burden. As predicted, the results showed that both dimensions of red tape and boredom were closely related and had detrimental effects on employee outcomes. Work-related boredom acted as a partial mediator within these relationships, except when the in-role performance was the outcome, boredom fully mediated the effect of red tape – functionality on in-role work performance, whereas there is no mediation of boredom existing within the relationships between red tape – burden and in-role performance. Our study suggested that all types of red tape can negatively impact employees. Furthermore, future research could focus on boredom as a general mediator of red tape and its effects."

To acquire more insights on the useability of a tactile map, this study looked at the differences in the acquisition age of braille on the understanding and useability of a tactile map. The participants were split into two groups, one with participants who learned braille at a young age (3-8 years old), and one with participants who learned braille at a later age (14+ years old). The participants performed search tasks on two tactile maps, during which their search times were measured, as well as their error rates. Group 1 (early learners), who learned braille at an early age (average acquisition age of 5 years old), showed a faster response time (311 ms per question) than group 2 (late learners), who learned braille at a later age (average acquisition age of 29 years old) (909 ms per question). The early learners also showed a lower error rate (38,89%) than the late learners (48.61%). Even though the differences in response times and error rates were not significant, we still learned a lot about the tactile maps that were used. Based on the feedback from the participants, and the observations that were made by the experiment leader during the experiment, some points of improvement for the maps were found. These should be tackled since it would be ideal to provide the user with a tactile map that is easy to use and understand."

flink gedaald. In het kader van deze ‘leescrisis’ roepen literatuurwetenschappers op tot
hervorming van het literatuuronderwijs. Yra van Dijk en Els Stronks stellen ‘onderzoekend
lezen’ voor als nieuwe leesmethode. Deze manier van lezen heeft een inhoudelijke focus,
plaatst leerlingen in de rol van betekenisgever en lijkt hun leesmotivatie te bevorderen. Het
wetenschappelijke paradigma ‘ecokritiek’ heeft raakvlakken met ‘onderzoekend lezen’ en
kan literatuur koppelen aan een thema dat voor veel leerlingen herkenbaar is: de
klimaatcrisis. Daarom is de potentie van ecokritisch lezen als vorm van onderzoekend lezen
voor het literatuuronderwijs onderzocht middels de onderzoeksvraag: In hoeverre kan
ecokritisch lezen als vorm van onderzoekend lezen worden toegepast op canonieke literatuur
in het literatuuronderwijs op de middelbare school? Er is voor canonieke literatuur gekozen,
omdat die vaak niet overeenkomt met de belevingswereld van de huidige generatie
scholieren. Middels een verkennend onderzoek dat bestaat uit een casestudy van F.
Bordewijks Knorrende beesten (1933) en daaruit voortkomende aanbevelingen voor
ecokritisch lesmateriaal, poogt deze scriptie instrumenten en concepten te bieden die
canonieke werken toegankelijker kunnen maken voor leerlingen. Knorrende beesten is aan de
hand van drie ecokritische lezingen onderzocht: de representatie van de
weersomstandigheden, een petokritische lezing en een ecokritische allegorese met een focus
op pastorale motieven. Iedere deelconclusie is in meer of mindere mate inherent tegenstrijdig
en gaat dieper in op de werking van schaal in de context van het Antropoceen. De
aanbevelingen voor het lesmateriaal zijn vooral gebaseerd op de casestudy, op raakvlakken
tussen ‘onderzoekend lezen’ en ‘ecokritiek’ en op de ASOOO benadering van onderwijs. Het
toepassen van ecokritisch lezen als vorm van onderzoekend lezen op canonieke literatuur
genereert – in ieder geval bij Knorrende beesten en mogelijk ook bij andere canonieke
werken – verschillende, tegenstrijdige interpretaties. De werking van schaal kan daar een
extra dimensie aan toevoegen en zelfs tot nieuwe betekenissen leiden. Welke specifieke
concepten en instrumenten canonieke literatuur toegankelijker kunnen maken voor leerlingen
van alle niveaus in het voortgezet onderwijs, moet nog onderzocht worden.
Vervolgonderzoek zou zich verder nog kunnen richten op de potentie van andere vormen van
ideologisch-kritisch lezen als vorm van onderzoekend lezen in het literatuuronderwijs."
Why do we help? Does joint attention facilitate prosocial behaviour in young children and what role do siblings play?,"['Beemt, Michelle van den']","['Wolf, Wouter']",2023-08-24T00:01:20Z,EN,['Joint attention; Prosocial behaviour; Siblings; Young children'],Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"Prosocial behaviour is an important aspect of human interaction, crucial for creating and maintaining peer relationships in children. However, we know relatively little about how the selectivity of prosocial behaviour develops in young children’s social relationships. Research shows that social bonding activities promote prosocial behaviour. This suggests a cognitive mechanism facilitating social bonding. Therefore, we suggest joint attention as a possible explaining mechanism for prosocial behaviour. Furthermore, as joint attention might work differently for children with siblings, we suggest an interaction effect of joint attention and siblings on prosocial behaviour. To research this, we did a behaviour experiment with children between three and five years old with a joint attention condition in which the participant watched a video with an experimenter and a disjoint attention condition in which the participant watched a video while the experimenter read a book. We then looked at whether watching a video with someone else influenced helping behaviour and whether children with siblings showed more helping behaviour. Although we could not draw definitive conclusions about the effect of joint attention on prosocial behaviour and about the interaction effect of siblings and joint attention on prosocial behaviour, it has become clear that we need to continue researching this. By doing so, we gain a better understanding of the mechanism facilitating prosocial behaviour and the role that siblings play. This might help us to stimulate prosocial behaviour in children struggling with this."
The Business Activity Model as a Pragmatic Strategic tool for Digital Transformation cases,"['Paulus, Sander']","['Brand, Nico']",2023-08-24T00:01:22Z,EN,"['Digital transformation, Business Activity Model, Digital transformation case classification framework']",Business Informatics,"Rapidly evolving industries require organisations to embark on a digital transformation. These
transformations have a large impact on the entire organisation, as technologies, business models
and organisational structures can be impacted. The new technologies, fierce competition and high
user expectations push organisation to change, but due to the size and complexity of these
transformations, many projects fail. This concept also triggered a scientific response to structure and
define this concept to improve the success rate and understanding. The scientific base is lacking in
empirically driven literature and practical tools to support practitioners on their digital
transformation. In a response to this need, the Business Activity Model (BAM) was created to assist
in the strategic process to determine what aspects of the organisation need to change to stay
competitive. This model has shown great potential to assist in the practical application in digital
transformations but is lacking in consistency in how it is applied. Confusion regarding the methods
causes discussion by the users and misunderstanding of why it is applied.
To discover how the BAM should be applied, a relationship between the cases in which they are
applied and how it is applied is researched. To discover this relation, first a framework (DTCCF) is
created that includes relevant aspects of the digital transformation in relation to the classification of
practical digital transformation cases. Secondly, multiple characteristics of the BAM are identified to
help discover different methods that are used to apply the BAM. Finally, the relation between the
identified case types and BAM methods is analysed to discover how the BAM should be applied.
Multiple case types are identified using the created framework, but the variance in how the BAM
was applied was not caused by the case types. In the same case types the BAM was applied in
different ways, which was caused by content and process related decisions. What content is needed
and the effect that the process can have, needs to be balanced to apply the BAM in the best way."
The impact of a comprehensive ecolabel to guide consumers toward more sustainable choices: the effect of the Climate Score and price on consumers’ willingness to buy,"['Matser, Eveliene']","['Driessen, Josi']",2023-08-24T00:01:11Z,EN,['ecolabel; willingness to buy; sustainable consumption; environmental self-identity'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Behaviour change is needed to combat climate change. A major contribution to this would be to adopt a more sustainable diet. However, limited knowledge on the sustainability of products pose a challenge for consumers. Nutritional labels that are displayed on front of packages, like the Nutri-Score, are promising in promoting healthy food choices. In this online choice experiment, we investigated the effect of a newly designed ecolabel, the climate score, and price, on consumers’ willingness to buy coffee and tea products. Environmental self-identity (ESI), the extent to which ones sees oneself as someone who acts environmentally-friendly, was used as a covariate in this study. A 3x4 within-subject analysis revealed that participants were more willing to buy products with higher climate scores compared to products with medium, low or no climate scores. Next to that, it was found that consumers are more willing to buy products with a high price when those products also have a high climate score. Lastly, it was found that ESI predicted the willingness to buy products with a high, medium and low climate score, but not products without a climate score. These findings support the effectiveness of a climate score as a tool to promote sustainable choices, if implemented on all products. The implementation of one overarching ecolabel by the government would enable consumers to make more sustainable choices, thereby fostering a more positive global impact. Further research should focus on creating a real-life design to determine the actual impact of the climate score on consumer purchasing behaviour."

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of a plant-based default nudge in an out-of-home restaurant setting on food choice. Furthermore, meat attachment was assessed and evaluated as a moderator of the abovementioned effect. Meat-eaters living in the Netherlands were presented with a restaurant menu with either the plant-based default nudge condition or the meat default nudge condition. In total, 134 respondents answered questions concerning their food choice and meat attachment. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the plant-based default nudge had a significant effect on food choice. Respondents that were presented with the plant-based default nudge were approximately 4.5 times more likely (countering 61% against 13/%) to opt for the plant-based main course, compared to respondents in the meat default condition. The moderation effect of meat attachment was insignificant. In order to promote the protein transition, market actors and relevant organizations should consider default nudges as a relevant intervention toward promoting plant-based eating and plant-forward lifestyles. The default nudge on an out-of-home restaurant menu is easy to implement, low-cost and maintains freedom of choice for the consumer. Limitations are mentioned along with directions for future research about default nudges."
Managing expectations throughout Agile software engineering,"['Wijk, Jari van']","['Dalpiaz, Fabiano']",2023-08-24T00:01:24Z,EN,['Expectation management; Goal-Orientation; Social Trust; Agile Software Engineering; SCRUM'],Business Informatics,"Organizations have goals. To reach those goals, they perform business activities and tasks. One such activity could be the development of a new software system to support their other business activities. However, often organizations do not have the expertise or capacity to build such a system on their own, therefore they need the help of another organization to do so. Thus, they outsource such IT projects to another party, which creates a contractor-contractee relationship. This creates a dynamic of trust in which the contractor communicates its goals, tasks, and associated expectations to the contracted party, who in turn commits itself to carrying them out as effectively as possible. However, this dynamic can lead to issues such as unrealistic expectations, inaccurate estimations, and performing tasks that do not add value to the contractor’s goals. Through design science, this research aims to tackle those problems by designing a method that helps manage stakeholder expectations, so that software development of outsourced IT projects becomes more efficient and produces higher-quality software. First, through a structured literature study, the research explores the concepts of Agile software development; Expectation management; and Goal-orientation. Then it conducts a multiple-case study on two SCRUM teams to uncover the as-is methodology they employ. During this, it identifies areas of opportunities where goal-oriented practices could be applied to positively enhance their software development process. Through method engineering, method fragments are identified and assembled into an as-is & a
to-be method, which are validated by a set of experts in the field. No implementation and evaluation of the method to-be could take place, which makes it an opportunity for future research."

This thesis examines the relationship between a rise in the amount of theater collectives in the Dutch theater landscape and neoliberalism, with the focus on two pillars of neoliberalism: precarity and individualism. This study analyses how the current generation of Dutch theater collectives performs their collectivity as a response to neoliberalism in their work.
Using the relational approach of dramaturgical analysis as presented by Sigrid Merx and Liesbeth Groot Nibbelink as a method, this thesis incorporates a dramaturgical analysis of the composition and context of two performances created by contemporary theater collectives: Under pressure by BOG. and Nineties Productions, and Vincent Rietveld gaat voor de Louis d’Or by De Warme Winkel.
 	The neoliberal context that these collectives operate in, is shown to be present in every layer of their practice: in their choice to collaborate collectively, in the way these collectives think about creating and producing theater, in the composition of their work and in the way they address the audience. 
In both case studies, collectivity can be read as a way to revolt against this system, as well as a strategy to adapt to the system. Using self-reflectivity as a dramaturgical strategy allows this generation of collectives to critically reflect upon a system that both they and the spectator are a part of.""""]"

been gaining increasing popularity because of its apparent preservation-functioning of mangrove 
forests while also offering farmers the opportunity to gain an income from doing aquaculture. The 
Vietnamese government has regularly managed the ecosystem by using a co-management model in 
the form of land allocation. Farmers receive the right to do production on their piece of land but 
must adhere to forest-protection rules. This thesis aims to investigate what effect the comanagement model has in the integrated mangrove-aquaculture sector on farmers, other 
stakeholders, and the natural environment of Ca Mau, the Southern province of the Mekong Delta,
and how can it be explained using the criteria efficiency, equity, and sustainability. The use of these 
three criteria gives a more complete picture of the effects of the co-management model than only 
investigating the model from one lens. The commune of Vien An Dong (Viên An Đông), located in Ca 
Mau, is used as a case study research location to discover more in-depth and comprehensive 
knowledge about the subject. 20 interviews have been executed with farmers from the commune. 
Moreover, interviews with two experts have been performed as well as a focus group discussion with 
three representative farmers. 
With the gathered data, the co-management model in this commune proves to have shortterm positive effects on stakeholders and nature in integrated mangrove-aquaculture farming. It 
successfully preserves the mangrove forests and allows farmers to earn an income. However, in the 
long run, certain challenges may become difficult to resolve if changes do not occur. These 
challenges include farmers’ increasing resistance to the forest ratio rule, the increased encroachment 
of pollution within the commune, the inequitable distribution of benefits, and unbalanced relations 
of power. Moreover, there is a disparity in opinions between the farmers and other stakeholders 
with higher authorities regarding the impact of the co-management model on the commune. The 
positive attitudes of governmental organs and independent companies and the negative viewpoints 
of farmers towards the co-management model need to become more balanced for the model to 
succeed in the future."

Uncovering implicit question goals by extracting patterns from GIS sub-workflows,"['Marçal Russo, Letícia']","['Scheider, Simon']",2023-09-06T09:41:11Z,EN,['GIS; QA system; GeoQA system; QuAnGIS; sub-workflow'],Applied Data Science,"The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has expanded across various areas and has become even more important with the growth of big data in recent decades. However, its accessibility can be limited, because geo-analytical tools are spread out across multiple software programs and also scattered within a single software environment. To address this issue, one possible solution is to develop a geo-analytical Question-Answering (QA) system. Unlike traditional QA systems that work with simple query task, a geoGIS QA system requires a more complex transformation task. In order to achieve this, the answers provided by a GeoQA system should be in a workflow format, while the user’s questions are expressed in natural language. In this context, our research focuses on bridging the gap between workflows and natural language by introducing the concept of subquestions, which describe an underlying task, along with their corresponding sub-workflows. For this study, we generated data in the form of (sub-)questions, (sub-)workflows, and parse trees. These generated data were then subjected to analysis using two methods. The first method involves measuring the similarity between sub-questions and between parse trees to understand the extent to which GIS tools impact changes in sentences. The second method is based on word subtraction, which aims to identify specific question fragments associated with GIS tools. The methodology has demonstrated its ability to find patterns in natural language sentences and connect them to GIS tools, which are part of workflow structures. These patterns can potentially contribute to the development of a geoQA system, taking us a step closer towards its realization."

Recognising the government’s inadequacies, Abahlali baseMjondolo (Abahlali or AbM), the movement of/for/by the poor, claim what is rightfully theirs: land, housing and being treated with human dignity. This thesis studies AbM and their philosophy and politics, Ubuhlalism, to investigate Abahlali’s world-making practices. Taking Ubuhlalism as a point of departure for a situated feminist research praxis, I aim to research AbM on their own terms. Through aligning to Abahlali’s own narratives, those found in AbM’s counter-archive and from my in-person hangouts with the movement, this thesis seeks to trouble theoretical frameworks such as Achille Mbembe’s (2003, 2019) necropolitics, that relegate AbM to the status of living dead. My critique argues that theorisations that reduce oppressed groups to their oppression obscure marginalised groups’ lived realities and resistance strategies, thereby withholding their futurity. To listen closely to Abahlali’s investments in futurity I investigate Abahlali’s rehearsals for the future, highlighting how AbM insists on a futurity that is alternative to the futures propagated by the state/elite. I put Abahlali’s world-making practices in dialogue with Stefano Harney and Fred Moten’s (2013) Undercommons to draw attention to AbM’s practices of refusal, study and planning as strategies that resist systems of oppression such as the criminalisation/racialisation of poverty. In this thesis, I ask what are the world-making practices of Abahlali? How do their lived politics insist on an alternative sense of futurity that resists their relegation to the status of living dead? And, what can be learned from Ubuhlalism as practiced by AbM in shaping a situated feminist research praxis?"

Managing the unmanageable: Examining how cities can address the challenges that arise in their strategy-making process for decarbonizing their heating and cooling infrastructure,"['Groot, Boris de']","['Monstadt, Jochen']",2023-09-06T09:41:06Z,EN,['Strategic Spatial Planning; Decarbonising heating and cooling infrastructure; Urban Governance; Projectification; Socio-technical transitions'],Spatial Planning,"The mitigation of the effects of climate change is an increasingly urgent matter. To that effect, many cities aim to decarbonise their heating and cooling infrastructure, as the heating and cooling of the built environment requires a significant amount of the city’s energy demand. As this is a long-term development, cities usually use strategic frameworks to guide the transition process of decarbonising these infrastructures. However, this transition faces many significant challenges in both the social and the technical domains. These challenges severely limit cities in their capabilities to implement strategic frameworks and, therefore, the ability to enable and guide the transition in urban areas. This research aims to chart these challenges and explore how cities can address them to move forward with the transition.

To explore these challenges and assess their impact on the transition, this research examines the transitory development of decarbonising heating and cooling infrastructures through a multi-case study on Bilbao and Bratislava. The socio-technical transition of the decarbonisation of heating and cooling infrastructures in both cases is analysed using the four-track approach proposed by Strategic Spatial Planning theory and literary criteria for strategic frameworks. Furthermore, the extent to which the projectification phenomenon impacts the transition is assessed. The research concludes by identifying the uncertainty resulting from socio-technical heterogeneity as the major challenge to the transition, resulting in unclarity in long-term visions and in short-term and long-term actions. A further consequence of this uncertainty is identified as the paradoxical dependency of authorities on regime actors to facilitate the socio-technical regime change necessary to enable the transition. The projectification phenomenon is identified as a challenge to the transition and a possible pragmatic solution to the implications of the uncertainty-related challenges. The wicked nature of the problem is addressed. Finally, this research provides recommendations for further research and policy recommendations for municipalities to act on the identified challenges and learn from practical examples."

However, conflicts frequently occur within these partnerships, making it challenging to create shared value. This paper explores the strategies and practices used by companies and NGOs to resolve conflicts  that occur in CSPs. This is supported by the following research question: “How do NGOs and companies address conflicts that arise in CSPs, in order to create shared value?”. A multiple case study approach with in-depth interviews with companies and 
NGOs was carried out to develop propositions on the strategies employed in conflict resolution. According to preliminary findings, proactive strategies including the adoption of protocols, NGOs adopting a business model, and companies making social impact a core area are necessary for successful conflict resolution in CSPs. The 
implications of this research extend to the academic and practical domains. This research contributes to the current literature on successfully managing partnerships, by enlightening the mechanisms of conflict resolutions. It also adds valuable insights for practitioners, guiding the implementation of new strategies to efficiently address 
conflicts and maximise the social and economic gains brought about by the partnerships."
"Solar Degradation of Methyl Orange over La(Mn,Co)O3 Nano-perovskites and Thin Films","['Folkertsma, Lieven']","['Groot, Frank de']",2023-09-06T10:09:26Z,EN,[],Nanomaterials Science,"The substantial release of azo dyes presents an environmental and public health challenge due to their mutagenic, light-absorbing properties and their long life time. Photocatalytic degradation of these dyes could support regular wastewater treatment in purifying the process effluents of the textile industry.
In this work, LaCoO3, LaMnO3 and La2CoMnO6 nanoparticles were synthesized using a citrate sol-gel method, and characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and bright-field transmission electron microscopy. Using methyl orange as a model compound, and following the photobleaching process using in-situ UV-Vis spectroscopy, the as-synthesized LaCoO3 and La2CoMnO6 nanoparticles were demonstrated to be capable of photocatalytic degradation under visible light, although not unassisted: the degradation proceeded only at a pH of 3, or with the addition of the electron acceptor K2S2O8. Moreover, the La2CoMnO6 nanoparticles showed greater catalytic activity than LaCoO3.
Additionally, LaCoO3 and La2CoMnO6 thin films were deposited on Nb–SrTiO3 by means of pulsed laser deposition and studied by in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction, high-resolution X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. While these films were intended as model surfaces for mechanistic analysis of the nanoparticle catalysts, their tensile strain, as a result of lattice mismatch to the substrate, resulted in electronic states diverging from bulk."
Cross-border stock-financed mergers and (over)valuation: an event study on acquisition performance,"['Moonen, Félipe']","['Kaakeh, Abdulkader']",2023-09-06T10:09:33Z,EN,"['“overvaluation”, “stock-financed”, “acquisition-performance”, “event-study”']",Banking and Finance,"Given the tech industry's prominence in M&A activities and its pursuit of knowledge and market expansion (Ma and Liu, 2017), the research aims to examine acquisition performance by investigating the (inter)relation between overvaluation, acquiring motives, financing-method and its consequences for shareholder value creation. The findings cast substantial doubt on the ability of firms to effectively leverage synergies through acquired technology and knowledge. Empirical evidence from this study reveals that acquisitions, regardless of the financing method employed, tend to turn out value destructive. While overvaluation among acquirers can lead to motive misguidance and negatively affect M&A performance (Shleifer and Vishny, 2003), the results of this research highlight that target overvaluation plays a more significant role in driving value destruction. This finding holds true across different deal types and time horizons."
Assessing the impact of Foreign Direct Investment on Societal Development in Sub-Saharan African countries,"['Meindl, Stephan']","['Dirksen, Erik']",2023-09-06T10:09:28Z,EN,['Development Economics; Foreign Direct Investment (FDI); Human Development Index (HDI); Panel Data Analysis'],International Management,"This research investigates the impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on societal development in a select group of Sub-Saharan African countries. Historically, FDI has played in important role in economic growth for developing countries and competitive advantages for companies. Recent trends have shown returns on FDI become diminishing once certain economic thresholds are met, leading to a shift in FDI targets. Therefore, this research aims to understand how FDI in Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe affects societal development, measured by the Human Development Index (HDI), between 1996 and 2021.
Current literature indicates the importance of institutional quality on economic growth in the specified countries, and how this affects FDI inflows. Despite the varying, yet high yields from FDI, current research is inconclusive about the effects of FDI on HDI and what drives the two. Especially in the absence of high-quality institutions the effects are difficult to observe.
To address the arising research gaps, this study employs panel data linear regression analysis to examine the relationship between FDI and HDI. The results indicate that there is a strong positive relationship between FDI and HDI, while increasing quality of institutions hinder the societal development from FDI. Additionally, the Cobalt mining activities in the DRC are found to have no significant effect as an economic driver on FDI.
The findings provide information to policymakers and investors about effective FDI in Sub-Saharan Africa in the absence of strong institutions and how such investments can improve the quality of life for local society."
"Berger’s Holonomy Theorem, and a First Incursion into Lie Algebroid Holonomy","['Pedregal Pastor, Jaime']","['Cavalcanti, G.R.']",2023-09-06T10:09:05Z,EN,"[""Holonomy; Berger's list; Lie algebroid""]",Mathematical Sciences,"The holonomy group of a connection is very intimately related to the curvature of the connection and to the existence and quantity of parallel sections, thus controlling an important part of the geometry. The Lie groups that can arise as the holonomy group of the Levi-Civita connection of a Riemannian manifold were classified by Berger, resulting in a list of seven possible groups. These holonomies give rise to special geometries, like Kähler, Calabi–Yau or hyperkähler geometries. It was not until fifty years later that Olmos offered a geometric proof of Berger’s theorem, as an alternative to Berger’s more algebraic proof. The first part of this work is dedicated to presenting Olmos’s proof, orderly developing the requisites needed to understand it.
In the second part we introduce the generalization of holonomy to the Lie algebroid setting. Lie algebroids are, in a sense, a generalization of the tangent bundle and, as such, it makes sense to consider Lie algebroid connections and Lie algebroid holonomy. This new concept presents some remarkable new features. The first one is the failure of the Ambrose–Singer theorem: the holonomy algebra is not only determined by curvature, but also by the isotropy of the algebroid. We give a new proof of this Lie algebroid Ambrose–Singer theorem, and provide some original examples of flat Lie algebroid connections with non-discrete holonomy. Secondly, the notion of Lie algebroid holonomy is a leafwise notion, so the holonomy can jump from leaf to leaf. When considering general Lie algebroid connections on vector bundles, this behavior can be quite wild: it can jump either up or down when changing to smaller leaves. We provide as well original examples of such behaviors."

Bridging knowledge between marine conservation actors in Pacific Small Island Developing States: A new perspective on the work of boundary organisations,"['Latour, Moritz']","['Laerhoven, Frank van']",2023-09-12T00:00:58Z,EN,['boundary organisations; knowledge uptake; knowledge exchange; marine conservation; local communities'],Sustainable Development,"In the face of growing pressures on the marine environment, the significance of evidence-based decision-making in the realm of marine conservation policies is of utmost importance. In this context, the current literature predominantly concentrates on understanding and addressing barriers to knowledge exchange between scientists and policymakers, as well as exploring diverse science-policy interface models. Among these approaches, boundary organisations stand out as highly promising in bridging the gap between science and policymaking. Through their boundary work, comprising the transfer of knowledge through the production of boundary objects and the facilitation of knowledge exchange, boundary organisations aim at achieving an uptake of knowledge by policymakers, thus contributing to evidence-based decision-making. Fundamental in this process of boundary work is that the knowledge conveyed is perceived as salient, credible, and legitimate by the actors addressed, as this is seen as a prerequisite for knowledge uptake into the policy sphere.

Based on this theoretical background, several success factors for the work of boundary organisations were identified in the literature. However, so far, the research on knowledge exchange between marine scientists and policymakers as well as on boundary organisations in general is largely based on case studies in the Global North, highlighting the need to conduct studies on knowledge uptake in different geographical and political settings, with an increased focus on the Global South. By confronting the current conceptual view on boundary organisations with the specific empirical reality of marine conservation in Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS), this thesis seeks to improve knowledge uptake in SIDS by identifying factors and strategies for successful boundary work in this context and to enrich the generic understanding of the role of boundary organisations with perspectives from the Global South.

The results of this study contribute to the current literature on boundary organisations in several respects. Based on the insights from a series of interviews with boundary organisations working on marine conservation in Pacific SIDS, the success factors identified in the literature could be supplemented and concretised, resulting in the development of a new framework for successful boundary work that is better adapted to realities in the Global South. In particular, the findings shed light on the so far largely unrecognised sphere of local communities in the work of boundary organisations. The observed importance of local communities for marine conservation in Pacific SIDS necessitates a reconceptualisation of the understanding of boundary work towards science-policy-community interfaces, emphasising that the gap between marine science and policy can only be bridged by engaging local communities and their knowledge due to their essential role for the production and dissemination of salient, credible, and legitimate knowledge."
Circular Start-Ups in the Textile Industry: Adoption of Circular Practices and Context Barriers,"['Bicego, Laura']","['Rosales Carreon, Jesus']",2023-09-12T00:00:54Z,EN,['circularity; start-ups; textile industry; regulations; local context'],Sustainable Development,"This research examines the circular practices adopted by circular Start-Ups (SUs) in the textile industry based on their local legislative context. The textile industry is one of the most ecologically damaging industries in the world due to its wide supply chain that entails many energy-intensive and polluting processes. This is specifically true for established companies that have been carrying out a linear model in their production system. Signs of improvement have been noticed on a smaller scale, for instance in SUs that have introduced circular practices in their core system from the outset of their businesses. However, few studies have been conducted on integrating the performance of circular SUs in the textile industry based on their local legislative context. Legislative context has a significant role in shaping decisions as proper legislation and policies are essential factors for moving towards circularity, but it is often perceived as a barrier for entrepreneurs to move forwards.
To carry out this research, this study investigates the practices and regulatory context of six companies, located in two different countries. The investigation process was based on a framework specifically created for this research aiming at pointing out the circular strategies, practices and barriers of each company. Therefore, the analysis entailed desk research to understand the current local regulatory context; interviews to gain insights into companies’ activities and the perceived barriers from their regulatory context; MFAs to have an overview of the production process of the selected companies and identify waste sources; each company was framed into a Business Model (BM) described in Coscieme et al., (2022) to integrate previous findings on opponent factors dependent on a specific BM.
Results show that practices leading to waste reduction, textile reuse and resale, and garments lifespan extension are the most common, although they present some limitations still. Results also demonstrate that the obstacles emerging from their coercive context are mostly due to poor involvement in easing the path towards circularity and to a lack of sufficient investments, but differently stressed in the two countries.
Overall, circular SUs could improve their practices by introducing innovative technical and managerial features. More investments and a systematic vision applied to the textile industry at the regulatory level could help in easing the process."
"Getting Closer to ""The Bagel"": Audiovisual representations of Depression in the movie Everything Everywhere All at Once","['Yang, Zhiyuan']","['Ramstedt, Kim']",2023-09-12T00:00:49Z,EN,[],Applied Musicology,"Everything Everywhere All At Once stands as a multifaceted cinematic journey, seamlessly interweaving genres from black comedy to science fiction, martial arts films, and even animation. Central to this narrative is a family deeply affected by depression, navigating the challenges of generational trauma, intricate relationship dynamics, and layered identity struggles. A pivotal question this dissertation aims to address is: How does the film's experimental music, particularly by Son Lux, enhance, represent, and immerse the audience in the intricate emotions and depth of the portrayed depression? To address this, a close reading method was employed to explore the psychological evolution of the primary characters. Their transformative journeys—from deep-rooted depression, encounters with suicidal thoughts, to ultimate acceptance and integration—are meticulously unpacked. Concurrently, this research assesses each character's emotional trajectory, individually and in relation to one another. Building on this narrative exploration, the study also delves into existing theoretical discussions on the therapeutic capabilities of music, examining its significance in cinematic portrayals mirroring authentic emotional journeys and coping strategies. This twofold examination accentuates the harmonious interplay between story and sound in cinema, highlighting music's deep-seated role as a therapeutic medium. In combining these perspectives, the research furnishes a comprehensive view of the intersections among film, music, and mental well-being. It accentuates the critical role of detailed cinematic depictions in promoting mental health conversations."

USP system's energy output consistently surpassed the target of 1 million kWh annually, reaffirming its effectiveness in sustainable energy generation. KNN imputation was used to address data gaps, enhancing analysis accuracy. Assessment of performance metrics, encompassing energy output, final yield, reference yield, and performance ratio, illuminated system efficiency and variability. South-oriented, 30-degree tilt subsystems outperformed, while W-E-S orientation yielded the least. Total in-plane irradiation yield was modeled with Python pvlib and Soalrgis Prospect Model, with the former generated higher reference yields due to its clear sky modeling, while Solargis introduced more nuanced predictions based on historical weather patterns. Both pvlib and System Advisor Model (SAM) were used to simulate expected energy production, with pvlib’s results significantly higher than SAM; Energy Performance Index (EDI) is above 1 for the 2018 and 2019, with SAM’s results, and below 1 during 2020 and 2022 with pvlib’s results. These differences emphasize the importance of considering real-world conditions, including shading and atmospheric effects, to refine performance assessments. Regression analysis highlighted panel orientation and tilt angle's significant impact on final yield. Although limitations exist, future research should incorporate on-site measurements and advanced modeling techniques to account for local weather conditions' influence on system performance."

Recent studies show that the chances that all waters in the Netherlands will reach good status before 2027 are minimal. A gap existed in the literature on the degree of success of the approach used to implement the WFD’s River Basin Approach in the Netherlands. The aim of this research was to get an insight into the multilevel interactions and coordination mechanisms for the WFD at a basin level in the Netherlands. An assessment framework of success factors was created and through interviews in combination with a document analysis, the prevalence of these factors in the Dutch Rhine West sub-river basin was analysed. It was found that while knowledge capacity and financial means were present, other factors important for the WFD realisation were missing. Especially political commitment, coordination, and integration were found to be missing. Therefore, it was concluded that the River Basin Approach in Rhine West cannot be seen as an example of good Multilevel Water Governance, generalising these conclusions to the national level would require further research. To overcome the limited political commitment, integration, and coordination this research suggests raising more awareness for the topic through campaigns and lobbying, further emphasising side benefits of improved water quality, redistributing more resources to the sub-basin, and appointing a project owner for issues that need to be addressed."

Even though it merely constitutes a proposal for the moment, subordinate government bodies such as provinces, municipalities and regional water authorities need to explore what it entails for them and how they could implement it in their functioning. To contribute to the latter, this research addresses the academically underexposed temporal challenge to reconcile the short-term with the long-term in area-oriented processes. This research uses five newly identified temporal strategies in the field of time and governance as means to address this challenge and, in-doing so, puts these temporal strategies to a first reality check. Taking the perspective of water managers, the area-oriented processes Hollandse IJssel Oost, Blauwe Agenda and Toekomstbestendige Polder Lange Weide are first analyzed using the PAA framework. Hereafter, the use of the temporal strategies “Timing”, “Crafting time horizons”, “Pacing”, “Futuring” and “Cyclical adaptation” is evaluated. Based on this evaluation, this research identifies promising action perspectives to connect the short-term to long-term in area-oriented processes. Subsequently, this research highlights that, while some further conceptual development is necessary, the temporal strategies provide an useful critical lens that can help contribute to making the water and land system a steering concept."

the specific practices these fans undertake. Indeed, audience studies have come a long way from the 
demonisation of television to the blending of politics and entertainment, referred to as 'infotainment'. In 
its early stages, academics such as Neil Postman (2005a, 64; 2005b, 124) and Robert Putnam (1995, 8-
10) believed that television was polluting public discourse, decreasing democratic vitality, and reducing 
citizens' social capital. However, recent academics have a more optimistic outlook on fans and 
audiences.
Fan theorists, in particular Stuart Hall (1980, 117-127), John Fiske (2010a, 129; 2010b 64) and 
Henry Jenkins (2013a, 278; 2013b, 1-2), see audience members as active social subjects that engage
with practices in relation to media text, with a mixture of emotional responses and critical observation. 
Furthermore, Jenkins (2008b, 10-22) argues that since the advent of the internet and social media, 
producers (and other tv executives) invite audiences more fully into participatory culture more fully 
because they are encouraged to engage with media texts outside of watching the tv show. 
Additionally, since the rise in popularity of infotainment shows (e.g., The Colbert Report or Have I Got 
News for You), there has been a reconsideration of traditional and non-traditional democratic and 
political engagement streams.
Indeed, new media has become an important factor in political engagement. Joseph Kahne et 
al. (2014, 3-20) contend that social media sites have become lucrative arenas of political information 
and deliberation. While political engagement and debate have always existed, it is only since the turn 
of the 2000s that studies have been conducted on these acts and specifically concerning political satire 
tv shows. Liesbet van Zoonen (2007, 531-547) combined active audience engagement and performing 
one’s political self in relation to fictional political satire tv shows to define four categories (description, 
judgement, reflection, and fantasy) on which this thesis takes its roots.
This research uses discourse analysis to demonstrate how political performances articulate 
concerning a specific case study. The thesis answered the following research question: How can the 
audience discourse of Have I Got News for You's Facebook comments be understood as a 
performance of a 'political self'?
The results underpin the importance of understanding this form of political participation and 
how these political performances go beyond fictional tv to enter non-fictional satire tv show arenas, 
such as Have I Got New for You’s official Facebook page. Moreover, this research demonstrates that 
blending satire, comedy, and political information can aid civic engagement and political life. 
Additionally, this thesis found that the Have I Got News for You audience enters specific fan practices 
(e.g., dialogue and creative fan-made memes) to bolster their political engagement.
Finally, this research reinforces the idea that online fan practices in relation to tv shows can be 
considered political participation. It observed that political performances are not limited to four specific 
categories. However, specific tv shows (e.g., Have I Got News for You) and specific political 
matters/issues (e.g., the partygate scandal) can group like-minded politically involved citizens. Thus, 
even more, qualitative analytical research is needed in this area. It is conceivable that future researchers 
could undertake follow-up research with the same participants to understand whether this participation 
spreads effectively across different media texts.,""""]"

Operation Inherent Resolve is a prime example of a remote warfare campaign where 80+ states are part of the US-led Anti-ISIS Coalition. Nevertheless, remote warfare operations have caused both direct and indirect civilian harm. This thesis studies how the US and Dutch governments discursively respond to the claims made by civil society about direct and indirect civilian harm caused by local security partners during Operation Inherent Resolve from 2014 until 2021. A critical discursive approach will be used to analyze two case studies of Operation Inherent Resolve: The United States and the collaboration with the Syrian Democratic Forces, and the Non-Lethal Assistance program of the Netherlands. By studying to what extent these two governments use epistemic politics when responding to claims of civilian harm caused by their partnerships with local security forces, this thesis provides a broader look at critical discourse analysis, where there is also a focus on what is not being said. Collecting data through public governmental sources, reports by human rights organizations, and public media sources, this thesis concludes that the United States and the Netherlands both use epistemic politics as a dominant discursive strategy when responding to claims of civilian harm caused by their partnerships with local security forces. Therefore, this thesis shows that it is important to not only analyze discursive strategies where words are being used but also to analyze discursive strategies where not much is being said at all when governments want to maintain power over the ‘truth’ that they have claimed."

External cues can influence the accessibility of certain pre-generated options, thereby increasing the likelihood of selecting them. Consequently, priming seems to not only enhance the accessibly of these options but also their desirability. However, when individuals need to generate options themselves because pre-generated ones are unavailable, it becomes important to examine whether priming still affects the accessibility and desirability of options. This study aimed to investigate the impact of priming through option generation in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of decision-making processes. It was hypothesized that priming would affect the accessibly of options but would not affect their desirability. To test this, an online experiment was conducted, involving a visual prime, to assess its effect on the accessibility and desirability of types of take-away food. Data were collected from 90 participants, who were randomly assigned to two conditions: India and Italy. A 2 (prime condition: India versus Italy) x 2 (food type: Indian versus Italian) x 2 (measure: accessibility versus desirability) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a nearly significant, reversed three-way interaction, F(1, 88) = 3.695, p = 0.058. Reactance could potentially explain this reversed effect, as participants might have been aware of the prime stimulus and deliberately chosen not to indicate a food preference aligned with the country they were primed with."

Researchers often found that the origin of all peptides eluted from cancer cells could not be mapped, which suggest that the tumor alters the translation process to generate new peptides that are presented in the MHC-complex on the cell surface. Obviously, this finding opens up a totally new area for cancer specific biomarkers. Here we present our pipeline to identify these non-canonical (cryptic) peptide candidates from RNA count data."

This research aims to build a framework to analyze how an increase of green human capital leads to cleantech innovativeness and what can be done by policymakers to help this process. To build this framework, multiple methods are used. Patents, demographics and policy reports are studied and linked to relevant scientific literature to discuss the case of the Cleantech Regio in detail. The results are presented in a SWOT-analysis to provide an overview of the situation. Reoccurring themes in the strengths and opportunities are close triple helix collaborations and the creation of innovative clusters, while weaknesses and threats are for example identified in a lack of focus on the cleantech sector and insufficient green education. The SWOT-analysis and subsequent conclusion and discussion helps policy makers with improving their green innovative capacity with a green human capital approach and for future research this paper serves as a guideline for further cleantech innovativeness analyses."

everyday life, ranging from driving a car and remaining alert to when the car in front brakes, 
to work environments that require employees to continuously attend and monitor automated 
systems for long periods of time. However, our ability to sustain attention can fluctuate over 
time, and lapses of sustained attention can have serious consequences, such as drops in 
attention leading to road accidents. Also, attentional deficits are central to a number of 
psychiatric disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD) and 
schizophrenia. As such, there is growing scientific and practical importance in having the 
ability to predict lapses of sustained attention before the lapse occurs using signals from the 
brain. Previous research has shown that lapses in visual sustained attention is associated with 
reduced frontal P3 amplitudes before a lapse occurs. Researchers have suggested these 
findings indicate that the frontal P3 is a neural mechanism that reflects endogenous (topdown/higher order) attentional processing that can track the timing structure of the task. 
However, no study to date has examined the brain signals that may show predictive 
characteristics of lapses in auditory sustained attention. This study examined the electrical 
signals from the brain that may predict lapses of auditory and visual sustained attention. 
Specifically, this study examined whether lapses of auditory sustained attention were 
associated with reductions in frontal P3 amplitudes before the lapses has occurred, as has been 
consistently shown with visual sustained attention. 
The present study provides the first evidence to show both lapses of auditory and visual 
sustained attention are associated with reduced frontal P3 amplitudes before the lapse occurs. 
Also, our findings show that exogenous (stimulus-driven) attentional processes do not support 
auditory sustained attention during the CTET, as has been observed during the visual CTET. 
These findings provide support to the interpretations that the frontal P3 is an endogenous 
(higher order) attentional mechanism, and lapses of sustained attention during a CTET 
paradigm only affects endogenous (higher order) attentional processing. The theoretical 
considerations of the current findings are discussed in regard to previous cognitive theories of 
the frontal P3. Future research should further examine the electrical activity that could predict 
lapses of auditory sustained attention using the CTET, starting with alpha oscillations."

Although research suggests that organizations can often deal with rapid change, many organizations and institutions were caught unprepared. Usually, this is not a problem as it often only affects a single company. However, the pandemic affected the whole global market. This study aims to provide insights and recommendations incorporating the changing norms and work practices of Small-Medium-Enterprises in The Netherlands during the Covid-19 pandemic and how these changes affected the employees’ experience and well-being, with emphasis on the effect of digital technology shifts. Following a literature study, organizations from different sectors in The Netherlands were interviewed and surveyed. Managers from four organizations were interviewed and 33 eligible survey responses were gathered from employees. Results reveal that organizations were heavily affected during the pandemic and implemented a large number of tools and technologies. Participants of the interviews and survey reported an increase in efficiency and productivity due to the changing norms, work practices, and technology uptakes that took place. These changes, however, did
not always improve the performance of organizations and the well-being of their employees. We conclude this thesis with recommendations on how organizations can improve their processes, as a result of the lessons learned during the pandemic. Our recommendations include proposed changes in the implementation time, the shift in communications, the streamlining of the employee’s overview, and the improvement of accessibility, availability, motivation, and energy."

The study utilized three prototypes (RAPP, ARAPPV and ARAPPN-V) which incorporated no cues, verbal cues and non-verbal cues, respectively. A within-subject design was used with a sample size of N = 13. Results indicated that anthropomorphism improved usability in ARAPPV (verbal condition) and ARAPPN-V (non-verbal condition) and task efficiency in ARAPPV. However, there were no significant results found in terms of credibility and trust. Qualitative results suggest that the stability of the

But can robots apply the same persuasion techniques, and what is the effect of their appearance on it? 
In order to study the effect of appearance on persuasion, this study compares two types of robot appearances: a humanoid and a non-humanoid.
Eighteen groups (N=54) engaged in moral collective decision-making scenarios.
During the trials, it was measured how persuasive the robot was by comparing individual choices, robot arguments and collective decisions.
There was no effect of appearance on persuasion across both conditions. 
However, the non-humanoid robot was considered to have a higher level of autonomy, contradicting most studies on robot appearance and autonomy.
Regardless of appearance, participants conformed to the robot and the most dominant human equally.
Although the robot was objectively persuasive, the robot was not perceived to be by the participants.
This discrepancy might have been caused by an effect seen in other HRI studies.
The perceived different levels of autonomy might have been caused by the expectations set by the humanoid and non-humanoid robot.
Future research should focus on validating objective persuasion measures, and discovering other important types of social cues for persuasive technology."

Cancer liquid biopsies target these fragments, but as the ctDNA concentration in the blood can be very low, sensitive sequencing technologies are needed. CyclomicsSeq is a novel sequencing technique that uses rolling circle amplification to generate multiple copies of a cfDNA fragment in a long concatemer. They are sequenced with Nanopore sequencing and the consensus sequences for all cfDNA fragments can be used to detect tumour variants and to infer the tumour fraction. The sequencing error rate for Nanopore sequencing is still quite high, but with consensus calling of the multiple cfDNA copies, random sequencing errors are removed. However, systematic sequencing errors remain even with consensus calling. Here, we present a deep learning model that is trained on Nanopore sequencing data. The model can perform accurate consensus calling for CyclomicsSeq and can find tumour variants in ctDNA fragments at a low variant allele frequency."

To support cardiac angiogenesis more effectively, we propose that an extended-release window of these factors is necessary. The aim of this study is to create a cell-free extracellular vesicle-laden hydrogel system that releases extracellular vesicles over such an extended period (14 days).

Whether they be democratic or autocratic, a president’s legitimacy is commonly attributed primarily to their performance. In the case of Chinese president Xi Jinping, however, ideology’s relevance should not be underestimated: with the publication of Xi Jinping Thought in 2017, he further validates comparisons between his and Mao Zedong’s ideological and propagandistic styles and the continued relevance of ideology in Chinese politics. This thesis investigates the role of ideology in Xi’s presidential legitimation, focusing specifically on green leadership: through comparative critical discourse analyses between general and environmental elements of his domestic and international speeches, it studies which legitimating strategies are employed and what these say about Xi’s leadership identity. Using different strategic narratives towards different audiences, Xi’s speeches reveal two overarching yet increasingly assertive ideological legitimation strategies: stressing his role as the nation’s ideological father domestically, whilst internationally emphasising his role as leader of the developing countries and alternative to the United States’ leadership. This international role bleeds into his approach to environmental governance, for which Xi similarly promotes his environmental ideology from a position of opposition to the developed countries."
Predicting harmful algal blooms through a combined modelling approach,"['Halteren, Machiel van']","['Hautier, Y.']",2023-02-17T01:01:05Z,EN,[],Environmental Biology,"The increasing intensity and frequency of harmful cyanobacterial blooms due to climate change and anthropogenically induced nutrient input is a well-studied and documented issue. Within the Netherlands, a protocol is in place to guarantee the safety of bathers based in part on cyano associated chlorophyll-a concentrations, measured in situ. Weather effects such as wind speed, precipitation or irradiance affect cyanobacteria presence. To increase the efficacy of the protocol measures and efficiency of the measurements a forecast through a combination of mechanistic models is proposed in this research. The combination of models should be able to translate weather forecasts into accurate and precise results of cyanobacteria presence. The combined models are ECMWF forecasts, the physical lake model General Lake Model (GLM) and the ecological model PCLake+. 50 different forecasts of ECMWF are used as input for GLM, which together provide input on water temperature, evaporation, wind speed, irradiation and precipitation for PCLake+. The important output variables of the models together will be a forecast on cyano associated chlorophyll-a and total chlorophyll-a concentration. Historical data as input for the models resulted in accurate model results for GLM. PCLake+ modelled a total chlorophyll-a concentration accurately but on cyano associated chlorophyll-a the accuracy decreased markedly. The effect of weather forecasts translates well to the total chlorophyll-a variance. Uncertainties concerning weather events present in early forecasts but removed in later forecasts resulted in a decrease in variance in the output. Future improvements on the combined models should focus on modelling the correct dominant group of algae. A suggested improvement to the model is an inclusion of a weather dependent groundwater model. Once the model is improved, the cyanobacteria forecasts can help improve the efficacy of Dutch water management practices."

This thesis analyses the performance of Linkage Tree Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary
Algorithm (LT-GOMEA) on Tree Decomposition Mk Landscapes for problems
generated by the benchmark function CliqueTreeMk introduced by Thierens et al. [16].
To understand the challenges faced by LT-GOMEA on these landscapes, the search process
is visualized using Local Optima Networks (LONs) introduced by Ochoa et al. [13].
Problems are generated in both a random and deceptive-trap codomain, and the input
parameters for CliqueTreeMk are varied to create problems with different characteristics.
The main parameter being varied is the overlap between subfunctions, and the
number of subfunctions increases as well to maintain a constant problem length. Two
implementations of LT-GOMEA are tested: the standard population-based version and a
non-population-based version in which the building blocks are learned from a hill-climbed
population. For population-based LT-GOMEA, the performance for both codomains increased
prior to decreasing with an increase in overlap, but the deceptive-trap codomain
performed better at higher overlap. This is thought to be due to a lower number of local
optima (than for the random codomain) and decreased deceptiveness with an increase
in overlap. The non-population based LT-GOMEA had similar results for the deceptivetrap
codomain, but performed poorly on the random codomain with overlap higher than
0, suggesting that an evolving population is necessary to utilize the linkage learning of
LT-GOMEA. We also discovered that the intended deceptiveness of the deceptive-trap
codomain decreases with overlap, and this could also contribute to the increase in global
optima for the deceptive-trap neutral codomain. The findings about the challenges faced
by LT-GOMEA are supported by analyzing the search process through the use of LONs.
The LONs reveal that problems generated with the same input parameters can vary significantly
in difficulty, and gaining a deeper understanding of the reasons behind this
variance could improve the effectiveness of CliqueTreeMk as a benchmark function, by
being able to more precisely estimate the difficulty of the generated problems."

The research findings highlighted how concepts of mothering and motherhood were articulated and experienced by pregnant women. The emotion of fear and anxiety were predominant in pregnant women, and both of them stemmed from the risk of potential enactment of obstetric violence in case a pregnant woman was COVID-19 positive during the last month of her pregnancy. Another form of violence that caused fear and anxieties was the fear of COVID-19 vaccination slow violence,from potential implications to the development and health of the fetus.

While most of these infections are rapidly neutralized by immunity, severe infections can occur and lead to death. Furthermore, various S. aureus antibiotic resistant strains have emerged which are now challenging the main treatment method. The alternatives to antibiotic treatments are slim: Despite decades of research, there are no vaccines against this pathogen. Host immunomodulation remains an attractive option for treatment development. However, while the bacterial virulence factors contributing to severe infection have been extensively researched, there is still much to learn about host factors affecting S. aureus infection to start treatment development. Inborn errors of Immunity are mutations which affect immune responses, and several were proven to predispose patients to severe S. aureus infections. Their study offers a powerful tool to assess the importance of specific immune genes in anti-S. aureus immunity, which directly nourishes research into novel therapies against Staphylococcus aureus. In this review, all evidence of human genetic predispositions to S. aureus have been assembled and examined. A majority of the identified IEIs predisposing patients to severe staphylococcal disease highlighted the importance of neutrophil recruitment in preventing bacterial dissemination and thus severe infection. These IEIs were found to affect mainly the development and function of neutrophils themselves, the TLR and IL-1R – NF-kB signaling pathway and T helper 17 immunity. Interestingly, non-traditional and non-haematopoietic IEIs were also identified – which urges researchers to discuss the approach to take in the coming years."
Neuropathology and Neurological Manifestations in ME/CFS and Long COVID with focus on Post-Exertional Symptom Exacerbation: a Literature Review,"['Rodenburg, Sanne']","['Middeldorp, Jinte']",2023-03-14T13:54:45Z,EN,['Long COVID; ME/CFS; PESE; Neuropathology'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Many of the people that get infected with the Coronavirus develop long-lasting complaints and are diagnosed with Long COVID after the acute infection is gone. These complains can last several months or years and include fatigue, cognitive impairment, sleeping problems and post-exertional symptom exacerbation (PESE). Research shows that COVID-19 patients with an acute infection have abnormalities in their brain, which could potentially lead to long-lasting neurological problems and symptoms. However, although many researchers are trying to uncover the underlying mechanisms, Long COVID is still very new. The underlying mechanisms causing and maintaining the disease are therefore unclear. A large group of Long COVID patients resembles patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) in terms of symptoms and, in many cases, the viral trigger of the disease. A core symptom of ME/CFS is PESE, which is uncommon in other fatiguing illnesses, but frequently seen in Long COVID patients. PESE involves an abnormal worsening of symptoms and cognitive and physical functions after any type of normal activity. Because of the large symptom overlap and lack of knowledge regarding PESE, underlying brain-mechanisms associated with Long COVID and ME/CFS in general as well as after physical exertion were investigated. The findings of this review indicate that ME/CFS is associated with several abnormalities in the brain which are also proposed to be present in Long COVID patients. Such abnormalities include inflammation of the brain, shrinkage of the brain and less blood flow to the brain. After physical exertion, these abnormalities might be exacerbated in ME/CFS patients. This results in a brain that needs to work harder than the healthy brain to complete a task. It is demonstrated by increased brain activity in several brain regions after physical exertion and general symptom exacerbation. Since the two diseases seem to have a large overlap in symptoms and underlying brain-mechanisms, this finding might apply to patients with long COVID as well. Importantly, Long COVID seems to consist of different subgroups of which a large part fulfills the criteria for ME/CFS. Treatment and therapy for ME/CFS patients is therefore likely transferable to this subgroup of Long COVID patients, with explicit attention towards the PESE phenomenon. More research is needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms as well as correct treatment approach of these diseases. Future research should take subgroups of Long COVID into account."
The Route to a Bionic Human Heart - How far are we and how far can we go?,"['Bas, Menno']","['Nelemans, B.K.A.']",2023-03-15T01:01:05Z,EN,['human heart; cardiovascular diseases / failure; heart transplantation; biomimetics; bionics'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"Diseases targeting the heart or vascular system of the human body are very common. Specifically, heart failure and heart attacks are the leading causes of death around the world. A human heart that is at the end of treatments becomes eligible for a real heart transplantation. This implies the replacing of the failing heart with a healthy donor that just passed away. These surgeries are not happening regularly and cost a lot of time and money. Due to the key function of the heart in the body are the possible diseases and other complains quite extensive. For example coronary artery diseases (when the blood vessels of the heart itself are being affected. Also, arrhythmia’s and valve diseases are common. The discipline of biomimicry/biomimetics is asked for advice about a successful artificial human heart, also called a bionic heart. Every element of the heart could theoretically have a biomimetic alternative. A total artificial heart is a mechanical device that is powered by an external battery pack that the patient must carry with at all the times and mimics the function of a natural heart by pumping blood through the body. This raises an ethical debate about the limitations of technology in healthcare. Nevertheless, very promising is the device of BiVACOR, an Australian company that is developing a bionic heart. However, it appears that mimicking a multifunctional and complex tissue is still very challenging and will need more research and development. While a bionic heart cannot fully replicate all the functions of a healthy human heart, it can offer a promising treatment option for patients with severe heart disease, helping to improve their quality of life and overall cardiovascular function until a real donor heart becomes available. Because a natural heart still remains the best option for transplantation."
Impacts of mega-event-driven development on urban transit systems and user experiences: A comparative study of four Olympic host cities,"['Burrows, Gráinne']","['Otsuki, Kei']",2023-03-15T01:01:17Z,EN,['mega-events; mega-event-driven development; mega-event syndrome; urban transport; Olympics transport; focusing event; transport white elephants'],Sustainable Development,"This thesis investigates the transport component of mega-event driven development through the case studies of four former Olympic host cities: Athens (2004), Beijing (2008), London (2012) and Rio de Janeiro (2016). By comparing each city’s baseline scenario with the transport changes that were promised in its bid to the IOC and those then implemented in the lead-up to the Games, the catalytic effect of Olympics-hosting on improving a city’s transport - particularly public transport - infrastructure will be outlined. The impact of these Olympics-driven changes will then be investigated, through an analysis of the effect this had on the longer-term trajectory of each city’s transit system and the behaviours and perceptions of those that interact with it. This is uncovered through an analysis of transport-related media reports published before, during and after the Games (to gain an understanding of reported public opinion); academic and grey literature on the Olympics’ transport legacy (including policies that were introduced during the Games and maintained or tightened afterwards, or transport lines that were built for the event and extended after it was over); and available public opinion surveys on their perception of these transport changes. Through comparison across the four case studies, this thesis concludes that Olympics-hosting does spur the rapid development of a city’s transit system, especially the coverage and capacity of its public transport network. However, this comes at a cost - in terms of public finance (especially for small or lower/middle income countries); opportunity (with money spent on, e.g., new airport-to-city centre connections or venue-to-venue lines that might better serve the local community if used on other projects); and equity (with new lines not affordable for, or useful to, all residents). This impact is correlated with each city’s baseline scenario, with those that have more limited infrastructure at the time of bidding experiencing the most rapid developments in their transport system, but also more likely to experience the aforementioned costs."
Impact of chemically defined media conditions on the production and regenerative function of mesenchymal stem cell‐derived extracellular vesicles,"['Sievers, Eva']","['Vader, Pieter']",2023-03-15T01:01:03Z,EN,"['Extracellular vesicle production, mesenchymal stem cells, culture media formulation, cardiac repair']",Science and Business Management,"The use of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have gained much attention because of their therapeutic potential for cardiac repair. However, their translation to the clinic is dependent on overcoming challenges, such as large-scale extracellular vesicle (EV) production. Although serum starvation is a widely used technique to increase EV production, it remains insufficient for large-scale production. On that note, a chemically defined medium for high density cell culture (CDM-HD) is believed to increase MSC-EV production in hollow fiber bioreactors; however, no comparative analysis has been performed between EVs from CDM-HD-cultured MSCs and starved MSCs in 2D cell culture systems. Therefore, this project aimed to assess the effects of culture conditions with CDM-HD on the production of human fetal MSC-EVs, and whether these EVs are functional. For the comparative analysis, EV yields from MSCs cultured in Opti-MEM or MEM-α with 10% CDM-HD supplementation or without (starvation) were determined using nanoparticle tracking analysis and western blot analysis. EV functionality was assessed using a scratch wound assay. The results showed that when compared to their starvation counterpart, Opti-MEM with CDM-HD (OM+CDM) resulted in the highest EV yield with a 9.6-fold increase within 24h, whereas within 48h, MEM-α with CDM-HD (M+CDM) increased EV yield with 17.2-fold. Regarding EV functionality, M+CDM EVs were able to induce endothelial cell migration; however, minor differences were observed with the procedural control. Taken together, culturing with CDM-HD increases EV yield to a greater extent than serum starvation. However, M+CDM EV functionality should be further explored to realize its potential as therapeutic agent for cardiac repair."

This is also reflected in reduced pleasantness ratings of affective touch, a particularly gentle form of interpersonal touch processed by C-tactile (CT) afferents in the hairy parts of our skin. While prior research suggested that deficits in interoception mediate this relationship between AN symptoms and the perception of physically experienced affective touch, little is known about the association between AN symptoms and ratings of affective touch when watching it vicariously. In a community sample of sixty-five women, this self-report based online study investigated whether the relationship between subclinical AN symptoms and pleasantness ratings of videos depicting affective touch was dependent on touch velocity (slow CT-optimal touch versus fast CT-nonoptimal touch), and whether the relationship would be mediated by interoceptive awareness (IA). It was found that IA indeed negatively mediated the relationship between AN symptoms and vicarious CT-optimal touch perception but not CT-nonoptimal touch perception. These findings suggest that altered IA may partly explain the association between AN and vicarious touch perception, providing evidence for a further generalizability of social anhedonia and the potential mediating involvement of interoceptive deficits."

However,
it is not yet understood how elements begin to cycle through the lithospheric mantle during
subduction infancy and how they initially affect mantle composition and thus slab-mantle interface
rheology. Progressive development of a “mature” forearc mantle wedge above a subducting slab
typically results in melt and fluid metasomatism in the upper plate’s lithospheric mantle, often
thought to drastically change original (micro)structures and rock chemistry. Ophiolitic complexes
provide a window into the chemical and structural evolution during the earliest stages of formation
of a subduction interface in the supra-subduction zone (SSZ) mantle wedge. The Mont Albert
Ophiolite Complex (Québec, Northern Appalachians, Canada) is an ideal locality to study the
slab-mantle interface, because the contact zone between the down-going crust (Iapetus Ocean)
and upper-plate lithosphere (Laurentia) of an Ordovician subduction zone is well-exposed.
Focusing on the upper plate mantle, I combined field-based structural observations, optical and
electron microscopy, and bulk rock major and trace element geochemistry to investigate the
structural and metasomatic changes occurring in the immediate hanging wall during subduction
initiation. At the “Mantle Wall” locality, serpentinized peridotites exhibit a strong moderately
dipping foliation across a ~100 m structural section, in an apparently in-tact orientation relative to
paleo-subduction and obduction. Microstructural observations demonstrate the degree of
serpentinization decreases with structural height above the paleo-plate interface. Geochemical
tracers including Cr#, Rare Earth Elements (REE) and Fluid Mobile Elements (FME) demonstrate
that the tectonic setting of original mantle was in an abyssal setting, the extent of melt extraction
from the mantle is heterogeneous (between 5-15% over ~60 m of structural section), and
serpentinite metasomatism did not impart a systematic chemical overprint to the rocks. I infer that
the peridotites underwent limited melt-reactions and limited FME-enrichment during
serpentinization after subduction initiation, and the differences in apparent depletion pre-date
subduction. Preservation of original lithospheric complexity in an infant subduction zone
demonstrates that mantle wedge chemistry is heavily dependent on the maturity of the fore-arc.
The late-stage serpentinization opposes the notion that serpentine is essential in subduction
initiation. This study rather illuminates the preservation of original mantle heterogeneity in the
form of original compositional layering, which may play a role in strain localization during
subduction initiation. Combining chemical analysis with structural field context appears critical to
accurately characterize the composition of a SSZ mantle wedge and understand its evolution."
"The Triangular relationship between European Arrest Warrant, Charter of Fundamental Rights and Hungarian law","['Posta, Sandy']","['Graat,']",2023-05-02T13:44:10Z,EN,[],European Criminal Justice in a Global Context,"As of 7 July 2021, § 1, § 3, § 9, § 10 and § 11 of the LXXIX Act of 2021 entered into force.   It prohibits both natural and legal persons of sharing any content with minors “that propagates or portrays […] divergence from self-identity corresponding to sex at birth, sex change or homosexuality”.  Thereby criminalizing certain acts under LXXIX Act of 2021, as defined under § 189 and § 208 of the Hungarian Criminal Code. Punishment of which may amount up to five years of imprisonment.  Despite scientific evidence to the contrary,   Hungary justified its action by referring to the Constitution, aiming to protect children’s physical, mental and moral development. 
Consequently, numerous actors raised their concerns regarding the possible legal implications in particular violation of article 11 CFR.   It became clear that, LXXIX Act of 2021 does violate article 11 of the CFR including freedom of expression of persons limited by the Act and children’s freedom to receive information.  As freedom of expression is not an absolute right, possibility of derogation was assessed. However, Hungary did not meet the legal grounds for derogation, as it did not meet the criteria– provided for by law, proportionality (legitimate aim, suitability, necessity) and preservation of the essence of the right – under 52 CFR. 
After such violation was established, the issue of EAW. What if Hungary issues a EAW for a person prosecuted based on LXXIX Act of 2021? Would mutual recognition oblige the other MS to execute the EAW, or would the MS’s obligation to protect FR (freedom of expression) suspend the obligation to execute the EAW? First, it was established that under article 2 of the FD EAW, a EAW may be issued to demand the surrender of a person being prosecuted under LXXIX Act of 2021, as the maximum sentence attached to it is five years, which exceeds the one year minimum. Followingly, an assessment was made, whether the FR exception would be extended to article 11 CFR in relation to LXXIX Act of 2021. It became clear that despite the principle of mutual trust and mutual recognition under article 1 (2) of the FD EAW, protection of FR exception may be extended to article 11 in relation to LXXIX Act of 2021, as it perfectly fits with the past cases of the CJEU and within the argumentations, as it is easily interchangeable with the other FR articles, especially the LM and X & Y cases concerning non-absolute rights.
As per the aforementioned arguments, violation of article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union by § 1, § 3, § 9, § 10 and § 11 of the LXXIX Act of 2021 can indeed serve as a legal basis not to execute a EAW issued for the purpose of prosecuting a person under LXXIX Act of 2021."

Highlighting the need for a more fundamental understanding of the cellular and molecular dynamics emerging from psychedelic experiences, for the treatment of anxiety","['Modafferi, Mattia']","['Batalla Cases, Albert']",2023-05-02T00:01:48Z,EN,[],Neuroscience and Cognition,"This paper provides an overview of the current state of psychedelic research, with a particular focus on the potential role of psilocybin in the treatment of anxiety. While the effects of psilocybin are highly dependent on experimental protocols and procedures, animal biobehavioural research remains an indispensable tool for investigating the compound's therapeutic potential. Animal models can shed light on the mechanisms underlying the compound's effects on molecular, neurobiological, physiological, and behavioural processes, and inform the development of corresponding pharmacological interventions. However, the complexity of human psychology represents a major impediment to the translation of animal research findings into clinical practice. In addition to animal research, an integrative framework that combines psilocybin's acute effects with psychotherapeutic interventions is necessary for the treatment of anxiety. Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of an ongoing dialogue between researchers, clinicians, and other stakeholders to ensure that scientific findings are effectively translated into clinical practice. Ultimately, the paper argues that with careful research and clinical practices, it may be possible to harness the power of natural compounds to alleviate anxiety and improve mental health outcomes."
Missed opportunities for mangroves as nature-based coastal protection against cyclone damage,"['Dongen, Sebastiaan van']","['Bouma, Tjeerd']",2023-05-02T13:44:15Z,EN,[],Science and Business Management,"Many coastal communities undervalue the natural defense system mangrove forests provide against cyclone storm surges.

Especially considering the increase of tropical storms intensity due to climate change, a better understanding of the value of such natural defense mechanism is urgent. To uncover the value of this protective function mangrove forests, a comprehensive dataset on cyclones that occurred in all cyclone basins between 2005 and 2019 was established, and the association between mangrove forest area and damage caused by cyclones in terms of property, crops and livestock in US dollars was determined. The results indicated that this association was not statistically significant. The most plausible explanation for not finding a negative significant association is the suboptimal placing of mangroves in the areas studied. Hence, this study’s findings imply that coastal communities need to adapt their coastal planning in such a way that more mangroves are placed between the urbanized area and the ocean if they want to grasp the opportunity these ecosystems provide as nature-based coastal defense."

In social dilemmas, group rationality and individual rationality impose tension against one another as rewards for one mean less or no reward for the other. As such, investigating how individuals are manipulated to perform certain strategies is important to understand. This understanding of cognitive mechanics can help support us better in the development of automated systems. We performed an experiment where we utilized the Prisoner’s Dilemma payoff matrix as a reward framework to determine what the effects of prior knowledge are during a 2-alternative forced choice social dilemma task on the response speed and bias on actions. We manipulated participants during the experiment by repeatedly informing them of the current standings after a set amount of trials, with the intent for individuals to change strategies based on what they are told. For the observed data, we have fitted a Drift-Diffusion model which tells us the effects of prior knowledge on effects in starting points or bias. The outcomes suggest that, although minimal, individuals are affected by the information they are given, as decision strategies start cooperative, but shift towards more defective choices as information is accumulated."

have experienced a remarkable comeback in recent years. As a result, numerous modern communication
standards have embraced LDPC codes. To achieve high processing speed and energy efficiency, both the
encoding and decoding processes must have a low level of complexity.
LDPC codes can be represented graphically by Tanner graphs. Tanner graphs with a large girth are often

It has a large influence on the long wavelength gravity field and topography of Mars. The leading theory on the origin of the volcanic region is a combination of both isostatic flexure of a thickened crust and a small contribution due to a large superplume residing in the upper mantle. The isostatic balance, on which previous studies have relied, does not adequately explain the long-wave length gravity field spectra. Our current understanding of the Martian mantle structures is insufficient to explain the observed gravity field. Using mantle dynamic models we explore the effect that an actively rising mass anomaly like a superplume has on the gravity field over time and if this signature would be measurable in gravity missions to come. We ran a series of instantaneous axis-symmetric finite element models of Mars with varying plume and structural parameters constrained by Nasa’s InSight mission. We ran the model for a time-step of 50 years, simulating the duration of future satellite data acquisition. The deformation in the model allows us to calculate the change in dynamic topography and the gravity anomaly resulting from the plume. Our results show dynamic topography rates of a few centimetres per year and gravity rates in the order of 0.1-1 µGal per year. We also compared different numerical profiles used to describe the internal structure of Mars (based on both pre- and post Insight constraints) to show the importance of the radial viscosity profile. Our findings agree with the current understanding of dynamic topography for a hot upwelling plume but show the importance of the viscosity distribution when looking at dynamic topography and gravity anomaly rates. The analysis of the three different numerical profiles showed that should the Martian mantle be highly viscous than the gravity anomaly of a mantle plume might not be measurable unless we measure for 10-50 years with high accuracy and precision. This study shows that the prolonged monitoring of the Martian gravity field could supply evidence for ongoing mantle activity in the Thar sis region and could even help us constrain the radial viscosity profile. Further research on the best-fitting plume and tests within elasto-viscous models is needed to give an estimate for the true size of a the gravity anomaly rates we expect for the Tharis region."

Our stable isotope
 mixing model reveals that for D. labrax, flatfish sp. are the largest contributors to their diet, followed by Clupea harengus, Carcinus maenas, and Cragnon cragnon. For C. labrosus, their main prey items appear to be the macroalgae Ceramium rubrum, followed by Corophium sp., and green microphytobenthos. For both fish species, the prey preferences derived from this study’s stable isotope mixing models differ from those obtained from stomach content prey frequency analysis from the same sampling group. This could be a result of the temporal differences in the data retrieved between the techniques and the partially migratory nature of both fish species, amongst other reasons discussed. A comparison in the stable isotope values between D. labrax caught in three regions in the Dutch Wadden Sea - Terschelling, Balgzand, and Eierlandse Gat - reveals their diet is more similar between Eierlandse Gat and Terschelling in comparison to that in Balgzand. Our results also show D. labrax and C. labrosus length and sex had a significant influence on tissue δ13C values, but not on δ15N values. This suggests similar trophic level feeding but differing spatial foraging habitats between fish of differing lengths and sexes. A secondary aim of this study was to determine whether the dorsal fin stable isotope signature was more correlated to that of the species’ liver or muscle SIA. Fin tissue is preferable for SIA over liver or muscle tissue because the non-lethal nature of fin tissue collection means it can be applied for the diet analysis of tagged fish. For both fish species, fin tissue δ¹³C and δ15N were more correlated to that of muscle than liver tissue."

Additionally, this study sought to identify the association of (patient) characteristics and (environmental) factors with the predictions made by intellectual disability physicians.
Method: This study was conducted using data from a double-blind randomized control trial of 88 participants. At baseline, practitioners predicted the success of withdrawal from antipsychotic medication, and these predictions were compared to the outcome of the withdrawal at week 22 to calculate positive and negative predictive values. A binary logistic regression was used to calculate the effect of nine factors on the expectation of the ID-Physician.
Results: ID-physicians, caregivers, and behavioral scientists exhibited positive and negative predictive values of 63.6/27.3%, 71.0/44.4%, and 69/-%, respectively. The presence of autism spectrum disorder and movement disorder(s) decreased the odds of the ID-Physician predicting a successful outcome of the withdrawal, with odds ratios of .167 and .025, respectively. No other factors or characteristics were found to significantly influence their prediction.
Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that clinicians' predictions were not reliable enough to be used for decisions about withdrawing antipsychotics. Only autism and movement disorders showed a significant correlation with predictions made by ID-physicians. Other patient factors, environmental and pharmacological factors had limited to no effect. The development of a predictive model could help clinicians make decisions when considering antipsychotics withdrawal."

The theories upon which this study is based are diffusion of innovations theory, platformization theory, uses and gratifications theory, and participatory culture theory. To investigate how BookTok has impacted the reading experience and engagement of users, this study incorporates evidence from two thematic content analyses, one focusing on videos from the For You page of TikTok and the other focusing on videos under the hashtag #itendswithus. The findings show that BookTok creates a digital space where like-minded readers can interact and react to books. The BookTok community engages with books by: (a) analysing and interpreting them, (b) expressing their themes creatively, (c) discussing and criticising their film or TV adaptions, (d) evaluating them, and (e) organising and documenting them. Moreover, most videos on a reader’s For You Page fall under the response/evaluation theme of book engagement, which shows that readers are highly likely to find their next read by simply scrolling on TikTok and coming across book recommendations. Finally, it is observed that romance is the most popular literary genre on TikTok.

The 90-day postoperative complication rate and pathological complete response (pCR) rate were compared using log-binomial and Poisson regression.
Results: 664 patients were included in the SCRT-direct surgery and 238 in the SCRT-delay group. After IPTW, the 90-day postoperative complication rate was comparable between SCRT-direct surgery and SCRT-delay (40% vs. 42%, RR = 1.1 [95%confidence interval (CI): 0.9; 1.3], p=0.6). pCR occurred more often following SCRT-delay than following SCRT-direct surgery (10% vs. 0.3%, RR = 39 [95%CI: 11, 139], p < 0.001).
Conclusion: Real-world evidence could not confirm an advantage in postoperative complications following SCRT-delay compared to SCRT-direct surgery, but did confirm the increased pCR rate following SCRT-delay. SCRT-delay followed by a response assessment should be offered to patients who are interested in watch & wait strategy. SCRT-direct surgery still is a valid option for patients who prefer surgical management."
Participation in International Cooperative Initiatives (ICIs) – Incentivising and Enhancing Local Non-State Actors in Sustainable Transitions in the Global South.,"['Diprima, Gianmarco']","['Chan, Sander']",2023-06-01T00:00:50Z,EN,[],Sustainable Development,"As the world faces sustainability challenges due to the effects of climate change, the global environmental governance landscape is striving to implement innovative solutions that can restore ecosystems. Due to the alarmingly limited capacity of national governments to guide society towards safe pathways of climate adaptation and mitigation, a wide range of non-state and subnational actors are increasingly engaging in the pursuit of this goal. Research investigating the effectiveness of non- state and subnational efforts is still limited and mainly concerned with estimating mitigation potential, often capturing their impact only in terms of greenhouse gas emission reductions. This research contributes to the discussion by examining the role of International Cooperative Initiatives (ICIs), which involve non-state and subnational actors working across national borders to steer society towards a common goal. The potential of these actors lies in their structural elements, i.e., multi-level governance and transnational reach, which can foster their success. However, as the design of these institutions is often studied through an exclusive governance theory lens, the literature is limited in understanding the role of ICIs in achieving sustainable goals involving sectoral transitions and in understanding how ICIs can deploy their role in society to incentivise and enhance local collective action. This study develops a broader approach to examine the role of these actors. The analysis framework integrates governance concepts with insights from transition theory. Implementing this approach through a combination of methodologies, i.e., a large-N survey and a small-N study involving desk research and case studies, it explores the practices that ICIs deploy to promote purpose-driven collective climate action and enhance existing local efforts. The selected case studies are located in the Global South, where local communities are most at risk of extreme weather events and interventions are most urgent. The findings contextualise the role and potential of ICIs by analysing ongoing transitions in the agri- food, healthcare, and forest management sectors. In particular, the research looks at the requirements that local actors have to fulfil in order to be part of these international networks, the engagement of ICIs with local actors and the social platforms that have been built, and the perceived benefits of ICI representatives and their participants in belonging to these networks. In the light of the results, the research finally discusses the opportunities that emerged to stimulate and enhance climate action by local actors and highlights the common weaknesses that appeared empirically from the case studies considered."
Ocean Afforestation's effect on deep-sea biogeochemistry,"['Lanjouw, Merel']","['Sulpis, Olivier']",2023-06-01T00:00:54Z,EN,['Ocean afforestation; blue carbon; modelling; deep sea; biogeochemistry; climate change; carbon dioxide removal; seaweed; geoengineering'],Marine Sciences,"If climate change is left unchecked it will lead to unprecedented deterioration of human health, economy 
and ecology. According to the IPCC, in order to avoid severe consequences, global warming will need to 
be limited to 1.5°C. However, the 1.5°C warming will be exceeded if current trends continue, which is 
why the need for Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) has become increasingly apparent. Ocean afforestation 
is currently one of the most promising CDR approaches, with the least competition for space, high carbon 
sequestration potential and high technical feasibility. Ocean afforestation approaches attempt to sequester 
carbon by sinking seaweed to deep-sea areas. This research looks at the consequences of the seaweed 
input to deep-seafloor. An early diagenetic model called RADI is used to predict the fate of the carbon 
and the effect on biogeochemistry. The model was adapted to include new sources of sedimentary organic 
matter, such as seaweed (Sargassum, Saccharina, Macrocystis) and Sugarcane bagasse, which are currently 
considered potential candidates for ocean afforestation purposes.
Sargassum, an invasive free-floating species, has a large sequestration potential and is readily available. 
Sinking Sargassum in pulse, large amounts over short times, leads to high carbon retention in the sediment 
(up to 25% after two years) but leads to hypoxic conditions in the sediment for at least two years after 
addition. Continuous Sargassum sinking also leads to carbon sequestration but with a much less invasive 
impact on the seafloor. The carbon from continuous sinking does not remain in the sediment but is 
remineralized and flows out to the bottom water as inorganic carbon. Saccharina, an edible coastal species, 
could be used to grow on free floating organic buoy. Having the additional sequestration benefit from the 
carbon fixed in the organics. Carbon retention is highest for the pulse addition of this seaweed (33% after 
two years), compared to a continuous approach (30%) in which the seaweed is added over longer 
timescales in small amounts. Since this pulse input also leads to hypoxic conditions in the sediment, the 
continuous approach is more favourable for this approach. Macrocystis, the giant kelp known for forming 
ecosystems, is a fast-growing coastal species. This species requires harvesting and baling for use in carbon 
sequestration. Carbon retention is much higher for pulse addition (30%). Sugar cane bagasse is an 
agricultural residue with high carbon content. Sinking this residue to anoxic basins, has been proven to 
retain more carbon than in oxygenated bottom waters. This can be confirmed with the results which 
showed a carbon retention of up to 50% after two years. The effect on the benthic biome is also less 
intense since the low oxygen conditions already necessitate a specialized microbiome. Sugarcane bagasse 
is furthermore the only addition capable of increasing bottom water pH. Whereas all seaweed approaches 
had higher dissolved inorganic carbon than alkalinity flow to the bottom water, resulting in net 
acidification. This research provides a first look into the effects of ocean afforestation on deep sea 
biogeochemistry, and illustrates the importance of the composition, quantity and input duration of the 
seaweed used."
A systematic review of first trimester prediction models for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM),"['Liu, Zhiwen']","['Schuit, E.']",2023-06-01T00:00:56Z,EN,['gestational diabetes mellitus; prediction; models; risk of bias assessment;'],One Health,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to perform a systematic review of available obstetric first trimester prediction models based on maternal characteristics for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
METHODS: The review included a comprehensive search of following electronic bibliographic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE from July 1st 2017 until September 30th 2021. Prognostic models published before April 1st 2017 were obtained from a previously conducted reviews. 
The studies were considered eligible if they met the pre-established criteria as follows: (1) the article must describe either the development or external validation of a prediction model, or an update to a previously developed model; (2) the model in question must contain multiple predictors; (3) the predictors used must be routinely collected in Dutch Obstetric Care; (4) the predictors must be available and/or measured prior to 16 weeks and 0 days of gestation; (5) The study population must comprise pregnant women; (6) the model must be based on weighted risk predictors that have been identified through multivariate analysis; and (7) the model must be used to predict the GDM outcomes.
Data was collected through a pre-determined data extraction form, which included specific items related to study type, domain, outcome, development and validation, model performance (measured by AUROC), risk of bias, and applicability. To evaluate the risk of bias and applicability, the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) was utilized. The systematic review adhered to the PRISMA guidelines for reporting.
RESULTS: In this study, 24 studies on GDM prediction models were selected for analysis, with 12 studies retrieved from the latest databases after rigorous selection. The final analysis included 20 models developed for GDM and 57 models externally validated for GDM. The developing models demonstrated AUROC values ranging from 0.64 to 0.88 (mean), but their performance in external validation studies was slightly lower, with AUROC values ranging from 0.60 to 0.87 (mean). Compared to all other models evaluated, Nanda's model has demonstrated a relatively stable performance in terms of AUROC values across both self-validation and external validation (0.73-0.79). Which suggests that Nanda's model may be more reliable and consistent in predicting outcomes compared to other models.
CONCLUSIONS: By analyzing and summarizing existing literature, this study presents information on current GDM prediction models with maternal characteristics and offers suggestions on the selection of predictors for future models, serving as a useful reference for future model development and enhancement. The study's findings suggest that although the model developed by Nanda et al. shows promise for predicting GDM, the other models exhibit lower performance. As technology and research improve, we expect better GDM prediction models in the future."

Synthetic mRNA Delivery Platform for Ex Vivo Transfection of Natural Killer Cells,"['Brandenburg, Lisa']","['Caiazzo, Massimiliano']",2023-06-01T00:00:46Z,EN,['Gene delivery; NK cells; lipid nanoparticles; polymers; immunotherapy'],Drug Innovation,"Natural Killer (NK) cells are a promising approach for adoptive cell therapy (ACT) since they can initiate a strong cytotoxic anti-tumor response, as the result of a balanced interplay between activating and inhibiting receptors. Although NK cells are considered less toxic and possibly also more effective than T cells, making them a potent alternative for immunotherapy, clinical efficacy of NK cells may be limited due to a lack of solid tumour infiltration and tumour editing causing suppression of NK cytotoxicity. These issues may be overcome by optimizing the cellular phenotype with additional activating receptors or silencing inhibitory receptors, through genetic manipulation. Yet, current methods for gene transfection of NK cells are lacking in efficiency or they induce undesired toxicity or phenotypical changes in the cells. A well-characterized nonviral method for NK cell transfection is thus desired. Towards this end, this research describes the synthesis of cationic polyplexes and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for the efficient delivery of enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) mRNA to NK cells. Although positively charged mRNA-polyplexes were unsuccessful for NK cell transfection, even when combined with cellular uptake and endosomal escape enhancing peptides, LNPs proved to be a suitable mRNA delivery platform. Upon optimization of the LNP lipid composition, including the use of Lipid 5 as ionizable lipid and -sitosterol (instead of cholesterol) as steroid, as well as microfluidics optimization, transfection efficiency up to ~85% eGFP expression was reported for the KHYG-1 NK cell line. Ultimately, the optimized LNP formulation presented ~75% transfection efficiency in umbilical cord blood derived NK cells, with a 5.5-fold increase in fluorescence from eGFP expression compared to the next-best nonviral alternative for NK cell transfection, electroporation. The reported LNP formulation is an effective non-toxic method for gene delivery in clinically relevant NK cells and may thus provide a suitable platform of phenotypical NK cell optimization for adoptive cancer immunotherapy."
How Student Involvement in Rubric Formulation Correlates With Feedback-Seeking Behaviour,"['Giepmans, Celine']","['Hulshof, Casper']",2023-06-01T00:00:52Z,EN,['rubrics; student involvement; assessment; feedback-seeking behaviour; motivation; self-determination theory'],Educational Sciences,"This study investigated how the involvement of students in rubric criteria formation and other rubric-related metacognitive activities may increase feedback-seeking behaviour. Rubrics are helpful assessment tools, but without supportive classroom activities, they may not lead to self-regulating behaviour in students that allows for increased performance. Considering the self-determination theory, one can conclude that allowing students to contribute to the rubric formation may solve this issue. The current study has tested whether such involvement correlates with higher levels of autonomous motivation and feedback-seeking behaviour. This was done by the means of a survey asking after the students’ input in rubric criteria; whether they partook in other metacognitive activities relating to the rubric; their autonomous motivation; their display of feedback-seeking behaviour; and several control variables. Participants were students at Dutch colleges and universities. Correlation analyses and t-tests were used to determine the significance of these correlations. The findings reveal that metacognitive activities correlate with higher levels of feedback seeking, although no relationships could be found involving rubric input or autonomous motivation. The absence of these results are mostly ascribed to the limitations of the present study."

De VOC als werkgever,"['Schimmel, Rutger']","['Schellekens, Christophe']",2023-07-04T00:00:48Z,NL,[],Geschiedenis van Politiek en Maatschappij,"In deze scriptie is onderzocht of de komst van de VOC een divergerend of convergerend effect had op de maritieme arbeidsmarkten van Noord-India en Java. Om dit effect te analyseren is een uitgebreide analyse uitgevoerd van de plakkaatboeken en generale-zeemonsterrollen van de VOC. De analyse is opgedeeld in drie hoofdstukken waarin het beleid van de VOC, de onderlinge verhouding tussen Aziatische zeelieden en de rol van tussenpersonen worden belicht. Voor het onderzoek is het theoretische raamwerk van het 'historical-institutionalist' model van Wolfgang Streeck toegepast, dat de nadruk legt op de invloed van instituties op sociale en economische structuren.
De bevindingen uit het onderzoek werpen licht op de verzwakking van de onderhandelingspositie van de VOC als gevolg van personeelstekorten en de afhankelijkheid van Aziatisch personeel. Zowel in Noord-India als op Java speelden economische en sociale bouwstenen een belangrijke rol, die moeilijk te veranderen waren. In tijden van sterke onderhandelingsmacht slaagde de VOC erin om de voorwaarden voor de tewerkstelling van Aziatische zeelieden vast te stellen, zonder aanzienlijke aandacht voor de bestaande instituties. Dit resulteerde in een convergerend effect waarbij verschillende arbeidsmarkten op vergelijkbare wijze werden benaderd.
Naarmate de onderhandelingspositie van de VOC verzwakte, kwamen de oude instituties weer naar voren en moest de VOC zich aanpassen aan de gebruiken en eisen van de arbeidsmarkten. Het samenbrengen van zeelieden uit verschillende markten zorgde voor meer interactie en het streven naar gelijke arbeidsvoorwaarden. Uiteindelijk had de komst van de VOC onbedoeld een convergerend effect, maar de historische instituties bleken sterk genoeg om terug te keren naar de oorspronkelijke gebruiken.
In het 'Varieties of Capitalism'-debat sluiten de bevindingen van deze casestudy aan op het idee van divergentie. Onderzoek toont dat historische instituten dermate geworteld waren dat zij zichzelf konden herstellen toen de macht van de VOC af nam. Een vernieuwend inzicht in het debat over globalisatie is dat het argument van Van Rossum, die stelt dat VOC-schepen een smeltkroes waren voor globalisatie, in twijfel wordt getrokken. Onderzoek toont aan dat aan boort van de VOC-schepen veel spanning tussen Aziaten en Europeanen was wat, niet duidt op een vruchtbare omgeving voor uitwisseling van kennis en cultuur.  
De conclusie van het onderzoek wijst uit dat de VOC gedurende een bepaalde periode invloed uitoefende op de maritieme arbeidsmarkten van Noord-India en Java, maar dat de langdurige impact beperkt lijkt te zijn. Deze bevinding sluit aan bij de theorie van Streeck en onderstreept de substantiële rol van historische instituties de ontwikkeling van arbeidsmarkten."

Emphasizing the roles of hard and soft power in influencing change (Abril and Gault 2020), the study examines the importance of CDM, defines the concept, and explores cultural understanding and critical pedagogy in music curriculum design. In particular, the study asks: How do music educators and policymakers perceive the challenges and opportunities of incorporating culturally diverse music into the curriculum? To answer this question, the study implements an international survey targeted at music teachers and arts and music administrators, as well as informal interviews. The study also examines a curriculum example developed by the International Baccalaureate (IB) Foundation, which addresses the balance of hard and soft power in executing a curriculum.

The dataset includes responses from 40 survey participants and 10 interviewees. Survey data reveal perceptions, experiences, and challenges related to incorporating CDM and identify emerging themes and patterns, comparing perspectives across different countries and considering the implications for music education practice and policy. Factors such as educational backgrounds, lived experiences, power dynamics, and cultural contexts are examined.

The research contributes to our understanding of music education by providing insights into the perceptions of music educators and policymakers on CDM and it posits an original funnel of knowledge model that encapsulates lived experiences and explains how experiential backgrounds impact a teacher’s ability to engage in new growth areas. 

The study argues that to drive real change in music education, a multifaceted approach is required, including the commitment from policymakers, content creators, and administrators, as well as grassroots engagement from teachers and the development of flexible educational resources. This study offers insights into practical barriers and enablers, informs effective strategies, and promotes cultural diversity and inclusivity in music education."
The influence of genetics and incubation environment on stress responsivity in laying hens,"['Rooij, Petra van']","['Nordquist, Rebecca']",2023-07-03T23:00:47Z,EN,['Incubation environment; light during incubation; corticosterone; feathers; Dekalb White; ISA Brown; emergence test; stress; fear behavior'],Companion Animal Medicine,"The environment and incubation circumstances in which a chicken embryo develops are crucial to a chicken’s life, as those circumstances can affect the chickens’ welfare throughout its life and their ability to cope with stressors. Light during incubation may cause reduction in fear responses and a decrease in stress indicators. The level of corticosterone in the feathers represents an integrated measurement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity over a long period of time. This present research investigated the level of corticosterone in flight feathers and the latency to leave the start box during an emergence test to evaluate the effect of a light-dark cycle during incubation on two genetic lines of layer hens, the ISA Brown and the Dekalb White Leghorn. More specifically, the effect of the light incubation on the chickens’ behavior, fear responses, stress and welfare was investigated. In total 20 chickens were euthanized and four feathers per chicken were plucked. Flight feathers number 2 and 8 from the left and right wing were used. These feathers were visually observed on irregularities and weighed, and the length was measured. Corticosterone concentrations were measured in the feather vanes using an ELISA. In addition, an emergence test was performed on 38 chickens in order to assess fear and investigate the chickens’ adaptation to new environments. No significant difference was found in corticosterone concentrations between incubation treatments or genetics for different feathers. Fungi were found in a total of 40 feathers, which appeared to lower the corticosterone concentrations. The Dekalb white chickens had significant longer and heavier feathers compared to the ISA Brown chickens. During the first day of the emergence test, the Dekalb white chickens and the light treatment groups took longer to leave the start box. On the other test days no difference was found between genetics or incubation treatments. The time to leave the start box decreased each day, but it did not depend on treatment of genetics, as the day influenced the genetic differences. Based on this research, it has not been proven that the light during incubation can increase the chickens’ ability to cope with stressors compared to dark incubation. Further research for the corticosterone concentrations will have to be carried out with a larger sample size, with the feathers packed in the right way to prevent fungus, in order to make valid conclusions. Further research also needs to be carried out to conclude if the chickens are faster to leave the start box due to less stress, increased social motivation or because they habituated to the test."

The Origin of Investment Trusts in The Netherlands 1919-1939.

During that period the world was confronted with decreasing global trade, economic imbalances and political turmoil eventually leading to the catastrophe of WW2. This warrants thorough analysis of what happened and why, in order to draw lessons for policies today. This thesis examines change of the capitalist economy in The Netherlands during the interwar years. Economic depression and unemployment led to unprecedented state interventions, particularly in the labour markets by undertaking large public works. The government also imposed trade restrictions and tariffs and abandoned the gold standard. These measures could be characterized as a transfer of a liberal economy towards a coordinated economy. However, developments in the financial sector and how firms were financed remain under researched. This thesis contributes to this field of research by investigating the numerous Dutch investment trusts that were created following US and UK examples. Their contribution to financing the economy may in financial terms have been modest, but their nature and the motives of creation by their sponsors were paradoxically very liberal. Rethinking the period, research into the Dutch investment trusts leads to the conclusion that the overall economy became only partially coordinated. Well embedded, classical liberal traditions had survived under conservative cabinets and would further erode only after WW2."

At this conference the Netherlands employed scientists as diplomats, advocated for the coupling of environment and development, and bolstered the establishment of the United Nations Environment Programme. The actions of the Netherlands were fundamentally shaped by its domestic environmental movement, tensions within the Dutch government, and the global political dynamics of the time.
The Netherlands strived for the success of the Stockholm Conference, but did not play a leading role in it. Most often, the Dutch looked toward other actors for leadership, such as Sweden, the United States, and the Secretary-General of the Conference, Maurice Strong. Still, the country was one of the central Western actors of the Stockholm Conference and that conference’s preparatory period. The Dutch case shows how crucial that preparatory phase can be for small countries to contribute to the success of United Nations environmental conferences. This thesis therefore does not regard the Stockholm Conference as a singular event, but as a larger process taking place between 1968 and 1972."

Fremdkörper (2021), a performance devised as a sleeping ceremony by the Dutch artist duo
Boogaerdt/Vanderschoot. This research builds on Silvia Battista’s study on posthuman
spirituality in contemporary performance and her conceptualization of introspective theatre. I
posit this research in the current posthumanist feminist debates that aim to decenter “the
human” and advocate for transversal interconnections. I begin by examining Battista’s work
to explore the possibilities of conceptualising introspective theatre located in posthumanist
thinking. To expose the posthuman potential of introspective theatre, I establish four
dramaturgical tools of such theatre: introspective technology, immersion, atmosphere, and
posthuman relationality. The investigation of these tools renders visible the overarching
framework between these tools - the practice of posthuman ethics. I create an understanding
of introspective theatre as an experimental space wherein theatre-makers engage the
spectators as participants to practise posthuman ethics and modes of being together. Through
the case study of sleep, I set up a more substantial discussion on the use of introspective
technology. From a posthumanist perspective, I reconfigure sleep as a sacred act in its own
right and expand Battista’s theory by analysing daily practice; forming a foundation for the
analysis of Fremdkörper. I explore the ways sleep in Fremdkörper is not just represented but
actively practised as a modality of introspection. I argue that through sleep as introspective
technology, Fremdkörper allows a way of relating to the other through a process of
self-reflection. Fremdkörper makes explicit how cultivating post-anthropocentric care in
performance begins inside the body and inner perception of the spectator. I argue that
Fremdkörper reveals that the employment of introspective technologies creates an
experimental environment for practising affirmative ethics. Based on this, I claim
introspective theatre as an arena for practising post-anthropocentric care that emerges from
practising introspection, wherein the agency is not limited to human agency."
Consumer Energy Demand Distribution Forecasting using Clustering Strategies and Applications in Robust Peak Shifting with Batteries,"['Knops, Pieter']","['Akker, Marjan van den']",2023-07-11T00:00:52Z,EN,"['Clustering, Demand Forecasting, Distribution Forecasting, Peak Shifting, Battery Planning']",Computing Science,"In recent years, the electric grid is becoming increasingly overloaded. At the same time, dependence on electric energy is growing, and production is becoming less plannable and predictable due to a growing share in renewable energies. 
To alleviate the resulting peak stresses on the electric grid, we perform peak shifting using batteries at the neighborhood scale. The (dis)charging schedules are based on a self-made hourly consumer demand forecasting approach.
The LSTM architecture is proposed for forecasting, and compared to an LR approach. Instead of a point-forecast, we implement a distribution forecast, allowing for accurate modelling of the stochasticity of consumer demand. Clustering is used for efficient training, and improved by our ReClustering technique, in which consumers are reclassified based on forecasting performance.
For planning batteries, we use 5 or 10 Tesla Powerwall batteries for peak shifting the hourly demand of the 500 consumers at hand. We propose and prove optimality of a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the offline case, and evaluate different strategies in the online approach, in which a rolling horizon approach is used to solve for a time horizon of 24 hours into the future. A variable battery reserve is included in our proposed approach.
Our LSTM forecasting technique outperforms the shift (a persistence model) and linear regression approaches. Clustering significantly improves results. ReClustering also contributes to improved results.
Our battery planning algorithm outperforms the baseline approaches that do not use our forecasting approach, but only when the information in the percentiles of the distribution forecast are used for deciding on battery reserve, showing one of the advantages of distribution forecasting over point forecasting."
The Desire (Not) to Rule. Platonic Thymos and the Philosopher's Motivation to Rule in the Republic,"['Larrinaga Marquez, Iñaki']","['Bonazzi, Mauro']",2023-07-08T00:00:40Z,EN,['Return to the cave; Philosopher kings; Kallipolis; Reason; Spirit/Thymos; Tripartite soul; Desire; Motivation; Compulsion; Justice; Happiness; Contemplation; Courage'],Philosophy,"The problem of what motivates the philosophers in Plato's Republic to consent to return to the cave (by compulsion) has received a lot of scholarly attention in the past century. This is a big problem in the text because, on the one hand, justice, which is supposed to bring more happiness compared to injustice, requires that the best element of the city and soul (the philosophers and reason, respectively) rules the inferior elements; on the other, Socrates unremittingly emphasizes that the philosophers don’t desire to rule and that said reluctance is a necessary condition for the philosophers to be the best rulers possible. This problem, usually called “the return to the cave problem”, is really important, for not only does the existence of Kallipolis need the philosophers to rule, but because this creates an apparent contradiction in the text: to be happy, one must be a philosopher, for that leads to justice; but being a just philosopher means that you need to rule, which is something the philosopher despises, implying that the philosopher would be happier by being unjust and not ruling. This leaves the reader with the impression that maybe Plato's defense of justice fails.
Some commentators have tried to solve this issue by claiming that, within the tripartite psychology of the Republic, a desire to rule can be found in the philosophers' reason. The hypothesis of this thesis is that, once we read the text closely, it becomes apparent that this current dominant interpretation cannot be correct; rather, the text points in the direction of spirit (thymos) being the source of motivation for the philosopher’s descent."
From Idea to Product: Requirements Evolution within Software Projects,"['Berg, Nikita van den']","['Dalpiaz, Fabiano']",2023-07-11T00:00:55Z,EN,"['Requirements evolution, requirements engineering, requirements change']",Business Informatics,"Requirements evolution is a phenomenon that has been acknowledged and recognized, but
not extensively researched yet. It has been widely known that requirements change is one of
the most persistent challenges in the software industry. Having such a closely related field be
seen as a persistent challenge, and the fact that researchers have been calling out for more
research on the topic, emphasizes the necessity for research on requirements evolution. In
this study, we delve deeper into requirements evolution through an exploratory case study,
supported by a literature study.
In the literature study, we encountered various definitions and taxonomies on the topic,
from which we developed a taxonomy of requirements evolution. In the case study, we
closely followed the progress of an internal software project from its initiation until the
creation of a minimum viable product. We collected all requirements and requirementsrelevant information, tagged it, and create sequences of changes that represent the evolution
of a requirement. Our analysis focused on identifying evolution patterns, combinations of
associated tags, and the influence of timing, source location, and initiators on requirements
evolution. Lastly, we investigated the similarities and differences of requirements evolution
between the contents of conversations and those of project management systems.
We discovered some evidence that irreversible changes are less likely to occur, and we
observed a correlation between stakeholders’ roles and the requirements evolution steps they
initiate. Furthermore, this correlation appeared to be linked to the company’s working
methodology, as revealed through stakeholder interviews conducted during the case study.
Finally, we analyzed the recorded requirements conversations, and their connection to the
documented requirements evolution from the project management system. We found that
these conversations need to be analyzed on a different granularity level to be effectively
utilized, and that there were differences in the occurrence of different tags between these
discussions and the requirement management system."
The Creative Role of Session Musicians in Popular Music: A Case Study of Michael McDonald’s “I Keep Forgettin’”,"['Verwaart, Simon']","['Capitain, W.H.P.']",2023-07-08T00:00:43Z,EN,['session musicians; studio musicians; popular music; analysis; creativity; authorship; michael mcdonald; steve lukather; jeff porcaro; louis johnson; greg phillinganes; los angeles; groove; improvisation'],Applied Musicology,"In this thesis, I provide an analysis of Michael McDonald’s “I Keep Forgettin’” (1982) with the aim of gaining insight into the creative role and contributions of the session musicians playing on the track. In my analysis, I use an approach formulated by Zagorski-Thomas focusing on the activities that produced the music. I show how the session musicians contributed not only through the musical ideas they provided, but also by shaping the track’s distinctive groove, and by adding many details that give the track its individual character. In doing so, they played a vital role in the creation of the track. With this thesis, I contribute to the growing body of research on the influential role of session musicians in popular music by providing a detailed example of how session musicians contribute to a track. My findings underscore the fluidity of creative roles and the complex nature of authorship in popular music. The demonstrated effectiveness of the approach I used provides a starting point for further studies of session musicians and other actors in the creative process of record production."
Playlist Pitching and Corporate Power Relations,"['Revet, Margot']","['Ahrendt, Rebekah']",2023-07-07T14:00:50Z,EN,['playlist pitching; Spotify playlists; music industry; corporate power relations; record labels'],Applied Musicology,"The digitization of music has raised concerns in the music industry that industry power relations, historically dominated by major record labels, would be challenged to create more opportunity for independent players. Streaming services like Spotify have heightened this fear by positioning themselves as the new musical gatekeepers by placing in-house curated editorial playlists at the forefront of their interface. While there is extensive research on the qualities and effects Spotify playlists have on song streaming performance and audience engagement, there is little research exploring how songs are chosen for editorial playlists, and how major and independent labels’ relationships with Spotify may influence these decisions. This paper investigates how corporate power structures of the music industry are maintained through practices like Spotify editorial playlist pitching, examining the dynamics between Spotify and record labels, and how past industry practices have been adapted to the world of streaming. The research involves interviews with music industry insiders to gain first-hand perspectives and information on pitching practices and Spotify-label dynamics. I argue that labels leverage Spotify’s need to filter new, relevant releases by sending playlist pitches for songs that are relevant to the local market. When done well, playlist pitches can strengthen the relationship between Spotify and labels and help to maintain a label’s negotiation position relative to other labels. In conclusion, this project, by closely examining playlist pitching in the music industry, sheds light on Spotify-label relations and how the size of the label and its music catalog can have an impact on industry power relations in the current and future landscape of music streaming."

This is researched by answering the main question: to what extent did the Holy See use soft power to influence the political position of Dutch Catholics between 1903-1929? This question provides insight into the academic debate surrounding the concept of power by testing the conceptual clarification created by Joseph Nye through historical research. In addition, this research also provides depth to the historical debate surrounding the relationship between the Holy See and Dutch Catholic politicians. A link between the Holy See and Dutch politics between 1903-1929 is visible in the objectives of the Holy See, as defined in their encyclicals, and the reactionary actions of Catholic politicians in the Netherlands. This relationship is visible in Dutch newspapers, House of Representatives meetings, and political party programs. The research demonstrates the complexity of testing soft power against the backdrop of political realities. Soft power is difficult to differentiate from hard power in many cases, and the presence of soft power elements do not always guarantee political influence."

The influence of proficiency-based progression training on peri-operative and survival outcomes in robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for endometrial cancer: an observational cohort study.,"['Sickinghe, Ariane']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-07-18T00:01:29Z,EN,['Baarmoederkanker; robot-chirurgie; complicaties; survival'],Selective Utrecht Medical Master (SUMMA),"Background: In the last years, the preferred approach in minimally-invasive surgery has shifted from straight-stick to robotic due to more precision, better views, reduced patient morbidity and improved surgeon ergonomics, which are especially beneficial in the increasing number of obese patients with endometrial cancer. An increased number of gynaecological oncology surgical fellowship programs have adopted robot-assisted laparoscopic (RAL) surgery as part of their training. SERGS and BIARGS developed proficiency-based progression (PBP) training curricula, but their effects on peri-operative and survival outcomes in endometrial cancer patients has not been assessed. 

The Royal Marsden Hospital is a tertiary cancer centre in the United Kingdom (UK) treating high-risk endometrial cancer patients and has been training subspecialty trainees in gynaecological oncology in RAL surgery since 2015 in a PBP training manner. 

Aim: To assess the influence of PBP training in RAL surgery for endometrial cancer on peri-operative and survival outcomes. 

Methods: This is an observational cohort study. All women with primary endometrial cancer treated with RAL surgery between 2015 and 2022 were included. PBP training cases were identified pre-operatively by consultant surgeons based on clinical factors, such as BMI and comorbidities, and case complexity matching the experience of the trainee. Main outcome measures were intra- and post-operative complications, blood transfusions, readmissions < 30 days, return to theatre and 5-year disease-free and disease-specific survival for training versus non-training cases. Mann-Witney U, Pearson’s chi-squared and multivariable regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of PBP training on post-operative outcomes. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analysis. 

Results: Training cases had a lower BMI than non-training cases (30 versus 32 kg/m2), but were comparable in age, performance status and comorbidities. Training had no influence on intra- and post-operative complications, blood transfusions, readmissions < 30 days and return to theatre rates. Operating time was longer in training cases (161 versus 137 min). Estimated blood loss, conversion rates, CCU-admissions and lymphoedema rates were comparable. No effect of training on 5-year disease-free and disease-specific survival was found.

Conclusions: Proficiency based progression training can be safely used to teach RAL surgery for women with endometrial cancer. Prospective trails are needed to further investigate the influence of distinct parts of RAL surgery performed by a trainee on endometrial cancer outcomes."

Zo denken de meeste mensen dat armoede toeneemt, terwijl dit niet het geval is. Ook is het idee dat de wereld verdeeld is in een kleine groep rijke westerse landen en een grote groep arme niet-westerse landen sterk aanwezig. Dit terwijl het gemiddelde inkomen in lage-inkomenslanden sinds 1970 meer dan verdubbeld is, de meeste mensen tegenwoordig in midden-inkomenslanden wonen en veel van de rijkste landen in de wereld niet westers zijn (denk aan Saoedi-Arabië, Japan, Zuid-Korea, Taiwan en Singapore). Deze beelden ontstaan deels doordat feitenkennis niet wordt bijgesteld aan nieuwe ontwikkelingen en deels doordat de beeldvorming van mensen sterk wordt beïnvloed door de media die over het algemeen onevenredig veel negatief nieuws laten zien.

The Knowledge Capacity and Epistemic Contribution of Social Pharmaceutical Innovation Actors,"['Brakel, Samantha van']","['Boon, Wouter']",2023-07-18T00:01:20Z,EN,['Social pharmaceutical innovation; knowledge; epistemic injustice; off-label use; pancreatic cancer; unmet medical needs'],Innovation Sciences,"Introduction | Unmet medical needs are still a problem for patients that suffer from severe diseases. Social Pharmaceutical Innovations are multi-actor collaborations that attempt to address these unmet medical needs. However, it is unknown how Social Pharmaceutical Innovation actors achieve this and what their individual contribution is to the knowledge of finding alternative medical approaches. Therefore, this thesis examines the process of knowledge creation, exchange, and application, or knowledge capacity, of Social Pharmaceutical Innovation actors and their epistemic contribution to this process. The aim of this thesis is to gain more insight into the management and execution of knowledge processes in Social Pharmaceutical Innovations. The case study of the off-label use of lidocaine on pain management for pancreatic cancer patients was used to represent this research.

Methods | Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with key actors of Social Pharmaceutical Innovations and hospitals. In addition, document analysis was performed on the case study of off-label use of medication and lidocaine.

Results | The findings showed that knowledge is created through the sharing and assessment of knowledge. Knowledge is shared internally through meetings, discussion, and dialogue, and externally through written publications and congresses. Newly created knowledge is applied in new or changed projects, protocols, or techniques. Furthermore, Social Pharmaceutical Innovations involve and include various actors with different perspectives, expertise, and experiences. They collaborate toward a shared goal of identifying and addressing unmet medical needs.

Discussion/Conclusion | The analysis of the results showed that the exchange of knowledge is a continuous process that goes back and forth and is interconnected with the creation of knowledge. This knowledge is eventually applied to new projects or techniques. This process is performed by multiple actors that work toward a shared goal and plan to identify and address unmet medical needs. Further research is necessary for an in-depth examination of this process in Social Pharmaceutical Innovations."
"Storing excess solar power 
in hot-water tanks on household 
level as power-to-heat system","['Kotte, Ivar']","['Sark, Wilfried van']",2023-07-18T00:01:24Z,EN,['Solar Energy; Tapwater; Energy Storage; Household Level'],Energy Science,"With installed solar power increasing rapidly in the Netherlands, interest in technologies that 
allow for the storage and usage of excess solar energy is growing as well. A new technology 
that serves this purpose is the Water Battery of the company Solyx Energy. This set-up 
utilises surpluses of solar energy to heat tap water for showering and cleaning, thereby
lowering gas use and leading to both monetary savings and reduction in CO2 emissions. 
The goal of this research was to create a model to analyse the effectiveness of the Water 
Battery in lowering energy costs for different types of households, especially with the 
planned termination of the netting system in the Netherlands. To accomplish this, the model 
simulates the average daily energy production and energy use per month of a household 
based on the household size and installed solar power. Based on these data, calculations
were performed for the yearly savings in energy costs by utilising the Water Battery. The 
model also performs this function for similar technologies, such as a home battery, a heatpump boiler, and a solar boiler. A multi-criteria analysis (MCA) was conducted in order to 
compare the benefits and drawbacks of all options. 
The results show that for households with limited installed solar power (for example 3 kWp), 
the Water Battery has little benefit while the present netting system is in place, but the 
benefits become greater as the netting system is gradually terminated. The early benefits 
can be increased for such households by utilising smaller water storage containers, although 
this limits savings when netting is no longer an option. For households with higher installed 
power, the Water Battery immediately leads to savings in energy costs.
When comparing the technologies, the Water Battery and the heat-pump boiler score 
highest in the MCA. The heat-pump boiler is the most effective at lowering gas use and 
energy costs, while the Water Battery has lower initial costs and allows use of more excess 
solar energy. This means that the Water Battery is a good choice for households that want a 
simple way to make better use of their solar energy production. While less effective overall 
than a heat-pump boiler, the Water Battery does allow for an easier bottoms-up transition 
towards sustainability."
Going down the biobased circular (recycling) economy rabbit hole,"['Roos, Mandy de']","['Worrell, Ernst']",2023-07-18T00:01:16Z,EN,['Biobased polymers; Circular economy; Transition; Plastic recycling'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The plastic petrochemical industry has created a linear economy, leading to global problems such as climate change. To diminish these problems, innovations in the recycling and plastic industry are happening, namely biobased polymers (BBP) and chemical recycling. Shifting to a biobased circular economy leads to the research question: How can the transition towards a biobased circular (recycling) economy be achieved? The transition is studied using the Multi-Level Perspective theory, mapping the three levels. For this, interviews are conducted with business associations/scientists for the landscape, novel BBP producers/chemical recyclers for the niche, and mechanical recyclers (including sorters)/petrochemical industry for the regime. 
Sub-question 1: What types of polymers will comprise the future market of biobased polymers? Drop-ins are made using biobased/recyclate added to crackers containing fossil oil, adding a percentage to create a BBP. On the other hand, novels are entirely and efficiently made from biomass and have added value. Challenges that favour drop-ins include the power of the regime, scale problems, and the high-cost price of biomass. Thus, it is not surprising that drop-ins will comprise the future market of BBP. However, optimally, the market should comprise more novel polyester BBP in the long term. 
Sub-question 2: What barriers and opportunities do (the identified future) BBP encounter when trying to fit into the recycling infrastructure for plastics? Novels face two main general barriers and opportunities, the barriers of the chicken-egg problem and contamination potential, the opportunities of scaling up recycling for a circular economy, and the recycling target of 40% set in the Dutch Transition Agenda for Plastic. Additionally, novels have three main chemical opportunities due to depolymerisation: low scale, low cost, and low energy usage. 
Sub-question 3: What solutions are (currently) available to overcome the barriers to fitting the future BBP into the recycling industry to create a circular economy? Five concrete policy suggestions are given: enabling collaboration, instituting CO2 pricing, investing in reuse, starting sorting/recycling novels, and adding a mandatory percentage of biobased content. 
To conclude, policymakers and governments need to use a system perspective to transition towards a biobased circular economy. Novel polyesters should be promoted due to their proven lower energy consumption, low persistence, and added value. Companies should be given the choice of using a mandatory recyclate or BBP by the Extended Producer Responsibility system. This combination has the highest CO2-saving potential and could stop the chicken-egg problem."

Het antwoord wordt gegeven in een vertalersportret naar Koster (‘vertalersportret’). Vier aspecten van de vertaler worden geanalyseerd, te weten: 1) zijn oeuvre; 2) zijn levensloop en loopbaan; 3) zijn poëticale opvattingen; en 4) zijn zichtbaarheid. Door middel van deze vier analyses kan tot een conclusie worden gekomen over zijn positie in het literaire veld, geformuleerd in termen van de (on)afhankelijkheid van de actor tegenover het veld. Bomans’ levensloop en loopbaan wordt extra uitgebreid beschreven, in een poging de specificiteit van zijn situatie recht te doen. Zijn diverse vertaaloeuvre, dat uit zevenentwintig (prenten)boeken, korte verhalen en toneelwerken bestaat, wordt geanalyseerd qua genre, brontaal, uitgeverij, jaar van uitgave van vertaling en brontekst en auteur, en waar relevant vergeleken met Bomans’ oorspronkelijk oeuvre. Bomans staat een doeltaalgerichte vertaalpoëtica voor, die het schrijverschap van de vertaler benadrukt, maar hecht groot belang aan respect voor de literaire kwaliteiten (indien aanwezig) van de brontekst. Bekend als Bomans was, zijn vertalingen zijn dat niet, en zij, alsook zijn vertaalpoëtica, heeft geen zichtbaar aanwijsbare invloed gehad.

The effect of inequality and gender on sustainablebehaviour,"['Obbink, Elisa']","['Barbosa Machado, W.']",2023-07-19T08:00:57Z,EN,[],Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems,"Climate change has in the last decade become more important and urgent. As its
consequences are harmful to the environment and humanity. The only way to slow this down
is by sustainable behaviour. However, there is a lack of involvement which cause governments
and organisations to look for solutions to promote sustainability. Literature suggests that
sustainable behaviour can be influenced by SES level but does not go into detail about this
possible effect. In addition, the moderation effect of gender is not researched in combination
with SES for the Netherlands. It is argued that women show more sustainable behaviour,
especially those with a high SES background and that the height of one’s SES background can
either positively or negatively affect their sustainable behaviour depending on the gender. It is
expected that those with low SES show less sustainable behaviour. Therefore, the purpose of
this research is to investigate the effect of SES on sustainable behaviour and if this is moderated
by gender.
Using the LISS dataset called “the energy transition from a citizen's perspective” from
2019. This is examined by performing a multiple linear regression analysis on N=2175 Dutch
citizen respondents.
Results are partially in line with the expectations. There is an effect found of SES on
sustainable behaviour but only when measuring SES through education. This states that low
SES individuals show the least amount of sustainable behaviour. Furthermore, results showed
no moderation effect of gender. However, there was found an effect of gender on sustainable
behaviour. This means that women generally show more sustainable behaviour as expected,
however, this is not a moderation effect on the relation between SES and sustainable behaviour.
These findings were used to form policy recommendations aimed at creating more awareness
and urgency surrounding climate change and sustainable behaviour."
