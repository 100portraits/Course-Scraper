Exploring Spatial-Temporal Patterns in COVID-19 Disease Data,"['Liempd, Bart van']","['Augustijn, Ellen-Wien']",2022-04-20T23:00:31Z,EN,"['COVID-19, Machine learning']",Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"The world is currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic. To be able to understand the scale of the outbreak 
and to respond appropriately, it is required to track the spread of the virus. Currently, this tracking is done 
with the use of either temporal or spatial data. This research proposes a method to combine both 
dimensions to be able to track COVID-19 differently. This method is called the Self Organizing Map (SOM). 
With the use of SOM five datasets are compared to each other. These datasets are the positive percentage 
of tests, positive percentage of inhabitants, virus particles in sewage water, deceased cases, and 
hospitalized cases. For these datasets, the change of the spatial situation over time and the distribution 
of the local temporal variations over space are analyzed. Furthermore, the different waves of COVID-19 
are compared to each other in the same way based on the virus particles in sewage water. In short, the 
positive percentage of tests and positive percentage of inhabitants showed nearly identical patterns. 
Hospitalized cases and deceased cases showed similar patterns, although not as similar as the datasets 
described above. The sewage dataset was the most similar to the hospitalized cases and deceased cases. 
To investigate this further, other methods should be used to evaluate the similarities. Primarily other 
clustering algorithms could provide a useful addition to the research."
ESE-BPA: An integrated qualitative process analysis framework,"['Evertse, Robert']","['Gulden, Jens']",2022-04-20T00:00:46Z,EN,['Qualitative business process analysis; Business process management; Green BPM; Environmental social and ethical accounting'],Business Informatics,"This master thesis aims to extend contemporary qualitative business process analysis methods with metrics from environmental, social and ethical accounting (ESEA) methods. As sustainability has become of increasing interest in business and practice, organizations have adapted ESEA methods to account for the non-financial impact of their actions. In the field of business process management, Green BPM allows for insights in resource usage, among other environmental externalities. It does not include social and ethical externalities. Therefore, metrics from ESEA methods have been adjusted and incorporated in a newly designed framework called environmental, social, and ethical business process analysis (ESE-BPA). ESE-BPA enables individual business processes to be analyzed in terms of their utilities, process demographics, and conflicts of interest, among other things. After performing ESE-BPA, organizations will have gathered business process redesign opportunities. This allows for organizations to adapt their business processes, as well as gathering insights in the internal workings and the transitions over time."
Paxlovid: The introduction of a novel anti-SARS-Cov-2 therapy on the Dutch antiviral market,"['Romano Olmedo, Kiri']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-04-30T23:00:33Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"In January 2020, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) was discovered in Wuhan, China after pneumonia outbreak occurred. The World Health Organization (WHO) later defined as Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) and officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. Since then, over 470 million cases have been confirmed and over 6 million people worldwide have passed away due to COVID-19. As a response to the pandemic, Pfizer has developed a covid vaccine and is marketing their novel anti-SARS-Cov-2 main protease inhibitor (PI) in 2022. Paxlovid achieves its antiviral effect by inhibiting an essential protease in the viral replication process. The 3CL protease digests polyprotein to produce a set of proteins that are vital for the virus replication and transcription. By inhibition of the SARS-Cov-2 3CL protease, the virus is unable to proliferate, and the infection is halted. This research aims to describe the COVID-19 pandemic from multiple perspectives, to illustrate the journey covid patients follow from symptoms development to treatment and recovery, to identify questions healthcare professionals have surrounding novel antivirals, assess where and who supervises the prescription of Paxlovid, and what role Paxlovid can play in the future of this pandemic.
This research includes historical comparison to the HIV epidemic, an overview of the novel SARS-Cov-2 pathogen, a summary of the current treatment protocols for COVID-19 patients, the effects of the vaccines on the progression on the pandemic, the Paxlovid product profile, and the opinion of healthcare professionals in covid care. A new patient journey will be illustrated to show which parties are involved in the implementation and prescription of Paxlovid. In addition, the unmet need and the role of Paxlovid will be assessed based on the current pandemic climate and the view of healthcare professionals (HCPs) in the field.
At present, treatment initiation happens only when patients are hospitalized, which rarely happens within five days since symptoms onset. In order to introduce Paxlovid in the patient journey, the initiation of treatment has to move to primary care, overseen by the general physician. However, the general physicians do not possess the expertise that pulmonologists and infectious disease specialists do. These experts should transition their role from overseeing the treatment to advising the general physicians in assessment of eligibility for the therapy and its prescription, based on guidelines provided by SWAB and other medical professional organizations. The role Paxlovid could play for covid patients largely depends on the danger the pathogen poses at present times, which is relatively low. HCPs indicated that there is a small patient population at the moment and thus unmet need that antivirals could fulfill is small as well. However, the unmet need those individuals with a high risk of severe disease progression experience might differ from the estimation that HCPs.
Healthcare should be accessible and inclusive, therefore highlighting the importance of Paxlovid to the high-risk patient community. To ensure adequate administration of this antiviral therapy within the first five days since symptom onset, the general physician takes on a bigger role than just the prescribing party and will be the central point of oversight in the patient journey. The medical experts, pulmonologists and IDSs, will take on an informative and supportive role for the general physician. Furthermore, policy makers, healthcare organizations and regulatory bodies need to provide HCPs with clear and concise information and guidelines on the antivirals. When these measures are in place, Paxlovid can help protect high-risk patients from severe covid symptoms and hospitalization."
The role of the excavating sponge Cliona celata in oyster shells,"['Kingma, Enzo']","['Reichart, Gert-Jan']",2022-05-03T00:00:32Z,EN,['Bioerosion; Excavating sponges; Cliona celata; Fluorescence microscopy; Grevelingenmeer'],Marine Sciences,"Excavating sponges are the most common and destructive macro-eroders present in carbonate dominated habitats, such as coral- and oyster reefs. These sponges penetrate in carbonate skeletons and shells, forming a complex network of tunnels and chambers. In temperate climates, their presence can pose a threat to services provided by oyster reefs due to weakening and damaging the oyster shells, which in the long term leads to loss of the reef structure. Sponge bioerosion proceeds by a combination of chemical dissolution and mechanical chip removal. However, the exact chemical conditions during sponge bioerosion are largely unknown. Here, we provided insights into the bioeroding mechanism of Cliona celata present in oyster shells collected from the Grevelingenmeer and the Oosterschelde, The Netherlands. By growing C. celata on pieces of Iceland spar (a pure transparent form of crystalline calcium carbonate) the conditions of dissolution at the sponge-CaCO3 interface were investigated. Using a pH fluorescent probe followed by fluorescence microscopy, we were able to show that the intracellular pH at this interface is lower compared to ambient seawater. This suggests active proton pumping and release of low proton bundles, to be responsible for creating an acidic microenvironment and hence promoting dissolution of CaCO3. Using a model based on the linear Heat-Diffusion equation, we estimated a local proton flux of 3.02 x 10-8 mol dm-2 s-1 towards the edge of the sponge tissue where etching takes place. Additionally, using scanning electron microscopy we showed that bioerosion by C. celata occurs in successive phases; from dissolution of lattice deficiencies, to etching marks that over time form well-developed pitted holes/tunnels and chips. 
This study adds to the understanding of the mechanisms that drive sponge bioerosion and provides more insight on how environmental conditions can affect calcium carbonate dissolution by excavating sponges as well as making predictions about future rates of sponge activity."
Cross(X)link Mapping and AnalySis (XMAS) – Smooth Integrative Modeling in ChimeraX,"['Lagerwaard, Ilse']","['Scheltema, R.A.']",2022-04-30T23:00:28Z,EN,['ChimeraX; XL-MS; XlinkX/PD; PhoX; DSSO; DSS; fibrin'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has demonstrated its ability to add tremendous value to structural biology investigations. Its main strength lies in uncovering structural information from proteins in the form of distance constraints between neighboring amino acids, even in particularly complex samples containing proteins with regions difficult to access by other techniques. However, interpreting XL-MS data in a structural context has been cumbersome, even though several approaches have been developed. Moreover, with the introduction of the highly flexible and widely used ChimeraX – a software package for visualization of structural data – XL-MS analysis tools previously available in its predecessor, Chimera, were lost. We therefore introduce XMAS, a bundle for ChimeraX that allows users to load results from several XL-MS search engines straight into ChimeraX and directly map the information onto protein structures. Besides automatically locating the distance constraints on the protein structure, XMAS offers the possibility to work with replicate experiments and/or different crosslinkers, and filter on reproducibility of distance constraints across replicates to increase the data quality. We additionally introduce the concept of self-links, which allows modeling of homomeric interactions. Furthermore, we implemented a seamless connection to the structural modeling suite of HADDOCK to ease difficult tasks in the structural modeling pipeline. Here, key functionalities of XMAS are demonstrated on data obtained from human fibrin clots. The software is freely available from the ChimeraX toolshed, with an extensive user manual for quickly grasping the functionality."
"Getting Targeted Therapies to Pediatric Patients: The iLTB  and the Pinocchio Study
GETTING TARGETED THERAPIES TO PEDIATRIC PATIENTS: THE ILTB AND THE PINOCCHIO STUDY","['Siemers, Maarten']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-05-01T23:00:27Z,EN,"['clinical trials, pediatric, pediatric oncology, oncology, NGS, Batch effects, database']",Drug Innovation,"Molecular profiling is becoming standard of care in pediatric oncology, leading to an increase in knowledge about genetic aberrations at the basis of cancer development and subsequently to an increase of Targeted Therapies. Interesting novel therapies include the Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors, Monoclonal antibodies, CAR-T cell therapies, and NK cell therapies. Approval for the usage of these novel targeted therapies in pediatric patients is lagging adult approval by a significant margin of 6 years. For this reason novel clinical trial designs in the form of master protocols are under development: to accelerate clinical trials in small subsets of pediatric patients. At the basis of a master protocol a profiling initiative molecularly profiles the patients and recommends enrolment into a specific clinical trial or a specific arm of a master protocol.
The International Leukemia Target Board (iLTB) is an European tumor board aiming to enroll all patients with a r/r hematological malignancy and no standard of care treatment option in Europe. After inclusion and discussion the iLTB recommends treating physicians the fitting clinical trials or therapies for their pediatric patient. For a molecular profiling initiative to work efficiently, a rigid framework to enroll the patient and store all their data is necessary. For this reason, iLTB database was designed and created. Several improvements on a standard clinical trial database design were thought up, considered, designed, and implemented to ensure a couple of core conditions: Easy enrolment of patients from anywhere in Europe, smooth data import and export, and, as a result, accelerating trial enrolment in small pediatric clinical trials.
Because of the absence of enough safety and efficacy data of targeted therapies in pediatric patients, targeted therapies are often not prescribed to them. In order to enlarge the current knowledge about the pharmacokinetics of targeted therapies in pediatric patients, the Pinocchio protocol was amended to also include Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors. The study design, study outcomes, informed consent forms and database were designed and written, and the protocol was submitted to the Medical Ethics Committee receiving conditional approval. As soon as final approval is granted, patient enrolment into Pinocchio Stratum 2 can start."
Assessing the Role of Cytokines in Psychosis Prognosis Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach,"['Schie, Bart van']","['Schnack, Hugo']",2022-04-30T23:00:31Z,EN,['cytokines; schizophrenia; psychosis; prediction; OPTiMiSE; machine learning; deep learning'],Artificial Intelligence,"Abstract
In this study, the role of cytokines in predicting treatment outcome of first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients will be assessed. 
Background: Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder in which early response to treatment is associated with improved prognosis. However, accurate prediction of treatment response is still a problem for modern psychiatry.
Aims: Investigate the predictive value of aggregate cytokine data in the prediction of FEP patients’ clinical remission.
Methods: Data from the OPTiMiSE cohort was used to predict clinical remission as a binary outcome. Using a deep neural network, remission was predicted for patients (n=309) undergoing amisulpride treatment for 4 weeks (phase 1). In addition, remission was predicted for patients (n=57) not in remission after phase
1, who then underwent 6 weeks of either amisulpride or olanzapine treatment
(phase 2).
Results: Cytokines performed better than chance in predicting treatment response for phase 1 (AUC = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.56-0.60, p = 0.024, permutation n = 1000) and phase 2 (AUC = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.59-0.75).
Conclusions: A data modality consisting of 39 cytokines performed better than chance in predicting FEP patients’ clinical remission. Although these findings are modest, they suggest that cytokines should be included in a multimodal approach to predict FEP patients’ treatment response."

tools to discover concept evolution and query with this concept evolution in mind. Each approach
does have its limitation. The application of these approaches tends to depend on the structure of
the data. Concept evolution in a data set can cause problems where historical data is missed when
querying because to the concept of the query underwent evolution. For these types of situation
rewriting a query based on the concept evolution in the data would mitigate those problems. We
introduce a system that creates a concept evolution graph based on the evolution in the data and
uses it to rewrite a query to take the evolution into account. Additionally we create visualisations
that help understand the evolution in the data and also specific queries."
Uncertainty of Porosity-Permeability Relationships from REV-scale Numerical Fluid Simulations,"['Zijlstra, Ruben']","['Zech, Alraune']",2022-05-19T00:00:33Z,EN,[],Earth Surface and Water,"Empirical porosity-permeability and grain size-permeability relationships have long been used and researched.
However, they often under- or overestimate permeability because they simplify complex micro scale porous
medium descriptions, such as tortuosity or pore size distribution, into nondescript parameters or constants.
This paper aims to highlight the large range of possible permeability values that can be obtained from identical
porosity and grain size distributions, but describe different pore scale porous media. To achieve this, numerical
flow simulations were performed on irregular grained and circular grained porous media which contain identical
grains and porosity but vary in spatial distribution of the grains within the domain. Subsequently, the domain
was analyzed in terms of representative elementary volume, pore size distribution, grain size distribution,
quantitative grain morphological parameters, porosity, and permeability. The results were compared to five
well known empirical relationships: Hazen (1892), Slichter (1898), Beyer (1964), Kozeny-Carman (1953), and
Barr (2001). Results showed a linear relationship between permeability on a logarithmic scale and porosity
on an arithmetic scale with uncertainty increasing as porosity increased. Porous media containing equally
sized circular grains as irregular grains in terms of sieve radius showed higher permeability values. Empirical
relationships correctly captured the impact of porosity on permeability, but were unable to yield correct values,
and even deviated by over a factor 10 for some porous media. This study emphasizes the need for more extensive research into pore scale processes influencing permeability and provides ideas for future research."
Mediterranean-based Diets and their Association with Cognitive Functioning in Dutch Community-Dwelling Older Adults,"['Reumerman, Maria']","['Biessels, G.J.']",2022-05-18T00:00:32Z,EN,['Mediterranean diet ; cognitive functioning;'],Biology of Disease,"Background: Lifestyle has become an important focus of brain health, due to its potential to delay cognitive decline. Previously, nutritional patterns such as the Mediterranean diet and the MIND diet have been associated with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment. However, there are still conflicting results regarding the effect sizes of these diets, warranting further research. Therefore, the aim of the current project was to analyze the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet, measured by the MEDI-LITE score (Mediterranean Literature score), and cognitive function in the NU-AGE Wageningen cohort.

Methods: Food records and cognitive scores were obtained from the NU-AGE Wageningen cohort, which was a one-year randomized dietary intervention study in healthy older adults (65-79 years). The MEDI-LITE score (ranging from 0-18) was calculated from seven-day food records and was analyzed as total score, as well as in separate food categories. Four cognitive domains were created from composite Z-scores of individual neuropsychological test battery scores. Linear regression was used to model the relationship between MEDI-LITE scores and cognitive scores, and p-values were adjusted for multiple testing.

Results: In total, 248 out of 252 participants had complete data available at baseline. The MEDI-LITE total score was negatively associated with episodic memory [β -0.05 (99% CI -0.11, -0.01), p=0.022], but this trend did not remain significant after adjustment. In the separate food categories, non-significant negative trends were observed between fish and executive functioning [β -0.29 (99% CI -0.62, -0.03), p=0.026] and episodic memory [β -0.23 (99% CI -0.52, -0.06), p=0.021]. Cereal intake showed a non-significant negative trend with episodic memory [β -0.33 (99% CI -0.73, -0.07), p=0.033].

Discussion & Conclusion: We did not find a significant association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cognition scores in the NU-AGE Wageningen cohort. Although some other studies have reported similar non-significant associations between the Mediterranean diet and cognition, there is ample evidence that this diet improves cognitive function and delays cognitive impairment. The non-significant findings in this report could have been the result of selection bias, reverse causation, the unvalidated analysis of separate food categories of the MEDI-LITE score or the lack of distinction between types of foods (e.g. refined or non-refined cereals). Future randomized trials with generalized scores and guidelines are necessary to confirm the association between the Mediterranean diet and cognitive functioning in older adults."
The association between short-term exposure to wood smoke and salivary cortisol – a panel study,"['Bergh, Emma van den']","['Hoek, Gerard']",2022-05-13T23:00:28Z,EN,['air pollution; wood smoke; levoglucosan; cortisol; stress'],Toxicology and Environmental Health,"Background: Ambient air pollution, has been described as a big contributor for increasing mortality rates. In the Netherlands approximately one million woodstoves and fireplaces are actively being used, resulting in roughly 1.100 million kilograms of wood being burned yearly. This contributes to a significant amount of wood smoke. Currently, the exposure to wood smoke in developing countries has been associated with high indoor air pollution concentrations and (respiratory) health effects. Several studies showed that exposure to wood smoke may be involved as a factor inducing changes in secretion of stress hormones, such as cortisol. However, in the Netherlands no studies have been conducted on this relationship. 
Aim: This study will investigate the short-term variation of cortisol (stress) in association with outdoor wood smoke exposures in adults with and without asthma and/or COPD. 
Methods: Our study is a panel study with repeated observations of the stress marker cortisol. Participants completed daily symptom reporting in a diary and provided three weekly saliva samples on one day (two in the morning and one evening sample) between February 13th 2021 and May 10th 2021 for cortisol determination. Exposure to wood smoke was measured daily at central monitoring sites in the four study areas (Bergen, IJburg, Zutphen and De Meern) where the study participants lived during the study period. Measurements include real-time measurements of 24-hour average concentrations of levoglucosan (the most specific wood smoke marker), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC) and ultrafine particles (UFP). Mixed linear models were used to evaluate associations between measured wood smoke exposure and cortisol.
Results: We included 46 participants in our study. The total amount of cortisol samples was 1519, evenly divided between the first morning sample (34%), second morning sample (33,4%) and evening sample (32,6%). More than 67% of all evening samples were below the detection limit of 1 nmol/l (332/495). For cortisol morning 1 and cortisol morning 2 there were only 6 samples below the detection limit. Levoglucosan exposure shows a median and 25th – 75th percentile of 8,3 and 4,3 to 19,2 ng/m3. Black Carbon (Ch 1-6) has a median and 25th – 75th percentile of 0,11 and 0,03 to 0,52 µg/m3. Wood smoke exposure had highly non-significant associations with cortisol in the morning, with no pattern of direction of association. In the evening and cortisol awake response (CAR) associations were negative but highly non-significant.
Conclusion: No consistent evidence for an association between salivary cortisol and wood smoke was found."
"The cerebello-hypothalamic tract: The relationship between estradiol, neuroticism, and cerebellar white matter","['Jansen, Maaike']","['Schutter, Dennis']",2022-05-15T00:00:30Z,EN,['Cerebello-hypothalamic tract; cerebellum; white matter; estradiol; neuroticism; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; PMDD'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Many reproductive aged women experience symptoms of Premenstrual Syndrome and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder. Nonetheless, research on the mechanisms behind these symptoms is limited. In the current paper, it is proposed that the steroid hormone estradiol is associated with these emotional symptoms, using neuroticism scores. In addition, it is expected that estradiol is related to cerebellar white matter volume, and the cerebello-hypothalamic tract (CHT). The CHT is a white matter projection, directly connecting the cerebellum with the hypothalamus. Data from a longitudinal cohort study at Leiden University Medical Centre, the “Braintime” project was used to examine the associations. MRI examinations were performed in twenty subjects, using a 3-tesla 3T unit, and the CHT was exposed using Diffusion Tensor Imaging. The CHT was found unilaterally in 11 cases (nleft = 9 and nright = 2), and bilaterally in 7 cases. However, no significant relations were found between estradiol and neuroticism, estradiol and cerebellar white matter volumes, and cerebellar white matter volumes and neuroticism. Nevertheless, a significant negative correlation was found between the CHT fiber count and white matter volume in cerebellar lobule IV. Furthermore, results showed that participants in which the CHT was found bilaterally scored significantly higher on the NEO-PI-R Depression scale. Hence, further research could examine whether there are significant associations between estradiol, white matter volume, and the CHT, taken age and individual ovulatory phases into account in data collection."
Pom152 limits NPC dilation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe,"['Govers, Jolijn']","['Förster, Friedrich']",2022-05-17T00:00:39Z,EN,"['Structural Biology, Cryo-Electron Tomography, Nuclear Pore Complex']",Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"The nuclear pore complex (NPC) bridges the inner and outer nuclear membrane and consists of a nuclear and a cytoplasmic ring that flank an inner ring. The inner ring is surrounded by a luminal ring predicted to be composed of the transmembrane nucleoporin pom152. The NPC is highly dynamic; previous research showed how nuclear envelope tension regulates constriction and dilation of the complex. Which nucleoporins are involved in regulating the NPC diameter has yet to be discovered. During dilation, the luminal pom152 ring changes drastically, forming a ring encircling the membrane closely and potentially regulating the NPC diameter. Here, I used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-ET) and live cell fluorescence microscopy to investigate the effect of pom152∆ on NPC diameter and nuclear volume during hypo-osmotic shock in cellulo. My findings show the limiting effect of pom152 on the NPC diameter and imply a nuclear leakage of hypo-osmotically shocked pom152∆ cells."
Unravelling the mechanisms underlying the induction and immunological function of tolerogenic dendritic cells by immunomodulators.,"['Veen, Heleen van der']","['Broere, Femke']",2022-05-17T00:00:32Z,EN,"['Tolerogenic dendritic cells, mechanistic studies, tolerance induction, immunomodulators, rheumatoid arthritis']",Drug Innovation,"Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are severe and common diseases that together affect ~3-5% of the population, and for which a new treatment strategy is needed. Current treatments are associated with side effects caused by broad immunosuppression, and are ineffective for some patients. Tolerogenic dendritic cells have the potential to induce antigen-specific tolerance and thereby restore the immune balance without side effects caused by broad immunosuppression. Tolerogenic dendritic cell-therapy is currently investigated in early-phase clinical trials. Tolerogenic dendritic cells induced using immunosuppressants have shown promising results in these clinical trials and other experiments. These include, dexamethasone, Vitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), and all-trans retinoic acid. However, the exact mechanisms through which these tolerogenic dendritic cells are induced, and through which they exert their immunologic functions are largely unknown. Therefore, with this proposal, we aim to study the molecular mechanisms underlying antigen-specific tolerogenic dendritic cell induction by dexamethasone, Vitamin D3, and all-trans retinoic acid. We will do this in both murine and human cells. In addition, we aim to study the effects of these induced antigen-specific tolerogenic dendritic cells on other immune cells and rheumatoid arthritis development in an in vivo model. The end goal of this research is to contribute to improving tolerogenic dendritic cell therapies and to contribute to finding the optimal tolerogenic dendritic cell strategy for specific autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis"

Rotation Methods for 360° Videos in Virtual Reality - A Comparative Study,"['Zeches, Leo']","['Hürst, Wolfgang']",2022-05-13T00:00:36Z,EN,['360° videos; panoramic videos; VR; rotation in VR; navigation in VR;'],Game and Media Technology,"Advances in VR technology enabled the development and distribution of 360° videos.
Also called panoramic videos, this type of media is shot from multiple camera angles,
forming a complete surround experience. Paired with a HMD device, this creates a fully
immersive experience.
For the majority of 360° video players, view point changes in order to explore all
viewing directions are often exclusively performed by head movements.
While this design helps greatly with immersion, it also creates some practical problems.
To explore the content of a video in all viewing directions, a viewer has to rotate their
whole body along the yaw axis. This is especially problematic if the viewer wishes to
remain stationary, for example on a non-rotating chair. In this case, the whole video
content can only be accessed by performing extreme head movements and straining neck
rotations.
This work focuses on implementing alternative rotation methods which allow a viewer
to fully navigate the content of a video while remaining in a stationary position and
while avoiding straining head rotations. To this end, three distinct rotation methods
have been created, each being a representative for a basic interaction concept. A GUI
method, which implements additional graphical user interface elements, a thumbstick
method, utilising a physical VR controller as input, and a dragging method, which uses
gestures for video rotation. These methods are then analysed and compared against
each other in a user study, focusing both on viewer performance as well as subjective
feedback.
The results show that while there is no complete elimination of head movement, nor
significant difference of it between the three rotation methods, every rotation method
allows a viewer to navigate the video content from a stationary position. Participant
feedback suggests that the Thumbstick method was best suited for this task. These results suggest that implementing the Thumbstick method into 360° video players provides
viewers with a powerful alternative for video navigation. The additional inclusion of the
Dragging method provides viewers with multiple options for rotation which accommodates different preferences."

"Seagrasses and coastal protection: The role of Halophila stipulacea in sediment stability at the coast of St. Eustatius, Dutch Caribbean","['Hee, Francine van']","['Reijers, Valérie']",2022-05-23T00:00:33Z,EN,"['Seagrass; sediment stability; sediment stabilisation; St. Eustatius, Halophila stipulacea;']",Marine Sciences,"Seagrasses are increasingly being recognized for their potential in protecting the coastlines from flooding and erosion. As ecosystem engineers, seagrass can attenuate waves and trap and stabilise sediment, causing the seabed to become more stable, which can contribute to coastal protection. Where many tropical countries lack the means to undertake traditional coastal protection measures, natural ecosystems (e.g., seagrass meadows) can provide cost-effective alternatives to protect coastal communities from natural hazards. The Caribbean region holds a large cover in seagrass relative to the coastlines, yet few studies have focused specifically on seagrass and sediment stability in this region. Over the last decades, native seagrasses have been degrading and the non-native Halophila stipulacea, originating from the Red Sea, has been spreading rapidly through the region relatively recently. A knowledge gap exists in whether this opportunistic species could provide essential ecosystem services, such as coastal protection, where native species have been lost. The extent to which seagrass species contribute to coastal protection services depends on the growth properties of these species as well as environmental conditions. Therefore, a need remains to study sediment dynamics in seagrass meadows in different scenarios. This study aimed to increase our understanding of the role of H. stipulacea in sediment dynamics, specifying on the coast St. Eustatius, Dutch Caribbean. 
Next to a literature review on sediment stabilising properties of seagrass species in the wider Caribbean region, an experiment was set up at a study site (18 m deep), in a monospecific H. stipulacea meadow, and in a sand patch within the meadow. Growth properties of H. stipulacea were measured, and sediment stability was investigated by measuring changes in seabed level over time, as well as using sediment traps to calculate the sediment deposition rate. Data on meteorological conditions was retrieved to investigate correlations between the weather and sediment change. 
Results showed that H. stipulacea at a depth of 18 m at the coast of St. Eustatius, grew a new shoot within 3.3 days, over twice as fast as measured for its native range. Average leaf length was 4 cm while 8 shoots were observed per strand. Similar values were observed in its native range. Although the leaf length was smaller than most native seagrasses in the Caribbean, H. stipulacea showed a higher density, which likely contributed to the findings of this study. Sediment deposition rate was much lower in the H. stipulacea meadow than in the sand patch, which is probably the result of limited resuspension within the seagrass meadow. After 14 weeks, sediment in the H. stipulacea meadow had eroded. This is believed to be the result of erosion of the surface sediment layer, a less stabilised layer of sediment that was potentially resuspended and carried away when the weather became more turbulent after months of calm conditions. The subsurface layer, however, is believed to be more stabilised by the root and rhizome system of H. stipulacea, which explains why smaller and relatively constant changes in sediment level were found after weather conditions had increased. The sediment level in the sand patch showed a larger variance over time and spatially between erosion and accumulation. This study showed that H. stipulacea seems to stabilise the subsurface sediment layer via its root and rhizome system, which is assumed to contribute to a more stable seabed. However, this result only became apparent after erosion of the surface layer and might even disappear with more extreme weather conditions. This study urges for future research to investigate the sediment stabilising effect of H. stipulacea at shallower depths as well as over longer terms, as different results might be found for different seasons."
In vitro neurotoxicity hazard characterization of exhaust–derived particulate matter in rat primary cortical cultures using micro-electrode array recordings,"['Leijer, Dirk de']","['Westerink, R.H.S.']",2022-05-20T00:00:34Z,EN,['Neurotoxicology; PM; UFP; MEA; diesel exhaust;'],Toxicology and Environmental Health,"Exposure to air pollution and particulate matter (PM) is linked to adverse health effects, including
neurodegenerative diseases. While underlying mechanisms are still unknown, epidemiological
studies have shown a strong correlation of these diseases with ultrafine particles (< 100 nm;
UFP), which are mainly derived from traffic-related air pollution. Due to the small size, UFP can
translocate to the brain through the cardiovascular system or directly enter the brain through the
olfactory route and may negatively affect the central nervous system. The size distribution and
chemical composition of traffic-related UFP can vary substantially between different types of
engines and fuels, which in return potentially alters the neurotoxic potency of emitted PM. Aiming
to shed light on the impact that different types of engine and fuel as well as UFP fractions have on
the neurotoxic potency of traffic-related UFP, we screened several diesel exhaust-derived UFP
and PM for their neurotoxic hazard.
UFP test samples where generated by light and heavy duty diesel engines fueled with high- or
low-aromatic diesel and the non-volatile and semi-volatile UFP fractions were collected on Teflon
filters. UFP samples were extracted and used for further neurotoxicity screening in rat primary
cortical cell cultures grown on multi-well microelectrode arrays (MEA). To do so, spontaneous
neuronal network activity was determined before and up to 120 h during UFP exposure (1-100
μg/mL and 1-20 L/mL). Additionally, cell viability was assessed after the final MEA recording to
distinguish between specific neurotoxic effects and general cytotoxicity.
Exposure to diesel and biodiesel exhaust-derived PM decreased neuronal activity dosedependent
without affecting cell viability. However, diesel exhaust-derived PM was evidently
more potent. Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC) UFP originating from high-aromatic (A20)
and low-aromatic (A0) diesel fuel decreased the neuronal activity, although higher doses also
exhibiting cytotoxicity. Interestingly, the non-volatile UFP fraction of A0 and A20 diesel fuel did
not affect neuronal activity and cytotoxicity, indicating that the SVOC exhibited considerably
higher neurotoxic potency than non-volatile UFP.
In the presented work, we demonstrated that diesel engine exhaust-derived UFP exhibit
neurotoxic hazard, but also that the potency is dependent on sample generation conditions.
Concluding, our data suggest that more emphasis should be placed on the emission of the SVOC
fraction, which represent a larger hazard for brain health compared to the non-volatile fraction."
Nutrient limitation increases CO2-dependent sensitivity of C-isotopic fractionation in Protoceratium reticulatum,"['Dugdale, Grace']","['Sluijs, Appy']",2022-05-20T00:00:38Z,EN,"['stable carbon isotope fractionation; nutrient limitation; carbon dioxide; pCO2, CO2 availability; paleo-environmental; proxy; carbon fractionation; dinoflagellate; protoceratium reticulatum']",Marine Sciences,"Stable carbon isotope fractionation (εp) of marine phytoplankton is influenced by aqueous carbon dioxide 
concentrations ([CO2(aq)]), cell morphology and metabolic pathways, which can further be influenced by 
environmental parameters, such as nutrient limitation. Increases in pCO2 levels, and duo-limitation of 
nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from strengthening of ocean stratification, are two of the predicted 
consequences of a changing climate due to anthropogenic fossil fuel consumption. In this study, we 
investigate Protoceratum reticulatum, an ecologically, economically and palaeo-environmentally significant
yessotoxin-producing dinoflagellate, under representations of past (180 µatm), modern (400 µatm) and 
projected (1000 µatm) pCO2 levels, in combination with limitation of essential nutrients N and P. Growth 
responses, internal stoichiometry, toxin production, and εpwere all analysed for singular effects of nutrient 
and pCO2, as well as the interaction between treatments. Toxin contents were independent of pCO2 under 
nutrient replete treatments, but showed a negative correlation with pCO2 under nutrient limitation. Highest 
toxin contents were found under nutrient limiting conditions at the lowest pCO2 . Growth rates(µ) remained
independent of nutrient limitation, and all growth response parameters (growth rate and population 
biovolume) were optimised around present day levels. PON and POP quota and production all decreased 
under nutrient limitation, and more so for the low CO2 treatments. All nutrient ratios increased significantly
with nutrient limitation, and caused deviations to the constant intracellular elemental stoichiometry that 
was otherwise maintained under nutrient replete treatments. POC quota and production, despite increasing
under nutrient limtitation, maintained a constant relationship with stable carbon isotope fractionation for 
both nutrient treatments. εp remained strongly CO2-dependent for both nutrient treatments,with significant 
increases in εp values observed under nutrient limitation. CO2-dependent sensitivity of εp also increased
under nutrient limitation, indicating potential changes in carbon species use and/or possible changes related 
to leakage. We found εp to be largely unaffected by µ, but largely influenced by POC content and pCO2, and 
indirectly influenced by nutrient limitation, which could suggest changes in CCM mode or decrease in CCM 
functioning under nutrient limiting conditions. The potential increase in carbon fixation under nutrient 
limited conditions at high levels of pCO2, in conjuction with increased intracellular carbon contents and 
changes in internal stoichiometry are likely to impact on oceanic carbon cycling of the biological pump, 
potentially altering the ocean’s capacity to buffer carbon. The strong CO2-dependency of 13C fractionation, 
even at low pCO2 levels, indicates a predominant diffusive uptake of CO2 by P. reticulatum under both 
nutrient replete and nutrient limiting conditions. This, along with the increased CO2-dependent sensitivity
of εp under nutrient limiting conditions, provides potential for use of P. reticulatum in the running for a
fossilized dinoflagellate CO2 proxy. However, additional experiments should test for strain-specific inorganic 
carbon uptake mechanisms, as well as directly testing possible offsets that might occur for 13C values 
between cells and cysts."
"Distribution tariff design considering
electric vehicle loads","['Oorschot, Sam van']","['Fumagalli, Elena']",2022-05-21T00:00:34Z,EN,['smart charging;'],Energy Science,"As part of reducing the emissions from personal transportation EV adoption is expected to rise
dramatically in the coming decade. Whilst this has a positive effect on climate targets issues the
current distribution networks for electricity were not built to accommodate the large rise in EV. This
problem can be tackled in a number of different ways, such as by expanding network capacity, or
including of storage at the distribution level. This thesis, however looks at price based incentives to
mitigate the adverse effects of EV charging on distribution grids. In particular a restructuring of
distribution grid tariffs was considered. Distribution grid tariffs are the tariffs paid by customers to
distribution system operators (DSOs) for use and maintenance of the grid. Currently most
customers connected to the low voltage distribution grid pay a flat rate for the grid tariffs. However,
by restructuring these grid tariffs incentives can be provided in order to make sure EVs use the
flexibility which exists in the charging sessions in order to limit congestion issues. In particular this
study will look at public charging, that is charging points (CPs) connected to the distribution network
and operated by a charging point operator (CPO).
Two particular proposals for grid tariff redesign were assessed. In the capacity subscription plus
model (CAP+) the customer chooses a subscribed capacity, that is a power up to which the customer
can freely use the grid. This subscribed capacity has options at a few different capacity sizes with
associated costs. When the customer exceeds the subscribed capacity an exceedance fee has to be
paid for each exceeded kilowatt-hour. The other considered option is a particular case of dynamic
grid tariffs where the CPO pays differing prices for power used at particular times. How much power
can be used at each time at the differing price levels is determined the day ahead. This tariff design
bundles all CPs connected to the same transformer, thus the total power is what matters rather than
the individual power of the CPs.
A perfect information model was constructed to find the optimal CPO behavior on a cost-wise basis
under the different tariff designs (current, dynamic and CAP+). It is evident from the results that if
the tariff design is left unchanged, and no alternative measures are taken to address the issue of
transformer overloading due to EV charging at public charging points, problems are likely to occur.
Introducing the CAP+ tariff design can mitigate part of this problem. But as the CAP+ tariff design
focusses on individual usage peaks rather than the collective network peak which causes this
transformer overloading it is not as effective at reducing transformer overloading as the Dynamic
tariffs can be.
For the implementation of a tariff design more factors need to be considered, however. The
regulatory authority (ACM) is responsible for accrediting a tariff design and considers factors such as
non-discrimination, simplicity, transparency and more. In this regard the dynamic tariffs are more
controversial as it requires technological capabilities and has a fairly complicated mechanic involving
predicted transformer loads. Whether the advantages of the dynamic tariff design in terms of
efficient network use, and thus overall costs reductions, outweigh the problems with current
legislation and these regulatory principles is, in the end, a decision to be made by the regulator and
is left outside the scope of this research."
Correlations between the different aspects of ketosis dynamics in dairy herds in the Benelux by using BHB-measurements in milk from the DeLaval Herd NavigatorTM.,"['Heitkamp, Wouter']","['Steeneveld, Wilma']",2022-05-21T00:00:30Z,EN,[],Gezondheidszorg landbouwhuisdieren en vet. volksgezondheid,"BHB-concentrations is mostly used for detection hyperketonaemia. Most studies applied BHB-concentrations in blood and a few studies have used BHB-measurements in milk. On-set, duration and maximum BHB-concentrations are different aspects of ketosis dynamics. The aim of this study is to investigate how different parameters of ketosis dynamics correlate with each other and the second objective of this study is to investigate if the severity of keto-sis can be reflected in an area under the curve of the repeated BHB-measurements in milk detected with the DeLaval Herd NavigatorTM. Within the Herd Navigator an inline sampler inside the AMS automatically takes a representative sample of 80 ml milk from each indi-vidual cow during the milking process and measures BHB-concentrations at least daily from 3 to 20 days in milk and between 21 and 60 days in milk at least once every 4 days. The in-vestigated data,  provided by Lattec, which included 48 herds working with the Herd Naviga-tor in the Benelux in June 2020. Data of unique calving’s between July 2018 and August 2019 were included. 
The final dataset included 130,247 BHB-measurements of 4030 unique calving’s. The cur-rent study defined three aspects of ketosis dynamics: the onset of ketosis, the duration of ke-tosis and the maximum BHB-concentration. Descriptive statistics were performed of the dif-ferent aspects of ketosis. Mean onset of ketosis was 18 DIM, 15 DIM and 12 DIM for cows with parity 1, 2 and 3+ respectively. Mean duration of ketosis was 21 days for cows with parity 1, 27 days parity 2 cows and 32 days for cows with parity 3+. The correlation between the onset of ketosis and the duration of ketosis was -0.546 (parity 2 cows), the correlation between the duration and maximum BHB-concentration was 0.460 (parity 2 cows). The area under the curve is calculated as a sum of all BHB-measurements between 3 and 60 DIM. The mean area under the curve was 3,67 for parity 1 cows, 4,14 for parity 2 cows and 4,63 for parity 3+ cows. The current study shows a strong correlation between the different aspects of ketosis dynamics. Therefore, the area under the curve, including all three aspects of ketosis dynamics, is an interesting possibility to reflect the severity of ketosis in dairy cows."
The impact of the first COVID-19 wave on the diagnostic trajectory of breast cancer in the Netherlands,"['Biesheuvel, Bodile']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-05-19T00:00:42Z,EN,[],Geneeskunde,"Introduction Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women. From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare was reorganized and diagnoses of breast cancer were decreased. The aim of this report is to assess the impact of the first COVID-19 wave on the diagnostic trajectory of symptomatic breast cancer patients in primary care in the Netherlands.
Method A retrospective cohort study was performed using Electronic Health Records to identify symptomatic patients with breast cancer. Those patients were internally validated. The primary outcomes were the patient and the primary care interval. Furthermore, the stratified and long durations were assessed, and the data was compared to DICKENS-1.
Results A total of 158 symptomatic breast cancer patients were identified. The IP was 18 days (IQR 4- 37) and the IPC was 1 day (IQR 1-2). Compared to DICKENS-1 the IPC was significantly longer (p-value 0.026). Less than four consults in the year before COVID-19 was associated with a shorter IP. A factor associated with a long duration of the IP was breast cancer related comorbidities. A non-physical first consults and no alarm symptoms were associated with a longer IPC and with a higher risk of having a long duration.
Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on prolonging the IPC of patients with breast cancer, but not on the IP. Future research should be focused on defining reasons for this prolongation and developing support for GPs to diagnose the patients at risk for a long duration."

Breakages in this epithelial barrier can lead to digestive problems and infection. Such barrier abnormalities accompanied with inflammation, often fatal, have been found in newborns and young children diagnosed with different diseases of the intestines and immune system. As a consequence, the gene TTC7A has been identified as a potential source for those abnormalities. The role of TTC7A in the maintenance of the epithelial barrier and in immune cells is not well-understood and therefore a cure does not exist. To address this gap in knowledge, we used small models of the gut, called organoids, taken from patients with TTC7A disease. Our organoids reflected the various epithelial defects observed in patients. We discovered novel interactions of TTC7A with other genes and their products responsible for cellular structure, and identified a drug that can help restore the function of the epithelial barrier. Our testing model can be used as a diagnostic tool to characterise epithelial abnormalities in patients and to test their responsiveness to a range of drugs."
Quantum-cutting Luminescence in CsPbCl3:Yb3+ Perovskite Nanocrystals,"['Zom, Jeffrey']","['Mangnus, M.A.']",2022-05-23T00:00:37Z,EN,"['Quantum-cutting, Luminescence Saturation, Perovskite Nanocrystals']",Nanomaterials Science,"CsPbCl3 perovskite nanocrystals doped with ytterbium have recently been discovered as highly efficient

While CsPbCl3:Yb3+ could increase the efficiency of photovoltaic devices, this saturation effect prevents effective application. Different mechanism for quantum-cutting and luminescence saturation have been proposed. As a result of this ambiguity, it is difficult to find a solution to prevent saturation. In this thesis, we further investigate a proposed mechanism behind quantum-cutting and luminescence saturation in Yb3+-doped perovskites. We measured a temperature dependence of the NIR-emission intensity in CsPbCl3:Yb3+ nanocrystals that is qualitatively in line with a mechanism without a proposed intermediate trap state in the quantum cutting mechanism. This is in contrast to the measured temperature dependent saturation, which qualitative is in line with a mechanism with an intermediate trap state. Time dependent measurements showed no overshoot in the luminescence intensity during the first few milliseconds after inset of excitation, which should be visible if quantum cutting occurs through the proposed quantum cutting mechanism that involves dopant pairs."
Microstructural changes related to dementia and music therapy in memory impaired patients measured with diffusion MRI: first insights of the ALMUTH trial,"['Gutiérrez Santamaría, Sofía']","['Leemans, Alexander']",2022-05-28T00:00:34Z,EN,['tractography; mean diffusivity (MD); fractional anisotropy (FA); network analysis; connectivity matrix; clustering coefficient; local and global efficiency; path length; memory impairment'],Medical Imaging,"Background: Dementia is a growing syndrome that requires many resources. Traditionally, its effects have been mitigated by pharmacological measures; however, new treatments such as music therapy are on the rise. In this study, underlying changes in brain microstructure associated to memory impairment and music therapy by means of diffusion are evaluated.

Methods: A cross-sectional and a longitudinal study were performed, in each of which a region of interest (ROI) analysis and a network analysis were carried out. 101 participants were selected for the short-term study (54 memory impaired participants and 47 healthy controls) and 31 for the long-term study (15 memory impaired participants in the music group and 16 memory impaired participants in the control group). All memory impaired subjects were recruited from the Alzheimer’s and Music Therapy (ALMUTH) study. They underwent diffusion-weighted (DW) and T1 scans in the same way as healthy controls. Diffusion and connectomics metrics were computed in 16 regions of the brain and in the whole-brain, respectively. These metrics were compared between groups and related to active musical engagement, musical training and number of active singing lessons.

Results: A significant increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right superior-temporal cortex, left medial-orbito-frontal cortex and right parahippocampal cortex regions was found when comparing pre and post scans in the ALMUTH music group. Also, FA and active musical engagement were found to be significatively correlated for healthy controls in three other regions: right insula cortex, left postcentral cortex and right postcentral cortex. Regarding mean diffusivity (MD), significant higher MD was encountered in ALMUTH participants than in healthy controls for the hippocampus and the parahippocampal regions. Likewise, a significant increase in MD in the entire hippocampus and in the left hippocampus was noticed when comparing pre and post scans in both the ALMUTH control and music groups, respectively. In relation to network metrics, significant higher local efficiency was obtained for healthy controls in comparison with ALMUTH participants.

Conclusion: The hippocampus and the parahippocampal regions are highly affected in dementia, but active musical engagement might prevent memory impairment in some regions. Also, the results suggest that a reduction in local efficiency can be a useful indicator for whole-brain memory decline. The findings regarding music therapy suggest it could have a positive effect on underlying microstructural changes, reversing the effects of memory loss in some regions."

play a crucial role in RNA metabolism. They facilitate local translation, which is especially important
in highly polarised cells such as neurons where long distances must be bridged. There are
several steps in local translation, including RNP granule assembly, transport and mRNA handling
and translation. In this review, we will discuss current research on RNP granule assembly and
how this can be regulated by post translational modifications. We will discuss mechanisms of
their active transport throughout the axon and dendrites by interacting with motor proteins or
hitchhiking onto membrane-bound organelles. Then, we will address recent findings on how RNP
granules allow for local protein synthesis and if disassembly is essential for mRNA translation.
Finally, we summarize the implications of RNP granule components in neurodegenerative diseases

The Think Like A Vertex approach in a parallel graph neural network,"['Klein, Katharina']","['Bisseling, Rob']",2022-05-24T00:00:38Z,EN,[],Mathematical Sciences,"Neural networks have been on the rise in the past years and are being applied in many different areas. Since in many applications the underlying data naturally has a graph-like structure, a type of network called graph neural network (GNN) has been proposed in 2009. This network type is able to capture dependencies within the graph by updating the state of each vertex based on the states of its neighbors, a process which has more recently been introduced as message passing. As graphs in practical applications are becoming considerably large, training and applying a GNN is computationally expensive and time-consuming and parallelization is therefore expected to be worthwhile. In the context of implementation, the Think Like A Vertex (TLAV) framework is a reasonable approach as it fits nicely with the BSP model for parallel programming. First introduced in 2010, the TLAV approach focuses on alternating local computations in a vertex and exchanging information with neighboring vertices.
In this project, we combine TLAV with the BSP model in order to design a parallel algorithm implementing the message passing process of a GNN. We test this parallelization with an update function based on the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Our experiments indicate that a reasonable speedup is obtained with respect to a sequential implementation, showing that the running time can be significantly reduced when applied to graphs of different sizes and with different properties."

To assess whether the analytical results differ based on the parameter settings, the difference between healthy controls and dementia patients will be analysed when changing the different parameters and measurements of the connectomic analysis.
The data employed during this research was obtained from the study performed by Reijmer et al., 2013, and consisted of a 3-T MRI scan and cognitive assessment of 59 dementia patients and 47 control subjects. DTI and CSD tractographies were obtained from every patient while changing the FA or FOD threshold, respectively, and the angle deviation. This data was then employed to perform two different network analysis approaches: based on the registration to the atlas or based on individual parcellation. Finally, the analysis were quantified by measuring the clustering coefficient, global and local efficiency, and distance from the binary connectivity matrices, and connectivity matrices weighted by the FA values and percentage of tracts.
The students t-tests (alpha 0.05) performed and the Cohen’s D values calculated showed that the measurement decreased while the FA threshold was increased, been anatomically implausible a threshold higher than 0.3. With respect to the angle deviation, the measures were increased together with the threshold, and the analysis showed that, for angles higher than 15º, a change of the angle deviation does not have a significant change in the results. Moreover, DTI tractography, network analysis based on individual parcellations, FA connectivity matrix and global efficiency have shown the higher discrimination performance when differentiating between healthy controls and dementia patients."
Identification of adverse drug reactions in Dutch electronic health records,"['Mourits, Gijs']","['Schraagen, Marijn']",2022-05-30T00:00:32Z,EN,"['Healthcare, Electronic Health Records, Adverse Drug Reactions, Natural Language Processing, Concept Extraction, Relation Extraction']",Artificial Intelligence,"Older people with polypharmacy and multimorbidity are at high risk for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) due to drug-drug interactions and age-related changes in pharmacodynamics/kinetics. A significant number of ADRs are due to represcription of withdrawn medication: recurrent ADRs. ADRs are poorly documented and are often lost in electronic health records (EHRs) in the form of unstructured texts.

Therefore we developed a method to detect potential ADRs in unstructured text of EHRs. For this we applied MedCAT, a concept extraction and linking tool, to the admission and discharge letters of 93 acutely admitted geriatric patients with polypharmacy. These letters were previously screened by clinicians for the presence of triggers and drugs frequently causing ADRs. We used MedCAT to extract text fragments containing adverse drug events (ADEs) frequently associated with ADRs and labelled these for whether the clinician denotes an ADR. Then, we used these texts to train two BERT-based models to recognize ADRs mentioned by clinicians in texts. These models were evaluated in terms of precision, recall and f1 score.

Our strategy to recognize ADEs frequently associated with ADRs achieves an f1 score of 71.4%, also detecting new ADEs that were missed during screening in previous research. The best model for recognizing ADRs mentioned by clinicians yields an f1 score of 76.9% and manages to outperform the baseline by 18.0%.

 We argue that our method performs well at identifying ADEs frequently associated with ADRs. Our strategy for identification of potential ADRs should however be further trained (on a larger dataset) and optimized before it can play a role in preventing recurrent ADRs in clinical practice."

A recent survey however shows that the TCN is rarely used for stock price prediction with exclusively financial data. In this study we will attempt to improve the TCN performance by looking at the effects of adding attention mechanisms to the TCN for forecasting stock prices. We also propose an architecture called the ATCN, a model that combines temporal and hierarchical attention in the TCN framework. Performance of the TCN is compared to models with hierarchical attention (HA-TCN), temporal attention (TCAN) or both (ATCN). We also evaluate the performance of the attention-based models when using a different number of layers. Results indicate that the TCAN performs best on average and that attention-based models need less filters and layers to perform well. We conclude that attention-based models are preferred over the standard TCN due to significantly faster training times and roughly similar performance, with TCAN the clear winner on this dataset. The ATCN shows some potential but needs to be tested further on more complex datasets."
The “Y” and how of stress eating: Neuropeptide Y on the crossover between feeding and stress,"['Swinkels, Tjerk']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-05-25T00:00:35Z,EN,[],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Chronic stress is detrimental to the health and increases the risk of obesity. Stress can
disrupt feeding behaviour, which is regulated by a complex neuronal and hormonal
network. The neuronal and endocrinal network of stress overlaps with the feeding
network at some points, leading to stress eating. One of these overlapping points is
neuropeptide Y (NPY), a potent orexigenic and anxiolytic agent.
In this review, the overlap between the role of NPY in homeostatic feeding and in the
stress response will be compared. Stress can elicit varied responses on both feeding
behaviour and NPY expression and signalling. Acute stress inhibits feeding, whereas
chronic stress tends to promote feeding. The stress eating network is responsible for
stress eating, usually through the direct or indirect modification of NPY/AgRP
neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and could be a potential target for
the treatment of stress-induced obesity."

Their contribution tends to introduce a low-frequency additive component to the acquired data, which ultimately leads to loss of contrast and erroneous SUV measurements in the reconstructed images. Despite Monte Carlo (MC)-based methods being considered the most accurate for scatter corrections, their computational demands prevent them from being clinically in use. In this work, the use of Deep Learning (DL) was investigated as a method to provide MC-grade scatter corrections within clinical timeframes.

Materials & Methods: MC simulations of two types of phantoms, 9 analytical and 24 voxelized-patients, were performed in GATE. With the resulting sinogram data of prompt coincidences and attenuation factors as input and the scattered coincidences as output, a 2D U-Net was trained. Independent network trainings were performed on 18 unique datasets. Each of them was constructed by using a different subset of simulated phantoms, a different input-output pre-processing, and a different 2D view over the same sinogram data. The performances of the trained networks were evaluated on a test dataset, which was consisted of 5 simulated phantoms excluded from the trainings, using Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) as a metric.

Results: The best-performing network achieved an NRMSE (mean ± standard deviation) of (4.94 ±1.88)  % overall, and (3.91 ±1.21)  % specifically for voxelized patient phantom cases. It was trained using the projection views of the sinogram data, with no input-output blurring. With input-output blurring applied, comparable results were obtained. Full scatter estimations of a single bed position were generated within 4.8 seconds. In 64% of the test cases, using the projection views of the sinogram data resulted in a lower mean NRMSE. The inclusion of analytical phantoms decreased the performance of the network on the voxelized-phantom tests by an NRMSE of 1% on average.

Conclusions: The feasibility of using DL for scatter estimation can be claimed. Improved accuracy is achieved by using the projection views instead of the sinogram views for trainings. Valid DL methods to generate a scatter estimation can be based on both unprocessed and blurred MC-generated training data. Which of the two constitutes the optimal strategy remains inconclusive, as their quantitative accuracy must be evaluated on the final reconstructed images."

were enriched in multiple Hpa infected cultures. In this study, we looked at the influence a few
selected Hpa-associated bacteria have on Hpa sporulation as well as how Hpa influences the
growth of these single bacterial isolates. We did this in an axenic system using gnotobiotic Hpa
(gnoHpa). Our results validated that the previously identified Hpa-associated bacteria also
benefited from the presence of Hpa in a gnotobiotic growth system. Next to that, we observed
that two Hpa-associated bacterial isolates from the genera Microbacterium sp. and
Aeromicrobium sp. significantly reduced gnoHpa sporulation. The reduction in sporulation seen
by Microbacterium sp. is likely by directly antagonizing Downy mildew. Together our results
opened an interesting pathway where further research can be conducted to understand the
fundamental interactions occurring in the phyllosphere of plants infected with Hpa.
Understanding these interactions is of key importance to uncover novel mechanisms to deal with
pathogen attacks through stimulation of the leaf microbiota."
Detection and Quantification of Natural Gas Leaks using Mobile Measurements in Amsterdam,"['Maynou Rivas, Paula']","['Velders, Guus']",2022-10-26T00:00:42Z,EN,['Methane; methane emissions; emissions quantification; mobile measurements; gas distribution network; global warming; gas leaks; leak detection'],Science and Business Management,"Fast mobile detection of gas leaks in urban natural gas networks results in speeding up leak detection and repair procedures, thus reducing methane (CH4) emissions and safety in urban areas. In this study, we carried out mobile measurements in the city of Amsterdam using high-precision methane analyzers installed in a van. As a result, 44 potential gas leaks were identified, i.e., leak indications (LIs), out of which 31 were quantified. Similar to other studies, a few large leaks in Amsterdam were contributing to a large proportion of the estimated total emissions. Two of the quantified LIs contributed to 76% of total emissions and these two leaks were fixed by the local gas distributor after locations were shared with the utility. The detection probability of significant CH4 enhancement (more than 10% above background) on single passages was, on average, about 70% for the smaller leaks and increased to 100% with bigger estimated size. Overall, 73 % of the confirmed leaks were already detected on the first pass by the measuring van. Our results indicate that mobile CH4 surveys can be a useful method that could be implemented in the management of natural gas (NG) distribution systems for faster detection of leak locations compared to common methods, and for leak quantification and repair prioritization in order to mitigate CH4 emissions. Further mobile measurements and improvements in the data analysis process of this method in collaboration with local gas distributors will improve detection and emission quantification of gas leaks in the natural gas network."
Keyed Alike: Towards Versatile Domain-Specific Keyword Extraction with BERT,"['Pozzi, Lorenzo']","['Sosnovsky, Sergey']",2022-10-26T00:00:44Z,EN,['keyword extraction:deep learning:dataset generation:'],Human-Computer Interaction,"Automatic Keyword Extraction involves the identification of representative terms in a passage of interest. There are various applications, including topic modeling, semantic search, information retrieval, and text summarization where a set of key- words is highly effective. Past research showed the potential of Transformer models for the task. However, such architectures are limited by the need for labeled datasets that require time and effort to be annotated. The present research seeks to overcome this limitation by proposing an alternative annotation approach for Automatic Key- word Extraction corpora, generalizable to diverse domains with reduced costs and production time. Then, a model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) will be fine-tuned to extract domain-specific terms from the generated dataset. The experiments aim to corroborate the designed annota- tion procedure and shed light on BERT’s capability in recognizing relevant terms for domain-specific documents. This thesis also proposes an analysis of the word space generated by BERT in order to study the effect of fine-tuning on Automatic Keyword Extraction. The results showed that the proposed solution for dataset an- notation was effective and that the implemented BERT-based model outperformed the baselines in all the proposed tasks. Moreover, the final analysis indicates that BERT’s word space follows a semantic coherence since the generated embeddings are arranged based on the relatedness to the target domain."
Triple Oxygen Isotope Composition of CO2: Analytical System Improvements and Seasonal Variability,"['Ye, Yujie']","['Roeckmann, T.']",2022-10-26T00:00:48Z,EN,[],Climate Physics,"The triple oxygen isotope composition (∆′17O) of troposphere CO2 is considered as a potential tracer for quantifying gross primary production (GPP) at an ecosystem scale. In this project, air samples from two different ecosystems, Loobos (evergreen coniferous forest ecosystem) and Cabauw (grassland ecosystem) were taken from December 2020 to April 2022 in order to quantify the seasonal variation in ∆′17O values of tropospheric CO2 with the focus of quantifying gross primary production at an ecosystem scale. The ∆′17O was measured using a CO2-O2 isotope exchange technique coupled with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). We characterized and investigated the stability of CO2-O2 the isotope exchange system using different CO2 standards. The results showed that larger thermal diffusion (larger temperature gradients in the CO2-O2 isotope exchange reactor) will lead to smaller fractionation both for reactor temperature of 750 °C and 1000 °C. Tropospheric CO2 sampled in Cabauw has an average ∆′17O value of 0.221 ± 0.006‰(SE) from December 2020 to April 2022. The temporal evaluation of ∆′17O values does not show a clear seasonal cycle with slight upward trend toward summer but more scattered in the winter, with an amplitude of approximately 0.08‰. The seasonal variation of ∆′17O value of tropospheric CO2 and its upward trend toward summer indicate the activity of terrestrial vegetation and may be used as a potential tracer of GPP."

This dualism is a part of a greater dualistic worldview which assigns negative value to some categories while attributing positive value to their “opposites.” Instead of accepting that the sciences and humanities are indeed inherently and incommensurably different, this thesis posits that the opposition of the “objective” sciences and the “subjective” humanities is actually incomplete and therefore not a realistic or useful construct. Instead, I present the use of storytelling as a valuable method for knowledge-making in science.
Making use of “queer defamiliarisation” as discussed by Helen Palmer, in the first part of this thesis I compare scientific practice to Ancient Greek mythology to identify and recognize the already existing but unacknowledged narrative elements in science. In the second part, using theory from queer, feminist, and Indigenous work on knowledge, method and translation, I argue that the explicit use of narrative storytelling in scientific practice can lead to greater accountability, knowledge, and accessibility in the sciences.
By allowing for the acknowledgment and further incorporation of storytelling into the sciences, this thesis shows how the concept of knowledge can be queered to be less dependent on strict boundaries between disciplines, thereby making space for creative development of new ideas and perspectives both within and beyond scientific practice."

In 2018 is het actieprogramma Kansrijke Start opgezet. Dit actieprogramma richt zich op het ondersteunen van ouders en kinderen in een kwetsbare situatie vóór, tijdens en na de zwangerschap tot en met de eerste twee levensjaren van het kind (de eerste 1000 dagen van het kind). De gemeente Asten heeft hiervoor de Lokale Coalitie Kansrijke Start Asten (LCKSA) opgezet. Vanuit de gemeente is de behoefte uitgesproken om te onderzoeken wat er binnen het huidige zorgnetwerk goed werkt, wat er versterkt kan worden en hoe dit versterkt kan worden. Hiervoor zijn semigestructureerde interviews afgenomen met 9 professionals. De data van de interviews is op basis van een thematische analyse geanalyseerd. Vanuit de literatuur (deductief) en de interviews (inductief) zijn de volgende thema’s naar voren gekomen: samenwerking tussen professionals, (vroeg)signaleren van risico- en beschermende factoren, de signalerings- en zorgkaart, het Sociaal Team, laagdrempeligheid van professionals en communicatie met ouders. Voor deze thema’s is geanalyseerd wat werkt, wat versterkt kan worden en hoe dit versterkt zou kunnen worden. De kernpunten om hiervan mee te nemen zijn: 1. Afstemmen van verwachtingen tussen professionals. 2. Herhaling van kennis en expertise omtrent risico- en beschermende factoren. 3. De signalerings- en zorgkaart meer zichtbaar maken. 4. Één aanspreekpunt voor professionals. 5. De hulpvraag van de professional als leidend nemen. 6. Extra laagdrempelige ondersteuning bieden vanuit de JGZ. 7. Communicatie met laaggeletterden versterken. Wanneer hier op wordt ingezet kan de ondersteuning van ouders in een kwetsbare positie binnen de eerste 1000 dagen van het kind verder worden versterkt."

Regional knowledge networks towards innovation in the field of renewable energy,"['Gonzalez Mateo, Álvaro']","['Wanzenböck, Iris']",2022-11-01T01:02:00Z,EN,['innovation; networks; renewable energy; patents; regions'],Innovation Sciences,"Climate change is one of the greatest threats that humanity is facing today. Minimizing its effects can only be achieved through a future of renewable energies (REs). Therefore, innovation in this sector plays a key role in achieving environmental objectives to curb this threatening scenario before it is too late. Previous studies have shown the great impact the characteristics of knowledge networks have on the innovative performance of regions in general and in certain technologies in particular. These networks are defined as a variety of actors, which are interconnected by collaborative relationships that enable or constrain the diffusion, transfer and 
acquisition of knowledge and information, and thus influence innovative output. Interestingly, this approach has hardly been investigated in the energy sector despite the emphasis on collaboration being key towards successful energy innovations. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is to answer the question of how the characteristics of a region´s RE sector knowledge network influence regional innovation in this sector. 

To this end, several hypotheses are proposed relating different characteristics of regional knowledge networks to the RE innovative performance of 270 European NUTS 2 regions between 2003 and 2017. These include characteristics referring to both intra-regional and interregional collaborations and are classified in three main types: structural (overall connectedness and cohesive subgroups), proximity (geographic and technological proximity) and actor-specific (intermediaries and gatekeepers). For the construction of the variables, RE patents were used. 

Hypothesis testing has been done using regression analysis on three main models. One considering all patents in removable energy (baseline model), and two energy-specific for solar energy (solar model) and wind energy (wind model). 

The results reveal that an overall a loosely coupled regional network structure impulse innovation in RE, although, it is important that there are cohesive subgroups of inventors within it. It is also key that the region receives external knowledge from beyond its closest neighbours and that this is to some extent similar to the region's RE technology base. Finally, it is desirable to have actors in charge of disseminating internal and external knowledge throughout the groups of actors of the regional network.

This thesis offers a new point of view through the analysis of knowledge networks to the study of regional innovation in RE, which we consider useful both for future studies in this field and for policy makers seeking to improve the regional performance of their regions in RE."

This research utilises insights from contentious politics, dramaturgy and social psychology on social movement to analyse anti-black Pete protest participation. Through an examination of the drivers and performance of black Pete opposition, it provides insight into the perceptions of the individuals that instigated a heated societal debate which resulted in significant changes to the celebration of St. Nicholas. It draws on qualitative data derived from interviews with 25 respondents to construct a holistic conceptualisation of individuals' protest experiences.

Living System Perspective on Ecosystem Services,"['Vegt, Michelle van der']","['Appelman, Jaco']",2022-11-01T01:02:19Z,EN,['Ecosystem services; Living systems; Exergy; Organisational exergy; Dissipative structures; Autopoiesis; Ecological services.'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"Within the last decade, the Earth has become recognized as a coupled social- ecological system, where human activities significantly impact the functioning of the earth system, its ecosystems, and vice versa. Currently, the ecosystem services framework still shows a mechanistic perspective of ""nature for people"". Based on limited social-ecological integration, this view gives the illusion that humans can exploit and control nature to their benefit via a one-way utilitarian relationship whilst perceiving humanity to be outside the system. Therefore, it is time for a paradigm change within the ecosystem services framework by thinking about social-ecological relationships and dynamics rather than treating planetary and ecosystem processes as separate biophysical systems occasionally perturbed by human activity. This thesis attempts to build a bridge between the social and ecological realms by placing the ecosystem services concept into a living system perspective. Showing through exergy how ecosystems can be viewed as living sys- tems whilst adding a foundational layer to the ecosystem services concept. We intend to increase the knowledge of decision-makers within policy and practice on the basic functioning of ecosystems by explaining how ecosystems have evolved to sustain themselves over time. Where we hope that this foundational layer can be used in the future as guidelines when working with the ecosystem service concept."
Using the AudioMoth - a novel passive acoustic monitoring technology - to monitor bat diversity in a rewilded landscape,"['Pronk, Koen']","['Cromsigt, Joris']",2022-11-01T01:01:57Z,EN,['AudioMoth; Rewilding; Chiroptera; Ecoacoustics; Wildlife monitoring; shifting mosaics'],Sustainable Development,"Ecosystem restoration through the reintroduction of grazers is gaining interest across Europe. Large herbivores are associated with landscape heterogeneity, restoration of trophic cascades and biodiversity. Projects implementing this form of trophic rewilding benefit from adequate monitoring techniques to assess the progress of ecosystem restoration. Bats have been put forward as suitable bioindicators, providing generalizable insight into responses of a multitude of taxonomic orders further down the food chain.  At the same time, novel acoustic methods such as the AudioMoth allow for upscaling studies concerning the behavior of sound producing animals, which may be used to monitor progress of rewilding projects. In this study, I explored the relative detection probabilities of the AudioMoth in cluttered, edge and open habitat types, where clutter refers to areas with more trees and understory vegetation. Clutter reduced detection probability with the AudioMoth with sounds played over a speaker at 10kHz and at three ascending volumes. The AudioMoths were also used to assess the impact of three habitat types (forest, forest edge and open grassland) on the presence of functionally different bat genera, by placing the devices in each habitat to record bats for 3-4 days over the course of three months. The forest-adapted genus Plecotus was not more likely to be detected in any of the habitats. I did find evidence that the edge-adapted genus Myotis was more likely to be detected in open compared to forest habitat, and open-adapted genera Nyctalus and Seronitus were more likely to be detected in forest edges and open grasslands compared to forest habitats. Lastly, I compared bat genus richness between a rewilded area and its non-rewilded nature surroundings in Dutch national landscape ‘Het Groene Woud’. There was no effect of rewilding on genus richness. Further efforts to monitor rewilding projects should consider the methods used in this study, as AudioMoth provides a low-cost and energy-efficient option, and bats an indication of wider taxonomic patterns. My data and findings may be used as a baseline study for bat and rewilding research in the local context of Het Groene Woud."

Use of dredged sediments as a sustainable material,"['Smit, Pieter']","['Wosten, Han']",2022-11-01T01:02:17Z,EN,['Dredged sediments'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"Sediment is dredged from the bottom of rivers and harbours to keep inland shipping and marine traffic possible. All over the world hundreds of millions of cubic meters of sediment is dredged annually. Human activity surrounding those rivers and harbours are a source of pollutants that are ingrained in the sediment. A huge part of the dredged sediment is classified as waste and is dumped in sea or on land. There are however many valuable resources present in sediments that now go to waste. Dredged sediments consist predominantly of eroded rock and soil in the form of sand, silt and clay. Those are non-renewable resources used in applications ranging from building materials to plant growing media. Organic matter and heavy metals present in dredged sediments can be used for beneficial purposes. This review paper aims to address why dredged sediment is not completely used as a resource and whether these barriers can be overcome. There are several reasons why not all dredged sediment is used. These include the inconsistent composition of the dredged sediment, the common occurrence of pollutants in sediment and the high cost associated with using dredged sediment compared to other sources. Construction materials are held to high standards, as buildings and roads should be safe. The variable nature of dredged sediment causes construction materials made from them to have different attributes. High costs also are a barrier in the use of dredged sediments. Steps needed to prepare dredged sediments for use results in higher prices compared to similar resources. These barriers lead to a low demand for dredged sediments. Cost would go down with increased use of dredged sediments, as processes will become more efficient and new methods of cleaning will be tried. Regulations from the government could help streamline this process, by standardising test for sediment compositions and lifting the ‘waste’ classification of dredged sediments."

Melanoma-derived extracellular vesicles: Signaling through their miRNA content,"['Jennekens, Jitte']","['Schiffelers, Raymond']",2022-11-09T00:00:53Z,EN,[],Regenerative Medicine and Technology,"Melanoma is the deadliest type of skin cancer. Early diagnosis is of great importance for patient outcome. Currently, genetic testing is required to determine the mutational background. Promising research on extracellular vesicles (EVs) could offer a potential new method to diagnose melanoma. Melanoma cells are known to secrete these EVs as an oncogenic signaling mechanism. One of the components packaged in EVs are miRNAs. It was hypothesized that melanoma mutants BRAF, NRAS, and double mutant distinctively regulate the miRNA composition in secreted EVs. Identifying this mutant-specific miRNA profile in the blood of patients could be used to diagnose melanoma and the mutation. To test whether EV-enriched miRNAs are melanoma-mutant dependent, and whether these signature miRNAs also alter gene expression in recipient cells, we compare the miRNA profiles of EVs and their cellular counterparts for different melanoma mutant cell lines (BRAF, NRAS, double mutant). Target prediction and in vitro target validation is performed to elucidate the regulatory role of these candidate signature miRNAs. We show that EV miRNA profiles are distinct from their matched cellular profiles. The signature miRNA identified for BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines, hsa-mir-6728-3p, enhances TGF-beta signaling via ITCH and Smad2/3 phosphorylation. TGF-beta signaling is known to promote tumorigenesis, drug resistance, and immune surveillance in melanoma. In addition to target validation, we aimed to shed light on miRNA sorting mechanisms in EVs. The existing hypothesis of selective miRNA sorting is based on the specific recognition of motifs within the miRNA sequence by sorting proteins. In our miRNA dataset, such sorting motifs could be identified in the EV-enriched miRNAs and cell-retained miRNAs. Although sorting motifs are highly cell line dependent, some of the identified motifs were shared between the melanoma cell lines and also between previously identified motifs by others, suggesting a conserved nature. Interestingly, these motifs are located primarily at the 3’ end of the miRNA sequences. Altogether, we identified a signature miRNA for BRAF and double mutant melanoma cell lines. For the BRAF signature miRNA we were able to show its capability to regulate the TGF-beta pathway, underlying the importance of EV-miRNAs in tumorigenesis. Sorting of miRNAs into EVs is an extremely complex mechanism that is highly cell line dependent. Our data suggest, in line with previous literature, the existence of sorting motifs within the miRNA sequences."

SAAP-148 showed to have high efficacy not only against multidrug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens but also against biofilms and persister cells. Yet, the exact binding mechanism of SAAP-148 is unknown. In this study, we use ssNMR and binding studies to show that the affinity of SAAP-148 is aspecific and it binds to all anionic lipids. Additionally, we use carboxyfluoreiscein leakage assays to study the effect of SAAP-148 on the permeabilization of the lipid vesicles. This data unexpectedly shows that the permeabilization of SAAP-148 is not coherent with the affinity of the negative charge of the lipids. SAAP-148 permeabilizes not only DOPG but DOPC membranes as well. On the other hand, SAAP-148 has only small a perturbation effect on the anionic lipid, cardiolipin. This information can be used to improve the antimicrobial properties of SAAP-148 and in the design of better antibiotics.  
Chapter 2: Gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics as compared to Gram-positive bacteria. One of the reasons for this is the difference is in their cell envelop structure. The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria contains a phospholipid inner leaflet and an almost entirely lipopolysaccharide (LPS) outer leaflet. LPS shields the bacteria from harsh environments and incorporation of LPS is essential for bacterial survival. LPS is incorporated into the membrane by the LPS-transport chain, facilitated by seven proteins (LptABCDEFG). The most accessible part of these proteins is the LptD/E complex. This complex is embedded in the outer membrane of the envelope and performs the final step of the transportation by incorporating the LPS in the outer membrane. An antibiotic, called Murepavadin, binds to this LptD/E complex in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) and inhibits the incorporation of LPS in the OM. In this study, we give insight into the transformation, expression, and purification of the Pa LptD/E complex that could be used in further studies to investigate the binding of Murepavadin to this complex using solid-state NMR."
The Effect of Job Involvement on the Relation between Age Discrimination at Work and Job Satisfaction of Young Female and Male Employees,"['Breit, Paulina']","['Armenta Gutierrez, Bibiana Maria']",2022-11-09T00:00:48Z,EN,['age discrimination at work; job satisfaction; job involvement; gender'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Age discrimination is one of the most common forms of discrimination in the workplace and negatively impacts essential aspects of employees' work life, such as job satisfaction. It is mainly associated with older employees, although young employees are experiencing more age discrimination (Marchiondo et al., 2016). Therefore, the current study will focus on young employees. One aspect of work that can buffer against this negative effect on job satisfaction is job involvement. It is an important factor to increase job satisfaction and therefore, has a strong positive influence on it. Previous research found that women were more discriminated against because of their age in the workplace compared to men (Stypinska & Turek, 2017). Surprisingly, women had higher job satisfaction and involvement than men (Bender et al., 2005; Reid et al., 2008). Therefore, this study hypothesizes that age discrimination at work is negatively associated with low job satisfaction. This association will be moderated by job involvement. Further, this moderation will be moderated by gender, to determine gender differences in young employees for the impact of job involvement on the relation between age discrimination at work and job satisfaction. The sample consisted of 308 respondents, 192 female and 116 male employees between 18 and 30. The outcomes revealed that the first hypothesis was supported, while the second and third were not supported. The implications of this study are that organizations should offer educational workshops about age discrimination and create a positive work climate. The study showed that age discrimination also affects young employees, and not just older employees."

Data was drawn from N=181 adolescents from two schools on the Caribbean island of St. Maarten participating in a 2-wave longitudinal study. The first set of questions compared girls in age-discordant romantic relationships to those in same-age relationships or no relationships in regard to age at menarche, risk behaviors, levels of depression and parental monitoring. At wave 1, those in age-discordant relationships reported significantly higher delinquency than girls in no relationship and reported significantly higher substance use than girls with same-age relationships or no relationship. At wave 2, girls in age-discordant relationships reported significantly less parental monitoring when compared to girls with no relationship. A second set of analyses focused on examining how differences in dating status of adolescent girls associated with levels of delinquency, substance use, depression and parental monitoring over time. It was found that girls who were in relationships reported higher substance use over time when compared to girls not in relationships. Together these results add to the literature regarding adolescent dating behaviors and risk-taking, and they emphasize the importance of parental monitoring when designing prevention and intervention aimed at minimizing the risk of long-term implications such as teenage pregnancy and HIV."
Psychometric properties of the fifth version of the Posttraumatic-Stress-Checklist in a clinical sample of refugees,"['Hofmann, Samuel']","['Djelantik, Manik']",2022-11-09T00:00:46Z,EN,[],Clinical Psychology,"Background
The validity and reliability of the fifth version of the Posttraumatic Stress Checklist (PCL-5) have been demonstrated in numerous studies in Western cultures, various languages, and increasingly in non-Western cultures. However, its applicability in a heterogeneous sample of refugees is controversial because the PCL-5 is based on the Western understanding of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study aimed to measure the psychometric properties of the PCL-5 in a sample of refugees and to assess the suitability of this questionnaire for screening refugees living in a Western country for PTSD.
Method
An existing data set of 1202 refugees was analysed utilising Cronbach’s alpha, inter-item and inter-subscale correlations, convergent and discriminant validity, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. For validity assessment, the PCL-5 was compared to the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (CAPS-5), and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI).
Results
Clusters generally measured the underlying constructs of PTSD well, however, the expected pattern between subscales was not confirmed, and a ceiling effect was observed. ROC analysis yielded a cut-off score of 44 and inconsistencies were found concerning convergent and discriminant validities. The PCL-5 does not appear to discriminately capture the severity of trauma experienced by refugees. It might be that the previously assumed cut-off score is too low for our treatment-seeking sample as the PCL-5 does not adequately capture the sequential, prolonged, and ongoing traumatisation of refugees. This should be considered when developing and deciding on a screening instrument to be used for refugees.

Notably, psychiatric patients may be at a general greater risk to be touch deprived because of social isolation. Several transdiagnostic symptoms may be related to touch deprivation, namely self- esteem, emotion dysregulation, and intolerance of uncertainty. This study investigated if touch deprivation was predictive of these transdiagnostic symptoms in psychiatric patients and if there was a difference in touch deprivation between patients and controls. The expectation was that a higher amount of touch deprivation would be predictive of a lower self-esteem, a higher intolerance of uncertainty, and a higher amount of emotion dysregulation in both psychiatric patients and controls. Furthermore, the relationship between touch deprivation and transdiagnostic symptoms was expected to be stronger in psychiatric patients compared to controls. The results indicated that, even though group membership was predictive of transdiagnostic symptoms, touch deprivation was not. It follows no interaction was found between group membership and touch deprivation on transdiagnostic symptoms. Furthermore, no difference was found in touch deprivation between patients and controls. Possible explanations for the absence of the expected results include the small sample size and the questionnaires used. So, continued research on touch deprivation in psychiatric patients is vital to increase our knowledge of the role of touch in relation to psychiatric symptoms, which may hold a place in future treatments."

fluvial networks from elevation data in an objective way.
It was found that sea-level rise enhances sediment mobility which, in combination with
flood dominance, leads to higher sediment fluxes to the upstream part of the experiment
than in experiments without sea-level rise. Sea-level rise also allows tidal currents to propagate
further upstream which promotes channel formation upstream in the experiment.
Most importantly, sea-level rise causes the morphological units in estuaries to shift landward
and the upstream part of the system to silt up, given enough sediment is available to
fill the created accommodation. In the case of low sediment availability, which is common
in systems in which dams and dikes are built, coastal squeeze may prevent transgression
and estuarine environment will drown. Two examples, the Scheldt and the Wadden sea,
are considered to illustrate what the fate of estuaries could be, considering the current
and predicted sea-level rise. It is found that if sea-level rise stays on the low end of the
predictions (40 cm/100 yrs), the Scheldt and the Wadden sea area may aggrade to maintain
a stable position. In case sea-level rises faster, these systems are likely to transgress
but are prone to coastal squeeze because of man-made hard boundaries directly landward
of them. It is therefore expected that many of these systems will drown in the centuries
to come, unless we change our coastal management strategy and create more space for
systems to silt-up and keep up with sea-level. The findings of this study can contribute
to managing estuaries sustainably in terms of sediment budgets, navigability and ecology."
"IMPACT OF TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL ON TEMPORAL PERCEPTION AND EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOR IN A MOUSE
MODEL OF BIPOLAR MANIA","['Pham, Phuong']","['Groenink, L.']",2022-10-28T00:01:02Z,EN,['Bipolar disorder; mania; dopamine transporter; tetrahydrocannabinol; cannabis; behavioral pattern monitor; temporal discrimination task; mouse-model; temporal perception'],Farmacie,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder affecting about 1% of the world’s population. However, there is still a lack of adequate treatment for BD. Mania state, the defining feature of BD, manifests insomnia, aggression, and motor hyperactivity, possibly due to dysregulation of the dopaminergic system. In BD lower dopamine transporter (DAT) expression and function are observed which leads to decreased dopamine metabolism which may cause elevated dopamine transmission during mania state.
Cannabis is used in higher rates in people with BD than in the general population. THC, a psychoactive compound present in cannabis, decreases dopamine levels over time, and therefore, with the elevated dopamine levels observed in bipolar mania, may be able to treat the mania-like symptoms of BD.
DAT knockdown (KD) mice reconstruct BD-related behaviors such as hyperexploratory and risky decision- making behavior in the behavioral pattern monitor (BPM) and may be useful to develop newer treatment strategies for BD mania. We investigated if hyperexploratory behavior of DAT KD mice would decrease after chronically administering THC (14 days) in the behavioral pattern monitor (BPM). 45 mice (51% DAT KD, 22% female) were intraperitoneal injected of either THC (3mg/kg) or saline for 14 consecutive days and then tested in the BPM.
Another cohort of DAT KD mice in the BPM, other cohort DAT KD mice were tested in the temporal discrimination task (TDT). The TDT measures temporal perception which altered in BD and by THC. Therefore, we used the TDT to investigate the effect of THC on temporal perception of these subjects. The data we provide is data from during the training phase. 45 mice (54% DAT KD, 56% female) were trained in the TDT task, with each session duration being 30 minutes.
The 19 sessions were insufficient for all mice to attain criterion in the TDT (> 85% correct), although current training revealed no sex or genotype differences in training to-date. Chronic THC treatment attenuated exploratory behavior in DAT KD mouse model of bipolar mania, with a trend effect (p = 0.055) in rearing, and a similar effect in holepoking.
Chronic THC treatment on DAT KD genotype might attenuate exploratory behavior in DAT KD model of bipolar mania. Moreover, when mice perform the TDT task consistently investigation on the effect of chronic THC treatment on temporal perception will be performed."
"Metamorphic conditions of the Cap de Creus shear zones (NE Spain) - Insights from an integrated petrological, electron microscopy and numerical approach","['Melick, Hans van']","['Drury, Martyn']",2022-11-01T01:00:57Z,EN,['Cap de Creus; Greenschist; Shear Zones; Automated Mineralogy; SEM-AM; EDS; Perple_X; TitaniQ;'],Earth Structure and Dynamics,"Recent advances in the field of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) allow the simultaneous, gridwise, collection of energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) and the capture of back-scattered electrons (BSE). Phase maps of sample surfaces are created by comparing pre- (or post) defined phase classifications to relative elemental abundances obtained by automated deconvolution of the EDS signal. The construction of phase maps using this method is named ’SEM-EDS automated mineralogy’, or SEM-AM. In this work an SEM-AM-based workflow is evaluated in a case study on pegmatites and high-grade metasediments that have been strongly deformed into shear zones under greenschist facies conditions. While the structural features of these Cap de Creus area (NE Spain) greenschist facies shear zones have been studied in detail, only few PT constraints are available. Bulk rock chemistry (BRC) of the samples is calculated by applying a Python-based script to SEM-AM derived data integrated with phase classifications constrained by EDS-SEM and wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS) microprobe spot measurements. This calculated BRC is compared to BRC obtained using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) on the corresponding samples, and subsequently used as input for numerical modeling with Perple_X. The resulting equilibrium mineral assemblages are compared to the mineral assemblages observed in the samples in order to constrain deformation conditions. To obtain additional constraints on deformation temperatures, quartz microstructures are analyzed and the Ti-in-Quartz geothermometer is applied to selected quartz grains. Trace element chemistry is studied to quantify the effect of fluid influx. This thesis demonstrates how the aforementioned SEM-AM workflow can deliver high-quality whole-rock chemistry results that are consistent with traditional methods, providing that mineral chemistry can be adequately constrained. The SEM-AM false color phase maps are a great asset because they visualize the relation between mineral associations, structural features and mineral reactions. Integration of the SEM-AM results with a numerical approach provides new PT estimates for the greenschist shear zones, ranging from 400-430 °C at 2.5 kbar to 410-450 °C at 3.5 kbar. Uncertainties in Ti-activity result in a large T uncertainty of results obtained using the Ti-in-Quartz geothermometer, but results suggest pressure may be as low as 2 kbar, associated with temperatures between 390-420 °C. For an undeformed sample PT conditions are estimated at 650±30 °C at pressures of >3.9 kbar, which is in accordance with earlier estimates. From trace element chemistry a mass increase of ±54% is computed as a result of element transport by Si- and presumably Ca-rich fluids, and thermodynamic modeling highlights the effects Fe speciation has on mineral stabilities. The here presented PT results, quartz microstructures, and observed Al2SiO5 polymorph behavior, indicate deformation under progressively decreasing metamorphic conditions consistent with the retrograde stages of the Variscan orogeny."
Female Entrepreneurship in Uganda: Manoeuvring gendered spaces,"['Iannaccone, Dana']","['Noorloos, Femke van']",2022-10-31T01:00:54Z,EN,['Female entrepreneurship; Gender; Empowerment; Uganda; Motherhood'],International Development Studies,"Sub-Saharan Africa is a region currently facing the problem of sufficient job creation due to the young population steadily entering the labour market. A key role can be played by women, who seize economic opportunities and contribute to essential job creation through their entrepre-neurial activities. Sub-Saharan African countries, and Uganda in particular, have the highest entrepreneurship rates in the world. In fact, more women than men engage in entrepreneurship. Nevertheless, women in Uganda also spend twice as much time on unpaid care work, putting them in a disempowered position vis-à-vis men. As a result, promoting female entrepreneurship has become a key policy focus of national governments and international development organi-sations. It is intended to support the equal participation of women in productive employment and correspondingly foster their empowerment process. Therefore, this thesis explores the em-powering effects of female entrepreneurship and the contributions of national governments and cooperation agencies.

The thesis is based on a policy analysis consisting of the strategies of the Ugandan government as well as the measures of the Women Entrepreneurship for Africa (WE4A) programme of the German development agency GIZ to analyse contextual obstacles in the empowerment process. The study offers an outlook on policy implications and measures for possible application in future programs. Beyond that, it uncovers sociocultural norms that influence the empowerment process through an in-depth qualitative analysis of ten interviews with female entrepreneurs and selected experts. The study offers insight into the empowerment process triggered by wom-en's entrepreneurship by reporting on individual experiences and social practices regarding the gendered division of unpaid care and household tasks. In doing so, areas of women's agentic independence and their contribution to the collective empowerment process are explored. The study highlighted the multidimensionality of the empowerment process and addressed women's views and interpretations of empowerment through entrepreneurship. The findings revealed both empowering effects for women entrepreneurs and remaining challenges due to discrimi-natory structures and entrenched power dynamics."
Link between mental health and self-reported number of digital hairs suggests new way to measure expressed testosterone,"['Geerse, Roos']","['Terburg, David']",2022-11-01T01:01:12Z,EN,['digital hair; testosterone; arousal; emotionality; mental health; reiteration'],Applied Cognitive Psychology,"There is growing consensus that testosterone is related to mental and physical health, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. One explanation for the conflicting results found in the study of testosterone is that this hormone is needed for the arousal that signals the expectation of a positive outcome, meaning that high testosterone can be expected to lead to impulsive behavior and thus enhance a person’s risk to develop an anxiety disorder, whereas low testosterone would lead for instance to apathy and thus enhance a person’s risk to develop a mood disorder. To investigate this hypothesis I explored the relation between emotionality, mental health and the self-reported number of digital hairs as an indicator of expressed testosterone in an online survey in which 316 Dutch (speaking) men and women participated. Using factor analysis on a pool of items probing the participant’s tendency to react emotionally I identified four types of emotionality: an internalized negative type, a positive type, a sexual type and an externalized negative type. I found that mental health was indeed higher at intermediate levels of digital hair, and that there was a positive association between general emotionality and digital hair, though only in partnered persons and women. These results should be interpreted with caution because data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic and with the exception of partnered men all participants had relatively low scores on the used measure for mental health. Nevertheless, the fact that by using the digital hair measure a distinct pattern was found suggests that this measure may be employed as an easy to use and non-invasive marker for expressed testosterone, although the measure is probably more reliable if the assessment is done by a trained assessor, especially in men as they have more digital hair then women. To further elucidate the association between testosterone and reward related arousal I introduce the concept of reiteration as the phenomenon that links perception, representation and behavior."

strong optical properties. These optical properties can be further enhanced and manipulated by altering
size, shape and structure of the titania. In this project, monodisperse amorphous titania colloids with a
polydispersity of 6% and an average diameter of 438 nm were successfully synthesized through a sol-gel
method. In this form the colloids displayed iridescent colours, after self-assembly (SA) into colloidal
crystals. After silica coating of these titania colloids, stable titania-silica composites were formed with a
polydispersity of only 3% and an average diameter of 421 nm, still exhibiting iridescence after SA. These
composites were used to successfully form onion shaped and icosahedral photonic supraparticles with
diameters ranging between 3 and 30 µm through evaporation induced self-assembly. Especially the
icosahedral supraparticles showed bright and patterned colouring upon illumination. The titania-silica
composites were also functionalised with octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMOS) and dispersed in nonpolar
solvents. These colloids had a polydispersity of 4% and an average diameter of 506 nm, they did not show
iridescence and formed only partially crystalline supraparticles with diameters ranging between 4 and 20
µm.

The strong display of colours in our synthesized photonic supraparticles shows great promise for future
applications in nanophotonics, photocatalyis and structural colouring. However, many parameters used
in the experiments are not yet optimized, such as the speed of SA, or fully understood, decreasing
reproducibility of the experiments and control over the self-assembly of the supraparicles. Future research
should focus on these parameters so that consistent photonic supraparticles can be synthesized."
Deep Learning-Based Contrast Transformation of High Resolution 3D Gradient Echo Images Trained Using Low Resolution 2D Turbo Spin Echo Images,"['Pollitt, Ryan']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-11-01T01:01:19Z,EN,"['Convolutional neural networks, deep learning, image synthesis, Magnetic Resonance Imaging']",Medical Imaging,"Acquiring multiple clinically relevant MR image contrasts from a single scan is an emerging trend in MR imaging to reduce the total scan time of an exam. A deep learning-based approach that takes this idea one step further is BoneMRI, which generates synthetic CT images from MR images. These images are generated using a 3D RF-spoiled T1‐weighted multiple Gradient-Echo sequence (GE), but the sequence is often combined with a 2D T1-weighted Turbo Spin Echo (TSE), because the latter provides better T1 contrast from a clinical perspective. To
reduce the total scan time, we investigate a deep learningbased approach to generate synthetic TSE images from the GE images. We propose a training approach, called the High-to-low approach, to keep the high through-plane resolution of the GE images, while still applying the contrast transformation using only the lower resolution TSE as target data. Additionally, we implement a network architecture, called HighResNet, and redesign it for the synthesis of TSE images from GE images. The proposed approach and network do not necessarily need to be used together and both were validated against a more often used approach and network, respectively. Experiments using scans of the cervical spine showed that the High-to-low approach was capable of keeping the higher through-plane resolution of the GE images, while also achieving significantly higher image similarity to the lower resolution ground-truth TSE after downsampling. The experiments also demonstrated that HighResNet synthesized high resolution synthetic TSE images with fewer artifacts than the often used U-Net. The results show that a neural network is capable of learning an MR contrast transformation between a higher resolution input image and lower resolution output image without sacrificing performance or image resolution."

Dit onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat de vraag naar CPO het grootst is onder 25 tot 34 jarigen en in de meest stedelijke gebieden. Dit terwijl uit de literatuur gebleken is dat het aandeel CPO juist afneemt naarmate de stedelijkheid toeneemt. Belangrijke afwegingen die een rol spelen bij het tot stand komen van CPO hebben te maken met een gebrek aan capaciteit bij gemeentes en de kleinschaligheid van CPO projecten. Een belemmering met betrekking tot het tot stand komen van CPO is de geringe aandacht die het in veel gemeentes krijgt in het coalitieakkoord. Kansen om meer CPO mogelijk te maken hebben vooral te maken met beleid gericht op burgerparticipatie en samenwerking tussen zowel gemeentes onderling als met CPO begeleidingsbureaus."

Current methods to generate counterfactual explanations do not take the structural characteristics of multivariate discrete sequences into account. In this work we propose a framework that uses evolutionary methods to generate counterfactuals, while incorporating criteria that ensure their viability. Our results show that it is possible to generate counterfactuals that are viable and automatically align with the factual. The generated counterfactuals outperform baseline methods in viability and yield comparable results compared to other methods in the literature.”"

Distillation-Crystallization for Lithium Extraction","['Bonk, John']","['Kramer, Gert Jan']",2022-11-09T00:00:38Z,EN,['ex-ante LCA; ex-ante life cycle assessment; life cycle assessment; LCA; lithium mining; lithium extraction; membrane distillation; membrane distillation-crystallization; salar de atacama chile'],Sustainable Development,"Lithium is an energy-critical-element (ECE) that is a fundamental component of lithium-ion batteries which
are projected to surge in demand in the coming years to meet the rising demand for battery electric 
vehicles (BEVs), variable renewable energy storage systems(RESS) and personal electronics. Supplying the 
projected amount of lithium for lithium-ion batteries in the near future is challenging due to the 
geographical concentration of lithium reserves and resources, complexity of recovering lithium from 
brines and the environmental impacts associated with lithium extraction in general. Several emerging 
technologies are being investigated to determine if they can provide additional lithium production 
capacity with improved efficiency and applicability to varying brine chemical compositions.
In this study, membrane distillation-crystallization (MCr) is investigated as a potentially environmentally 
preferable alternative to the current lithium extraction process from continental brines. An ex-ante life 
cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to measure the potential environmental impacts of using MCr as 
an alternative to the brine inspissation process. The midpoint impact assessment methodologies used 
were global warming potential (GWP), water use, acidification potential (AP), resource use (metals and 
minerals) and cumulative energy demand (CED). To conduct the study, an early-stage lab study of MCr by 
(Cerda et al., 2021) for lithium recovery was scaled using processing modeling at the Advanced Mining 
Technology Center in Chile to create a life cycle inventory (LCI) of MCr in addition to an annual operational 
mass and energy balance. The MCr LCI was coupled with existing datasets for Li2CO3 production to model 
a theoretical MCr-Li2CO3 production facility and measure the environmental impacts associated with 
producing the functional unit (FU) of 1 ton Li2CO3. 
Additionally, a narrative literature review was conducted to determine the current environmental impacts 
associated with brine inspissation in the Salar de Atacama, Chile. A second narrative literature review was 
conducted to determine the criteria upon which an improved lithium extraction technique can be 
measured. Lastly, the land use, land use intensity (LUI) and production intensity of the current brine 
inspissation route and the MCr route were explored.
The most salient results of this study indicate that an MCr lithium extraction facility has the potential to 
produce the equivalent of 100 kilotons Li2CO3, 76 kilotons of potassium chloride (KCl) and 14 megatons of 
freshwater per year with an annual raw brine input of 22 megatons per year. This results in a 64% water 
recovery efficiency and 75% lithium recovery efficiency. However, the main drawbacks are the exceptional 
amount of energy required which amounts to 5.43 TWh per year and would require approximately 50 km2
of land if powered by solar photovoltaic (PV) energy. The other main drawback found was that the MCrLi2CO3 production route had 4.5 times the amount of GWP than the brine inspissation route and 2.5 times 
the GWP when using 100% solar PV for electricity supply. Lastly, considering MCr uses 94% less water 
than the brine inspissation route, it is a trade-off worth further evaluation and future research."
Ferry-ADCP observations of tidal currents in the Marsdiep inlet and how they are affected by the motion of the ferry,"['Karaoli, Athina']","['Maas, Leo']",2022-11-08T00:01:08Z,EN,[],Climate Physics,"The Wadden Sea is a dynamic tidal system with multiple inlets. In the western Dutch Wadden Sea large amounts of fresh water coming from Lake IJssel are being exchanged with saline water coming from the North Sea during a tidal cycle. This study analyzes the tidal currents in the Marsdiep inlet which is located between the mainland of the Netherlands and the island of Texel. The velocity measurements are obtained via two Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) mounted underneath the hull near the bow and the stern of the Texels Eigen Stoomboot Onderneming (TESO) ferry. The use of two ADCPs allows to investigate not only the spatial and the temporal variability of the velocity field of the flow but also the turbulence during tidal cycles. Features of tidally induced turbulence are identified by using the difference of the measurements of the horizontal velocities of the two ADCPs which were found to differ slightly. In this study, the vertical profile of the turbulence as well as its relation with the strength and the phase of the tide are investigated. Regarding the vertical velocity of the flow, it is observed that the ADCP at the bow of the ferry always measures a downwelling motion while the ADCP at the stern of the ferry measures an upwelling motion of the flow. This observation leads to the speculation that the ferry’s motion influences the velocity measurements and the measured velocities are not the real ones. A correction of the vertical velocity component for the ferry’s motion is introduced in this study and through this correction a physical interpretation of the vertical velocity is given by identifying physical features in the inlet. Finally, we expect that the component of the velocity along the sailing direction is also affected by the ferry’s motion. As the ferry sails, there is a displacement of a large amount of water backwards underneath the hull due to a pressure gradient created by water level differences. However, instead of a backflow, a forward flow is observed in the direction of the ferry’s motion and possible origins for its presence are given in this study."

streets, the process of dancing changes urban space into a playground and challenges rigid 
movement patterns. This thesis starts with the analysis of visual perception pattern and rigid 
movement pattern in urban space in chapter 1. It explains the features of movement pattern of 
pedestrians, like limited space, fast speed, and linear routine, are addressed by the ideology of 
efficiency and consumption. In chapter 2, the theoretical framework is constructed through 
notions of performativity, dérive, and urban choreography across theoretical bodies from 
cultural study and performance theory. I position drifting as a way of challenging the 
dominance of visuality and speed within the movement pattern in a societal context of 
consumption through the lens of urban choreography. In doing so, I also indicate the political 
potential of drifting and dancing on streets, examining its capacity to question everyday 
habitual modes of moving in the urban space. In chapter 3, I uncover the choreographic logic 
within Stadterweitern by Sabine Zahn, examining political meaning of the reinvented playful 
urban space to question functional and efficient movement pattern. By analysing 
choreographic tactics in Stadterweitern as an example of alternative movement pattern, I 
assert that structured urban space can be changed as a playground with dynamic rhythm and 
critical awareness through everyday artistic bodily practice in a neoliberal context."

This study investigates the transition to plant-based protein consumption, the “Protein Transition”, which is expected to decrease greenhouse gas emissions through reduction of animal-based protein production and consumption. In the context of any transition, issues of social injustice need reflection and consideration. This research focuses on injustices induced by this plant-based Protein Transition in the Netherlands and investigates to what extent the different parts of the population are included and enabled to move away from animal-based proteins and make the necessary dietary changes. This study combines for the first time the Just Transition framework with the seven Technological Innovation Systems functions and is used as a proclaimed framework to analyse the presence of potential injustices in the Dutch Protein Transition. The results from extensive interviews with seventeen stakeholders, ranging from producers and marketers to consumers and policy makers, are analysed in a qualitative case study. The findings indicate that the Dutch Protein Transition induces geographic and ethnic inequalities. The engagement and involvement of rural areas and ethnic cultures present in the Netherlands are currently insufficient, and local knowledge of these consumer groups is lacking, which results in non-inclusive communication and marketing strategies. Additionally, the lower and middle socio-economic consumer groups are less participatory because of the high product prices resulting from the novelty of the transition, as well as from an immature development state of the products and the lack of transparency in government policies. To make the Protein Transition ‘just’, consumer focus should significantly shift towards rural areas and ethnic consumer groups, and become inclusive to all parts of Dutch society."

As such, it is essential to have findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) research software. However, what precisely the landscape of research software looks like is unknown. Thus, we would like to understand the research software landscape better and utilize this information to infer actionable recommendations for the Research Software Engineer (RSE) practice. This study provides insights into the research software landscape at Utrecht University through an exploratory analysis while also considering the different scientific domains. We achieve this by collecting GitHub data and analyzing repository FAIRness and characteristics through heatmaps, histograms, statistical tables, and tests. Our method retrieved 176 users with 1521 repositories, of which 823 are considered research software. Others can adopt the proposed method to gain insights into their specific organization, as it is designed to be reproducible and reusable. The analysis showed significant differences between faculty characteristics and how to support the application of FAIR variables. Among other things, our results showed that Geosciences have the highest percentage of unlicensed repositories with 57%. Also, Social Sciences are an outlier in language usage, as they are the only faculty to primarily use R, while other faculties primarily use Python. A first classification model is developed that achieves 70% accuracy in identifying research software that can be used for future labelling tasks. Our recommendations include expanding the R café, creating FAIR reference documents, featuring and highlighting high impact and FAIR research software, and creating yearly reports. We conclude that our labelled GitHub dataset allows us to infer actionable recommendations on RSE practice."
Taking Root: A Grounded Approach to Science Communication for SEALINK Curaçao,"['Houtman, Tabita']","['Hegger, Dries']",2022-11-09T00:00:42Z,EN,[],Sustainable Development,"Communicating research findings to a lay public comes with a range of challenges, as 
can be seen in the considerable literature on Science Communication (SC). Part of the issue is 
a lack of an empirically-based understanding of the communication context, such as audience 
characteristics or situational barriers. There is literature available on the necessary 
considerations for SC, but this is fragmented, with different authors mentioning different 
components and strategies. What is needed is a concrete grounded, empirically based approach 
to SC. This is the theoretical gap this research aims to fill, with a main research question of: 
What good practices can be identified for a grounded approach to science communication?
First, a conceptual approach is composed based on components identified in existing literature.
To illustrate the usefulness of such an approach, and to provide a methodological example, a 
case study is utilised. The case chosen here is the SEALINK project. SEALINK is an 
interdisciplinary research project studying the ways in which various inputs affect the growth 
and survival of reefs in the Dutch Caribbean. This case was chosen due to the lack of prior 
research on this topic both within the project and within the region. The novelty necessitated an 
in-depth empirical analysis, providing a comprehensive methodological example. Discussion 
of findings and theoretical implications lead to theoretical learning, ultimately answering the 
main research question. Methodologically, key findings include the value of interviewing 
individuals from multiple actor categories, and the value of conducting street interviews and 
some form of participant observation. Both allow for an enrichment of findings. Theoretically, 
it was found that the composed grounded approach seemed to provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the communication context. However, the sub-component ‘opportunities’ in 
the main component ‘situational factors’ requires further development, both theoretically and 
methodologically."

The central dogma is the process which decodes this information through two mechanisms: transcription and translation. These mechanisms are important in the correct transfer of information, which decides cell fate, pattern location and development of an organism. In vitro studies have already shown mechanistic insights of the central dogma, however there is still a big gap in our understanding about how the central dogma effects the development of an organism. These gaps can only be filled by studying the central dogma in real time and in vivo. In this review we describe three new techniques which are used to study mechanisms of the central dogma in vivo. The first technique is the MS2-tagging system, which allows the visualization of transcription in vivo. Visualization of transcription is the first step of understanding gene regulation. Difference in transcription levels between cells is essential for the pattern formation in embryos. The second technique is the SunTag. This system is developed to visualize single proteins in cells, whereas In vivo the SunTag is able to visualize translation. This system revealed that the location of translation is related to the function of the protein. Finally, we discuss the LlamaTag. The LlamaTag is a technique which allows the visualization of proteins with a short lifetime. These proteins are important during development and small changes in their activation leads to dysfunction in the development of an organism. The LlamaTag allows to study the dynamics of these proteins in vivo. These techniques aid to understand the central dogma which dictates the cell fate and animal body plan."

Research supports the availability of social support, individual adaptive coping styles and effective implicit emotion regulation as resilience factors against PTSD development. Risk factors include specific features of an event, pre-existing attributes and lack of post-traumatic social support. Furthermore, social cognitive impairments are common and debilitating manifestations in PTSD patients, leading to reduced social support. The acceptance of social support is known to be of great importance for the processing of the traumatic experience. Thus, exploring the association between PTSD and different social cognitive domains seems to be worthwhile. The current literature review mainly considers cognitive empathy processes, including theory of mind (ToM), emotion recognition and social perception, but attributional styles are also discussed. Although its limitations, insights in the neural correlates of social cognitive processes may be a valuable, non-invasive manner in trying to understand dysregulated emotional processing in PTSD patients. Considering brain regions, the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex appear to play an important role in the pathophysiology of PTSD. No consensus yet is reached whether amygdala activity is heightened in PTSD or not, which might be attributed to comorbidity problems and heterogeneity of study designs. However, decreased hippocampal volume is repeatedly shown. FMRI studies also show reduced hippocampal activation. Lastly, studies often show less activation or even deactivation in ventral medial PFC regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex. However, other studies have undermined this. A mutual consensus whether vmPFC activity is decreased in PTSD is therefore not yet agreed on. In conclusion, social cognition plays an important role in PTSD. Systematic assessment of social cognition in clinical practice is of the essence, in order to enhance treatment decision-making and outcomes, to ultimately provide the best care for the patient."
Utilizing the gene expression prediction algorithm Enformer to enhance classification of noncoding variants,"['Wit, Nimrod de']","['Ridder, Jeroen']",2022-11-22T01:00:45Z,EN,"['niet-coderende varianten, deep learning, Enformer, random forest, data compression']",Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"In de meeste ziektes speelt genetica een rol. Daarom is onderzoek naar het effect van genetische variatie belang-rijk. Ons genoom bestaat uit een coderend en een niet-coderend deel. In deze studie passen we zelflerende algo-ritmes toe om het effect van genetische variatie in het niet-coderende deel van het genoom te bepalen. Het En-former algoritme is een state-of-the-art algoritme wat in staat is voor elke willekeurige streng DNA te voorspellen hoe de genexpressie zal zijn. Deze voorspellingen gebruiken we om een ander zelflerend algoritme te trainen zodat het in staat is onderscheid te maken tussen genetische variatie die wel en die geen invloed heeft op genexpressie (een algoritme wat onderscheid probeert te maken tussen twee of meerdere groepen noemen we een classificeer-der). Hiervoor gebruiken we een dataset met varianten waarvan het bekend is dat deze een effect hebben op gen-expressie (positieve eQTLs) en varianten waarvan bekend is dat deze geen effect hebben op genexpressie (negatie-ve eQTLs). Voor elke variant in deze dataset verkrijgen we de voorspellingen van het Enfomer algoritme. 
        Aangezien deze voorspellingen een te grote omvang hebben om direct gebruikt te worden voor het trainen van de classificeerder, moeten de voorspellingen gecomprimeerd worden. Dit is eerder gedaan door Avsec et al. (ref.19), maar wij hebben deze methode verbeterd. Wanneer de classificeerder getraind wordt op onze scores pres-teert het beter dan wanneer het getraind wordt op de scores van Avsec et al.. Hun methode van scoren, Sum, zorgt voor een gemiddelde classificeerder prestatie (AUROC) van 0,748, terwijl onze methodes Max Abs, Q99 Abs en Sum Abs respectievelijk zorgen voor een gemiddelde prestatie van 0,762, 0,776 en 0,777.
        Naast deze vernieuwde methodes om de voorspellingen te comprimeren, hebben we ook geprobeerd de voor-spellingen op een geheel andere wijze te comprimeren, namelijk met behulp van een zogenaamde automatische encoder. Dit is een algoritme dat leert om een grote hoeveelheid waardes samen te vatten. Het is ons niet gelukt om dit algoritme werkend te krijgen en we doen voorstellen hoe dit onderzoek vervolgd kan worden. 
        Concluderend kan worden gesteld dat het gebruiken van het Enformer algoritme om meer inzicht te krijgen in niet coderende varianten een veel belovende weg is en in dit onderzoek presenteren we nieuwe methodes om dit te doen."
Additional information that the community pharmacists need when assessing antithrombotic prescriptions,"['Kotwal, Maryam']","['Bouvy, M.L.']",2022-11-22T01:00:48Z,EN,[],Farmacie,"Inleiding: antitrombotica zijn bedoeld om het risico op trombose te verminderen, maar verhogen in het algemeen het risico op bloedingen vanwege een verlengde stollingstijd. Apothekers komen vaak verschillende problemen tegen bij het beoordelen van antitrombotica recepten in de openbare apotheek. In dit onderzoek willen we weten welke aanvullende informatie een openbare apotheker in Nederland nodig heeft om antitrombotica recepten te beoordelen, waarom deze informatie wordt opgevraagd en of de aanvullende informatie leidt tot een interventie van de behandeling.
Methode: dit onderzoek is een semi-kwalitatief, observationeel onderzoek die is uitgevoerd in 5 openbare apotheken in Nederland. Antitrombotica voorschriften waarvoor de apotheker bij de uitgifte of controle extra informatie nodig had zijn geïncludeerd in de studie. Apothekers werd gevraagd om op een opgesteld verzamelformulier op te schrijven welke extra informatie nodig was, bij wie deze informatie opgevraagd werd, welke afwegingen de apotheker maakte bij het beoordelen van de recepten en hoe het recept afgehandeld is.
Resultaten: De aanvullende informatie die werd opgevraagd werd als volgt geclassificeerd: nierfunctie, contra-indicatie, indicatie, duur van de behandeling, dosis en anders. Aanvullende informatie over de nierfunctie werd opgevraagd voor de klasse direct orale anticoagulantia (DOAC). Apothekers vroegen aanvullende informatie op over de contra-indicatie ‘verhoogde kans op gastro-intestinale bloeding’ op voor patiënten die voornamelijk salicylaten voorgeschreven kregen. Voor de DOAC's, duale therapie en heparines is aanvullende informatie gevraagd over de indicatie. Voor patiënten die duale therapie kregen voorgeschreven, werd meer informatie gevraagd over de duur van de therapie. Er was meer informatie nodig over een interactie voor de vitamine K antagonist (VKA) acenocoumarol.
Conclusie: Aanvullende informatie over de nierfunctie wordt het meest gevraagd voor DOAC's. De leeftijd van de patiënt en het feit dat de medicatiedosering afhankelijk is van de nierfunctie van de patiënt zijn factoren waarmee apothekers rekening houden. Voor het voorschrijven van acetylsalicylzuur, inclusief carbasalaatcalcium, wordt vaak om informatie gevraagd om te beoordelen of een patiënt een verhoogd risico heeft op het ontwikkelen van een gastro- intestinale bloeding of een contra-indicatie heeft voor de plaatjesaggregatieremmer. Extra informatie over de indicatie van een DOAC werd noodzakelijk geacht in het geval een patiënt geen comedicatie gebruikte, bijvoorbeeld cardiovasculaire medicijnen. Informatie ter beoordeling van de voorgeschreven behandelingsduur werd vooral gevraagd bij het voorschrijven van combinatietherapie. Vaak werd om aanvullende informatie over dosering gevraagd, bij een geneesmiddel waarvan de doseringen per indicatie verschillen en afhankelijk zijn van de nierfunctiecomedicatie gebruikte, bijvoorbeeld cardiovasculaire medicijnen. Informatie ter beoordeling van de voorgeschreven behandelingsduur werd vooral opgevraagd bij het voorschrijven van combinatietherapie."
Securing their Future: How Sport for Development Programmes Empower Kenyan Adolescent Mothers Regarding their Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights,"['Bakker, Leonie']","['Sözeri, Semiha', 'Macklin, Kitty', 'Baar, Paul']",2022-11-22T13:21:13Z,en,[],Master Youth Education and Society,"Adolescent pregnancy is a global health problem. This study examines an important determinant of adolescent pregnancy: lack of knowledge about sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). Initiatives have been taken to prevent such pregnancies by empowering adolescent girls regarding SRHR. Such preventive initiatives include Sport for Development programmes (SfD). However, the question arises of whether preventive approaches bypass the empowerment needs of adolescent mothers. This study takes a mixed methods approach to explore how SfD programmes empower adolescent mothers regarding their SRHR and applies an empowerment theory that incorporates the role of agency and opportunity structure. This study comprises a case study of Secure Futures (SF), an SfD programme targeting adolescent mothers in the Nairobi slums. Paired t-tests were used to analyse survey data from 155 participants aged 19-30 years (M = 24.1), who gave birth in adolescence. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders (n = 10) involved in the implementation of the programme. Paired t-tests revealed a relationship between programme participation and enhanced SRHR empowerment and knowledge. The interview findings show that SF empowers adolescent mothers regarding their SRHR by addressing both agency, through the provision of knowledge and psychosocial support, and opportunity structure, through community involvement and economic empowerment. Additionally, the findings reveal that agency and opportunity structure are interrelated in respect of their impacts on empowerment. This study also identified a relationship between economic empowerment and opportunity structure which may advance the empowerment theory. Further research may explore this relationship in more depth."
Disease location as a predictor for clinical outcomes in Paediatric Crohn’s Disease.,"['Kraaier, Iris']","['Bovenschen, Niels']",2022-11-22T01:00:51Z,EN,"[""Paediatric Crohn's Disease; Prognostics; Paris Classification;""]",Geneeskunde,"Background & aims Disease location is a known predictor of adverse outcomes in paediatric Crohn’s Disease, but
data on clinical medium- and long-term outcomes are lacking. This study aims to evaluate disease location as a
predictor of biochemical remission, disease severity, medication use, growth and adverse outcomes in paediatric
Crohn’s.
Methods 396 participants with paediatric Crohn’s Disease were included and prospectively reviewed at set time
points. Clinical data was calculated into disease activity scores and combined with laboratory results to compose
the primary outcome.
Results 24.5% of participants had isolated ileal disease, 17.4% had isolated colonic disease and 58.1% had
ileocolonic disease at baseline. Isolated ileal disease was associated with longer median time to diagnosis (209 ±
260 days) and more complicated disease at baseline. Ileocolonic disease was associated with higher prevalence of
upper gastrointestinal disease, higher inflammation markers and lower albumin. Isolated ileal disease was
associated with less achievement of biochemical remission within one year follow up, but not with sustained
biochemical remission at one year follow up. Multivariate analysis showed no association between disease location
(HR 0.45; 95%CI 0.20-1.01; p=0.053) and time to biochemical remission or time to biological treatment (HR 1.37;
95%CI 0.98-1.90; p=0.062).
Conclusion In paediatric Crohn’s Disease, ileal involvement is associated with less biochemical remission within
one year and unfavourable disease characteristics at baseline. Further research is needed to establish the
relationship between disease location and prolonged biochemical remission."

Protein structures are an important part of this, as these structures are often highly correlated with protein function. Mass spectrometry can be employed to aid in the elucidation of these protein structures. This review will take a look in recent studies using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) in the context of structural virology. HDX-MS is a technique that can measure the amount of deuterium uptake in viral  roteins under different conditions. Deuteration rates are heavily dependent on the environment of the residue, as reduction of solvent exposure and involvement in hydrogen bonding are key factors in the reduction of deuteration. This review will
give examples of studies in which HDX-MS helped with the discovery of binding sites, protein conformations and allosteric effects of binding. Among others, HDX-MS helped in better understanding Influenza hemagglutinin activation, mapping of antibody epitopes on several viruses and better understanding allosteric effects in viral proteins. It will also give an overview of the general HDX-MS workflow and provide strengths and weaknesses of HDX-MS."
Heat stress in Swifter sheep in the Netherlands: panting score and salivary cortisol as a measuring tool for predicting heat stress and the effect of a shadow creating trailer,"['Hoogevest, Annabel van']","['Rodenburg, Bas']",2022-10-29T00:00:37Z,EN,['heat stress; panting score; salivary cortisol; heat stress in sheep; shadow creating trailer; scrum formation;'],Gezondheidszorg landbouwhuisdieren en vet. volksgezondheid,"Heat stress in sheep has become more important over the years due to rising global temperatures. The Dutch Food Safety Authority (NVWA) has therefore recently enforced a new directive stating that any flock in the Netherlands where at least 10% of the sheep is exhibiting a panting score of 2 or higher is in serious offence, provided that no protection measures have been taken. However, this directive is based on data of research of which the set-up is not comparable with the Netherlands. This research project therefore focused on determining the suitability of panting score and salivary cortisol as measuring tools to predict heat stress in Dutch circumstances. Furthermore, it was studied whether access to a shadow creating trailer (SCT) affected these predictions. This was done by measuring the rectal temperature, temperature-humidity index (THI) and panting score of 40 Swifter sheep twice a day, five days a week at 11:00 and 16:00 for the duration of three weeks. Salivary cortisol samples were taken once a day at 16:00 two days a week. In addition, two cameras were installed to observe their behaviour daily during the entire three weeks. Using a generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace Approximation) and Akaike's information criterion (AIC) for model reduction showed salivary cortisol should not be included in the model and could therefore not be used to predict heat stress. Panting score, THI and access to the SCT were included in the model and can therefore be used to predict heat stress in Dutch circumstances. The odds of sheep experiencing heat stress with no access to the SCT were 3.3 times greater than the odds of sheep with access to the SCT. The activity of the sheep in the sun group seemed to be higher than the sheep in the shade group, regardless of THI. Scrum formation, the aggregation of sheep in a tight group, was generally only seen in the sun group during a clear blue sky, thin layer of clouds or when the sun broke through the clouds. 
In conclusion, this study did not prove that salivary cortisol can be used to predict heat stress in Dutch circumstances. However, panting score, THI and access to an SCT are suitable to predict heat stress and should preferably all be taken into account as the model included all three parameters simultaneously. The SCT was effective in preventing heat stress in sheep. Scrum formation occurred regularly and was mostly seen in the sun group. It is therefore adaptive behaviour to having no access to shade, possibly even adaptive behaviour to (strong) radiation from the sun. Sheep with no access to the SCT were likely to exhibit higher activity than sheep with no access the SCT. Future studies should focus on how possible differences in activity affect the weight of sheep with and sheep without access to shade."
"The relationship between employment status and job burnout in women: a contradiction 
between effort-reward imbalance and work-family imbalance.","['Padt, Jasmijn']","['Besamusca, Janna']",2022-10-29T00:00:59Z,EN,['Job Burnout; Effort-reward imbalance; work-family imbalance'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Background. Job burnout is a huge mental health problem, often perceived as genderneutral. However, this gender-neutral view is inconsistent, meaning that the causes of job 
burnout are probably different for women. Inconsistent evidence exists regarding the 
relationship between employment status and job burnout in women. According to the rolestrain theory, part-time work alleviates job burnout in women, because work-family 
imbalance decreases when time and energy are allocated in a manageable way. However, 
mixed results are found in this relationship. Moreover, the effort-reward model postulates that 
a discrepancy between efforts and rewards at work induces job burnout in women. This might 
mean that not only employment status induces job burnout in women. The following research 
question is formulated: What is the role of effort-reward imbalance and work-family 
imbalance in explaining the relationship between employment status and job burnout in 
women?
Methods. This study had a quantitative research approach and used data from the 
European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS-2015). After deleting participants due to 
exclusion criteria, a sample size of 3590 women remained living in the Netherlands, 
Germany, Belgium, Austria and the United Kingdom. 
Results. The results of this study showed first of all that full-time work was associated 
with job burnout in women. Second, effort-reward imbalance was associated with job burnout 
in women. Third, work-family imbalance was associated with job burnout in women. Fourth, 
work-family imbalance mediated the relation between full-time work and job burnout in 
women. 
Conclusion. This research has contributed to the inconsistent results of employment 
status on job burnout in women. This study showed that in line with the role-strain theory, 
women who work full-time experienced more job burnout as compared to women working 
part-time, especially due to the experience of a work-family imbalance. Policies should
therefore focus on decreasing job burnout in women who work full-time."
The causation of disappearing traffic in the context of the Netherlands,"['Dijk, Rick van']","['Ettema, Dick']",2022-10-29T00:01:17Z,EN,['Disappearing traffic; Modal choice; Travel behavior'],Human Geography,"Taking away infrastructure for the car is often predicted to cause problems in neighboring streets as the traffic diverts. Cairns, Atkins, and Goodwin (2001) beg to differ as they state that, depending on local circumstances, overall traffic levels significantly drop as people have a wider range of behavioral responses than predicted. This is also known as disappearing traffic. To this day there is little research done regarding disappearing traffic.

This research aims to provide insights into the effects of discouraging measures towards the car on the travel
behavior of car drivers. The following main research question is used;
Under what circumstances are car drivers changing their travel behavior and how do they cause traffic to
disappear?

This research is executed through the use of a literature research and an online stated preference survey. The survey was filled in by a total of 414 respondents. 

Multiple factors influence whether respondents change their travel behavior. First, it depends on the travel motive. Results show that people are more bound to the car for the travel motive ‘’Social and Recreative’’ in comparison to the travel motives ‘’Work & Study’’ and ‘’Household & Services’’. The average distance for this travel motive is also longer compared to the other travel motives, so the effect on travel behavior of extra travel time is less. On top of that is this a less common trip, making people less likely to deviate from their current travel behavior.

Other results show that extra travel time towards the car has a bigger impact on whether people choose their travel behavior in comparison to extra travel time in the car. More people state that they would change their travel behavior when their travel time would be increased by 5 minutes compared to an extra five minutes on the road. Therefore is it more alluring to focus on increasing the travel time towards the car instead of taking measures that increase the travel time in the car. 

Having an alternative is an important factor in whether people change their travel behavior or not. This is obvious, but it does highlight the importance of having good facilities for alternative modalities. Also, education plays a role in whether people switch. Results show that higher-educated people are more likely to step out of the car in comparison to lower-educated people. This might be due to income making it easier for higher-educated people to afford other modalities but many high-educated people also work in the service sector. Offices in the service sector are often located in easily accessible places making it easier to take public transport or the bike.

Regarding how people cause traffic to disappear showed the results that more respondents indicated for all the travel motives and scenarios that they would not make the trip anymore compared to the number of respondents that indicated that they would switch modalities. Especially for the travel motive ‘’Work and Study’’ is this the case where almost double the amount of respondents indicate that they would not make that trip anymore (24.4% vs.13.4%). In the case that people switch modalities, the bike is the most chosen alternative, especially for the travel motives ‘’Household & Services’’ and ‘’Work & study’’. Some respondents do choose public transport but not as much as the bike. Public transportation is mainly seen as a good alternative for the travel motives ‘’Social & Recreative’’ and ‘’Work & Study’’."

also known as brain gain, a phenomenon on the rise in Bulgaria. Despite its growing relevance,
limited research has been conducted to understand the decision-making processes and dynamics 
behind migrants’ return. There is also limited research on the effectiveness of policies and 
programs in attracting reverse migration, and the focus is shifted away from the opinion of the 
emigrants, resulting in a top-down approach. This thesis? aims to understand what the stimuli 
behind the decisions of returning are and how these stimuli are understood by the government 
and reflected in its initiatives. To do so, this thesis takes the Youth Bulgarian 
Migration and National EURES Network as a case study and discusses them through a bottomup approach. By learning from first-hand experience on the decision-making processes and 
finding how it relates or not to its programs, the government could point out the weakness of 
similar programs and improve its actions in the future. The theoretical framework introduces 
the prospect theory and the Return Preparation illustration. While the methodological tools are 
qualitative research based on eleven semi-structured in-depth interviews and the realist 
evaluation approach. The research concludes that reasons which encourage emigrants’ return 
are grouped under the dimensions of the job and economic conditions, social network, and 
personal aspiration. The first appears to be the base-stone for the return. The governmental 
programs and initiatives, however, appear to be of little importance to emigrants’ return. 
Although they fall under the category of jobs and economic conditions, and social 
networks, they do not match the needs of the returnees. As a result, this study emphasizes the 
importance of the bottom-up approach in studying brain gain. The results call for open 
communication between the target group and the authorities in charge."
"“You’re in a different world if you have a disability”: Exploring wheelchair users’ lived experience of public transportation in Amsterdam, The Netherlands","['Rees, Josephine']","['Gigengack, R.A.']",2022-10-29T00:01:06Z,EN,['wheelchair; disability; public transportation; actor-network theory'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Public transportation has been recognised as a crucial means to participate in society. Research indicates, however, that wheelchair users across the globe still face a range of physical and social barriers to public transportation use. While The Netherlands ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2016 — which includes an emphasis on accessible transportation — sources highlight that Amsterdam’s public transportation still does not meet the needs of its wheelchair users. With this in mind,
this thesis explores how wheelchair users experience public transportation in the Dutch capital. This thesis addresses the following question: How do wheelchair users experience public transportation in Amsterdam? To provide a framework to understand these experiences, a phenomenological approach was adopted. As Bruno Latour’s Actor-Network Theory emphasises that different actants interact to shape an experience, Latour’s approach further guided the analysis. The methodology included 11 semi-structured interviews with 12 manual and electric wheelchair users living in Amsterdam. Interviews were supplemented by participant observation trips, a Gemeente Vervoerbedrijf (GVB) accessibility workshop, and relevant photos. Findings suggest that wheelchair users’ lived experience of public transportation in Amsterdam is shaped by the built environment (platforms, lifts, and accessibility signage), staff and passengers (provision of help, staff knowledge, and a lack of passenger awareness), and policies (the wheelchair assistance policy, the wheelchair priority policy, and prohibited escalator use). This research thus concludes that wheelchair users' experiences of public transportation in Amsterdam are based on the interaction of different actants in relation to the built environment, staff and passengers, and policies. While public transportation can be experienced positively, a combination of elements frequently conspires to create major challenges for wheelchair users. Amsterdam’s policymakers and public transportation authorities, with the input of wheelchair users themselves, must therefore work together to achieve an accessible public transportation experience for everyone."

the decision-making process, because mothers may have stronger maternal feelings; but mothers may
also find the decision easier, because they know the impact having a child has on their lives. The
purpose of this study was to test these contrasting hypotheses. First, mothers were compared to
nulliparae on perceived doubt, emotional burden of the unwanted pregnancy and abortion, and positive
and negative emotions after abortion. Second, the number and type of reasons for abortion of these
groups were examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. The study was based on the first
measurement of the Dutch Abortion and Mental Health Study (DAMHS), a five-year prospective
cohort study (n=325). Data were collected through structured face-to-face interviews. Regression
models were used to test the hypotheses, controlling for age, education level, having a partner, and
living situation. Compared to nulliparae, mothers reported more often that they did not want children
(anymore). Nulliparae also gave significantly more reasons than mothers. Although motherhood seems
to influence the reasons mothers have for terminating the unwanted pregnancy, this is not the case for
the intensity or emotional burden of the decision making process. Thus, the results do not suggest that
mothers specifically need additional support in the decision-making process."

als een doeltreffend middel ziet voor het bieden van nieuw perspectief. De doelgroep waar Life Goals zich
op richt zijn kwetsbare mensen die om welke reden dan ook zijn vastgelopen in het leven (Stichting Life
Goals, 2022a). Met de slogan ‘#NeverOffside’ streeft Life Goals naar een samenleving waarin niemand
buitenspel staat. Hiervoor organiseert Life Goals al ruim tien jaar sport-als-middel-programma’s voor de
meest kwetsbare mensen in onze maatschappij. Sport is voor Life Goals het middel om deelnemers weer
het zelfvertrouwen te geven iets van hun leven te maken (Stichting Life Goals, 2022a).

Om personen in kwetsbare posities toegang te geven tot sport- en beweegaanbod zet Life Goals een
specifieke methodiek in. Deze methodiek betreft onder andere een interventie die bestaat uit het
organiseren van een sportevenement voor mensen in kwetsbare posities. Life Goals noemt zo’n
sportevenement een ‘Life Goals Festival’. Binnen de methodiek van Life Goals die onder andere bestaat
uit het organiseren van een sportevenement voor mensen in kwetsbare posities zijn er drie verschillende
soorten festivals te onderscheiden. In dit onderzoek wordt er enkel gericht op de lokale Life Goals
Festivals.

De doelstelling van dit onderzoek is om te achterhalen welke aspecten van de lokale Life Goals Festivals
deelnemers stimuleren om continuïteit aan te brengen in hun sport- en beweeggedrag, ook zonder of
buiten het Life Goals programma. Om de doelstelling van dit onderzoek te realiseren wordt er
gebruikgemaakt van de Theory of Change (ToC). De ToC is een model wat ingezet kan worden om
interventies en haar processen te evalueren. Dit model gaat na welke aspecten van een interventie, in de
vorm van een lokaal Life Goals Festival, volgens landelijke programmamakers & lokale organisatoren en
deelnemers bijdragen aan continuering van het sport- en beweeggedrag van kwetsbare doelgroepen

Welke aspecten van lokale Life Goals Festivals zijn volgens deelnemers uit kwetsbare groepen van invloed
op de continuering van hun sport- en beweeggedrag en hoe verhoudt dit zich tot de uitgangspunten en
aannames van de organisatoren van deze festivals?

Binnen dit onderzoek wordt er gebruikgemaakt van field- en deskresearch. Er wordt gebruik gemaakt van
een combinatie van kwantitatief en kwalitatief onderzoek, om zo tot een breder begrip en verzameling
van inzichten te komen. In dit onderzoek worden er twee landelijke programmamakers en vier lokale
organisatoren geïnterviewd. Daarnaast worden er tien deelnemers geïnterviewd op basis van twee
meetmomenten, verspreid over vier lokale Life Goals Festivals. 

Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat er tal van aspecten zijn die volgens de deelnemers van invloed zijn op
de continuering van hun sport- en beweeggedrag. Dit zijn plezier, begeleiding, structuur, verbinding,

mechanismen die in het lokale Life Goals Festival verwerkt zitten. De mechanismen die de aspecten
stimuleren die volgens deelnemers van invloed zijn op de continuering van hun sport- en beweeggedrag
zijn sporten met soortgelijken, socialiseren, omgeven zijn met mensen, duurzame vriendschappen,
positieve associatie met sport en vertrouwen. Dit komt grotendeels overeen met de uitgangspunten en
aannames van de landelijke programmamakers & lokale organisatoren. Daarnaast zijn er meerdere korte

Cultuurchristelijk Confessioneel: Een vergelijkend onderzoek naar Cultuurchristelijke invloeden bij de Christelijke Partijen in Nederland,"['Schaap, Lennard']","['Kennedy, James']",2022-11-03T00:00:36Z,NL,"['Cultuurchristendom, CDA, CU, SGP, Populisme, Moderniteit, Secularisme, Verlichting, Christendom, Confessionalisme']",Geschiedenis van Politiek en Maatschappij,"Cultuurchristendom is een verschijnsel dat veelvuldig aan het populisme wordt gelinkt. De beweging wordt als een ‘illiberal’ verschijnsel beschouwd waarmee populisten proberen de islam buiten het christelijke Europa te houden. In deze scriptie wordt cultuurchristendom vanuit een ander perspectief belicht, namelijk vanuit de christelijke partijen in Nederland. De invloed van cultuurchristendom op de SGP, de ChristenUnie en het CDA is de centrale vraagstelling. Allereest wordt daarom de ‘illiberal’ karakterisering van cultuurchristendom geproblematiseerd en vervolgens wordt het begrip cultuurchristendom in een breder en nieuw conceptueel kader geplaatst. Het conceptuele kader helpt om in het verdere onderzoek naar verscheidene debatten omtrent islam, godslastering en zondagsrust de cultuurchristelijke invloeden bij de drie partijen te duiden. De complexe relatie van christelijke partijen met deze niet-theologische vorm van het christendom is een relevante bouwsteen in het onderzoek naar de Nederlandse politiek sinds de populistische aardbeving na Fortuyn. Zelfs de kleine christelijke partijen worden beïnvloed door het cultuurchristendom, ondanks hun gelovige kiezers. Het CDA lijkt als brede volkspartij het meest ontvankelijk voor het cultuurchristendom, maar twee ongelukkige huwelijken met populisten hebben bij de christendemocraten de zaken op scherp gezet. Het christendom is op zijn op retour in Nederland, maar de christelijke politiek blijft een levendige en dynamische groepering."
Experimental Feminist Life Writing: Examining Autofiction and Autotheory as Strategies of Dissent,"['Dokter, Lea']","['Poletti, Anna']",2022-11-03T00:00:38Z,EN,['Life writing; experimental literature; genre; feminism; feminist theory; autofiction; autotheory; dissent'],Comparative Literary Studies,"This thesis examines genre-based experimentation in works of feminist life writing (namely reading Diane di Prima’s Memoirs of a Beatnik, Chris Kraus’ I Love Dick, and McKenzie Wark’s Reverse Cowgirl) as a practice of dissent, building on the developing frameworks of autofiction and autotheory. It approaches these concepts not as genres in their own right, but as formal and aesthetic strategies that open up a space for the performative expression of feminist dissent. Using the autofictional and the autotheoretical strategy, these works produce new discursive spaces for the reconsideration of gender and sexuality and their associated norms of propriety, pulling into question not just the gendering of genre, but also the genre of gender identity, and reframe the shape and function of the ‘auto’ within autobiographical narrative through experimental strategies. This thesis thus
contributes to the ongoing effort to claim a place for life writing as a serious artform within literary studies, and adds to the developing fields of autofiction and autotheory within the study of contemporary literature, both theoretically and by introducing two hitherto unexamined case studies."

In the field of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), it has been reported that multiple biases were introduced during word embedding training, and blindly applying the biased word embedding to decision-making tasks leads to fairness problems. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to eliminate or reduce these biases. Several debiasing algorithms have been proposed in previous research, including the Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP) method. However, few studies have analyzed debiasing for multiple attributes together, especially for multiple attributes that include more than 2 classes. In this study, we implemented multi-attribute debiasing for gender (binary) and race (tri-class) through 4 different strategies: 2 successive debiasing strategies (gender-race, race-gender); 2 simultaneous debiasing strategies (independent grouping, intersectional grouping). We validated the debiasing results by INLP classifier performance, bias measure (WEAT), and downstream task performance, and then evaluated and compared different strategies and other detailed parameters. We found that simultaneous debiasing tended to produce moderate results, while successive debiasing tended to produce extremely good or poor results depending on the debiasing order of attributes. In the future, these strategies could be used for debiasing of other attributes. Further theoretical analysis and more comprehensive testing are suggested."

It addresses the two main concerns for Facebook as a modern digital medium: fake news and polarisation. Subsequently, this thesis aims to answer the question of whose responsibility it is to tackle these problems. It will be argued how Facebook is the responsible party in doing this, which will be supported by the extent to which Facebook resembles a public sphere. Firstly, the public sphere as described by Habermas will be discussed. From this, the norms that define and regulate this as a public sphere will be distilled. Those will subsequently be applied to Facebook, which will show how Facebook in theory lives up to these norms, while in practice it deviates from them. It will also become clear why this inability to live up to the norms does not entail the norms should be abandoned entirely. The problems of fake news and polarisation will be discussed more in depth, and why these problems are especially troublesome in a public sphere. Lastly, after going over all potential actors with regards to their responsibility towards fixing the problems of Facebook, it will become apparent why Facebook is the only party that can and should do this."

Time-Symmetric Quantum Mechanics in the Block Universe,"['Rodriguez, Pascal']","['Hermens, Ronnie']",2022-11-14T00:00:32Z,EN,"[""Quantum Mechanics; Peaceful Coexistence; Time symmetry; Retrocausality; Temporal global correlations; Action-at-a-temporal-distance; Time-symmetric collapse models; Bell's Theorem; Block Universe.""]",History and Philosophy of Science,"The present thesis addresses a general and a specific research question. The general research question aims to explore whether the block universe perspective provides a smooth reconciliation between quantum mechanics and special relativity. The specific question is whether time-symmetric quantum mechanics requires retrocausality, action-at-a-temporal-distance, or mere temporal global correlations.

We assume a definition of the block universe perspective that requires fundamental time symmetry, so we ask whether time-symmetric quantum mechanics has properties that enable a local explanation for the violation of spacelike Bell inequalities. In this context, we analyse the retrocausal argument proposed by Price (2012) and the subsequent theorem advanced by Leifer (2017). These arguments maintain that, under certain assumptions, time-symmetric quantum mechanics requires retrocausality. A crucial element is that retrocausality takes the form of a violation of the measurement independence condition. Such a violation enables a local explanation for the results of Bell’s theorem. Therefore, if the block universe requires time-symmetry, a quantum theory compatible with this metaphysical perspective would be locally explained.

Nevertheless, there is another interpretation of what time-symmetric quantum theory entails, which is due to Adlam (2018). She claims that Leifer and Pusey’s theorem should be interpreted as involving temporal non-locality. Moreover, she argues that a temporally non-local theory implies action-at-a-temporal distance.

In this context, we offer a third interpretation of the retrocausality arguments, which maintains that time-symmetric quantum mechanics might require mere temporal global correlations. Temporal global correlations are non-local, but they do not require action-at-a-distance. Our argument is analogous to the interpretation developed by Myrvold (2016) for the spacelike case; while the violations of parameter independence imply action-at-a-distance, the violations of outcome independence exhibit mere global correlations. In the timelike case, unlike retrocausality or action-at-a-temporal-distance, temporal global correlations do not violate measurement independence, but (timelike) outcome independence. We reinforce our argument through an analysis of time-symmetric collapse models, a recent interpretation of dynamical collapse theories developed by Bedingham and Maroney (2017).

We conclude that whether quantum mechanics in the block universe provides a reconciliation with special relativity is an open question. On one hand, if time-symmetric quantum theories require retrocausality or action-at-a-temporal distance à la Adlam, then the block universe does reconcile quantum mechanics with special relativity. On the other, if time-symmetric quantum mechanics exhibits mere temporal global correlations, then it does not give us means to explain spacelike non-locality."
Finance for sustainability: How European actors can support sustainable small and medium-sized enterprises in Nigeria,"['Biemann, Maja']","['Westen, Guus van']",2022-11-11T00:00:48Z,EN,[],Sustainable Development,"To address the challenge of mismanaged plastic waste in Nigeria, this research investigates the main research question ‘How can European actors financially support SMEs active in Nigeria’s plastic waste management as a means to aid in achieving the local sector’s sustainability transition?’. To answer this, a mixed-method approach was applied, including the review of the existing literature base, collecting insights from Nigerian SMEs through an online survey and conducting actor interviews with individuals working in SMEs, investors and further actors relevant to the topic. The approach of service regimes by Welie et al. (2018) was applied to uncover the various services underlying the complex system. Accordingly, Nigeria’s plastic waste management sector has shown to consist of several service regimes that are insufficiently aligned, hampering sustainability on the sectoral level. Thereby, the Nigerian government is not the most suitable actor to address this since the consequences of Nigeria’s oil-dependency negatively impact the governmental framework. Instead, SMEs were identified as promising potential actors of change. Their position in the sector enables them to create interlinkages across several services. If incentivized, those links can be used to increase the sector’s sustainability and keep plastics from being mismanaged while simultaneously supporting the prosperity of the informal sector, for example. Due to the consultation of employees and investors, challenges and opportunities related to that were identified. Based on the findings, recommendations for the design of financial instruments for development finance were derived. Besides supporting the chances for the SMEs’ long-term survival, the recommendations address aspects like offering a greater variety of financing instruments to the SMEs and better considering the local context. Great importance was also dedicated to increasing transparency which can also contribute to reduced corruption. Furthermore, mutual learning should enable entrepreneurs to develop skills relevant to the waste sector and the business."

development to a more recent variant of SIA, where it is employed in the third and fourth sec-

experiencing growing pressure to demonstrate their impact on societal issues and the demand for
conducting SIA increased, many SIA methods and tools that enable these methods have been created. Within the domain of SIA, there is a lack of consensus and established standards and a lack
of research on rationale on the subdivisions of Impact Measurement families. This research aims
to increase the academic understanding of Social Impact Assessment by providing the groundwork
for a standard language to specify SIA methods, where we extend the open-source tool openESEA,
which currently supports the specification of Ethical, Social, and Environmental Accounting (ESEA)
methods. For this, we propose a new classification system to analyse and compare SIA methods.
By modelling and comparing existing SIA methods, we create a generic model that gives us an
overview of the main features of SIA. With these features, which includes a Theory of Change, correction mechanisms and indicators, we extend the meta-model of openESEA and its accompanying
DSL which can be used to specify SIA methods. Additionally, we conduct a market analysis on
the Dutch government-commissioned SIA method the Impact Path and nd that practitioners are
generally positive about the method, but it requires more collaboration, development, and extension

degree of spatial attention (Strauch et al., 2022a). We found pupil constriction to be a
significant predictor of RT as well as accuracy. Stronger pupil constriction indicated longer
RT and lower accuracy. We additionally replicated previous findings by Murphy et al. (2014),
baseline pupil size positively predicts accuracy. These results show we can indeed link the

A special field is laying focus on the interaction between children and robots, because their abilities and expectations, like strong human capacities, differ and socially engaging interactions are challenging. Therefore, in this project, it was examined if a child’s engagement can be increased by adding emotional
gestures, a general human skill and simple act of conveying emotional information, to a robot interaction. In two experiments, 249 children either interacted with a robot executing emotional gestures (i) or not (ii) on group vaccination days in the Netherlands. Engagement was measured with an adjusted quantitative coding approach for video analysis measuring the current engagement during the interaction. Further, participants reported engagement, anxiety, fear and trust via a questionnaire. Results show a higher engagement for the interaction under emotional gestures compared to no executed gestures. In addition, the interaction reduced state anxiety independent from one’s level of engagement. It is concluded that emotional gestures are a powerful distraction technique for a non-spoken interaction and support an enhanced human-like interaction. This thesis contributes important insights to the field, given that there is a lack of research comparing engagement quantitatively by observation in a real-life settings and by providing an effective strategy for increasing engagement and lowering state anxiety."

Results demonstrated that a history of guilt-induction was found to be positively associated with suppression and dysregulation, whereas no significant associations were found with integration. Moreover, it was found that young adults who were in the autonomy-supportive vignette condition and scored higher on history of maternal guilt-induction engaged more with emotional suppression compared to the other group who read the guilt-inducing vignette. On the contrary, young adults who were in the guilt-inducing vignette condition and scored lower on history of maternal guilt-induction engaged more with emotional suppression compared to those who read the autonomy-supportive vignette. Lastly, participants who read the guilt-induction vignette scored significantly higher on emotion dysregulation than those who did not.

Interrater reliability of sensory testing in patients with diabetic neuropathy,"['Kamm, Isabelle']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-11-12T00:00:33Z,EN,[],Geneeskunde,"Background: Peripheral neuropathy, occurring in 30-50% of diabetic patients, is the main risk factor for foot ulceration. In order to detect diabetic neuropathy, the continuous and dichotomous 39-item and the dichotomous 13-item Rotterdam Diabetic Foot Study test batteries (RDF-39-C, RDF-39-D, RDF-13-D) were developed. This study examined the interrater reliability of these test batteries in patients with diabetic neuropathy.
Methods: Interrater reliability of the 39-item test batteries was determined across one pair of raters, whereas reliability of the RDF-13-D was examined across two pairs of raters. Interrater agreement rates (IRA) and intraclass coefficients (ICC) were calculated to assess reliability.
Results: Sixty-five patients with diabetes and symptomatic neuropathy were included. Interrater agreement was found to be acceptable for the RDF-39-C test battery but low for the RDF-39-D (IRA = 84.6% and 73.3%, respectively). Regarding the RDF-13-D, agreement rates ranged from 64.3% for one pair of raters to 81.4% for the other pair of raters. ICCs were all above .80, indicating high correlation.
Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the continuous version of the RDF-39 test battery is reliable across different clinicians, but when measured dichotomously it is not. The level of interrater agreement of the 13-item RDF test battery is dependent on the pair of raters. Though raters do not always agree on the absolute total scores of both dichotomous test batteries, the results indicate that their ratings are highly consistent. Standardised training across clinicians may be important to improve reliability."

Closing the responsibility gap in AI: Can Kundera’s idea of taking responsibility address the responsibility gap?,"['Bouwman, Bart']","['Miltenburg, Niels van']",2022-12-06T01:00:55Z,EN,['AI;Artificial Intelligence;Liability;Responsibility Gap;Moral responsibility;Ethics;Kundera;Epistemological Excuse;Opacity;Ignorance'],History and Philosophy of Science,"The problem of the responsibility gap as described by Andreas Matthias in 2004, showed that our legal and moral responsibility practices are challenged in the context of Artificial Intelligence. In a nutshell, the responsibility gap is about the following question: when an AI causes harm, who is responsible? The programmer of an AI is not in direct control and is often not able to exactly predict the behavior of the AI, as a fundamental aspect of AI is its ability to learn and act autonomously. This means that, whenever an AI causes harm, we are left without a clear target or agent to ascribe moral responsibility to. Furthermore, the people responsible for creating the AI may claim ignorance by saying 'We did not know'. This is called the 'Epistemological Excuse', and is also a contributing factor to why the responsibility gap is created. AI creates a fundamental opacity that greatly increases the difficulty of locating moral responsibility.

In an essay titled: 'Moral Responsibility in the Age of Bureaucracy', David Luban, Alan Strudler, and David Wasserman talk about how opacity is also inherent in large bureaucratic organizations. The many departments and layers of an organization allow the people working in this organization to use the epistemological excuse. Due to the opacity that this complex structure brings, it is hard to definitively point to who was responsible for any harm the organization causes. This issue displays some parallels with AI as well; AI is also fundamentally opaque which is precisely what prevents us from locating moral responsibility. Luban et al. propose to solve this issue with the introduction of 'preemptive duties'. What this means, in a nutshell, is that people in an organization are expected to carry out certain obligations and tasks to minimize the opacity present, thus reducing the possibility of people using the epistemological excuse. They are morally obligated to minimize the moral opacity present as they know that they are part of a fundamentally opaque enterprise. In this way they can still be ascribed moral responsibility if it can be shown that they failed to fulfill their preemptive duties. Being ignorant when you know these preemptive duties are present then becomes culpable ignorance and consequently allows us to morally blame people for their failure to fulfill their preemptive duties. 

This expansion of culpable ignorance is not enough in the context of AI, however. AI cannot take responsibility itself as it is an abnormal moral agent, yet it can cause harm. Its programmers may have fulfilled all of their preemptive duties and thus, ordinarily, be rightfully excused from moral responsibility, yet it is precisely this that creates the responsibility gap: the opacity in AI remains, it is inherent in AI. In order to save moral intelligibility, we should thus want those responsible for creating and manufacturing AI to want to take responsibility, even though they were not directly responsible for the harm the AI caused. This may come in the form of a responsive duty as a moral obligation, yet it remains a question of the virtuousness of the people responsible for creating the AI to take responsibility. This is because forsaking the moral obligation to take responsibility does not consequently allow us to locate blame for the harm caused by an AI. It only allows us to blame the programmer for their apparent lack of moral character. This thesis has shown that responsibility-as-blameworthiness falls short in the context of AI, and we must thus turn to responsibility-as-virtue."
Biobased beehotel from flowerwaste,"['Castelein, Sofie']","['Wosten, Han']",2022-12-06T01:00:53Z,EN,['biobased; flowerwaste; beehotel; regenerative; waste-free; biodegradable; particleboard; circulair; bees; exterior use; building material; bio inspired'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"This research project was brought by Groot Packaging. Groot wants to help create a waste-free floral industry and has developed several circular and biodegradable products from flower waste. In this project we used flower waste as a circular material to create a new type of biodegradable particle board, which we called flowerboard. 

The flowerboard is made out of flower waste that was cut into small pieces, which were then bound together with a natural adhesive. This adhesive has been used in the wood panel industry as a substitute for the toxic glues that are normally used. It consists of tannins that occur in natural abundance in wood and bark and which protect the trees against bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi. By using these tannins as adhesive, this protection is also transferred to the flowerboard.  
We tested a few of the properties of the flowerboard to see if it was suitable for use as a bee hotel. As a bee hotel it would need to survive storms, fungi and rain. We therefore tested the strength, fungi- and water resistance of the flower board.
 
The strength of the flowerboard is similar to common wood particle board and stronger than gypsum plate. We considered this strength sufficient for building a bee hotel. The flower board was also very resistant against a common fungi, probably because of the properties of tannin and the heat pressing of the flowerboard. The flowerboard was not very resistant to water and therefore needed an additional coating. For this we used natural oils that repel water, with these oils the flowerboard was able to survive 24 hours of constant simulated rain.
Because of these promising properties we designed a bee hotel where we use flowerboard as the construction material. Since the lifespan of the flowerboard is unclear we designed the hotel to be as efficient as possible, without compromising our ideals of a fully biodegradable and functional hotel. The final design is attractive and commercially feasible to produce and sell. 

In the coming months a few of the hotels will be produced and tested outside. After these tests we will evaluate if we want to produce more or if they will serve as a show-piece and inspirational product only.    
If interest in the flowerboard arises we will continue to perfect and test the properties of the board. As well as find new functions and designs. We already successfully tested our method of production with other organic waste materials, which means that we might also expand this project with different waste streams. 
To conclude, we were able to create a unique and versatile material that has the properties to replace harmful artificial panels. We achieved this by using a previously unvaluable waste stream and in a completely environmentally friendly and sustainable way. As an added benefit, by using the flowerboard as a bee hotel, we also help repopulation of the bees. We hope that this board will inspire others and show that with the right knowledge and tools, a more environmentally friendly and regenerative future is just around the corner."
"Predicting the future of complex signals
The information bottleneck applied to the generalized Langevin equation","['Schulpen, Geert']","['Kegel, W.K.']",2022-12-07T01:01:05Z,EN,['Information theory; Information Bottleneck; Prediction; Generalized Langevin equation; Vector Autoregressive Model;  Compression'],Nanomaterials Science,"Biological systems live in dynamic environments and thus need to adapt to changes in that environment. However, adapting costs time, so the system needs to predict its future environment based
on past environments. Therefore, the system needs to store some information about this history
from which it is possible to make this prediction. What information is optimal to extract from the
signal history depends on the covariance function of the signal. The information bottleneck provides
a framework to determine what information is relevant for this prediction.
We look at a system that predicts the value of a signal generated by the generalized Langevin
equation at one specific future time. The generalized Langevin equation provides a non-Markovian
signal with a non-trivial memory function. We analyze two specific types of memory functions; an
exponential decay, and a combination between an exponential decay and a Dirac delta function.
These memory functions can generate a wide variety of signals. However, we find that the optimal
response for each memory function does not vary strongly with parameter changes. The information
bottleneck method requires discretization of the input signal. This discretization induces information
loss, which masks what information is necessary to perform the prediction.
A vector autoregressive model is constructed, which generates a discrete signal. This eliminates
the information loss by the information bottleneck. As such, we find the information required to
predict the future signal value for both signal types. For the exponential decay memory function, the
future is predicted optimally from the most recent three signal values. The prediction seems based
on determining the signal’s instantaneous position, velocity and acceleration.
For the combined exponential decay and Dirac delta function memory function, the future cannot
be predicted optimally from a limited set of past signal values. If the exponential decay is the more
important memory function, the response mirrors the previous case but is enhanced by a strongly
decaying exponential tail. This tail seems to elucidate the effect of the instantaneous Dirac delta
function. On the other hand, if the Dirac delta function is the more important memory function,
the response mirrors the result of the information bottleneck for the stochastic damped harmonic
oscillator (Lotte Slim, Masterthesis UvA, 2020). However, it is enhanced by a slowly decaying exponential tail. The tail seems to elucidate the effect of the history-dependent exponential decay memory function."

The data suffers from various problems inherent to underwater data making it difficult to even label. The goal of this research is to find out how this data can be pre-processed to mitigate these problems before training a deep learning model. Various image enhancement techniques are tried on the data and through subjective analysis, RGHS is selected as the best solution for the problems of this data. Several data augmentations are used to improve the trainingset even further. A YOLOv5 model trained on the enhanced data showed better results than one trained on unenhanced data. And despite the fact that the data was more problematic than most other (public) datasets, the model performed reasonably well and similar to models trained on other data. These results suggest that the pre-processing techniques applied on the problematic data had a positive effect, improving the data and making it more usable."

Based on the adaptive oscillation proposed by the dual process model, we hypothesized that higher levels of grief cognitions would be associated with lower levels of fluctuation in yearning and in emotional pain.
Methods: Participants´ (N = 55; 73% female) grief cognition and PGD symptom levels were assessed with an interview. In a subsequent 14-day ESM phase, yearning and emotional pain were recorded five times a day. The mean square of successive differences of yearning and of emotional pain was computed to estimate within-person fluctuations in each PGD symptom. Fluctuations in yearning and emotional pain were regressed on negative grief cognitions.
Results & Conclusion: While grief cognitions were associated with greater fluctuations in yearning, no significant effect on fluctuations in emotional pain was found. The positive correlation between cross-sectional grief cognitions and PGD symptom levels supported earlier findings. The study provides first findings describing the relationship between a person-related variable and fluctuations in everyday PGD symptomatology. Persisting fluctuations in yearning might indicate the necessity to target grief cognitions in interventions. Future ESM studies should investigate fluctuations in PGD symptoms in the two years post-loss."
Predicting Novasure surgery outcomes based on patient characteristics and treatment activities,"['Hulzebos, Zoey']","['Lu, X.']",2022-12-07T01:01:02Z,EN,['patient-level predicting; machine learning; novasure'],Business Informatics,"For 30% of the women, their daily life is influenced by heavy menstrual bleeding, meaning that their energy level, mood, work productivity, social interaction, family life, and sexual functioning alternate due to their menstruation cycle. Endometrial ablation, like the Novasure surgery, can be used as definitive surgical treatment. Endometrial
tissue is vaporised during this process, preventing the flow possibility. Such surgery has failed when tissue grows back, flow continues or complaints reoccur. Current medical research has found multiple prognostic factors associated with the failure of the Novasure surgery. While these factors are purely focused on the patient’s characteristics, the question arises whether process features as well point at the failure of the Novasure surgery. This research investigates in the use of historical data of Novasure patients to provide  evidence-based insights into current treatments and their impacts on the outcome of the Novasure surgery per patient. Using six machine learning algorithms in four experiments with patient characteristics and process features as potential prognostics factors, the most important features are predicted and the most effective algorithms is determined. Adenomyosis, age, BMI, cavity length, and cavity width are the patient characteristics which have the most influence on the outcome of the Novasure surgery. The addition of process features led to the awareness that investigating in care activities and appointments brings new insights in predicting reinterventions. Random forest, extreme gradient boosting and neural network are the algorithms which can be used best for predicting which patients are likely to undergo a reintervention."
"The impact of the corona pandemic on psychological distress in bereaved
students","['Krijt, Mark']","['Avis, Kate']",2022-12-06T01:00:44Z,EN,[],Clinical Psychology,"Governmental guidelines such as the closing of public amenities and restricting the amount of
visitors at home due to COVID-19 have led higher education students to feel more lonely,
lacking social support, and show increased levels of psychological distress. A specific
subgroup of higher education students who might be particularly vulnerable to the
consequences of the pandemic are bereaved students. COVID measures such as the inability
to attend funeral services physically could hinder bereaved getting support needed for the
process of their grief and increase psychological distress. The current study aimed to research
possible factors that could influence psychological distress levels in bereaved students who
lost somebody in the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aimed to research how the form of
funeral attendance could influence psychological distress through meaningfulness attached to
the funeral service. Further, it was hypothesised that loneliness could lead to higher levels of
psychological distress in bereaved students and that this effect was moderated by the usage of
avoidant coping styles. Through an online survey, students were asked to fill out several
questionnaires. Results showed no significant main effect for loneliness on psychological
distress and no moderating effect for avoidant coping between loneliness and psychological
distress. While there was a significant effect of form of funeral attendance on meaningfulness
and a significant effect of form of funeral attendance on psychological distress,
meaningfulness did not mediate the relationship between form of funeral attendance and
psychological distress. In the discussion implications and possible subjects for future studies
are discussed."
Not so Straightforward: Coming Out and Hetero-Professionalism at Work,"['Swaaij, Daphne van']","['Toorn, J.M. van der']",2022-12-06T01:00:49Z,EN,['LGBT; sexual orientation disclosure; heteronormativity; professionalism'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","The current research aims to explore the relationship between being “out” as LGBT in the workplace and perceived professionalism and whether heteronormativity in the perceiver moderates this connection. The hypotheses predict significantly lower levels of perceived professionalism of a gay colleague who discloses his sexual orientation at work compared to a gay colleague who conceals his sexual orientation. Furthermore, a significant negative effect is predicted between levels of heteronormativity in the perceiver and perceived professionalism of the gay colleague. Lastly heteronormativity in the perceiver is predicted to positively moderate the relationship between disclosure status and perceived professionalism, meaning that respondents who score high on heteronormativity would perceive a gay colleague who has disclosed his sexual orientation at work as less professional than respondents who score low on heteronormativity. This research is an experimental vignette study, in which participants are randomly divided into one of two conditions. Both groups will read an anecdote about an imaginary colleague who is homosexual; in the first conditions this colleague has disclosed his sexual orientation at work, in the second condition the colleague conceals his sexual orientation at work. Participants are then asked to fill in questionnaires about their perceived professionalism of the colleague and their own level of heteronormativity. The results show significant effects in the predicted directions for both independent variables, confirming the first and second hypotheses. No interaction effect has been found, rejecting the moderation hypothesis."

"Language as a Predictor of Anxiety, Depression, and Self-Efficacy Scores and Recovery Rate in Teenagers with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome","['Fennema, Mara']","['Deoskar, Tejaswini']",2022-12-10T01:00:57Z,EN,['language use; chronic fatigue syndrome; recovery prediction; self-efficacy; depression; anxiety; NLP; BERTje;'],Artificial Intelligence,"Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are being used in multiple areas of the healthcare sector. This thesis looks into the relationship between language use of teenaged patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and their anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, and CFS treatment outcome. This research aims to make it easier for healthcare professionals to get an indication of the level of a patient’s anxiety or depression, the measure of their self-efficacy, and whether or not a specific type of treatment will work for a patient. Using a short text written by the patient to get such an indication would facilitate an earlier start of effective treatment. This thesis uses data from 102 patients who received online email-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for its two main focus areas. The first focus area looks at the correlation between a patient’s language use and their anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy. This is done by training n-gram-based language models and Naive Bayes on the text in the emails to predict the patients’ anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy scores. The language models’ results were compared to those of models trained on randomly generated scores, and
it was shown that outputs of these models were statistically significant. The language model performed better than Naive Bayes, and it was concluded that there was a correlation between language use and anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy. The second focus area looks at how well the language used by the patients in the emails sent to their therapists can be used with various AI models to predict the level of their anxiety and depression, the measure of their self-efficacy, and their CFS treatment outcome. This was done using the number of non-agentic language features per email, Bag of Words, and BERTje embeddings. These features were used as input for both logistic regression models and neural networks. When using logistic regression, the models for predicting self-efficacy using BERTje embeddings performed best. The neural networks using BERTje embeddings outperformed the logistic regression models when predicting anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, and treatment outcome. Thus it was concluded that it is possible to predict anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, and patient recovery based on language use."
Digital Nudges for Social Behaviour Change: A Platform Fostering Inclusion through Personal Interactions,"['Robijn, Annejet']","['Hauptmann, Hanna']",2022-12-13T01:00:52Z,EN,"['Human-Computer Interaction, Behaviour Change, Behaviour Change Application, Persuasive Technology, Inclusion, Personal Interactions, Digital Nudges, Nudging']",Human-Computer Interaction,"Research indicates that fostering an inclusive culture is valuable for organisations, leading to better job
satisfaction, higher innovation in teams and higher company profits. However, there is no consensus on how
to effectively stimulate inclusive behaviour of employees through technology. Moreover, research is lacking
on how individual employees can contribute to this problem by having one-on-one interactions with other
employees. That led us to explore how digital nudges can be used to promote inclusive behaviour through
workplace interactions. The study was conducted through the use case of Burst my Bubble, an application
developed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The research question was answered through three sub-questions
regarding the effect of the current implemented nudges, the impact of the app on inclusion and the design
of new digital nudges. A think-out-loud study, 6-week pilot study and interviews pointed out the difference in
barriers experienced by users, resulting in a variety of adoption behaviours. By applying digital nudges aimed
at increasing adoption, enhanced engagement with making diverse connections can lead to increased
platform impact on inclusive behaviour by its users. However, our results should be viewed in the light
of several limitations, mostly due to a relatively low number of participants and a low adoption rate. Still,
based on combining the Persuasive Systems Design framework, Persuasive by Design model and personas,
we have been able to create promising suggestions for improved nudges could be created. The outcome of
our proposed list of ten digital nudges strongly indicate that designs promoting inclusive behaviour should
comprise reduction, tailoring, social influence, reminders, timing, social comparison, normative influence,
self-monitoring, trust and liking. These digital nudges may well sketch a roadmap for future research into
interventions that aim to improve inclusiveness within organisations. Furthermore, our novel design method
was found useful for designing new nudges. We would recommend future research to further test and
improve our design method and results, in order to demonstrate the usefulness of technology based nudges
with regards to influencing human behaviour in other contexts."

However, those infants still have long-term effects containing neurodevelopmental motor- and sensory impairments, and specific cognitive-, behavioural-, social- and emotional outcomes.
Aims- This scoping review aims to appoint the paucities of current MRI studies and their correlations with neurodevelopmental outcomes. We also aim to discuss the relevance of 7T MRI and its capability in infant EP prognosis. 
Methods and procedures- A PubMed database screening has been performed. Studies have been removed based on our exclusion criteria by screening the title and abstracts first. After this, the remaining full text articles were again screened on the exclusion criteria. Lastly, articles were manually added after a manual search to provide background information on premature-related brain injuries and prognostic biomarkers of MRI on long-term outcomes.
Outcomes and results- we identified 23 peer-reviewed articles, most (n= 17) were published between 2019 and 2022. A wide variety of variables like MRI sequences, MRI scoring systems, neurodevelopmental tests and the age of test administer were found. A general conclusion of the outcomes and the MRI prognostic biomarkers is provided, highlighting the paucities of 1.5T- and 3T MRI studies and the advantages of 7T MRI. 
Conclusion and implications- 1.5T- and 3T MRI studies predict motor- and severe cognitive outcome, however those studies lack in subtle or moderate findings, other neurodevelopmental outcomes or metabolic- and pathophysiological findings. 7T MRI would be relevant because spatial and spectral resolution increases, while the acquisition time remains the same. 7T MRITEA techniques as T2WI, SWI, PC-MRA, ihMT and MRS could reveal more prognostic biomarkers associated with long-term outcomes."

Previous neuroimaging research has shown that the anterolateral prefrontal cortex (alPFC) might play a role in the downregulation of fear after threat offset. By temporarily inhibiting neural activity of the alPFC, we explore the role of this area in the downregulation of defensive responses. Healthy participants (N=30) completed an instructed fear task before and after receiving active (right alPFC) and control (vertex) continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS). During all four fear tasks, fear potentiated startle, subjective fear measures, skin conductance response and electroencephalogram were measured. Previous results have shown that startle magnitudes were increased after cTBS stimulation of the right alPFC. Against expectations, this was found both during and after presentation of the threat cue, rather than specifically after cue offset. The current study failed to replicate these findings and found no significant difference following active versus control stimulation on any measures. These results raise concern regarding the impact of the cTBS on the brain itself. However, significant results were found for subjects who received active stimulation in the first session. In addition, the combination of the former and current startle datasets (N=51) yielded significant results, indicating that the effect of alPFC suppression on the downregulation of startle magnitudes is not entirely absent. Due to unclear outcomes and methodological concerns, the nature of the failed replication is unclear. More research with sufficient sample sizes should be done to provide clear conclusions regarding the remaining questions."

domains. These platforms accelerate the development of applications by letting devel-
opers build models in a higher abstraction. They also provide deployment and life-cycle
management functionality. As these platforms evolve, problems can arise. For exam-
ple, when metamodels and models do not conform to each other, the built software
will malfunction, and users of the application might not have the desired interactions.
Therefore the right decisions need to be taken. Change Impact Analysis (CIA) can
be done in order to assist developers of these platforms to support the evolution of
the platform. There is not much known about CIA in the context of LCDPs. There-
fore we conduct a literature review on the currently available approaches. We found
that almost no publications mention CIA in an LCDP context. There are however
various papers that present interesting directions for CIA within Model-Driven Engi-
neering which could be applied within LCDPs. Some of these techniques can be used
for general-purpose modeling languages such as UML, but some are only applicable to
domain-specific languages. These approaches generally made use of techniques such as
explicit rules and traceability in order to analyze changes. There are also several other
techniques that are more suitable for more advanced approaches. Recommendations
are given about how an LCDP supplier should build up their CIA for their platform.
With this knowledge, several directions are presented which researchers can explore to
improve this domain. Some of these gather more grounding of the current approaches,
provide users with improved feedback, or make their approach more correct and com-
plete. At last, recommendations are given to bring the found approaches closer to the
LCDP domain by suggesting case studies with other LCDPs"

By using CGI model Shudu as the perfect example for beauty, Wilson wants to ensure people are embracing beauty and perfection as there are many issues surrounding it. These issues mainly concern the negative influence technologies and media have on the self-esteem of women. These contribute to the widespread promotion of the perfect image. However, there are different approaches to technologies and the role they play in society from different perspectives. Shudu plays a role in the fields of tensions that emerge between these approaches. This thesis investigates her virtual identity by looking at her Instagram account @shudu.gram through the lens of the Cultivation Theory, and different perspectives on Simulations and Cyborg, which attempt to answer the following research question: How does CGI model Shudu and the degree of her authenticity, constructed through her Instagram page, contribute to the discourse around perfection and its influence on women’ s self-image in the digital age? This question is answered by conducting a slightly modified version of Teun A. van Dijk’s Critical Discourse (CDA) Analysis. First, the structure set up by the CDA allows the analysis of visual and textual elements in 10 Instagram posts of Shudu. This is done based on a matrix that analyses the tensions between authenticity and fakeness, and perfect and imperfect. In addition, the discourses surrounding the text production are analysed to see what Wilson’s intentions are with the creation of Shudu and check whether this is also portrayed as such at her Instagram page. Finally, this research examines the societal structures and power structures in which Shudu and the kind of perfection she represents reside. This relates to dimensions of power and access, and the tensions between fake and authenticity and perfect and imperfect. This gives insight into the form of perfection Shudu represents and the role its authenticity plays in the meaning of perfection. This research shows that Shudu’s virtual identity represents a humane form of perfection which makes her look authentic. Instead of being, as Wilson pointed out, an inspiring art project for people to enjoy, Shudu is considered authentic and understood as a digital creation consistent with the views of the fashion industry. It can be argued that Shudu’s degree of authenticity contributes negatively to the discourse around perfection, as she doesn’t deviate from the conventional beauty standards. The perfect image she portrays is received in such a way by society that she ultimately serves as comparison material, adding to the societal pressure among women to pursue the beauty standards."

heeft getracht de beginselen van het nationale identiteitsconcept in te kaderen en kwam tot de 
conclusie dat de (door)ontwikkeling van nationale identiteiten berust op een aantal ideologische en

van nationale sentimenten en identiteiten in vroegmoderne tijden aantonen. 

Wanneer we deze de oorsprong van de Nederlandse identiteit vanuit deze verschillende 
invalshoeken bestuderen, dan lijken beide benaderingen steek te houden. Er zijn verschillende 
mechanismes die nationale identiteitsformatie faciliteren, al is voor Nederland de gezamenlijke strijd

A Bio-Inspired Oscillating Underwater Fin for Generating Water Movement that Saves Plankton and Fish Larvae,"['Bas, Menno']","['Maas, Leo']",2022-10-29T00:00:50Z,EN,['biomimicry/biomimetics; hydrodynamics; cetaceans; marine aquaculture; circularity'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"The global human population is growing and so is the demand for food. At the same time, climate change and the loss of biodiversity is an increasing problem. The company BlueLinked is developing a saltwater fish farm on land, efficiently breeding both new wild fish and fish for consumption with the motto “one fish on your plate and one fish in the sea”. In big specially designed tanks, a tiny natural sea is mimicked. Here, small fish larvae are raised. To make the conditions as natural as possible, live algae and small food organisms are kept in the same tank. Everything is completely in balance. With this, the fish larvae are surrounded by their diet and the right size of food is available at all times. It is important that the water in the tank remains well mixed. A normal flow pump is not suitable for this, because it causes a lot of turbulence. The fish larvae and other small organisms are very vulnerable and will not survive this wild water.
This project investigated how a water flow can be created that leaves the fragile organisms in the water intact. This is done inspired by nature. As a result of millions of years of evolution, only the best functioning mechanisms in nature have been preserved. The tail fin of a whale is such a highly developed product of natural selection. Whales can swim very smoothly and efficiently through the water thanks to their tail fin. Its shape and flexibility ensure that the drag and pressure of the water are used in advantage for the movement through the water, using minimal energy. Prototypes have been made based on three different shapes of tail fins, which can be attached to a special device that moves vertically up and down above the breeding tank. The experiments conclude that the underwater fin based on the gray whale’s tail fin can is the most efficient in creating a proper flow. This oscillating fin is now used to create with minimal electricity needs a calm propulsive current in the breeding tanks at BlueLinked, in which all tiny organisms can survive. Inspired by nature and realised by science, the problem has been solved and a contribution is made to sustainable fish farming."
Variability in whole blood tacrolimus concentrations after oral and continuous intravenous administration in the early post-lung transplantation period: a retrospective multicenter cohort study,"['Dommelen, Julia van']","['Egberts, A.C.G.']",2022-10-29T00:00:47Z,EN,['Tacrolimus; variability; lung transplantation; oral administration; continuous intravenous administration'],Farmacie,"BACKGROUND: A relationship between high tacrolimus variability after lung transplantation (LTx) and an 
increased risk for rejection of the allograft or nephrotoxicity is increasingly suggested in literature. The highly 
variable bioavailability of tacrolimus after oral administration is thought to play a predominant role. In the 
clinical practice,there is no consensus on the optimal administration route, early after LTx,to obtain a reduced 
variability.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose is to investigate the effect of continuous intravenous and oral administration on 
tacrolimus variability early after lung transplantation.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, 224 patients received intermittent oral administration of tacrolimus 
and 298 received continuous intravenous administration. Intra-patient variability (IPV) and the time within the
therapeutic range (TTR) were calculated using daily tacrolimus whole blood concentrations from the first 14 
days after LTx. Linear regression was used to investigate the effect of the administration route on variability.
RESULTS: The mean IPV in the intravenous group, weighted for the number of samples available per patient, 
was 29.2% ± 10.9 compared to 31.7% ± 10.5 in the oral group, with a difference of 2.5% [95% Confidence 
Interval (CI) 2.0-3.1]. After adjusting for effect modifiers, the mean IPV in the intravenous group was 20.2% 
and 28% in the oral group, indicating a 7.8% difference [95% CI 5.3-10.4]. The unadjusted median TTR in the 
intravenous group was 30.7% (18.7-41.1) and in the oral group 23.6% (13.0-30.8). Univariate analysis showed 
a mean TTR in the intravenous group of 30.7% and of 23.6% in the oral group, showing a difference of -7.1% 
[95% CI -7.9 - -6.2]. After adjustment, TTR was 13.3% in the oral group and 27.7% in the intravenous group. 
Thus, the oral TTR was 14.4% lower than the intravenous TTR [95% CI -22.1 - -6.8].
CONCLUSION: The variability in tacrolimus concentrations, measured as IPV and TTR, is higher when 
tacrolimus is administered orally in the first 14 days after LTx in comparison to continuous intravenous 
infusion, with a switch to oral administration once the patient is more stable."
Segregation of Roma in Hungary's education system,"['Andrási, Diána']","['Hoogenboom, Marcel']",2022-10-28T10:00:32Z,EN,[],Social Policy and Public Health,"This study aims to summarize the causes and mechanisms of Roma educational segregation in Hungary. Several European countries face similar challenges, but Hungary, according to estimates, has the largest Roma population in relation to its total population, making it a good example. Based on the case study, a systematic review was conducted on the given social issue from the time of the regime change to the present. According to this study, the reasons for the segregation of Roma pupils in the Hungarian educational system are primarily related to the characteristics of the Hungarian educational setting and its high level of social selectivity. Pressure to separate from schools, performance gaps between students from different backgrounds, and fragmented school networks drive social selection in the Hungarian education system. Social selection is also influenced by governance failures, parental aspirations, and too many formal selection points. To eradicate this phenomenon, policy recommendations would include rationalizing the school network and implementing accountability mechanisms."
Single Parents’ Capabilities for Social Support and its Effect on their Health,"['Nuberg, Sophie']","['Yerkes, Mara']",2022-10-29T00:00:54Z,EN,['single parents; health; social support; Capability Approach'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Background: The health disadvantage single parents experience, compared to coupled parents, is often attributed to socioeconomic differences. This study looks into another explanation: differences in social support. Single parents report having difficulties maintaining social contact and its importance for one’s health is well established. This study explores the social support difference further by using the Capability Approach (CA). Differences in the value placed on a social network and differences in the perceived opportunities for a social network between single and coupled parents, might explain differences in social support. Methods: A quantitative analysis of secondary data was executed. The data came from the ERC project CAPABLE and was collected via an online survey in four countries. The data (n = 2138) were analyzed using the PROCESS-tool. Results: Single parents experience significantly worse health than coupled parents. However, no differences were found in social support. Therefore, it could not explain the health inequality. Value of a social network and perceived opportunities to maintain were significantly associated with social support. Single parents did not value a social network differently but do perceive fewer opportunities for one than coupled parents. Perceived opportunity for a social network was found to be a mediator between single parenthood and health. Conclusions: Although social support cannot explain the health disadvantage single parents experience, perceived opportunities for a social network can. This should be considered in future well-being interventions for single parents. This study used a broad conceptualization of single parents and used only the quantity of the support network as a measure of social support. This limits the results. The study showed the CA is a useful way of thinking about social support and other possible subjects."

This thesis addresses this turn by operationalising the concept of emotional resonance in collective action frames and applying it to the case of foreign fighters of the YPJ in North-East Syria. The operationalision entails three aspects: Emotional consistency, emotional centrality and emotional goals that have to be addressed by the frames. I order to apply these concepts to the case, texts and online communication by the YPJ and YPG are analysed for the emotions they evoke, using the NRC Emotion Lexicon created by Mohammad and Turney at the National Research Council Canada to detect emotions in text. The frames are then analysed for their emotional consistency, centrality and goals for foreign fighters, using secondary data collected in the form of interviews, personal statements and account’s of friends and family of the individuals. The results show that while all criteria have to be fulfilled to a certain extend, the emotional goals an SMO addresses can mitigate low or insufficient emotional centrality and render a frame emotionally resonant."

However, most policy initiatives and studies focus mainly on motivational factors, and neglect these contextual factors. This study applies the COM-B model as theoretical framework, as it explicitly considers both personal and contextual factors in behaviour change. Based on semi-structured interviews (n = 15), this study aims to answer the question: ‘How do factors related to capabilities, opportunities, and motivation and their interrelations promote or hinder students’ transition to plant-based foods?’. Students are motivated to eat less animal-based products. However, for most of them external factors are hindering for their transition to plant-based foods. Hindering factors are predominantly: their knowledge about what the most sustainable options are, lack of clear and unambiguous information provision, the supply and price of good substitute products, and their social environment. In line with the COM-B model, factors related to capability, opportunity, and motivation were indicated to be important, and to interact in the transition to plant-based foods. However, the impact of hindering factors seemed larger for participants who were less engaged in the transition. For this reason, reducing the impact of hindering factors and facilitating the transition to plant-based foods is an important challenge. Specifically focussing on the hindering and facilitating impact of external factors (opportunity) can have a large impact on the behaviour of students who are (somewhat) motivated to reduce their meat-intake."
Gender Equality in Mental Health During the Covid-19 Pandemic and Leisure Time,"['Overeem, Amely']","['Ditzhuijzen, J.M. van']",2022-10-29T00:00:55Z,EN,['Gender (in)equality; Mental health; Parents; Leisure time; Covid-19'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Introduction: A cross-sectional and longitudinal study was conducted among parents (N=483) in the Netherlands. The aim of this study was to investigate if mothers mental health was lower during the  COVID-19 pandemic than fathers, and whether this difference between mothers and fathers was mediated by the difference in experienced leisure time change as a result of COVID-19 measures. Methods: Participants completed three different questionnaires from the LISS panel with regards to Health and Gender inequalities in times of the Covid-19 pandemic and answered questions about their mental health and leisure time. Data was analyzed using the Baron and Kenny method for mediation analysis. Results: The results provided support for the relation between gender and mental health. Mothers reported a lower mental health than fathers. The results also provided support for a relation between gender and change in leisure time. Mothers were more likely to experience a decrease in leisure time than fathers. However, the results did not provide support for a mediation of leisure time change in the relation between gender and mental health. Finally, results showed a gender difference in effect of leisure time on mental health. Discussion: This study found a mental health gap between fathers and mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic, but this gap is not different from the existing gap prior to the pandemic. Leisure time change does not mediate the relation between gender and mental health, which can be explained by the result that leisure time has a different effect on mental health for fathers, compared to mothers. This study suggests that in potential future COVID-19 measures, attention should be paid to the impact of these measures on gender differences in leisure time and mental health. In order not to increase gender differences, but to reduce them."

Comparing hydrogen networks and electricity grids for transporting offshore wind energy to shore in the North Sea region. A spatial network optimisation approach.,"['Brosschot, Steffan']","['Kramer, Gert Jan']",2022-11-07T00:00:42Z,EN,['Network optimisation; North Sea; energy networks; hydrogen; pipeline; electricity; cable; spatial optimisation; offshore wind.'],Energy Science,"In the North Sea (NS), offshore wind farm (OWF) capacity is expected to explode in the coming years to support decarbonisation goals. To bring these vast amounts of energy to shore, offshore hydrogen production and transportation to shore via pipelines is seen to be a plausible solution. Previous literature has investigated spatially explicit hydrogen networks in the Dutch extended economic zone (EEZ). However, capacitated networks were not considered. This research builds on the previous literature and addresses the following: 1) the effects of spatial complexity and reuse of oil & gas (O&G) infrastructure on networks, 2) the properties of a fully interconnected NS network and 3) a comparison between hydrogen networks and electricity grids.

A three-part model was devised; creating cost surfaces, generating candidate networks and finding optimal network layouts. A cost surface is created using PyQGIS, assigning weighing values to spatial uses in the NS. Using these cost surfaces, candidate networks (PyQGIS) are generated by running least cost paths between sources (offshore hydrogen supply points), sinks (onshore hydrogen demand points), and existing network infrastructure in the NS. Finally, the optimal network layout model (Python) is used to find capacitated infrastructure networks. Costs are calculated in post-processing, finding the network and system levelised costs of hydrogen (LCOH).

The results show that including spatial complexity increases capacity-lengths by 50% - 90% compared to a greenfield approach, as the network routes around high ’cost’ spatial uses. Reusing infrastructure leads to cost savings of 40% for hydrogen networks, as 84% of the network consists of reusing existing O&G infrastructure at low costs. Smaller savings are seen for electricity grids (5%), as only cable corridors can be reused, which do have a low cost saving. Interconnected networks are 38% (hydrogen) to 58% (electricity) larger when compared to isolated networks. Careful planning of interconnection is required to avoid overinvestments in capacity between countries. The interconnected network costs of hydrogen networks range between 14 - 21 B€, while electricity grids range between 87 - 116 B€. In a system context, the difference in LCOH between all scenarios
is small, between 1.95 and 2.15 €/kg, suggesting that offshore hydrogen is competitive in 2040.

Based on this study, recommendations can be given. Firstly, extending the scope of the onshore onshore hydrogen backbones to offshore can provide significant cost savings by reusing infrastructure. To facilitate this, regulatory support is needed for integrating O&G infrastructure with OWF and energy islands, as it is currently lacking. Investigating the interactions between spatial uses and network planning can feed marine/maritime spatial planning in order to define large interconnected corridors across EEZs for future installations of infrastructure. These corridors could allow sensible interconnection between countries, avoiding unharmonised networks. Finally, future research should widen the optimisation scope to consider onshore connections and dynamic hydrogen supply and demand, leading to more accurate representations of offshore connections in the NS, while avoiding unnecessary costs in overcapacitated connections."
Vervoersarmoede door Autoluw?,"['Knaap, Crit van der']","['Pelzer, Peter']",2022-11-05T00:01:06Z,NL,"['Vervoersarmoede; Autoluw; Ontplooiingsmogelijkheden, Mixed methods; Vervoersongelijkheid, Brede Welvaart']",Spatial Planning,"The effects of car-lite measures on transport poverty have hardly been investigated. Nevertheless, car-lite measures are increasingly being implemented in many Dutch cities. Car-lite allows for different use of (available) space in cities. The current and increasing demand for space by the automobility system cannot be sustained in the future. 	
Intervening in the existing transport system through car-lite measures may increase or decrease existing discrepancies in people's opportunities for development. In other words, people may experience an increase or decrease in the risk of transport poverty due to car-lite measures. It is expected that the effects of each car-lite measure - measured against the policy objective and local government context - will not be the same for each measure. In addition, looking explicitly at the effects of car-lite on transport poverty can contribute to the knowledge gap in the broader field of transport poverty. This led to the following main research question: How do different municipalities in the Netherlands implement the car-lite concept and what are its effects on transport poverty?

The main result was found in the combination of presumptions among mobility experts on the effect of car-lite measures on the risk of transport poverty and the case study conducted with two modeled car-lite measures. 	
An assumed negative effect of car-lite measures on the risk of transport poverty is found in the discrepancy in the parking standard used between the existing city - with an average parking standard - and the densification locations/ expansion areas with a much lower parking standard.	
The modeling indicates a predominantly positive effect of the car-lite measures taken on the risk of transport poverty. Job accessibility by public transport increases, while job accessibility by car does not decrease excessively.

The results of this study are indicative, this is due to two main reasons. First, a limited number of experts were spoken to. For various reasons, 'key' municipalities in this study did not participate in the discussions on a possible link between car-free measures and an effect on the risk of transport poverty. A second reason why the results are indicative is the non-comparative case study and the limited number of projected car-lite measures. Ideally, a full-fledged traffic model would have been used - focusing on Overvecht. This was not possible because the model has to be made by a specialist and the cost far exceeds the purpose of the study. For this reason, Rijkswaterstaat's Mobility Scan was used.

This study succeeded in investigating global effects of car-lite measures on the risk of transport poverty. Responses from municipal mobility experts have provided insights on potential weak points in urban developments with regard to car-lite areas and people's accessibility. Through a case study - however limited in its scope - it shows a picture where a widely taken measure (speed reduction) does not have excessive adverse effects on the car user at a travel time that is acceptable (±45 minutes). The incentive measure shows that public transport can increase job accessibility without harming job accessibility via car. Thus, car-lite measures can boost car-dependent groups and those relying on public transport in their job accessibility without putting transport-type-dependent groups at a disadvantage.

Several recommendations have been issued to support municipal authorities and several suggestions are made for follow-up research. A major piece of advice to municipalities is: Embrace Broad Prosperity and use it as a goal in considering mobility measures. Broad Prosperity takes a broader view (including transport poverty) when considering policy and mobility measures than is often the case now."

However, past research has produced inconsistent results on the association between ADHD and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The main aim of this study was to investigate the association between ADHD and cardiovascular health in women who attended the cardiac outpatient clinic in Utrecht. 
Data were analyzed from electronic health records of 300 individuals aged 18 years and above who visited the clinic between May 2021 and May 2022. ADHD symptoms were assessed with the self-reported ultra-short questionnaire for ADHD. The primary outcome included the presence of atherosclerosis as measured by carotid ultrasonography. 
ADHD in women was not a significant predictor for atherosclerosis. We found significant association between ADHD and alcohol use, but no association was observed between ADHD and obesity, type 2 diabetes, smoking, and drug use. Our hypothesis that women with ADHD are more likely to develop coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) was not confirmed. No significant associations were found between ADHD and CVD (atherosclerosis and CMD) in women. Both ADHD and CVD are underdiagnosed and undertreated in women. This can lead to mental and physical health impairments. To protect women’s health, further research is required to better understand the relationship between ADHD, cardiovascular risk and CVD."
Exploring opportunities of addressing conflicts between fisheries and offshore wind energy industry − from a stakeholder participation perspective,"['Chen, Yi Sin']","['Laerhoven, Frank van']",2022-11-06T00:00:33Z,EN,['offshore wind energy; renewable energy; fisheries; conflict; stakeholder participation'],Sustainable Development,"The increasing demand for renewable energy and the developing climate awareness has accelerated the growth of wind energy. Owing to the availability of resources and the technological advancement of cost-efficiency, it has promoted the rapid development of offshore wind energy. However, the development of offshore wind power and preexisting maritime industries and communities, that is, fishery, have created a conflict of marine space use and a clash of interest.

The conflict between these two industries may lead to potential obstacles to the development of marine renewable energy. Previous studies have shown that the participation of stakeholders will not necessarily resolve conflicts of interest, but it could increase mutual trust among participants and reduce the difficulty of developing offshore wind energy. It can be said that fishery stakeholders participate in the offshore wind energy planning process plays an important role in the energy transition.

This research presents the opportunities of the fisheries stakeholder involved in developing offshore wind farms in the UK and Taiwan, mainly focusing on the latter. The aim of this analysis is to ultimately reduce or prevent the conflict between the offshore wind industry and fishery in Taiwan by comparing a developed practice of stakeholder participation in the UK with the fledgling case in Taiwan.

Through documents analysis and interviews with stakeholders, it is found in this research that the participation mechanisms could lead to the dominance of empirical data and technocrats, which is observed in the two cases, while the case in the UK provides more room for fishery stakeholders to involve. In addition, informal consultation, consistent data, and adequate representation of fishers could effectively raise the trust of fishery stakeholders, thereby decreasing conflicts."
Belief in and Personal Experience with Stage Models of Grief amongst Bereaved Individuals,"['Spinas, Brogan']","['Avis, Kate']",2022-11-04T00:00:53Z,EN,[],Clinical Psychology,"Despite accumulating evidence against stage models of grief, these models remain widely accepted and endorsed with potential negative implications for bereaved when their grief is not experienced in stages. The current study investigated whether: a) a positive association exists between intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and belief in stages of grief; b) a positive association exists between negative personal experience with stage models of grief and grief symptoms; c) avoidant coping moderates the association between negative personal experience with stages of grief and grief symptoms. The study employed an exploratory, cross-sectional design using data obtained from an online survey. Participants (N = 122), aged between 18 and 60 years, were bereaved individuals who had experienced the loss of a loved one within the last 5 years. Results of simple linear regression analyses revealed no significant association between IU and belief in stages of grief nor between negative personal experience with stage models and grief symptoms. The moderation analysis revealed avoidant coping as having no moderating effect in the latter association, however avoidant coping was found to significantly predict grief symptoms. Despite its limitations, it is hoped that the current study encourages future research to further investigate variables that may influence belief in stage models of grief and the potential negative impact of stage models when bereaved do not experience their grief in stages."
Regulation and production of anthocyanins in Lactuca sativa,"['Dekker, Simon']","['Snoek, Basten']",2022-11-04T00:00:55Z,EN,[],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Anthocyanins are purplish pigments that are often induced by stress conditions in many plants. They protect plants against various stresses due to their antioxidant properties. These antioxidant properties also cause anthocyanins to possibly be beneficial for human health when consuming anthocyanin-rich plants. For engineering crops to produce more anthocyanins in their tissues, the genetics behind the production of anthocyanins needs to be understood. While the conserved biosynthetic pathway has been characterized in many plants, regulation of anthocyanin production differs between species. Lettuce, one of the most consumed leafy vegetables in the world, is a crop that has red varieties with high amounts of anthocyanins. How the exact underlying genetics behind this increase of anthocyanins work is only partly understood. In this review, the current understandings of the genetics behind anthocyanin production and regulation in lettuce and Arabidopsis thaliana are discussed. As most research on plant genetics is done in Arabidopsis thaliana, the knowledge of anthocyanin production and regulation in this model organism are used as a basis to compare research on lettuce with. This knowledge can be used in the future to cultivate healthier lettuce variants with higher concentrations of anthocyanins."

Renoveren, slopen en herbouwen, het zogenaamde klassiek herstructureren, heeft al minstens vijftig jaar als doel om de fysieke kwaliteitsachterstand van de gebouwde omgeving te verbeteren in Rotterdam (Maandag, 2019). Tegenwoordig heeft herstructureren niet alleen als doel om de technische kwaliteitsachterstand van gebouwen en openbare ruimtes te verbeteren, maar ook het vergroten van de woondifferentiatie en het verbeteren van de sociaaleconomische achterstand in de wijk door het aantrekken van midden- en hogere-inkomensgroepen (van Beckhoven & van Kempen, 2002; Uitermark et al., 2007; Ouwehand, 2019; PBL, 2022). Er is veel kritiek geuit op herstructurering, met name omdat het kan leiden tot verdringing van de laagste sociaaleconomische klasse en niet leidt tot het oplossen van sociaaleconomische problematieken (Hochstenbach & Musterd, 2018).

Vandaag de dag speelt een vergelijkbare discussie, nu over verdichten. Een stadsontwikkeling waarbij – in tegenstelling tot klassiek herstructureren – meer woningen bijkomen in plaats van verdwijnen. De recente toename van nieuwe woningen in bestaande buurten heeft onder wetenschappers de interesse gewekt naar verdringingsdruk bij gevestigde bewoners (Davidson en Lees, 2000; 2010). Verdringingdruk betreft een gevoel van vervreemding dat gevestigde bewoners kunnen ondervinden wanneer ze zich niet meer thuis voelen in de buurt door bijvoorbeeld buurtverandering (Davidson & Lees, 2010; Liu et al., 2017; Easton, et al., 2020).

De effecten van klassieke herstructurering en verdichten zijn dus nauw met elkaar verbonden, hierdoor ontstaat de discussie of het gevolgen van verdichten vergelijkbaar zijn met die van een klassiek herstructureringsproces en of dit ten koste gaat van gevestigde buurtbewoners. Dit leidt tot de volgende hoofdvraag in dit onderzoek: “Hoe beleven gevestigde bewoners de buurtbinding na herstructurering?

Using the diffusion of innovations framework, this research examines the effects of medicine-, country-, and company-level factors on access to essential medicines centrally authorized in the EU. 
Methods: This study contains a cross-sectional examination of 72 essential medicine authorizations in 8 LMICs. Logistic regressions were conducted to determine the impact of medicine- and company-level factors. Kendall's tau non-parametric correlation was used to determine the relationship of local medicine authorizations to country-level factors. 
Results: Access to essential medicines centrally authorized in the EU varied across LMICs. Medicine- and company-level factors were significant predictors of authorizations, while country-level factors correlated with different essential medicine authorizations in LMICs - results varied on a country-by-country basis and no factor alone could explain differences in access to medicines in LMICs. 
Conclusion: Differences in access to essential medicines in Europe vs LMICs, as well as between LMICs, is alarming and indicative of future research to better understand this problem. Future research should explore additional medicine-, country-, and company-level factors, and delays experienced in access to essential medicines to obtain a full understanding of diffusion of essential medicines in LMICs."
Effect of an educational intervention on prolonged oxycodone use after painful surgery,"['Meijer, Yvonne']","['Bouvy, M.L.']",2022-10-28T00:00:43Z,EN,['opioids; oxycodone; postoperative oxycodone use; educational intervention'],Farmacie,"Background
Prolonged opioid use following surgery is common and may lead to opioid dependence, tolerance and addiction. Previous research demonstrated that patients often report a lack of knowledge about their pain therapy. Some educational interventions have been described to lead to safer and reduced opioid use.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of an educational intervention on prolonged opioid use (2 and 4 weeks) following painful surgery. Secondly, satisfaction about the information provided was recorded and risk factors for prolonged oxycodone use were identified.

Methods 
All Dutch-speaking adult patients that underwent painful surgery (orthopedic surgery, neurosurgical spine surgery, traumatology surgery or bariatric surgery) in the St. Antonius Hospital were asked to participate. The educational intervention consisted of a patient information leaflet and a short educational session for trauma, anesthesiology and orthopedic residents. The first cohort of patients did not receive any education (control group), while the second cohort of patients received the information leaflet (intervention group). Surveys were sent to patients two (and four) weeks after surgery through email. The primary outcome was oxycodone use two and four weeks after surgery, the secondary outcome was patients’ satisfaction regarding oxycodone information provided. Binary logistic regression was used to determine predictors for prolonged oxycodone use.

Results
The proportion of patients that used oxycodone did not differ 2 weeks (10.3% in control group, 15.1% in intervention group, p=0.187) and 4 weeks after surgery (3.3% in the control group and 6.8% in the intervention group, p=0.386). There was no significant difference in satisfaction about oxycodone information between the groups (p=0.098). A strong negative relation between patients’ satisfaction regarding the information provided and prolonged oxycodone use was found (p=0.000). Preoperative oxycodone use (p=0.000) and preoperative anxiolytic or antidepressant medication (p=0.009) were associated with prolonged oxycodone use.

Conclusion
This simple educational intervention did not result in decreased oxycodone use 2 and 4 weeks after painful surgery or increased patient satisfaction."

It had previously been reported that UA could trigger inflammatory responses by activating some transcription factors, such as Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB), and induce the expres- sion of proinflammatory cytokines of the interleukin-1 family, such as IL-1β and IL-18. Although the NLRP3-dependent inflammation by UA is studied in multiple cell types, simulation of the phys- iological environment for UA crystal formation in conditionally immortalized primary tubular epi- thelial cells (ciPTECs) and the down-stream inflammatory processes has not been well defined. Here, we evaluated the effect of UA on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome considering different pH levels and timepoints. Exposure of ciPTECS to UA in reduced pH levels resulted in more significant changes in cell viability across UA concentrations compared to physiological pH. Also, exposure to UA increased expression of IL-1β on protein level, particularly in lower pH levels. Furthermore, UA induced expression of Caspase-1, TNFα and ASC in a concentration-, and pH- dependent way. However, it was observed that expression of IL-1β and NLRP3 did not follow a concentration-dependent trend across some pH-levels. In this case, other mechanisms might be in- volved in UA induced IL-1β and NLRP3 mRNA expression. In conclusion, we showed that UA reduces viability in ciPTECs and inducing expression of inflammasome-mediated markers of caspase-1, ASC, TNFα on mRNA and IL-1β on protein level, particularly when UA concentrations were elevated and pH levels were lowered."

sustainable diet. Although much effort is being made worldwide to reduce meat consumption,
figures show that meat consumption in the Netherlands has stagnated. Previous studies
applied the Value-Belief Norm Theory to show that self-transcendence values are positively
and self-enhancement values are negatively related to reducing meat consumption. Other
studies focussed on motivations for reducing meat consumption, i.e., animal welfare,
environment and health. Building on this knowledge, the current study used quantitative data
from the Dutch LISS Panel to investigate the relationship between values and motivations and
how this influences reducing meat consumption. Results confirm the positive effects of the
altruistic and biospheric values and the negative effect of egoistic values on meat replacement
product consumption (MRPC). Furthermore, although some effects were small, this study
demonstrated that moral motives (animal welfare and environment) appeared to completely
mediate the relationship between altruistic values and MRPC, and these motives partially
mediated the relationship between biospheric values and MRPC. Furthermore, results also
showed that the self-interested motive (health) potentially positively influences individuals
with egoistic and hedonic values to reduce their meat consumption as well, through a small
moderating effect on this association. The results implicate how motivations explain the
relationship between values and the pro-environmental behaviour of reducing meat
consumption. More importantly, the self-enhancing values could potentially not undermine
sustainable meat consumption by increasing health motives. In practice, these insights aid in
linking more effective interventions to groups with specific value profiles by targeting their
associated motivations and helping reduce their meat consumption."
Building Successful COVID-19 Interventions: Increasing Vaccination Participation in the Netherlands,"['Koenen, Liselot']","['Bal, Michèlle']",2022-10-28T10:00:44Z,EN,[],Social Policy and Public Health,"Background Development of a safe and effective vaccine is not enough to mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The public must also be willing to vaccinate. To overcome the multiphased problem of vaccine hesitancy and achieve adequate vaccine coverage requires well-structured and targeted vaccine interventions. It is important to gain insight into the design process used to set up COVID-19 vaccination interventions to help answer the question of how to successfully develop interventions to increase vaccination participation. This study identified the vaccination interventions executed in the Netherlands and investigated the theoretical framework and design process used to plan these interventions.

Methods A mixed-methods study comprising of two phases was performed in the Netherlands. Phase 1 involved a document analysis of 27 documents provided by the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport and RIVM to develop a matrix of executed COVID-19 vaccination interventions. Phase 2 entailed qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 8 identified experts that have experience implementing, devising, and/or inventorying the national and local COVID-19 vaccine interventions. Purposive sampling was used to represent the various regions of the country. The interviews verified the interventions in the matrix and added insight into how and why these interventions were set up.

Results Findings illustrated a lack of information and evidence of a theoretical framework used during the pre-planning of vaccination interventions in the Netherlands. The Theory of Change (ToC) approach is a powerful tool that can help successfully design interventions to improve vaccination uptake.

Conclusion This research adds to the growing recognition of the vital role a systematic design theory such as the Theory of Change (ToC) plays in significantly increasing the positive effects of vaccine interventions. Reporting on the ToC on the executed and future vaccine interventions will be the subject of future work."

This study aimed to investigate the effect of the different explanatory theories: transferability of human capital, adaptation process, abilities and discrimination between immigrant groups on the incidence of overqualification.
Methods: Survey data from the Survey Integratie Minderheden (SIM) was used for this study (N =935) . Binary logistic regression models were created to examine the association between immigrant group and the interactions of immigrant group with years spent on the Dutch labour market, Dutch language abilities and discrimination with the likelihood of not being correctly matched to their job, being overqualified, being underqualified and being educated for something else.
Results: The results show that the main effect of immigrant group and the interaction of immigrant group with years spent on the Dutch labour market and with Dutch reading abilities on the likelihood of overqualification are not significant. The interaction of immigrant group with Dutch speaking (Wald=15.234, df=4, p=.004) and writing abilities (Wald=15.239, df=4, p=.004) and with discrimination (Wald=23.474, df=4, p<.001) on the likelihood of overqualification is significant.
Conclusion: The incidence of overqualification for immigrant groups is affected by Dutch speaking and writing abilities and by discrimination. Further research is recommended to investigate these significances with a better fit database."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether students show unhealthier eating behavior if they come from a family of a low socioeconomic status (SES). The second aim of this study was to investigate if perceiving social support from home positively influences the eating behavior of students, and whether family support and SES socioeconomic status interacts on eating behavior. 
	The students participated in a questionnaire from HBSC in 2018 with questions about health, wellbeing and the social context of the students. 
 The results of this questionnaire suggest that there is a reliable correlation between unhealthy eating behaviors and living in low SES conditions. The results also provide insight in the relationship between the perception of social support from home and eating behavior. Students who perceive more family support, show healthier eating behavior. However, there is no significant relationship between the interaction of perceiving social support and level of SES on eating behavior of the student. 
	Families of a high SES can provide healthier food for their children because they have more resources. Conversely, families of a low SES have to deal with more challenges and therefore need to make choices that are financially oriented. Students who perceive more family support show healthier eating behavior, because they are more likely to copy the behavior of their parents. Hereby it is also interesting for further research to include the eating behavior of parents to compare their dietary habits with their child’s habits."

Governing MaaS; The governance of Mobility as a Service in the municipality of Amsterdam,"['Poels, Maud']","['Witte, Patrick']",2022-11-01T01:01:39Z,EN,['Mobility-as-a-Service; Digital platforms; Governance; Urban Political Economy; Platform Urbanism'],Spatial Planning,"Mobility as a Service is increasingly referred to as a solution to mobility systems that are under pressure and reached their maximum capacity, and to face the mobility problems that are experienced. MaaS is namely believed to be a new mobility paradigm with which mobility systems should become more sustainable and efficient. This new paradigm causes fundamental shifts in how mobility is organised and used, and how cities function. A new governance model is then required to manage the mobility systems. In this research, therefore, the impact of MaaS on the governance of the mobility system of Amsterdam was examined. By using multiple qualitative research methods – document analysis, stakeholder workshops, and semi-structured interviews – the research questions have been empirically investigated.

The outcomes demonstrate that Amsterdam has drawn up various goals to achieve with MaaS. The priority is to place users at the centre of the mobility organisation. But in addition, the municipality has established various social and policy objectives that it wants to achieve with MaaS to make the city more attractive and liveable. MaaS should herein be seen as a tool that facilitates the transition to a new mobility system, but MaaS cannot achieve all of these goals individually. Accordingly, MaaS introduces three new elements to the mobility organisation, which bring several governance implications. The socio-technical constellation is changing as new roles, tasks and responsibilities emerge, making the ecosystem severely complex. Collaboration between the actors is therefore of significant importance. This collaboration will however not emerge by itself. Next to this, data is the most valuable commodity in MaaS for both private and public actors. There is, however, a data asymmetry whereby the private actors possess the data but are unwilling to share this with public actors. Finally, MaaS changes the spatial arrangements since the physical infrastructures and the public space are inextricably connected to MaaS. Currently, however, MaaS and the spatial environment do not correspond, and a spatial mismatch exists. Additionally, there is an implication concerning legislation. The mobility organisation is currently namely compartmentalised, meaning that mobility cannot be approached integrally, which inhibits the development of MaaS.

These new elements and their related implications, therefore, require a change in governance. In the Netherlands, a public-private governance model is applied, in which public and private actors jointly develop MaaS, wherein all actors have their own tasks and responsibilities. In the initial development phase, a heavier role is temporarily foreseen for the municipality of Amsterdam. By being more present at the start, the government can, as a facilitator, use its instruments to create the right circumstances for MaaS to develop by adapting current policies, drawing up frameworks for collaboration, making certain rules and agreements in concessions and permits, and creating digital infrastructures and promoting data sharing. In this way, the municipality can stimulate the development of MaaS and establish an open, healthy and transparent ecosystem and protect the social goals and public values."
Technical and economic demand response potential analysis of low-carbon nitrogenous fertilizer plants in 2030,"['Alkemade, Felix']","['Crijns-Graus, Wina']",2022-11-01T01:01:29Z,EN,"['Demand response; Fertilizer industry, Flexibility, Linear problem, Optimization']",Sustainable Development,"Global fertilizer production accounts for 2 – 3% of the total energy consumption of which nitrogenous fertilizer is the vast majority. With natural gas as the dominant source of energy, the fertilizer industry is considered one of the largest greenhouse gas emitting industries. Nowadays, global energy markets are disrupted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Thus, reducing natural gas consumption in industries has become of great importance to decrease the EU’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels in combination with tackling the climate crisis. In this study, we examine the demand response potential of a European low carbon fertilizer production facility in 2030 by applying a cost minimization linear programming model. First, a consumption and production profile of a fictive European fertilizer plant is estimated based on the current profiles of OCI Nitrogen’s and Yara Sluiskil’s fertilizer production facilities. Second, the impact on the energy consumption is determined for three decarbonization pathways: Business-as-usual scenario (BAU), Carbon capture and storage scenario (CCS), and a fully electrified Green Ammonia scenario. Third, the technical and economic demand response potentials are estimated through a linear optimization programming model. In the BAU scenario, a fertilizer production facility is expected to consume 34.2 PJ natural gas and 124.5 GWh electricity per year. A CCS system significantly increases the electricity consumption by more than a three-fold, but this is still only a relative energy increase of 3% while 96% of the CO2 emissions are now captured and stored. In the Green Ammonia Scenario, the total energy requirement increases by approximately 15%. The analysis on future trends of natural gas and carbon permits reports threshold values that show when the Green Ammonia production route is lower in total energy costs compared the BAU and CCS scenario. Concerning the demand response potential, the overall energy cost reduction in the BAU and CCS scenario was close to zero since the share of electricity consumed lower than 3%. Solving the optimization model for the Green Ammonia scenario showed that an economic demand response potential of 3.6% could be achieved with a 16.6% peak shifting potential annually. In this research, the electrolyzer is dimensioned 10% larger than required with an installed capacity of 1.3 GW. The technical and economic demand response potential could potentially be maximized by oversizing the electrolyzer up to a point where the demand response potential is still more profitable than the additional investment and operational costs."
Seeding a new future? The role of the state in agroecological transitions,"['Costa de Souza, Carol']","['Feola, Giuseppe']",2022-11-01T01:01:23Z,EN,['Agroecology; ecofeminism; political economy; role of the state; agroecological sustainability transitions'],Sustainable Development,"The negative impacts of modern industrial agriculture are widely recognized in academic literature, supported by growing calls for systemic change. It has become clear to rural citizens and social movements that public policies designed to foster the Green Revolution model have subjected them to external technological and monetary dependency while degrading the environment and human health. Therefore, calls for an agroecological transition have now spread among scientists, international organizations and the broader civil society.
Sustainability transitions (ST) is a field of research dedicated to studying how fundamental systemic changes in societal regimes come about. Scholars have increased efforts to study agroecological transitions in the past years. One central actor in the constellation of actors in society is the state. ST literature is adamant in positing that its active participation is required for sustainability transitions while acknowledging the capitalist state as part and supportive of the incumbent, unsustainable food regime. Therefore, it is unclear what role states actually play or can play in sustainable transitions, suggesting a relevant knowledge gap in the literature. This research, thus, responded to calls for more research on the state's role by bringing a novel theoretical perspective to ST scholarship – ecofeminism. This study developed an analytical framework originally combining ST and ecofeminism to investigate the state's role in agroecological transitions.
As a case study, it applied the framework to the recent experience of a state-supported agroecological transition in Brazil between 2012-2019. The results showed that the federal government created an institutional framing that fostered deep cooperation between state actors and civil society, allowing innovations to emerge autonomously from the protagonists of agroecological practices. In addition, the case study highlighted a less-explored aspect in the literature on agroecological transition: the importance of the types of markets the state is fostering, which should be compatible with the agroecological premise of transforming food systems and relations between producers and consumers. The addition of ecofeminist lenses to ST literature was vital for unveiling the importance of which types of markets are being nurtured.
However, the same institutional setting deemed appropriate to foster the agroecological transition proved highly fragile, supported only by government policies and not rooted in deeper state policies. Therefore, this case study has shown that states can play critical roles in helping but also hindering transformations if these transitions are not ingrained enough in deeper state institutions."
The Transparency/Opacity Conundrum: Locating Dutch Deportation Regimes at Schiphol Detention Center,"['Ahmad, Rabeea']","['Mascat, Jamila']",2022-11-01T01:01:36Z,EN,['immigration detention; Schiphol Airport; self-representation; migration; scavenger methodology'],GEMMA: Master degree in Women's and Gender studies,"Airports are often regarded as sites of transition, and thus devoid of meaning. This view obscures various articulations of power and exclusionary practices involved in border and migration management. I posit that one very vital site that exist in this obscurity is Schiphol airport’s immigration detention center. On facing several blocks in communication and inaccessibility of information I give a reflexive account of employing the feminist ethic of ‘sticking with’ failure, marking this as a feature of the site of inquiry. Using scavenger methodology (Halberstam 1998), I read visual, digital, autoethnographic and interview content for Dutch self-representative narratives that inform contemporary organization of power. Utilizing the notion of white innocence (Wekker 2016), I argue that these representations are premised on migrant exclusion which is bolstered by a cultural denial of histories of racism and colonization. I consider the implications of excluding the presence of a detention center in Schiphol airport’s self-representation and trace my search for the Schipholbrand monument as a haunting reminder of the history of immigration detention at the airport. Through the informational video by the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Defence, Immigration detention in the Netherlands (2019) I observe that there are visual contradictions in the self-representative portrayals of logical objectivity and legality. The absenting of the centrality of airports, or what I call the transparency/opacity conundrum, made evident through the process of asylum at Schiphol cloaks the deportation regimes that inform immigration detention and deportation in the Netherlands."
‘Building a bridge between the Climate Agreement and actual energy savings in the Dutch retail sector’,"['Jonker, Hanna']","['Harmsen, Robert']",2022-11-01T01:01:32Z,EN,['Energy consumption; retail sector; decomposition analysis; driver and barrier analysis'],Energy Science,"Becoming climate neutral by 2050 is the overarching target for the Dutch service sector. However,
there is little insight in current energy usage patterns and opportunities for energy savings in the
sector. Therefore, a quantitative and qualitative analysis in the retail sub-sectors, supermarkets and
non-food shops was performed. The results of the trend analysis between 2010 and 2019 indicate a
significant decrease in final energy consumption for non-food shops (-26%), and a marginal decrease
for supermarkets (-5%). The driving forces of these changes were quantified with a decomposition
analysis. The decrease in energy intensity was the largest contributor for both sub-sectors, with the
chilly winter of 2010 compared to 2019 being the second largest driver. Floor area increased in both
sectors, but more so in the supermarket sub-sector. The change in energy intensity was broken down
in energy applications. As for supermarkets the decrease was driven foremost by product cooling and
space heating. For non-food shops, the strongest drivers were the decrease in indoor lighting and
space heating. Based on expert interviews, the perceived drivers and barriers to energy savings were
analysed. Corporate responsibility and economic incentives are drivers for supermarkets. As for large
non-food shops, the policy ‘Recognized Energy Efficiency Measures List (EML)’ is a driver. The recent
increase in energy prices is another driver for both small and large non-food shops. One perceived
barrier is the split incentive, which is induced by half of the shops being rented. Furthermore, the
required investment capital is an economic barrier. Knowledge and technical barriers, like the lack of
technical employees are also perceived. This study concludes with proposed strategies for energy
savings in the retail sector, such as the implementation of a pilot project to quantify energy savings, as 
well as improved collaboration and knowledge sharing in the non-food sub-sector. Additionally, the 
long-term national energy intensity target needs to be specified in the service sector and its sub-
sectors, to provide guidelines along the pathway towards climate neutrality."

Type inference for Python is hard due to the extensive use of external libraries and the dynamic language features. In this thesis we propose an object-sensitive type analysis for Python based on an extension of the notion of monotone frameworks to deal with dynamic flow manipulation. In addition, we also implement a type parser to partially support retrieving types from Python stub files.

How realistic is my synthetic data? A qualitative approach.,"['Tzikas, Rigas']","['Qahtan, Hakim']",2022-11-01T01:01:41Z,EN,[],Applied Data Science,"Missing values represent one of the most common challenges for data analytics tasks.
For that reason, a lot of techniques have been proposed to fill the missing values
through what is called ”Data Imputation”. Recent studies on generating synthetic
data demonstrate that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used to effectively
solve this problem as follows: for each example in the original data generate
a synthetic example that keeps the existing values. The generated example should
contain values for the features with missing values. However, to confirm if GANs can
provide significant improvements over traditional data imputation techniques, we need
a technique to measure the quality of the generated examples. The quality of the generated
example can be measured by determining how realistic the synthetic data is
compared to the original examples. In this project, we develop a tool for successfully
measuring the quality of the synthetic data. We compare the quality of the generated

Mental health levels between Dutch men and women during Covid-19,"['Velde, Jorwin van der']","['Weinberg, D.W.']",2022-11-15T00:00:34Z,EN,[],Social Policy and Public Health,"Introduction Societal concern about the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms (ADS) has been heightened by the unexpected arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic. Early in the pandemic, research in the Netherlands has shown no significant increase in ADS levels in the general population compared to before the outbreak of the Covid-19 virus. Several questions remain. What is the picture one-and-a-half year after the pandemic began? Furthermore, gender differences in ADS before the pandemic were substantial, with women showing higher levels of ADS. However, little is known about whether gender differences have changed since the pandemic began. Methods I measured ADS with the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) in an adult sample from the Netherlands (n = 3.870) across three annually-spaced time points (late 2019 (T1), late 2020 (T2), and late 2021 (T3)). In line with the MHI-5, a scale was made with scores ranging from 0 (low ADS) to 100 (high ADS). A paired samples t-test investigated the change in ADS over time. A repeated measures ANOVA tested the change in ADS gender differences. Results The results indicated a small but significant decrease in ADS between T1 and T2 and between T1 and T3 (M2019 = 24.68, M2020 = 24.20, M2021 = 24.18). The existing ADS gender gap, with women generally experiencing more ADS than men (Mwomen2019 = 26.57, Mmen2019 = 22.58), did not significantly change during the pandemic (F (1, 3868) = .03, p = .857, partial η2 = <.001). Discussion ADS in the general population decreased significantly compared to late 2019. No increasing ADS gender differences were found. This study suggests that more extensive research is needed on mechanisms that may influence ADS trends, such as the impact of positive side effects during the Covid-19 pandemic."

access to greenspaces. This serves as a problem when there is increasing research stating that
natural environments, like greenspaces, highly benefit a person’s mental wellbeing. This research
examines how proximity to greenspace during adolescence affects the mental health of young
adults. Moreover, we will be studying how socioeconomic status (SES) acts as a moderator for
mental health as the individual moves from their family SES at age 11 to their own SES at age 17
or 20. We found that more exposure to green vegetation is important to the mental well-being of
individuals. There was no moderating factor between childhood greenspace exposure and young
adult mental health across any level of SES–both parental and adolescence SES. Regardless of
the results from this analysis, greenspace still remains important to the well-being of individuals,

This shift also entails increasing secondhand consumption. This current study investigates the values underlying secondhand consumption. Earlier studies have shown contrasting effects. On the one hand, Value-Belief-Norm theory has shown that altruistic and biospheric values lead to more pro-environmental behavior whereas egoistic and hedonistic values lead to less pro-environmental behavior. On the other hand, literature on secondhand consumption has demonstrated that financial, hedonism, and ethical motivations lead to more engagement. In this study, it will be tested whether, besides altruistic and egoistic values, especially biospheric and hedonistic values lead to more SHC since they most closely match the motivations for SHC. Moreover, as lower socioeconomic positions have long been associated with secondhand consumption, the role of an individual’s socioeconomic position will also be studied, hypothesizing that the relationships between values and SHC are likely stronger for individuals with a high socioeconomic position since low SEP individuals want to distance themselves from the stigma around SHC which likely leads to less SHC. A quantitative study was done with the use of data from the LISS Panel in the Netherlands. While not all hypotheses were fully supported by the data, the results did show that the relationship between altruistic values and secondhand consumption is stronger for high socioeconomic position individuals. This study contributes to the field of pro-environmental behavior studies by showing that, in line with Value-Belief-Norm Theory, self-transcending values lead to more secondhand consumption and self-enhancing values lead to less secondhand consumption. However, the strength of these relationships is not exactly the same for those in low socioeconomic positions and those in high socioeconomic positions."

Using an agent-based model we research if policies that reduce the m2 per person counter the effects of the housing crisis. Using this model we conclude that this is not necessarily true. It seems that reducing the m2 per person is not the most important factor in countering the housing crisis. We believe that it is more important to create extra houses.

Embracing approaches through the eyes of Karen Barad’s theory of Agential Realism as a core concept to analyse genders mutual constitution with multiplicities of inter- and intra-acting digital systems and networks, the work considers the constraints this has upon digital gender identity, examining the boundaries and roles of digital platforms and profiles, and highlighting occurrences of programmatic discriminations and data violences.

divorce have an increased risk for various longer term adjustment problems. However, the 
functioning of children after divorce in the shorter term, such as divorce-specific coping, has 
received much less attention. Divorce-specific coping – such as self-blame and acceptance – is 
important to examine as it relates to children’s everyday difficulties after divorce, is predictive of 
their long-term adjustment, and is often targeted in intervention programs aimed at divorced 
families. Aim: Based on a family systems perspective, we investigated the associations between 
different family subsystems, namely the quality of coparenting and sibling relationship quality 
after divorce, and children’s divorce-specific coping. Method: Dutch children (N = 135; Mage = 
11.76) completed questionnaires to examine the associations of coparenting quality (CBQ) and 
sibling relationship quality (NRI) with self-blame and acceptance (PFAD). Multilevel structural 
equation modelling in Mplus was performed to investigate the proposed associations, and to 
examine the sibling relationship quality as a potential mediator in the association between 
coparenting and divorce-specific coping (i.e., acceptance and self-blame). Results: The 
association of neither coparenting nor sibling relationship quality with self-blame or acceptance 
was significant. Moreover, there was no mediation effect of sibling relationship quality. 
Conclusion: Previous research has shown the importance of divorce-specific coping on 
children’s longer term adjustment, but studies on its predictors is lacking. In the current study, 
coparenting quality and sibling relationship quality did not seem to be associated with 
acceptance or self-blame after divorce. Further research is needed, specifically on short-term 
processes in families after divorce and on child characteristics to identify factors that influence 
divorce-specific coping."
The regional transition to a circular economy: Insight into assessing the transition process to a circular economy at the regional level in the Netherlands,"['Bommel, Pieter van']","['Rosales Carreon, Jesus']",2022-11-24T01:01:13Z,EN,['Circular Economy; Transition; Transition Indicators; Regional;'],Sustainable Development,"The concept of a circular has gained increasing attention as a means to address high consumption levels, material scarcity and unequal access to natural resources. This shift from a linear to a circular economy is a complex transition. Understanding and steering this transition requires insight into the transition process. This research aims to contribute to this understanding by providing insight into assessing the CE transition process at the regional level in the Netherlands. 
The first part of this research analysing the suitability of several CE indicator frameworks for assessing the CE transition at the regional level and classifying them using the policy evaluation tool used by the Dutch government to guide the CE transition process. It was found that in the formative phase, which is the early stage of the transition, the use of a transition indicator framework can be most suitable to assess the transition process. This resulted in the choice of one transition indicator framework, the mission-oriented innovation framework (MIS). In this framework, several functions are proposed that are identified as boundary conditions in the transition process. These functions are measured in the second part of the research where the framework is applied to a regional case study. 
In the second part, the mission-oriented innovation framework is applied to the Food Valley region in the Netherlands. This was achieved by structured interviews of thirteen stakeholders within the region. The results give a in depth insight into the local circular ecosystem by identifying the weaknesses, strengths, and possible improvement related to each function. Furthermore, several interactions between functions were observed, supporting the dynamic system of functions. The framework provided a systematic overview of the state of the circular ecosystem and the role of different stakeholders within the Food Valley Region. 
The research shows that using a transition framework can contribute to the assessment of the CE transition at the regional level, especially in the early phase of the transition. However, the use of a transition framework is no silver bullet and should be considered in the context of the transition phase because it doesn’t take into account the outcomes of the transition. Overall, more research is needed to further develop transition frameworks as well as transition dynamics to better understand the transition process and help steering the transition in the right direction."

Exposure to war-related trauma, together with one’s children, can put increased pressure on parenting, making parents doubt their ability to successfully provide safety for their children, which could, in turn relate to lower levels of post-traumatic growth. This study examined whether the relation between post-traumatic stress symptoms and post-traumatic growth can be explained by parental self-efficacy. It was hypothesised that post-traumatic stress symptoms could foster post-traumatic growth by developing new assumptions and skills to cope with the traumatic experience. This link was expected to be explained by lower parental self-efficacy, undermining parents’ personal strength. Using a cross-sectional research design, data from different surveys were collected between 2014 and 2019 from 73 Syrian war refugee parents of adolescents aged 10-15 in the Netherlands (Mage = 40.95, SDage = 6.26). Data were analysed using the Hayes SPSS process method. Results showed that post-traumatic stress symptoms were not related to post-traumatic growth and that parental self-efficacy was not related to post-traumatic growth. Post-traumatic stress symptoms were related to lower parental self-efficacy, as expected. Findings suggest that parental self-efficacy should be improved in interventions for war refugee parents. It is recommended that future research focuses on longitudinal studies to capture the development of post-traumatic growth."

Both freedoms call for a different justification and different limits. If we fail to do this, we will harm our social and cultural life and endanger democracy. O’Neill, therefore, argues for three duties for the press to prevent harm to society and to care for democracy. I think O’Neill is right in claiming this as these duties are necessary to protect these domains, but I will continue this thesis by arguing that these duties are not sufficient. I end this thesis by defending one more duty which I derived from the work of Margaret Kohn."

They found a structure in the graph that could be colored relatively easily called a maximal bushy forest, which we modify to limit the number of relatively difficult-to-color vertices by dividing the vertices in the graph using their relation to the bushy forest. Furthermore, we take a look at how a small vertex cover can be used to quickly find a k-coloring of a graph. Finally, we contribute new lower bounds for maximal induced k-colorable subgraphs, discuss the properties of these graphs and the upper bound on the number of maximal induced k-colorable subgraphs on graphs with these properties."

Extensive studies are still necessary to understand the carcinogenesis of these tumors, especially concerning the role of non-coding mutations. It was reported that about 80% of the non-coding region in the human genome has biochemical functions. This means that including the non-coding region in childhood cancer driver discovery may help in revealing novel oncogenesis mechanisms. However, finding cancer drivers in this region is difficult due to incomplete annotations and inconsistent mutation rates. Because of this, different driver discovery methods with varying assumptions might not perform equally well in all sections of the non-coding region. To combine the strengths of individual methods, a combination of 3 programs was used to find potential cancer drivers in the non-coding region. DriverPower identified candidate non-coding cancer drivers by modeling global background mutation rates. OncodriveCLUSTL performed local permutations to find mutations that cluster together in a genomic element. Lastly, OncodriveFML searched for mutated regulatory elements with higher-than-expected average functional impact scores. The p-values produced by the 3 programs were combined with Brown’s method. After p-values combination and manual curation, a list of 148 probable non-coding drivers was created. Some of these candidates were observed to be associated with alterations in gene expression. However, the conditions in which gene expression could be altered by the probable non-coding cancer drivers may vary. A single mutation that affected a critical region in the TERT promoter could elevate TERT expression. While in the PGAM1 promoter, interactions between SNVs in this region seemed to be important in altering PGAM1 expression. Lastly, identical SNVs in the B3GALT2 promoter were observed to be associated with varying expression levels in different cancer supergroups. This might imply the importance of interaction between underlying transcription control and the candidate non-coding drivers. These observations and the list of candidate non-coding drivers may serve as guides to find targets for further study to understand non-coding drivers in childhood cancer. Understanding the involvement of non-coding cancer drivers in deregulation of gene expression may provide insights into the progression of childhood cancer."
The pressure to press send: Implications of organizational and self-imposed norms on workplace telepressure,"['Heetvelt, Niels']","['Brenninkmeijer, Veerle']",2022-11-29T01:00:42Z,EN,['Workplace telepressure;  Big Five personality traits; irrational need for\ncontrol; response expectation norms; self-imposed norms'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","In response to technological developments, asynchronous modes of communication
have become ubiquitous for exchanging information and maintaining social
relationships in contemporary work environments. While these developments benefit
workers’ job control and diminish work-home conflicts, they could simultaneously
arouse workers’ preoccupation with and urge to repond promptly to work-related ICT
messages, which is labeled as ‘workplace telepressure’. Workplace telepressure could
lead to detrimental health and wellbeing effects, and could be induced by external
norms to respond promptly, imposed by the organizational environment, or by selfimposed norms to respond promptly, imposed by workers’ own predilection and urges.
In pursuit of previous workplace telepressure research, this study was set out with the
aim to examine how trait-like individual differences (e.g. agreeableness,
conscientiousness, neuroticism and irrational need for control) affect workplace
telepressure, as they could act as substantial self-imposed norms. Furthermore, this
study aims to explore whether the presence of response expectation organizational
norms could strengthen the effect of self-imposed norms on workplace telepressure.
By means of cross-sectional research, data were collected among Dutch working adults
(N = 136). Results suggest that both organizational factors as certain personal factors
could contribute to explain workplace telepressure. However, these two factors seem
not in any way to interact with each other. Suggestions for further research and

Visual scanning training (VST) is the most frequently used treatment for VSN in clinical practice. However, not all VSN patients seem to benefit from VST. Therefore, the overarching aim of the current study was to gain insight into factors that influenced VSN symptoms over time during a VST trajectory. To investigate the overall aim, three subgoals were established. The first subgoal of the study was to explore participant characteristics influencing VST outcome. The second subgoal was to investigate performance on static compared to dynamic tests. The third subgoal was to investigate VSN symptoms over time. VSN symptoms were measured at baseline (T0), after the ninth training session (T1), and at one week (T2) and three-month follow-up (T3). Both static (i.e. Star cancellation, Line Bisection test) and dynamic (i.e. Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS), Computerized Visual Detection Task (CVDT)) tests were used to measure VSN symptoms. 18 chronic stroke patients participated in the study. Participants performed a six-week VST, three times a week, 40 minutes per session. Group, educational level, months since stroke, and time did not predict VST outcome. Higher age and better MoCA performance were related to better VST outcomes. No difference was found between performance on static compared to dynamic tests. VST symptoms did not change significantly over time. Results of the study should be taken into account with caution due to a lack of generalizability of the sample. Further research is necessary before the application of the current findings into clinical practice."

the present day. The collection of the empirical data is organized around the Bunsichari
project, a trauma-informed peacebuilding project of Dunna Corpóracion taking place within
the municipalities of Fusagasugá and Venecia. This is analyzed through trauma-informed and
conflict transformation literature, departing from individual trauma to how trauma is embodied
on the collective level. Herewith, the collective body exhibits trauma-related symptoms such
as avoidance of the past, hypervigilance, tactile as a heavy layer of constantly present
collective fear, covering the underlying frail social processes. Unhealed collective trauma
appears to be sustained and incited by abundant ongoing structural problems, thereby
encapsulating the massive reservoir of collective trauma of Colombia and forming a breeding
ground for repeated cycles of conflict. Subsequent to the inquiry on collective trauma, this
research delves into the process of healing the collective trauma within peacebuilding
practices. It articulates the importance of suitable spaces in which people can genuinely listen

Investigating the role of FOSL1/FRA1 in BRAF-V600E patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids,"['Deenichina, Polina']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-11-26T01:00:50Z,EN,[],Regenerative Medicine and Technology,"Summary: 

Cells are the building blocks of all life and different types of cells combine to make up tissues and organs. Epithelial cells line the inside of the large intestine that includes the colon and the rectum. Each cell is programmed by a genetic code that gives instructions on every decision that the cell has to make, including division, growth, movement and death. These cellular processes are accomplished by genes that are being expressed according to the genetic code. When genes are expressed, proteins are produced that make up different parts of cells. The cells divide to give rise to new cells with the same characteristics as the mother cell. If there is a mistake in the genetic code also called a mutation, the cells could divide uncontrollably resulting in a massive formation referred to as a tumour. If the cells within the tumour accumulate more mutations, this could lead to some cells detaching and migrating to a different tissue in the body to form more tumours called metastases. Forming tumours and developing metastasis are part of the cancer disease, and cancer with metastases is called metastatic. The originating tissue of cancer gives it its name. When the cancer develops from the epithelium of the colon or rectum, it is referred to as colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC can be classified by specific mutations that often co-occur together. An aggressive and deadly type of metastatic CRC is highly associated with a mutation in the BRAF gene, that is abbreviated V600E, that forms a mutant BRAF protein. The V600E mutation is correlated with other genes, namely FOSL1. FOSL1 is known to be dysregulated in metastatic cancers, but the mechanism is poorly understood. The aim of this report is to understand how FOSL1 and its gene product called FRA1 are involved in metastatic CRC that has the V600E mutation in the BRAF gene. To address this aim we used small 3D spherical models of cancer that are referred to as organoids. The organoids were generated from patient-derived colorectal tumours positive for the BRAF-V600E mutation. The BRAF-V600E cancerous organoids were used in this study along with organoids that were corrected for the V600E mutation and produced a normal BRAF protein. We used anti-cancer drugs called chemotherapy to block the mutated BRAF protein and identified that FRA1 was also blocked. We mimicked the metastatic process and found out that the BRAF-V600E mutation causes the spherical organoids to change shape and to form sprouts protruding from the spheres. The shape of cells and organoids is called morphology. The sprouting morphology was reversed to spherical or normal when BRAF was blocked with chemotherapy. From that we concluded that the V600E mutation causes the change in shape possibly in combination with FRA1. We performed further experiments to understand how FRA1 interacts with other genes involved in metastasis, but we did not find a connection."

Regulatory reliance pathways during health emergencies: Enabling timely authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines in Latin America.,"['Zee, Ivar van der']","['Mantel-Teeuwisse, A.K.']",2022-12-01T00:00:31Z,EN,['regulatory Affairs; COVID-19; reliance; priority; Latin-America; market authorization; global Health; drug approval; medicines regulation; review times; abridged review; LMIC; emerging markets'],Drug Innovation,"Abstract 1:
Background: Latin American countries had to rapidly authorize COVID-19 vaccines in response to the pandemic. A common mechanism for NRAs to expedite authorizations is through relying on trusted NRAs from other jurisdictions (i.e., regulatory reliance). The use of reliance within vaccine authorizations is not known. Therefore, this study mapped the timing and nature of regulatory (reliance) pathways used to authorize COVID-19 vaccines in Latin America.

Methods: An observational study was conducted assessing the characteristics of all COVID-19 vaccine authorizations in Latin America. For every authorization it was determined whether reliance was used in the authorization process. Subgroups of reference NRAs and non-reference NRAs were compared. 

Results: 56 authorizations of 10 different COVID-19 vaccines were identified in 18 countries, of which 25 (45%) used reliance and 12 (21%) authorizations did not, for the remaining 19 (34%) it was not possible to determine whether reliance was used. Reference agencies used reliance less often (40% of authorizations with a known pathway) compared to non-reference agencies (100%). The median review time was just 15 days and does not meaningfully differ between reliance and non-reliance authorizations.

Conclusions: This study demonstrated that reliance pathways can provide rapid authorizations in response to emergencies like COVID-19. Yet, independent authorization review times were not considerably longer. Thus, despite reliance pathways being associated with numerous rapid authorizations, they are not a prerequisite. 


Abstract 2:
Background: Regulatory reliance is seen as an efficient means to tackle the increasing workloads faced by National Regulatory Agencies (NRAs). However, a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of practicing reliance does not exist. This study lays the groundwork for “relianomics”: the systematic assessment of reliance impacts.

Methods: A systemic literature search through PubMed was used to identify articles mentioning (potential) impacts of practicing reliance. 
Articles mention (potential) impacts of reliance identified through PubMed and publications by global health and trade organizations were used to form a collection of 27 relevant documents. From these, the impacts of reliance and the metrics to measure them were extracted and categorized. 

Results: The analyzed documents contained 24 (potential) impacts of reliance mentioned 110 times in total and 5 related metrics. Impacts were categorized into public health, economic, and internal NRA impacts. Impacts include improved NRA efficiency, enhanced NRA capabilities, unintended secondary reliance, improved access to medicine, higher quality regulatory action, risk of inheriting flawed approvals, increased collaboration, and pharmaceutical market growth. 5 of 27 documents contained empirical evidence relating to reliance.

Discussion: The Relianomics framework was informed by a comprehensive list of reported impacts and likely includes the most consequential impacts of reliance. However, empirical evidence was scarce, which emphasizes the need for a systematic approach to assessing the return-on-investment of reliance."
Voluntary business-to-government data sharing: exploring actor alignment to create mutual benefits,"['Sleen, Tom van der']","['Susha, Iryna']",2022-11-30T01:00:51Z,EN,[],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Over the past decade, the availability of data has significantly increased as a result of the ‘datafication’ of society. Simultaneously, public and private organisations are undergoing increasing pressures to address societal challenges. As a result, data collaboratives recently gained more attention in the literature on public-private data sharing. Data collaboratives are public-private data sharing partnerships that address societal challenges. They are often challenging due to diverging interests of public and private organisations and tend to be one-off in practice. Furthermore, the benefits for government organisations are often clear, whereas the benefits for private organisations are not. Academic literature recognises the need to balance these interests and create win-win situations. However, limited knowledge is available on how this can be realised within a business-to-government (B2G) data sharing context. This research aimed to explore how voluntary B2G data sharing partnerships to address societal challenges can be mutually beneficial and can become more sustainable over a longer period of time. The framework for voluntary B2G data sharing by Rukanova et al. (2020) was used as a starting point of this study. This framework provided a basic view of how the interests of public and private organisations can be aligned to create mutual benefits, but lacked in-depth insights. Therefore, this study proposes an adapted version in which the organisational interests of public and private organisations, alignment mechanisms, and the creation of benefits are further specified. This study was designed as a single case study with embedded subcases. The Dutch national statistical office, CBS, was studied as the main case due to its prior history of collaboration with private organisations. Two voluntary B2G data sharing partnerships between CBS and private organisations were studied as subcases. Data was collected by means of interviews with CBS and its private partners. The empirical findings of this study suggest that voluntary B2G data sharing can be mutually beneficial through the alignment of interests. Here, urgency was identified as a main mechanism to find common ground in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. As there is an increasing urgency regarding sustainability topics, it is not unthinkable that the willingness of private organisations to share data will increase as well. Value renewal is considered to be important to create a more sustainable partnership over a longer period of time. Further research is necessary to gain a better understanding of how interests are aligned and mutual benefit is created in other contexts."
Patient’s Perspective on Influencing Factors on Goal Fulfilment in Treatment of Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders: A Thematic and Text Mining Study,"['Vuijk, Marijn']","['Gerritsen, L.']",2022-11-30T01:00:48Z,EN,[],Clinical Psychology,"Background: Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders (SSRD) have a negative influence on
the quality of life. The preferred treatment, cognitive behavioural therapy, is limited in
achieving symptom reduction. Understand influencing factors on treatment goal fulfilment
can improve treatment.
Objective: This study aims to contribute a comprehensive overview of influencing factors
from the perspective of patients. Goal fulfilment literature is evaluated and the clinicians’
perspective is compared. In clinical application, these factors can support shared decision making,
optimise customised treatment and ultimately increase treatment effects for patients
with SSRD.
Method: Following Delphi procedure, 154 individual influencing factors are provided by
patients (N = 12) and a card sorting task is fulfilled by patients (N = 2). Thematic analysis is
applied on the sorted categories. Text mining analysis triangulates the method, selecting
keywords from the statements.
Results: Thirteen categories are specified in the card sorting task, sorted further into four
themes: The treatment, therapist, social context and the client’s situation. Through text
mining twelve regularly recurring words emerged, highlighting three keywords: health care,
environment and therapist (frequency ≥ 14).
Conclusion: The findings point out different areas to be cautious of during treatment. The
findings comply goal striving theory. Multiple differences are brought to light with the
clinicians’ perspective such as more awareness of the practical side of treatment and a nuance
in the responsibility for treatment goal achievement. The constructed overview can form a
base for further research to improve SSRD treatment."

asthma is a prominent allergic disease. In asthmatic patients, the immune system acts hyper sensitive 
upon encounter with an allergen such as house dust mite (HDM). As a result, patients with asthma 
suffer from coughing, sneezing and chest tightness, resulting in a depleted life quality. This 
substantiates the high need for research to the fundamentals of asthma and potential preventative 
methods. 
Over the past decades, a correlation has been shown between breast feeding and the 
development of asthma. The human milk components human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) have been 
suggested as potential preventative players against asthma. However, the underlying mechanisms of 
HMOS on asthma prevention are yet to be elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore 
the potential preventative effect of systemic HMO1 and HMO2 on airway epithelium upon HDM 
exposure. First, an HDM titration was performed on Calu-3 cells. Subsequently, Calu-3 cells were 
incubated with HMO1 or HMO2, and exposed to HDM. Also, an in vivo experiment was performed with
BALB/c mice fed a diet containing HMO1 or HMO2 and sensitised to HDM. 
It was insignificantly determined that ALI conditions exposed to HDM after 24 hours exerted 
representative circumstances in vitro. This suggests that ALI can be applied as a model to mimic the 
lung in vitro and that HDM exerts its effect on the lungs within 24 hours. Additionally, the conditions 
incubated with HMO1 and HMO2 potentially showed a protective trend over the lung epithelial cells 
that were exposed to HDM reflected by the TEER in vitro. These results advocate for a potential 
protective mechanism of HMO1 and HMO2 on the lung epithelial cells when they are exposed to HDM, 
though repetition of the experiment is needed. In vivo mice exposed to HDM significantly depicted 
high fractions of activated DCs compared to Sham mice, but lower fractions of CD86+ expressing DCs, 
without a significant effect of HMO1 or HMO2. This suggests that DCs are activated by HDM and 
subsequently migrate to the lymph nodes in order to activate naive T cells."

In addition, the relationship between authority and legitimacy was investigated. Lastly, the interrelationship between perceived coercion to obey sense of control, sense of responsibility and legitimacy were researched. An online experiment has been set up where 121 participants were confronted with authority figures of different rank and were asked to report about their experience. At the end of the experiment, participants scored the authority figures on legitimacy. Results indicated that a higher authority level resulted in a higher perceived coercion to obey, a lower sense of control, and a lower sense of responsibility. Results also revealed that legitimacy was not predicted by authority level. Finally, the results indicated that there are direct links between legitimacy and perceived coercion to obey, between perceived coercion to obey and sense of control and between sense of control and sense of responsibility. This is the first study to show the direct effect of authority level on intrinsic experience.

FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE? – WHY CORONA PROTESTERS KEEP GOING IN RURAL AREAS,"['Schütz, Imke']","['Vis, Barbara']",2022-12-01T01:01:10Z,EN,['COVID-19; protest motivation; rural areas; qualitative methodology; in-depth interviews; corona containment measures'],European Governance,"Research on corona protests has largely focused on protests in capital cities while neglecting rural areas. I argue that this limitation is not only an inappropriate constriction of this phenomenon itself but also underestimates the spread of the protests. Moreover, leaving out rural areas might omit im-portant general motives and underlying issues of the protesters.
This study’s objective was to analyse the personal factors and group characteristics that motivate the rural corona protesters to continue despite little press coverage and political attentions. For this, I carried out a typical case study of the rural village of Ottersberg in Germany. Specifically, I conducted in-depth interviews with protesters at the weekly demonstrations between May 16th and June 13th, 2022.
This study has found that, with respect to personal factors, the perceived violation of individual norms holds greater weight than the perceived violation of group norms. Intrinsic motivation arises from ex-periencing a sense of agency and is of particular importance to the protesters. This drives them to take the group’s goals and convictions into the public, which presents another important factor. Nonethe-less, the protesters only partially believe in the group’s capacity to bring change.
Turning to the group characteristics, overarching vague group values and a sense of shared disad-vantages are key. Further, a sense of belonging to the group is fundamental for participation and the protest’s continuation. It is based on the individual experience of added emotional value from the group, which provides a space for reassurance and protected self-expression.
The findings highlight the Ottersberg protest group's individualistic nature, suggesting another route for groups taking collective action. Additionally, they contribute to a more nuanced understanding of German protests against corona containment measures in understudied rural areas. Finally, these find-ings have direct implications for communication about future health crises, which should concentrate on taking these anxieties and motives into account. This could contribute to lessening political apathy in addition to reconciling a polarised society."
Synthesis of activity-based carbocyclic probes for the specific inhibition and detection of glucuronidases,"['Prestifilippo, Gino']","['Wennekes, Tom']",2022-12-01T01:01:18Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"Glucuronidases are part of the glycosidase enzyme family that cleaves polysaccharide chains in organisms. In humans, exo-acting β-glucuronidase and endo-acting heparanase were identified as the main glucuronidases, though, despite their important function in the body, their disfunction plays a significant role in various diseases, including Sly syndrome, Crohn’s disease and cancer. To design novel drugs to treat these diseases, understanding the role of these enzymes in pathology is crucial. Though structures have been identified that can act as irreversible inhibitors and activity-based probes, the current generation lacks the enzyme specificity required to be utilized as diagnostic tools.

A cyclophellitol derivative with an aziridine warhead, which was previously synthesized and evaluated by Wu et al., showed a higher specificity as a glucuronidase inactivator than its predecessors. A crucial step in its synthesis, the installation of the aziridine ring, is, however, met with poor yields and side-product formation, and requires four individual reaction steps. The goal of this project was to explore an alternative one-step method to install the aziridine warhead utilizing Du Bois’ catalyst and O-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)hydroxylamine (DPH).

Although the final structure could not be synthesized due to time constraints, the work in this thesis shows that the ester located at the C6 position may not need to be reduced whilst generating the cyclophellitol aziridine scaffold. This could potentially allow for a milder, more convenient implementation of the COO- functionality at a later stage. Furthermore, it was shown that BCl3 could be used for an effective debenzylation of the carbocycle intermediate with good yields under mild conditions."

Wanneer AI van invloed is op dat beslisproces en daarmee de manier waarop street-level bureaucrats deze vertaalslag maken, is het van belang om inzicht te verkrijgen in wat deze effecten dan zijn. Zonder inzicht in deze effecten kan het zijn dat kansen onbenut worden gelaten en voorziene en onvoorziene risico’s van AI bewaarheid worden (Bovens & Zouridis, 2002; Bullock, 2019). Daarbij maakt meer kennis over de effecten van AI op het beslisproces en de beslissingen van street-level bureaucrats het mogelijk om te bepalen op welke manier en in welke mate AI-toepassingen gebruikt kunnen én moeten worden. Daarom wordt er in dit onderzoek vanuit een micro- en behavioral public administration perspectief naar het effect van AI op het beslisproces en de beslissingen van street-level bureaucrats gekeken. Daarbij wordt in het specifiek ingegaan op het ontstaan van biases in het beslisproces bij het werken met AI.

Het doel van dit onderzoek is om inzicht te verkrijgen in mogelijke contextfactoren die van invloed zijn op het ontstaan van biases bij gebiedsgebonden politieagenten bij het werken met AI-toepassingen. De onderzoeksvraag die centraal staat is: “Welke contextfactoren zijn van invloed op het optreden van automatiseringsbias en selectieve opvolging bij gebiedsgebonden politieagenten?”. Deze vraag is theoretisch vormgegeven aan de hand van literatuur over de street-level bureaucrat, het effect van AI op deze bureaucrat, biases, en mogelijke contextfactoren bij gedrag en beslisprocessen geïdentificeerd uit bestaande wetenschappelijke literatuur. De contextfactoren zijn onderverdeeld in drie groepen: de beslissing, de beslisser en het beslisproces. De opgedane theoretische inzichten zijn via kwalitatieve vignetteninterviews met politieagenten – vormgegeven als een realistisch mock-up algoritme – empirisch getoetst.

Uit de bevindingen blijkt dat zo wel automatiseringsbias als selectieve opvolging zich bij gebiedsgebonden politieagenten kunnen voordoen. Deze nieuwe – op het eerste gezicht paradoxale – theoretische bevinding kan in ieder geval deels verklaard worden vanuit de bevindingen over de invloed van contextfactoren. Ten eerste blijkt het effect van factoren rondom de beslissing: de mate van complexiteit en onzekerheid met name versterkend voor beide soorten biases. Ten tweede blijkt het effect van factoren rondom de beslisser – wanneer deze in sterkere mate voorkomen – voor automatiseringsbias diffuus of verminderend en voor selectieve opvolging met name versterkend. Tot slot hebben de factoren vanuit de beslissituatie een vrij diffuus effect, waarbij de aanwezigheid van collega’s potentieel een rol kan spelen in het verminderen van beide biases. Het effect van deze verschillende groepen contextfactoren is in dit onderzoek inzichtelijk gemaakt in een tabel. Kortom, de mate van automatiseringsbias en selectieve opvolging wordt beïnvloed door diverse contextfactoren en lijkt dus sterk persoons- situatie- en contextafhankelijk te zijn. De variatie in contextfactoren kan dus inderdaad een verklaring bieden voor het ogenschijnlijk paradoxale feit dat automatiseringsbias en selectieve opvolging beide kunnen optreden. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat het gebruik van AI verschillende soorten effecten heeft op het beslisproces van de street-level bureaucrat, welke in ieder geval deels te verklaren zijn vanuit diverse contextfactoren."
"From Clicks to Bricks Strategy & Consumers’ National Culture
An Empirical Research on the Influence of Customers’ National Culture on the “From Clicks to Bricks” Strategy","['Vesprini, Chiara']","['Dirksen, Erik']",2022-12-01T01:00:49Z,EN,[],International Management,"In recent years, despite the growing success and potential of e-commerce, a counter-trend called
'From Clicks to Bricks' has developed. Numerous online companies have in fact started to open new
physical shops or expand existing ones, implementing their physical presence. This research aims to
provide a clear explanation of the From Clicks to Bricks counter-trend and how it provides a
strategic advantage to online businesses in order to help entrepreneurs and investors make their
decisions. The main contribution to the academic literature is made by analysing the effects of
national customer culture on the effectiveness of the From Clicks to Bricks strategy. To investigate
and achieve these objectives, an online survey was constructed and sent to a wide and varied
audience. The results suggest that the national culture of consumers does not have a direct linear
influence on the effectiveness of the strategy. In fact, it was found that the factors that most
influence the effectiveness of the strategy are the emotions felt by customers during in-store
shopping and the purchasing preferences of consumers. In addition, the results indicate that
demographic attributes are key elements to consider for B2C retail strategies. The implementation
of a physical store in Asia would lead to a conversion of 60% of consumers, who instead of
comparing online offers to search for the cheapest one, would immediately purchase the product.
Finally, for more than 60% of respondents it is important to have the ability to purchase a product
both online and in-store because it enhances their shopping experience."
Impact of vincristine dose reduction on overall survival in patients with DLBCL,"['Zweers, Berber']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-12-01T00:00:39Z,EN,['DLBCL; Vincristine dose reduction; R-CHOP; overal survival'],Geneeskunde,"Introduction: The standard first-line treatment for diffuse large B-cel lymphoma (DLBCL), an aggressive non-hodgkin
lymphoma, is the R-CHOP regimen: a combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and
prednisone. The most common adverse effect of this regime is neurotoxicity caused by vincristine. For this reason
vincristine is frequently reduced or omitted from the therapy.
Methods: In this retrospective cohort study medical records from patients with de novo DLBCL, diagnosed between
2015 and 2021, were reviewed. The objective was to investigate the effect of vincristine dose reduction on overall
survival and progression free survival in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP. Patients were included if they had
completed at least six courses of chemotherapy. Survival status was obtained through the personal records database.
Results: In total 101 patients were included in our analysis. Vincristine was reduced or omitted in 49/101 patients. The overall survival of all patients was high, 88%. Vincristine reduction did not affect progression free survival or overall survival in our cohort. Relative dose intensity <85% produced a hazard ratio of 0.359 (95% confidence interval 0.097-1.325). In univariate analysis only age was associated with poorer survival.
Discussion: Even though our study was potentially underpowered, we did not find a difference in progression free
survival or in overall survival in DLBCL patients with and without reduction of vincristine from the R-CHOP regimen."
The Unimaginable Huisje-Boompje-Beestje: An ethnographic exploration of personhood and family through the lens of Dutch women who do not want to be mothers,"['Durieux, Tara']","['Saraf, A.']",2022-12-01T01:01:02Z,EN,['Family; futures; motherhood; personhood; pronatalism; the Netherlands'],Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship,"This thesis explores the lived experiences of Dutch women who do not want to be mothers, as a means to illuminate possibilities and constraints of personhood and family for women in the Netherlands. Because the women I have spoken to are positioned outside the norm, those who live without children offer insightful perspectives on the norms, values and institutions of Dutch society. Namely, pronatalism normalizes motherhood as intrinsically linked to womanhood and emphasizes the importance of having a biological family on one’s own. Even though the stories reveal the painful consequences and ambiguity surrounding the “choice” to not be a mother, these women also reveal that life can be well-lived as their purpose is greater than body parts, their personhood bigger than their reproductive choice, and belonging is not limited to the family of origin."
Procedural game environment for training player skills,"['Werf, Joël van der']","['Bakkes, S.C.J.']",2022-12-01T01:01:20Z,EN,['Procedural Content Generation; Player modeling; Game literacy;'],Game and Media Technology,"Wanting to learn someone to play a video game is tightly tight to the concept of literacy, which means competence or knowledge in a specified area. In video games, we call this game literacy, which means we want people to increase their skills in playing video games. The common way of teaching a user game literacy is through the use of a tutorial which teaches the player the base mechanics of the game. Tutorials in most situations are created by designers which force players to complete some simple tasks in a certain order that learn them the base mechanics of the game. After completing the tutorial, the player plays through a series of levels, in which slowly the difficulty of the game scales up. The problem with this approach is that we have players of all kinds of different skill levels playing video games. We have to take the different skill levels of players into account. If we do not take the different skill levels of players into account, they might quit the game because of boredom or being too frustrated because of not making any progress in the game. To solve this problem, we propose a method that adaptively changes the generation of game levels based on the player’s performance in the game and tries to target the difficulty of the levels based on the player’s skill in playing video games. Our method focuses on generating game levels with game mechanics the user needs improvement on. Results show that our method is enabled to train people in their game literacy better than a baseline adaptive environment"
Motion corrected abdominal PET/MRI using MR-based motion tracking,"['Meinders, Stan']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-12-01T01:00:55Z,EN,['Motion correction; PET/MRI'],Medical Imaging,"Respiratory and bulk motion in abdominal PET studies lead to blurring of PET reconstructions. As a result, lesion volumes tend to be overestimated, while tracer uptake is underestimated and small lesions become undetectable. Motion correction may be used to correct PET images that would otherwise be blurred by motion. The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using MR-based motion tracking for motion correction on abdominal PET images acquired with PET/MRI. To study this, motion vector fields were generated using the novel MR sequence rCASPR. These vector fields were subsequently applied to simulated PET data acquired with the digital XCAT phantom. Motion correction of the reconstructions was done using the CASToR reconstruction framework complemented with a motion correction method based on deformation vector fields. The influence of only using either respiratory or bulk motion correction was studied on a simulation with both respiratory and bulk motion. The feasibility of using MRbased motion tracking with the rCASPR technique for motion correction of PET simulations was shown. Higher CRC values, CNR values and maximum uptake values and lower lesion volumes were found for the reconstruction with full motion correction than for the reconstruction without motion correction. Moreover, the relative impact of bulk motion correction versus respiratory motion correction could be assessed in this PET simulation containing both respiratory and bulk motion."
Using deep learning to predict children’s age and risk of dyslexia from the event related potential,"['Pauwels, Floris']","['Schnack, Hugo']",2022-12-10T01:00:47Z,EN,['EEG; Deep Learning; Age Prediction; Dyslexia; ePodium; DDP; Python; Encoder; ERP Pre-processing for DL; Auditory Oddball;'],Artificial Intelligence,"This thesis uses electroencephalography (EEG) data to predict the age and risk of developmental dyslexia of young children. It is useful to diagnose dyslexia at a young age to conduct interventions that reduce reading and writing difficulties later in life. The ePodium and the Dutch Dyslexia Project (DDP) dataset are used. Both these
datasets use the auditory oddball paradigm to elicit a standard and deviant Event Related Potential (ERP). The EEG data is pre-processed with the autoreject library, which removes many artifacts in the data. The cleaned trials around an auditory event are averaged to create ERPs. These ERPs are used by deep learning models to predict the age and risk of dyslexia from patterns within the data. The results of a previous master thesis affiliated with the ePodium project are reproduced. The thesis trained a deep learning model that found a correlation between age and the standard ERP signals of children in the DDP dataset. Reproducing the results confirms that the encoder model is the state-of-the-art model on age prediction from ERPs. Trained models can already make reasonable age predictions from a small subset of the total standard trials within an experiment. Also, adding a significant amount of Gaussian noise to each ERP signal does not significantly alter the performance of the models. These observations indicate that the models base their predictions on the global pattern of the ERP and not from local voltage differences in the millisecond range. Transfer learning between datasets is possible as models trained on the DDP dataset found a correlation between the ERPs from the standard event and age within the ePodium dataset despite the differences between the two datasets. There was a difference in results between models that used standardised and non-standardised ERPs. The encoder model was unable to find patterns for predicting age and dyslexia from the ePodium dataset. This dataset may be too small for deep learning to make predictions. Some solutions to this problem can be to use more data-efficient methods like timefrequency analysis on raw EEG data or to create simulated data to artificially increase the size of the dataset."
Improving performance management at SkylineDx,"['Kemper, Erik']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-12-09T01:01:22Z,EN,"['Performance management, dashboards, key performance indicators']",Science and Business Management,"Background and objectives
This report describes the case study performed during the business internship at SkylineDx BV. SkylineDx is a mid-sized biotechnology company that develops diagnostic tests, most notably for melanoma and multiple myeloma. The case study aimed to improve performance management at SkylineDx. This was done in two ways: through dashboard development and through the implementation of key performance indicators (KPIs). 
Dashboard development
A dashboard is a performance management tool that can be used at virtually all levels of an organisation. It summarises a company’s or department’s most important metrics on a single screen. Dashboards can be operational, tactical, or strategic. In the current case study, three strategic dashboards were developed for SkylineDx. These included a financial dashboard, a sales dashboard, and an operations dashboard. The development of these dashboard was divided into four phases: requirement selection, metric selection, technology selection, and design. The dashboards were made using Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint, for the back-end and the front-end, respectively.
KPI implementation
KPIs are a type of metric that reflect the performance of a department’s critical success factors; those aspects or processes that must be done well consistently. A good KPI adheres to a number of criteria, of which the most important is arguably its actionability. 
In the current case study, eleven KPIs were implemented at eight locations: human resources, the laboratory, general operations, customer service, IT, bioinformatics, the study team, and product development. Interviews were conducted with relevant personnel to obtain potential KPIs. These were optimised based on literature and input from the quality assurance (QA) department. The KPIs were then discussed with the employees who would be responsible for the KPI. Lastly, the KPIs were integrated into a KPI tracker in Excel. This tracker allowed input of data for the calculation of the KPI, as well as graphs showing the KPI’s value over time.
Recommendations
The dashboard section and the KPI section of this report both end with recommendations. For the dashboards, it is recommended to apply the build-measure-learn concept for further improvement. This enables continuous improvement over a longer period of time, based on experiences from the dashboards’ users. A change of dashboard platform can be considered, which could enable more complex functionalities. These include planning and forecasting, point-and-click interactivity, and automatic updating of the dashboards’ content.
For the KPIs, it is recommended to evaluate the current KPIs after six months on effectiveness and user friendliness. During this evaluation, current KPIs can be improved based on experience and increased adherence to the KPI criteria. Additionally, more KPIs can be implemented. Most departments currently have only one KPI, in line with preferences of the QA department. However, in the future it is recommendable to implement multiple KPIs per department. This enables measuring past performance (lagging KPIs), as well as drivers of future performance (leading KPIs). Lastly, the KPIs could be implemented in departmental dashboards, which show other important metrics and information."
Currents in the Tasman Sea in a changing climate,"['Bogers, Liv']","['Sebille, Erik van']",2022-12-09T01:01:19Z,EN,"['ocean currents, western boundary currents, ocean modelling, Lagrangian analysis, ocean parcels, Tasman Sea, marine heat waves, climate change']",Climate Physics,"Western boundary currents are an important element of the climate system since they control the oceanic meridional heat transport. Climate projections around Australia and New Zealand suggest an increase in volume transport of the Tasman Leakage but a decline for the Tasman Front, which carries water and heat towards New Zealand. Despite this decline, the region around the North Island of New Zealand has been identified as a region with extreme warming and this raises the question of what drives this warming. In this study we investigate climate projections of New Zealand’s Earth System Model to quantify changes to transports of the oceanic currents and possible driver for the warming using low (SSP1-2.6), medium (SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP3-7.0) emission scenarios in combination with Lagrangian particle tracking analyses. 
The direction of change in volume transport agrees with previous studies. Our projections reveal an increase between 16% and 76% in volume transport and a 29% and 122% increase in temperature transport of the Tasman Leakage between the low and high emission scenarios. 
In the Tasman Front, volume transport for SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios decline between 10% and 33%. The temperature transport increases in SSP2 with 4% and decreases with 20% in SSP3. Therefore, a possible driver for the intensifying marine heat waves around the North Island of New Zealand could be the decrease in volume transport that allows for heat accumulation in the region.
The Lagrangian analyses reveal that the temperature along the trajectory is projected to increase in the high emission scenario. At the end of the 20th century only 1% of the volume weighted trajectories towards New Zealand are above 20°C, this increases to 5.5% by the end of the 21st century for the high emission scenario. Despite a decline in the overall Lagrangian temperature transport, the volume weighted fraction of trajectories which encounter higher temperatures from the EAC to the north of NZ increases which possibly widens or opens up a pathway for tropical species towards NZ."
Existence of Riemann surfaces through an equilibrium of a tangent holomorphic vector field,"['Huiszoon, Constant']","['Hanssmann, Heinz']",2022-12-10T00:00:36Z,EN,['holomorphic vector field; equilibrium; singularity; invariant Riemann surface; notation; non-integrability; Grobman-Hartman theorem; Hartman-Grobman theorem'],Mathematical Sciences,"It is shown that every holomorphic vector field that vanishes at a point where its derivative is invertible has a Riemann surface such that the vector field is tangent to the Riemann surface and such that the Riemann surface contains the point. In fact, we give a precise finite lower bound on the number of (germs of) such Riemann surfaces depending on the derivative of the vector field at such a point. We use for this a differentiable version of the Grobman-Hartman theorem. Additionally, we conjecture an upper bound on the number of independent integrals a vector field may have near an equilibrium. In the presentation, a newly developed notional system is used."
Barriers and Facilitators of PrEP uptake among MSM in Europe: a systematic review  and evidence synthesis using the COM-B model,"['Pantoja Solana, Andrea']","['Ditzhuijzen, J.M. van']",2022-12-09T01:01:13Z,EN,['Preexposure prophylaxis; MSM; use; facilitators and barriers; COM-B'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Background. After 6 years since PrEP’s approval in Europe, its uptake among eligible MSM 
continues to be well below the “zero transmission” targets set by the UNAIDS. This study 
gathers the reported motivators and barriers that influence the intention of PrEP use by eligible 
HIV-negative MSM in Europe. The findings are contrasted to the COM-B model, which is the 
core of the Behaviour Change Wheel, a theory widely used to design social interventions. The 
objective is to test the COM-B viability for this social key issue for potential further 
implementation research. Methods. A systematic search through PubMed and Scopus 
databases was conducted to find relevant studies published from 2016 onwards. Thematic 
analysis was used to fit the results into the COM-B model. Results. 191 studies found through 
databases were assessed for eligibility, of which 17 full text were included in the final analysis 
plus three additional studies from grey literature. Most findings could be categorized into the 
COM-B factors (psychological capability, physical capability, physical opportunity, social 
opportunity, reflective motivation, automatic motivation). However, some categories fell 
outside of the COM-B model therefore two additional factors were added (behavioural and 
demographic). Conclusions.The COM-B model is an effective behavioural theory to analyse 
this particular issue and it could be a starting point for further research on how to design theoryinformed interventions, however it is incomplete. Specific behavioural and demographic 
characteristics of different groups within the MSM population should be considered in 
intervention design."
"A cross-level, intersectional feminist perspective of patient empowerment  through mobile health applications: a case study on the app ‘RheumaBuddy’  for rheumatoid arthritis.","['McNaughton, Kate']","['Weinberg, D.W.']",2022-12-09T01:01:10Z,EN,[],Social Policy and Public Health,"The importance of patient empowerment has emerged as a key dimension of contemporary 
healthcare policy and delivery under the paradigm of the democratisation of healthcare. This thesis 
focuses on digital health (DH) interventions, particularly mobile health applications, and their role in 
patient empowerment. The aim of this research was to highlight the importance of a multi-level 
analysis of empowerment through DH, which takes place on micro (intrapersonal), meso 
(interpersonal) and macro (structural) levels. Qualitative research through interviewing was 
conducted alongside Daman, a digital healthcare partner, in relation to their app ’RheumaBuddy’ for 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
This study utilises a multi-level analysis of empowerment under intersectional feminist theory, 
illuminated through a case study on the mobile health app ’RheumaBuddy’. A multi-level analysis is 
imperative when considering empowerment due to issues associated with a single level analysis 
which often forgoes the nuances associated with the true lived patient experience. This affectively 
ties in with an intersectional feminist perspective, which argues that power and identity intertwine 
to impact the oppression of marginalized individuals. Aspects related to power and identity as 
associated with intersectional feminism heavily influence patient outcomes on micro, meso and 
macro levels.
The results of this study align with the hypothesis that a patient experience of (dis)empowerment is 
conducive to their position in the social world and interwoven between the three ecological levels. 
Therefore, we should consider all three levels and a patient’s social position when considering 
patient empowerment through DH, as opposed to heavily relying on the micro-level which privileges 
neoliberalist ideals. 
This study shows how mobile health applications can be dualistically empowering and 
disempowering, affecting participants situated on different intersections of the social world in a 
distinct way. Going forward, DH interventions must be designed with an intersectional framework in 
mind.
The utilization of DH which is grounded in cross-level analyses and intersectional feminism can help 
alleviate health inequalities and bolster inclusion – but if not addressed, the health disparities we 
already see in our social world will only be amplified further through DH."
Identifying the Challenges of Applying “User Stories” in Practice and Exploring Possible Remedies: a Case Study,"['Vries, Anne-Claire de']","['Dalpiaz, Fabiano']",2022-12-09T01:01:27Z,EN,"['User Stories, Agile Software Development, ASD, Requirements Engineering, Agile RE']",Human-Computer Interaction,"Agile Software Development (ASD) has become an increasingly popular methodology used in the software development industry. Within ASD, User Stories (USs) are by far the most widely used notation for expressing requirements. Despite this, very few studies have investigated the application of USs in practice, with most existing research being focused on developing solutions for US problems situated in narrowly defined agile RE contexts.

In this thesis, we addressed this research gap by investigating the application of USs in a real-life ASD project, identifying problem areas and testing a possible remedy. 

The US issues we observed in our case study included: (1) inconsistent use of the US format and (2) issue types, (3) limited use of hierarchical relations and (4) difficulty deciding what to include in different backlog items.

To help remedy these issues, we designed, implemented and evaluated the Backlog Item Categorization Model (BICM), a methodological framework consisting of a decision tree  and accompanying information sheet to help inform the process of creating and/or modifying product backlog items. Our evaluation of the BICM showed that it was successful in achieving its objectives, with no observed inconsistencies regarding use of the US format and issue types and an increase in the use of hierarchical levels in the team’s product backlog after a three week intervention period. 

As such, this thesis offer novel insights into US challenges and paves the way for future research to increase the practical relevance of US research and solutions."

Configurationalism: An Alternative to and Generalization of Darwinism,"['Hafkenscheid, Sam']","['Nieves-Delgado, A']",2022-12-21T01:01:10Z,EN,"['Configurationalism, Darwinism, Neo-Darwinism, Modern Synthesis, Evolution, Natural Selection, Fitness, Adaptation, Struggle for Existence, Nature of Selection, Nature of Fitness, Unit of Selection, Biological Design, Altruism, Evolution of Altruism, Group Selection, Eusociality, Evolution of Eusociality, Spatial Expansion, Temporal Propagation, Volumetric Occupation, Planetary Fungus, Giant Fungus']",History and Philosophy of Science,"In this thesis I present Configurationalism as an alternative to and generalization of Darwinism. Darwinism is the interpretative framework used to make sense of biological evolution in terms of concepts such as fitness, natural selection and adaptation. Darwinism is built upon two core ideas. The first ideas is that of biological design which, among other things, includes the idea that individuals adapt to their environment. The second idea is that of the struggle for existence which is understood in terms of individuals competing for survival and reproduction.

Configurationalism is an alternative to Darwinism, because it rejects the idea that individuals adapt to their environment. It might be scientific fact that individuals change over time in the presence of certain environmental factors, but it is metaphysical speculation to infer from such change that the individuals involved are `adapting to their environment'. Configurationalism is a generalization of Darwinism, because it generalizes the struggle for existence from being about individuals competing for survival and reproduction to patterns competing for volumetric occupation.

One of the reasons one might prefer Configurationalism over Darwinism as an interpretative framework for biological evolution, is because it is better able to accommodate for the evolution of non-reproducing entities like, for example, giant fungi and tree groves. It is also better able to accommodate for the evolution of entities which do not have a fundamental unit of heredity, but instead create offspring in the image of their physical constitution at the time of creation. Consequently, the evolution of altruism, as well as worker castes in eusocial insects, is more easily made sense of within a Configurationalistic framework than a Darwinian framework.

Such a change in understanding of both biological design and the struggle for existence has important consequences for how one makes sense of biological evolution. Whereas Darwinism, generally speaking, understands natural selection in terms of the differential survival and reproduction of individuals, Configurationalism understands natural selection in terms of the differential spatial expansion and temporal propagation of patterns. Similarly, whereas Darwinism understands fitness in terms of an individual’s ability to survive and reproduce, Configurationalism understands fitness in terms of the rate at which a pattern increases in volumetric occupation.

This change in the understanding of biological evolution has, in turn, important consequences for how one understands the nature of selection, the unit of selection and the nature of fitness. From the Configurationalist perspective, natural selection is a form of evolution and not a cause of evolution. Furthermore, two distinct forms of natural selection exist: system-level natural selection, defined in terms of the shape of an evolutionary trajectory, and ensemble-level natural selection, defined in terms of the representatives of an evolutionary trajectory. This distinction helps clarify the difference between natural selection as process and as outcome.

Furthermore, from the Configurationalist perspective there is no unit of selection, not in terms of a unit that benefits from evolution nor in terms of a unit that natural selection acts on. Patterns, and therefore traits, increase in representation `for their own sake' and not for the sake of the survival and reproduction of the trait carrier they are attached to. Similarly, fitness should be understood as being a growth rate which reflects the rate at which a trait increases in representation and not a disposition which reflects the ability of an individual to survive and reproduce."
"“I know what it means to look at the flag  and not have it protect all of your liberties.”: Exploring Megan Rapinoe’s Anthem Protest as a
Negotiation of the Athlete’s Reproduction of the Nation","['Blijker, Tobin den']","['Hossain, Adnan']",2022-12-20T01:01:23Z,EN,['athlete; nation; nationalism; activism; Megan Rapinoe; representation'],Gender Studies (Research),"In 2016, United States’ women’s national soccer team (USWNT) athlete Megan Rapinoe made headlines when she kneeled during the national anthem. Doing so, Rapinoe followed the example of fellow athlete Colin Kaepernick, who had kneeled to protest police brutality. In this thesis, I add to existing research on athletes and their representation and reproduction of the nation by investigating the queer potential of actions such as kneeling as an athlete representing the nation, following José Muñoz’ (2009) definition of queerness as a rejection of the here and now and a longing for a better future. Taking Rapinoe’s kneeling as a starting point, this thesis asks how Rapinoe’s kneeling can be read as a negotiation of the way that she, as a national athlete, is expected to reproduce the U.S. nation. This question takes me through different topics. Following Benedict Anderson (1983 [2006]), I investigate the Western nation as a constructed imagined community, which is constantly reproduced by its members through participation in invented traditions and narratives about the nation (Mayer 2000; Hall 1992; Hobsbawm 1983). Not all members are treated equally in this nation, as norms and beliefs enforced by the nation invite discrimination and oppression of members based on race (Gilroy 1987; Yuval-Davis 1997), gender (Mosse 1985; Yuval-Davis 1997), sexuality (Mayer 2000; Mosse 1985) and other factors. 

In my analysis of the 2019 FIFA documentary USWNT: A Nation’s Story about the USWNT, I find that the athletes of this team mostly reproduce the nation through participation in national culture, such as standing for the national anthem, rather than rejecting this nation and its exclusionary aspects. However, the potential for this rejection is still here, as I note in my investigation of Megan Rapinoe’s kneeling in 2016, and later the rest of the team’s kneeling in 2020, which I investigate through analysis of Rapinoe’s autobiography and newspaper articles about these topics. This potential, however, is never fully realized, as Rapinoe framed her own kneeling in 2016 as a patriotic act, and the team’s kneeling in 2020 was not perceived as a refusal of the nation by the U.S. Soccer Federation, but rather an action in favor of Black Lives Matter that was supported by the federation. Finally, I conclude that Rapinoe’s kneeling exemplifies a negotiation between, on the one hand, a refusal of the nation in order to long for a better world, and, on the other hand, the expectations posed on her as a national athlete to reproduce the oppressive nation. In this negotiation, the queer potential of kneeling was never realized."

This thesis focuses on silicified conglomerates, chert and silica veins from three different localities of the ~3.26 Ga Fig Tree Group of the Barberton Greenstone Belt: 1) Eastern Barite Valley 2) the Masenjane Barite Workings and 3) Puddingstone Hill. Chert, jaspilite and ferruginous sediment conglomerate clasts display Rare Earth Element & Yttrium (REE+Y) patterns of heavy REEs enriched over light REEs (HREE>LREE), variably positive Eu anomalies and often super-chondritic Y/Ho ratios. These patterns are consistent with precipitation of these chemical sediments from fluids derived from Archean seawater. Eu anomalies in some of these clasts are more positive than those expected from contemporaneous seawater. This has been used to conclude that low-temperature hydrothermal venting was occurring in some segments of the basin whilst silicification was occurring. Silicified sediments are also represented by some of the conglomerates clasts. These sediments often display REE+Y patterns which deviate from the flat REE+Y patterns expected from sedimentary material. Instead, they also exhibit REE+Y patterns consistent with Archean marine waters. Similar REE+Y patterns are observed in the matrix material of the conglomerates. These results have been used to conclude that sedimentary sequences in the Fig Tree Group were silicified by seawater-derived fluids. REE+Y patterns of some silica veins found in the Eastern Barite Valley and Masenjane Barite Workings also imply formation from a seawater-derived fluid. Mafic signatures observed in these samples also disagree with previous interpretations that these silica veins represent silicified felsic ash. Instead, elevated Cr values indicate relatively deep circulation of a silicifying-fluid through the underlying Onverwacht strata caused these silica veins to form."
"Multi-fidelity spatial regression for air temperature predictions using first, second and third party data","['Beekvelt, Daniëlle van']","['Frank, Jason']",2022-12-20T01:00:59Z,EN,"['Kriging, Gaussian Processes, third-party data']",Mathematical Sciences,"There has been a growing interest in using second and third party data in addition to first party data to make weather predictions. This development is necessary, because it can provide predictions for a higher spatial resolution than the predictions made using only first party data. Consequently, weather phenomena with a high spatial variability such as rain and wind could be predicted more accurately. However, it has not been shown before that using WOW-data as third party data leads to accurate predictions. In this thesis a modified version of the interpolation method of Kriging will be used to demonstrate the value of WOW-data in weather predictions. The Kriging procedure is modified such that it will be able to work with noisy data and such that it can differentiate between the systematic and random errors in first, second and third party data.
The robustness of the method is examined by using synthetic data such that the model can be tested for weather of various spatial variabilities. These tests show that up to a certain spatial variability first, first and second, and first, second and third party data perform equally well. However, after a certain threshold is reached ,first and second, and first, second and third party data perform better than just first party data."
Molecular Basis of Overcoming Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Resistance by Targeting Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells,"['Oosterom, Fleur van']","['Leusen, Jeanette']",2022-12-17T01:00:59Z,EN,['ICI therapy; TME; MDSCs; Combination therapy; Resistance'],Infection and Immunity,"In the last decades, new strategies such as Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) therapy have increased survival chances for cancer patients considerably and have become one of the leading immunotherapies to combat cancer. Immune Checkpoint Proteins are expressed to maintain immune homeostasis and prevent autoimmune disease. Using ICI therapy, activation of cytotoxic T cells is promoted with monoclonal antibodies. However, responses to ICI therapy are highly dependent upon the (immunosuppressive) tumor microenvironment (TME). One of the major drivers in creating this immunosuppressive environment are Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs). MDSCs are a heterogenous population of immature myeloid cells that inhibit T cell proliferation, differentiation and activation. Thereby, MDSCs play a major role in the development of resistance to ICI therapy. In this paper, we review different MDSC targeting strategies, such as depletion, inhibition of immunosuppressive characteristics, and promoting maturation. Furthermore, we assess the  potential to overcome ICI resistance by combining ICI therapy with targeting of MDSCs. Studies combining FDA approved anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 ICI therapies in combination with MDSC targets show reduced MDSC levels and enhances cytotoxic T cell infiltration in the TME of preclinical mouse models, as well as in clinical trials. Therefore, we conclude that targeting important molecular pathways in MDSCs can be used to overcome ICI resistance. However, since the TME is unique for every tumor, more research into molecular pathways is necessary to pave the way towards personalized medicine."
The 2004 European Enlargement Round and the Curious Case of Cyprus,"['Aristofanous, ARISTOFANIS']","['Pechlivanis, Paschalis']",2022-07-23T00:00:35Z,EN,['Cyprus; European Union; Greece; Turkey;  Eastern Enlargement;'],International Relations in Historical Perspective,"The island nation of Cyprus was part of the 2004 Eastern Enlargement round despite the 
country’s inability to adhere to the EU membership criteria. The sensitive political situation that 
exists since 1974 was predicted to cause several problems to the European Union, making the 
country’s accession puzzling. The dominant theoretical narratives explaining the EU Eastern 
Enlargement round, based on the underlying principles of rationalism and constructivism fail to 
convincingly explain this historical development creating a gap in the literature. In this thesis 
intergovernmentalism and institutionalism is applied to provide better understanding of the 
motives and decision-making process of the European Union. The historical analysis has 
demonstrated that the Cyprus’ institutional upgrades came as result of a series of threats and side 
deals made by Greece, as Athens used its position as an EU member state to benefit Cyprus’ 
European cause. The EU was forced to accept the problematic Cypriot membership in order to 
safeguard the rest of the Eastern Enlargement project and to create a closer institutional 
relationship with Greece’s regional rival, Turkey. This analysis reveals that the EU behavior 
towards enlargement is guided for a large part, by side deals, side payments and the balancing of 
interests of the EU member states and candidate countries."
Proteasome Catalysed Peptide Splicing: How studying proteasome arts and crafts can increase our understanding of epitope generation,"['Bakx, Jacco']","['Sijts, Alice']",2023-01-01T00:00:42Z,EN,['Proteasome Catalysed Peptide Splicing; PCPS; Protein electroporation; B3Z assay; Antigen presentation'],Infection and Immunity,"In order to fight off pathogens and tumours, the body makes a lot of use of little pieces of information called peptides, which can be derived from proteins in a cell. By using the proteasome, a molecular scissor inside the cell, the body can cut up these proteins and present them on a silver platter on the cell surface, also known as the MHC molecules. From there, it can be recognized by immune cells in the body and a fitting reaction can take place, such as the production of antibodies or the killing of tumour cells. This creates a system where there is continuous sampling of the waste products of the cells and allows the body to respond to unknown peptides in a quick and specific matter.
Interestingly, it has been discovered that peptides exist that are not made from simply cutting up existing proteins, called non-canonical peptides. So far it has been unclear what the actual mechanism behind the generation of these peptides is, although possible origins have been proposed. Most theories propose that these peptides are cut from proteins made from faulty blueprints, which normally should not be present.
In this report, one such origin will be explored, the so-called Proteasome Catalysed Peptide Splicing (PCPS). According to this theory, the proteasome does not simply cut all the different proteins, but is also able to paste distant regions of the protein together to create new peptides. To achieve this, we took a protein that was known to produce non-canonical peptides and replaced that part with a widely used reporter peptide (SIINFEKL, derived from egg white proteins), that was either complete or split into two parts (split SIIN/FEKL). These proteins could then be produced inside bacteria and could be purified after, allowing us to use them in further experiments.
Subsequently, we transferred this protein into a cell by giving it electric shocks. After giving the cells time to recover and process the proteins, we then used a reporter cell that could recognize (non-split) SIINFEKL. Afterwards, we could then compare the cells that we gave SIINFEKL-containing proteins, split SIINFEKL-containing proteins or proteins containing neither.
Using this method, we were able to efficiently bring proteins that were produced in bacteria into mammalian cells. Additionally, we saw a presence of non-split SIINFEKL in cells that we only electroporated with split SIINFEKL. From this, we concluded that the proteasome could indeed paste distant parts of proteins together through PCPS. 
By modifying parts of the model protein, we can further study the mechanism behind PCPS in future experiments. By better understanding the way in which these non-canonical peptides are produced, we can more accurately predict in the future which peptides can be generated from a given protein. In turn, this will allow us to make better vaccines against pathogens and even tumour cells."
Visual attention in infancy: Using online webcam recordings as a proof of concept,"['Jansen, Maaike']","['Wijnen, Frank']",2023-01-01T00:00:46Z,EN,['Visual attention; preferential looking; infancy; online experiment; webcam recordings; proof of concept'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Many infant studies have small and homogenic samples, which leads to low statistical power, low statistical conclusion validity, and low external validity; hence, the conclusions drawn in these studies might not be representative to the general population. To resolve such limitations, the ManyBabies Consortium aims to develop universal methodological frameworks to replicate key findings in developmental studies with large, heterogenic samples. This experimental pilot study (n = 16) of the ManyBabies-AtHome project examined whether it is feasible to track 8- to 10-months-old infants’ visual attention in their home environment using remote webcam recordings, to replicate findings of infants’ preference for dynamic over static stimuli. Additionally, it was explored whether one of the two elaborated preferential looking designs, subsequential or side-by-side, suits this remote preferential looking testing framework better. In accordance with the hypotheses, this study showed that infants’ preference for dynamic stimuli could be replicated using remote webcam recordings. Moreover, no clear distinction in suitability for one of the two designs was found, with good and excellent inter-rater reliability scores for the designs, and spatial location of stimuli on the screen could be accurately determined by observers based on average total looking-times. Thus, it seems that visual attention can be examined using remote visual preference paradigms, which can possibly enhance the validity of future infant studies through increase of sample sizes and heterogeneity of samples."

Their deployment tailors designs and prototypes while integrating cell culture and hydrogel development in micro-perfused platforms. These novel platforms allow the establishment and perfusion of 3D bioprinted cellular scaffolds, which have proven to be more efficient in tissue engineering than traditional 2D cell culture. 3D scaffolds tend to derive from hydrogels, which are highly tuneable, natural or synthetic water-based matrixes that allow for functionalization with extracellular matrix-like molecules and cues. Physiologic microenvironments are highly complex, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions maintain homeostasis in native tissue. When homeostatic interactions are lost, the microenvironment shifts to a diseased state. To cure a disease, it is important to understand the intricate complexity of these microenvironments. In-vitro models try to recapitulate physiologic microenvironments to better understand the disease progression and how to restore the healthy state.
In this project, biofabrication and tissue engineering techniques are combined to advance the field of bioreactor-like in-vitro models for inflammatory diseases of the knee joint environment. Volumetric bioprinting is a novel 3D printing technique, here optimized for BM-hMSC scaffolds for trabecular bone. Candidate materials for the osteochondral interface are assayed. A two-chamber bioreactor is custom designed and assembled to perfuse a bone and a cartilage compartment independently with an engineered osteochondral interface as a physical barrier."

This study aimed to develop a sucrose-system, using sucrose mutants as a proof of concept to test a set of pilot experiments that were in turn developed to make a standardized way of assessing mutant to wild type interactions. Due to time limitations, the pilot experiments were ultimately tested using an available uncharacterized glucoamylase mutant. In literature it is described that high relatedness among individuals lowers the chances of a cheater to incorporate into the germline. Therefore, hypothesis was that since the strains are very related, they would cooperate. The results suggest that the mutant might act as a cheater in liquid cultures."
"High-temperature fluctuations of the deep ocean: an early Eocene clumped isotope (Δ47) temperature record of ODP Site 1263, Walvis Ridge","['Koene, Bas']","['Lourens, Lucas']",2023-01-01T01:00:44Z,EN,['early Eocene; clumped isotopes; stable isotopes; deep ocean temperature; global mean surface temperature; climate sensitivity; benthic foraminifera'],"Earth, Life and Climate","The continued emissions of carbon-dioxide poses a threat to the global community, of which the magnitude depends on the sensitivity of the climate. However, constraints on the climate sensitivity are still very uncertain, and more pessimistic emission scenarios appear to become more relevant. Studying the climate of the early Eocene (56-47.8 Ma) hothouse presents us with a way to confine these uncertainties, and to investigate the mechanisms that may become relevant at higher carbon-dioxide levels. 
	In this study, deep ocean temperatures and seawater δ18O are reconstructed using ‘clumped isotopes’ (∆47). As opposed to other temperature proxies, such as TEX86, Mg/Ca and the classical δ18O, clumped isotopes are independent of seawater chemistry vital effects, and is purely thermodynamical. The clumped isotopes are measured on the Nuttallides truempyi, Oridorsalis umbonatus, Cibicidoides spp, and Hanzawaia ammophila benthic foraminifera species using isotope ratio mass spectrometry.
	A total of six reconstructed temperatures spanning the entire early Eocene are presented. Of particular interest is the early Eocene Climate Optimum (EECO, ~51.5-49.5 Ma), a period in which Earth’s surface temperature culminated. A deep ocean warming of ~7.22 ±4.44 °C is recorded between 53 Ma and the EECO, after which a cooling of ~5.29 ±4.37 °C occurred in a few million years span, towards 48 Ma. These temperatures are not recorded by δ18O, and poorly in Mg/Ca, most likely due to problems with those proxies. A potential pH-effect in the δ18O of benthic foraminifera is investigated, but the current understanding is insufficient for taking conclusions. Moreover, sea surface temperatures do not reflect changes in the deep ocean during the early Eocene, exposing problems with the calibrations for the TEX86 temperature proxy, as well as assumptions of surface and deep ocean coupling, usually done based on benthic δ18O alone.
	The δ18O composition of the seawater (δ18Ow) has been recalculated for the Eocene, revealing much heavier values than conventionally assumed. δ18Ow values as heavy as 0.61 ‰ VSMOW were recorded, which was usually taken to be -0.98 ‰, assuming that the early Eocene was ice-free. This puts forward a series of complications that need explaining with regard to the origin of the δ18Ow and overall ocean circulation, which are explored here.
	New estimates for climate sensitivity during the EECO reveal a temperature change of 6.0 °C per doubling in carbon-dioxide (CO2), with a maximum of 9.1 °C minimum of 4.1 °C. This is higher than estimates based on benthic δ18O. The new ∆47-derived climate sensitivity is in line with a recent climate model simulation which contains enhanced cloud microphysics, and agrees with a recent Mg/Ca temperatures and boron-based CO2 study. The findings here support a climate-state dependency of climate sensitivity.
	Altogether, clumped isotope thermometry brings the need for critically re-evaluating long-standing assumptions, which may in the end help in a better understanding of the Earth System, and thus establishing better climate models and predictions for future climate warming."
A proof of concept for mapping environmental change in areas of resource extraction at the source of energy transition supply chains.,"['Teichtmann, Simon']","['Ricker, Britta']",2023-01-01T02:01:40Z,EN,['remote sensing; energy transition; time series; open access; resource extraction;'],Sustainable Development,"The availability of cloud computing and open access satellite data provides new opportunities for the application of earth observation (EO) based environmental monitoring. Mapping the environmental change resulting from resource extraction at the source of energy transition supply chains represents a particularly interesting application for these services. The energy transition fosters a high resource demand, and the extraction of resources goes hand in hand with the appropriation and exploitation of land, often conducted with little or no environmental concerns. Using Google Earth Engine (GEE), Landsat and Sentinel imagery, I developed an example of a workflow model to create remote sensing time series to measure land cover and vegetation change. The model is based on scripts using the programming language JavaScript. To test the workflow, it was applied to two case studies, mapping change resulting from graphite and natural gas extraction in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique. The case studies were investigated in time series between 2005 and 2021. The analyses shows that extraction related facilities and infrastructure replace, to a large areal extent, natural areas and cause a significant increase in unvegetated areas. Thereby, the workflow model yielded high classification accuracies of > 90 %. Testing the model in both case studies proved it reproducible and scalable under the requisite that specific parameters, such as the region of interest and time series intervals are provided as inputs to the scripts. The use of open access satellite imagery and the GEE platform make the model applicable in circumstances of low financial and technical means, as data is free and no costly hard- and software is required. Therefore, the proposed workflow can be particularly beneficial to monitor change in areas of resource extraction which commonly occur in vulnerable, low-income regions, where Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and their follow ups are often weak or being neglected. Hence, my workflow model provides a reliable solution to map change at the source of energy transition supply chains in an effort for a more sustainable energy transition. By identifying and quantifying the change, private and non-profit decision makers can develop and enhance plans to preserve, manage and restore adjacent land and nature and protect local communities."
Signature SBS7a in pediatric BCP-ALL,"['Suurenbroek, Lianne']","['Kuiper, Roland']",2023-01-01T02:01:34Z,EN,['Mutational Signatures; BCP-ALL; Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia'],"Cancer, Stem Cells and Developmental Biology","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer in the 
Netherlands, with an incidence of around 115 new cases per year. Although the survival 
rates have reached 90%, the underlying mutational mechanisms are still not fully
understood. Multiple genetic subtypes have been identified, with large differences in 
prognosis. While patients with ALL typically have a very low tumor mutation burden (TMB), 
some patients show the presence of an active mutational process which can increase the 
TMB1–3
. To gain insight into which mutational processes play a role in the carcinogenesis and 
drug resistance of ALL, we extracted mutational signatures from whole genome sequencing 
data. Strikingly, we have identified 14 patients with ALL across multiple cohorts who show a 
mutational profile similar to single base substitution signature 7a (SBS7a), which is typically 
seen in melanomas and has been associated with damage by ultraviolet (UV) light. 
Here, we aim to study the etiology of mutational signature SBS7a in ALL by analyzing 
common features between SBS7a-positive ALL samples and comparing them with those 
found in melanomas. Major copy number alterations (CNAs) were often found in 
chromosome 21. Additionally, copy number analysis showed that the presence of signature 
SBS7a is enriched within the group of ALL patients with intrachromosomal amplifications of 
chromosome 21 (iAMP21). While amplifications of chromosome 21 were found to be 
neither sufficient nor necessary for the development of signature SBS7a, CNAs were always 
present prior to SBS7a mutations.
Next, we compared SBS7a-postive ALL patients to patients with melanomas, in which SBS7a 
is known to be caused by UV light, to investigate a possible role for UV light in the 
mutagenesis of ALL. While some characteristics of SBS7a in melanomas could also be found 
in ALL, such as an overrepresentation of SNVs on the untranscribed strand of the
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), no replication bias was found. All patients with signature 
SBS7a also showed the presence of doublet base substitution signature 1 (DBS1), which can 
be caused by UV light. The presence of insertion and deletion signature 13 (indel/ID13), 
however, could not be identified in patients with ALL, as opposed to most melanoma cases. 
Patients who had developed relapses provided information about the timing of SBS7a, 
showing that no new SBS7a mutations were gained after the initial diagnosis in 3 out of 5 
patients. In the other 2 patients, however, new SBS7a mutations were present in the first 
relapse.
Lastly, our data shows that SBS7a can influence disease progression through the inactivation 
of glucocorticoid-related genes, potentially leading to prednisolone resistance. Although UV 
light is unlikely to play a role in the development of ALL, our results show the presence of a 
similar type of damage in ALL for which the underlying mutational process has not yet been 
identified."

rise, resulting in changed sediment dynamics and a process called sediment starvation. Traditionally, 
hard and impermeable structures are constructed on intertidal foreshores to attenuate wave energy 
and restore the disbalance in sediment dynamics. However, wave reflection and scouring in front of 
the structure are reasons why there is a growing consensus toward more permeable and biogenic 
structures in coastal defence schemes. The assessment of the interaction of waves with these 
permeable structures is limited in the literature. This flume study quantified and compared wave 
attenuation, reflection, and scouring potential of different-sized gabions filled with empty oyster 
shells, empty mussel shells, loose brushwood, and bundled brushwood to a hard brick stone
structure under varying hydrodynamical conditions. The results show that consistent differences in 
wave attenuation were hardly observed between hard and biogenic materials. The emerged mussel 
structure even attenuated wave energy best for low submergence ratios. Emerged hard structures 
with low submergence ratios did generate up to 46.2% more wave reflection than the various 
biogenic structures for incident short-period waves. There was also a higher bed shear stress under 
wave action measured just before the emerged hard structure. Additionally, the correlation between 
wave reflection/attenuation and relative submergence showed a large spread, highlighting the 
importance of incident wave characteristics in describing this correlation. The findings demonstrate 
why there is increasing attention to using biogenic structures to protect intertidal areas from 
sediment starvation and can be used as guidelines for implementation under natural conditions."

 in isolation. However, objects are not viewed in isolation in the real world;
 instead, they are viewed within a context. This paper explores brain activity
 based on fMRI-measured blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response using
a task that is designed to test the ability of the brain to distinguish between
 congruent and incongruent objects within a scene. In this context, the quality of
 ""congruency"" describes the relationship between expected object size and the
 scene in which the object is placed. Analysis of the data obtained from this
 experiment showed a significant difference between brain activity when viewing
 an object in an incongruent or congruent context. Further, we can use support
vector classifier (SVC) models to more sensitively predict whether a participant
 was looking at a congruent or incongruent object better than random chance.
 The findings of our analysis are consistent with current research in the field and
offer a more detailed study of this neuroimaging finding. In our analysis, the
 fusiform face area was also found to be a strong predictor of congruency - a
finding that is consistent with the most recent research in the field. Further,
 using searchlight analysis, we find voxels that discriminate on congruency in
line with existing literature: the lateral occipital cortex and early visual cortex.
 However, areas that have received less attention are also strongly discriminant
on congruency based on this analysis, namely the prefrontal cortex and caudate
 nucleus. Owing to these areas’ high activity during expectation-violations, we
 can conclude that the lateral occipital cortex and the early visual cortex are
important to determining size-context relationship violations. However, the
 prefrontal cortex, caudate nucleus, and potentially other areas are also highly
 active and show congruency discrimination. This suggests involvement of a large
part of the brain during object recognition and expectation-violation, and not
 the compartmentalised view of this process as older literature suggests. Lastly,
 activation within the fusiform face area was found to be a strong indicator of
 congruency"

However, gender is an important factor that determines an individual’s vulnerability to climate extremes and disasters and needs to be recognized in policymaking and disaster-risk reduction management. One form of such gendered vulnerability is vulnerability to sexual and gender-based violence. Studies have shown that in the wake of a climate disasters, (sexual) violence against women increases. One such example is the case study of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. In the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan, reports of increasing violence against women were alarming. 
Through an intersectional, ecofeminist gender analysis, this thesis seeks to identify causes for the increase in violence after Typhoon Haiyan by considering humanitarian challenges the typhoon posed, as well as how the typhoon intersected with existing societal and patriarchal structures of inequality creating and enabling gendered violence. Through the example of the case study, this thesis examines how insights on gendered dynamics in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan can be used to strengthen policy frameworks on disaster-risk reduction and climate mitigation to reduce gendered vulnerability to sexual and gender-based violence.
Gender, disasters, and climate change can no longer be treated as separate issues. An intersectional, ecofeminist and gender-transformative approach to policy frameworks is essential to treat gender, disaster-risk reduction, and climate change goals as inseparable, as the move towards sustainability and climate justice cannot be achieved without addressing and transforming inequalities producing gendered vulnerabilities."

De broodzetting in Nederland verschilde met prijsregulerende systemen in andere landen en perioden doordat het doel van de broodzetting niet was om brood betaalbaar te houden. Wel was door de broodzetting de broodprijs altijd gebaseerd op de kostprijs. De marktintegratie blijkt over de gehele periode groot en neemt toe gedurende de halve eeuw.

Bij een klein gedeelte van de geïnfecteerde mensen (1-5%) kan de bacterie in het lichaam aanwezig blijven. De bacterie gaat dan vaak op een hartklep of de aorta zitten, met name als die persoon door een eerdere operatie al een prothese heeft aan de hartklep of aorta. Als hier sprake van is, noemen we het chronische Q-koorts. Chronische Q-koorts kan ernstige gevolgen hebben. Het kan leiden tot een gescheurde aorta en zelfs tot de dood. In dit onderzoek focussen we op de groep chronische Q-koorts patiënten met een infectie aan de aorta.

Om te voorkomen dat iemand met een geïnfecteerde aorta ernstige complicaties krijgt, behandelen we diegene langdurig met antibiotica. Daarnaast kan je diegene opereren. Momenteel is het alleen niet duidelijk welke operatie het beste werkt; het gebruik van kunstmateriaal of eigen materiaal. Het gebruik van eigen materiaal is een relatief nieuwe methode waarbij ze een ader uit het been omvormen en hier de aorta mee vervangen. Een groot voordeel van eigen materiaal ten opzichte van kunstmateriaal is dat eigen materiaal minder snel opnieuw geïnfecteerd raakt met een bacterie.

In de afgelopen jaren is informatie over alle chronische Q-koorts patiënten in Nederland opgeslagen in de Nationale Chronische Q-koorts Database. Hieruit zijn alle patiënten met een operatie aan een geïnfecteerde aorta of vaatprothese geselecteerd. Daarna is gekeken welk type operatie zij hebben gehad: 27 operaties met eigen materiaal (beenader) en 63 operaties met kunstmateriaal. Deze twee groepen zijn, na correctie, vergeleken door middel van een survival analyse. Hieruit bleek dat personen die een operatie hebben gehad met eigen materiaal minder complicaties hebben en de bacterie beter uit het lichaam verwijderd werd dan bij de personen met kunstmateriaal.

Het is belangrijk om te beseffen dat de patiënten in dit onderzoek niet willekeurig zijn ingedeeld in één van de twee groepen, zoals je het liefst hebt bij het onderzoeken welke behandeling het beste is voor een ziekte. De toenmalig behandelend arts heeft bepaald wat voor type operatie iemand kreeg. Het is dus mogelijk dat artsen met name ziekere en/of oudere patiënten met kunstmateriaal hebben behandeld, terwijl deze groep sowieso vaker complicaties krijgt na een operatie. In deze studie hebben we hier zoveel mogelijk voor geprobeerd te corrigeren. Volledig corrigeren is echter niet mogelijk.

In dit onderzoek concluderen we dat chronische Q-koorts patiënten met een geïnfecteerde aorta het beste geopereerd kunnen worden met eigen materiaal vanuit, mits een patiënt hiervoor in aanmerking komt."
Hierarchical self-assembly of surfactant/polysaccharide complexes studied by small angle X-ray scattering,"['Komarova, Tatiana']","['Petoukhov, A.']",2023-01-01T02:01:17Z,EN,['self-assembly; SAXS; pressure jump; β-cyclodextrine; SDS;'],Nanomaterials Science,"Aqueous solutions of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) are known to spontaneously form concentration-dependent assemblies with complex multiscale structure. In particular, supramolecular multilayered tubular aggregates exhibit striking morphological similarities with peptide nanotubes, bacterial protein shells, or multiwalled carbon nanotubes that hint at the existence of some similarities in their formation mechanism. Since the spatial scales involved in this mechanism range from about a nanometer (the size of SDS@2β-CD complexes) through a micron (microtube diameter), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is an ideal experimental technique that allows one to track changes in the structural organization on different length scales. According to the results of recent SAXS experiments, temperatureinduced microtube assembly/disassembly follows the inward growth mechanism proposed earlier. The outermost tube radius is highly sensitive to the temperature, while SDS@2β-CD complex concentration insignificantly affects this quantity. As temperature increases towards the melting point, the number of walls inside a microtube decreases, and the microtube swells. As a result of the interplay between the bending energy and bond formation, the temperature dependence of the outermost radius of microtubes sheds light on the energetics of the self-assembly, allowing us to estimate the energies of H-bonds involved in this process. On the contrary, the system demonstrates a different, two-level response to the applied moderate hydrostatic pressure (100-200 bar). The first, fast process (~0.3 s) involves the shrinking ofmicrotubes without any significant changes in the number of cylinders inside or the distance between them. In the second slower process (~tens s), inner layers of microtubes disintegrate as less energetically favourable. Opposite to the temperature static studies, this disassembly process is irreversible. After pressure is released, the structure does not return to the initial state presumably being stuck in a local minimum on the energy landscape."
"Interactions between drug regulatory authorities and academia: motivations, barriers, and suggestions","['Chen, Li-Yu']","['Hoekman, Jarno']",2023-01-01T02:00:56Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"In recent decades, there’s been a growing trend in universities to interact with non-academic partners. The term ‘academic engagement’ describes the interactions and activities between academia and these partners, including industries and governmental organizations. Commercialization activities that involve patenting, licensing, and establishing spin-out companies are common for the interactions between university and industry, or so-called University-Industry (U-I) interactions. Examples of University-Government (U-G) interactions previously identified in the literature include advising, school projects, and public exhibitions.
Among different U-G interactions, University-Regulator (U-R) interactions refer to those relevant to policymaking and granting legal approval. This study focused on the ones between universities and drug regulatory authorities. U-R interactions in drug development appealed to us for a couple of reasons. Compared to other fields of expertise, U-R interactions in drug development are more common and the bond between academia and regulatory authorities is fairly tight. Moreover, further insights on U-R interactions in drug development were expected to optimize the drug development procedure. 
We conducted an interview study to understand the context of U-R interactions in drug development and regulations, motivations for academics and regulators to interact with each other, potential barriers in these interactions, and suggestions perceived by both parties to improve the situation. In total, 21 experts from Dutch academia and Dutch and European regulatory authorities participated in the interviews. The online interviews were recorded and transcribed. The transcripts were later analyzed qualitatively to answer our research questions.
This study revealed some U-R interactions in drug development that overlapped with U-I and general U-G interactions. People-based activities such as giving lectures and advising were examples of these mutual interactions. On the other hand, interactions on the approval of products were exclusive to U-R interactions, given the regulators’ distinct roles as policy and decision makers. Furthermore, this study concluded that academics and regulators were motivated to interact with each other. We also discovered specific motivations that matched certain contexts of U-R interactions. Optimizing drug development procedures that bring patients timely access to drugs as their mutual goal, academics and regulators identified current barriers to overcome and provided potential suggestions to strengthen U-R relationships in drug development. On top of the barriers respectively experienced by academics and regulators such as lacking time and having to maintain independence, lacking funding was found to be a joint barrier that both sides shared. The suggestions given by the respondents in the study surrounded the concepts of improving either the quality or quantity of U-R interactions in drug development. While educating academics on regulatory affairs could improve U-R interaction’s quality, engaging regulators early in development plans could increase its quantity. To sum up, the results of this study offered valuable insights that would assist drug regulators in making future policies that bring substantial benefits to public health."
The validation of the cost-effectiveness signal of the Dutch National Healthcare Institute as a valid method to provide a rough estimation of the cost-effectiveness of a pharmaceutical intervention.,"['Wiggers, Nikki']","['Vreman, R.A.']",2023-01-01T02:01:02Z,EN,"['Cost-effectiveness analysis, health technology assessment, pharmaceuticals, method development']",Farmacie,"Background
Cost-effectiveness assessments (CEAs) are a component of HTA in the Netherlands. Because they are resource consuming, the National Health Care Institute (ZIN) developed a simplified method to estimate the cost-effectiveness, called the cost-effectiveness signal (CE-signal). This study aims to investigate whether the CE-signal is a valid method to provide a conclusion on whether an intervention is likely cost-effective or cost-ineffective, and to provide suggestions for its optimization and implementation.

Methods
Assessed drugs between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021, that included a pharmacoeconomic report were reviewed. CE-signals of the included assessments were performed, including burden of disease, effectiveness estimation and cost-effectiveness determination. Validation occurred by comparing the CE-signal outcomes with those of the corresponding CEA. After evaluating the results of this analysis, the effectiveness estimation method of the CE-signal was further optimized followed by a second analysis.

Results: A total of 28 market authorisation holder (MAH) reports were included to carry out the CE-signal. Of the completed CE-signals, a total of 21 matched the CEA outcome and seven results were incorrect. After the second analysis only one false positive result remained. 

Conclusions: The results suggest that the CE-signal can be used  to replace some CEAs when the drug is likely cost-effective. In addition, most drugs seem suitable for the CE-signal, excluding one-time treatments and orphan drugs due to absence of discounting and the inherent uncertainties in the data. In addition, the effect estimation method still needs to be further optimized to prevent false positives."
The effect of abiotic stress on plant resistance to insect herbivores,"['Beek, Bart van']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-01-01T02:01:05Z,EN,"['Abiotic stress, phytohormones, insect herbivores, plant immunity']",Environmental Biology,"Plants  in  the  field  are often  subject  to  a  combination  of  abiotic  and  biotic  stress.

The resulting hormone crosstalk leads to adaptation divergent from the individualstresses. For this reason, abioticstress can influenceplant resistance towards insect herbivores.During  insect  herbivore  feeding,  plant  defense responsesare initiatedfollowingrecognition  of D/HAMPs by PRRs. Jasmonic acid (JA) together with abscisicacid (ABA) form the core signaling pathway  in  plant  resistance towardsinsect  herbivores.  Elevated  JA  and  ABA  levels  lead  to increased  expression  of MYC, MYB, WRKYtranscription  factors  resulting  in accumulation  of defensive compounds. In addition, salicylic acid (SA) isinvolved in the defense against piercing insects and insect egg deposition. However, elevated SA levels antagonize JA signaling leading to increasedinsect susceptibility.

Moreover,SA-mediated WRK22 expression during flooding further suppressesJA signaling.In addition, the accumulation of ET during submergence inhibits MYC2 expressionhampering defensive responses. Similarly,shading leads to a reduction of  active  JA  levels  due  to sulfation. The reduced  JA  levels are  found  to result  in  a  decreased accumulation of defensive compounds. In this manner, both submergence and shading increase plant susceptibilitytowards insect herbivores."
Prediction of perinatal and neonatal outcomes after preterm hypertensive complications of pregnancy: a systematic review of prediction models,"['Kooiman, Judith']","['Schuit, E.']",2023-01-01T02:00:52Z,EN,"['prediction, hypertensive disorders, pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction']",Epidemiology Postgraduate,"A small proportion of women develop complications during the preterm period of pregnancy (the period before 37 weeks of gestation). An increase in blood pressure (hypertension) in combination with organ failure is one of these complications, also known as HELLP syndrome or preeclampsia. In some pregnancies, this increase in blood pressure goes hand in hand with a growth restriction of the fetus due to placental insufficiency. A high blood pressure (with or without accompanying organ failure) can be dangerous for mother whereas placental insufficiency can result in chronic brain damage of the fetus or even stillbirth. Consequently, health of both mother and child is sometimes best served by medically-induced preterm labor.
To inform couples about the risks for the newborn of medically-induced preterm labor (such as serious breathing problems or dying due to prematurity) versus the chance of stillbirth when continuing pregnancy, risk estimates of these undesirable pregnancy outcomes are required. Such estimates can be made using prediction models, mathematical models containing information about the mother, fetus and current course of pregnancy. Using these risk estimates, couples together with their healthcare professionals can come to a decision on medical management. The aim of this research project was to summarize all available prediction models on adverse outcomes of the fetus or newborn for women dealing with complications of an high blood pressure in the preterm period of pregnancy. 
To this end, a systematic search of medical literature was performed. After model identification, the quality of the models and their robustness when using the models in external patient populations (for instance, patients with the same medical problem in another hospital or country) was studied using standardized tools and checklists by two independent researchers. Information on the performance of the prediction models was studied, which can be expressed using statistical formulas.
This literature search identified 8 studies describing 16 prediction models. None of the models were tested outside of the original study population. This is cumbersome as models tend to predict best in the population in which they were developed. Most models included ultrasonography measurements to calculate the risks of stillbirth or complications after birth, such as serious illness or death of the newborn. The methods used to create the prediction models were not in line with current standards for this type of research. Furthermore, most studies lacked important information on how the prediction models were created and how well they can predict the outcome of interest. 
This research project has four main conclusions. First, 8 studies reporting on 16 prediction models were identified and none of these models were tested outside the original study population. Second, the methods used to develop the models are not in line with current standards. Third, important information about the predictive performance of the models was lacking in most publications. Consequently and fourth, none of the prediction models described in this research project are suitable for clinical use."
Utilising Reinforcement Learning for the Diversified Top-𝑘 Clique Search Problem,"['Remmerden, Jesse van']","['Wang, Shihan']",2023-01-01T02:01:20Z,EN,['Reinforcement Learning; Diversified Top-K Clique Search;  Diversified Top-K Weighted Clique Search; PPO; Graph Neural Networks; Graph Isomorphism Networks; Combinatioral Optimisation; RL; GNN'],Artificial Intelligence,"The diversified top-𝑘 clique search problem (DTKC) problem is a diversity graph problem in which the goal is to find a clique set of 𝑘 cliques that cover the most nodes in a graph. DTKC is a combinatorial optimisation problem and can be seen as a combination of the maximum clique problem and maximal clique enumeration. In recent years, a new research field arose that research if reinforcement learning can be used for combinatorial optimisation problems. However, no reinforcement learning algorithm exists for DTKC or any other diversity graph problem. Therefore, we propose Deep Clique Comparison Agent (DCCA), which utilises PPO, Graph Isomorphic Networks and the encode-process-decode paradigm to compose an optimal clique set. We tested DCCA for DTKC and the diversified top-𝑘 weighted clique search problem (DTKWC). Our results showed that DCCA could outperform previous methods for DTKC, but only on higher values of 𝑘, such as if 𝑘 = 50. However, we only saw this occur on simpler graphs and DCCA performed significantly worse on the other problem, DTKWC. Due to the novelty of DCCA, we believe that future research can significantly improve our results."

Therefore, OGT is an interesting therapeutic target for the medical community. Current potent OGT inhibitors usually lack target specificity, e.g., BZX2 and OSMI-1, or cell-permeability e.g. OSMI-4. To explore novel OGT inhibitors, hit optimisation was performed on the recently identified compound Vs-51, creating a small library. In total, five promising derivatives of Vs-51 were synthesised, of which the most potent one inhibited the enzyme with an IC50 of 27 ± 13 µM. Furthermore, the derivatives provided improved insight into potential Vs-51 enhancements. For the second part of this study, a DNA encoded library was used to find new scaffolds for OGT, leading to two promising hits. A new synthetic pathway was established for one of these hits (10115) while allowing easy derivatisation options. The ease of tunability of the provided scaffold through the here described synthesis route offers a potential new series of potent OGT inhibitors."

The Anatomy of Explanations for Artificial Intelligence: How Explanations and Explainability Can Be Defined in the Context of Black-Box Algorithms and the GDPR,"['Hoek, Saar']","['Prakken, Henry']",2023-01-01T02:01:51Z,EN,['AI; XAI; Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning; explainability; transparency; GDPR; General Data Protection Regulation; explanations; responsible AI; black-box; law; legal aspects; post-hoc methods; interpretability;'],Artificial Intelligence,"Over the last few years, there has been an increasing interest in the transparency of computational models, in particular systems that are referred to as ‘black-box models’. These types of models, usually conceived through machine learning methodologies such as deep neural networks, have been a breakthrough of science able to perform myriad tasks that were previously thought to be the prerogative of human capability. Such advancements have already been implemented in nearly every facet of life, ranging from small-scale personalised song recommendations to international crime identification efforts. 

Although artificial intelligence has arguably improved much, its employment has not been without risk or consequence. Perhaps fuelled by reports of scandals resulting from embedded bias and an increasing need for privacy, worries about the feasibility and reliability of black-box methods have grown, particularly in the context of the opacity of the model. In addition to the societal need for transparency and checks-and-balances, the introduction of the General Data Protection Directive as well as the impending AI Act have created a legal need to improve clarity on the transparency requirements for artificial intelligence. An important aspect of this transparency is a model’s explainability. It should be clear whether a model is explainable, whether an explanation is required from the model and what such an explanation may look like. Though there has been an expanding body of academic work on explainability for artificial intelligence, little has been written about how an explanation can be defined in this context with respect to both legal and technological requirements, and how well current explainability methods adhere to this definition.

This thesis sets out to create a novel, layered definition of explanations with respect to artificial intelligence and the General Data Protection Directive, and set this definition out against current popular post-hoc explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP. This analysis will be used to identify current gaps in both the formulation of the law and the delivery of explanations by these methods."
"""Move on Up"" - Exploring Later-Life Residential Mobility in the Netherlands between 2015-2020","['Bruins, Hsiung Ming']","['Smit, Martijn']",2023-01-01T03:01:02Z,EN,['Regression analysis; Later-life residential behaviour; Human Geography'],Human Geography,"The issues involving the increasingly ageing (Dutch) population have progressively become a body of interest of policy makers, and academics. This unprecedented situation of having more elderly does not only pressurises contemporary healthcare systems, but also the mobility in the housing market. The older adults, people aged 55 years and above, tend to have relatively the lowest residential mobility of all age groups. This Master’s thesis will delve into which (contextual) factors contribute to older adults’ propensity to relocate, and what is hampering prone to relocate older adults to realize their move in the 2015-2020 period. These limitations unveil a discrepancy in terms of what older adults intended to do (stated preference), and their actual residential behaviour (revealed preference). 
In short, this research is inspired by, and tries to build further on, previous studies executed on stated preference (Meskers, 2020), revealed preference (Van der Pers et al., 2015), and the discrepancy between stated and revealed preference (De Groot et al., 2008). 

This has resulted into the formulation of the central research question:  
‘To what extent is there a discrepancy between stated preference and revealed preference in terms of relocation of older adults  in the Netherlands during 2015-2020, and what is the influence of triggering factors (especially intergenerational proximity, widowhood, and health) on the propensity of older adults to relocate, and probability to realize their relocation intention?

To answer this research question, logistic regression analyses have been applied using longitudinal data from the Housing Research Netherlands (HRN), and the Social Statistical Database (SSD). The HRN 2015 dataset consists of detailed information about 73660 respondents in the Netherlands. In 2015, these individuals were interviewed about their housing situation at the time, their propensity to move, and their residential preferences in the nearby future. The HRN 2015 was even further enriched with socio-economic information, such as for example income. Combining the HRN 2015 with the SSD register data, following the methods of De Groot et al. (2008), resulted in the possibility to follow respondents residential behaviour between the 2015-2020 period.  
Thanks to the support of Companen (Advisory Bureau for the Housing Market and Residential Environment) and Statistics Netherlands (CBS), this data became available for this research. 

The research in itself can be divided into roughly two parts:
Firstly, by creating a multinomial logistic regression model (Model A), the influence of factors (i.e., variables) driving older adults’ propensity to relocate (stated preference) has been estimated. Secondly, with the construction of the binary logistic regression Models B1 and B2, the influence of factors on the probability of realizing a relocation (revealed preference) has been calculated. 

Concluding, the central research question cannot be answered in simple terms. Older adults’ stated and revealed residential preferences have been proven to be complex, as the interplay between the numerous factors influencing these preferences is not completely straightforward. Nonetheless, this Master’s thesis has ascertained the special role of older adults’ attachment to their dwelling. This attachment keeps these older adults, whether they intended to relocate or not in 2015, from realizing a relocation. This attachment could consist of having family and friends living nearby, accumulated memories over the decades, having little financial issues, which combined could result in a low urgency to relocate."
Current understanding of the role of inflammasome activation in the pathophysiology of systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,"['Pappot, Anouk']","['Loosdregt, Jorg van']",2023-01-01T03:01:04Z,EN,['Inflammasomes; sJIA; systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis; NLRP1; NLRP3; NLRC4; AIM2; pyrin; S100A12; S100A8/A9; macrophage activation syndrome'],Infection and Immunity,"Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) is a severe disease with autoinflammatory characteristics that mainly affects young children. It is characterised by systemic inflammation and fever. sJIA patients have elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-18 with elevated levels of S100A8/A9, S100A12, and the acute-phase protein ferritin. Approximately 10% of the children with sJIA also develop the life-threatening complication macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which comes with fever and very high levels of ferritin. sJIA patients are treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and biologicals that block the IL-1 and IL-6 pathway. The exact cause of the disease remains unknown but the inflammasome likely plays an important role in the pathophysiology. IL-1β and IL-18 both are products of an activated inflammasome and S100A8/A9, S100A12, and ferritin are associated with inflammasome activation. Furthermore, gain-of-function mutations in the nucleotide-binding domain of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) containing 4 (NLRC4) inflammasome are associated with MAS. This review focuses on the current understanding of the possible role of the five best understood inflammasomes (NLR pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1), NLRP3, NLRC4, absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), and pyrin) in the pathophysiology of sJIA. This knowledge is important for future research into the treatment and possible prevention of sJIA. Direct research into the role of the different inflammasomes in sJIA is scarce and therefore the symptoms, cytokine expression and treatments of monogenic autoinflammatory disorders as a comparison to sJIA will also be used to determine the likelihood of the involvement of the respective inflammasome in sJIA pathophysiology. Data of studies focussing on inflammasomes in sJIA and the comparisons with inflammasomopathies, indicate that the NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasome are most likely involved in the pathophysiology of sJIA."
Reconstructing ocean conditions and latitudinal migration of oceanic fronts offshore Tasmania during the mid-Pliocene using high-resolution dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from IODP Site 1168A.,"['Toebrock, Leonie']","['Bijl, Peter']",2023-01-01T03:00:57Z,EN,['Dinocyst; M2 glaciation; paleoceanography; Mid-Pliocene warm period'],"Earth, Life and Climate","The mid-Pliocene was characterised by a warm climate with similar CO2 concentrations to today but higher sea levels which suggests a contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. This warm climate was disrupted by the transient M2 glaciation at 3.3 Ma before returning to warmer conditions during the mPWP (3.264 Ma). This glaciation has generally been seen as a Northern Hemisphere glaciation, but recent studies have shown evidence that the Antarctic Ice Sheet must have been more affected by warming and cooling during the Pliocene. Uncertainties remain on how large that glaciation was and what the ocean conditions around Antarctica were before 3.3 Ma. The Southern Ocean is strongly latitudinally banded, which is indicated by the 3 Southern Ocean fronts. Glacial-interglacial climate variability strongly moves those latitudinal bands north and south. Changes in the configuration of the Antarctic Ice Sheet impact the latitudinal location of these fronts, as they are linked through sea ice season. To better understand how ocean conditions in the Southern Ocean changed in association with the mPWP and the M2 glaciation, we use dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from Site 1168, on the western margin of Tasmania, to reconstruct latitudinal Subtropical Front movement. We found a significant dinocyst assemblage change across the M2 glaciation. Before and after the M2, the dinocyst assemblage was dominated by O. centrocarpum which is indicative of a position north of the STF, while during the M2, there was a transient N. labyrinthus assemblage dominance which is indicative for a position south of the STF. Such an assemblage change indicates a migration of the STF, of around 3-4° latitude. Thus, we infer that the Antarctic Ice Sheet must have been more dynamic in the mid-Pliocene than previously assumed. Based on the observed latitudinal migration of the Subtropical Front, the Antarctic ice sheet must have extended and decreased across the Pliocene. In addition, by comparing with biomarker-based SST, we found an offset between changing SST and the maximum response of the dinocyst assemblage which can be linked to influxes of freshwater during the deglaciation of the M2 affecting the maximum relative abundance of certain species. Overall, our data proved that the Antarctic ice sheet was more sensitive to the variable Pliocene climate."

Dijkstra argues that the new law proposal will enhance the autonomy of elderly people with a wish to die without unbearable suffering. The way autonomy is approached portrays a focus on rationality, independence, self-consideration and individual choice. In the past decades relational lines of critique have been developed against the traditional approach of autonomy, introducing a relational understanding of autonomy. These approaches try to incorporate emotions, relationships, embedded selves and the asynchronous nature of autonomy. Dijkstra also implements the notion of relational autonomy in her proposal, adopting the term from the 2016 report by the committee of Independent Experts directed by prof. dr; Paul Schnabel. She also builds on insights found in the 2020 Perspective research directed by van Wijngaarden. I build my arguments mostly on accounts of relational autonomy by Gómez, de Maeseneer and Gastmans., Walter and Friedman Ross, Winzelberg, Hanson, Tulksy and Baumann. I introduce three arguments: firstly, the dependence argument in which I argue that A) being dependent is not a threat for autonomy and B) making an autonomous choice cannot be done completely independently. Secondly, I present the ambiguity argument in which I argue that A) the proposal overestimates rationality and reason and B) overlooks the ambiguity of the decision-making process. Thirdly, I present the contextual argument in which I argue that A) the proposal only incorporates relational autonomy in an accidental way and B) incorporates relational autonomy in an instrumental way. In the end I conclude that, while Dijkstra tries to incorporate relational insights on autonomy, she does not sufficiently do so."
A Novel Sensory Pre-Conditioning Paradigm to Assess Inferential Fear Generalization,"['Demir, Umay']","['Gerlicher, Anna']",2023-01-15T01:00:50Z,EN,['inferential fear generalization; sensory pre-conditioning; higher-order inference; spontaneous experience replay'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Fear generalization is a survival mechanism that helps us predict threat and adjust our responses to potentially dangerous stimuli. Thus, through fear generalization, the fear response can transfer from the original threat predictor to other stimuli. Even though adaptive, over-generalization of fear is the hallmark of anxiety disorders; thus, studying its underlying processes is essential for both preventing and treating anxiety-related disorders. Prior research shows that fear generalization may also occur in cases where there is no direct pairing between the threat predictor and the threat itself. A high-order inference is required for this kind of generalization. A possible underlying mechanism in the human brain for this inference process is “spontaneous experience replay."" This process takes time, requires cognitive resources, and as a result, the replay allows the attribution of previously learned associations to new stimuli. However, inferential generalization within the context of fear has not yet been explored. To address this gap, we developed a three-phase sensory preconditioning paradigm exploring inferential fear generalization. Additionally, previous research found that childhood trauma impairs fear learning. However, its relationship with inferential fear generalization has never been explored. Thus, this study aimed to 1) establish a novel sensory pre-conditioning paradigm and investigate whether we could interfere with the revaluation necessary for inferential fear generalization by manipulating cognitive load 2) examine whether there was a correlation between childhood trauma and inferential fear generalization. The results suggest that the paradigm did not lead to fear generalization. Even though there was successful fear conditioning, there was no retention of the fear during the first trial of the test phase, which may have caused the lack of generalization. Also, there was no correlation between childhood trauma and fear generalization, which could have been due to the absence of fear generalization. In summary, our study was the first to use a sensory preconditioning paradigm with sequences to explore inferential fear generalization, allowing us to measure how much fear generalizes to stimuli inside the sequence. It was also the first study to look at how cognitive load affected this process and if inferential fear generalization was connected to childhood trauma. Thus, this study lays the groundwork on which future inferential fear generalization studies can be improved upon."
Involvement of the alPFC in electroencephalographic processes that underlie fear processing and fear downregulation: a TMS-EEG study,"['Boor, Marián']","['Kenemans, J.L.']",2023-01-14T01:00:47Z,EN,[],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Layman’s Summary:
After a threat has disappeared, it is necessary to downregulate fear to prevent chronic anxiety. A frontal brain area called the anterolateral prefrontal cortex (alPFC) has been found to be involved in regulating emotional behavior and downregulating fear. Studies that record electrical brain activity have found that brainwaves in the theta range (4 to 8 Hz) measured in the frontal middle brain areas are associated with fear processing. Theta brainwaves measured in these locations have been found to originate in a brain region called the dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC), which is involved in fear expression. However, theta brainwaves originating in the alPFC have been found to be involved in the process of regulating social emotional behavior. In our study, we used brain stimulation that decreases the activity in the targeted brain area. By targeting the alPFC, we can directly study the causal involvement of this brain area in downregulating fear and the underlying electrical activity involved in this process. We recruited 30 healthy participants that completed a task, in which they were instructed that they may receive an electric shock when they are presented with one cue (threat cue), whereas they would never receive an electric shock when presented with another cue (safe cue). Against our expectations, we did not find any effect of the brain stimulation on theta brainwaves. During the presentation of the cue, there was no difference between the threatening and the safe cue in the theta brainwaves. However, we did find a difference between these conditions in slower brainwave band called delta (0.5 to 4 Hz). The threatening condition induced stronger delta brainwaves than the safe condition. Delta brainwaves have been found to play a role in emotional processing and therefore, the stronger delta during threatening versus the safe cue can be explained by stronger emotional processing elicited by the threatening stimulus. After the cue disappeared, we did find a difference between the threatening and the safe cue in theta brainwaves, with the threatening condition having stronger theta waves than the safe condition. However, it is unclear whether this theta increase represents the process of fear downregulation, or the ongoing process of fear expression elicited by the preceding threat cue. Moreover, it is not clear whether the lack of effect of the brain stimulation on theta brainwaves was observed because the stimulated region (alPFC) was insufficiently involved in fear processing, or the decreased alPFC activity caused by the stimulation was not captured by brainwaves, or if the effect of cTBS on the brain was too weak."
Material Flow Analysis of Wood in a Self-Sufficient Community,"['Cammack, Claudia']","['Verweij, Pita']",2023-01-15T00:00:34Z,EN,['material flow analysis; self-sufficient community; circularity; wood flow; future-proof'],Environmental Biology,"Wood is an essential natural resource that can be utilized in various ways, such as for construction, bioenergy, and paper production. The flow of wood from harvest to use has the potential to be optimized to achieve circularity and enhance sustainability through proper management and increased recycling rates. This objective is particularly interesting to “Orchid City,” a concept for a future-proof, self-sufficient community of up to 50,000 inhabitants. A material flow analysis was therefore conducted for Orchid City to determine whether the community could self-sustain its wood consumption based on own wood production. The recycling rates of the wood flow were evaluated to determine if efficiencies in the system could be increased to enhance the circularity of the wood. Next, recommendations were made for which tree species to grow and where the wood should be produced. The cascade-use principle of wood was evaluated to determine which order of uses is most efficient. Finally, the feasibility of an Orchid City in the Netherlands was evaluated in terms of geographical location and spatial requirements. This report concludes that an Orchid City of 50,000 inhabitants (occupying 19,700 ha in total) can be self-sufficient in terms of wood, given increases in efficiencies within the recycling system. The total amount of wood that needs to be produced is 24,275 tonnes per year and Orchid city exceeds this amount by 4,686 tonnes. The corresponding land claim, needed to fulfill these growth requirements is 2,410 ha for natural forest, 2,994 ha for agroforestry, and 9,039 ha for silvopasture. From a wood flow perspective, it is feasible that such a community could be placed in certain areas of the Netherlands with similar land use regimes and low population densities. However, further research is needed to consider more complex issues and potential constraints to implementation, such as land tenure and regulation, and current high land prices."

However, in the current CE concept, the social dimension of sustainability is marginally considered. Here, circular social enterprises (SEs) can play a role in integrating the social dimension in the CE concept to foster a socially just CE, as they prioritise their social objectives. Therefore, this research examined the strategies through which circular SEs can foster a socially just CE. In particular, this research used an environmental justice perspective (including procedural, recognitional and distributive justice) to identify the social issues and injustices in the CE. Moreover, the research looked into the differences in the employed strategies between three SE types, the entrepreneurial non profit, social cooperative and the social business, as the features that address the social issues manifest differently in these SEs. A comparative case study was therefore employed, analysing twelve SEs based on 24 interviews and 56 archival data sources.
The results emphasise that the circular SEs can address all three dimensions of environmental justice 
holistically through five of their main features. First, the circular SEs utilise their economic surplus for environmental and social impact, reconceptualising surplus (distributive justice). Moreover, the economic surplus can be reinvested by the circular SEs in potential environmental injustices in the CE, fostering a socially just CE. Moreover, the circular SEs embody behavioural, financial, educational and technological accessibility through four different strategies (addressing distributive justice), namely: explicitly integrating accessibility in their social mission, providing (circular) capabilities to socially excluded groups, adopting technological accessibility in their business model and including access to CE information. Especially the entrepreneurial non-profits were found to include access to CE information through their adaptive and accessible approach to CE education. Furthermore, the democratisation of decision-making processes and the actualisation of good working conditions are strategies identified concerning the participatory governance of the circular SEs (procedural justice). The social cooperative adopts the democratization of decision-making processes most effectively due to their decision-making structures. Furthermore, the circular SEs aim to empower socially excluded groups and realise an inclusive environment to increase social inclusion in the CE, addressing recognitional justice. Lastly, the circular SEs socially embed their SE in the local community through increasing community engagement to address recognitional justice. The strategies identified by the results provide relevant insights for CE literature and practitioners aiming for a socially just CE."

IN SILICO TOOLS TO PRIORITIZE TRANSFORMATION PRODUCTS OF PESTICIDES ORIGINATING FROM DRINKING WATER TREATMENTS: S-METOLACHLOR AS A PROOF OF PRINCIPLE","['Ferrario, Adele']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-01-11T01:01:00Z,EN,"['in silico tools, transformation products, drinking water treatments, predictive toxicology']",Toxicology and Environmental Health,"Environmental contaminants are present in water sources, so drinking water treatments are applied. However, these contaminants can be transformed into new chemicals – called transformation products (TPs) – often unknown and undetected by analytical techniques (Gogoi et al., 2018; Brunner et al., 2019; Zahn et al., 2019; Menger et al., 2021). Therefore, predicting TPs' formation during drinking water treatments must be addressed (Kiefer et al., 2019). At the same time, predictive toxicology can help identify TPs of great toxicological concern and steer further analysis. However, there is an urge to assemble available methods to design and implement the next-generation risk assessment (NGRA) in regulatory frameworks (Pallocca et al., 2022). Therefore, this research focused on developing a rational scheme for predicting TPs formation because of drinking water treatments, their physicochemical characteristics (PCC), and toxicological hazards. The effectiveness of freely available in silico tools in predicting, prioritizing, and evaluating TPs was discussed here. S-metolachlor TPs were used as proof of the applicability of the methodology. The reliability of the methods varies depending on the specific reaction pathway, PCC, or endpoint considered. The Chemical Transformation Simulator (CTS) and enviPath were demonstrated to be the best available combination for predicting TPs originating from drinking water treatments. EpiSuiteTM was recommended for the PCC evaluation, and VEGA QSAR for the hazard prioritization. Whether the predicted prioritized S-metolachlor TPs could represent a human health risk via drinking water or an environmental concern for their impact on ecosystems requires further research, as well as the development of an automation workflow for the use of the applied in silico tools, is required."
A Qualitative Analysis of Customer Use Behaviour in Mobility Sector Product Service Systems,"['Cohen, Jauke']","['Tunn, Vivian']",2023-01-11T01:01:04Z,EN,['Product Service Systems; customer use behaviour; careful behaviour; careless behaviour; Theory of Planned Behaviour; Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour; Norm Activation Model.'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Due to increased competition and environmental pressure, many companies today are striving to offer value-adding Product Service Systems (PSS) in addition to their current business. Through the implementation of PSS, circularity of businesses can be improved. However, customer misbehaviour is a frequently returning concept within these relatively new business models. Therefore this research stresses the following research question: why do consumers treat products they use through Product Service Systems with or without care? To answer this question this research takes a qualitative approach and combines three mayor theories in behavioural studies namely, the Theory of Planned Behaviour, the Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour, and the Norm Activation Model. Furthermore, this research analyses 15 semi-structured interviews with customers that use mobility focussed PSSs. The results provide insights into the connections between the determinants and the most important determinants of careful and careless behaviour. Next, these findings provide practical insights for PSS companies for focus points when wanting to improve their customers use behaviour. The main findings suggest that the subjective norm has a big influence on both careful and careless use behaviour, as family and nurture are big influences of careful use behaviour. Customer connection is an important aspect for users in terms of their level of carefully or carelessly using the product. Moreover, subjective norm often returns in careless use behaviour, as friends have the power to change careful habitual behaviour to careless use behaviour. These careful habitual actions often relate to personal precautions of being able to use the product in a later stage of usage. Prominent facilitating conditions for careful behaviour are; knowledge about the product, age of the user, condition of the product, and the subjective norm. Biggest influences of facilitating conditions leading to careless behaviour are; (lack of) knowledge about the product, lack of interest by the company, condition of the product, and alcohol consumption. Suggestions for further research include gaining theoretical insights with the integral model in mobility focussed PSS, and additionally capturing insights with this model in other types of PSSs. Moreover, it might be interesting to observe use behaviour in PSSs, as one of the major limitations of this behavioural study is the fact that the behaviour is questioned to the customer directly."
Understanding how the hydrogen technological innovation system in the Netherlands can be accelerated,"['Broekstra, Bas']","['Negro, Simona']",2023-01-11T01:00:57Z,EN,"['Innovation system, hydrogen, innovation barriers, systemic problems']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"To meet climate targets and avoid radical and irreversible climate change, society needs to drastically reduce Green House Gas emissions. This requires to transit away from the current fossil-fuel-based energy system to meet targets for greenhouse emissions set out in the European Green Deal (2019). In this respect, hydrogen technologies have the potential to fulfill a variety of different functions in the energy system. Hydrogen solutions have emerged as having favorable characteristics for certain applications. These characteristics include specific sectors in which electricity can not be applied or for long-term energy storage. For the latter application, electricity is currently restricted by limitations in battery technology. Therefore, the development of a hydrogen value chain is regarded as a valuable addition to electricity in the energy transition. In the Netherlands, this potential of hydrogen has been acknowledged for decades, as the country has extensive natural gas infrastructure and experience with power in the form of gas. However, the hydrogen innovation system in the country remains in a state of lock-in for a long time and only recently accelerated as a result of external shocks such as climate change. The Technological Innovation System (TIS) framework has been applied as the theoretical basis to analyze the hydrogen transition. This study aimed to investigate the dynamics in the hydrogen innovation system hampering its development and to recommend how this can be overcome. In doing so, this study exposed different barriers that may prevent the hydrogen system from developing. These barriers have been linked to the theory of systemic problems, to fully understand how the innovation processes and structural components of the system are connected. Accordingly, this study has conducted a qualitative event-history analysis from 2017-2022, in combination with interviews with hydrogen innovation system actors. The results indicated several barriers which are present and which are withholding the system from accelerated development. First, this study has demonstrated that hard-institutional failures are the main barrier. The supporting institutional frameworks needed for the system to develop lack clarity, are absent, or do not support system development. Secondly, these problems induce barriers to resource mobilization and market formation, which prevent the system from developing into the next phase. Like previous studies, this paper has demonstrated that these systemic problems are not independent and induce a hampering innovation system. This is induced through the interactions between system functions or missing structural components."
The potential of fungi to improve surface water quality in Amsterdam: a review,"['Franssen, Godelieve']","['Wosten, Han']",2023-01-12T01:00:46Z,EN,['Mycoremediation; fungal filter; surface water quality; European Water Framework Directive; wastewater treatment'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"This review presents the most important pollutants in the surface waters of Amsterdam and
an overview of studies that assessed the removal of these pollutants from water by fungi.
Amsterdam functions as a case study for the Netherlands in general, a country that is among
the lowest in the European ranking on water quality. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and
present in excessive amounts in Dutch surface water, exceeding the norms set by the 2027
European Water Framework Directive (EWFD) in the majority of the water bodies. To reach
the norms, measures have to be taken in the coming years. Mycoremediation seems to be
a promising, cost-effective measure, which can be implemented in water treatment plants
to prevent pollutants to flush to the surface water. From the EWFD pollutants, three types
of metals, seven types of PAHs, the biocide tributyltin cation, and fertilizers ammonium and
phosphate were found to be the most problematic pollutants in Amsterdam canals. Nearly all
metals and PAHs were shown to be effectively removed by different types of fungi, especially
white-rot fungi such as Pleurotus ostreatus. The majority of the metals was removed with a
removal rate of >95%. Other pollutants that are not included in the EWFD but are regarded
as abundant in Amsterdam canals are drug residues and Eschecheria coli. Nearly all of
these were shown to be effectively removed by fungi. T. versicolor showed to be the most
effective species to remove drug residues (up to 100% removal rate) and P. ostreatus to remove
E. coli (up to 99.7%) from wastewater. The majority of these pollutants were studied in
mycoremediation research in both lab conditions as well as using real wastewater. The step
towards implementation of mycoremediation is therefore relatively small, and could be realised
within years. It is highly recommended to start testing these techniques in wastewater
treatment plants in Amsterdam, so that pollutant levels in their effluents can be minimized."

The analysis in the first chapter reveals that, under democratic rule, Mali was heavily reliant on foreign assistance and colonial mechanisms such as French control over the country's policy decisions. From a postcolonial standpoint, it is then asserted that Mali's transition from democracy to competitive authoritarianism has been accompanied by a vehement rejection of colonial frameworks in the nation's foreign policy. This is how Mali exhibits African agency; its post-coup d'état foreign policy is marked by an independent posture.  Malians' support for the current foreign policy of the country, explains the legitimacy of the present administration. The most prevalent understanding of the country's geopolitical situation among Malians supports this assertion. Namely, one that is still making an effort to extricate itself from imperial systems. Moreover, it is noted that Mali is more suited to cooperating with authoritarian states like Russia, Turkey, and China. This bolstered Mali's commitment to African agency in the nation's foreign policy by providing the country with the resources it needs to avoid dependence on France or any other postcolonial, imperial structure."

To study how technologies like green hydrogen develop and diffuse, the Technological Innovation Systems approach is often used. To incorporate the role of external factors as well as regional differences on technological development on a national scale, this research compares the contextual structures of the regions of the Northern Netherlands and Rotterdam-Moerdijk. The findings show that both regions have specific context conditions that influence the national green hydrogen Technological Innovation System in the Netherlands. The Northern Netherlands’ existing natural gas infrastructure, proactive regional governments and geographical characteristics mean that initiatives along the entire green hydrogen value chain are developed. In Rotterdam-Moerdijk, large industrial actors, existing infrastructure and economic connections with other regions make it suitable for initial market creation and an important future green hydrogen transit region. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the influence of regional contextual structures on national technological innovation systems is strongly considered, both in academics and in policymaking."

Aboveground carbon stock showed near exponential growth after 5 years of establishment. The inclusion of hedgerow measurements has greatly increased the estimated carbon stock of young foor forests. Belowground variables were strongly related to soil type, but not to food forest age. A best-fit model analysis highlights the role of age, soil type and plant available sodium for the development of the aboveground carbon stock."
Endothelial cell viability and histology as parameters for ex-vivo mouse heart perfusion system optimization.,"['Berkhoff, Wendy']","['Kessler, Elise']",2023-01-19T01:00:53Z,EN,"['ex-vivo mouse heart perfusion; normothermic machine perfusion, heart preservation; endothelial cell viability; perfusion solution; colloids; histology; ischemia; hypertrophy']",Biology of Disease,"Heart failure is a main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. To reduce the disparity between 
the waiting list and available donor hearts, extended criteria donor hearts are an alternative, because 
the development of ex-vivo heart perfusion in many countries has led to utilisation of extended criteria 
donor organs recently. Compared to SCS and hypothermic machine perfusion, normothermic machine 
perfusion provides a higher protective capacity, a superior prediction of the early graft function, and 
more accurate assessment of donor heart functionality. Importantly, the endothelium should also be 
considered specifically when optimising preservation solutions. In this work, mouse hearts were 
perfused in KHB solution at normothermic temperature. Histology and microscopy analysis revealed 
no statistically significant differences in SWT, AWT, and LVWA when comparing different perfusion 
times and switching from Langendorff to working perfusion mode. In addition, the degree of ischemia 
was lowest after 15-20 minutes of Langendorff perfusion and increased with 2-hour Langendorff 
perfusion, but fluctuated afterwards, suggesting that ischemia is a dynamic process. Furthermore, no
statistically significant differences were found in AWT and LVWA for mouse hearts exposed to low 
oxygen levels in the KHB solution compared to high oxygen levels. However, a statistically significant 
higher SWT was observed in mouse hearts exposed to a low oxygen level compared to the hearts 
exposed to a high oxygen level. A higher oxygen level seems to preserve mouse hearts better. 
Moreover, the average cardiomyocyte size showed no statistically significant difference between 
mouse hearts exposed to either high or low oxygen levels. After performing flow cytometry and dataanalysis, no statistically significant difference in HMEC-1 cell viability was found when exposed to cold 
preservation solution St Thomas cardioplegia, although an indication might be found for the cells to 
be not affected during the different incubation periods. Using the RTCA xCELLigence system (Roche) 
to determine the viability of HMEC-1 cells over time when exposed to different colloids and different 
perfusion fluids, showed that albumin might be the preferred colloid and KHB seem to preserve the 
viability better than Steen solution based on the experimental data. To conclude, the results suggest 
that better preservation could be achieved with normothermic perfusion of mouse hearts in an ex-vivo
heart perfusion system at high oxygen level compared to a low oxygen level. Moreover, ischemia for 
perfusion system optimisation may be important to consider. Furthermore, from the in-vitro
experiments can be concluded that the viability of endothelial cells might not be affected over different 
incubation periods with St Thomas cardioplegia. Also, albumin may be preferred over the artificial 
colloids when only considering the experimental results, although for determining whether KHB or 
Steen solution is more optimal as perfusate on the system, additional experiments are necessary."

Cancer immunotherapy, including cancer vaccines, adoptive T-cell therapy, oncolytic virotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor therapy, has showcased promising treatment effects for many solid tumours and is currently explored for pediatric GBM treatment, as well. Patient response to immunotherapy is closely related to the composition of the tumour microenvironment and its immune components. Therefore, preclinical tumour models incorporating constituents of the tumour immune microenvironment (TIME) are essential as platforms for testing immunotherapy. For the testing and development of immunotherapeutic and other drug treatments for brain tumours, the treatment needs to cross the Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB). In-vitro models of the BBB can be used to assess BBB permeability for a specific drug.

The role of the rat prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) in action selection and extinction,"['Kok, Bart']","['Meye, Frank']",2023-01-19T01:01:00Z,EN,['Prelimbic;Infralimbic;PL;IL;Action Selection;Neuroscience;Behavioural Neuroscience;Rat;Go/No-Go;Extinction;PFC;DREADD;CNO;SalB'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"The prefrontal cortex is thought to be highly involved in the process of selecting situation appropriate actions. In the rat PFC, a functional dichotomy has been proposed, where the infralimbic cortex (IL) inhibits actions, and the prelimbic cortex (PL) promotes action. However, this dichotomy has been challenged by multiple studies suggesting that both IL and PL encode context appropriate behaviour and inhibit situation inappropriate behaviour. Further research is needed to understand the role of  IL and PL in guiding action selection. Therefore, in this study, we use a Go/No-Go rat model to investigate the role of the IL and PL in action selection. The Go/No-Go task was designed so animals had to either initiate an or inhibit action, based on cues that signal situation appropriate action to earn a reward. We perturbated IL, PL and IL + PL using two Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), in order to understand their role in the Go/No-Go behavioural paradigm. This experimental set-up allowed us to investigate the role of the IL and PL in selecting situation appropriate actions and inhibiting situation inappropriate actions. Additionally, it allowed us to investigate the role of the IL in extinction learning, by extinction of the Go response. Following the hypothesized functional dichotomy, one would expect inhibition of PL to result in a worse Go performance, and inhibition of IL to result in a worse No-Go performance. Thereby, given the role of the IL in inhibition of inappropriate action, IL inhibition was expected to negatively affect extinction learning. We observed that Go performance was significantly affected, while sparing No-Go performance, especially after inhibition of both IL and PL. Decreased Go performance seemed to be caused by an impaired ability of the animals to flexibly change behaviour while making a nose-poke response, suggesting that action initiation was impaired due to perturbation of these two regions. However, several limitations in this study complicated interpretation of our results: The effects on our behavioural measurements of the two drugs used to inhibit the two regions differed, general movement deficits due to inhibition of IL and PL seem to confound our observations and histological analysis is not completed yet. These limitations should be tackled in a follow-up study in order to find out what the effects of IL and PL inhibition are on behaviour in the Go/No-Go task."

Pioneers in sustainable design have seen its potential in expanding the possibilities and then dived into researching specific materials– biomaterials. Besides the scientific academia, designers have also used it to develop products further. It combines standard design tools and organisms that can be grown accumulatively. Designers have met multiple challenges in this fresh approach, especially when it confronts designers' customs and when product development is the intention. To deal with this problem, the values brought out by biofabrication are proposed to be understood and contemplated more, especially those hidden under the ecological effects, for instance, their original characteristics designed by Nature, the connectivity with society and human needs that trigger consumers' activity. By further diving deep into the integration, designers can exert their influence and create meaningful embodiments that contribute to sustainability in a broader context."

Various addiction models have been designed to capture loss of control over substance seeking, by associating operant responding for a substance with aversive stimuli such as foot shocks. We recently developed the seeking under the threat of adversity (STA) task to assess adversity in a manner that better resembles the human scenario. In the STA task, active seeking responses, during the presentation of a cue tone, lead to a 25% chance of receiving a foot shock.
The aim of this study was to assess whether rats lose control over substance seeking for sucrose, alcohol, and cocaine in the STA task. Moreover, we aimed to assess whether individual differences in alcohol intake predict loss of control over seeking. 
The rats were trained to respond for sucrose and alcohol in an operant task. They were first trained on a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule and then on random interval (RI) schedules of reinforcement, with increasing interval lengths (5 to 120s). Then, the rats were tested for control over substance use in the STA task. The rats in the alcohol batch consumed alcohol in an Intermittent Alcohol Access (IAA) setup for 2 months prior to training. Based on the level of alcohol intake, the rats were divided into low (LD) and high (HD) alcohol drinking rats. The rats in the cocaine batch underwent two sets of 10 STA sessions interspersed with extended sessions of cocaine self-administration to induce cocaine dependence.
A significant and consistent suppression of sucrose seeking was observed over 14 consecutive STA sessions compared to baseline sessions. This denotes that the rats did not develop loss of control over sucrose seeking. For alcohol, we observed differential responding in the STA task for HD and LD animals. Alcohol and cocaine show decreased levels of baseline responding compared to sucrose, but also decreased suppression of responses during the task. This is indicative of loss of control for these substances and is captured by the STA task. Therefore, this model can be a great tool to investigate the neurobiological correlates of SUD, leading to improved treatment strategies in the future."

onderwijsinterventie bestond uit een e-learning cursus en een discussiebijeenkomst. De uitkomst was de
discrepantie tussen OTC medicijnen geregistreerd door artsen in het medisch dossier en het 
daadwerkelijke gebruik van OTC medicijnen door patiënten. De gegevens werden geanalyseerd door 
middel van een chi-kwadraat toets in SPSS om het medisch dossier van patiënten in de interventiegroep 
te vergelijken met de patiënten in de controlegroep.

Resultaten
Er werden 775 patiënten in deze studie opgenomen. Het totale aantal OTC-geneesmiddelen dat bij deze 
patiënten werd gevonden, bedroeg 1245. Van de 1245 OTC-geneesmiddelen waren er slechts 70 (5.6%) 
gedocumenteerd in het medisch dossier. Van de 70 OTC-geneesmiddelen waren 41 (58.6%) afkomstig uit 
de interventiegroep en 29 (41.4%) uit de controlegroep. Er werd geen statistisch significant verschil 
gevonden tussen beide groepen in de documentatiegraad (p=0.51). 

Conclusie
De intensieve educatieve interventie had geen effect op de documentatiegraad van OTC-geneesmiddelen 
door artsen. Er werd geen verschil gevonden tussen de interventiegroep en de controlegroep wat betreft 
de documentatie van OTC-geneesmiddelen. De totale documentatie van OTC-geneesmiddelen was laag in 
beide groepen."
"The potential of diversification in coffee systems to enhance coffee productivity, biological pest control services and pollination services: a systematic review","['Pollmann, Umi']","['Mancini Teixeira, Heitor']",2023-01-24T01:00:44Z,EN,"['agroforestry, coffee, pollination services, pest control services, productivity']",Sustainable Development,"Although agricultural productivity of coffee farms has increased, the accompanying biodiversity decline increases reliance on external inputs. The addition of trees, shrubs and other plants in farms can contributes to biodiversity conservation by creating a viable habitat for wildlife. Yet, there is still limited understanding of the effect of plant diversity in coffee systems, when taking into account the possible trade-offs, synergies and additive effects between coffee productivity, biological pest control and pollination services associated with diversification. This study reviews the strength and type of interactions between the beforementioned clusters also considering the effect of the altitudinal gradient. A systematic review was conducted to quantify these interactions between selected indicators for each cluster (n = 77 studies). The study level data was summarized and used to make path diagram giving insight on the strength of the interactions. Linear mixed-effect models were used to analyse plot data on the effect of plant diversity on coffee productivity as well as biological pest control and pollination services. 
The strongest positive correlations found in the path diagram are between the biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services and coffee productivity. Furthermore, findings indicate that a positive correlation of medium strength exists between biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services and plant diversity. Coffee productivity has a weak negative correlation with plant diversity and altitude is not found to impact pest control services nor productivity from study level data. 
In addition, plant diversity, coffee productivity and biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services are interconnected through multiple additive effects and through a trade-off between coffee productivity and biological pest control services. Both study and plot data indicates that increased plant diversity in coffee systems have an additive positive effect on biological pest control and pollination services. Plot data indicates that these services are enhanced respectively through an increase in taxonomical and structural diversity. A trade-off exists, however, between the positive response of the abundance of natural enemies and the negative response of coffee productivity to increased taxonomical diversity. Moreover, a negative additive effect was found for altitude on biological pest control and pollination services through the analysis of plot data.
The findings can be used to inform the sustainable management of coffee systems; increased plant diversity in farms is found to increase biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide. However, 
taxonomical diversity is demonstrated to have a direct negative impact on coffee productivity."
Sea level rise projections from storylines of Antarctic ice shelf collapse and its implication for adaptive planning in the Netherlands,"['Herpen, Daan van']","['Wal, Roderik van de']",2023-01-26T01:00:46Z,EN,['adaptive planning; deep uncertainty; sea level rise; sea level rise projections; Antarctica; ice shelves; Dutch coast; buttressing; IMAU-ICE'],Climate Physics,"In this study we model the dynamic sea level rise that results when Antarctica losses a substantial part of its buttressing ice shelves. To assess the timing of this loss, we perform a separate stability analysis that incorporates both oceanic and atmospheric forcings. We conclude that both the magnitude and the timing of larger scale sea level rise from Antarctic ice shelf collapse is principally controlled by the ocean-induced thinning but that atmospheric forcings have the ability to slightly expedite the moment of collapse. We further assess that larger scale ice shelf collapse is unlikely before the early second half of the 21st century, and
that the resultant dynamic sea level rise will become important in the mid- to late second half of this same century. We find that the uncertainty caused by the variation between the ice sheet models is more than twice as large as the uncertainty caused by the triggers for ice shelf collapse. These findings suggest that if we want to better curtail the sea level rise uncertainty from a large dynamic contribution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, curbing - or at least attributing - variations between ice sheet models is more important than the development of better predictions for the sub-shelf melting. We confirm that a long-term perspective on sea level rise can help policy makers to overcome decision paralysis on the short- to mid-term. Indeed, when Antarctic ice shelf collapse becomes a distinct possibility, it is likely not a matter of if and how to adapt to certain levels of sea level rise, but when to adapt. Flexible measures with a short lead- and lifetime can play a role in the adaptive strategy, but are inferior to larger measures for an extreme sea level rise scenario like the one considered here, or when taking on a long-term perspective."
Exploring a siamese neural network as a novel individual cow identification technique for daily monitoring free water intake.,"['Herwijnen, Daniël van']","['Hostens, Miel']",2023-01-24T01:00:52Z,EN,['similarity learning;siamese neural network;free water intake;water consumption dairy cows'],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"A dairy cow needs enough water to produce good quality milk. Over the last decades, the amount of milk produced per cow has increased a lot. This means that the amount of water needed per cow has increased as well. It is unclear whether cows nowadays can drink enough water at the dairy farm, because individual water intake is currently not being monitored. An easy way of measuring the amount of water a cow drinks needs to be developed and artificial intelligence can be used to achieve just that. Using one camera per drinking trough, we want to survey the drinking behaviour. A cow can be detected in an image using algorithms like YOLOv5. We then need to detect whether it is drinking. By locating its head using an algorithm called DeepLabCut, we can predict a cow is drinking when its head is close to the drinking trough. Next, the cow needs to be identified in order to track its water consumption. We developed a model with the aim of doing this, called a siamese neural network. It can learn to 1) distinguish images of different cows and at the same time 2) learn to recognise different images of the same cow. These steps combined can let us analyse a video and track when a cow was drinking and which cow it was. The siamese neural network seems to be promising but needs to be improved by removing the background from an image, such that only the cow is visible. When this is achieved, we can easily measure the time a cow spends drinking. Combined with data from water flow meters, we can monitor how much water a cow drinks."

This is done by implementing a form of performance feedback within a pre-existing serious game. By applying concepts from providing feedback in serious games and introducing higher levels of musical diversity. More specifically applying Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) using rhythmic difficulty levels. These levels are subdivided by difficulty based upon measures of syncopation. An experiment was conducted with 14 participants testing the proposed improvements. The data being gathered consisted of game-scores and game experience using a pre-and post game survey. These results were extended using qualitative interviews with participants and a music therapist. Different approaches for providing feedback and enhancing the gaming experience are discussed. Recommendations are given for future implementations and practical limitations are acknowledged. Results indicate added value for providing feedback, although more focus can be on the personalisation of the provided messages. Further suggestions are provided on how to improve engagement within a MACT-game."

Impact of negative energy balance on the reward brain system via leptin signaling,"['Modafferi, Mattia']","['Adan, R.A.H.']",2023-01-24T01:00:58Z,EN,[],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Patients with Anorexia show a chronic Negative Energy Balance (i.e. reduced energy intake relative to energy expenditure). The hormone leptin regulates energy balance and related neuroendocrine functions. When the administration of this hormone is combined with an animal model of anorexia (Activity-Based Anorexia, ABA), it allows for the investigation of the effects of leptin on AN-like symptoms. This study aims at assessing whether and how pharmacologic treatment with leptin can suppress or prevent the development of anorectic behaviours in ABA. Additionally, we investigated whether chemogenetic manipulations of LepR in the lateral hypothalamus (LHLepR) could be effective to modulate energy balance. To this end, in our first experiments, we will use C57BL/6J mice to determine how systemic leptin treatment impacts negative energy balance. In our last experiment, we will use the transgenic LepR-cre mouse for the same purpose, by chemogenetic manipulating LHLepR neurons.
We found that following systemic and chronic leptin treatment, both aspects of energy balance (i.e. energy expenditure, and energy intake) decrease. Furthermore, chronic and systemic leptin treatment once AN-like symptoms had already developed, can prevent a drop in food intake as well as an increase in energy expenditure. Finally, Chemogenetic manipulation of hM3DGi in LHLepR neurons does not lead to reduced FAA or impact on BW/FI. 
Leptin treatment in ABA negatively influenced energy balance by decreasing RWA, but at the same time negatively influenced energy balance by decreasing food intake. Furthermore, once AN-like symptoms had already developed, leptin treatment did not negatively affect food intake while suppressing the emergence of hyperactivity during the initial phase of the leptin treatment. Finally, Chemogenetic stimulation of hM3DGi in LHLepR neurons does not lead to a reduction in hyperactive behaviours, while contemporarily preventing the emergence of significant differences in body weight or food intake in CNO vs vehicle mice."
Towards a circular textile industry,"['Bennis, Thomas']","['Vermeulen, Walter']",2023-01-21T01:00:51Z,EN,"['circular economy, textile industry, extended producer responsibility, waste management,\nsustainability, value retention options, r-ladder, recycling, reuse, clothing']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The world’s population has been rapidly expanding, and with that, the resource use has grown
exponentially. This has led to an immense amount of waste, which is generally not managed in a
sustainable manner, creating significant societal challenges. One way to limit this waste is by
implementing the concept of a circular economy (CE). An important policy that could help in
achieving this CE goal in that of extended producer responsibility (EPR). EPR is a governmental policy
that adds external costs associated with the processing of products after their use phase to the
market price of these products, paid for by the producers. The Dutch government has set CE goals for
its textile industry and is currently in the process of implementing an EPR legislation. However, past
EPR legislations have generally not been effective in transforming an industry towards circularity.
Therefore, the research question is as follows:
How can the upcoming Dutch EPR for textiles be structured to accelerate progress towards the
circularity goals?"
Lowering the amount of ethanol needed to create gelatin type A nanoparticle crosslinked with EDC and NHS by the addition of NaCl and changing the pH,"['Noordman, Thomas Jan']","['Kegel, W.K.']",2023-01-26T01:01:02Z,EN,['Gelantin; Gelatin A; Gelatin nanoparticles; nanoparticles; desolvation; EDC; NHS; 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl-carbodiimidehydrochloride; N-hydroxysuccinimide; crosslinkers; rheology; DLS;'],Nanomaterials Science,"Colloid gels are a promising biomaterial, because they allow a ""bottom-up"" strategy for designing shape-specific bulk materials by using micro- and nanoparticles. The use of gelatin is a promising source for these nanoparticles, due to it being cheap and biocompatible. One of these methods to create gelatin nanoparticles is the desolvation method, where gelatin is first dissolved in water and then ethanol is added. The ratio between ethanol and water needed to create the gelatin nanoparticles is 7.2 to 1. In this report, the desolvation method for gelatin type A is further developed with a focus on reducing the amount of ethanol needed. Lowering the amount of EtOH will reduce cost and allows for larger production scales. To stabilize the gelatin nanoparticles 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) are added as crosslinkers.  

It is shown that using salt (NaCl) could reduce the amount of EtOH significantly, however too much salt will result in sedimentation. It is also shown that increasing the pH from 3 to 3.5 could save 56% of the EtOH. However, adding both salt and changing the pH doesn't further decrease the ethanol needed.
In the end, a reduction of 56% in the volume of ethanol was possible, lowering the ratio of ethanol and water to 3.2 to 1. This allows two times as many gelatin nanoparticles to be created in the same total volume of solvent, making it possible to create 45 gram of gelatin nanoparticles in one 5L batch."
PRICE DISCRIMINATION AND BIG DATA: HIGHEST PRICES EVERY TIME WE CLICK?,"['Martínez Pastrana, Sebastián']","['Georgieva, Z.R.']",2023-01-26T01:01:29Z,EN,[],Law and Economics,"First-degree price discrimination has been known to theoretically allow the firm to extract full surplus from consumers. However, it has been assumed that first-degree price discrimination is not possible, as firms do not have information on the willingness to pay at the individual level. While sound historically, this argument may no longer hold. Large datasets on individual behavior, popularly referred to as “Big Data,” are now readily available, and contain information potentially useful for person-specific pricing. 

This thesis aims to allow the public to understand the impact and importance of Big Data on our daily lives when dealing with price discrimination in e-commerce and transactional platforms. It seeks to increase consciousness of how the information we provide to a website and our behavior when we have the mouse in our hand could impact our wallets. 

The thesis aspires to inquire into what competition authorities could do to mitigate the risks discussed – both through regulation and competition. It proposes the issuance of a new regulation aiming to address the core market failure of perfect price discrimination which seems to fall within a regulatory gap, jeopardizing consumer’s welfare."
Seeing is being: female role models in Dutch biology and physics secondary education textbooks,"['Montizaan, Melanie']","['Doorman, L.M.']",2023-01-26T01:01:35Z,EN,['gender; role model; science education; Dutch subject cluster choice; science textbooks; secondary school students'],Science Education and Communication,"To date, the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is male-dominated,
causing women to experience a low sense of belonging to the field and leading them to refrain from
pursuing a science related career. In the Netherlands, a person’s first decision towards a possible career
in the field of science takes place in secondary school during the subject cluster choice. Here, a similar
pattern is found with very few girls choosing physics, a science field with a male image, when compared
to biology which has a gender neutral image. This paper investigates the female role model availability
in Dutch physics and biology textbooks, supported by exploratory interviews on the influence of girls’
social environment on their subject cluster choice.
Twelve textbooks on the subjects of biology and physics were analysed and Dutch female secondary
school pupils were interviewed on the factors of their subject cluster choice. The results indicate a
significant difference in male and female role model availability in both biology and physics textbooks.
Women are mentioned significantly less regarding a science related occupation. Both fictional and nonfictional individuals were more likely to be male than female. Additionally, both subjects were found to
use male pronouns to refer to (previously) gender neutral individuals significantly more than female
pronouns. Furthermore, images in biology textbooks show women and men at a similar frequency, while
physics textbooks depict in images men significantly more often than women. Finally, girls perceive
their career aspirations and interest to be the main factors of their subject cluster choice. The influence
of the media, and a parent figure or teacher is mentioned as a factor for their decisions as well.
The underrepresentation of women in relation to science in Dutch secondary school textbooks of biology
and physics, can result in a lower sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and interest of girls to STEM and
maintain the male image within science. Inclusion of more female role models in education could change
the male stereotype and be the start of a more diverse and inclusive science."
Process- and Tool-centred Solutions for Ensuring Respect for Individuals’ Fundamental Rights in Algorithmic Credit Scoring,"['Opsenica, Eva']","['Kalis, J.P.']",2023-01-26T01:01:38Z,EN,['algorithmic credit scoring; Rule of Law; respect for fundamental rights; non-discrimination; privacy; data protection; consumer protection; AI safety'],Law and Technology in Europe,"Respect for fundamental rights is one of the values of the Rule of Law aimed at ensuring a society in which individuals can freely develop their identity, personality, and social relations and thus reach their potential to achieve set goals. With credit scoring using a subset of AI algorithms known as machine learning (ML) algorithms, which affects one’s access to credit, private life, and personal data, come threats to this value, particularly regarding the rights to non-discrimination, privacy, and data protection. Since access to credit determines individuals’ ability to fully participate in society or improve their standard of living, inequality in access due to errors or algorithmic discrimination cannot be treated solely as a matter of private law in any democracy upholding the Rule of Law and other EU values.
 
This thesis identifies gaps in EU legislation in regard to ensuring respect for said rights in algorithmic credit scoring and presents EU-level solutions, targeting both the process of and tool for this type of credit scoring. First analysed is the impact of the use of ML algorithms on the interpretation of the rights as protected in the EU. This is followed by an analysis of the risks algorithmic credit scoring poses to the respect for these rights and the extent to which relevant EU legislation can mitigate them, whereby the regulation of algorithmic credit scoring is considered in the contexts of consumer protection, data protection, and AI safety. Finally, solutions to fill the gaps in the legislation are proposed, with the conclusion acknowledging that considering the social and democratic importance of access to credit, the use of AI to assess how financially sound individuals are to justify the extension of credit may nevertheless not be a reality the EU should embrace."

As a result, a new cooking style, closely related to the ideas brought forth by Kurti, emerged at the end of the twentieth century: molecular cooking. Its proponents promised novelty, knowledge and inventions in regards to new cooking techniques and processes. Nevertheless, the movement was so vastly different from the culinary movements that came before (e.g. nouvelle cuisine) that its fame was accompanied by praise, confusion and criticism. This thesis explores how and to what extent the molecular cooking movement influenced the content of prominent Dutch chefs' cookbooks.

Een alternatief voor tbs: gevaarlijk of gewenst?

Daarnaast zijn de kaders van preventieve detentie gebaseerd op gevaar volgens de a-grond van artikel 5 van het EVRM geschetst, die preventieve detentie gebaseerd op gevaar mogelijk maakt. Hierbij wordt de jurisprudentie van het EHRM omtrent de Sicherungsverwahrung gebruikt, een Duitse vorm van preventieve detentie gebaseerd op gevaar. Hieruit is gebleken dat de belangrijkste voorwaarde van de a-grond, de causaliteit tussen veroordeling en detentie is. Wanneer dit causale verband, ofwel een sufficient causal connection, er niet is of wordt doorbroken, is er sprake van willekeurige vrijheidsbeneming. Wil er sprake zijn van een sufficient causal connection, dan moet er 1) een finding of guilt zijn, 2) er moet een causaal verband tussen indexdelict en detentie zijn, wat inhoudt dat de preventieve detentie gericht moet zijn op het voorkomen van soortgelijke strafbare feiten, 3) de gedetineerde moet de kans krijgen om zijn gevaar te reduceren door toegang tot geschikte middelen, zoals behandeling en 4) het is van belang dat het causale verband met verloop van tijd verzwakt.
Uit deze randvoorwaarden vloeien zowel andere mogelijkheden als beperkingen voort ten opzicht van tbs met dwangverpleging. Uit de analyse volgt dat a-grond leidt tot een ruimere mogelijkheid om tbs op te leggen ten opzichte van de e-grond, waar de huidige tbs onder valt. Er hoeft immers geen psychische stoornis te worden vastgesteld, een causaal verband tussen veroordeling en detentie is genoeg. Echter beperkt het EHRM deze mogelijkheid ook.
De eerste beperking ontstaat door het vereiste van causaal verband tussen indexdelict en detentie en leidt ertoe dat preventieve detentie niet verlengd kan worden wanneer iemand (zeer) gevaarlijk is maar dit gevaar ziet op een ander soort delict dan het indexdelict. De tweede beperking ontstaat mogelijk met het verstrijken van tijd, omdat het causale verband tussen veroordeling en detentie dan verzwakt. Geconcludeerd wordt dat deze beperkingen terechte restricties zijn aan de ruimte die bij het opleggen van preventieve detentie komt kijken. De derde beperking leidt echter tot een onwenselijk, en wat mij betreft tevens een onbegrijpelijk, knelpunt. Volledig ontoerekeningsvatbare daders vallen namelijk buiten deze vorm van preventieve detentie, omdat er volgens de restrictieve benadering van het EHRM geen sprake is van een finding of guilt.
Deze laatste beperking is dus het enige knelpunt van preventieve detentie onder de a-grond vergeleken met het huidige systeem. Waarvoor een oplossing met worden gezocht. De civiele zorgmachtiging als vangnet, leidt namelijk tot een aantal fundamentele bezwaren. Het voornaamste bezwaar is dat volledig ontoerekeningsvatbare daders op deze manier rechtstreeks vanuit de strafbank in de reguliere GGZ worden geplaatst. Daarnaast zijn er een aantal praktische bezwaren, zoals financiën en een gebrek aan beveiligde bedden.
Geconcludeerd wordt dat preventieve detentie gebaseerd op gevaar verder onderzoek verlangd. De a-grond biedt mogelijkheid om de Michael P’s in de samenleving makkelijker preventieve detentie op te kunnen leggen; een vraag die vanuit zowel de maatschappij als de literatuur toch regelmatig klinkt. Hoewel het EHRM enige restricties oplegt, is verder onderzoek naar wenselijke restricties op zijn plaats. Voor welke delicten mag deze preventieve detentie worden opgelegd? Is het wenselijk om hierin de lijn van de huidige tbs te volgen? Daarnaast verdient het vraagstuk hoe het knelpunt van de volledig ontoerekeningsvatbare daders opgelost wordt verder onderzoek. Zijn er strafrechtelijke wegen die bewandeld bewandeld of vrijgemaakt kunnen worden?"

The main argument is that these reorganisations dialectically interact with cultural imaginaries of the university. Efforts to democratise the university run parallel to the conception of the university as ‘community’, whereas managerialisation is congruent with notions of the university as ‘goal organisation’ or ‘enterprise’. Indeed, the university developed as an increasingly managerialist institution. Throughout this history legislative reforms mark turning points, beginning with the Wet Universitaire Bestuurshervorming (WUB) and ending with the Wet Modernisering Universiteitsbestuur (MUB). Nevertheless, the periods before and between these pivot points are of critical importance, as this is when the optima forma of the university is under discussion, and, parallelly, reconstructions of the academy occur. I have conceptualised the discussion along three different notions of how power should be organised: oligarchy, managerialism or democracy. This thesis is informed by critical social theory. Concepts of sociologist Pierre Bourdieu account for social reproductive tendencies in the academic field, whereas class conflict theory explains social change in that same field. I have argued that the salience of democratic discourse and the proletarianization of the academy are mutually supportive. The WUB aimed to combine democratic and managerial discourses. I have demonstrated, though, that as the WUB-system was constructed, the advantages hang heavily towards the managerial side. Managerialism consolidated evermore as a result of transformations in the financial infrastructure of academia. The ongoing process towards a managerialist university ultimately culminated, and was codified, in the MUB.

Stock Price Simulation under Jump-Diffusion Dynamics: A WGAN-Based Framework with Anomaly Detection,"['Gan, Renren']","['Oosterlee, C.W.']",2023-01-26T01:02:01Z,EN,['Jump-diffusion model; Wasserstein GAN; Anomaly Detection'],Mathematical Sciences,"Jump-diffusion path simulation is a popular topic in the finance area. In numerical path simulation, it is usually split into a diffusion part and a jump part. We propose a GAN-based framework that gives a general pattern for the jump-diffusion path simulation. The framework consists of two parts: 1) the diffusion learning part for the simulation of the diffusion part; 2) the jump detection part related to the jump simulation. The diffusion simulation is achieved by a conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (called SDE-WGAN). The SDE-WGAN is an adapted model from a GAN-based SDEs simulation methodology, showing its advantages in stable training. The jump detection model is designed to detect the jump instances in a jump-diffusion path and estimate the jump parameters. The jump instances are detected by introducing a GAN-based anomaly detection method, as the jumps can be viewed as anomalies that are inconsistent with the non-jump data and rare to occur in the real market. The SDE-WGAN is well-combined since it can only generate non-jump states. The jumps are then recognized when the SDE-WGAN generated pattern significantly differs from the actual state. The maximum likelihood estimation is then applied to approximate the jump parameters based on the detected jump instances. We perform the proposed framework for simulating the Merton's model and obtain promising results. However, the framework may fail when the jump magnitude is small."
"The Triangular Relationship between Mental Heath, Armed Conflict and Criminal Liability Under Article 8 of the Rome Statute","['Posta, Sandy']","['Ryngaert, Cedric']",2023-01-26T01:01:44Z,EN,[],Public International Law,"Article 8 of the Rome Statute regulates war crimes, referring to any violations of the IHL. IHL traditionally focuses on mental harm. However, armed conflicts can also cause severe mental harm. The development of science allows reliable assessment of mental harm caused by armed conflict. Hence this thesis looked at the triangular relation between mental heath, armed conflict and criminal liability under article 8 of the Rome Statute. It aims to answers the question; To what extent could mental harm trigger individual criminal responsibility under article 8 of the Rome Statute?
The research found that armed conflict is capable of causing serious mental harm, including PTSD, depression, anxiety, insomnia, psychosomatic complaints, DID, and so on. Which in turn causes hypertension, cardiovascular disease, decreased immune system, and so on. The aforementioned harm can be caused by various prohibited acts under IHL. For example, torture, sexual abuse,  separation from parents, recruitment into military activity, water shortage, nutritional deficiencies, stress of caregivers, unnecessary suffering, community destruction, displacement, exposure to traumatic incidents and violence, loss of protective factors, stress caused by migration and reintegration, and so on. It may disable a person´s daily functioning and may last a lifetime. Reliable diagnose include trauma-focused cognitive therapy, MRI and so on. It was concluded that these methods are capable or reliably posterior assessment, as well as it can accurately predict their emerge. 
Followingly it was found that article 8 itself did not specifically referred to mental harm. However, EoC made reference to mental harm. Other sources provided a more extensive protection. However, there were commonalities. First, mental harm may fall under the scope of war crimes, provided that mental harm is severe enough. Moreover, torture, inhuman and degrading treatment resulting in mental harm appears to be prohibited. Additionally, mutilation, harmful medical practices, sexual violence and a few other forms of mental harms are referred to, but not extensively dealt with. Hence, it was concluded that mental harm may trigger individual criminal responsibility under article 8 of the Rome Statute. However, IHL provide little explanation on it. Therefore, the research turned to national and international sources of law.

Embracing Core & Supervising the Optimisation Pipeline,"['Peters, Hugo']","['Swierstra, W.S.']",2023-01-26T01:01:59Z,EN,['Haskell;hs-sleuth;GHC;core;optimisation;rewrite rules'],Computing Science,"We have shown how GHC can have unpredictable results when it comes to its Core optimisation pipeline.
We motivated why existing techniques to analyze the output of the core2core pipeline are unsatisfactory.
We then proposed our custom tool hs-sleuth to aid in this discovery process. During the development
of hs-sleuth, we set out to answer a number of questions (Section 1.4) which have since been answered.
We answer them here explicitly for completeness’s sake.
Main Question How can GHC’s core2core passes be captured and presented in such a way that users
productively gain insight into how their code is transformed?
A snapshot of the current state of the program can be captured by embellishing the core2core pipeline with
snapshot passes via GHC’s plugin interface. The captured ASTs can be pretty printed in a web application
to provide interactive features such a hovering, clicking, dragging, and highlighting. By providing various
suppression options, the Core snapshots can be presented such that they nearly resemble canonical Haskell
source code. Finally, by allowing users to scroll through time, they can quickly observe if and when their
expectations are not met.
Sub-Question 1 How does one efficiently identify where small changes occur in two or more captures?
While a novel tree diff approach might prove more usefull, matching toplevel definitions by a hash of their
body is a productive approach to highlight deviations among captures.
Sub-Question 2 How to make viewing core more manageable using various display options?
Allowing programmers to hide as much irrelevant information as is sensible for the goal at hand is a
key part to ensure manageability. Moreover, making information such as variable names manually more
precise significantly reduces the mental strain of reading the Core.
Sub-Question 3 How could performance regressions that have occurred in the past in popular Haskell
projects, have been resolved faster?
As hs-sleuth lowers the bar to entry for analysing Core, we think that it will similarly become a more
approachable task for developers to confirm their optimisation approaches and subsequently guard against
regressions using non-functional tests."
Microbe-Microplastic Axis: Microplastics As Both Microbial Toxin and Tool,"['Kanter, Tom de']","['Wosten, Han']",2023-01-26T01:01:54Z,EN,['Microplastic; Microbe; Plastisphere; Toxins; Tools; Degradation'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Microplastics (MPs) in the environment are becoming a growing concern worldwide. Produced by the weathering of plastic waste or through intentional manufacturing, these microscopic synthetic particles are associated with adverse health effects in humans, animals, and even microbes. Due to their small size, MPs have an exceptionally large surface area that, in combination with their intrinsic hydrophobicity and natural weathering, gives them an increased affinity for toxins. Indeed, MPs can contain up to a million times the concentration of heavy metals, organic pollutants, and toxic secondary metabolites compared to their environment. Internalisation of or adherence to MPs by microorganisms has been linked to a decreased growth rate, altered gene expression, lower photosynthetic efficiency, and even cell death. However, despite their toxicity, the microbial utilisation of MPs as tools for protection, carbon and nutrient acquirement, and gene transfer through biofilm formation has now been recognised. Furthermore, microbe-mediated depolymerisation and mineralisation of MPs through the emergence of plastic-degrading enzymes and oxygen radicals highlights the employment of microorganisms as potential solution for the removal of MPs from the biosphere. Yet, it is unlikely that efficient degradation pathways for different types of plastic will evolve naturally in the near future, meaning that alternative approaches must be considered to clean-up the planet. Ultimately, this literature review presents the state of the art on MPs as microbial toxins and tools while exposing the MP-degradation potential of microorganisms and their role in decontaminating the environment."

This research tries to develop knowledge that contributes to the completion of the indicator set for the building context. The biological structures and processes that deliver ES in the ecological environment are identified through a literature review and translated to the built environment. Indicators for the built environment are proposed based on these results and existing indicators for the ecological environment. Also, a new framework is proposed to describe the ecological system (Boerema et al., 2017a) behind ES delivery. Based on this refined understanding of ES delivering infrastructures this research concludes that it is possible to formulate better indicators for the ecological environment and verify new indicators for the built environment. As a final step methodological triangulation, based on an interview and a literature review, was performed to verify the relevance and setup of a table proposed for communication of the knowledge developed in this research."

Interpretation of premature ventricular contractions in athletes: a proposal for a diagnostic tool,"['Oerlemans, Dirk']","['Cramer, Maarten Jan']",2023-01-27T01:00:57Z,EN,[],Biology of Disease,"Regular exercise helps to prevent and treat several diseases. It is favourabel for mental health, general well-being, and benefits the heart. As you may know, physical activity elevates heart rhythm, which causes an increase in blood flow to transfer oxygen and nutrients to your muscles. Incidentally, this can be experienced during sports as a fluttering feeling in the chest or an increased awareness of the heartbeat. In most of the cases, such apparent heartbeats are completely innocent. However, the heart can incidentally have issues with coordinating heartbeats correctly, which is called heart rhythm disease or arrythmia. Most arrythmias are innocent and do not directly affect the quality of life. However, in very rare cases, arrythmias can lead to abrupt loss of heart function when not managed carefully. Recent studies found that in very rare cases, practicing intensive endurance sports can be dangerous for individuals with underlying heart disease. Your heart needs to work harder when doing intense exercise, which might be a problem if your heart is damaged. When people engaged in intensive endurance sports are not aware of possible heart rhythm problems, it can put them at higher risk for a cardiac arrest during sports activity. Therefore, it is important to inform a physician if any warranting signals regarding the heart rhythm occur. Physicians can investigate the nature of the deviating heart rhythm and assess whether it is needed to make any adaptations in lifestyle, such as imposing sport restrictions. Luckily, in most cases, a divergent heart rhythm is innocent and does not require individuals to downscale the intensity or frequency of their training ritual. However, in rare cases intense sports activity worsens prognosis of the cardiovascular health of an athlete, or even worse contributes to fatal outcome. Therefore, interference by physicians is in some cases required. Nowadays, hhysicians have several tools to determine whether athletes are at higher risk if they continue with their sport ritual. Physicians map amongst others deviating heart beats, which are also called premature ventricular beats (PVCs). These beats origin from the ventricles rather than the sinoatrial node. PVCs can be recognized on an electrocardiogram, which is a record of a person’s heartbeat. PVCs might be an indicator to determine whether a patient is at risk for SCD-related arrythmia. 
But how does a physician assess which PVC is innocent and which is harmful? This article provides a proposal for a tool to help physicians answering this important question. I investigated which characteristics of PVCs play an important role for this assessment. Is there a correlation between number of PVCs in 24h on a patient’s electrocardiogram and possible risk? Or is it more important how a single PVC is patterned? I also elaborate on the value of several clinical tools, such as the electrocardiography, a maximal exercise test, and cardiac magnetic resonance in case further investigation in athletes with PVCs is needed. To conclude, I summarized my findings in a flowchart, which can serve as a guideline for physicians to evaluate PVCs in athletes. This proposal might help physicians to evaluate PVCs and separate athletes which cardiovascular health is at risk because of their sport activities."
Investigating blood-brain barrier leakage after photothrombotic stroke via DCE-MRI at 9.4T,"['Koprolin, Maximilian']","['Dijkhuizen, Rick']",2023-01-28T01:00:51Z,EN,['Post-stroke epilepsy; stroke; DCE-MRI'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is a phenomenon in which patients experience two or more seizures one week or later upon suffering a stroke. While there is lack of scientific consensus regarding the etiology of PSE, there is evidence that blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption is a distinctive component of its origin. However, more insights are required to understand how BBB integrity mediates epileptogenesis. PSE is linked to poor functional recovery, and the sole treatment in use are antiepileptic drugs, which often lead to severe side effects. Thus, fully understanding the BBB integrity’s mediating role in PSE is an important step towards developing alternative treatments. Additionally, novel prognostic tools that can discern stroke patients at risk of developing PSE are needed. Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) allows the estimation of BBB permeability by modeling contrast agent (CA) leakage through the BBB in-vivo. Using this method, we aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of BBB integrity in relation to the development of PSE and identify MRI-based biomarkers that could predict the risk of acquiring PSE. To achieve this, we induced photothrombotic stroke in Sprague-Dawley rats, to mimic stroke in humans. Subsequently, the animals were scanned in a 9.4T MRI scanner, over various timepoints. Scans were conducted between 24 hours and 8 weeks post-procedure, using different concentrations of CA. The concentrations of CA present in the sagittal sinus and lesions were estimated via concentration mapping. Additionally, phantom scans were conducted, to validate in-vivo findings. Together, the data directly contributes to the optimization of DCE-MRI protocols at high field strengths, which can be adopted for a longitudinal study."

Haverschmidt is often portrayed as a melancholic personality who suffered from great periods of depression, which inevitably led him to commit suicide. The use of medical terminology such as depression and terminology stemming from literary theory like melancholy is criticised in this research as well as the deterministic implication that is retrospectively attached to it. Moving away from this dominant portrayal of Haverschmidt´s inner state this research adopts the analytic use of emotion practises as operationalised by anthropologist and historian Monique Scheer. Discerning between four categories of emotion practises – mobilisation, naming, communication and regulation – four travelogues written by Haverschmidt are analysed. The study of these travelogues not only reveal the complex and sometimes conflicting origin of the emotion practises performed by Haverschmidt, that are best explained by the union of modern Protestantism and romanticism, but also the mundane practises that defined his day-to-day emotional experience. Taken together, a ‘web of feeling’ emerges that moves beyond the medicalisation of Haverschmidt´s mental state and the legacy of his persona primarily grounded in his tragic passing."
Metabolic Characterization of HiPSC-CMs derived from a Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Patient Harboring the MYH7 p.R403L Variant,"['Ammerlaan, Daniëlle']","['Harakalova, Magdalena']",2023-01-28T01:01:00Z,EN,[],Biology of Disease,"2
Abstract
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a severe hypercontractile disorder of the heart affecting 1 in 500 individuals. It is often caused by variants in sarcomere proteins, including the β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7), leading to abnormalities in calcium handling and cellular metabolism. Although the pathogenic variants in MYH7 are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, the exact mechanism in HCM remains unknown. In this study, we first metabolically matured human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) derived from an HCM patient resembling the HCM phenotype. Hereafter, we functionally characterized our model by examining contractile function and mitochondrial respiration. Additionally, we treated the cells with metabolic inhibitors (oligomycin, carbonyl cyanide-4 (trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone, and rotenone/antimycin A) and enhancers (fenofibrate and bezafibrate) and evaluated the metabolic changes using seahorse and immunofluorescent imaging, respectively. In our diseased cell lines, we observed prolonged cardiac contraction, decreased fatty acid oxidation, and minor response upon metabolic inhibition. By re-activating the metabolic activities with fenofibrate, proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) levels were boosted while hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase trifunctional multienzyme complex subunit alpha (HADHA) levels remained unchanged. Immunofluorescent staining of sarcomeres using alpha actinin (ACTN2) and MYH7 antibodies revealed sarcomere disarray in diseased cells and recurrence of the variant in one of the isogenic control cell lines. Taken together, our study shows aberrant contractile function, impaired myocardial energy metabolism, and sarcomere disarray in a hiPSC-CMs model carrying the MYH7_R403L variant. Future research should include routine sequencing of hiPSC-CMs lines and improve maturation strategies to model HCM in vitro. Additionally, the time point of fibrate administration during pre-clinical in vitro studies in HCM should be further optimized."
Optimal Policy Under Uncertain Climate Sensitivity in an Agent-Based Model,"['Romero-Wilcock, Ben']","['Wieners, C.E.']",2023-01-26T01:02:03Z,EN,['Climate policy; Integrated assessment modelling; Agent-based modelling; Bayesian inference'],Climate Physics,"This report aims to answer two primary research questions: how aggressive policymakers should be in
their approach to mitigation while the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) is still largely uncertain,
and whether policymakers should adapt their strategy as understanding of the ECS evolves. An agent-based integrated assessment model, the DSK model, is modified to incorporate adaptive policymakers,
who learn the climate sensitivity as the global mean surface temperature increases and update their
strategy accordingly. The learning process is a combination of Bayesian inference and externally imposed
probability distribution functions, which aim to simulate developments in climate science. The outcomes,
in global warming and unemployment, seen under adaptive policymakers are compared with the outcomes
under non-adaptive policymakers, who maintain the same approach as temperature increases. Risk-neutral policymakers, concerned with the expected ECS are compared with risk-averse policymakers, who
are concerned with the 99th percentile value. These four policymakers are compared under two policies:
a carbon tax with no accompanying policy, and a carbon tax, 50% of the revenue of which is used to fund
the building of renewable energy sources. It is concluded that only risk-averse policymaking is effective,
where meeting the Paris Climate Agreement goals are concerned. Among risk-averse policymakers, when
the results are aggregated across different ECSs according to their current estimated probability, non-adaptive policymaking achieves the greatest climate mitigation. However it also leads to higher expected
unemployment, even under the second policy. While which of these policymaking strategies is preferable
may be debatable, it is clear that it is the choice of policy that has the most impact, in terms of both
unemployment and climate change."

research was therefore to investigate whether VR height exposure cues can influence mental
imagery and height interpretation biases in individuals with elevated levels of fear of heights.
A multiple baseline design was used. Three participants were screened and upon meeting the
inclusion criteria filled out the acrophobia questionnaire, the height interpretation
questionnaire and the fear of heights mental imagery scale for 11 to 13 days in a row. During
this time participants were exposed to two VR height exposure cues. It was found that
acrophobia symptoms decreased following the VR height exposure cues in each participant.
Mental imagery and height interpretation biases decreased in participant one and three, but
not in participant two. Falling related mental imagery decreased in participant one and three
also, but again not in participant two. Each participant noted that they experienced mental
imagery in the first person perspective. This pilot study provided the important first step to
investigate the effect of VR exposure cues on height interpretation biases and mental imagery
and found that height interpretation bias and mental imagery decrease after VR height
exposure cues in individuals who are very fearful of heights."

This shift led to a focus on urban space and the capitalization of urban areas, which contributed to the neglect or even sacrifice of cultural and natural assets, in pursuit of economic development. The Tourism Incentive Law of 1982 and neoliberal development policies facilitated large-scale land investments, which had significant impacts on the country's planning system and the use and transformation of urban and rural spaces (Vuruşkan & OrtaÇeşme, 2009). These developments led to an increase in demand for raw materials, particularly in the Çeşme district where the growing tourism industry and increasing housing projects have resulted in a reliance on mining resources and increased demand for infrastructure development. Urbanization and the development of new infrastructure, which may be intended to promote regional development and create public benefits, can result in land use and land cover change (LULCC). This can lead to increased pressure on natural resources and create new patterns of inequity, as well as the exclusion of certain groups, such as the rural community. This research focused on large-scale land investments and their impacts on LULCC as well as the livelihood strategies of the local/rural community and their responses to these investments and developments using an exploratory case study approach in the Çeşme District. The study included interviews with local authorities to gather information about the developments and investments in the region, as well as a survey that was conducted with the rural community to understand their responses to these new developments. Overall the majority of the rural community stated that they do not think the large-scale investments around their village help regional development. The negative impacts of large-scale investments on the rural community in Çeşme District include the destruction of pasturelands and restriction of access to common areas, noise and visual pollution from wind farms and quarries, environmental pollution from quarries, and the loss of farmlands and occupation of coastal regions due to housing investments, as well as expropriation. These developments have also been associated with a decrease in biodiversity, according to the respondents. Most respondents feel they are not receiving adequate support or resources from authorities to address the challenges they face. The main strategy employed by the rural community against the negative impacts of large-scale investments was to take legal action. This highlights the importance of communities being proactive in protecting their rights and interests when it comes to resource extraction and development projects that may affect them. It may also be helpful for communities to seek support from local, regional, or national organizations or agencies that can help advocate for their rights and provide assistance in navigating the legal and regulatory processes involved in such conflicts."
De taalstrijd in het publieke debat,"['Prins, Rieneke']","['Hörmann, Pauline']",2023-01-31T01:01:59Z,NL,['publiek debat; beleidsbeïnvloeding; framing; abortus'],"Communicatie, beleid en management","40 jaar na de invoering van de Wet Afbreking zwangerschap zou het te verwachten zijn dat het recht op abortus inmiddels algemeen geaccepteerd is. Toch laait de strijd tegen abortus de laatste jaren weer meer op. Partijen binnen de oppositie rondom abortus weten elkaar om die reden steeds beter te vinden; ze werken meer samen, zijn beter georganiseerd en gefinancierd, en spreken zich ten slotte meer uit in publieke debat over abortusrechten. Dit laatste doen zij door hun boodschappen strategisch te framen. Door middel van een frame wordt een vraagstuk op een bepaalde manier belicht, waardoor toehoorders anders naar – in dit geval abortusrechten – gaan kijken. Het doel van de oppositie met het gebruik van framing in het publieke debat is om uiteindelijk abortusbeleid te kunnen beïnvloeden. In een democratie zou het publieke debat namelijk de input moeten vormen voor beleid. Op het moment dat de oppositie strategisch gebruik maakt van framing om het publieke debat te sturen, kunnen zij daarmee dus ook indirect invloed uitoefenen op beleid.
Het doel van dit onderzoek is allereerst om inzichtelijk te maken welke partijen zich binnen de oppositie voor abortus in Nederland bevinden, en vervolgens te onderzoeken hoe zij framing inzetten als middel om het publieke debat en daaropvolgend beleid te beïnvloeden. Door hier inzicht in te verkrijgen, kan Rutgers haar advocacy-strategie bijsturen. De vraag die in dit onderzoek centraal staat is dan ook: ‘Hoe maken politieke en maatschappelijke partijen binnen de oppositie rondom abortusrechten in Nederland gebruik van frames om het publieke debat, en daaropvolgend beleid over dit thema te beïnvloeden?’
Om deze vraag te kunnen beantwoorden is gebruik gemaakt van zowel literatuuronderzoek, documentanalyses als interviews. Het literatuuronderzoek heeft als doel om op basis van wetenschappelijke literatuur het verband te verklaren tussen framing, het publieke debat, en de beïnvloeding van beleid. Met de documentanalyses wordt getracht de partijen binnen de oppositie in Nederland zo uitgebreid mogelijk in kaart te brengen. Hiervoor worden onderzoeken en artikelen gebruikt van verschillende personen die zich eerder in de oppositie, en in hun strategieën, hebben verdiept. Ten slotte zijn er interviews afgenomen met respondenten die op de een of andere manier te maken hebben gehad met de oppositie. De selectie bestaat uit een combinatie van beleidsmedewerkers, onderzoekers, maar ook personen binnen de ‘pro-choice’ beweging. Door deze verschillende methoden te combineren kon uiteindelijk een overzicht worden gemaakt van de verschillende partijen in het netwerk, en van de manieren waarop zij framing inzetten om beleid te beïnvloeden. Hierbij is gefocust op Nederland, maar ook op internationale organisaties die invloed uitoefenen op het debat in Nederland.
De internationale partijen waarvan de duidelijkste link te leggen is met betrekking tot de beïnvloeding van het Nederlandse publieke debat en daaropvolgend beleid zijn de TCC, Agenda Europe, de ECPM en TFP. Van Nederlandse partijen zijn dit Civitas Christiana, de NPV, De VBOK en Siriz, Schreeuw om Leven, de SGP, de CU, en het FvD. Daarbij valt op dat er sprake is van een combinatie van conservatief christelijke partijen en extreemrechtse partijen. De reden voor deze ‘gelegenheidssamenwerking’ is dat beide soorten stromingen ageren tegen een progressieve agenda in het algemeen, en elkaar op het thema ‘abortus’ goed kunnen vinden qua gedachtegoed.
 De zeven verschillende frames die naar voren zijn gekomen die de oppositie gebruikt om het publieke debat, en daaropvolgend beleid, te beïnvloeden zijn:1) het ‘onderdrukkingsframe’, 2) ‘mensenrechtenframe’, 3) ‘doembeeldenframe’, 4) ‘neutraliteitsframe’, 5) ‘ecologieframe’, 6) ‘demografieframe’ en 7) ‘neokolonialismeframe’.

of the medical curriculum. There is a need for better integration of this role in the medical curriculum of
the Utrecht University. The objective of this study was to gain insight into the learning needs of
medical students regarding the CanMEDS-role Health Advocate and to research if Community-engaged medical education could be a fitting base for the new curriculum.

Method: This qualitative interview study utilised aspects from grounded theory. Six interviews were
conducted with fifth- and sixth-year students of the Utrecht University medical program. The interviews
were transcribed verbatim, forming the dataset. A thematic analysis was used to identify, analyse and
report on patterns in the data.

Results: Four themes emerged from the data concerning the students’ learning needs; (1) Retention
of knowledge, (2) Practical skills (3) Students’ competency and (4) Educational methods. With regard
to Community-engaged medical education, attitude towards Community-engaged medical education
appeared as a fifth theme.

Conclusion: This study highlights a deficit in knowledge retention on health advocacy themes among
fifth- and sixth-year medical students, a need for more practical examples, more skills training
throughout the program, and more opportunities to apply Health Advocate skills during their clerkships.
The results suggest that the learning needs of the students of the Utrecht medical program could be
fulfilled by instituting Community-engaged medical education within the curriculum."
Surplus Food Redistribution: Towards a World Where No Good Food Goes to Waste,"['Veselá, Andrea']","['Rosales Carreon, Jesus']",2023-01-31T01:01:56Z,EN,['food waste; hunger; surplus food; surplus food redistribution; European Union'],Sustainable Development,"Food waste is a major global issue, with negative environmental, social and economic impacts. Surplus food redistribution is a strategy, through which the problem of food waste can be effectively combatted by redirecting edible food, which would otherwise be wasted, to people. In the European Union, 127 kg/capita of food is wasted every year, while 36.2 million people cannot afford a nutritious meal every second day. Reducing these figures is paramount, and can be achieved effectively through surplus food redistribution. The aim of this research was to explore surplus food redistribution possibilities across the Member States of the European Union, present an overview of practices from the non-profit and for-profit sectors, and find best practice examples through a multi-criteria decision analysis. Stakeholders from these organisations, and other experts, were then interviewed to gain insights on the impact of surplus food redistribution, challenges, perceptions of policies and future outlooks for surplus food redistribution in the European Union. This research found that food waste can be combatted through surplus food redistribution in the EU with increased funding and awareness of surplus food redistribution organisations and their activities, knowledge-sharing and replication of virtuous practices, and last but not least, harmonised monitoring and reporting of food waste across the European Union. Focusing on these solutions can increase surplus food redistribution in the EU, and thus prevent food waste and have positive effects on the planet, as well as on its people."

One needs to model these waveforms accurately to gain information from NSBH waveform signals. A unique feature of NSBHs is that the merger can happen in a disruptive manner, i.e. the neutron star can get tidally disrupted before it merges with the black hole for a certain parameter subspace of the system. This unique feature has a distinct imprint on the GWs an NSBH produces. Understanding the tidal disruption of the neutron star by a companion black hole plays a vital role in accurately modelling waveforms. We construct an effective action considering dynamical tidal effects and aligned spin interactions in our work. We can use the action to set up an energy balance from which we can compute the orbital frequency at which the neutron star tidally disrupts. The parameter region of validity is given by Λ2 ∈ [1, 5000], Q ∈ [1, 10], χNS and χBH ∈ [−0.5, 0.5]. It is shown that this novel model agrees with numerical relativity (NR) results and significantly outperforms the merger frequencies obtained from the current waveform model PhenomNSBH. Furthermore, recommendations are made for further NR simulations to verify the model such that it can be used to generate accurate gravitational waveforms."

Although it appears as a clear case of environmental injustice, it is situated in one of the richest and most socially secure countries in the world. This makes it an interesting paradox when compared to more classical cases of environmental injustice such as that of oil drilling in the Niger Delta, which is rich in historic marginalisation. This research examines the functioning of the environmental justice framework in describing the lived experiences of injustice in a highly privileged country such as the Netherlands. This was done by comparing the lived experiences of the people of Groningen to those of the people of the Niger delta. With this I contributed to expanding the environmental justice framework to become more encompassing, showing that comparison of cases is indeed possible, whilst simultaneously contributing to the dearth of qualitative data in the discourse. The qualitative research involved meetings with involved organisations, and focus groups and interviews with inhabitants of both regions. These were analysed using the environmental justice frameworks of Fraser and Nussbaum and compared to the lived experiences of the inhabitants of the Niger delta. It was found firstly that the frameworks were indeed capable of capturing and interpreting the lived experiences in Groningen. Secondarily, the research showed that the experiences in both approaches were impacted in varying but comparable ways. Importantly, it showed many experiences to be similar between cases, even though the impacts of the actual injustice were not, and Groningen had no history of marginalisation. I thus argue that the comparing of cases is indeed possible and useful and provides valuable clues about underlying systemic problems. Furthermore, I argue that the prerequisite of historic marginalisation hampers the frameworks capacity to describe cases that would otherwise benefit from qualifying as environmental injustice, such as Groningen."
Plastic Degrading Fungi: A solution to overcome the issues of degrading mixed plastics,"['Klusener, Janieke']","['Wosten, Han']",2023-02-01T00:00:32Z,EN,[],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"This review looks at biodegradation as a solution to plastic waste, more specifically the issues with mixed plastics. Three fungi are chosen based on their ability to breakdown more than one type of synthetic polymer. Together, these three fungal isolates should be able to degrade all the main types of plastics. The three fungi include Fusarium solani, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and Cephalosporium sp. Furthermore, the biodegradation pathways for each main type of plastic is discussed."
Magnetic Lineations in the Lake IJssel,"['Aalst, Warner van']","['Dekkers, Mark']",2023-01-31T01:02:02Z,EN,['Paleomagnetisme;Greigiet;IJsselmeer;Lineaties'],"Earth, Life and Climate","In 2020, Periplus Archeomare was commissioned by de Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel
Erfgoed (Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands) to magnetically map the Lake IJssel
(The Netherlands). Subsequent processing of this data resulted in the discovery of curvy linear magnetic structures, reminiscent of gullies. It is our aim to discover the origin and
elucidate the genesis of the positive/negative magnetic anomalies using paleomagnetic and
rock magnetic methods. If the strata are paleomagnetically well behaved they could be dated
paleomagnetically. Cores were sampled from a cross section of both positive as well as
negative anomalies in a presumed river structure. The three sampled cores, VC15 of 5 meters,
VC17 of 5 meters, and VC26 of 7 meters, contain the geologic history from the late
Pleistocene to present of the Lake IJssel. Its geological make up consists, from the bottom up,
of terrestrial – riverine – lacustrine – deltaic – lacustrine deposits. Magnetic susceptibility
measurements indicate a stronger magnetic signal in the core segments containing clays.
Acquisition curves of the isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) and thermomagnetic
analysis of the same strata show that the magnetic carrier is greigite (Fe3S4), diagentic in
origin. The stratigraphic units in which greigite was primarily found are the Velsen Bed and
Wormer Member. These are coastal deposits, or lacustrine/estuarine, allowing for an anoxic,
sulfate reducing environment in which greigite can be formed. The influx of riverine
freshwater of the Oer-Vecht and Oer-IJssel lowers the sulfate concentration in the water, and
limits the reaction, allowing the preservation of greigite. The natural remanent magnetization
(NRM) yielded interpretable trends from considerable portions of the cores. These trends
however cannot be correlated faithfully to master curves of the paleosecular variation.
Additional data points and age markers would allow to compare the Lake IJssel record to the
paleomagnetic data sets of Western Europe"
Optimization of the in vitro canine oviduct epithelium culture system,"['Carranza Villarejo, Chio']","['Stout, Tom']",2023-04-15T00:00:57Z,EN,"['canine oviduct epithelial cells, secondary cilia, Notch pathway, cell differentiation, Transwell inserts']",Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"To date, most assisted reproductive technologies in canid species remain poorly successful. This may be attributed to physiological differences in the bitch; mainly, the meiotic resumption of the oocyte in the oviduct, after being released in germinal vesicle stage from the ovary. This represents a major challenge for harvesting mature oocytes; thus, in vitro maturation (IVM) of canine oocytes is required. Recent studies have shown that co- culturing immature oocytes with oviduct epithelial cells (cOEC) increases the chances of oocyte meiotic resumption in vitro. However, the current protocols for isolating and culturing cOECs have failed to provide a favorable environment for IVM. In the present study we aimed to optimize the isolation of cOEC and culturing a monolayer system with Transwell® inserts. We hypothesized that the introduction of an air-liquid interface, in combination with the inhibition of the Notch pathway, would stir cOEC differentiation towards a morphology that more closely resembles the in vivo oviduct epithelium. We successfully managed to isolate cOECs from 15 bitches by enzymatic digestion and mechanic squeezing of the ex vivo oviducts obtained by elective ovariectomy in anestrus. Cells were directly seeded in Transwell inserts and cultured, first, for 7 days in a liquid-liquid interface, which allowed them to de-differentiate and form a confluent monolayer; then, 16 days in an air-liquid interface where they polarized into a columnar shape and re-differentiated into ciliated and non-ciliated cells. After, 10 more days of culturing in an air-liquid interface with the addition of DBZ, to further stimulate ciliation. Confluence of the monolayers was assessed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance.
By immunofluorescent staining, we found two main morphological categories of monolayers, low and high cell- density monolayers. The former, characterized by the presence of flat, irregular-shaped, unpolarized cells. The latter, resembling the desired morphology the most, with polarized columnar cells; nevertheless, the presence of ciliated cells after introducing the air-liquid interface, remained below 20%.
Treatment with DBZ only enhanced ciliation significantly in monolayers containing >15% ciliated cells, preceding the treatment. To determine the effects of DBZ on ciliogenesis related transcription factors FOXJ1 and RFX1, and Notch primary target genes, we performed qRT-PCR assays on two high cell-density monolayer samples. Expression fold change profiles were mostly consistent with our theoretical hypothesis: upregulation in transcription factors FOXJ1 and RFX1 and a downregulation in target genes HES1 and HEY1.
Overall, high cell-density monolayers resembled the in vivo morphology the most. However, functionality and long-term sustainability of the model remain unknown. This study provides a good foundation for further optimization of the cOEC monolayer Transwell® model."
Composition and activity of CuAu/Pt core/shell electrocatalytic nanoalloys using first-principles calculations and machine learning,"['Kruit, Robin van der']","['Artrith, N.']",2023-04-15T00:00:42Z,EN,['CuAu/Pt; computational; surface; DFT; machine learning; dissociation; oxygen; hydrogen; NEB'],Nanomaterials Science,"Noble metal nanoparticles continue to be of great interest to the catalysis community for their characteristics, and extensive research has been conducted into bimetallic nanoparticles involving these metals. Inclusion of another metal to form trimetallic particles could further enhance the characteristics of these particles by increasing the possible metal compositions and the associated interactions within a particle. With the increase in possible metal combinations and compositions, theoretical methods can provide assistance in understanding reaction mechanisms or pre-screen metal combinations for their catalytic activity. Machine learning methods can additionally reduce the computational cost of such calculations, but the lack of extensive databases for trimetallic particles hampers their application, requiring the calculationof accurate databases using first-principles methods.

In this work, the composition and formation of a trimetallic CuAu/Pt surface, the adsorption of O, H, C and CO on this surface, and the dissociation of O2 and H2 was investigated using density-functional theory and the nudged elastic band method. The Pt-coated CuAu surface was found to form at least one monolayer of Pt in various configurations, ranging from highly ordered to disordered with similar stability. The adsorption of CO and O2 was found to occur on the top and bridge sites, respectively, whilst H2 was found to adsorb dissociatively with no discernible energy barrier. The dissociation of oxygen on the surface resulted in molecular oxygen adsorbing on the bridge site and dissociating to atomic oxygen in the hollow site with an energy barrier of 0.22 eV."
Cost reduction potential of demand response from a system perspective,"['Bakker, Wessel']","['Lampropoulos, Ioannis']",2023-04-14T23:00:55Z,EN,['demand response; balancing markets; energy transition; flexibility; smart grid; cost reduction; netherlands; great britain; tso; regression analysis; historical data'],Energy Science,"In 2021, the European Union (EU) had set the ambitious goal of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in 2050. To achieve this goal, the way we use energy needs to change radically, and the shift towards renewable energy sources (RES) has to be made. The electricity grid will face significant challenges due to the shift towards RES such as solar and wind energy, as electricity production will be increasingly intermittent, volatile, and unpredictable. Therefore, one of the main challenges of the energy transition is to constantly keep the balance between the demand and supply of electricity, as this is essential to have a reliable and safe electricity system. Demand response (DR) can potentially provide a cost-efficient alternative for balancing the electricity grid. In contrast to the traditional way of balancing the grid which adjusts the production of electricity, with DR, the demand of electricity is adjusted to match it with the supply.
Electricity grid operators buy flexible capacity on balancing markets to balance the grid. When DR can offer flexible capacity for a lower marginal cost, it has the ability to bid a lower bid price on these markets. This enables grid operators to reduce costs in buying flexible capacity, which can lower the cost of the electricity system.
This research aims to quantify the cost reduction potential of DR from a system perspective. Historical data of balancing markets in Great Britain and the Netherlands are analyzed using regression, correlation, and average bid price analysis to quantify the effect of the participation of DR on the price of flexible capacity. Next to that, opportunities and barriers have been identified in sharing more detailed data of balancing markets to enable this quantification.
The results show that for most balancing markets included in the scope, a significant price reduction is estimated due to the participation of DR. It is estimated that DR bids on average 35% lower than the market average. Next to that, the regression analysis estimated that a 1% higher participation of DR in balancing markets on average leads to a 2.7% lower price for flexible capacity. Looking at the current average participation of DR in the markets included in the scope, it is estimated that the price in these markets has dropped by 10%-20% due to the participation of DR. By extrapolating this, it is estimated that the price reduction of flexible capacity in balancing markets in 2030 ranges from 43% to 71% compared to a situation without the participation of DR.
The results also show that the main opportunities of sharing more detailed data of balancing markets are lower barriers for new market entrants, increased market efficiency, improved reputation for grid operators, and easier identification of DR potential. The main barriers are the extra burden for grid operators, harm of privacy of business, risk of collusion, the political view on regulation and transparency, and the lobby of the industry."

While various ways exist to re-use or recycle plastic waste, they are hard to use on a sufficient scale to deal with the waste. In particular, microplastics and nanoplastics can negatively influence the health of humans, animals, and other organisms. Of the various plastic types produced, polyethylene is the most prominent in terms of production and waste generation. There are some microorganisms that have started to show the capability to (partially) degrade plastics waste, but they are often slow on larger particles, but some show promising results on micro- and nanoplastics. Zalerion maritimum degrades polyethylene under laboratory conditions, with evidence suggesting that it uses polyethylene as a carbon source. However, the mechanisms underlying this degradation of polyethylene are not known. This research proposal aims to identify these mechanisms by identifying the genes involved in degradation of polyethylene and by characterizing their encoding proteins. We will also perform a toxicity test of Z. maritimum for various additives present in polyethylene products. With this research, we will contribute to biological solutions to the growing threat of plastics."

Edible fungi could play an important role in restructuring current agrifood systems due to their balanced nutritional composition and their cost-effective and eco-friendly production. Many fungal species have the potential to be developed into functional food because they are a source of various bioactive compounds which provide health benefits beyond their macro-nutritional value. This review is aimed at giving a broad overview of fungal bioactive compounds beneficial for human health and investigating the potential of fungi as functional foods. In all the major groups of fungal primary and secondary metabolites that were investigated, a wide variety of bioactivities were found. Frequently occurring bioactivities present in almost all biochemical groups include antioxidant, anti-microbial, anti-cancer and immunomodulating activities, as well as benefits for gut-, brain- and cardiovascular health. Although many compounds that are present in fungi have been shown to possess these bioactivities, their actual effects through dietary intake remain insufficiently investigated. As the presence of specific bioactive compounds differs between fungal species, an assessment of an individual species is recommended. Given the rising demand for healthier and sustainable foods, fungi offer great potential to play an important role in future agrifood systems."
Human evaluation of automatically generated classifiers in Mandarin Chinese,"['Bruijn, Amber de']","['Deemter, C.J. van']",2023-04-15T00:00:48Z,EN,['natural language generation; classifiers; Mandarin Chinese; human evaluation'],Artificial Intelligence,"One of the difficulties of artificially generating Mandarin Chinese text is the question of which classifier - a linguistic unit obligatory in numeral expressions - to choose in a given context. Several algorithms for classifier choice have recently been developed and assessed using a corpus-based evaluation. The best-scoring algorithm was a BERT classification model. However, evaluating classifiers based on a corpus provides a conservative score: it classifies each non-matching classifier as incorrect, while native speakers might acknowledge multiple different classifiers as a correct option. Since the ultimate goal of NLG should be the generation of texts that are useful to humans, we decided to perform a human evaluation in addition to the corpus-based one. We conducted two experiments; the first was a standard NLG evaluation, and the second was a more linguistically motivated experiment focusing on only true classifiers (a specific subset of Mandarin classifiers). We found that, according to human readers, BERT consistently performs better than the other models, agreeing with the corpus-based evaluation. However, we found no difference in the evaluation scores between BERT and the human-produced sentences in the corpus. This is remarkable, because the corpus-based evaluation suggests a large gap between BERT’s score and the corpus’ score. This result suggests human readers are more accepting of variations in classifier choice than previously thought."

The two major components of the analysis are 1) the correctness by structure: a choreography fol- lows strict grammar and assumptions and is therefore guaran- teed sound and 2) the choreography is transformed to a Petri net which is checked by an external state explosion tool for proper completion.

Its pathogenesis is associated with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains but also by the ability to evade the immune system recognition mechansims. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a valuable therapeutic alternative against S. aureus that could be used to enhance our host innate immune response, mainly mediated by neutrophils and macrophages. To date, no effective vaccination exists to reduce the prevalence of S. aureus infections. In this study, we investigated the potential of three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting staphylococcal cell wall structures to enhance phagocytosis by human neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. The phagocytic abilities of the two immune cells were assessed both in suspension and adhesion assays, to reflect the different in vitro conditions in which neutrophils and macrophages are usually studied, respectively. Bacteria were opsonized with mAbs, in the presence or absence of complement, and then combined with cells. In suspension, we found that IgG3 mAbs induced greater phagocytosis by both immune cells compared to IgG1 mAbs. The limited phagocytosis induced by IgG1 mAb was mainly attributed to presence of staphylococcal protein A (SpA} and second immunoglobulin-binding protein (Sbi), as revealed by our assay with the knock-out strain. We observed that macrophages’ phagocytic ability was mainly mAb-dependent, while neutrophils phagocytosis was ameliorated by complement presence. Furthermore, we observed that in adhesion non-opsonic mechanisms were also involved in the phagocytosis of both cell types, as opposed to the assays in suspension. In conclusion, we showed that the selected mAbs can enhance phagocytosis by improving bacterial opsonisation. Next, future research should investigate the mAbs influence on the killing efficacy of immune cells and establish a strong basis for development of future vaccine strategies."
The influence of polyI:C during different stages of pregnancy on the development of psychiatric disorders in offspring,"['Coppiëns, Myrthe']","['Groenink, L.']",2023-04-15T00:01:05Z,EN,[],Farmacie,"Psychiatric disorders are known for their high disease burden, even though it is still uncertain what 
exactly causes these disorders. However, it is known that environmental factors such as infections can 
largely influence the developing brain. Previous studies have shown that maternal infections during 
pregnancy increase the risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring, but many specifics still remain to be 
unravelled. It is important to gain more knowledge about this subject in order to improve treatment 
and prevention of psychiatric disorders.
In the current paper, the influence of polyI:C injections in pregnant rats on the development of 
psychiatric disorders in offspring is assessed. We compare two different stages of pregnancy; 
gestational day (GD) 9 - corresponding to the first trimester in humans - and GD15 - corresponding to 
the second trimester. The offspring is analysed based on heart rate variability (HRV) and ultrasonic 
vocalizations (USV) on postnatal days 7 and 14.
The difference in bandwidth of USV’s, as a measure for the complexity of USV’s, showed a significant 
interaction between the treatment day of the pregnant rat and the sex of the offspring. Specifically, 
there was a difference between males and females for treatment at GD9, with a p-value of 0,004. 
Other than that, no significance was found in any variables in both the HRV and the USV 
measurements. However, non-significant correlations in mainly the USV data suggested a difference 
for the interaction of sex and treatment day. Possibly polyI:C at GD9 affects males more, while polyI:C 
at GD15 affects females more.
Possibly there are differences between male and female rat pups regarding HRV and USV’s. No 
significance could be found in the current research to support this idea, but slight differences have 
been observed. Combined with previous research this does indicate that differences could be present. 
Further research is warranted to establish the relationship between the sex of the offspring and 
different moments of maternal immune activation during pregnancy."

In recent times, labour shortages in the healthcare sector, the tight labour market and the ageing population in EU Member States are cause for concern. Simultaneously, we observe an acute influx of (skilled) migration – due to the war in Ukraine and the increase of migration in general. Prior research shows that a solution for the labour shortages in the healthcare sector in many Member States can largely be found in labour migration. Since this is an EU wide problem, solutions might indeed be found outside of the EU. 

Consequently, the effective recognition of TCNs’ healthcare qualifications is important. However, this process is hindered by the current EU policies and practices regarding recognition of TCQs. It is important to analyse and where necessary improve the framework. To the extent that recognition is regulated, it is spread across various instruments on both a national, international and European level. This thesis evaluates the current legal framework for recognition and it considers the Professional Qualifications Directive, European migration legislation and Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs). The aim is to assess the suitability of the framework in addressing the challenges posed by migration to and labour shortages in the EU. Finally, some recommendations are discussed, including a broader scope of application of the PQD, cooperation between Member States and the significance of MRAs in the context of trade agreements."

However, due to its novelty, predictors of its outcome still remain unexplored. The aim of this study is to examine whether Body Mass Index (BMI) and Clinical Impairment at baseline predict treatment outcome at end of treatment, with regard to eating disorder pathology. 

Methods: BMI was measured by the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), as was eating disorder pathology, whilst Clinical Impairment was measured by the Clinical Impairment Assessment questionnaire (CIA). A stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed (N=186), with BMI and CIA scores as predictors and EDE-Q scores as the dependent variable (treatment outcome). Subsequently, the analysis was repeated involving the CIA subscales instead of its total score to examine whether CIA’s different subscales (Social, Cognitive, and Personal impairment) predicted treatment outcome.

Results: Clinical Impairment was found to be a medium positive predictor of eating disorder pathology scores ([β=,422], [p<.001]), and thus, a negative predictor of treatment outcome, meaning that the higher the Clinical Impairment, the greater the eating disorder pathology, and the poorer the outcome will be. The succeeding analysis indicated that only the Personal Impairment subscale is also a medium positive predictor of eating disorder pathology ([β=.431, p<.001]), and consequently, a negative predictor of treatment outcome. 

Conclusion: These encouraging results could be helpful for the clinical BED-diagnosed population, improving the efficacy of treatment by allowing therapists to know in advance which patients are at risk of a poor outcome, and decide whether or not to use this treatment for each specific patient. Since no other studies have been found to investigate Clinical Impairment as a predictor of online GSH-CBT-E treatment outcome regarding eating disorder pathology, further research is needed to generalize and consolidate these findings."

However, the relationship and contribution of these tracts in motor function recovery are still incompletely understood. Pre-clinical studies are needed to elucidate the role and relationship of aMFs in stroke recovery. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can be used as 1) a diagnostic tool to study cortical excitability and integrity of motor tracts or 2) a therapeutic tool to alter cortical excitability. Currently, the effectiveness of repetitive TMS (rTMS) treatment in the clinic shows inconsistent findings on improved cortical activation and motor function. Therefore, further investigation is needed to test the effectiveness of inhibitory versus excitatory rTMS after stroke.
Methods – For the first part of this study, twelve adult female Long-Evans rats were given either a sham or a focal CST lesion to study the contribution of the aMFs on the electrophysiological transmission of motor signals. Action potentials were elicited in the motor cortex with TMS and recorded in the forepaw with needle electromyography to determine the lowest motor threshold (MT) that allowed signal transmission pre-stroke and four times post-stroke. In the second part of this study, 21 male Sprague-Dawley rats with a motor cortex lesion, were given nine rTMS sessions over nine days. They received one of three different rTMS interventions (inhibitory, excitatory and sham (n = 7/group)) to study their effect on motor signal transmission and motor function recovery post-stroke. MT was determined pre-treatment and 1 day and 8 days post-treatment.
Results – Part I: the animals with a CST lesion showed no increase in MT (60.83 ± 5.27) compared to the animals without lesion (60.00 ± 5.47) in the acute phase post-stroke. However, there was a significant increase of MT in the late sub-acute phase (65.33 ± 4.50). Part II: there was difference in MT and motor function between treatment groups.
Conclusions – This study shows that a focal lesion to the CST in the internal capsule does not affect the electrophysiological transmission of motor signals in the acute phase of stroke recovery, whereas it does decrease transmission in the late sub-acute phase. Secondly, this study shows that there is no effect of rTMS treatment on motor signal transmission and motor function in animals with a lesion in the motor cortex. Both these findings lay the groundwork for the improvement of diagnosis and prognosis for personalized therapies of stroke patients to improve their clinical outcome."
Enabling the creation of X-ray patient registries through Deep Neural Networks,"['Acitores Cortina, Jose']","['Schnack, Hugo']",2023-04-18T00:01:17Z,EN,[],Artificial Intelligence,"The objective is to implement a neural network based on previous models like the ResNet/ EfficientNet/ Vision Transformers in order to classify x-rays in three different sets of categories; nine different body part categories, the presence or absence of an instrument, and the presence or absence of a fracture. The datasets consists of 45000 x-rays from the nine different classes, labeled by physicians, for the body part classification matter as well as for the instrument detection. A hip X-ray dataset was used for fracture detection, consisting of 468 patients and also labeled by physicians. The methods used to solve this task consist of the implementation of three different neural networks, the use of transfer learning from the ImageNet dataset, and the fine-tuning of the networks to fit them to our problems. The data underwent normalization and augmentation for both datasets, as well as concatenation for the fracture dataset. After collecting the results, the final model is chosen based on the metrics collected after the testing stage. The Results show great performance for both problems that were trained on the larger dataset. The body part classification problem was solved by the three models almost. Equally, the best model being Efficient Net with a logarithmic loss of 0.1053 and a Cohen Kappa score of 0.9940. For instrument detection, the best model was ResNet101, achieving an AUC of 0.99 with a 95 CI of 0.95-1. Finally, in the proposed proof of concept for fracture detection, the results did not surpass the ones of a professional radiologist, achieving a sensitivity of 0.86, a specificity of 1, and an AUC of 0.93. In conclusion, the results show that the creation of an automated pipeline for the creation of x-rays patient registries is possible and achievable with a low error rate; the main limitation is the lack of labeled data to aid the creation of the given pipeline. Therefore the main challenge is the collaboration of medical staff for the creation of an initial database that can help to complete the work that is often overlooked and avoided.

Methods In this retrospective study, medical records were reviewed from patients admitted between 2019 and 2021 to a tertiary-care hospital located in the Netherlands with a staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection. All patients older than 18 years, without pre-existing renal failure were included. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine the association between clinical, demographical, and biochemical factors with the occurrence of acute kidney injury.
Results A total of 158 patients were included in whom 166 staphylococcus aureus bacteremia events occurred. According to the RIFLE criteria, acute kidney injury developed in 49 (30%) patients. Etiologically, acute kidney injury occurred due to pre-renal causes in 27 patients (56%), drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis in 7 (14%) patients, acute tubular necrosis in 4 (8%) patients, and renal causes in 4 (8%), of which 3 (6%) immune-related and 1 (2%) thromboembolic. Occurrence of acute kidney injury was associated with higher 30-day -and 1-year mortality, (OR 6.213, p <0.001) and (OR 3.961, p <0.001). Risk factors significantly associated with acute kidney injury in the multivariate analysis were age ≥ 65 (OR 2.353, p =0.039), IC/MC admission (OR 4.408, p =0.001), sepsis (OR 2.653, p =0.021) and severe infective focus (device-related and/or endocarditis) (OR 3.108, p =0.010).
Conclusion In this study conducted, acute kidney injury occurred in 30% of patients. Older age, sepsis, IC/MC admission, and focus of infection were identified as indepented risk factors in patients admitted with methicilin sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Future research should focus on describing the distribution of causal mechanism leading to AKI and identifying etiology-associated risk factors to detect high-risk patients prone to develop AKI. Thereby aiming to improve early detection, prevention and management of acute kidney injury and reduce kidney-related morbidity, mortality, and clinical burden."

Worth more than gold,"['Fliert, Simon van de']","['Gatt, A.']",2023-04-20T00:00:44Z,EN,['Transformers; Natural Language Generation; mT5; Ecco; BertViz; Model Diagnostics'],Artificial Intelligence,"Research within Natural Language Generation is evolving rapidly as new models are consistently reported to outperform previous works based on popular metrics, such as n-gram-based BLEU and ROUGE or model-based, such as BLUERT and BERTScore. Nonetheless, it is still unclear why state-of-the-art models make errors, thus making it difficult to identify a viable solution. This project aims to help fill this gap by performing model diagnostics on the mT5 transformer and attempting to uncover the origin of errors within Transformers. The mT5-base, T5-base, Yeb Havinga’s T5-base Dutch-case, and BART models are fine-tuned on the RDF-to-text dataset called CACAPO. Following this, the mT5-base’s generations are manually and automatically reviewed using evaluation metrics BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, BERTScore, BARTScore, and PARENT. Additional experiments are conducted where CACAPO’s training set is augmented, and underspecified input is provided with additional contextual information. These experiments led to several insights. First, observations are made involving CACAPO, where the reverse engineering nature highlighted the difficulties of capturing all contextually relevant data in the input. Furthermore, CACAPO often leaves relevant information from the reference text out of the input, as no attribute could be connected to the corresponding value. However, experimentation showed that this is too restricted and that CACAPO could be extended using inter-subject attributes. Furthermore, data augmentation experiments highlighted the need for a structured augmentation method for multilingual use cases. Following this, experimentation showed it to be more beneficial to add contextual data to underspecified inputs compared to augmenting the data. This also highlights the need for an improved content selection process, so that all contextually relevant information in the reference text is captured in the input data. Another observation was made where a model trained on improved input data performs better during the inference stage, even when the input data during inference was underspecified. This indicates that purely improving the specificity of the training set could lower the number of errors made by the model. Moreover, comparisons between Dutch and English records showed that Dutch records improved more due to the additional input data, which could be caused by the amount of training data the model has seen during both pre-training and fine-tuning. This could highlight a correlation between improved contextual input data and the necessary training set size, where smaller data set sizes might be usable if the input data had all contextually relevant information. Another possible reason could be the difference in sentence complexity, where the majority of Dutch records are relatively simple, whereas a large part of English records is complex. This could indicate that an improved specification of input data could be more impactful for relatively simple texts, highlighted by the increase in performance for Dutch records, but lacking increase of BARTScore performance for the English records. Furthermore, analysis between languages showed no difference in error counts, showing that error types are consistent between English and Dutch records. However, the severity of these errors was not captured in this project. Finally, each model showed difficulty capturing the correct order of attributes, thereby generating incorrect conclusions. This is likely due to the lacking relational information in the CACAPO dataset for end-to-end models."
Pediatric Oncology: Looking for Similarities Between the Mechanisms Leading to Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Neuroblastoma,"['Herwijnen, Daniël van']","['Hehir-Kwa, Jayne']",2023-04-18T00:01:25Z,EN,['ALL;NB;Pediatric Cancer; multipolar division; telomere shortening; polyploidy; aneuploidy'],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"Most adult cancer is caused by acquiring mutations over time, but much less is known about the
causes of childhood cancers. neuroblastoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia are amongst the
most common pediatric cancers. Both have a subgroup that present with very similar characteristics, which could indicate that they might share a mechanistic origin. In contrast, the High
Risk subgroup of neuroblastoma has a poor outcome and is much different from Low Risk neuroblastoma. In this review, what is known about the mechanisms of these two types of pediatric
cancer have been compared to find similarities and differences. These can help researchers to
formulate new hypotheses to better study pediatric cancer. A mechanism these tumors might share
is an error in cell division, causing the chromosomes to be incorrectly segregated. This results in
number of chromosomes per cell deviating from the normal 46. However, it also seems likely that
neuroblastoma (NB) is caused by whole genome duplication and subsequently loses chromosomes.
The High Risk subgroup of neuroblastoma is driven by amplification of the oncogene MYCN. MYCN
causes activation of telomerase, which causes telomere maintenance. Telomere maintenance
is required to prevent the loss of DNA at the chromosome ends. It is unclear what causes MYCN
amplification and it has been proposed that this is due to the shortening of telomeres, which causes
chromosome fusion resulting in complex DNA damage"

follow a target distribution has been studied in [Kryven, 2022]. However, an efficient implementation
is missing. Here, we develop methods that implement their algorithm. On the one hand, we develop
a method that implement the general case, where no structure of the edge weights is known and
hence they have to be stored. This is also done for the binary case, where edges are either allowed
or disallowed. These methods are expensive due to them requiring at least O(n
2
) storage and
O(n

), simply, due to storing the edge weights. On the other hand, we focus on the case where
the edge weights are distances and instead implement a method where the edge weights do not
have to be stored. This implementation requires O(m) storage. Whereas the run time is unclear,
it is estimated to be O(m
9
8 dmax). In the process of developing these methods, the expected run
time of the case without edge weights is improved from O(mdmax) to O(m). Next, we explore
an alternative way of sampling the edges, namely such that all vertices have an equal chance of
being sampled. This gives more control over the edge weight distributions of individual vertices,
while still outputting a graph with the desired target distribution. Lastly, we develop a method for
reconstructing the Dutch company network as an internship at Statistics Netherlands."

However, the effects are difficult to attribute to the Inhibitory Learning Model (ILM). In the ILM, the importance of expectancy violation during exposure is emphasized, meaning the occurrence of a mismatch between feared and actual outcomes. This study investigated potential working mechanisms of VRET by exploring the role of expectancy violation and self-efficacy. Methods: Participants reported their feared expectancies related to public speaking, and conducted 5 presentations in VR, split over two sessions. A total of 18 participants were randomly assigned to the experimental or control condition. Exclusively in the experimental condition participants were informed that the VR audience was unable to react to the presentations. Results: We found that PSA decreased based on one instrument but increased based on another instrument. Additionally, the magnitude of expectancy violation did not differ between treatment conditions. Interestingly, self-efficacy improvements were exclusively found in the experimental condition. Conclusion: The effects of VRET were not explicitly explained by the working mechanisms of expectancy violation and self-efficacy. However, there are indications that VRET in combination with a safe learning environment could be used to build self-efficacy."

Een onderzoek naar alternatieve beloningsmogelijkheden voor  werknemers in de ouderenzorg,"['Fahner, Willem']","['Dortants, Marianne']",2023-04-25T10:00:56Z,NL,['Zorgmedewerkers'],Bestuurs- en organisatiewetenschap,"Vele prognoses tonen dat er een groot personeelstekort in de zorg komt. De begroting voor zorg- en verpleegkosten is echter niet ongelimiteerd. Daaruit is de vraag gerezen: kunnen zorgmedewerkers (maximaal MBO niveau 4) ook op een andere manier dan in geld voor hun arbeid worden gecompenseerd? De met dit onderzoek vergaarde kennis kan bijdragen aan het denken over het introduceren van een niet-financieel, additioneel beloningsgedeelte voor de ouderenverzorger(s). Niet-financieel wil in dit onderzoek zeggen: niet in geld en dat hetgeen aangeboden wordt een zo gering mogelijk beslag legt op de financiële middelen: minder dan het overmaken van meer geld naar de zorgwerker. 
Er is een kwalitatief onderzoek verricht en het eerste, theoretische deel van dit verslag gaat in op beloningssoorten, -visies en arbeidsecomomische (keuze)theorieën. De analyse mondt uit in gerichte aandacht voor het commentaar van Akerlof en Shiller (2009) op de rationele keuzetheorie en voor de zogenaamde doelmatigheidsloontheorie (Akerlof & Yellen, 1986). Respectievelijk ziet dit op de niet-economische aspecten en drijfveren die een rol spelen bij het aangaan van een economische verbintenis en de loontheorie die een ruimere compensatie biedt dan hetgeen bij andere werkgevers het geval is. Die mogelijkheid bestaat nu nauwelijks omdat de CAO branchebreed geldt. Met het aanbieden van niet-financiële beloningsmogelijkheden kan mogelijk de doelstelling van het doelmatigheidsloon wel worden bereikt.  
De 21 gehouden interviews geven zicht op de manier waarop de zorgwerker met beloningsonderwerpen bezig is. Er blijken niettemin diverse niet of deels benutte mogelijkheden naar voren te komen op het gebied van niet-financieel belonen. Het eten in instellingen, is een van de onderwerpen daarin. Er blijkt dat het dagbesteden aan verse maaltijdbereiding niet alleen de eetlust vergroot maar dat het meegeven aan of mee laten eten van de verzorger als belonend wordt ervaren. Tevens gaat men op deze manier voedselverspilling tegen. Ook het bieden van fitnessmogelijkheden kan niet alleen aansluiten op de persoonlijke interesse en een gezonde leefstijl van de zorgwerker, maar het daarbij integreren van fysiotherapeutische onderdelen draagt bij aan het terugdringen van ziekteverzuim als gevolg van fysieke overbelasting. Een derde conclusie laat zien dat bij het aanbieden van een opleiding belangrijk is of deze aansluit bij primair het organisatiebelang of bij een geuite (belonings)wens. 
Gelet op het hoge percentage vrouwen komt het organiseren van kinderopvang in (de nabijheid van) de zorginstelling tegemoet aan wensen. Tot slot komt het organiseren van teamuitjes niet alleen het werkplezier ten goede maar ook de interne organisatie waar het om planning en afstemming gaat. Tevens draagt een plezierige band met collega’s bij aan verlooppreventie. 
In dit verslag worden nog meer niet-financiële beloningswensen genoemd. Een bijlage (nr. 1) bevat gespreksuitkomsten die minder aansluitend waren bij de onderzoeksvraag maar die wel belangrijke inzichten bieden voor verbeteringen in de sector waar het gaat om planning en personeelsbeleid."

They contain a variety of 
proteins and also different lipid species. Undoubtedly, there are many interactions between 
lipids and between lipids and proteins. Yet, methods to study these interactions on an 
atomistic scale are lacking. Methodologies that allow the study of the membrane on the 
level of atoms will spark the discovery of drugs and antimicrobials that humanity direly 
needs due to rampant antimicrobial resistance. In this work we present isotopically 
labelled phospholipids (13C, 15N and 19F) for solid-state NMR spectroscopy (ssNMR). These 
probes allow the study of biologically relevant and complex membranes at atomic 
resolution without affecting natural membrane physics, while conventional methodologies 
would. We demonstrate the versatility of these probes by studying the mode of action of 
the lipopeptide antibiotics daptomycin and A54145, and the lantibiotic cinnamycin. We 
found that both these distinct antibiotic classes can form aggregates on bacterial 
membranes. This shows for the first time that oligomerisation as a mode of action expands 
beyond antibiotics that target the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II [185-187] and, thus, 
suggests that this is a general mode of action for membrane targeting antibiotics.
Furthermore, we describe a straightforward isotopic labelling approach for daptomycin and 
A54145 from its producing streptomycete. Together with the isotopically labelled lipid 
probes, this will allow the future study of the full lipopeptide-lipid complex, which would 
shed light on their puzzling mode of action after more than 40 years of active research. 
Taken together, the lipid probes presented in this work allow for the exploration of complex 
membranes at an unprecedented atomic resolution, providing novel strategies for the 
investigation of the mode of action of drugs and antimicrobials, and others interactions 
within the membrane."

	We included all patients with a CCC or heterotopic continent pouch that underwent a urodynamic study in the University Medical Centre Utrecht between January and March 2023. We conducted a stoma pressure profile (SPP) at the beginning, thereafter we placed the catheter on the point of the highest pressure measured during the SPP. Here we conducted the continuous stoma pressure (CSP), at the end of the study we conducted a second SPP. The primary outcome is the technical feasibility of the pressure profilometries. The secondary outcome is the description of these profilometries. 
	We included 14 patients, in whom we conducted 14 SPPs and 13 CSPs. The average maximal stomal pressure in SPP-2 was higher than in SPP-1, but no significant difference was found (P=.429). The average maximal stomal pressure in SPP-1, SPP-2 and CSP was higher in patients without stress incontinence compared to stress incontinent patients, however no significant difference was found. 
	It is feasible to perform a stoma profilometry in adult patients. The mean pressures in SPP-2 were higher than in SPP-1, and the mean pressures in stress incontinent patients were lower. The results could help us in understanding the continence mechanism of the CCC and treatment of complications."

Additionally, most scholars delve into a very text-focused approach or an approach that uses ethnography, but rarely both at the same time. This current research will address both of these issues by using a textual analysis and participant observation to learn how players can use Guild Wars 2’s mechanics and features to create a character identity for representational role-play. The analysis showed that a character's class and race influence a lot, since it both enables certain mechanics while limiting others. Once a character has been made, the player can customize their character primarily through armor and weapons, which can be dyed and/or hidden. To express the identity of their character, players can use the chat and emotes, of which the custom emote had the most interesting use. Through the participant observation, it became clear that players often wish to play different or multiple characters in ways that are not facilitated by dedicated mechanics, so they have to get creative with the custom emote or other mechanics. Ludic elements were also often factors that restricted a player’s creative freedom because a player is barely able to dress up their character if they play exclusively ludic. Lastly, players would sometimes take their role-play outside of the game if they could not express their creativity properly within the game."

Method: TNFα inhibitor-naive RA patients treated with TNFα inhibitors were included in this
retrospective cohort study. The primary endpoint was the difference between Disease Activity Score 28
with CRP (DAS28-CRP) at the start of TNFα inhibitor treatment and after 3-12 months (ΔDAS28-CRP).
Multivariable linear regression was used to determine differences in ΔDAS28-CRP. A sub-group analysis
based on BMI was done to determine effect modification of BMI on ΔDAS28-CRP. Drug survival was
analysed using the log rank test. Differences in reasons to stop TNFα inhibitor treatment was analysed

not significant (p = 0,116).
Conclusion: Biological sex seems to not have an association of TNFα inhibitor treatment response in

"Does involvement of the supervising general practitioner impact urgency
allocation and diagnosis of acute coronary artery syndrome in patients with
chest discomfort who contact out-of-hours primary care?","['Leclair, Dylan']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-05-10T23:00:52Z,EN,[],Geneeskunde,"Abstract
Background: Primary care triage nurses use a semi-automatic decision support tool called the
‘Netherlands Triage Standard’ for telephone triage during out of office hours. In some cases, the triage
nurse consults the supervising general practitioner (GP) to decide on the urgency allocation. The aim of
this study is to evaluate the relation between consulting the supervising GP and (i) the urgency
allocation and (ii) the diagnosis of ACS and other life-threatening events (LTEs) in patients calling the
OHC-PC with chest discomfort.
Methods: Patient call characteristics and follow-up data were retrieved from recorded phone calls, and
GPs’ electronic medical files, respectively. Patients in whom the supervising GP was involved were
compared with patients in whom not. Logistic regression was used to analyse data and calculate odds
ratios (ORs) for the relation between involvement of the supervising GP and urgency allocation and the
diagnosis of ACS/other LTE or ACS alone.
Results: 2,195 patients were included in this study. In 1,148 (52.2%) the supervising GP was consulted,
and there were no clear differences in symptoms with patients in whom the GP was not consulted,
however they were on average three years younger and had more comorbidities. This resulted if
compared to patients in whom the supervising GP was not involved in a higher urgency allocation (OR
1.26 (95% CI 1.06-1.50)), but a lower -non-significant- occurrence of ACS or other LTE (OR 0.79 (95% CI
0.63-1.01)) or ACS alone (OR 0.79 (95% CI 0.61-1.03)). This relation was significant after correction for
age and sex (adjusted OR 0.75 (95% CI 0.59-0.96), and 0.75 (95% CI 0.57-0.98), respectively). These
results were mainly driven by females; OR of ACS/other LTE in ‘consulted’ group 0.68 (95% CI 0.47-
0.98)), males OR 0.86 (95% CI 0.63-1.19).
In the 215 (9.8%) patients who eventually showed to have an ACS and in whom the supervising GP was
involved, less often a high urgency was allocated (OR 0.32 (95% CI 0.17-0.61)); females OR 0.24 (95% CI
0.08-0.69), males OR 0.39 (95% CI 0.17-0.87). In both the ‘consulted’ group with ACS as in the ‘not
consulted’ ACS group, the NTS-generated low urgency cases were overruled to a high urgency just as
often (23.9% vs 22.7%). The NTS-generated urgency was downgraded to low urgent in 2 cases (2.8%) in
the ‘consulted’ group and in no case (0.0%) in the ‘not consulted’ group.
Conclusion: In half of the patients, the supervising GP was involved, and they had similar symptoms as
patients in those in whom no consultation took place. These patients were diagnosed less with an ACS
but received more often a high urgency allocation. However, this discrepancy was completely driven by
patients who had no ACS, more so in females. This suggests that patients in whom the GP was consulted
were more difficult to triage resulting in relative over-triage of those without ACS or other LTE."
Understanding the evolution of electricity networks. Modeling a century of Dutch and Hungarian transmission grid growth,"['Baardman, Rens']","['Gibescu, Madeleine']",2023-05-10T23:01:06Z,EN,['networks; network analysis; topology; electricity; transmission grids; power grids; vulnerability; network resilience; network efficiency; network growth; network modeling; network evolution; network dataset'],Energy Science,"Transmission grids can be modeled as networks, with the substations and plants as the nodes, and transmission lines as the edges. The present state of such a network is the result of a complex process of network growth and development, often spanning more than a century in time. Due to a lack of data on the historical state of transmission grids, it has been difficult to study this process.
In this thesis, we present a unique new dataset of the historical development of the Dutch transmission grid, reconstructed from hundreds of old maps. Using network analysis, we analyze the network evolution of Dutch grid and compare it an existing dataset of the Hungarian grid. After rapid early network growth, the networks mature in the 1970s, after which many important network characteristics stabilize. We also find that both networks exhibit strong preferential attachment, meaning that nodes with higher degrees are more likely to receive new connections. This leads to an exponential degree distribution.
We use a synthetic network generator to try to model the observed growth. Even though the model used is simple, the simulated networks comes close to the real-world evolution on a number of network characteristics. However, since there is no preferential attachment assumed, the degree distribution is concentrated at the lower degrees.
We also track the evolution of the network vulnerability, looking both at the topological vulnerability and the change in the optimal power flow after node removal. We find that the topological vulnerability of the real-world networks also stabilizes after the 1970s, although the Dutch networks vulnerability is higher than that of the Hungarian network. The synthetic networks however do not show a drop in vulnerability, and vulnerability stays much higher than those found in the real-world networks.

The Utrecht Cardiovascular Cohort","['Sun, Qi']","['Bots, Michiel']",2023-05-10T23:00:58Z,EN,['cardiovascular health; LS7; LE8; UCC-CVRM'],Epidemiology,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading public health concern, and its epidemiological status is a significant worldwide issue. In 2010 and 2022, the American heart association (AHA) published two guidelines with individual scoring systems, 'Life's simple seven' (LS7) and 'Life's essential eight' (LE8), for helping people assess and prevent CVDs. Many articles have reported the general population's risk factors for LS7 and LE8. However, few studies considered LS7 and LE8 in the patient population. Besides, only some articles compared these two frameworks. Thus, my research is to describe ideal cardiovascular health distribution in the UCC-CVRM cohort, identify which factors relate to ideal cardiovascular health distribution in patients, detect which variables can be associated with LS7 or LE8 assessment, and compare LS7 with LE8 classification situation in this study population. The results showed that based on LS7, 5.2%, 58.5%, and 36.3% of patients were assigned to low, moderate, and ideal CVH levels, respectively. Correspondingly, the proportions by LE8 were 12.5%, 66.8%, and 12.7%. Education level was related to higher LS7 and LE8 scores. CVD history and family history of CVD were associated with decreased LE8 scores. The blood pressure (BP) component score was the lowest among the three CVH levels in LS7 and LE8. 74.8 percent of patients were assigned to the same CVH level in LS7 and LE8. Furthermore, LE8 can more precisely categorize patients, demonstrating its superiority in clinical practice. So we suggest that patients should focus on blood pressure management and LE8 should be replaced LS7 in clinical practice as the new cardiovascular assessment guideline."
Open Innovation in Accelerator Programs,"['Viveen, Lennart']","['Rijnsoever, Frank van']",2023-05-10T23:01:08Z,EN,['Open Innovation; Business Accelerators; Business Models'],Innovation Sciences,"Successful startup growth can bring economic and social benefits to society. Entrepreneurs, however,
face many challenges, often related to a lack of resources, knowledge and network. To overcome these
challenges startups can participate in an accelerator program, organised by a business accelerator. Here,
startups receive support, mainly through network introductions and workshops, to enhance their
business capabilities. However, where business accelerators induce developments to a startup’s business
exactly and to what extent they add to the contribution of the startup’s personal network was yet
unidentified and determined in this research.

As a business accelerator aims to induce business-related developments, startups within this research
are examined on developments in their business model. These developments are induced by external
sources that originate from outside the startup’s organisational boundaries, either from their personal or
the accelerator’s network. This represents an inbound open innovation process that induces
developments in a startup’s business model.

The research follows a comparative case study design, comparing 23 European, energy-related startups.
Fifteen accelerated to eight non-accelerated. The author collected qualitative data to identify all business
model developments that were induced by external actors. The business model developments were
categorised according to the business model canvas components. This enabled the author to create a
structured overview of all developments that were induced, to which startups, by which actor and
whether this actor originated from the accelerator or the startup’s personal network.

Business accelerators only contribute meaningfully to the key partners and key activities components of
startups through their mentors, their legitimacy and fundraising support. For key resources, participation
in an accelerator program is beneficial, but startups are in principle capable of developing this
component with their personal network. In the other components accelerator program participation did
not make a difference. The most influential external actors appeared to be the accelerator itself, investors
and universities.

The results show that the inbound open innovation process, facilitated by an accelerator program,
provides additional developments on the left side of a startup’s business model canvas, compared to
developments induced by their personal network. This refers to the internal management of their
organisation.

Business accelerators do contribute to the development of startups that participate in their program, but
they are not decisive for startup success. As they only facilitate additional developments in two
components they do not provide as much value as they aim to."

increased awareness for the (economic) dependence of countries. This study attempts to
identify the direction and size of the relationship between the foreign policy strategy and the
economic dependency factor of a buffer state. With a case study on six buffer states, this
study answers the following question: how does a foreign policy strategy affect the economic
dependence of a buffer state? The research question is divided into two parts. First, it is
established whether the economic dependency of foreign policies differ via the KruskalWallis test and the Dunn test. The second part elaborates on the contrasts per foreign policy.
These differences are analysed by a regression and a yearly relative change in economic
dependency. Three conclusions are drawn: the foreign policy strategies differ significantly
from each other, there is a positive relationship between the predilection & third-power
strategy and the economic dependency factor, and the volatility of economic dependency is
the largest in the third-power strategy and the smallest in the multivector approach. The
positive relationships show that an implementation of those policies increase the economic
dependence of the buffer state. A higher volatility of this economic dependence can result in a
higher volatility of tax revenue, an unstable domestic economy, and inefficient interest rates.
Policy makers of buffer states but also foreign companies, investors, or immigrants looking to
join the buffer state must incorporate the implications of the chosen foreign policy into their
personal consideration. Further research should be conducted on this relationship to simplify
this consideration for the involved parties"
Dynamic Stacking of Energy & Power Portfolios on the Dutch Market,"['Garrood, Tash']","['Fumagalli, Elena']",2023-05-10T23:01:00Z,EN,"['FCR, DA, Imbalance Settlement, Linear Programming, MILP, optimization']",Energy Science,"The thesis is written with Spectral, an Amsterdam-based Energy Consultancy who manage assets for several clients with flexibility to trade electricity products due to portfolios of energy storage and renewable energy systems
(ESS & VRES) at commercial sites such as business parks. The cost of investment for these assets is high, meanwhile, grid connections are limited and
therefore self-sufficiency is becoming increasingly necessary. As such, there
is growing interest in ways to ensure these assets profitability can be maximised. Recent literature suggests that trading dynamically across multiple
markets could increase profits. The aim of the thesis is therefore to build a
model whereby any client portfolio of assets can be modelled with accompanying production and load data to find optimal trading strategies across various
markets. Spectral has experience trading on the day-ahead and FCR markets,
so these will be used as the model starting point, while also considering imbalance settlement payments. The research finds that trading on DA with FCR
is the most profitable, with FCR being the primary revenue stream. Furthermore, parameters such as curtailment of VRES, grid import and export limits
and battery cycling can also be analysed and provide useful information for
further economic analyses such as development of the business case for grid

Dynamic capabilities conducive to scaling product-service-systems: How product companies can deal with internal barriers to scaling. The case of Fairphone Easy.,"['Kestler, Rene']","['Bidmon, Christina']",2023-05-26T00:00:46Z,EN,['product-service-systems; scaling; dynamic capabilities'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Unsustainable business practices have led to dramatic sustainability pressures for modern society in
the form of climate change and resource scarcity. A potential solution to meet the challenges of the
climate crisis are product-service-systems (PSSs), which are combined product and service offerings
that together can fulfil customer needs. Through alternative scenarios of product use can PSSs
decrease the consumption of products and therefore hold the promise of delivering economic and
environmental benefits. However, to accelerate the sustainability transition, PSSs must reach an
increasing number of beneficiaries. While prior literature largely focused on the design and
implementation of PSSs, scaling them has only been researched to a minor extent. However, there are
only a few examples of upscaled PSSs, which suggests that scaling PSSs is challenging. Therefore, the
aim of this study was to investigate how product companies can scale PSSs. It has widely been
accepted that scaling PSSs is hindered by internal and external barriers. While external barriers have
received large attention in the literature, internal barriers have been less researched. To broaden the
understanding of the internal barriers firms face and how they can be addressed, this thesis took a
qualitative approach. It studied the case of Fairphone, a Dutch smartphone manufacturer that had
recently introduced a sustainable PSS. Adopting the dynamic capabilities (DC) lens, using an inductive
coding strategy, the research analyzed 17 semi-structured interviews to identify the DCs conducive to
early-stage scaling. By matching the DCs with the barriers they help to address, the study found that
some DCs enable product companies to reduce or remove barriers, while other DCs prevent barriers
from occurring in the first place. The study identified the combinations of DCs that enable product
companies to adopt a service-centered mindset, design fully integrated PSSs, plan and execute the
service rollout, reduce operational costs, as well as identify and pursue cost-effective ways for scaling.
An interesting finding from the case study is that product companies need to foster sensing, seizing,
and reconfiguring capabilities simultaneously, as only in combination can they effectively address the
identified barriers. Future research could focus on identifying the DCs that are conducive to scaling
more mature PSSs that have already moved from initial experimentation to upscaling."
"Evaluating the chronic pain collaborative movement therapy
consultation","['Landman, David']","['Wijck, B. van']",2023-05-26T00:00:43Z,EN,[],Geneeskunde,"Introduction
Chronic pain is a prevalent and complex health problem with a significant impact on patients' well-being. The collaborative movement therapy consultation (CMTC), offered by the Division of Pain Medicine at the University Medical Center Utrecht, aims to provide individualized treatment for chronic pain. This study investigates the characteristics of patients who may benefit from this therapy.
Method
This retrospective observational cohort study examined chronic pain patients who attended a CMTC. The patients pain scores are analyzed and participants' characteristics were summarized in a baseline table and assessed for significance using t-tests and Pearson correlations. To evaluate the consultation's effectiveness in managing chronic pain, a minimum clinically important difference was set on two points of pain score decrease.
Results
A total of 212 patients were analyzed. The lowest, highest, and combined VAS score all showed a decrease. However, none of the scores reached the MCID threshold. Head pain, other pre-consultation treatment, and longer pain duration were associated with less pain reduction.
Discussion
This research study found that participating in the CMTC led to a significant reduction in pain scores after 3 months, although it did not meet the MCID threshold. Movement therapy have been shown to be effective for chronic pain. Head pain, prior treatments, benefited less for the CMTC. The study's limitations included the lack of a control group and variability time of in questionnaire completion. Further research is needed to explore treatment adherence and specific types of movement therapy within CMTC."

On the validity of standardised faces in face perception research","['Siemensma, Friso']","['Hooge, Ignace']",2023-05-25T02:01:05Z,EN,[],Applied Cognitive Psychology,"Many studies in face perception research use standardised facial stimuli: digitally manipulated facial images used in eye tracking experiments studying facial viewing behaviour and emotion perception. With technological innovations in eye tracking equipment inviting us to study faces out in the wild, the present study investigated this seeming trend in research literature, identifying a predilection for stimulus control as an underlying line of reasoning for standardisation, alongside a potential problem if viewing behaviour showing visual preference for the eyes found in standardised stimuli, does not generalise to viewing behaviour showing visual preference for the eyes in non-standardised, “real” faces. As typical viewing behaviour in the literature shows the eyes have a strong attention maintaining capacity, a data analysis using a range of unusual non-standardised stimuli was conducted, estimating relative dwell time to the eyes. Results showed that while viewing behaviour differed between standardised and non-standardised stimuli, these differences were minor and did not substantially differ from results found in face perception literature. If additional studies confirm this generalisability, increasing the use of non-standardised stimuli could prove useful in in bridging the transition of face perception from the lab to the wild."
Mobilising academic research for transformative change,"['Veer, Menno']","['Heimeriks, Gaston']",2023-05-26T00:00:51Z,EN,[],Innovation Sciences,"In order to face the societal challenges of today and tomorrow, governments look for innovations that 
could help in solving these challenges. In recent years a third frame on these governmental policies has 
been formed, namely transformative policy. This study examines a mission-driven knowledge ecosystem 
(KES) as an example of how knowledge can be organised for transformative change. It is researched what 
the influence of such a mission-driven KES is on the credibility cycle of an academic PhD researcher. This 
results in the following research question: What is the influence of a mission-driven knowledge ecosystem 
on the credibility cycle of an academic researcher?
Literature on directionality, KESs and the credibility cycle is used to answer this research question. The 
concept of directionality is used to explain how they play a role in a mission-driven KES. Literature on KES 
is used to form a framework that can be used to study a mission-driven KES. Lastly, literature on the 
credibility cycle is used to study the research process of a researcher. 
A case study was carried out on the mission-driven KES on CATO. CATO was organised around Carbon 
Capture and Storage (CCS) knowledge, ranging from technical knowledge of the technology to public 
perception of CCS. A document analysis was carried out to study this mission-driven KES and interviews 
were done with PhD researchers, supervisors, coordinators and the director to get insights into PhD 
research in CATO.
CATO had several mechanisms and characteristics of a mission-driven KES. There was a group of 
heterogenous actors working together in a social network to formulate new knowledge in the field of CCS. 
PhD researchers encountered actors from industry or researchers from other disciplines they would 
normally not interact with. This resulted in research that was aligned with the mission of the ecosystem 
and collaboration was induced. Furthermore, the credibility cycle of PhD researchers changed to a 
credibility cycle which was, next to the academic needs, also focused on societal and industrial needs. 
All in all, a mission-driven KES significantly influences the credibility cycle of a PhD researcher. However, 
it must be closely monitored if the goal and mission of the KES are truly beneficial for society. In the case 
of CATO the role of industrial incumbents was more significant than the role of NGOs. The public 
controversy around CCS shows the importance of the involvement of NGOs and society in the formation 
of a mission-driven KES."

A better understanding of what mechanism is at heart of the sex-differential liability for ASD appears crucial for the understanding of ASD etiology and may aid the development of novel treatment approaches. Here, literature is summarized that suggests the amygdala plays a central role in the mechanism underlying the sex-differential liability for ASD. Hypothalamic neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (VP) affect amygdala function and have sexually dimorphic roles in social behavior. Furthermore, ASD-associated OXT and VP system aberrances appear to affect amygdala function, in part in a sex-dependent manner. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that OXT and VP signaling in the amygdala are key factors underlying the sex-differential liability for ASD. Further research into the relation between OXT and VP aberrances, amygdala function, sex and social deficits in ASD is however warranted."
Economic potential of Demand Response for office buildings in the Netherlands,"['Aarts, Anne']","['Gibescu, Madeleine']",2023-05-26T00:00:54Z,EN,['Demand Response; flexibility; building modelling;'],Energy Science,"To combat imbalances in the electricity grid and support the integration of renewable energy sources, demand response (DR) is increasingly being looked at as a key solution. Electricity consumers can change their electricity consumption pattern based on dynamic prices to help stabilize the grid and reduce their energy bill. This study focuses on the economic potential of demand response for office buildings in the Netherlands. A model of an office building has been developed in Matlab, containing a thermal model of the building and models of the Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system, employees' electric vehicles (EVs) and employees' laptops. These assets can be operated flexibly, in reaction to dynamic prices. The office buys its electricity on the Dutch day-ahead market and can subsequently also trade on the automatic frequency restoration reserve (aFRR) markets. Multiple control strategies have been considered: a reference control strategy, a rule-based strategy and a Model Predictive Controller, with the objective of minimizing the electricity costs while maintaining indoor comfort and respecting battery capacity boundaries. Running yearly simulations with various variations in input, a number of conclusions can be drawn: 1) The economic profitability is highly dependant on the simulation year. Profits of DR are at least ten times higher in 2022 than 2019, due to higher electricity prices and increased variability in the price. 2) The HVAC is best controlled by the MPC, but the MPC leads mainly to energy consumption reduction instead of consumption pattern shifting. This combination can also have high investment costs, although this strongly depends on the HVAC hard- and software already installed in the office. 3) EVs have a lot of DR economic potential for office buldings as investments are low and the electricity consumption is high and easily shiftable. Additionally, the EV penetration level is expected to rise quickly the coming years in the Netherlands. 4) Laptop DR is barely profitable in the day-ahead market, but performs well in the aFRR market. 5) Total electric vehicle DR profit in 2022 is around 7,500 euros, and HVAC DR profits lie at 2,000 euro for a 4,000 square meter office. Considering the revenue of a 4,000 sq. m office is in the millions, the profits are not enormous but there is economic potential and the profits will increase with higher EV penetration."

Achtergrond Klinische studies bij de pediatrische populatie hebben aanzienlijke limitaties als gevolg van praktische en ethische beperkingen. Sommige beperkingen, zoals de beperkte mogelijkheden voor gegevensverzameling bij pediatrische patiënten, kunnen gedeeltelijk worden ondervangen door het uitvoeren van extrapolatiestudies op basis van modellerings- en simulatietechnieken.
Doelstelling Het doel van deze studie is na te gaan of modellering en simulatie een rol spelen in de benefit risk discussie van pediatrische geneesmiddelen die tussen 26 juli 2008 en 10 januari 2022 zijn goedgekeurd.
Methode Dit is een retrospectieve studie en de European Public Assessment Reports (EPAR's) van het Europees Geneesmiddelenbureau, of EMA, zijn de primaire bron voor dit onderzoek. Elk geneesmiddel wordt gescreend op een ‘paediatric investigation plan’ (PIP). De resultaten worden opgeslagen in Microsoft Excel en grafisch samengevat in een stroomdiagram. Geneesmiddelen voor diergeneeskundig gebruik, generieke geneesmiddelen, biosimilars en afgewezen geneesmiddelen zullen worden uitgesloten. Nieuwe geneesmiddelen (withdrawn of geautoriseerd) met een vergunning voor het in de handel brengen na 26 juli 2008 zijn geïncludeerd. Vervolgens zal het aantal geneesmiddelen met een PIP worden geëvalueerd en zal elke individuele PIP van de EMA-website met extrapolatie studies worden gedownload. De PIP's zullen worden gecategoriseerd op basis van de aan- of afwezigheid van een extrapolatiestudie. Ten slotte zal voor voltooide PIP's de rol van M&S in de benefit risk discussie worden geëvalueerd door te zoeken naar verklaringen op basis van de extrapolatiestudies in de benefit risk discussie van de overeenkomstige EPAR's. Alle verzamelde gegevens zullen worden gekwantificeerd en geanalyseerd met behulp van eenvoudige lineaire regressie.
Resultaten In totaal werden 1881 geneesmiddelen van de EMA-website gehaald. Geneesmiddelen voor diergeneeskundig (n=280), generiek (n=265), biosimilar (n=82) en afgewezen geneesmiddelen(n=52) werden geëxcludeerd, evenals geneesmiddelen met een handelsvergunning van vóór 26 juli 2008 (n= 474). In totaal kwamen dus 728 geneesmiddelen in aanmerking voor inclusie in dit onderzoek. Voor 175 van deze geneesmiddelen ontbrak een PIP als gevolg van een verkregen ‘waiver’ (n=70), hybride aanvraag (n=21), niet aanbevolen gebruik/geen relevant gebruik (n=28), reeds ingediend in de oorspronkelijke aanvraag voor het in de handel brengen (n=21), reeds geregistreerd werkzaam bestanddeel/aanvraag voor geïnformeerde toestemming (n=30). Deze geneesmiddelen werden daarom niet verder onderzocht. Van de geneesmiddelen met een PIP (n=553) konden in totaal 709 PIP's op de EMA-website worden geïdentificeerd. Wij vonden een jaarlijkse toename van 4% (95% betrouwbaarheidsinterval: 1,7 - 6,0%, p= 0,002) in het aantal extrapolatiestudies per PIP. Van de 709 PIP's werd in 180 (25%) PIP's om een extrapolatiestudie gevraagd, waarvan 37 PIP's met extrapolatiestudie voor 31-05-2022 waren afgerond. Als gevolg van het feit dat één geneesmiddel twee verschillende beoordelingsrapporten had, zijn 38 rapporten beoordeeld. Na beoordeling van de benefit risk discussie van deze PIP's hadden 16 (59%) beoordelingsrapporten een positief advies mede op basis van de extrapolatiestudies, 10 (37%) beoordelingsrapporten hadden geen discussie besproken van extrapolatiestudies in de benefit risk discussie.
Discussie In deze studie werd ervan uitgegaan dat extrapolatiestudies een grote rol spelen in de ‘regulatoire decision’ making voor geneesmiddelen die bestemd zijn voor gebruik bij pediatrische patiënten. Wij stelden echter vast dat slechts in 180 van de 709 PIP's een extrapolatiestudie had uitgevoerd."

differs from Rebecca (1940). This is done by analysing the textual form of both films using the 
neofomalist approach. This thesis first establishes how Rebecca (2020) can be seen as a remake of 
Rebecca (1940), thereby validating a comparison. In addition the thesis will provide an overview of 
literature already written on the female characters in Rebecca (1940), including the work of Tania 
Modleski and Mary Ann Doane. Furthermore a working definition of the concept of “agency” will be 
given. This thesis aimed to answer its research question by using three sub-questions. Those subquestions aimed to find the difference in agency and relationships regarding the female characters. In 
addition a shot-by-shot analysis provided insight in how the camerawork and mise-èn-scene differ in 
both films and how this contributes to the representation of the female characters.
The analysis in this thesis has shown that there is a notable difference in the representation of 
the female characters. This is due to an increase of agency for both the protagonist and the character of 
Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca (2020). Furthermore are the relationships in both films mostly similar, 
however the feelings are expressed more intensely in Rebecca (2020), which results in slight differences. 
These are also caused by the characters getting more agency. The camerawork was found to add more 
suspense and uneasiness to the scenes in Rebecca (2020), which again leads to the sense of bigger 
feelings. The addition of two scenes in Rebecca (2020) also adds to the protagonist feeling more envy 
and anxiety for Rebecca. The main contributor to the changes in Rebecca (2020) is the intensification 
of the feelings of all the characters. The female characters in Rebecca (2020) are more assertive than in 
Rebecca (1940), and they owe this to their more intense feelings."
Hospital registration of adverse drug reactions in electronic health records: importance and contribution to pharmacovigilance,"['Alloush, Roba']","['Egberts, A.C.G.']",2023-06-30T23:01:08Z,EN,[],Farmacie,"Background: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) cause a considerable amount of  mortality and morbidity. However, they are vastly underreported. Information on registered ADRs in hospitals may provide a large real world data source that can be used to ensure patients’ safety.
Purpose: To quantify the contribution of hospital registration of ADRs in electronic health records (EHR) to pharmacovigilance purposes.
Design: An observational retrospective study using data from the Jeroen Bosch Hospital in the Netherlands in 2019.
Methods: Serious and previously unknown ADRs registered systematically in the corresponding fields of EHRs were assessed. 
Results: During the study period, data on 1010 patients were included. Patients aged on average 63 (±17.6) years and the majority was female (66.2%). In total, 1630 ADRs were registered. The most frequent ADRs were ‘nausea’ and ‘vomiting’ and the most involved therapeutic drug groups were opioids and NSAID’s. Fifty eight serious ADRs (5.2%) were registered. Tubulointerstitial nephritis was the most frequently registered serious ADR and was mainly associated with antibacterials for systemic use. A total of 264 previously unknown ADRs (16.2%) were registered of which ‘malaise’ was the most frequent unknown ADR and tramadol was the most involved drug. Additionally, 25 ADRs (1.5%) were registered that may be attributable to 10 drugs that are under additional monitoring.
Conclusion: Hospital registration of ADRs in EHRs provides information on serious and unknown ADRs which are normally challenging to assess during clinical trials. Widespread use of ADR registration can have tremendous value for pharmacovigilance. However, several improvements are needed to optimize this registration."

Studies have shown that in delirium, there is an increase in delta and theta activity, which are the slowest frequencies in the EEG spectrum, but a decrease in activity in the alpha frequency band, which is associated with wakefulness and attention. Additionally, there is a decrease in functional connectivity and efficiency of the brain network in the alpha frequency band, indicating a disruption in the communication between different brain regions. These result suggest a potential for neuromodulatory interventions such as transcranial electrical stimulation as treatment for delirium. Despite the promising results of qEEG analysis in delirium diagnosis, there are still some limitations that need to be addressed. For example, the variability in EEG patterns among patients with delirium and the lack of standardized EEG protocols for delirium diagnosis can make it challenging to identify specific neurophysiological changes that are unique to delirium.  In conclusion, delirium is characterized by diffuse slowing of the EEG, reduced functional connectivity, and decreased efficiency of the brain network. These findings suggest that improved functional connectivity could be a new approach to treat delirium. Future research should aim to address the limitations of EEG research in delirium diagnosis and to further explore the potential of qEEG analysis as a tool for delirium diagnosis and treatment."
Whole body physiological based pharmacokinetic model to explain the drug-drug interaction between voriconazole and flucloxacillin,"['Nieuwendijk, Julia van den']","['Egberts, A.C.G.']",2023-06-30T23:01:10Z,EN,['Voriconazole; flucloxacillin; drug-drug interaction; albumin; WBPBPK'],Farmacie,"Introduction: An intensive care unit (ICU) admitted patient with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and pulmonary aspergillosis received both flucloxacillin and voriconazole as treatments. After conducting voriconazole therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), subtherapeutic voriconazole concentrations were observed. After which treatment was switched to posaconazole. The drug-drug interaction was previous described in literature. The lack of knowledge about the mechanism raised the need to explain the drug-drug interaction (DDI) between voriconazole and flucloxacillin mechanistically. Method: A whole-body pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (WBPBPK) model was applied to predict the DDI. Non-linear liver metabolism was taken into account, as well as non-linear and reversible albumin binding. Protein binding and albumin concentrations as well as elevated CRP levels and decreased CYP-enzymes were used as a surrogate to predict the DDI and simulate an ICU admitted patient. Simulations on four populations with the following characteristics were conducted: healthy (concentration albumin: 40 g/L, normal CRP), ICU-non infected (concentration albumin: 30 g/L, normal CRP), ICU-infected (concentration albumin: 30 g/L, elevated CRP)and DDI (concentration albumin: 2.5 g/L, normal CRP). Results: The model was able to predict the plasma concentration of both voriconazole and posaconazole over time. A lower albumin concentration resulted in higher voriconazole liver and lung tissue uptake, whereas plasma concentrations decreased. Elevated CRP resulted in a decreased metabolism and increased plasma and tissue concentrations of voriconazole. Posaconazole was not affected by the albumin changes. Discussion/conclusion: In conclusion, this model describes the effect of the DDI and influence of CRP on voriconazole plasma concentrations. Although, future research is needed to describe the competition between voriconazole and flucloxacillin for the albumin binding pockets and to understand the influence of CYP-enzyme induction and polymorphism."
NMR studies of an enzyme-RNA complex that confers antimicrobial resistance,"['Waard, Jochem de']","['Weingarth, M.H.']",2023-07-01T01:01:13Z,EN,"['NMR, antimicrobial resistance, enzyme-RNA complex']",Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Resistance to antimicrobials is emerging at an ever-increasing pace. To ensure that our current 
spectrum of clinically used antimicrobials remain active, the development of inhibitors that block 
resistance mechanisms is a crucial strategy in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Macrolides, 
lincosamides and streptogramins antibiotics are a class of antimicrobials that are effective against a 
plethora of bacteria. Bacteria gain resistance by modifying a specific nucleotide in the ribosomal-RNA
(rRNA) of their ribosome, the binding site of these antibiotics. The enzymes responsible for this 
modification are erythromycin resistance methyltransferases (Erm) proteins. To prevent or overcome
resistance development, a strategy is to develop inhibitors that prevent the interaction between Erm 
and rRNA. The effective development of such inhibitors requires a structural understanding of the ErmrRNA interaction. Previous research created a minimal RNA substrate for Erm enzymes, however, when 
combining Erm and the 32 nucleotide RNA that resembles the natural fold of the rRNA the complex 
precipitates. The precipitate limits the structural investigation by conventional methods.
Here we study the non-crystalline precipitate that forms between ErmB and 32-mer RNA at atomic 
level using a combination of solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Solution NMR 
enabled us to assign the backbone of the protein and transfer these to the ssNMR complex spectra. 
Using ssNMR, we show that the ErmB protein is highly ordered in the precipitate, while the RNA is 
heterogeneous and dynamic. However, the lack of clear signal changes between apo-ErmB and 
complex spectra; the similar dynamics of the protein in both states, and the peculiar behaviour of the 
RNA in the complex appear to question if the RNA binds specifically to ErmB in the precipitate. These 
observations raised the question whether the formed precipitate is actually representative of the 
actual binding interaction between Erm and RNA."
A 3/4-approximation of the maximum weight matching problem using the GraphBLAS standard,"['Best, David de']","['Bisseling, Rob']",2023-07-01T01:01:22Z,EN,['GraphBLAS; Maximum weight matching; Graph algorithm; Parallel computing; Approximation algorithm; k-augmentations; linear-time'],Mathematical Sciences,"The maximum weight matching problem is a well-studied and central problem in graph theory, for which a variety of exact and approximation algorithms exist. Parallelisation of these algorithms is often hard, as it is for many graph problems. By designing an algorithm using the GraphBLAS standard, we gain easy access to parallelism in executing the sparse matrix operations that constitute the solution procedure.
We propose an approximation algorithm based on searching and applying a set of positive-gain k-augmentations. In this method, searching for sets of 1-, 2- and 3-augmentations can be performed in linear time in terms of the size of the input graph. By performing a series of these searches and applying the positive-gain augmentations until none are available, we can guarantee a 3/4- approximation of the true maximum weight matching.
We present several numerical results of experiments investigating the runtime of the algorithm and quality of the obtained results."
PHYSIOLOGICALY BASED PHARMACOKINTEIC MODELLING OF 18F-DCFPYL TO PREDICT THE TISSUE DISTRIBUTION IN PATIENTS WITH PROSTATE CANCER,"['Yilmaz, Habibe']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-07-01T00:00:43Z,EN,['PBPK-model; PSMA; Prostaatkanker; 18F-DCFPyL; Theranostics'],Farmacie,"Introduction: The goal of this study was to develop a whole body physiological based pharmacokinetic-model (PBPK-model) to predict the tissue distribution of 18F-DCFPyL in patients with prostate cancer (PCa).

Method: The model was extended from a previously published PBPK-model describing PCa patients to predict the tissue distribution of 18F-DCFPyL. This model describes the tumors and organs at risks. The model was simulated and the results were compared to literature observations of patients with metastatic PCa.

Results: Our model adequately predicted the distribution of 18F-DCFPyL. Sensitivity analysis showed that the receptor densities, tumor flow and haematocrit had significant influence on the model outcome. The release and degradation of 18F-DCFPyL, and total organ volumes showed no significant influence on the outcome.

Discussion: The tumor flow, receptor densities and haematocrit should be measured in the future to accurately predict tissue distribution. The release and degradation of 18F-DCFPyL, and total organ volumes can be fixed on literature data.

Conclusion: The final PBPK-model was able to adequately predict tissue distribution of 18F-DCFPyL."
Providing feedback on cycling metrics in an adaptive training app,"['Tussenbroek, Remy van']","['Masthoff, J.F.M.']",2023-07-07T00:01:04Z,EN,['cycling; feedback; metrics; adaptive training; mobile application'],Human-Computer Interaction,"Cycling technology has developed rapidly. With the advances of Artificial Intelligence and
Machine learning, adaptive training applications have appeared. These provide personalised
training plans that adapt to users’ characteristics such as weekly availability, goal and level. To
be able to provide a sports coach-like experience to the user, developers want to imitate the
process of sports coaching. One of the tasks of a coach is to provide feedback. Some adaptive
training apps try to involve feedback in the form of data analysis and visualisation. However,
actual scientific basis for the (design) decisions taken by these commercial applications is missing.
In collaboration with the mobile adaptive training app JOIN, this thesis developed a way
of providing post-hoc feedback on cycling metrics in a mobile application. We conducted focus
groups to find out what kind of post-hoc feedback users of different levels of expertise want on
training performed. Both experienced and less experienced users agreed on wanting feedback
regarding the quality of specific intervals. Also, an accuracy score seemed to be the most logical
way to show how well the planned training was performed. Lastly, they would like to receive
more information regarding the way the training plan is adjusted after a performed workout.
Using the focus group insights, we iteratively developed low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes.
An implementation, the Workout Score, was chosen to be evaluated with a survey to assess how
much users appreciate the post-hoc feedback on training performed. The survey showed that
participants appreciated the Workout Score, finding it a simple and clear way to show the
planned versus actual training. Yet, the explanation lacked specificity to better show where
users need to improve to increase their score. Furthermore, the inclusion of RPE in the Score
was unclear to some. Additionally, the Workout Score can motivate to stick to the suggested
workout but may also demotivate when users receive a low score without actionable feedback.
To improve the post-hoc feedback feature in the future, separate scores for each component of
the Workout Score should be shown. To add to that, we suggest to reconsider the role of RPE
or to provide a more comprehensive explanation for its inclusion. Lastly, we propose to make it
more evident to users when they should select that they have completed the suggested workout
and when it would instead be better to select that they have done something else. In the future,
JOIN could explore if the algorithm could potentially take over this decision-making process."
Characterization of Enterovirus A71 entry factors in cell lines and Human Enteroids using CRISPR-Cas9 Knock-Out,"['Gasull Celades, Laia']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-07-07T00:01:25Z,EN,['Human intestinal organoids; CRISPR-Cas9; EV-A71; SCARB2; HSPG2; Viral entry; picornavirus; Knock-out; infection'],Infection and Immunity,"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), one of the main causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), is a highly neurotoxic enterovirus belonging to the Picornaviridae family.

Despite its pathogenic potential, the entry pathway by which EV-A71 enters the host cell is still not fully understood. In this study, we characterized the role of two EV-A71 entry factors, SCARB2 and HSPG2, in cell lines and human intestinal organoids using CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out (KO) technology. Here, we show SCARB2 does not act as an entry receptor for EV-A71 as previously reported, since it is not involved in either binding nor internalization of viral particles. However, SCARB2 does play an essential role in later stages of EV-A71 infection, following internalization. Furthermore, HSPG2 is neither an entry receptor nor involved in EV-A71 infection in cell lines and human intestinal organoids. Our findings disprove the role of SCARB2 as an entry receptor and show HSPG2 as a non-essential factor for EV-A71 infection. This research further stresses the need to fully characterize the entry pathway of EV-A71, as the current understanding of viral pathogenesis is incomplete."

We developed and compared various models, including a feature-based linear regression model, a similarity-based support vector machine (SVM), and a Long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Among these models, the LSTM demonstrated the best performance. Additionally, we conducted an expert analysis involving a Dutch test expert to assess the proximity of the model and human scorers to the scores that would be assigned by correctly using the answer key. The results showed similar performance between the model and human scorers, suggesting that automatic scoring models offer a promising approach for mitigating bias.

The role of the cerebellum in facial expression processing and mentalizing in autism: a systematic literature review,"['Vries, Ineke de']","['Klaus, Jana']",2023-07-07T00:01:26Z,EN,"['cerebellum, social cognition, theory of mind, mentalizing, facial expression processing, ASD, functional connectivity, functional neuroimaging, structural neuroimaging']",Neuroscience and Cognition,"Deficits in social cognition, including facial expression processing and theory of mind, is one of the main symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is also a predictor for several functional problems. In the past, the cerebellum was only known for its role in controlling and coordinating complex movements. Recently, the cerebellum has been associated with its contribution to emotional processing and mentalizing. Research indicated that the cerebellum has functional and structural impairments in individuals with ASD. 
The purpose of the current systematic literature review was to examine the role of the cerebellum in facial expression processing and theory of mind in ASD by reviewing published functional and structural brain imaging studies. 
We used PubMed and Web of Science to find all functional- and structural neuroimaging studies reporting on cerebellar activity in individuals with ASD regarding facial expression processing and/or theory of mind, published up to April 2023. In total, 18 functional and structural neuroimaging studies were selected for reviewing. 
Results	Most facial expression processing studies reported reduced left and/or right posterior cerebellar activity in ASD compared to typical developing controls. In line with this, most functional connectivity (FC) studies indicated decreased FC in ASD between the (left) cerebellum and certain temporal, and parietal brain areas involved in mentalizing in the right hemisphere. The reviewed theory of mind studies reported conflicting and mixed results. 
Our findings suggest that reduced cerebellar activity in facial expression processing might contribute to the reduced ability to recognize facial expressions in other individuals. The results also suggest that reduced FC of the cerebellum with brain areas involved in mentalizing might contribute to mentalizing deficits in ASD. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to small samples, different age groups, medication use and comorbidities in the included studies. In future studies, it might be interesting to focus on FC in ASD relative to healthy controls during emotion processing and theory of mind tasks. It might also be interesting to establish the role of distinct cerebellar regions in emotion- and mentalizing processes in ASD."
ESG: Green Intentions or Green Illusions - Influence of ESG Ratings on Firms’ Innovative Performance in the European Union,"['Keijzer, Jolan']","['Wanzenböck, Iris']",2023-07-07T00:01:22Z,EN,[],Innovation Sciences,"Environmental Social Governance (ESG) has become increasingly important to incorporate non-financial information in investment decisions. ESG disclosure requirements are gaining momentum in Europe, reinforced by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). These policies are introduced to promote sustainable development, while simultaneously creating shareholder value. However, most European ESG research solely focuses on the financial performance of firms. This finance literature shows that ESG leads to increased access to capital at lower cost, which results in increased R&D spending. However, the literature fails to examine potential non-financial benefits of ESG. This leads to a lack of understanding of why firms engage in ESG and what benefits this results in. Legitimacy and signalling theory provide opposing explanations for why firms engage in ESG. Legitimacy theory posits that poorly-performing firms with regards to ESG engage with ESG in order to legitimise other practices that misalign with societal values. Whereas, signalling theory posits that well-performing firms use disclosure to highlight their superior ESG performance. Neither of these theories provide conclusive evidence on non-financial benefits of ESG. This paper zooms in on non-financial benefits of ESG through green innovative performance, a component of sustainable performance, and distinguishes between green and non-green innovation in order to examine the incongruence of legitimacy and signalling theory. Concretely, this thesis asks: ”How do changes in firms’ ESG rating affect the green and non-green innovative performance of firms in the European Union and how do these effects relate to each-other”?

To answer this, negative binomial regression analysis and the Seemingly Enrelated Estimation method are applied to patent and ESG rating data, which measure firms’ innovative and ESG performance. The sample consists of large European firms in the period from 2014-2017 and a distinction is made in green and non-green innovation through CPC class Y02. As expected, ESG positively influences both green and non-green innovation, which highlights the presence of the effects of both legitimacy and signalling theory. For green innovation this effect is especially evident for smaller firms. Surprisingly, it is shown that the effect of ESG is stronger on non-green innovation than on green innovation. These findings provide implications for the CSRD. First, CSRD extends the reporting requirement to smaller firms, which show a larger increase in green innovation. Second, larger firms seem to increase their ESG without improving their underlying performance. The audit requirement of the CSRD might reduce this discrepancy between the ESG rating and underlying performance."

As a response, the EU-funded GRASP research consortium nominated
high concentration hydrogen peroxide (HP) as a suitable non-toxic replacement. However, to date still
several issues impede the implementation of HP as a space propellant, which have been addressed in this research. First of all, high concentration HP is either poorly available or only at high cost. SolvGE has invented
a safe and user-friendly method to carry out purification of easily available low concentration to propellantgrade HP. Even though this purification process already has an acceptable efficiency, the waste stream
still contains HP. Since the efficiency of the concentration process itself is limited by Raoult’s law, it is only
possible to increase the overall process efficiency by recuperation of HP from the effluent flow. The company
desired that the proposed solution would not affect the current process, and would add minimal complexity
to the system. In addition, the solution should not affect neither the passive nature of the system nor the
system’s autonomy. It was found that subsequent cooling and condensation of the waste stream would be
the optimum approach to achieve this goal. In order to gain fundamental understanding of this process, a
theoretical model was set up that would predict the required condenser properties. Then, experiments were
conducted that supplied evidence to validate both the key assumptions in the model and the model itself.
Though, it was found that the model would considerably underestimate the required condenser size, which
can be attributed to both the relatively low concentration of HP in the waste stream and the relatively low
turbulence in the flow, as well as the large uncertainty in the actual flow rate. Ultimately, the research efforts
did not culminate into a detailed design solution, yet they did provide SolvGE with further understanding of
the problem and a starting point for further development.
Secondly, at this time no catalyst is available that can ignite HP - ethanol mixtures and withstand the
environment (up to 2000°C and over 20 bar) in a rocket engine for prolonged periods of time. Current research
efforts have focused on the synthesis of a HP decomposition catalyst: the hence liberated heat then serves to
ignite ethanol. Generally, when manganese oxide (MnOx) catalysts would be operated under these conditions
the active phase will rapidly deactivate. Yet, Serra Maia’s group has shown that properly supported MnOx
catalysts can be operated in decomposition for twenty-five minutes without noticeable degradation.
Though, these catalysts most likely cannot withstand the operation conditions of a HP - ethanol engine.
This research utilized drop-testing to investigate reactivity and deactivation behavior of MnOx catalysts
on different supports. Drop-testing is a common method to investigate hypergolicity, as opposed to engine
testing. It can also be employed to study decomposition behavior, for instance of HP. Even though the resemblance to decomposition chamber conditions is poor, this method allows for a fast screening of catalysts. In
addition, it mimics repeated engine starts, and can thus simulate long-term deactivation behavior. In droptesting a drop of HP is released from a set height onto the catalyst, and the subsequent reaction is monitored.
Here the reactions were monitored using high speed imaging and a fast thermal data recorder. Ceramic catalysts pellets (cercaps) were prepared by mixing 1.5 wt.% MnO2 with different metal oxides and subsequently
firing at high temperature. Of the tested support materials (i.a. silica, titania, kaolin and magnesium spinel),
only yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and γ-alumina (yAl) showed measurable acti"

Upon the combination of two qualitative methodologies, the related themes of the research object were identified and connected to the current literature concerning interpersonal intercultural interactions as well as their impacts on identity negotiation and attitudes transformation. The results from the research data confirmed several existing theories of how foreign engagement positively influences interlocutors’ attitudes toward others with different backgrounds. Despite the limitations of the research, international participants were observed to undergo reflections on their previous images of ‘self’ and ‘others’, and modify their stereotypical perceptions of individuals of a specific group.

However, there is still a “justice gap” regarding sexual offences: most cases are not reported or prosecuted. Sexual violence can lead to secondary victimisation: victims suffer consequences from the crime itself, but also its aftermath. Stemming from the restorative justice movement, restorative mediation can be a solution. Restorative mediation, a voluntary dialogue facilitated by a neutral mediator, can be direct or indirect. Literature suggests direct mediations provide more ground for emotional healing due to a multitude of vocal and non-vocal cues. The mediator and the presence of a (sincere) apology were also expected to influence the mediation’s perceived success. A mixed-methods study, with a focus on a qualitative, thematic analysis of 120 logbooks of mediations in sexual offences, was performed with the aim to investigate the difference in perceived success between the mediation types. Direct mediations are more prevalent within sexual offences compared to other violent crimes. The results confirm that direct mediations have more positive results than indirect mediations. However, within indirect mediations, letter exchanges are evaluated more positively than shuttle mediations. The results also confirm the importance of the mediator, a (sincere) apology, and, additionally, the attitude of the participants. Shuttle mediations appeared susceptible to disappointment and misinterpretation, but direct mediations (and letter exchanges in part) can help cope with trauma. Limitations of this study were dependence on secondary data and selection bias. Recommendations are given to mediators regarding their work process, and to Perspectief Herstelbemiddeling regarding their policy development and research."

Deze groeperingen ervaren mogelijk barrières waardoor zij niet kunnen deelnemen aan het Nederlands mobiliteitssysteem. Het mobiliteitssysteem wordt vormgegeven aan de hand van beleid van het ministerie van Infrastructuur en Waterstaat. Een beleidsanalyse is uitgevoerd over alle grote nota’s omtrent mobiliteit en ruimtelijke ordening van de afgelopen vijftig jaar. Hiermee wordt vastgesteld hoeveel aandacht er geweest is over de afgelopen vijftig jaar voor verschillende groeperingen, wat de gelijke toegang tot mobiliteit bevordert. Binnen deze beleidsanalyse waren de voornaamste resultaten dat er weinig aandacht was voor verschillende groeperingen, met name gender. Om de achterliggende overwegingen beter te begrijpen zijn er ook vijftien expertinterviews gehouden. De belangrijkste conclusies waren dat in de afgelopen vijftig jaar een focus op financiële groei en het mobiliteitssysteem leidden tot dat er geen of weinig rekening is gehouden met de mensen die minder of geen gebruik kunnen maken van het mobiliteitssysteem. Hier speelt de positie van beleidsmakers ook een rol. Als beleidsaanbeveling wordt dan ook gepleit voor het verplicht stellen van een sociale beleidstoets. De integratie van sociale wetenschappen binnen het ministerie van Infrastructuur en Waterstaat kan hier een waardevolle stap in betekenen.  Ook moet een intensievere samenwerking met andere ministeries en decentrale overheden bevorderd worden.

Dit gebrek aan aandacht voor de cultuur resulteert in een afname van de motivatie om de klassieke talen te leren, wat op zijn beurt leidt tot een afname van het aantal leerlingen op het gymnasium.
Het doel van dit ontwerponderzoek is om de inzet van geschiedenisdidactiek te onderzoeken als ondersteuning van de cultuurdidactiek bij de klassieke talen, met als specifieke doelstelling het bevorderen van het begrip receptie en als gevolg het vergroten van de motivatie onder leerlingen. Om deze doelstelling te bereiken, is de volgende hoofdvraag geformuleerd: Wat zijn de kenmerken van een geschikt ontwerp om het begrip receptie te behandelen, waarmee als gevolg de intrinsieke motivatie voor de klassieke talen kan worden vergroot, voor de leerlingen van G5a van het Oosterlicht College in Nieuwegein?
Om de hoofdvraag te beantwoorden, zijn er twee onderzoekscycli uitgevoerd waarin werd geanalyseerd in hoeverre het ontwerp bijdroeg aan het bevorderen van receptie en of dit op een motiverende wijze plaatsvond. In de eerste onderzoekscyclus stond een focusgroep centraal, terwijl in de tweede cyclus de leerlingen zelf werden betrokken. De bevindingen laten zien dat een mysteriewerkvorm een geschikte benadering is om het begrip receptie op een motiverende wijze aan te leren. De mysteriewerkvorm biedt leerlingen de mogelijkheid om historisch te redeneren, wat van essentieel belang is bij de behandeling van receptie. Bovendien hebben de leerlingen motivatie ervaren door het gebruik van de mysteriewerkvorm.
Op basis van deze bevindingen wordt aanbevolen om activerende geschiedenisdidactiek in te zetten bij de behandeling van cultuur bij de klassieke talen, enerzijds vanwege de overlappende elementen tussen beide vakgebieden en anderzijds vanwege de motiverende effecten die dit kan hebben voor de klassieke talen."

Our main contributions are three new structure preserving prolongation operators that can transfer signals between the fine and the coarse multigrid levels for directional fields in discrete exterior algebra, face-based fields, and power fields. The prolongation operators can be defined as an interpolation from the fine to the coarse version of a collapsed 1-ring. We tested each of these operators with three different multigrid solvers on a most harmonic field problem for twelve different meshes with sizes ranging from 13K to 270K faces. Although the precomputation time for our operators is long, our prolongation operators in combination with our multigrid solvers are poised to outperform linear least squares by a significant
margin when solving for larger meshes."

Tot nu toe weinig gebruikt in de Nederlandse letterkunde, wordt petrocultuur in Rubiks kubus gehanteerd om een corpus Nederlandse en Roemeense teksten uit het interbellum in vergelijking met elkaar te onderzoeken. Een prominente discrepantie tussen het Nederlandse en het Roemeense perspectief komt dusdanig naar voren: alhoewel het Nederlandse discours vaak kritisch is voor verschillende emanaties van de geoliede moderniteit, vertoont het blinde vlekken met betrekking tot de échte tol van de olie-exploitatie – die in het Roemeense discours juist in de verf gezet worden. Dit onderzoek laat dusdanig zien dat petrocultuur een mondiaal fenomeen is die lokale invullingen krijgt afhankelijk van de status en de rol van een gebied in de internationale oliedynamiek. Ik betoog daarom dat petrocultuur als cultureel fenomeen zich bij uitstek in vergelijkend en transnationaal perspectief goed laat bestuderen. Bovendien is deze vergelijkende analyse voor zowel Nederland als Roemenië maatschappelijk relevant. Hij confronteert enerzijds Nederland met de schaduwzijde van de internationale olie-exploitatie gedurende het interbellum waar het land – door Shell – bij betrokken was en houdt anderzijds Roemenië een spiegel voor. Het zelfbeeld dat dit land koestert over het interbellum wordt door de uitkomsten van dit onderzoek genuanceerd."
"Who volunteers? A study on the determinants of volunteering for refugee focused civil organizations, and 
gender differences within these determinants","['Poppel, Thomas van']","['Bos, Lute']",2023-07-22T00:01:07Z,EN,['integration; refugees; volunteering; human capital; social capital; cultural capital'],Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems,"Introduction: More refugees are crossing Dutch borders, with civil society accommodating their 
integration process. Volunteers are of increased importance in our contemporary society. Literature 
suggests people’s obtained resources determine their voluntary participation, but insights on 
volunteering for refugee focused organizations still lack. Objective: Researchers have investigated 
determinants in doing voluntary work, and now it is important to better understand which aspects 
determine the likelihood to volunteer for refugee focused organizations. This study investigates ‘who’ 
these volunteers are. Theory: Human capital, social capital and cultural capital were used to understand 
the effects of education, social contact frequency and religiosity on the likelihood to volunteer. 
Additionally, socialization and social learning theory were applied to understand gender differences in 
the effect on volunteering. Method: Data from the LISS panel 2022 were used to answer the 
propositions, executing a binary logistic regression to understand the effect of education, social contact 
frequency and religiosity on the likelihood to volunteer. Results: Volunteering behavior was affected 
by educational level and religiosity, making human and cultural capital important mechanisms. Social 
contact frequency does not affect volunteering. Neither education, social contact or religiosity showed 
gender difference. Conclusion and implications: Higher education associates with higher odds in 
volunteering, through the contribution of cognitive competence, social status and social awareness. 
Religiosity influences volunteering due to altruistic and caring values religious people comply with. In 
attracting fitting volunteers, awareness should be created in higher educational, and more religious 
contexts. To reach the lower educated, the acquisition and awareness should be targeted to intermediate 
vocational education level. Academie van de Stad could carry this out, but municipalities have a role in 
facilitating a framework for the acquisition of volunteers at lower educational levels."
How users interact with dark patterns: researching effects on time spent and gaze patterns with eye tracking,"['Schaareman, David']","['Nimwegen, Christof van']",2023-07-22T00:01:05Z,EN,"['deceptive design, dark patterns, eye tracking, gaze patterns']",Human-Computer Interaction,"Dark patterns (also known as deceptive design) are techniques that can be applied in digital user interfaces to steer the behaviour of the user into a certain direction that is beneficial for the owner of the website or app. A lot of research has been done over the last few years on this topic, but not much is yet known about how users look at instances of dark patterns nor how much time they cost or save users. Hence this research investigates user gazing behaviour using eye tracking equipment and simultaneously measures the time users spend looking at dark patterns and how this influences their total time spent on a task. The research consists of an experiment (N=13) in which people completed two tasks in a randomised order. Both tasks had an experimental version with dark patterns and a control version without dark patterns. Each participant saw one task in the control version and one task in the experimental version. Divided over the two tasks seven instances of dark patterns were implemented: sneak into basket, trick question, false hierarchy, preselection, nagging, low-stock/high-demand messages, and confirmshaming. All participants also completed a demographics questionnaire and took part in a retrospective think-aloud session. The results of the experiment showed that participants spent significantly more time on the checkout page in the experimental version of the first task, in which sneak into basket, trick question and false hierarchy were applied, compared to the control condition without dark patterns. For all of these three patterns it was also found – using Area of Interest analysis – that the participants spent more time looking at the deceptive version of the element, compared to the control version. For the other four patterns no such results were found. For the preselection pattern the opposite was found: participants spent on average less time looking at the options when one was already selected. This is probably caused by the fact that they were not required to perform an action in this area if they were satisfied with the selected option. In addition to time based metrics also the gaze patterns (the way the gaze of the participants moved over the screen) were analysed. For some types of dark patterns typical gaze patterns could be distinguished. For the trick question for example regressions (gaze jumping back to a previous word while reading) were seen often. This research contributes to the further understanding of how dark patterns are perceived by users. It can help designers to weigh the effects they want to achieve with the application of dark patterns against the adverse effects, such as extra time that is needed for the users. On a more theoretical side it offers extra insight in how users interact with and look at dark patterns on websites. This can also help in determining the severity of types of dark patterns, which in turn can help deciding what legislation is needed. Future research can consist of researching more types of patterns with a larger and a more diverse sample in order to be able to draw stronger conclusions."

Zowel de vroedschap van Amsterdam als het Lagerhuis hadden bezwaren tegen het staand leger van Willem III en vreesden dat het de politieke balans en vrijheden zou bedreigen. De vroedschap van Amsterdam wilde zo veel mogelijk een open conflict met Frankrijk vermijden, aangezien de Hollandse Oorlog pas een aantal jaar voorbij was en de Republiek economisch nog niet was hersteld. Het Engelse Lagerhuis was bezorgd over de groeiende macht van de kroon en zag het leger als een instrument dat Willem III kon gebruiken om de invloed van het parlement te ondermijnen. 

Beide staatsorganen hebben zich actief verzet tegen het beleid van Willem III, waarbij de vroedschap van Amsterdam weigerde om het lichten van de troepen te financieren en politieke maatregelen nam om zijn macht in te perken, terwijl het Lagerhuis in de Bill of Rights verzekerde dat een staand leger alleen met toestemming van het Engelse parlement in vredestijd mocht bestaan. Het verzet van de vroedschap van Amsterdam en het Engelse Lagerhuis illustreert de voortdurende strijd over hun machtsverhouding met respectievelijk de stadhouder en de koning, en een vergelijking van de twee staatsorganen biedt de mogelijkheid om inzicht te krijgen in de regeerperiode van Willem III."

This research focuses on the evolution of the agency by applying historical institutionalism and analysing three critical junctures, namely the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, the migrant crisis in 2015 and the increased criticism on the agency from 2020 onwards. By demonstrating how unintended consequences occurred in Frontex’ path dependent development, this research will explain how a constant linkage between migration and security, disagreement among the EU Member States and a lack of prioritising fundamental rights within the agency, eventually led to Frontex being able to divert from EU law. The unintended consequences of attempts to find solutions to crises and fix the problems within the agency, only led to Frontex’ activities turning out to be highly problematic and ending up creating problems it was supposed to solve.

de Franse Revoluties zullen de Hébertistes en Les Égaux bekeken worden. Om een waardevolle
vergelijking te kunnen maken wordt er gebruik gemaakt van path dependency theorie, wat de
vergelijking structuur geeft. De Levellers ontwikkelden na hun ontstaan steeds radicalere ideeën over
gelijkheid in de samenleving en werden steeds harder tegenover de regering. Ook groeide hun
aanhang hard. De Diggers ontwikkelden na de verplaatsing van hun commune ook radicalere ideeën,
door het verzet waar ze doorlopend mee te maken hadden. Ondanks hun geringe aantal, werden ze
uiteindelijk wel als bedreiging gezien vanwege hun radicaliserende ideeën. De Hébertistes hadden
voor hun groeiende invloed na de moord op Marat al radicale ideeën, die daarna eigenlijk nauwelijks
veranderden. Wel radicaliseerde de schaal waarop hun ideeën toegepast konden en moesten worden.
Les Égaux hadden net als de Hébertistes al een duidelijke ideologie voor de sluiting van hun club.
Hierna radicaliseerde de beweging door het plannen van een complot en het toewerken naar een
opstand tegen de regering. Er zijn veel overeenkomsten tussen de radicaliseringsprocessen, maar het
Engelse radicaliseringsproces draait voornamelijk om ideeën en het Franse proces veel meer om
groeiende invloed en het toepassen van deze ideeën. Dit maakt dat de twee radicaliseringsprocessen

‘The slave trade obstructs the civilisation and commerce of the natives’: The evolution of culturalist views in the British Abolitionist Movement 1780-1833,"['Zwaal, Ramya']","['Vartija, Devin']",2023-07-22T00:00:49Z,EN,[],Geschiedenis van Politiek en Maatschappij,"Since the second half of the twentieth century, revisionist historiography on the British abolitionist movement has examined the campaigns against the slave trade and slavery from new perspectives. However, despite featuring so heavily in abolitionist discourse, the role of culturalist views¬¬¬ —views that purported the superiority of British Christian culture— in the movement has been largely overlooked, with only one existing study taking a culturalist lens on British abolitionism. This thesis attempts to fill this gap by examining how and why culturalist views evolved in the British abolitionist movement between 1780 and 1833. By applying discourse analysis and contextualist theory, it analyses how eighteenth- and nineteenth-century ideas around progress, civilisation, and the moral improvement of enslaved Africans were employed in essays, reports, and parliamentary debates to argue for the ending of the slave trade and slavery in the British colonies. The first chapter examines the campaign against the slave trade between 1780 and 1807, focusing on the shift from religious to economic arguments, and the rise of ideas around Britain’s civilising role in Africa post-abolition. The second chapter examines the campaign against slavery between 1807 and 1833. It explores the overlooked role of the African Institution, and its aims of civilising Africa and implementing Slave Trade laws, and the influence of Evangelicals and Wesleyan Methodists as the campaign shifted to emancipation. It also looks at discourse around the potential economic development of Britain’s colonies if they were emancipated. In highlighting the centrality of culturalist views in the abolitionist movement, this thesis continues the revisionist trend of challenging arguments that celebrate the virtue and selflessness of British abolitionists."

"How do employees within a sheltered workplace conceptualize health and health promotion?
A secondary qualitative analysis using an intersectional approach among employees from a sheltered workplace with a SEP and able-bodiedness perspective.","['Vlieks, Kelly']","['Berkel, J. van']",2023-07-27T00:00:58Z,EN,"['Intersectionality, SEP, able-bodiedness, conceptualizations, health, health promotion']",Social Policy and Public Health,"There are persistent socioeconomic health inequalities in the Netherlands, with lower socioeconomic position (SEP) individuals living up to 25 years shorter in good health, compared to higher SEP individuals. Workplace health promotion interventions in the sheltered workplace are considered promising for addressing these health inequalities, particularly for low SEP individuals and those with disabilities. But differences in conceptualizations of health (and health promotion) between intervention developers/policymakers and those who are targeted, together with the lack of acknowledging diversity within the lower SEP group can possibly be the cause of the ineffectiveness of these interventions. 
This study takes an intersectional perspective to consider how SEP and able-bodiedness interact and thereby shape one’s conceptualization of health and health promotion by following the guidelines for secondary intersectional analysis as proposed by Muntinga et al (2020). For this analysis, transcripts of individual interviews and group dialogues with employees of a sheltered workplace were used. 
The findings of this study highlight the influence of capital (e.g. economic resources, knowledge, and social networks), responsibility, and the role of environmental contexts in shaping conceptualizations of health and health promotion among employees at the sheltered workplace. These conceptualizations have been shaped by internalized neoliberal thoughts focusing on self-reliance, accountability, and responsibility. 
By recognizing the complexities following intersections on these conceptualizations, policymakers can develop approaches for worksite health promotion that are more suitable for the specific needs and opportunities of this group regarding health. In the future, interventions aiming to tackle health inequalities should be accompanied by policies that aim to tackle the structural barriers for those working at a sheltered workplace."
Under pressure: Social support and performance pressure in the relationship between substance use and mental health,"['Holtschlag, Juliët']","['Kamphuis, Carlijn']",2023-07-27T00:01:06Z,EN,['Substance use; mental health; social support; performance pressure'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Existing research widely acknowledges the frequently co-occurrence and mutual reinforcement of substance use and problems in mental health. However, there is inconsistency: not every individual using substances experiences mental health concerns, and not every individual struggling with a mental health disorder initiates substance use. A knowledge gap exists regarding what mechanisms cause these differences. Literature presupposes that social support and performance pressure are likely to be of influence within the context of Dutch youth. Therefore, the current study investigated the moderating role of social support and performance pressure in the relationship between substance use (i.e., alcohol, cannabis and hard drugs) and mental health. Data of the young adult health monitor 2021 were used. This monitor was conducted within the municipality of Utrecht (N = 1913) among youth aged 16-25 years. Based on these data, regression analyses were conducted, in which social support and performance pressure were singly included as interaction terms. Results show that levels of social support do not modify the relationship between substance use and mental health. In contrast, the level of performance pressure does matter, but opposite to what was expected: the combination of the use of alcohol or hard drugs and high performance pressure results in better mental health, compared to those that experience high performance pressure and do not use alcohol or hard drugs. Based on additional literature, it seems plausible that using these substances buffers the negative relationship between performance pressure and mental health, at least on the short term. However, future research with a longitudinal approach is needed to confirm and clarify this explanation. The findings of the current study imply that within a population of high educated students, one should be aware that targeting social support and performance pressure, although beneficial for mental health, will not necessarily result in reduced substance use."

Whereby it sought to shed light on the factors that shape social engagement and provide valuable insights for urban planning and community development efforts. By employing four multiple regression models which suggest that high residential mobility affects the degree of social engagement in neighbourhoods in Amsterdam. Whereby the presence of families will significantly impact this mechanism. Family households still play a vital role in community building. The part of family households in neighbourhoods emerged as a significant aspect of the statistical results. Families have long been recognised as building blocks of communities, fostering a sense of community, social cohesion, and connectedness. Whereby this thesis will not disprove these claims. By recognising the complexities of these dynamics, this study could offer additional insight into sociology and social geography.

The Relative Importance of Patient and Physician Characteristics on Physicians’ Likelihood to Provide Self-Management Support to Patients,"['Drummen, Marlou']","['Kamphuis, Carlijn']",2023-07-27T00:01:03Z,EN,['Person-Centered Care; decision-making; patient characteristics; physician characteristics; self-management'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Abstract 
Background 
Person-Centered Care (PCC) strives to treat patients as individuals and as equal partners in decision-making. However, PCC faces the barrier of physicians not supporting their patients’ self-management and remaining to adhere to a paternalistic decision-making approach. Physicians sometimes adhere to a paternalistic decision-making style because they underestimate the extent to which patients can take responsibility for their health. This study aimed to investigate the relative importance of two patient characteristics (a patient’s education level and social support) and one physician characteristic (work experience) on physicians’ likelihood to provide self-management support to patients.  

Methods 
The study consisted of a quantitative research design using secondary data from a factorial survey from 2017, administered by University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU). The study sample consisted of 47 General Practitioners (GPs) and 13 GPs in training. A multinominal logistic regression was used to create a model of the relationship between the predictor variables (education level, social support, and work experience) and physicians’ likelihood of providing self-management support to patients. 

Results 
This study shows that a high education level (vs. low education level) is the only patient characteristic in this study that has a significant effect on physicians’ likelihood of providing self-management support to patients, Neutral (p = .025), and Likely (p = .021). While patients’ social support and physician work experience do not significantly affect this likelihood.  

Conclusion 
This study shows that physicians are more likely to provide self-management support to patients with a high education level vs. low education level. The patient's characteristic of social support and the physician's characteristic of work experience had no significant effect.  

Implications 
Suggested future interventions include training for physicians (in training) to familiarize themselves with PCC and become aware of their implicit bias, and decision-making styles concerning patients’ education level. Furthermore, a PCC moment during a consult could be scheduled which allows the patient the opportunity to inform the physician on their circumstances to ensure adherence to PCC."

However, research shows that HIV stigma is still present and acts as a barrier to HIV care. While South Africa has of the world’s largest anti-retroviral therapy (ART) programs and a high HIV prevalence, HIV stigma still has a significant impact on treatment adherence. Given such insights, this thesis explores how people living with HIV internalize stigma during the various stages from HIV diagnosis to treatment adherence. This thesis focuses on the following question: How do people with HIV (PWH) internalize HIV stigma during different stages from HIV diagnosis to treatment adherence in the context of Johannesburg, South Africa (SA)?
To provide a framework for understanding these experiences, this work adopts a modified version of the HIV stigma framework (Earnshaw et al., 2009). The HIV stigma framework states that it is important to distinguish between different stigma mechanisms because they may have different relationships with health-related outcomes for people living with HIV (PWH; Earnshaw et al., 2009). This study focuses on internalized stigma, and the conceptual model established further guided the deductive thematic content analysis. Pre-existing data was used, and the methodology included 22 semi-structured interviews with PWH in Johannesburg, SA. 
The findings suggest that PWH internalize HIV stigma in the early stages of HIV testing and diagnosis by developing a negative self-image, which manifests itself in negative emotions, feelings of despair, anger, self-blame, suicidal tendencies, and denial of the HIV diagnosis. In the second stage of starting treatment, PWH experience fear of disclosing. In the third stage of living with HIV and adhering to treatment, internalized stigma is manifested through concealment to avoid stigmatization."
The Role The Illicit International Arms Trade Had In Revolutionising Insurgency Groups.,"[""O'Donnell, Andrew""]","['Paravantes, Simeon']",2023-07-27T00:00:54Z,EN,[],International Relations in Historical Perspective,"Revolutionary groups and their use of arms are inexplicably linked. Groups such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA), the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) were financed, supplied and armed through a constantly evolving international arms trafficking network. This thesis does not seek to provide a comprehensive history of the illicit arms trade, but to provide an analysis of the interactions of these revolutionary groups with the global illicit arms trade network. This paper will analyse the inherent geopolitical factors in how revolutionary groups exploited the illicit arms trade to revolutionise their operations to become a direct threat to state governments, and global threats. For the purposes of this analysis, the factors that this piece will look at are how these groups interact with the illicit arms trade but also underlying geopolitical influences.

The major conclusions drawn from this thesis will be that the illicit arms trade during the latter 20th century was emblematic of the global international environment. Nationalist and political struggles, which produced insurgency movements alongside the role of the superpowers, were all key players in the illicit arms trade. Insurgency groups exploited the illicit global arms to revolutionise their operations to challenge national governments and, also, to present a global threat. Furthermore, the illicit arms trade network was shaped by the superpowers at the height of the Cold War, and it could be argued that these domestic conflicts were small parts, or a microcosm of the larger global ideological battle taking place, at least in the eyes of the superpowers."

Findings indicated that high-risk perception was prevalent when the reported death cases were high and there was high trust in the government present among the students but no correlation with the stringency of measures. Furthermore, the results also note that adherence to masking and testing decreased as the reported death cases decreased and the stringency of measures decreased. This can indicate that students adhere more to preventative measures when the situation is serious (leading to death) and the government puts more stringency of measures in place. However, this study found no significant relationship between risk perception, governmental trust, and student adherence to COVID-19 preventative measures."

sustainable behaviour and is this effect moderated by climate change stress? Theory: The Social 
Identity Theory and its relevance to understanding how social cohesion influences sustainable 
behaviour is explored. The importance of ingroup identification and social norms in shaping 
behaviour is emphasized in this theory. The potential influence of climate anxiety on 
sustainable behaviour is discussed with the Uncertainty Identity theory. Method: The Cultural

sustainable behaviour and of the moderating effect of climate stress found. The hypotheses are 
rejected. Conclusion and policy advice: Social cohesion does not have a significant effect on 
sustainable behaviour, possibly due to measuring low-cost behaviours and using a single item 
to measure sustainable behaviour. Climate anxiety is found to be a significant predictor of 
sustainable behaviour, but increasing anxiety is not recommended. The policy advice is
improving mental health care facilities and support from non-governmental organizations. It 
also emphasizes the need for government changes and climate action policies."
Primary Attachment Figures and Depressive Symptoms in Young Adults,"['Joosten, Timo']","['Ouvrein, Gaëlle']",2023-07-26T14:00:39Z,EN,['Depressive symptoms; Depression; father-child relationship; mother-child relationship; parent-child relationship; attachment theory; gender; romantic relationship'],Youth Studies,"Depression is prevalent among young adults in the Netherlands, which impacts both personal lives and the Dutch society. Parent-child relationship quality is known to be an important predictor of developing depression as a young adult, as parents are important attachment figures. Literature points out that the relation with one’s mother is a stronger predictor for depression compared to the relation with one’s father. It is however not clear whether child gender is a moderator for these effects. Also, the moderating effect of romantic relationship quality has not been researched in the context of this research. To clear up these gaps and inconsistencies in the literature, a longitudinal study design was used (N= 1628) Dutch adolescents in two waves of age 12 and 18. Results show that mother-child relationship quality is a significant predictor of depression, whereas father-child relationship quality is not. Also, both gender and romantic relationship quality were not a significant moderator on the effect of mother-child relationship quality. Thus, it is important to consider the relationship with one’s mother when assessing the risk for depression. These results may also imply that the biggest influence of parents on children’s depression is before the age of 12."

Hierbij stonden de ervaringen van deze jongeren centraal om ze een podium te kunnen bieden binnen de wetenschappelijke literatuur. Er is onderzocht wat de impact van dak- en thuisloosheid is op het psychisch welzijn en het toekomstperspectief en welke rol het sociale netwerk heeft gespeeld in de periode van dak- en/of thuisloosheid. Methode: De kwalitatieve semigestructureerde interviews zijn afgenomen bij zeven jongeren (18-26 jaar) die terugblikken op hun periode van dak- en/of thuisloosheid.

The impact of homelessness on their psychological well-being, future perspectives, and the role of the social network during the period of homelessness were investigated. Method: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were used to interview seven young people (18-26 years old) who look back on their time being homeless. Results: The results indicate that becoming homeless has several consequences for these youth, however, this can vary from person to person. In particular, these youngsters felt that they were completely on their own during this period. This period was characterized by most youth by feelings of anxiety, insecurity and surviving day by day. This also caused a negative change in these youths' view of the future. Discussion: Further research is important to examine the possible solutions in counseling and informing to be able to prevent homelessness for the youth under 18 with youth assistance. In doing so, it is important to include the experiential knowledge of young people."
Exploring the Potential of Thermal Point Clouds to Assess Crop Water Stress Within Precision Viticulture,"['Buunk, Thomas']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-07-28T01:01:54Z,EN,"['Crop Water Stress Index, 3D Thermal Point Clouds, UAV Remote Sensing, Thermal Imaging, Precision Viticulture']",Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"The Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) has emerged as a valuable tool in Precision Viticulture
(PV) for assessing crop water stress over vast areas. This is particularly significant considering 
the increasing demand for water and limited water resources. Maximizing water efficiency and 
crop yield through irrigation scheduling is therefore of utmost importance. While various 
techniques have been employed to improve crop water stress analysis, the use of thermal point 
clouds remain relatively unexplored. This thesis aims to enhance crop water stress analysis 
methodologies within PV through the integration of remote sensing, thermal imaging, and point 
cloud technologies. The study focuses on evaluating the viability of using thermal point clouds 
to generate 3D point clouds with CWSI values and 2D CWSI orthomosaics. Comparative 
analysis of these data models determines the appropriateness of employing thermal point 
clouds for CWSI calculation within PV. Additionally, the research explores the influence of 
different flight configurations (nadir, oblique, and their combination) on CWSI outcomes, 
seeking to identify the most effective workflow for CWSI calculation using point clouds. The 
findings exhibit promising potential, showing that thermal point clouds can be effectively 
employed to generate CWSI point clouds. The research findings indicate that point clouds offer 
a more comprehensive representation of the canopy compared to orthomosaics, thus providing 
more detailed information. Volume calculations show that the combined workflow yields the
most accurate results in terms of geometric representation (R2 = 0.72), followed by the nadir 
flight (R2 = 0.68), and finally the oblique flight (R2 = 0.54). This outcome indicates that the 
combined workflow is the optimal approach for CWSI calculations utilizing point clouds."
"Impact of the urban design on Urban Heat Islands:
The Use and Possibilities of Thermal Satellite Imagery","['Goor, Jurek van']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-07-28T01:01:48Z,EN,['Urban Heat Islands; Land Surface Temperature; Satalite imagery'],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"This thesis is about the use of thermal imagery sensors mounted to satellites to retrieve Land Surface 
Temperature data in the research to Urban Heat Islands. The purpose of the thesis is to see whether 
the UHI data derived from the LST will be similar to current and accepted models of UHI’s based on
the air temperature. Furthermore different urban design features such as, the percentage of green, 
the height of the green, the amount of water surface, the surface area of low albedo surfaces, the 
building age, the Sky View Factor, entropy and slope will be researched if they have a significant impact 
on the Urban Heat Island effect based on Land Surface Temperature. For this research several methods 
are used. To see whether the UHI data derived from the LST corresponds with the UHI data from the 
models a spatial autocorrelation is done to see whether the LST data is clustered together. Also a
geographically weighted regression is done. The results of the geographically weighted regression 
show if the UHI effect based on the LST explain and correspond with the differences in the UHI effect 
based on the air temperature. In addition a multiple linear regression is caried out to get an insight on 
which of the urban design features have an effect on the UHI effect based on the LST. The most 
important results are that the UHI effect based on LST on both the neighbourhood and the sub 
neighbourhood level show a clustered pattern which is expected from temperature data. Also the UHI 
effect based on LST has a very strong correlation with the UHI effect based on air temperature. The 
urban features that significantly correlated with the UHI effect based on LST are the percentage of 
green, the amount of water surface, the surface area of low albedo surfaces and the building age. From 
these the low albedo surface area has a positive correlation and the other features have a negative 
correlation. Recommended for future studies is to expand the research area and also include dates 
which are less warm and sunny to compare the UHI effect based on LST with the UHI effect based on 
air temperature."
Patient characteristics in observational studies of the relative risk of infection in people using diseases-modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis,"['Manyam, Meghanadh']","['Klungel, O.H.']",2023-07-28T01:01:41Z,EN,['Multiple sclerosis; Diseases modifying treatments; Real-world studies; Infections; Patient characteristics'],Epidemiology,"Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease. Infection is one of the
commonly reported outcomes in patients who are under disease-modifying treatments
(DMTs). The Influence of patient characteristics on risk of infection was well documented
in clinical trials. However, the understanding of patient characteristics and their impact
on treatment outcomes in real-world settings, particularly in observational studies,
remains limited.
Objective
To examine patient characteristics like demographics, geographical factors, and
socioeconomic factors in observational studies investigating the relative risk of infection
among individuals on DMTs for MS.
Methods
A systematic literature review was conducted according to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We
included observational studies that examined the impact of DMTs use on the occurrence
of infection in the MS population. A search was performed in PubMed and Embase and
key patient characteristics were extracted from the included studies. 
Results
A total of 30 studies were included in the final analysis. The sample size ranged from 56
to 15,375 participants. The mean age of the study participants ranged from 24.5 to 54.4
years. The proportion of women ranged from 60% to 100%. The geographic
representation of the included studies are Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and
Oceania. The disease duration ranged from 2 to 17.7 years. Ethnicity, Expanded Disability
Status Score (EDSS), Socio-Economic Status (SES), and treatment history were missing in
many studies.
Conclusion
Within this sub-group, our findings indicate that people who are under DMTs for MS
consists of younger adults and a higher proportion of women. The reporting of patient
characteristics such as ethnicity, SES, EDSS score, and previous use of DMTs were
inconsistently reported in the observational studies. This highlights the need for a
standardised reporting structure to gain a better understanding of the specific patient
characteristics that are associated with infectious risk."

school belonging. This study examined the effects of congruence with classmates’
minority/majority membership, origin country, immigrant generational status, and
socioeconomic (SES) on students’ belonging to peers and school. In addition, the moderating
effects of students’ own ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds were investigated. Children
from different ethnic backgrounds (N = 204) at primary schools in the Netherlands
participated in this study. School belonging was measured with the school- and peer subscales
of a Dutch version of the PSSM. Regression analyses showed that minority/majority, countryof-
origin, immigrant, and SES congruence are all important factors in determining students’
school belonging. However, the effects of these factors vary depending on the student's own
ethnic and SES background. The presence of same-ethnic peers promoted school belonging
for students with a migration background, whereas it reduced feelings of belonging for ethnic
Dutch students. In addition, both immigrant and SES congruence negatively affected students’
sense of belonging when students’ individual SES was taken into account. Therefore, it is
crucial to consider individual student characteristics when examining their sense of belonging.
The present study emphasizes the importance of recognizing the diversity within the minority
and majority groups and creating diverse school contexts. These findings provide valuable
directions for future research and practical implications aimed at fostering students’ sense of
belonging at school."
Dependence of wage inequality on spatial clustering of economic complexity in the Metropolitan Region of Amsterdam,"['Andriessen, Tim']","['Hernández Rodríguez, Eduardo']",2023-07-28T01:01:37Z,EN,['complexity; economic complexity; wage inequality; spatial dependende; metropoolregio amsterdam; mra; economic activities; sbi; nace'],Human Geography,"Recent research efforts have examined economic complexity as a determining factor for economic growth and a reducer of inequality. That relation is not universal, however, as highly complex economic activities seemingly only increase growth and wages for a select few higher educated, high-skilled workers. That may in turn lead to divergent growth, where workers employed in low-complexity activities are left behind, increasing inequalities. In cities and urban areas, where there is a concentrated mix of workers in low- and high-complexity activities, that effect is prominent. This research examines the spatial relation between complexity of economic activities and wage inequality in the Metropolitan Region of Amsterdam (MRA). An analysis of employment microdata is performed, combining methods of economic complexity indexation and spatial econometrics. While spatial clustering within the MRA of both economic complexity and wage inequality is established, there is no clear evidence for the spatial dependence of the relation between the two."

When cooperation between different areas of expertise in youth care does not work well, it can negatively affect the quality of care. In this study, 13 participants were interviewed and surveyed, including 9 collaboration partners of the municipality of Utrecht and 4 experts by experience. The findings highlight that communication, mutual trust, shared ownership of goals, willingness to collaborate and reflection on the process are important working elements. Two new active elements were identified during the interviews: expressing expectations and coordinating collaboration. The study shows that a coordinating role in interdisciplinary collaboration is complex or lacking. A recommendation is to assign a coordinating role to the interdisciplinary team. Future research is necessary to investigate the skills needed for the coordinating role. A further recommendation is to organize case-based evaluation and reflection sessions with the interdisciplinary team and the family. In addition, it is important to organize meetings to get to know each other better as a team to build trust.

It does so by means of a case study analysis of two EU coal regions: Lusatia in Germany and Moravia-Silesia in the Czech Republic. More specifically, this thesis examines the capacity of, and the conditions necessary for, community energy to improve distributive, procedural, and recognition justice, with a particular consideration of the specific challenges of coal regions. Indeed, this particular focus of community energy in coal regions represents the novelty of this research. Overall, this thesis confirms the high potential of community energy to enhance energy justice. In doing so, it validates and details the conditions necessary for community energy to enhance energy justice, those being: accessible energy prices, opportunities for public participation, and an inclusive design. More specifically, this thesis evidenced that a knowledge gap and lack of citizen engagement (as was the case in both case study regions) hinder the full realisation of community energy's potential. However, it also demonstrated the significance of information events and the role of municipal leadership to overcome the above-mentioned hindrances. In sum, by shedding light on the potential and conditions necessary for community energy to enhance energy justice in decarbonizing coal regions, as well as through noting a number of implications for community energy initiatives and policy makers, this thesis contributes to the broader understanding of inclusive and just energy transitions in Europe."
Give me some Slack: A Study Examining the Effectiveness of Emergency Reserves to Nudge Persistence after Subgoal Failure in a Dietary Context,"['Heidt, Lina']","['Weijers, R.J.']",2023-08-03T01:01:17Z,EN,['nudging; emergency reserves; goal persistence; subgoal failure; self-efficacy'],Applied Cognitive Psychology,"This study examined the effectiveness of using emergency reserves as a nudge to increase goal persistence after subgoal failure. The aim was to replicate and extend the findings of Sharif and Shu (2021) to a dietary context. Additionally, self-efficacy was examined as a possible mediator of the relationship between goal persistence after subgoal failure and emergency reserves. After a one-week-long baseline phase, participants received a daily vegetarian meal goal between one and four and had to reach it either five times a week (Easy group; n = 8), seven times a week (Hard group; n = 9), or seven times a week with two optional emergency reserves (Emergency Reserve group; n = 11) for four weeks. Results revealed that participants using emergency reserves did not persist significantly more after subgoal failure than participants of the Easy and Hard groups. This suggests that emergency reserves may not be suitable for a dietary context due to a higher share of possible constraints (e.g., social norms, and perceived benefits and barriers) or may only work when framed as clear approach-oriented goals. Further, a lack of goal importance and salience of the superordinate goal may have decreased the effectiveness of the present nudge. Self-efficacy was not found to be a mediator but may instead be a moderator of goal persistence and emergency reserves, which should be further examined in future research."

The first two hypotheses were that CSE and PE will have a strong positive relationship with IBs. Due to the extensive literature on inclusive leadership (IL), characterized by openness, availability, and accessibility, and IL’s importance on IBs, the current research additionally includes IL as a potential moderator. The next two hypotheses were that for higher levels of perceived inclusivity of one’s supervision, the CSE-IB and PE- IB relationships will be stronger. A cross-sectional study design was used to investigate the hypothesized relationships and convenience sampling was utilized to gather participants. Working adults (N = 141) filled out a self-administered online survey. The results displayed significance of CSE and PE as individual-level predictors of IBs but did not provide evidence for the moderation hypotheses. Post-hoc analysis and conceptual frameworks suggest a novel approach towards a more integrative framework of IBs, PE, and IL."

However, little is known about the mechanism at play between addictive use of social media and low self-esteem, and whether there are significant sex differences. The current cross-sectional study investigates whether negative use of social media (i.e., cyberbullying, negative content and focus on physical appearance) could be mediating the association between social media disorder (SMD) and self-esteem. Methods: The study involved 225 high-school students who completed a survey measuring background, SMD symptom severity, and psychosocial outcomes. Dimensional and categorical analyses were used to assess the correlation between both dimensions of SMD (i.e., heavy involvement and negative consequences) and self-esteem, and investigate sex differences. Several mediations were run to examine if negative use of social media mediated the association between both dimensions of SMD and self-esteem. Results: Both dimensions of SMD were positively associated to poor self-esteem but no significant sex difference was found for the association between SMD symptoms and self-esteem. However, the associations between cyberbullying and SMD (both heavy involvement and negative consequences), and between negative content and SMD negative consequences were significantly stronger for boys than girls. All three types of negative use of social media meditated the association between SMD heavy involvement and poor self-esteem. However, only focus on physical appearance mediated the association between SMD negative consequences and poor self-esteem. Methodological considerations limiting causal assertions permissible with non-experimental data are discussed."

This thesis constitutes a discourse analysis of the use of climate justice as a rhetorical strategy by two women’s NGOs seeking to further gendered perspectives to climate change at the UNFCCC, the Women’s Environment and Development Organisation (WEDO) and GenderCC - Women for Climate Justice (hereafter GenderCC). I identify three main articulations of climate justice: intra-societal, international, and systemic. By mapping the three articulations onto the organisations’ preparations, proceedings and follow-up of the Copenhagen and Paris conferences, the thesis examines the historical developments of the use in practice of the concept. The greater orchestration of civil society organisations by the UNFCCC Secretariat and the more established activity of the Women and Gender Constituency at Paris 2015 resulted in the greater institutionalisation of the concept of climate justice, and a more harmonised use of the concept between the two organisations. This compares to a misalignment apparent at Copenhagen 2009. While GenderCC exhibited a strong alignment to the more radical principles of the climate justice movement at Copenhagen, using systems-change rhetoric, this was toned down at Paris 2015. From WEDO’s small references to the intra-societal aspects of climate change at Copenhagen, the organisation moved to embracing the concept as an important rhetorical device at Paris 2015, finally employing a systemic articulation. In doing so, the research bridges recent efforts to understand the climate justice community as a community of practice and histories of feminist activism within the UNFCCC.""""]"

In response to this vision governments from all over the world, business, and NGOs committed themselves to a new global partnership based on goal setting as a key strategy. Existing research has examined how and in what ways NGOs can contribute to the attainment or progress of the SDGs. However, this thesis aims to fill a research gap as it focused on examining the ways in which the SDGs have influenced the work of environmental and developmental NGOs in the Netherlands. As a result, it aims to answer the research question, “what are the steering effects of the SDGs on environmental NGOs based in the Netherlands?”. To answer this question this thesis depended on the collection and analysis of official NGO information available online as well as interviews with experts and professionals working in the SDG and NGO fields. Collectively this information was discursively and interpretatively analyzed to (1) determine the discursive effects of the SDGs by NGOs and (2) to assess whether the SDGs further lead to normative effects in the work done by NGOs. Lastly, (3) it provided the opportunity to explain the degree of steering effects seen in each NGO sector. Ultimately this study argues that stronger steering effects, both discursive and normative, are experienced in the Netherlands by developmental NGOs. Furthermore, the lack of steering effects because of the SDGs by environmental NGOs are attributed two main categories of conditions or factors, namely due to political circumstances and the inherent characteristics of these organizations."
The Moderating Role of Self-Esteem in Trait Self-Control and Self-Control Behavior: A Quantitative Study,"['Arsenijević, Mila']","['Gillebaart, Marleen']",2023-08-03T01:01:11Z,EN,"['Trait self-control, self-control behaviour, self-esteem']","Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","This quantitative study investigates the potential moderating role of self-esteem in the relationship between trait self-control and self-control behavior. Self-control, the regulation of thoughts, emotions, and actions to achieve long-term goals, is associated with positive outcomes in various domains. However, individual differences in self-control traits exist, highlighting its non-uniform nature. Self-esteem, the subjective evaluation of self-worth, plays a crucial role in shaping thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. The study hypothesizes that individuals with high self-esteem would exhibit better self-control due to their beliefs in their abilities and engagement in self-esteem enhancing behaviors. Data was collected through an online survey and statistical analyses were conducted to examine the moderating role of self-esteem. The primary finding suggests a lack of association between self-control trait, self-esteem, and self-control behavior. Possible explanations include declining motivation and insufficient development of trait self-control and self-control resources among young individuals. Despite non-significant results, a positive predictive relationship between self-control and self-esteem emerged, indicating that higher self-control is associated with higher self-esteem. These findings present opportunities for future research on diverse self-control strategies to enhance self-esteem and contribute to the existing literature."
Detection and Prediction of the Rainy Season Onset in West Africa,"['Occelli, Lorenzo']","['Baatsen, M.L.J.']",2023-08-10T00:01:01Z,EN,['Rainy season onset; operational forecast; West Africa'],Climate Physics,"The onset of the rainy season is crucial for rain-fed farming in tropical countries. The timing of the onset can drastically influence the performance of the growing season, which subsequently impacts the food security of rural communities. Despite the high societal importance, the availability of operational forecast of the onset is limited, especially across the African continent. While there is little ambiguity about the overall behaviour of the West African Monsoon (WAM), there are several man-made definitions of its onset. Those definitions can address the onset both regionally and locally, the latter ones being the most commonly used.
In this study we tackle the operational prediction of the WAM onset, focusing on Ghana and neighbouring countries. The regional approach is the main focus of both the climatological research and the development of the forecasting algorithm. However, the local perspective has been analysed too, representing the common practise for onset’s forecasting. Firstly, the correlation between the onset and atmospheric variables is investi- gated in the period 1981-2021, using satellite-based rainfall records (CHIRPS dataset) and ERA5 re-analysed wind fields at different pressure levels. Afterwards, the operational prediction of the onset is produced by post-processing operational weather forecasts, issued by the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).
It is found that ECMWF rainfall forecasts (both medium-range and sub-seasonal) are the necessary ingredients of any prediction of the onset. Other atmospheric variables, such as wind fields at 925, 850, and 200 hPa, revealed to bring little to no advantage for the operational forecast of the onset, despite showing a clear correlation with the WAM in the climate. The best forecast performances are obtained with a threshold- based algorithm, which detects the onset imposing conditions on the amount and the temporal distribution of rainfall. Both regional and local onset’s forecast display promising performances in specific areas of the analysed region. Those areas are characterised by high spatial coherence of the rainfall pattern and can also be influenced by the adopted onset’s definition.
We conclude that the operational forecast of the onset is feasible with both the regional and the local approach, but only for a portion (about 47%) of the analysed domain. However, predicting the onset is far from straightforward and the obtained forecast are dependent on several semi-arbitrary choices, first and foremost on the chosen onset’s definition. Due to this dependency, it is of utmost importance to include the end-user needs in the development of any rainy season onset’s forecast."

This study contributes to prior HRI research by conducting a behavioral experiment (n = 194), focused on the impact of stereotyping effects concerning a robot’s gender and speech act on people’s evaluation of warmth, competence and discomfort. The experiment manipulates the Pepper robot’s gender (male or female) and the robot’s speech act (assertive or affiliative speech) in an online video
setting with a between-subjects design. The findings revealed that female robots are ascribed higher competence than male robots, independent of their speech act, and assertive robots are ascribed higher competence than affiliative robots, independent of their gender. Additionally, it was found that participants identifying as female tend to perceive the robot as more competent than those identifying as male. The evaluation of warmth or discomfort do not show significant effects, although there seems to be a tendency for assertive male robots to receive higher discomfort ratings. The results of this study suggest that robot gender as well as user gender and the associated norms and expectations may have complex effects on HRI, mainly in the competence dimension. This highlights the importance of designing social robotics without reinforcing gender bias. Moreover, it emphasizes the need for more theory-driven experiments to address gender issues in HRI, while considering the complexity and diversity of the concept of gender."

As earlier studies showed that nudge approval rates differ a lot, we looked at nudge approval and its predictors (i.e., actual effectiveness and perceived effectiveness) for the three menu nudges. Participants did a menu choice task and answered questions regarding nudge approval, intention to return, 
and perceived nudge effectiveness. We found a positive relation between the actual and perceived effectiveness of the nudges. Furthermore, the regression analysis showed that perceived effectiveness predicts higher nudge approval, while the actual effectiveness of the nudges did not predict higher or lower approval. Besides, higher age predicted slightly less nudge approval. Furthermore, individuals who studied at secondary vocational education approved less of the nudges than those who studied at university education. Lastly, we saw that appealing dish descriptions and chef’s recommendations, but not visual enhancements, resulted in significantly more vegetarian choices. Nudge approval and intention to return were high for all the nudges. So, individuals seem to accept nudges that are intended to influence their behaviour towards less meat consumption, which is among other things healthier and more sustainable."

Firstly, it was hypothesized that the performance anxiety training would have a positive effect on adaptive coping. Secondly, it was hypothesized that social support would moderate the effect of the training on adaptive coping, in which higher social support would cause a stronger effect of the training on adaptive coping. A randomized controlled trial was performed with participants who were randomly allocated to intervention or wait-list control groups. The sample was made up of N = 231 adolescents from diverse educational levels and ethnic backgrounds. A simple regression and a multiple regression analysis have been carried out. Results showed that the intervention had (1) no significant effects on adaptive coping, and (2) social support did not moderate this effect. However, a trend significant negative effect was found for the intervention. It is important to further study this effect, since finding and removing harmful sections of the intervention can potentially prevent harm from being done. Suggestions for future research are discussed. The intervention “Schoolstress de baas” could be improved upon to help students navigate academic stress and performance anxiety more effectively."
The association between the personality traits self-esteem and perfectionism with psychopathology and the possible mediation of psychological inflexibility.,"['Broek, Kyra van den']","['Bodden, D.']",2023-08-10T00:01:12Z,NL,['Self-esteem; perfectionism; psychological inflexibility; psychopathology; clinical; non-clinical'],"Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Goal: The transition phase from adolescence to young adulthood is often accompanied by various developmental changes, which can give rise to mental health problems. Problems with self-esteem and perfectionism are hereby linked to various forms of psychopathology. It is investigated whether a possible underlying mechanism, such as psychological inflexibility, can further explain these relationships. This study aims to see whether this psychological inflexibility is associated with the relationship of self-esteem and perfectionism with psychopathology. Methods: Participants were recruited from involved mental health institutions (N=53, clinical) and from the general Dutch population (N=339, non-clinical). To measure self-esteem, perfectionism, psychological inflexibility and psychopathology, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, Acceptance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth and the Youth Self Report were used. The data was examined using ANOVA, correlation analyses and mediation analyses via PROCESS. Results: In both groups, self-esteem, perfectionism, and psychological inflexibility were correlated with psychopathology and significant differences were found between the groups for each variable. Psychological inflexibility provided partial mediation in the relationship between self-esteem and perfectionism with psychopathology in both groups. Perfectionism in the clinical group was completely mediated by psychological inflexibility. Conclusion: Studying psychological inflexibility is important for both young adults with and without psychological problems to eventually help reduce psychopathology. An intervention that can be used for this purpose is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)."
Nadelige Effecten van Loyaliteitsconflicten en de Rol van Ouderlijke Warmte bij Kinderen uit Gescheiden Gezinnen: Een Onderzoek naar Internaliserende Problemen,"['Bal, Lenne']","['Dijk, R van']",2023-08-10T00:01:04Z,NL,['Internalizing problems; loyalty conflicts; parental warmth'],"Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Children with divorced parents are more likely to experience feelings of having to choose between their parents compared to their peers whose parents are still together. These loyalty conflicts have been linked to internalizing problems, which can have negative effects on children's development. Although previous studies have shown a positive association between loyalty conflict and internalizing problems, there is no consensus in the literature regarding whether parental warmth acts as a protective factor in this context. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between parental warmth, internalizing problems, and the potential protective role of parental warmth in a sample of 131 children (Mage = 11.79) and 129 parents from 76 recently separated families.
Consistent with the hypotheses, the findings revealed a positive association between loyalty conflict and internalizing problems. Additionally, maternal warmth was negatively correlated with internalizing problems. However, contrary to expectations, there was no significant association found between paternal warmth and internalizing problems, nor was parental warmth found to act as a protective factor. Given the limitations of the current research, caution should be exercised when interpreting these results.
These findings underpinned the need for increased awareness among divorced parents regarding the potential impact of their actions on their children. Furthermore, early interventions following divorce could be implemented to mitigate the adverse effects of loyalty
conflicts on children's internalizing problems."
Moral Injury and Moral Self-Image in Healthcare Workers: Centrality of Event as a Moderator,"['Yazıcı, Irem']","['Rie, Simone de la']",2023-08-08T00:01:54Z,EN,[],Clinical Psychology,"Moral Injury (MI) is a construct that refers to the severe distress, and functional impairments individuals may experience after exposure to traumatic events violating their moral beliefs and values. MI, encompassing two dimensions, MI-Self (violations by oneself) and MI- Others (violations by others), may conflict with one’s morals and challenge their moral integrity and self which may lead to developing adverse psychological outcomes. There is growing recognition of MI in healthcare, and the present study aimed to widen the scope of MI and its possible associations with different psychological constructs in a healthcare context. A simple regression analysis was conducted between MI (with MI-Self and MI-Others independently) and moral self-image, to see if MI did challenge one’s moral integrity and influence their moral self- image, as well as a moderation analysis between MI (X), moral self-image (Y), and centrality of (morally injurious) event (M). Additionally, a multiple regression analysis was performed to explore the association of these three separate variables to PTSD. 95 participants completed an online survey with five questionnaires on MI and psychological well-being. Results showed significant positive association between MI and moral self-image (for the subscales, same results only for MI-Others), and nonsignificant moderation of centrality of event, and MI and centrality of event significantly predicted PTSD, while moral self-image was nonsignificant. Further research is needed to understand these associations better."
De relatie tussen ervaren ouderlijke emotionele steun en het prosociale gedrag van adolescenten en de modererende rol van het empathisch vermogen van adolescenten in de late adolescentie.,"['Foppen, Mandy']",[],2023-08-10T00:01:10Z,NL,['Prosocial behaviour; adolescence; emotional support; empathy'],"Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Prosocial behavior in adolescents is crucial for maintaining relationships and is positively associated with quality of life. The period of adolescence seems to be of enormous importance in the development of prosocial behavior. Prosocial behavior increases until late 
adolescence after which it stabilizes. However, there are still many uncertainties about what factors play a role in the development of this behaviour. Parents, through emotional support, seem to be able to play a role in promoting prosocial behavior in adolescents, as this provides a secure foundation to develop psychosocial skills. This study focuses on the relation between 
perceived parental emotional support and the prosocial behavior of adolescents and the possible moderating role of adolescents' empathic abilities during late adolescence. Data was used from 383 adolescents and parents; the participants are part of the longitudinal RADAR study. Adolescents reported annually on their prosocial behavior, perceived parental emotional support and empathic ability. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis shows that there is a relation between perceived parental emotional support and adolescents' prosocial 
behavior. This relation does not appear to be moderated by the empathic capacity of adolescents. The results of this study can contribute to the development of interventions to promote prosocial behavior in adolescents"

Improvement and testing of a Clinical Deterioration Model for the Continuous Data-Driven Monitoring in Critical Congenital Heart Disease","['Giacinto Villalobos, Alice']","['Nijman, Joppe']",2023-08-11T00:02:19Z,EN,['Mahalanobis distance; critical care; Support Vector Machine; Congenital Heart Disease'],Applied Data Science,"[""""Introduction:
Continuous monitoring of vital signs is crucial in paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) to detect clinical deterioration. This study focuses on critically ill paediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) who underwent cardiac interventions in the first year of life. To help medical practitioners with the big amount of monitoring data, a data-driven model for automated detection of clinical deterioration and instability was developed. This model used the Maahlanobis distance of 5 vital parameters combined and a one-class support vector machine model. The goal of this study is to improve the existing machine learning algorithm through a) broadening statistical foundation for data-based cutoff values, b) exploring an alternative method for splitting stable from unstable timepoints (lactate) and c) creating new baselines for the comparison of the Mahalanobis distance. 

Methods:
For the broadening statistical foundation for the data-based cutoff values (80th percentile) a Local Outlier Factor methodology was used. The resulting outlier scores and k-distances were placed in density graphs to locate the start of the outliers. With the new percentile, a new SVM model was developed. The alternative method for splitting stable from unstable timepoints was lactate measurements. Lactate levels in blood are commonly used to determine if a patient is unstable. Thereafter measurements < 2 mmol/L were labeled as stable and fed into a new SVM model. The new baselines were created using the weighted moving average of the medians of the Mahalanobis measurements. The modified models were evaluated by a physician using visualizations that compared the models results with the vital parameters of new patients. 

Results:
The modified models showed good evaluation metrics, except for specificity. They accurately identified stable periods but not unstable periods. The use of lactate measurements and smoothing the Mahalanobis baseline improved the model's performance, especially in terms of specificity. However, it is suspected that not all unstable periods are outliers, which would explain the low specificity. 

Conclusion:
The modified models provide accurate detection of stable periods. The models could be used to schedule interventions, minimize disturbances during rest periods and reduce alarm fatigue. Further improvements can be made by incorporating additional data sources, and refining the classification of unstable periods. Future research should focus on real-time validation and testing in a clinical setting to optimize the model's performance and usability.

Dynamic Reoptimization of Transportation for Elderly and Disabled,"['Kuijpers, Nick']","['Rooij, Johan van']",2023-08-11T00:02:30Z,EN,"['metaheuristic, paratransit organization, DARP, DDARP, GRASP, Simulated annealing, operations research, local search']",Computing Science,"In this master thesis, we address the challenge of dynamically replanning transportation services for individuals with reduced mobility in the context of Valys: a paratransit agency in the Netherlands. High financial costs and the need for reducing greenhouse gas emissions have put pressure on paratransit agencies to improve their operational efficiency of transport services. Dynamic replanning can prevent changes from rendering the schedule created a day in advance inefficient, thereby averting delays, missed deliveries, and additional expenses. Furthermore, it can enhance flexibility for paratransit users, allowing same-day bookings instead of a day or more in advance. 

We propose a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) with evolutionary Path Relinking as a solution to the challenges of dynamic replanning. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply GRASP in this field. Therefore, we provide numerical evidence for our GRASP in comparison with a widely used simulated annealing (SA) method. Comparative analysis with an SA approach demonstrates that our GRASP outperforms SA significantly in the setting of limited computation time, typically encountered in real-time planning scenarios. Our GRASP approach relies on high-quality start solutions for better overall solutions, and we provide qualitative insight into the influence of the start solution on the performance. At last, we demonstrate that our GRASP approach is better at frequent real-time replanning than an SA approach. Overall, our findings highlight the effectiveness of our GRASP in addressing the challenges of dynamic replanning.

Furthermore, we assess the opportunity gap of dynamic rescheduling with respect to not rescheduling, quantifying the potential improvement based on the cumulative number of changes. Our results show predictable gains ranging from 3.0 to 16.8 depending on the number of changes. These gains correspond to a decrease in service time from 150 to 600 hours per day. Our GRASP algorithm can effectively close the opportunity gap, improve service delivery, and enhance customer satisfaction."
Detecting deterioration in patients with congenital heart diseases at the pediatric intensive care unit,"['Mee Mendes, Daniel van der']","['Nijman, Joppe']",2023-08-11T00:02:25Z,EN,['Healthcare; Infants; Congenital heart disease; Deterioration; Machine Learning; Classification'],Applied Data Science,"Critical congenital heart disease (cCHD) is present in two to three of every 1,000 newborns. Children diagnosed with cCHD are admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and closely monitored to ensure the highest possible quality of healthcare. During this period large quantities of continuous data streams are collected. The aim of this study is to analyze these large quantities of data using machine learning techniques such as random forest and boosting to provide insights in detecting deterioration by classifying periods as stable and unstable. The data consisted of 86 patients with information on five vital signs: heart rate, respiratory rate, invasive mean blood pressure, oxygen saturation and regional cerebral oxygen saturation. Pre-processing steps were necessary to transform the data and generate artificial labels for model training. Using the pre-processed data, hyperparameter tuning was performed, and final models were created. Based on these models, classifications were made on a left-out dataset consisting of nine patients. These model classifications are compared with a clinical classification established by a medical expert. The findings revealed an accuracy range of 64.4% to 87.1%, a sensitivity range of 66.0% to 97.3%, and a specificity range of 23.1% to 94.3%. These numbers demonstrate generally favorable accuracy and sensitivity scores. However, some models had very low specificity scores, indicating large amounts of true unstable periods were not classified as unstable. Relying on such a model would result in missing many critical situations at the PICU. Nevertheless, some models showed great potential. This study highlights that machine learning techniques such as random forest and boosting can be used to provide insights in detecting deterioration in patients. Consequently, it is recommended to explore the best performing models further and assess if further improvements are possible. Additionally, it is important to analyze the reasons behind certain incorrect classifications to enhance the understanding of the model. Finally, choosing a best model depends on the task at hand and should be considered carefully."
Information Coverage Based Integration Test Selection,"['Goede, Tom de']","['Prasetya, Wishnu']",2023-08-11T00:02:33Z,EN,['Code;Coverage;Test;Selection;Bazel'],Computing Science,Modern software development approaches promote automated testing as key concepts for quality control. During development software changes are continuously integrated to the mainline code- base requiring test suites to be reviewed. With the growing nature of codebases and the recent monorepo trend the industry has implemented solutions for incremental software building and testing. These solutions work well for unit tests that have a limited set of dependencies but fall short of integration test scenarios where large parts of the codebase are dependent upon. In this thesis we survey theoretical research that uses code coverage data for test case selection. Using these methods we extend the existing model of build systems with coverage concepts and implement and then study this in a modern build system called Bazel. Additionally we propose a generalization of the code coverage algorithm as information coverage that further reduces the need to execute integration tests. Finally we research the efficiency of our methods in a real industry setting and find that we can reduce test case selection rates by 62% and 73% respectively.

Reference Counting with Reuse in Roc,"['Teeuwissen, Jelle']","['Swierstra, W.S.']",2023-08-11T00:02:28Z,EN,"['garbage collection,roc,reference counting,reuse analysis,drop specialisation']",Computing Science,"Most functional programming languages use a tracing garbage collector to automatically
reclaim unused memory. But tracing garbage collection reclaims garbage memory at an un-
specified time, which results in stop-the-world pauses, an increase in peak memory usage, and
the inability to perform in-place mutations. Instead, a reference counting garbage collector
can be used. Having the exact reference count of a structure allows for in-place mutation
and the immediate reclamation of unused memory, at the cost of runtime overhead. The
reference counting and reuse algorithm Counting Immutable Beans from Ullrich and de Moura
attempts to reduce this overhead by borrowing references. However, their reuse imple-
mentation can lead to an arbitrary increase in peak memory usage. The reference counting
algorithm Perceus from Reinking et al opts for precise reference counting instead, resulting
in garbage free programs. Programs that can be further improved by cancelling out matching
opposite reference counting operations with drop specialisation and with the drop guided reuse
algorithm from Lorenzen and Leijen. Despite both reuse algorithms showing excellent
performance for simple programs, they are unable to fully utilise reuse opportunities across
join points. We use Roc, a purely functional programming language, to compare the previ-
ous Counting Immutable Beans implementation to an extended version of Perceus with drop
guided reuse. We show that our new implementation decreases reference counting overhead,
increases memory reuse, and is competitive with functional programming languages that use

Data Donation can be an option for collection of data the human behavior researchers need without ethical risk. The application of Data Download Packages (DDPs) for Data Donation is popular in human behavior research for its secrecy, integrity, availability, and controllability features. But errors can occur in every step of data collection and wrangling. Google manages data obtained from user devices according to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It creates DDPs according to its standard. One popular format among them is a Google Semantic Location History Format (GSLH) with a JSON file. The errors in the current DDPs by Google cause troubles for human behavior researchers using the Data Donation System as their expectation which means measuring the participants’ geo-data accurately as their analytical foundation.
In this paper, the key question will be how to handle the data error inside Google Semantic Location History Format. We investigate the quality of logs on two activity types, namely ""Walking "" and “Cycling” in the JSON file of GSLH DDPs to investigate whether these activity types are classified as reasonable in the data context. Through our designed workflow pipeline, namely flagging and imputation, clear data error should be limited, the quality of data should be improved and eventually, validation of analysis results for human behavior research should be enhanced. In the end, we find that a large proportion (22.6%) of data errors about activity type in our pilot data source through our processing pipeline, the imputation can be feasible although more resources are needed for ensuring the parameters and testing the validity."

Es betrifft hier das mündliche „Schoolexamen“ in vwo 6, der letzten Klasse des höchsten Niveaus im niederländischen Sekundarunterricht. Sowohl Monologe als Gespräche werden berücksichtigt.
Im Theorieteil werden sechs Qualitätskennzeichen (QKZ) für gute mündliche Prüfungen (mP) formuliert. In gekürzter Form sind sie: QKZ 1 - eine mP ist valide und reliabel; QKZ 2 - eine mP misst Komplexität, Genauigkeit und Gewandtheit; QKZ 3 - eine mP hat ein passendes Beurteilungsverfahren; QKZ 4 - eine mP hat klare Lernziele und adäquate Vorbereitungsmöglichkeiten; QKZ 5 - eine mP erregt möglichst wenig Sprechangst; QKZ 6 - eine mP prüft die Sprache auf einem mit dem GER eingestuften Niveau. Auch werden im Theorieteil einige Verbesserungspotentiale auf Grund der Literatur aufgestellt.
Die Ergebnisse des empirischen Teils wurden mit einer Online-Umfrage gesammelt. 34 Deutschlehrkräfte, die alle in vwo 6 unterrichten, haben 20 geschlossene und offene Fragen beantwortet. Am meisten ist aufgefallen, wie groß die Variation an Prüfungsmethoden bei Gesprächsfertigkeit ist, trotz der landesweit einheitlichen Ziele. Durch die Unterschiede steht die Vergleichbarkeit zwischen Schulen unter Druck. Die Prüfungsmethoden bei monologischer Sprechfertigkeit sind viel einheitlicher: meistens Präsentationen.
Im Unterricht sprechen die Schüler*innen nicht genug Deutsch, was dazu führt, dass die Prüfung nicht genau der Vorbereitung entspricht.  Andere Verbesserungspotentiale sind zum Beispiel Aufgaben, die mehr zum alltäglichen Sprachgebrauch passen, unabhängige Kontrolle der Tests und Weiterbildung von Lehrkräften im Bereich Prüfungsentwicklung. Ein landesweiter einheitlicher Bewertungsbogen und eine bessere Gewährleistung des GER-Zielniveaus B2 sind konkretere Ratschläge.

It can represent a physical
system with restrictions on the degrees of freedom. Bracket generating distributions are a distinguished
class of interest in control theory: when the restriction on the system is given by a bracket generating distribution,
any configuration (e.g. position and orientation) can be obtained using the restricted directions
only.
This thesis focuses on fat distributions (also called strongly bracket generating distributions), which are,
in a sense, the most extreme case of bracket generating distribution. A lot is known about co-rank 1 fat
distributions (also called contact distributions), but much less is known for higher co-ranks.
We focus on co-rank 2 distributions that are induced by the canonical distribution on the Grassmann
bundle of 2-planes of a manifold. We define this class of distributions and refer to them as prolonged
distributions. To be precise, we look at co-rank 2 sub-bundles of the Grassmann bundle 2-Gr(TX) of
a 4-dimensional manifold X. We consider the canonical distribution on 2-Gr(TX) and restrict it to the
given sub-bundle. The main question we investigate is under what conditions this restriction defines a fat
distribution on the sub-bundle manifold.
Our contributions go in two directions.
First, we assume the 4-dimensional base manifold X to be endowed with an almost complex structure J.
We consider the rank-2 sub-bundle of the Grassmann bundle consisting of the 2-planes invariant under
the almost complex structure J. This sub-bundle forms a 6-dimensional manifold and the fibers are in fact
complex Grassmannians. We show that the prolonged distribution of this sub-bundle is a fat distribution
of co-rank 2.
Furthermore, we consider a rank-2 fiber bundle M over a 4-dimensional base manifold X and a bundle
map that maps M into the Grassmann bundle 2-Gr(TX); we identify necessary and sufficient local
conditions for the bundle map to induce a fat prolonged distribution D of co-rank 2 on the fiber bundle
M. More precisely, we show that requiring the prolonged distribution D on M to be fat is equivalent to
requiring that the fibers of M –that map into the corresponding Grassmannian-fiber via the bundle map–
are transverse to what we call the infinitesimal cone field on the Grassmannian. As a consequence, we
show that, in this case, if M is closed, the fibers of M are either 2-spheres or projective planes, which is
the main result of this thesis."
A Characterization of Energy Drought Events in the Netherlands,"['Magan, Isaï']","['Hu, Jing']",2023-08-18T00:01:48Z,EN,['Energy; Variable Renewable Energy; Climate change; Energy drought; Dunkelflaute; Wind; \nSolar; Capacity factor; Netherlands; Copula; Co-occurrence; Extreme value analysis; Peak-over-threshold'],Energy Science,"The increasing importance of renewable energy supply in the transition to carbon neutral energy systems 
highlights the need of an adequate understanding of the associated risks to energy supply. Variable 
renewable energy sources are inherently dependent on meteorological conditions, and as such could 
provide insufficient energy for certain periods of time. In this study, a characterization is performed on 
such energy drought events in the Netherlands. ERA-5 reanalysis and MERRA-2 climate data is used to 
model the performance of solar PV and wind power generation. Statistical approaches are used to 
investigate these events on provincial, sub-national and national scale. It has been found that the province 
least susceptible to energy drought occurrence is Zeeland, whereas Gelderland, Limburg, Noord-Brabant, 
Overijssel and Utrecht are most likely to experience energy droughts. Additionally, copula theory is used 
to investigate probabilities of the co-occurrence of energy drought events between regions and 
technologies. When provinces are aggregated to sub-national regions, this research shows that
constructed copula models capture tail events in the distribution of power generation in the form of 
energy droughts well. A co-occurrence between 9.61% and 14.9% has been found for ED events between 
the two defined sub-national regions, with return periods between 67.7 and 117 days. Finally, extreme 
value theory is applied to investigate extremely long-lasting energy droughts. Using the Peak-OverThreshold method, a VaR-95% value between 27.2 and 46 hours and a CVaR-95% value between 41.6 and 
58.1 hours has been found for extreme energy drought duration in the Netherlands. Furthermore, 50-
year and 100-year ED durations are found to be between 84 and 99 hours and 91 and 107 hours, 
respectively. The results of this study can be incorporated in the planning of future renewable energy 
installations, and for grid operators to determine and manage the risk of black outs more accurately."

that the perception of students' autonomy-supportive and controlling teaching relates to the quality

that student performance was modest but positively associated with autonomy-supportive teaching. 
Autonomy-supportive teaching was positively related to autonomous forms of motivation and 
negatively to controlled forms of motivation. Significant indirect effects indicated the mediating role

Uit tientallen jaren wetenschap blijkt dat criminaliseren ervoor zorgt dat sekswerkers gedwongen worden om ondergronds te werken, wat leidt tot meer criminaliteit in de sector. Bovendien verergert dit beleid het stigma. Volgens sekswerkers en wetenschappers wordt het beleid beïnvloed door maatschappelijke discoursen die gebaseerd zijn op moraliteit. Mensen hebben bijvoorbeeld een stereotype beeld van het werk, gebruiken denigrerende termen en behandelen sekswerk anders dan andere beroepen. Hierdoor sluit het beleid niet aan op de behoeften van sekswerkers. In deze masterscriptie heb ik onderzocht welke discoursen over sekswerk in Nederland worden gebruikt en welke stigmatiserende gevolgen deze hebben. Ik heb discoursen geanalyseerd in het beleid, in de media en die door sekswerkers zelf worden gebruikt. Uit deze analyse blijkt dat er verschillende perspectieven bestaan op sekswerk, die zowel stigmatiserende als destigmatiserende gevolgen hebben voor sekswerkers. Drie discoursen zijn dominant: sekswerkers als verstoring van de openbare orde, sekswerkers als slachtoffers die hulp nodig hebben en sekswerkers als normale arbeiders. Het deconstrueren van het stigma is een eerste stap naar meer sociale rechtvaardigheid voor sekswerkers."
Impact of the Spring Distraction System on scoliotic spine morphology: an MRI- and CT-based analysis,"['Block, Nick De']","['Bovenschen, Niels']",2023-08-28T23:00:51Z,EN,['Spring Distraction System; Scoliosis; Early Onset Scoliosis; Growth-friendly Implant; Surgery; Morphology;'],Geneeskunde,"Study Design
Prospective cohort study

Summary of Background Information
Early Onset Scoliosis (EOS) is a three-dimensional (3D) deformation of the spine and trunk below the
age of 10, which can lead to pulmonary insufficiency and even death. At UMC Utrecht, the Spring
Distraction System (SDS) was developed to provide dynamic and continuous reduction of the scoliotic
spine while allowing for near-physiological spinal growth. This study investigated morphometric
differences in the intervertebral discs (IVDs) and vertebral bodies (VBs) before and at an average of 1.5
years after SDS implantation surgery in a prospective study cohort. For this analysis, MRI imaging and
CT-based imaging was used to assess the 3D shape of individual IVDs and VBs, as well as of the relative
position of the nucleus pulposus (NP) in the annulus fibrosus.

Methods
3D morphology of peri-apical levels of ten EOS patients were compared before surgery and at least 1-
year after surgery using MRI- and CT-based imaging. Peri-apical VBs and IVDs were semiautomatically segmented to determine the lengths of the anterior, posterior, convex and concave aspects
of these structures, as well as their rotation, while taking their 3D-orientation into account. Additionally,
NP morphology was analyzed using MRI-based IVD reconstructions.
Results
Primary thoracic curves showed a height increase in every segment, except for the IVD convexity, with
a mean gain of 7.6 ± 3.1 mm. This increase was mainly seen in the VB (7.0 ± 5.2 mm), compared to the
IVD (0.6 ± 3.1 mm) Relative changes were most prevalent along both the VB and IVD concavity
showing 17% and 13% height increase respectively, compared to 11% and -6% in the convexity.
Reduction of the deformity was mainly seen in the IVD where concave/convex length ratios normalized
from 0.65 to 0.80, translating to 5.9 mm of coronal wedging reduction. Anterior/posterior ratios
normalized from 1.25 to 1.21, indicating less lordosis. The VB also showed wedging reduction, but to a
much lesser extent. Here, concave/convex ratios normalized from 0.85 to 0.89, indicating a 1.8 mm
coronal correction, however anterior/posterior ratios increased from 0.97 to 1.00.

Both VB and IVD rotation appeared stable pre- versus post-surgery showing a positive correlation
between rotational severity and (peri-)apical level.

The NP center of volume showed a pre-surgery mean distance to the IVD center of volume of 4.4 ± 1.1
mm. This distance decreased to 2.6 ± 1.0 mm post-surgery.

Conclusion
The reduction of scoliotic spines in EOS patients using the SDS results in a transition towards a more
physiological shape, affecting both IVD and VB morphology. Most correction of the deformity takes
place in the IVD while the spine continues to grow in the VBs. A trend is shown where this bony growth
is modulated, resulting in decreased coronal wedging. Additionally, a trend is observed where the NP
takes on a more centralized position in the IVD."
"The Effect of Belief in Grief-Stages, Self-Blame, & Social Conformity on the Grieving Process","['David Augustine Boudville, David']","['Avis, Kate']",2023-08-29T00:00:49Z,EN,['stages of grief; complicated grief; social conformity; self-blame; exploratory questionnaire'],Clinical Psychology,"Since belief in Stages of Grief Models remain widespread despite increasing concern about their validity among mental health professionals, this paper investigates the hypothesis that it predicts increased complicated grief and whether self-blame and social conformity moderate this relationship. Linear regression was used to test the first hypothesis, that belief in grief-stages predict increased complicated grief reactions; two moderation analyses test the second, that social conformity moderates this, and third, that self-blame does likewise. Although results confirmed these trends, none achieved significance. This was largely attributed to convenience-based sampling methods not focusing on clinical groups, as it was suggested that nonclinical populations might believe grief-stages without harm. Thus, the convenience-based sampling method and use of scales unable to identify nuances of how belief might not be harmful may have been important limitations. Given important implications like a cognitive account of how belief in grief-stages maintains complicated grief in clinical populations and whether all such belief should be treated as traumatic, future research is merited into the role that population and other indicated factors play in the hypothetical effect of belief in grief stages upon complicated grief."

3.5 million low-literate individuals in 2024. Low-literacy individuals encounter daily
challenges in areas such as healthcare, education and work. Numerous low-literate
individuals remain unidentified because of intimidating testing methods and provided help by
others. Incomplete insights in the actual problem makes it challenging to provide solutions
for low-literate individuals. Speech-to-text software can provide solutions to investigate the
actual literate levels of individuals by examining word recognition based on audio signals.
This provides a less intimidating research method since it examined how well the software
converts speech to text, rather than the performance of the low-literate individual. In current
research, word recognition is investigated by simulating speech-to-text software, while
examining the factors contributing to word recognition; age of acquisition and frequency.
Current study focuses on the question to what extent the performance on a visual word
recognition task is dependent on age of acquisition and frequency of used words. Results
supported the influence of age of acquisition and frequency of used words on the reaction
time and error rates on a visual word recognition task. Furthermore, the effect of age of
acquisition and frequency of used words is not significantly greater when having to reject the
words in the visual word recognition task. Current study offers a more thorough

Fast-Track for Prostate Cancer and the Protective Factor of IPSS-score on Deviating MRI Results.,"['Gravendeel, Sophie']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-08-28T23:00:58Z,EN,[],Geneeskunde,"Introduction. Prostate cancer requires a faster diagnostic pathway due to the long time to diagnosis and patient anxiety. To address this issue, a quick diagnostic route <36 hours was implemented. Previous research highlighted lower urinary tract symptoms as a protective factor for prostate biopsies. Therefore, our study aims to individualize the fast-track by exploring the association between the International Prostate Symptom Score and deviant magnetic resonance imaging scans.
Methods. Retrospective single-center cohort study, aiming to associate the International Prostate Symptom Score with abnormal magnetic resonance scans in men who had undergone the prostate cancer fast-track. Male patients participated from July 2022 to March 2023 at St. Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein. Primary outcome: abnormal magnetic resonance imaging scan, secondary outcomes: biopsy rates, prostate cancer diagnosis. Group 1: PI-RADS score 1-2 scans, group 2: PI-RADS score 3-5 scans. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used.
Results. 268 men were enrolled. Multivariate analysis showed significant associations between magnetic resonance imaging scan abnormalities and International Prostate Symptom Score (OR 0.952 [0.908-0.997]; p 0.036), IPSS mild vs. severe (OR 3.844 [1.236- 11.952], p 0.020), IPSS severe vs. mild (OR 0.260 [0.084-0.809]; p 0.020, irritative LUTS at referral (OR 0.420 [0.186-0.946]; p 0.036) and LUTS presence (OR 0.549 [0.304-0.989]; p 0.046).
Discussion. Based on our findings, upon confirmation though a prospective study, it appears that in the future, men with a mild IPSS score should consistently be placed in the fast-track, while men exhibiting irritative lower urinary tract symptoms should not."

It has found larger-than-expected misfits and considerable adaptational pressures. The domestic change this brings depends largely on future developments, but it can be concluded that significant constraining factors limit paradigmatic domestic change through the RRF."
Investor reactions towards morally driven market exits: Researching the impact of an exit radicality on stock returns in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian War,"['Tsekhanska, Diana']","['Dirksen, Erik']",2023-09-06T10:01:06Z,EN,['Ethics-induced/ market exit/ Russo-Ukrainian War/ abnormal returns/ exit radicality/ signaling'],International Management,"This research investigates stock returns of enterprises that announced their intent to exit the Russian market amid the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Distinguishing between radicalities of withdrawals, my study seeks to determine if a typically negative relationship between stock returns and market exits remains valid when an exit is publicly announced as ethics-induced, rather than profit-driven. I predict that cumulative abnormal returns around the day of an announcement will be higher for enterprises intending to withdraw fully, as they send stronger signal of their socially responsible stance. I establish that announcing a complete exit from Russia, in fact, does lead to higher abnormal returns, although market reaction regarding an exit radicality is contingent upon firm-specific characteristics and general economic and political outlooks. Additionally, I find that investors tend to react more actively to the partial withdrawal news, which can signify their concern regarding future growth prospects and profitability when an enterprise maintain its partial presence in Russia. Overall, my paper contributed towards understanding the connection between geopolitical aggression, morally driven market exits and subsequent investor reactions, and provided evidence for reverse correlations. However, given limitations associated with the sample size, I urge to interpret my findings with caution, while also strongly encourage scholars to further explore the topic and broaden the concepts presented in the paper."

In order to analyze this impact, various financial metrics and indicators are employed to assess the potential risks and challenges faced by these specialized REITs. Additionally, the paper seeks to investigate whether there are disparities in the financial performance between data and communication infrastructure REITs. To motivate the analysis, a multiple linear regression model is presented, which highlights the influence of the 3-month and 10-year Treasury rates on the financial metrics and indicators. The findings of this study demonstrate that the financial performance of these REITs is significantly and negatively affected by both short-term and long-term interest rate increases, with the exception of the D/E and D/A ratios, which show a contrasting pattern. Furthermore, notable distinctions between the data and communication infrastructure REITs are not apparent, except for the observation that rises in both interest rates have a more prominent effect on rental revenues from data center real estate. Moreover, evidence suggests that global operating communication infrastructure REITs experience a more dominant impact on their financial performance do to rising interest rates, as their value increases. However, given the limited representation of the REITs in the dataset, the comparative results should be interpreted cautiously, as they may not accurately reflect the broader landscape. As the findings differ from existing literature that suggests the financial performance of the specialized REIT sector in the US remains unaffected by interest rate fluctuations, it is crucial for future research to underscore the vulnerability of foreign investment risk and the unique characteristics and market dynamics of data and communication infrastructure REITs that differentiate them from the broader specialized REIT sector."
"Fresh Perspectives, Greater Innovation: The Vital Role of New 
Employees","['Darwish, Abdallah']","['Balen, Timo van']",2023-09-06T10:01:00Z,EN,[],Business Development and Entrepreneurship,"The introduction of new employees into an organization often ignites a spark of innovation and 
creative problem-solving, primarily due to their unique perspectives and experiences. This study 
explores the interplay between this influx of fresh ideas and the pre-existing familiarity within 
work teams. The research uncovers an intriguing dynamic: while team familiarity of newcomers
may enhance communication and coordination, it can also unintentionally stifle the innovative 
potential brought by these new employees. Evidence suggests that when teams become too 
familiar, there is a propensity towards groupthink and resistance to novel ideas, creating an 
environment where the innovative contributions of new employees may not be fully leveraged. 
This research hence underscores the need to properly manage team familiarity in ventures, by 
cultivating an environment that welcomes new employees with low familiarity, thereby 
augmenting the prospects for innovation. These conclusions highlight the need for proactive 
measures in forging an organizational culture that strikes a balance between the reassuring 
nature of familiarity and the invigorating allure of novelty."

The results also have implications for vendors, as they can develop better strategies for planning and anticipating organizations' reactions to this emerging technology."
Feelings of Psychological Safety and Autism-traits: Exploring the Moderating Role of Sensory Sensitivity in the General Population,"['Ringoir, Lisa']","['Gerritsen, Lotte']",2023-09-06T10:00:48Z,EN,['psychological safety; autism-traits; ASD; sensory sensitivity; information processing; feelings of safety; neuroception'],Clinical Psychology,"Background 
Feelings of psychological safety are recognized central to mental health. According to the Intense World theory, individuals with autism-traits might be particularly vulnerable for disruptions in feelings of safety due to sensory sensitivities, which make them vulnerable to identify situations as unsafe. As autism-traits occur on a spectrum, these difficulties are also seen in the general population. This explorative quantitative study examines the relationship between autism-traits and feelings of psychological safety with sensory sensitivity as moderator in the general population. 

Methods 
Cross-sectional questionnaire data was collected from a sample of 160 individuals (Mage = 25.5, SD = 8.9, 76% female). Participants completed questionnaires assessing autism-traits (M-ASD), sensory sensitivity (GSQ), and feelings of psychological safety (NPSS).

Results 
The results indicated that individuals with high autism-traits experienced significant lower feelings of psychological safety (MNPSS = 105.39, SD = 16.80) in comparison to individuals with low autism-traits (MNPSS = 120.26, SD = 11.30). Sensory sensitivity as moderator was found to moderate this relationship, particularly in individuals with high autism-traits. 

Conclusion
These findings suggest that individuals with heightened autism-traits may experience lower feelings of psychological safety in general, while sensory sensitivities increased this relationship. These findings shed light on the underlying processes in their interactions with the environment. Further longitudinal research is recommended to unravel the complex interplay between autism-traits and sensory sensitivity as potential core symptom, and their collective influence on lower feelings of safety. This can contribute to the development of targeted interventions and improve the quality of life for individuals with autism-traits, both clinical and non-clinical."

Therefore, an explorative quantitative research approach was used to identify the most important factors contributing to the immigration behavior of international students in the Netherlands. After conducting a quantitative survey, the obtained data of 134 graduates was used to create regression models explaining the immigration behavior of international graduates. It has been shown that factors related to the job market, such as the perceived attractiveness of the Dutch job market as well as the effort a student has put into entering the job market during their education are significantly related to the immigration behavior. In addition, having a partner in the Netherlands is also positively related to immigration."

Results show no significant indication of a greenium for GBs but do show evidence for the presence of a

KNVB WorldCoaches is een middenveldorganisatie die zich committeert binnen de Sport for Development and Peace (SDP) sector. Om te kunnen bepalen hoeveel impact KNVB WorldCoaches levert worden MEL-aanpakken ontworpen om de Theory of Change (ToC) te meten. De afgelopen jaren heeft KNVB WorldCoaches veel ervaring opgedaan over MEL en heeft, mede door het Shiraka-project, uitgesproken inzicht te willen hebben in de manier waarop de afgelopen jaren de MEL-aanpakken zijn vormgegeven, zodat opgedane ervaringen over MEL niet verloren gaan. Aangezien elke MEL uniek is, wordt beoogd de cumulatieve kennis van afgeronde WorldCoaches-projecten te achterhalen aangaande het MEL.   
De praktijk wijst uit dat MEL niet eenduidig te vatten is omdat elk project verschilt. MEL is uniek, tijdrovend en doorgaans ontbreekt organisatiekennis over MEL. Uniformiteit binnen MEL kan hierop inspelen. Dit onderzoek is erop gericht om ervaringen over MEL van drie afgeronde WorldCoaches-projecten te achterhalen zodat kennis uit het verleden over MEL binnen KNVB WorldCoaches kan worden achterhaald, alsmede patronen en verschillen kunnen worden geduid, om aanknopingspunten te kunnen bieden om uniformiteit binnen MEL mogelijk te maken. Hierbij worden ook de invloeden vanuit consortia onderzocht om contextinvloeden op MEL mee te nemen. De onderzoeksvraag luidt: “Wat kan organisatorisch geleerd worden van de manier waarop de Monitoren, Evalueren en Leren (MEL) aanpakken van WorldCoaches-projecten zijn ingericht en uitgevoerd en wat is de invloed van partnerorganisaties in de consortia op hoe de MEL-aanpakken worden vormgegeven?” 
Uit de onderzoeksbevindingen blijkt dat het accent binnen de drie projecten hoofdzakelijk lag op een outputgerichte impactmeting waarbij de traditionele M&E-frameworks de overhand hadden. Hoewel binnen het SFD 16-19 project een participatief MEL-component aanwezig is, is het potentieel hiervan onvoldoende benut wegens discrepanties tussen de consortiumorganisaties. Hoewel het belang van de lokale context binnen elk project naar voren komt, komt het gedeelde leercomponent minimaal naar voren. Zo waren de M&E-frameworks binnen F4W 16-19 en SaHA 16-19 te rigide omdat de focus voornamelijk lag op verantwoording richting subsidiegever BuZa. Dit kan worden verklaard omdat BuZa, hoewel enigszins genuanceerd, een machtspositie inneemt in de consortia. In de praktijk hadden de consortiumorganisaties ruimte in de uitvoering van de frameworks, en omdat de organisaties hoofdzakelijk langs elkaar heen bewogen, alsmede dat iedere organisatie een eigen interventie had om de ToC na te streven, voerde iedere partij afzonderlijk de dataverzameling uit. In het verlengde hiervan bestond, zoals binnen F4W 16-19, geen eenduidigheid over het overkoepelende M&E-framework, waardoor ook verschillen tussen de organisaties ontstonden in de interpretaties van de mee te tellen aantallen begunstigden. Al met al zorgden de discrepanties en organisatorische verschillen ervoor dat gedeeld leren in de consortia niet reëel was. Ten slotte is onderzocht dat uniformiteit binnen MEL haalbaar is door organisaties een eigen MEL-strategie te laten ontwikkelen. 
Allereerst wordt aanbevolen dat de organisatieverschillen moeten worden overbrugd om gedeeld leren mogelijk te maken. Ook wordt aanbevolen om organisaties een MEL-strategie te laten ontwikkelen om het minder tijdrovend te maken. Om de frameworks beter aan te sluiten op het project wordt aanbevolen dat het potentieel van de frameworks initieel moeten worden geëxpliciteerd. Verder wordt aanbevolen MEL-budget op te nemen in de subsidieaanvraag om het leercomponent toe te voegen."
Aging with cystic fibrosis: CFTR’s influence on colorectal cancer,"['Derksen, Saskia']","['Beekman, Jeffrey']",2023-09-06T23:00:54Z,EN,['Colorectal cancer; CFTR; Cystic fibrosis'],Biology of Disease,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a severe genetic disease where mutations in the CFTR gene lead to thick mucus in the lungs which makes it difficult to breath. The development of new drugs has tremendously increased the life expectancy of many CF patients up to 82.5 years. Even though these new drugs are a huge breakthrough, the aging CF patients face new difficulties as they have a large risk to develop colorectal cancer (CRC). There is no clear explanation for the increased CRC risk yet, several studies describe different potential underlying reasons. Here, we summarize the current literature on the risk of CRC in CF patients and suggest directions for future research.
In the first part of this report we summarize relevant research papers about CRC in CF patients. The risk of CRC is significantly increased in CF patients compared to the normal population, especially after organ transplantation. Additionally, CF patients are generally younger when they develop CRC. Furthermore, studies on the risk of CRC in CF carriers reported conflicting results. Therefore, it remains uncertain if CF carriers have an increased risk of CRC as well.  We also looked into studies investigating CRC in patients without CF which reported CFTR mutations and defective CFTR protein. This suggest a relationship between CRC and defective CFTR even in non-CF patients.
In the second part of this report we focus on understanding the molecular mechanism behind the increased CRC risk in CF. CRC usually develops due to mutations that activate a cell signaling cascade called the Wnt/b-catenin pathway which effects cell division/proliferation. Multiple studies indicated that the mutated CFTR protein in CF patients can also activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and thereby contributes to the development of CRC. Several theories on how mutated CFTR leads to CRC development exist, this report has summarized two of them. First, as CFTR plays an important role in fluid homeostasis, mutated CFTR leads to an unbalanced fluid homeostasis which increases the pH in colon cells. This increased pH stabilizes certain protein interactions that eventually activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Additionally, the raised pH prevents cell death and stimulates cell division. Second, the CFTR protein normally interacts with proteins that decrease the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Mutated CFTR limits the function of these proteins thereby increasing the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
To conclude, we describe that CF patients indeed have an increased risk of CRC at a younger age, and especially after transplantation. CFTR regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway could be one of the major contributing factors although the exact molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Therefore, we propose further research in human organoids and CF patients, including carriers and non-CF CRC patients, to fully elucidate how mutated CFTR leads to CRC development. Future research may eventually contribute to an earlier diagnosis and better treatment of CRC in CF patients."
Human impact on the natural vegetation during the Middle and Late Holocene at the Nieuweveen pingo,"['Doorn, Vincent van']","['Donders, Timme']",2023-09-06T23:00:51Z,EN,['Palynology; Human impact; pingo ruin; Holocene; pollen record'],"Earth, Life and Climate","The Nieuweveen pingo is one of the many pingos present in the Eastern part of the 
Netherlands. But it is unique thanks to the large and continuous sedimentary record. 
Preliminary research of the Nieuweveen core showed very little human impact present at this 
site. Therefore, the aim of this research is to determine how and when human influence 
impacted the natural vegetation around the site. 45 samples were taken from the 
Nieuweveen core and the pollen were extracted and analyzed. Based on the obtained pollen 
record it became clear that humans influenced the area since 5500 cal. yr. BP. However, 
clear human impact on the environment around the Nieuweveen site did not happen until 
around 3500 cal. yr BP, which is extremely late. Comparisons with other well-known pingo 
remnants such as the Hijkermeer pingo, Mekelermeer pingo and Uddelermeer pingo show 
that the human impact on the Nieuweveen site was also very limited compared to other parts 
of the Netherlands. As a result the vegetation around this site gives a clear picture of the 
natural vegetation during most of the Holocene. Small scale farming, deforestation and 
establishing of settlements all influenced the area. Although some had more impact than 
others. Furthermore, changes in temperature and precipitation between 4200 cal. yr BP and 
3200 cal. yr BP were also important contributors to some of the changes in the natural 
vegetation, such as a rapid and sudden increase and later on a decline in Betula."
The effect of air filtration devices on transmission of infectious diseases in an educational setting: A literature review,"['Boer, Li Xiang den']","['Bruijning-Verhagen, Patricia']",2023-09-07T00:00:38Z,EN,[],Epidemiology,"ABSTRACT
Background: Respiratory infectious diseases are an important cause for morbidity and mortality. The transmission of infectious diseases in schools influences the incidence of these diseases in the rest of the population. It has been hypothesized that air filtration devices might be able to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases. In healthcare settings air filtration devices seem to be effective in reducing the aerosol particle concentration and infection rate. However, there is no overview of the available evidence of these devices in a school setting. Therefore, the aim of this study was to summarize the existing evidence on the effect of air filtration devices in educational settings. 

Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched in May 2023. Intervention studies that were conducted in a school setting were eligible. Modeling and simulation studies, and observational studies were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified version of the ROBINS-I tool. The details of the classroom, device and quantitative measurement of the effect were extracted. 

Results: Two studies met the inclusion criteria. The two studies were conducted in Germany after 2020. One was conducted at a primary school, the other at a secondary school. Both studies were non-randomized trials, that compared a classroom with and without air purifier. Neither of the included studies measured outcomes that were directly related to infectious disease transmission. They measured the aerosol particle concentration, particle size distribution, CO2 levels, and relative humidity. Overall, they were both found to have moderate risk of bias. The air purifiers were found to reduce the aerosol particle concentration by 88.9% and 95%, compared to 11.8%, while not using air purifiers reduced it by 11.8% and 30% respectively.  

Conclusion: None of the included studies measured outcomes related to infectious disease transmission. However, both studies concluded that using an air purifier with HEPA filter significantly reduced the aerosol particle concentration. Future research is necessary that uses outcome measures of infectious disease transmission, such as virus concentration or incidence of infection."
The mediating effect of response inhibition on the relationship between dieting preoccupation and impulsivity.,"['Kotwica, Zofia']","['Rooij, Daan van']",2023-09-06T23:00:47Z,EN,['impulsivity; diet; restrictive diet; response inhibition; stop-signal task; BIS; FFQ; RRS'],Applied Cognitive Psychology,"Current impulsiveness and disinhibition might be possible causes for constant dieting not being linked to weight loss, increasing impulsive eating, and making sustaining a desirable diet difficult. To explore this dependency and find potential tools for determining the risk of unhealthy food preoccupation, we investigated if inhibitory control abilities mediate the relationship between food preoccupation and impulsivity. The Stop-Signal Task (SST) was used as a measure of inhibitory control, the Revised Restraint Scale (RRS) and Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) measured dieting preoccupation, and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11 (BIS) measured impulsiveness levels among the adult participants. The regression analysis did not demonstrate significant correlations between any of the measures except for RRS and FFQ, and therefore the mediation of inhibition on impulsiveness and dieting preoccupation was not found. The findings suggest that low levels of food preoccupation might be necessary to sustain healthy eating behaviors."

Lacanian theory is used to analyze the worker's conundrums through 3 different fronts: ""Cultural Alterity"", ""Pro-social Fantasy"", and ""Neoliberal Subjectivation"". Based on psychosocial research methodology, this thesis unravels the unconscious dynamics and complexities in discourse through the use of ethnography, and semi-structured interviews. The findings underscore the complexities faced by workers in dealing with cultural alterity and in their endeavor to reconcile personal passion with pragmatic demands. The organization fosters strategies to assist the worker as they have to encounter systemic paradoxes in navigating the nuanced challenges inherent to migrant support."

Deze scholen zijn gebouwd in 1928, in een periode waarin Rotterdam werd uitgebreid op de zuidelijke maasoever. Tegelijk was dit een tijd waarin in Nederland steeds meer aandacht kwam voor stedenbouw, waarbij het Internationale Stedebouwcongres van 1924 in Amsterdam een belangrijke rol speelde.
Voor de uitbreiding van de stad werd een reeks uitbreidingsplannen opgesteld, waarbij het Uitbreidingsplan van W.G. Witteveen uit 1926 leidend was ten tijde van de bouw van de vier scholen. In dit uitbreidingsplan zijn verschillende principes zichtbaar die werden besproken op het Stedebouwcongres in Amsterdam, zoals het ruimte inplannen voor groen.
Van der Steur liet zich ook beïnvloeden door het destijds populaire cultuurfilosofische werk De ondergang van het Avondland van Oswald Spengler. Hierbij gaf Van der Steur een eigen, optimistische draai aan Spenglers ideeën.
Bij het ontwerpen van de scholen was het Bouwbesluit 1924 leidend. Dit was het meest recente uit een reeks bouwbesluiten, die scholenbouw reguleerden ten gunste van goede omstandigheden voor de kinderen. Bij veel regels was echter wel flexibiliteit ingebouwd en daarom had Van der Steur ook vrijheid om de vensters van de klaslokalen te oriënteren zoals dat het beste in het ontwerp paste.
In deze scriptie wordt geconcludeerd dat de invloed van het internationale stedenbouwkundige discours niet direct terug is te zien in het ontwerp van de scholen, hooguit indirect via de uitbreidingsplannen. Wel was Van der Steur op de hoogte van wat er speelde, maar het lijkt erop dat de stedenbouwkunde bij Van der Steur beperkt bleef tot een interesse die niet in de praktijk gebracht werd. Van der Steurs collega Witteveen was de stedenbouwkundige. Een onderwerp voor een verder onderzoek zou kunnen zijn wat de wisselwerking tussen Van der Steur en Witteveen inhield. Bovendien liggen er nog genoeg onderzoeksmogelijkheden wat betreft de invloed van Spengler op het stedenbouwkundige denken in de jaren 1920.""""]"

a reflection of historical exclusion of disabled individuals. And while research on visible disability-inclusion is
increasing, invisible disabilities -which are larger sources of drop-out and affect more students- are being left
behind. Moreover, the vast majority of the small number of studies on invisible disabilities at university, exclude
the perspective of the students themselves. Therefore this study answers the question ‘How do students with
invisible disabilities experience studying at Utrecht University?’. Visual-interviews, diary-interviews and focus
groups were applied to step into participants’ lived experiences. Results show that there are five important themes
within invisibly disabled students’ experiences: (1) the invisibility of their struggles and investments to actors at
university, (2) the stigma with which they are approached by actors within the university system, (3) the ableism
within the university system disabling them through rigid rules, schedules, tests and assignments, (4) the mindset
of individuality applied within the university, prohibiting them from reaching out for support and (5) an optimistic
idea about a trend towards more inclusion. Findings show a powerful neoliberal idea of being personally
responsible for ensuring optimal health and productivity, which decreases care-duties for organizations like
universities."

This adoption of an FFP is part of an international trend that started with Sweden in 2014. This thesis contributes to the growing body of literature on FFPs by exploring the Dutch FFP as a case study. It analyses the contexts and factors that have driven the process of the adoption and development of the Dutch FFP and the risks involved in this process. It demonstrates how feminists inside of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have used their position to advocate for feminist approaches and have taken on a leading role in the development of the FFP. Additionally, it finds that these feminist insiders are part of and supported by a larger feminist cooperative constellation with feminist experts and actors in civil society. The push for the Dutch FFP was made possible by the international context of an FFP trend, in which the Netherlands takes part to maintain its status and be seen as a norm entrepreneur. If the FFP merely functions as a label for this status, however, it risks playing into problematic gendered global hierarchies. If not undertaken in a reflexive manner, the Dutch FFP could therefore contribute to power imbalances rather than restoring them, thereby defeating its own purpose."

Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te achterhalen wat de rol is van kennis op de attitude van jongeren ten
aanzien van toekomstige klimaatverandering. Om dit te achterhalen, is gekeken naar de initiële attitude
van leerlingen uit de derde klas vwo t.a.v. toekomstige klimaatverandering, hoe deze leerlingen de
onzekerheden in de grafiek van het Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change interpreteren, in
hoeverre deze interpretatie te verklaren is aan de hand van hun voorkennis en initiële attitude en in
hoeverre het opdoen van kennis over de onzekerheden de attitude van leerlingen uit de derde klas vwo
t.a.v. toekomstige klimaatverandering verandert.

Om de onderzoeksvragen te beantwoorden zijn veertien leerlingen uit 3 vwo geïnterviewd. Voorafgaand
aan en na het interview vulden de leerlingen een enquête in om hun attitude t.a.v. toekomstige
klimaatverandering vast te leggen.

Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de leerlingen uit de derde klas vwo een positieve attitude t.a.v. toekomstige

wanneer het gaat om zorgen en angstgevoelens. Daarnaast blijkt dat de onzekerheden in de grafiek van
het Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change niet kunnen worden geïdentificeerd door de leerlingen.
Er zijn geen verbanden gevonden tussen de voorkennis, initiële attitude en de interpretatie van de
grafiek. Daarnaast blijkt dat het opdoen van kennis over onzekerheden t.a.v. toekomstige
klimaatverandering een positief effect heeft op het geloof in uitspraken van klimaatwetenschappers, het
geloof in maatregelen om toekomstige klimaatverandering tegen te gaan en de overtuiging dat de
overheid en grote bedrijven verantwoordelijk zijn voor het oplossen van de klimaatcrisis. Daarentegen
blijkt dat het opdoen van kennis over onzekerheden resulteert in meer zorgen bij de leerlingen.

Op basis hiervan wordt aanbevolen om transparanter te zijn over de onzekerheden en deze duidelijk te
communiceren. Daarnaast wordt het advies gegeven om ervoor te zorgen dat kennis wordt opgenomen
en verwerkt en dat de concentratie hoog blijft om ervoor te zorgen dat leerlingen de grafiek juist
interpreteren. Ook wordt aanbevolen een vervolgonderzoek te starten naar welke onderwijsmethode het
meest gewenste effect heeft op de attitude van jongeren t.a.v. toekomstige klimaatverandering. Hierbij

Dit onderzoek poogt een antwoord te vinden op de vraag hoe Twentse streektaalpoëzie tussen 1945 en 2020 reflecteert op industrialisering via verbeeldingen van het dorps- en plattelandsleven.
Om de onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden, is op basis van een nieuw Twents poëziecorpus, dat voor de doeleinden van dit onderzoek is samengesteld, een trefwoordanalyse uitgevoerd. Aan de hand van een woordenlijst is bepaald welke woorden van belang zijn voor de reflectie op industrialisering. De data zijn in afgebakende periodes (1945 tot 1973, 1974 tot 1991 en 1992 tot 2020) ingedeeld en geïnterpreteerd. Hierop volgde een kwalitatieve analyse van zes gedichten met close reading.
Het onderzoek toonde aan dat het trefwoordgebruik voor reflectie op industrialisering alleen in de derde periode iets afnam. Uit de kwalitatieve analyse kwamen geen andere aanwijzingen voort om bewijs te leveren voor die ontwikkeling. Daarnaast was het trefwoordgebruik in alle periodes veelal hetzelfde. Close reading bevestigde die waarneming en toonde verder aan dat Twentse dichters de verbeeldingen van het platteland vaak in contrast plaatsen met de industrie. Het sentiment van veel gedichten is negatief, maar in enkele gevallen ook positief. De conclusie is daarom dat de reflectie op industrialisering in Twentse streektaalpoëzie constant is tussen 1945 en 2020 en dat verbeeldingen van het dorps- en plattelandsleven worden ingezet om te contrasteren met de industrie als er negatief op de industrie wordt gereflecteerd."
New Treatment Opportunity for Acute Myeloid Leukemias Harbouring a UBTF Tandem Duplication,"['Mohnani, Rebecca']","['Heidenreich, Olaf']",2023-09-28T23:00:57Z,EN,[],"Cancer, Stem Cells and Developmental Biology","Tandem duplications in the upstream binding transcription factor (UBTF-TD) have been recently identified as a recurrent mutation in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). They are seen in 4% of de novo patients and 9% of relapse cases. Transcriptionally similar AML subtypes, such as MLL-rearranged, NUP98- rearranged, and NPMI-mutant AMLs, were found to respond to small molecular inhibitors to the menin-MLL1 interaction which is critical for leukemogenesis. We hypothesized that due to similarities in the oncogenic programs of these AML subtypes with AMLs harboring the UBTF-TD alteration, implementation of Menin inhibitors could lead to a reduction in the leukemic characteristic of UBTF-TD AMLs. This hypothesis was tested by treating primary UBTF-TD AML cells with the Menin inhibitor SNDX-5613 (Revumenib) and looking at its effect on global gene expression via RT-qPCR and RNA sequencing. Since UBTF-TD AMLs are often accompanied by FLT3-ITDs, we also looked at the effect of SNDX-5613 and its combination with an FLT3 inhibitor on this protein through phopho-STAT5 signaling pathway analysis. We found that Menin inhibition substantially changed global gene expression of UBTF-TD AMLs, including downregulation of important downstream target genes that depend upon the Menin-MLL interaction and upregulation of differentiation markers. Phospho-STAT5 signaling analyzed by flow cytometry revealed that individual treatment was as effective (Gilteritinib) or more effective (SNDX-5613) than combination treatment."
From Virtual Bullets to Real Brilliance: The effect of debriefing after VR firearm training,"['Hiwat, Thirza']","['Veltkamp, Remco']",2023-09-28T00:01:18Z,EN,['VR training; Debriefing; Self-debriefing; Group-debriefing; VR in education ; Adult education'],Human-Computer Interaction,"Virtual Reality (VR) is one of the key emerging technologies of this century and can be used in many domains. One of these domains is the education domain, where training in VR has become much more affordable due to the recent rise in the availability and affordability of consumer-grade VR equipment. Training in VR comes with many advantages such as an increase in motivation and an increase in self-efficacy. However, because of the novelty of VR, it is interesting to look into the implementation of the technology within a curriculum. It is important that the implemented VR module stays exciting and effective for the students using the technology. Debriefing is a facilitated phase that triggers reflective thinking after a simulation. Adding debriefing after simulation-based training is beneficial for students according to literature because they get a chance to examine their decision-making process and the consequences. Debriefing also increases performance scores.

The main objective of this research is to look into the effect of debriefing after VR firearm training at the Dutch Police Academy (PA) on knowledge gain, self-efficacy, motivation, and perceived usefulness. Furthermore, the research looks into what the best way of debriefing is for this specific case. The research uses VRange, a VR firearm training module for PA stu- dents, and The 3D Model of Debriefing, to conduct the experiment.

46 PA students participated in this study. The participants were divided into three groups; a no-debriefing (ND) group, a self-debriefing (SD) group, and a peer-to-peer (P2P) debrief- ing group. First, the students filled in a questionnaire, thereafter they would experience the VR training. The SD and P2P groups were debriefed after the VR training. The experiment ended with a post-questionnaire. All quantitative questions are based on existing question- naires. The pre-questionnaire measures the knowledge and self-efficacy levels before the VR training. The post-questionnaire measures the aforementioned variables plus motivation, perceived usefulness, and, the debriefing experience.

The results and discussion show that there are no significant results that indicate that the debriefing groups outperform the non-debriefed group for the self-efficacy, motivation, and perceived usefulness variables. Looking at the qualitative answers, the SD-group is more content with the debriefing session and the ND-group is most enthusiastic about the idea of debriefing, although they were not debriefed. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the implementation of VRange would benefit from the addition of debriefing because the effec- tiveness of adding debriefing cannot be proven by this research.

Although it cannot be concluded that the implementation of VRange would benefit from the addition of debriefing, some recommendations can be made. Debriefing can actually help students to be more reflective and students do see the benefit of debriefing. However, a module like VRange may not be the best educational tool for a debriefing. Another VR simulation, with less procedural knowledge, but where students need to make more choices could benefit more from the implementation of debriefing. If debriefing was to be used without a facilitator, self-debriefing would fit the Police Academy best. Because learners can track their progress individually and take it more seriously."

The use of fall-risk- increasing drugs (FRIDs) is one of the risk factors and deprescribing could therefore, hypothetically, reduce the risk of falls in older adults. Based on previous qualitative studies, shared decision-making (SDM) appears to be important in order to obtain effective deprescribing. However, this association has not yet been established using quantitative data. Therefore, this quantitative study aimed to investigate the influence of patient-reported SDM on the deprescribing of FRIDs in older adults. In addition, we were interested to see whether this effect differed between patients with and without polypharmacy.
Methods - A prospective cohort study was conducted using data from 31 patients visiting the falls or geriatric clinic of the Academic Medical Center of Amsterdam (AMC). To measure the degree of SDM, the iSHAREpatient questionnaire was used. Deprescribing was identified by using the letter corresponding to the consultation at the falls clinic which was stored in the medical software application of the hospital. Binary logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender and satisfaction with physician, was conducted to investigate the association between the mean patient-reported SDM score and deprescribing. In addition, an interaction term was created to analyze the potential moderator effect of polypharmacy.
Results - Binary logistic regression showed a significant association between overall patient-reported SDM and deprescribing (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.04 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-8.75]). Of the six dimensions of the iSHAREpatient questionnaire, choice awareness and deliberation also showed significant associations with deprescribing (aOR 2.16 [95% CI 1.04-4.46] and 2.44 [95% CI 1.05-5.70]; respectively). These associations did not significantly differ between patients with and without polypharmacy (P-value >0.1).
Conclusion - This study showed a significant association between higher mean patient-reported SDM scores and the possibility to deprescribe. Since this was the first quantitative study investigating this association with a relatively small study population, further research needs to establish these findings and their clinical relevance on, eventually, decreasing the risk of falls in older adults."
An Examination of Rodrigo Duterte's Rhetoric on the War on Drugs in the Philippines: The Apocalyptic Narration,"['Aishath Rumana Mahir, Rumana']","['Vukusic, I.']",2023-09-28T00:01:24Z,EN,['Extrajudicial killings; War on Drugs; Securitization; Apocalyptic Narrative; Existential Threat.'],Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"Rodrigo Duterte introduced a harsh anti-drug campaign based on hunting down drug users and distributors to eliminate the persistent drug problem in the Philippines. The campaign led to extrajudicial killings of drug users and distributors in the country without resorting to legal routes to justice. The justification was that the targets were extremely dangerous to the survival of the country. Thus, this research will explore how Duterte securitized drug users and distributors and legitimized the extrajudicial killings under the War on Drugs in the Philippines. It examines Duterte’s speeches from 2016 and 2017 to understand how Duterte framed the situation through narratives to legitimize the EJK. This research adopts the Securitization Framework to discuss the threat construction and legitimization process. Concurrently, it uses the concept of apocalyptic narration by Philip Smith. This research examines: the polarization of ‘good and evil’ and the exaggeration of the extend of the threat to construct an existential threat; and the presentation of Duterte himself as a ‘hero’ and ‘strong leader’ introducing a ‘miraculous’ solution to the drug problem. I argue that these narratives create an apocalyptic narration of events, securitizing the drug users and distributors, and legitimizing the extrajudicial killings. This research will explore the societal and cultural contextual elements constructing the narratives in Duterte’s discourses to induce fear and anxiety and inspire hope, thereby legitimizing the extrajudicial killings."
Doe-Het-Zelf Werkplaats Rotterdam. Performing urban citizenship through acts of solidarity and collective practices of repairing.,"['Godziuk, Paweł']","['Cremers, Gijs']",2023-09-28T00:01:19Z,EN,['Ethnography; Urban Anthropology; Citizenship Studies; Anthropology of Solidarity; Urban Citizenship; Repair; Collective Learning; Rotterdam; Squatting; Anarchism; Do-It-Yourself; Bicycle; Right to the city'],Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship,"This thesis, drawing on materials collected during ethnographic fieldwork in Doe-Het-Zelf Werkplaats in Rotterdam, explores the articulations and performances of urban citizenship through acts of solidarity and collective practices of repairing. By adopting the practice-oriented perspective, combined with the focus on solidarity and an epistemological inquiry into collective knowledge-making, this study provides a multi-angular account of urban citizenship, that contributes to the fields of urban anthropology, citizenship studies, and anthropology of solidarity. Urban citizenship, in this context, was conceptualized as a non-state-centric formulation that captures the multiple and overlapping ways in which people organize themselves in grassroots political communities, specifically embedded in an urban context, with aims at reshaping and governing their urban habitat."
Investigating the role of ADAM10 as a receptor for streptococcal pneumolysin,"['Nieuwschepen, Rinke']","['Spaan, A.N.']",2023-09-28T23:00:53Z,EN,['Streptococcus pneumoniae; pneumolysin; PLY; S. pneumoniae; A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 10; ADAM10; pore-forming toxin'],Infection and Immunity,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive extracellular opportunistic bacterium. S. pneumoniae mainly colonizes the human upper respiratory tract. Dissemination of this bacterium is a leading cause of a broad range of infections such as sepsis, otitis media, meningitis, and community-acquired pneumoniae. This bacterium produces pneumolysin (PLY), a cholesterol-dependent-cytotoxin. PLY mediates host cell death by binding to cholesterol in the plasma membrane and oligomerizing into cytolytic pores. PLY has been found to induce ADAM10-dependent E-cadherin cleavage, suggesting that the metalloprotease ADAM10 might be exploited as a receptor by PLY. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the role of ADAM-10 as a receptor for PLY. The surface expression of ADAM10 on multiple different epithelial and myeloid cell lines was measured. Lysis experiments with PLY were performed on these cell lines to study the sensitivity of cells in relation to their ADAM10 expression. Furthermore, the sensitivity of ADAM10-expressing rabbit erythrocytes and ADAM10-non-expressing human erythrocytes to PLY was compared. Lastly, ADAM10KO monoclonal cell lines were generated. Their sensitivity to PLY was measured and compared to the non-targeting control. ADAM10 surface expression did not correlate with cell sensitivity to PLY. Furthermore, rabbit and human erythrocytes demonstrated similar sensitivity to PLY. ADAM10KO cells did not demonstrate a physiologically relevant change in sensitivity to PLY. CONCLUSION: Our findings strongly indicate that ADAM10 is not utilized as a high-affinity proteinaceous receptor of PLY, as a lack of ADAM10 does not alter the cell sensitivty to PLY."
Exploring Interactive Experiences to Browse Extensive 360° Video Libraries in Virtual Reality,"['Knoop, Mike']","['Hürst, Wolfgang']",2023-09-28T23:01:44Z,EN,['Virtual Reality;VR; 360-degree Video; 360-degree Video Library; 360-degree Video Library Browsing'],Game and Media Technology,"The goal of this master’s thesis is to investigate the differences in experience and effectiveness
among various three-dimensional visualizations of extensive libraries to access 360° videos in virtual reality (VR) with head-mounted displays (HMDs). Currently, 360° video libraries are commonly accessed through a two-dimensional grid of thumbnails with an equirectangular representation of a subset of the library. This approach is inspired by the representation of digital video libraries on flat, two-dimensional screens. However, it fails to take advantage of the opportunities that immersive HMDs provide, such as larger display sizes and the ability to explore three-dimensional visualizations interactively. This study builds on previous work that revealed the advantages of using three-dimensional representations of individual 360° videos instead of the commonly used flat, equirectangular projections in terms of user experience and search performance. This is done by evaluating how these individual representations can best be visualized and explored in a three-dimensional environment with the aim of providing a pleasant and enjoyable browsing experience. Specifically, this study examines two layouts inspired by traditional physical stores (a video store and a record store) and one abstract representation inspired by movies. A comparative study involving nineteen participants revealed that the video store design had the best pragmatic quality, and the record store design had the best hedonic quality. Furthermore, the video store design was better ranked than the record store design. Moreover, participants performed better in the video store design when compared to the abstract store design. Interestingly, no significant differences were found between the three designs regarding perceived performance. These findings underscore the importance of user preference. Depending on whether the user wants an efficient experience or a more immersive experience, the best design shifts between the video store design and abstract store design."
