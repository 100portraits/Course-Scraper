Expected and experienced barriers for the implementation of sick day guidance in community pharmacies,"['Bas, Lotte van der']","['Bouvy, M.L.']",2023-07-22T00:01:40Z,EN,['SIDRIK; sick day; acute kidney injury; community pharmacies; implementation study; dehydration'],Farmacie,"Background 
Patients with impaired renal function are at increased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) during dehydration. Dehydration can occur during so called ‘sick days’ and or due to high environmental temperatures. In these situations certain medications should be adjusted as the risk for AKI is increased. Implementation of sick day guidance in primary care remains difficult.

Aim 
This study aimed to identify the expected and experienced barriers for the implementation of sick  day guidance in Dutch community pharmacies.

Method 
Semi-structured interviews with community pharmacists were performed to identify expected  barriers. The interviews were based on The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), and were conducted by three researchers, mostly in duos. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim using Amberscript. The coding was done in NVivo version 14. Experienced barriers were evaluated through monthly progress evaluations, which were performed by telephone.

Results 
A total of 24 pharmacies participated. Pharmacists mostly mentioned barriers associated with highworkload, staff shortages and recognition of sick days by pharmacy technicians. Additionally, the challenging communication with home care organisations, the limited trust of general practitioners  and patients in the pharmacists and the cognitive limitations of the patients were also noted. 

Conclusion 
This study identified multiple barriers that impede the implementation of sick day guidance in community pharmacies. These findings highlight the need for tailored implementation strategies focused on integration into existing work processes and involvement of pharmacist technicians and home care"
Panoramic Perspectives - Evaluating spatial widgets in immersive video through heuristic evaluation,"['Meijers, Max']","['Hürst, Wolfgang']",2023-07-22T00:01:35Z,EN,['virtual reality;VR;immersive video;spatial;navigation;interface;human-computer interaction;HCI;360-degree;heuristic evaluation;augmented reality;AR;volumetric video'],Game and Media Technology,"This research explores the value of spatial indicator widgets in
360-degree virtual reality (VR) videos to address the research ques-
tion of which spatial widget design, if any, is suited to adoption into
a user interface for VR 360-degree video playback. It proposes and
implements three designs for spatial widgets and compares their
effectiveness based on a heuristic study involving three experts.
The study found that spatial widgets offer welcome orientation aids,
especially in visually challenging environments, despite potential
issues with motor load and distraction. Among the evaluated de-
signs, the linear compass widget emerged as the most promising but
requires redesign for optimal functionality. The thesis concludes
that the inclusion of spatial navigation widgets in VR 360-degree
video players is a worthy consideration and suggests avenues for
future research, such as the integration of these widgets into emerg-
ing technologies like volumetric video and augmented reality. The
results of this research serve as a first step towards designing more
user-friendly VR video interfaces."
Automatic Sleep Assessment from Eye Cues in Videos of Strongly Occluded Preterm Infants,"['Horbach, Rowen']","['Poppe, Ronald']",2023-07-22T00:01:39Z,EN,[],Game and Media Technology,"Monitoring the sleep of preterm infants provides valuable insights. Preterm infants are often strongly occluded, while the eyes are generally visible. Eye cues play an important role in manual sleep assessment of preterm infants. We exploit this correlation in an attempt to fully automate sleep assessment with (low-end) RGB cameras. We propose a framework to consistently extract eye regions in videos of occluded preterm infants. We show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be trained on these regions to automatically identify eye states. We predict whether the eyes are opened or closed using a binary CNN, with a test accuracy of 96.3%. Using a sliding window and a binary 3D CNN, we also identify REMs, with a test accuracy up to 74.5%. We aggregate eye states per minute, and translate resulting features to sleep states with a random forest classifier. We manage to automatically discriminate sleep stages wake, active sleep and quiet sleep, with an accuracy of 92.2% - exclusively using eye cues. We discuss remaining issues and propose solutions to further improve the performance. Videos recorded at the neonatal intensive care unit of the University Medical Center Utrecht were used to construct labeled datasets."
Evaluating the League of Legends Tutorial Based on a Theoretical Skill Model,"['Grigorov, Nikola']","['Frommel, J.']",2023-07-22T00:01:32Z,EN,[],Game and Media Technology,"Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games have become extremely complex. Getting into them as a new player becomes a harder task every day as the amount of knowledge you would have to know and skills you have to possess in advance keeps growing. New player inexperience could lead to them being the target of abuse from other players since they will view their mistakes as bad plays. Modern methods such as chat detection or reporting systems, tend to focus on the perpetrator of toxic behaviour to reduce the negativity of online communications. I present a new approach to help decrease it. In this paper, I focus on bridging the skill gap between new players and veteran players by researching what it takes to play League of Legends optimally. Using an established skill model for esports games, I have applied it to League and have defined the skills that fit within the model. With the help of an online questionnaire, I asked veteran players to narrow down the most important skills within League. Based on their feedback and the skill model, I have evaluated how well the current League tutorial matches their expectations. This approach shows that the current tutorial introduces a skill gap between what is expected of new players to know and what they should know to play League optimally. Through optimizing the tutorial content based on this model I believe that the new player experience can be improved, the toxic behaviour towards new players can be alleviated and potentially this approach can be applied to other complex (MOBA) games"

The resulting networks are graded on 6 properties to determine if the approach produces results of sufficient quality."
"BERT, but Better: Improving Robustness
using Human Insights","['Pieke, Michael']","['Nguyen, Dong']",2023-07-22T00:01:48Z,EN,[],Artificial Intelligence,"Pre-trained transformers are highly effective across numerous Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks,
yet their ability to generalise to new domains remains a concern due to their tendency to rely on spurious
correlations. Consequently, this thesis investigates the impact of token-level human supervision to enhance
BERT's generalisation capabilities. Although the benefits of token-level insights have been shown to improve
the performance of these models, few studies have examined the effect of these insights to improve
generalisation. Consequently, this work explores the potential of human supervision to guide BERT's attention
mechanism towards salient features, thereby improving generalisation across domains. Results from
experiments in both binary and multi-label classification scenarios demonstrate not only substantial gains
in out-of-distribution (OOD) performance in few-shot contexts, but also a closer alignment between the
model's attention scores and salient features identified by human annotators. By emphasising the role of human
insight in transformer models, this thesis contributes to the ongoing discourse on enhancing performance
and explainability in NLP applications."

"Enhancing table discovery and similarity evaluation in
data lakes","['Díaz De Burgos Llaberia, Víctor']","['Velegrakis, Ioannis']",2023-07-25T00:02:24Z,EN,"['Dataset discovery, text processing, keyword extraction, word embeddings']",Applied Data Science,"The discovery of relevant tables within a data lake is a crucial task for users
seeking to expand their available data and gain deeper insights into specific
topics. In this thesis, we propose several approaches to address the
problem of table discovery using similarity metrics. Our main objective is
to find the most similar tables in a data lake to a given query table.
We begin by comparing the columns of the query table with those of the
candidate tables using Jaccard similarity. This pairwise comparison allows
us to compute their similarity score. It presents efficiency challenges due to
the extensive computational requirements. To overcome these limitations,
we investigate the use of keyword-based approaches. We propose using
the Yake and LDA algorithms to extract the keywords that best represent
the tables and determine the similarity score with weighted Jaccard similarity.
These keyword-based approaches yield comparable accuracy scores
to the column-based methods while offering improved efficiency. However,
comparing keywords works poorer when tables contain data about a
similar but not exact same topic. We transform the keywords into embeddings
usingWord2Vec and BERT to be able to analyse the semantics of the
words. The similarity score in this case is determined by the weighted cosine
similarity between the vectorized keywords. Furthermore, we evaluate
our models using the NDCG@10 evaluation metric, which assesses the
ranking of the top tables based on a labelled data lake we annotated. We
show that LDA combined with Word2Vec is the most efficient and accurate
model when tables contain sufficient natural language textual data.
In conclusion, our research presents a comprehensive exploration of table
discovery in data lakes, focusing on similarity-based approaches. We
provide insights into the efficiency and accuracy of various methods, emphasising
the use of keywords and embeddings for table comparison. Our
findings contribute to the broader field of data discovery and serve as a
foundation for future research in improving table discovery techniques."
Why Algorithmic Decision Making Is Not Value-Neutral: Proposing a taxonomy of values in algorithmic decision making,"['Biekart, Marijn']","['Klein, Dominik']",2023-07-25T00:02:26Z,EN,['Algorithmic decision making; value judgments; fair AI; philosophy of AI; ethics; risk profiling.'],Artificial Intelligence,"Algorithmic decision making (ADM) is used to assist decisions that have far-reaching consequences for individuals and society as a whole, for example in hiring and criminal law. As such, it is important that ADM is fair. It is commonly believed that ADM is objective and neutral, which supports its fairness. The first aim of this thesis is to show that ADM is not, and cannot be, objective or neutral. Instead, ADM necessarily contains value judgments. In order to prove the existence of values in ADM, this thesis uses arguments from the philosophy of science, that show that science is not value-free. The parallels and differences between science and ADM indicate that values play an even bigger role ADM, compared to science. The second aim of this thesis is to propose a taxonomy of values in ADM, which indicates where values play a role, what values play a role, and how they play a role. There are two main purposes of the taxonomy: (1) it can be used by developers and regulators to recognize the values that play a role in ADM systems, ideally resulting in less unintentional outcomes; (2) it can be used to regulate ADM by informing public sector policies and laws. The practical use of the taxonomy is demonstrated by a case study, focusing on Rotterdam’s welfare fraud detection system, which uses risk profiles to indicate which recipients have a higher risk of committing fraud. This thesis provides a deeper understanding of the relation between values, bias, and unfairness in ADM. By acknowledging that ADM cannot be value-neutral, this thesis shifts the focus from omitting bias to managing bias, in an effort to make ADM fairer for everyone."
A Matter of Interest: Academic Boredom and Mental Health Among European VET-students,"['Borkhuis, Eva']","['Coopmans, M.']",2023-07-26T14:00:36Z,EN,[],Youth Studies,"Previous research has demonstrated a rise in mental health issues among European adolescents, underlining the importance of gaining more insight into the mechanism behind this phenomenon. Among students, valuing their study (subjective value) or experiencing a sense of control over it (subjective control) has been associated with positive mental health. A lack of either has been associated with high levels of boredom during class (academic boredom). The extent to which academic boredom can explain the relationship between either subjective value or control and mental health has not been explored. The current study investigates this possibility with a cross-sectional design among European VET-students (n = 180), aged 15 to 19, since there is relatively little known about this population on the matter of mental health. An online questionnaire was distributed during their Civic Education (CE) course. As expected, a higher sense of value towards CE related to lower levels of academic boredom during CE, which in turn was associated with better mental health among students. No relations were found between CE-related subjective control and either academic boredom or mental health. Future research and interventions aimed at adolescent mental health must consider the role of academic boredom."
The contribution of buildings towards commitments within the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and derived policies in the Netherlands – opportunities and implementation gaps,"['Haan, Leanne']","['Frantzeskaki, Niki']",2023-07-25T00:02:20Z,EN,"['Governance, European Union, Biodiversity Strategy, Nature-based Solutions']",Bio Inspired Innovation,"As the world’s biodiversity continues to decline, the need for a system’s change is bigger than

of important sectors, such as the built environment. With the rise of different biodiversity enhancing 
strategies for buildings, the contribution of the built environment towards nature conservation holds 
great potential. In this review, we assess commitments within the European Union Biodiversity Strategy

identify missing links and implementation gaps. According to our analysis, the Biodiversity Strategy for 
2030 promotes these strategies sufficiently, but some missing links exist in Dutch polies and legislation. 
On the upside, we also discovered many action plans, initiatives and strategies in play that allow a 
promising future for biodiversity."

“Financing the Future: The Role of Investors in a Circular Economy in the Netherlands”,"['Schoon, Puck']","['Hendriks, Abe']",2023-07-25T00:02:32Z,EN,['Circular Economy; Financing; Transition Theory; Arenas of Development; Visions of change'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"This study explores the ideal role of financiers in a circular economy (CE) in the Netherlands by 2050. Achieving the ideal role of financiers in the CE requires collaborative efforts among government, financial, business, and knowledge actors. To investigate this, 15 interviews were conducted with experts in finance and CE.  
To achieve the desired transformation, changes across multiple levels, including individual, organizational, and societal levels are needed. Transition theories investigate distinct factors that contribute to both the resistance to change and the driving forces behind the transformation. The Arenas of Development (AoD) theory is derived from the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) and focuses on the networks and configurations of actors operating within specific arenas. The interviews reveal a consensus that within the Arenas of Development, the government actor world should act as enablers, inspiring innovation and adjusting regulations and legislation to promote circularity. Regulations should support, rather than hinder, financial and business actors, with pricing mechanisms like CO2 pricing incentivizing circular practices. The financial actor world, mentioned in the interviews, needs to communicate its needs to government actors to accelerate funding for circular practices and steer business actors using financial tools. Business actors are vital in signaling their needs to government and financial actors and should adopt circular principles at the core of their business models. They should promote a just distribution of benefits and collaborate within the supply chain. Knowledge actors should be more active in contact with the other actor worlds by providing education, expertise, and innovation to drive the transition toward circularity.  
Visions of change are essential elements within transition studies as they provide a shared understanding of the future and serve as a driving force for transformative processes. Achieving a CE that fosters prosperity, resilience, and resource productivity while minimizing waste, necessitates collaboration among multiple stakeholders, including government, financial, business, and knowledge actors. This expanded version of the triple helix model emphasizes the indispensable role of all actors alongside each other. By 2050, a thriving CE can be achieved through strong collaboration, knowledge sharing, and shared goals among government, financial, business, and knowledge actor worlds. This collaborative effort will drive the transition towards a sustainable and circular future, realizing the shared vision of a prosperous, resilient, and environmentally responsible Netherlands. It requires aligning actions and strategies with circular principles, adopting a systemic approach, and fostering collaboration across the value chain."
Hybrid streamflow modelling using machine learning and multi-model combination,"['Ali, Hassan']","['Karssenberg, Derek']",2023-07-25T00:02:22Z,EN,"['Global Hydrological models, machine learning, multi-model combination, streamflow prediction, Random Forest']",Applied Data Science,"Global hydrological models (GHMs) enable global estimation of freshwater availability, but 
their uncertainties and limitations hinder precise predictions. Multi-model combination (MMC) 
is a promising solution that combines the outputs of numerous hydrological models to create 
an ensembled output that surpasses the individual hydrological models. Moreover, the use of 
Machine Learning (ML) as a hybrid post-processing strategy is growing in popularity. 
However, there is a need to combine these two methods and investigate their performance in 
streamflow predictions. In this study, we demonstrate that using Random Forest (RF) as a nonlinear MMC approach significantly enhances streamflow forecasts when multiple global 
hydrological models' outputs are combined. In streamflow forecasting, the RF-MMC method 
outperforms individual models and linear MMC approaches, demonstrating its potential. In 
addition, incorporating catchment attributes improved the generalizability of the RF-MMC 
method when tested on a river basin that was not in the training set. Significant potential exists 
for the application of RF-MMC to generate accurate streamflow forecasts, thereby providing 
valuable support for water resource management, flood mitigation, and decision-making 
processes. Future research can investigate additional machine learning algorithms and 
incorporate additional variables to improve the predictive ability and generalizability of MMC

Hence, small towns also have a role in the development of regional growth. The driving factors that cause this are people's encouragement to achieve a decent livelihood and encouraging its residents to move up into more urbanized areas. In addition, the improving transportation network and industrial activities have also encouraged the emergence of this phenomenon. However, in the process, urbanization and urban growth are not always accompanied by well-balanced spatial planning practices such as strict monitoring and evaluation. This academic study explores the link between the Semarang, its hinterland, and its interaction with peri-urban areas, emphasizing the commonly overlooked debates and activities occurring in the peri-urban environment. This study investigates the impact of large-scale infrastructure projects in new economic corridors in Central Java on the rural-urban transformation process, as well as potential policy interventions to address associated challenges. The fundamental study issue focused on the function of the newly built economic corridor in Central Java and its influence on the physical and socioeconomic elements of the region's rural-urban change. This research examines the brief proposition that large-scale industrial estate development in this corridor encourages transformation by analyzing the transformation process across physical, socioeconomic, and policy aspects. The collected data will be processed using quantitative descriptive analysis, LQ analysis, and supported by GIS analysis. The findings of this study are that in the economic corridor of Central Java, there is a rural-urban transformation process that is still running where the impact affects physical, social, and economic conditions and spatial policies that regulate the space. Hence, these findings intend to provide insights into the dynamic interrelations between the corridor's growth and the region's physical, socioeconomic, and environmental features. With the results provided, this study is expected to contribute to the discourses of economic development, especially in the role of small towns in the context of developing countries whose development comes from foreign investment and major infrastructure projects."
The influence of psychological mechanisms and buildings' bioclimatic conditions on occupant behaviour,"['Clohse, Anne-Jil']","['Venema, Tina']",2023-07-28T01:01:24Z,EN,['bioclimatic architecture; occupant behaviour; built environment; behavioural studies; sustainable development'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Introduction. The building sector is responsible for about 40% of total energy usage in the European Union, of which 60% can be attributed to residential building energy consumption. Further, the gap that persists between predicted and actual energy consumption of buildings presents an issue for investors. This gap can be partly explained by occupant behaviour not being considered when estimating energy performance of buildings. Hence, this research investigates the influence of bioclimatic conditions, habits, and moral licensing on occupant behaviour.
Theoretical background. Bioclimatic architecture, habits, and moral licensing are the theoretical foundations of this research. Bioclimatic architecture refers to a sustainable way of designing buildings that considers the local environmental context of the building (e.g., bioclimatic conditions such as the orientation of a building, solar radiation, or ambient temperature). Habits are unconscious behaviour that is triggered by environmental cues and plays an essential role in energy consumption. Moral licensing describes the cognitive process in which humans justify acting morally wrong without feeling guilt by having acted morally right previously. It is a cause of rebound effect.
Methodology. To research the influence of bioclimatic conditions, habits and moral licensing on occupant behaviour, a quantitative cross-sectional research design was chosen. Data is collected through a survey questionnaire (N = 545) and supplemented by archival data. Further, data is analysed through multiple linear regression.
Results. The results show 7% of occupant behaviour is explained by certain bioclimatic conditions, while 17% is explained by psychological mechanisms. In terms of psychological mechanisms, habits have a larger relative influence on energy-consuming behaviour than moral licensing. Lastly, psychological mechanisms can predict occupant behaviour to a larger extent than bioclimatic conditions.
Discussion. The effect of bioclimatic conditions on occupant behaviour was weaker than expected. A potential explanation for this is the small size and the lacking variety in climatic conditions within the Netherlands. Although some limitations to the research were identified, it presents the first attempt at predicting energy consuming behaviour through bioclimatic conditions of residential buildings and psychological mechanisms which can guide future research.
Conclusion. The findings of this research added to the knowledge on energy-consuming behaviour and how it is influenced. Architects, energy consultants for the built environment and policy makers can all include the insights of this research to help bridge the gap between predicted and actual energy consumption of buildings."
Environmental and technological advantages and disadvantages of Floating Photovoltaics in the Netherlands,"['Obbink, Yasmin']","['Mirbagheri Golroodbari, Sara']",2023-07-28T01:01:31Z,EN,[],Energy Science,"The increasing energy demands, fast depletion of fossil fuels and the need to decarbonise are encouraging the rapid deployment of renewable energy in the Netherlands. A promising new technology to assist in this regard is Floating Photovoltaics (FPV), which can be deployed in both inland waters (freshwater FPV) and at sea (offshore FPV). However, since this is a new technology, there is limited knowledge about its technological performance and environmental impact. Nonetheless, it is important to have more knowledge order to eventually implement these technologies on a large scale. Hence, the objective of this research is to enhance our understanding of the technological performance and environmental impact of FPV systems in the Netherlands.
The technological performance of FPV systems was evaluated by comparing the energy yield, cell temperature and windspeed of a Land Based PV (LBPV), freshwater FPV and offshore FPV system. The environmental performance was assessed by examining the impact of the FPV system on water quality and ecology, specifically on the phytoplankton, macro-invertebrates, and fish. Additionally, the interaction between the FPV system, weather conditions, and environmental impacts was examined. 
Previous studies on freshwater FPV were mainly based on assumptions and models. In order to validate or improve these assumptions and models, a case study was conducted for this research, evaluating data on the technological performance and environmental impact of a freshwater FPV system. When data was not available, it was supplemented with literature research. No data was available for offshore FPV. Consequently, a literature review was conducted, supplemented by semi-structured interviews.
From the results becomes clear that the technological performance of freshwater FPV is higher than the performance of a land based system. The main challenge for freshwater FPV is to minimize harmful effects on the environment related to the effects of the decreased light availability under the platform. At a depth of 1 meter, the light intensity beneath the FPV system is reduced by 25%, resulting in decreased algae growth below the system. The reduced light indirectly correlates with lower oxygen levels beneath the panels, creating less favourable conditions for fish and other aquatic life. This issue is particularly pronounced in December when the oxygen concentration in lakes is naturally low.
The main challenge in offshore FPV is to enhance system design to ensure reliability and economic viable system in the future. If successful, offshore FPV is expected to have a higher energy yield than land based systems, can be implemented on a larger scale compared to freshwater FPV and has less risks for the environment. 
This study revealed that both freshwater FPV and offshore FPV can contribute to the Netherlands climate objectives. However, to enable their broader implementation, further development of both technologies is necessary."

Vervolgens is deze ontwikkeling van de betalingsbereidheid voor de energieprestatie van woningen gecorreleerd met de ontwikkeling van de energiekosten. De analyse laat een sterk verband zien tussen deze twee factoren, zoals blijkt uit een Pearson correlatiecoëfficiënt r van 0,678 met een driekwart vertraging. Deze correlatieanalyse bevestigt dat er inderdaad een verband is tussen de betalingsbereidheid voor energieprestaties en de schommelingen in energiekosten."

However, parenting strategies that are encouraged in interventions worldwide, are often derived from Western communities, with the risk of ignoring local needs and violating ethical codes. Crucial for parenting intervention development is research into local models of childrearing, which can be done by consulting local experts. For this reason, this study investigated parenting perceptions by consulting local experts in two different countries: India and Uganda. Moreover, this study aimed to provide suggestions for future intervention development. The ideal-parent beliefs approach (Lin et al., 2022) and the Parent Development Theory (Mowder, 2005) served as conceptual frameworks for this research. Respondents for this study were five Indian and five Ugandan experts working for Help a Child (Dutch NGO) in the areas of community work and parenting. The results of this study were collected through semi-structured interviews. This study showed that in both India and Uganda parents are the most important caregivers. Further the focus of parents is mainly on meeting the basic needs of children. Only in Uganda this comprises education as well. Parents in both countries exhibit little responsivity and sensitivity towards their children. In both countries the roles of fathers and mothers are separated. Lastly, Ugandan parents are more actively working towards a better future for their children than Indian parents. Recommendations for future intervention development and follow-up research are provided."

contribute to better word reading and higher reading motivation in grade 1, so parents and 
educators should work together in order to find the most effective way to stimulate children’s 
reading motivation and reading skills."
An ex-durante evaluation of the effect of the buy-up protection on square meter prices and rents in Rotterdam,"['Welkers, Ruben']","['Basta, Claudia']",2023-07-28T01:01:34Z,EN,['Buy-up protection; buy-to-let; Rotterdam; web scraping; difference-in-difference analysis'],Spatial Planning,"This thesis features an analysis towards the effect of the buy-up protection on housing
unaffordability in Rotterdam. As housing was becoming more unaffordable during the
2020’s, the municipality of Rotterdam has implemented the buy-up protection in 16 of its
71 neighbourhoods on the first of January 2022. In this research, the effect of the buy-up
protection on housing unaffordability was analysed through a Difference-in-Difference
analysis of the average square meter price and rents in Rotterdam. From this analysis, it
becomes clear that the buy-up protection was able to prevent the average square meter price
of housing in buy-up protection neighbourhoods from being € 29,22 (±1%) higher than if the
buy-up protection was not implemented. However, this analysis also shows that the buy-up
protection was responsible for a € 0,80 (±5%) increase in the average square meter monthly
rent in buy-up protection neighbourhoods. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the results of
this research should not be viewed in isolation. The effects of the buy-up protection on square
meter prices/rents are a singular factor within a larger framework of possible effects of the
buy-up protection."

This research explored how tutors experience the tutor-student relationship within the HDT-setting, by conducting 12 qualitative semi-structured interviews and 19 unstructured observations, with 12 participants. Results indicate that the tutor-student relationship is an important but diverse aspect of High Dosage Tutoring. Key components to a positive relationship are related to closeness, highlighting knowing students well and creating an open atmosphere. Socio-emotional components can also influence the tutor-student relationship, as well as how tutors perceive the role of sociocultural background. These results implicate more attention is needed for the role of sociocultural background and how this impacts the tutor-student relationship within HDT interventions. Future research should longitudinally assess tutoring relationships to grasp the causal relationship between tutor-student relationships, sociocultural background, and socio-emotional outcomes. Moreover,
HDT should be studied in different contexts, to further understand the ecological context of the tutor-student relationship."

Overruling of the urgency allocation by triage nurses in males and females with symptoms suspected of transient ischemic attack or stroke in out-of-hours primary care,"['Engelen, Ruth']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-08-02T23:00:48Z,EN,['Out-of-hours primary care; Netherlands Triage Standard; telephone triage; overrulen; urgency; transient ischemic attack; stroke'],Geneeskunde,"Abstract:
Background:  During out-of-hours, primary care is provided by the out-of-hours service primary care (OHS-PC) in the Netherlands. For patients with symptoms suspected of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke most often first the OHS-PC is contacted during out-of-hours, not directly 112. In the OHS-PC a semi-automatic decision tool, the Netherlands Triage Standard (NTS), is used to generate an urgency allocation which is linked to a time frame within which medical care should be delivered, all based on the estimated severity of symptoms by the triage nurse. However, a triage nurse can overrule the urgency level given by the NTS by upgrading or downgrading it. 
Aim: To identify the relation between overruling of the NTS urgency by the triage nurse and eventual diagnosis of TIA or stroke in males and females who call the OHS-PC for symptoms suspected of TIA or stroke.  

Methods: This study was executed in nine OHS-PC locations around Utrecht, the Netherlands between 2014 and 2016. Information was collected on call characteristics and urgency allocation at the OHS-PC, and the general practitioner (GP) was asked to provide the final diagnosis. The direction and frequency was calculated of overrulement of the urgency level generated by the NTS. Accuracy of the NTS urgency and final urgency (including overruled cases) against the final outcome TIA or stroke was given by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value. The association between overruling and (i) the final urgency and (ii) the final diagnosis TIA or stroke was calculated with univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Statistically significance was considered with a p-value <0.05.

Results: Of the 1,955 patients, 732 (37.4%) had a TIA or stroke. 368 (18.8%) calls were overruled, mostly to a higher urgency (70.0% upgrading, 30.0% downgrading), with more often upgrading in males than females (77.9% vs. 62.3% p = 0.996). High urgency generated by NTS compared to presence or absence of TIA/stroke had a sensitivity of 0.69, specificity of 0.45, a positive predictive value of 0.59 and a negative predictive value of 0.56. These relations were for the final urgency: sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.38, positive predictive value 0.58 and  negative predictive value 0.58. There was no significant effect of overruling the NTS on the final diagnosis of TIA or stroke.

Conclusion: Triage nurses overruled the NTS urgency level in nearly one out of five patients calling the OHS-PC for neurological deficit symptoms. They most often upgraded the urgency level, and overruled more males than females. Overruling of the NTS, however did not improve the accuracy of detecting or excluding TIA or stroke."
Decreased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 in the hippocampus in response to tumours in a mouse model of breast cancer,"['Bovekamp, Lisanne van de']","['Bodegraven, Emma van']",2023-08-03T00:00:41Z,EN,['Cancer-related cognitive impairment; Cancer-induced cognitive impairment; cytokines; pro-inflammatory; anti-inflammatory; mammary tumour; tumour microenvironment; mice study; sickness response; IL-4 decrease; hippocampus; IL-10 decrease'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Many cancer survivors, even years after treatment, struggle with cognitive impairment. These people have difficulties with short-term memory, organisational skills, problem-solving and learning and retaining information. When people have cancer, the body starts an inflammatory response which can reach the brain and trigger these symptoms. In this study, we wanted to see if we could predict if this person is at risk of developing cognitive impairment with a tumour biopsy. To test this, we looked at gene expression levels of inflammatory markers in the tumour and the hippocampus. The hippocampus is the brain region most likely to be affected in people with the symptoms of cognitive impairment. We injected mice with cancer cells in breast tissue, and after 19 days, we took the tumour and hippocampus to measure gene expression. We found that the tumour makes pro-inflammatory immune molecules that help them grow. However, we did not observe increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines when we examined the hippocampus. Interestingly, we found that these mice made less of the anti-inflammatory molecule IL-4 compared to mice without tumours. This may make the brain less capable of protecting itself against pro-inflammatory molecules. We also measured the size of the tumour and the spleen. The spleen can grow in size if the body is experiencing high levels of inflammation. We found that with a bigger tumour, the spleen is also bigger. This suggests that a bigger tumour creates a higher inflammatory response. We also found that with bigger tumours and bigger spleens, the gene expression of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 is lowered in the hippocampus but higher in the tumour. Thus, based on these findings, the anti-inflammatory molecules could be more informative in predicting or treating cancer-related cognitive impairment instead of the more commonly looked at pro-inflammatory molecules. This research provides insights into the complex relationship between cancer, inflammation, and cognitive impairment. While inflammation in the tumour microenvironment is present, the impact on brain inflammation and cognitive function is not straightforward. Further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets for managing cognitive impairment in cancer patients."
What's the Buzz about Nature Based Enterprises? Examining the the role of Nature-Based Enterprises in Urban Beekeeping for Urban Sustainability Transitions,"['Dumont de Chassart, Gabrielle']","['Avelino, Flor']",2023-08-03T00:00:39Z,EN,"['Nature-Based Solutions; Nature-Based Enterprises, Urban Sustainability Transitions; Urban Beekeeping']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Research problem and aim: Nature-based solutions have emerged as promising strategies for urban sustainability transitions, however, there remains a lack of clear understanding around crucial actors needed to implement them. One such actor is nature-based enterprises. Academic understanding of nature-based enterprises is still in the early stages, with limited insights thus far from the global south and industry sectors. Whilst collaboration is recognised as an enabling feature of both nature- based enterprises and urban sustainability transitions, these research fields have not been combined to date. To address these research gaps, this thesis focuses on urban beekeeping to investigate how nature-based enterprises collaborate and contribute to urban sustainability transitions. This research aims to raise awareness of nature-based enterprises and provide insights into their potential roles in urban sustainability transitions.
Theory: This research combines literature on nature-based enterprises, collaboration and urban sustainability transitions to inform the conceptual framework. The framework defines nature-based enterprises in terms of key partners, value proposition, and activities. Furthermore, five mechanisms (replicating, partnering, upscaling, instrumentalizing, and embedding) are identified to better understand their contributions to urban sustainability transitions.
Methodology: A qualitative embedded multiple-case research design is employed. The design focuses on the beekeeping sector in Harare and Amsterdam as case studies. Over the course of the research 22 interviews were conducted in total with NBEs, urban beekeeping organisations, key partners, and academic experts. Interviews were supplemented with document reviews and participant observation. A thematic coding strategy was employed to analyse the data.
Results: Harare and Amsterdam cases are presented according to operationalized empirical research questions on nature-based enterprises, collaboration, and urban sustainability transitions. Discussion/Conclusion: Upon comparison of case results, findings suggest nature-based enterprises
composition and capacity for diverse partnerships, positioning them at the crux of contemporary sustainability challenges. The study identifies five key roles nature-based enterprises can undertake to do so, namely: Context-Specific Educator, Hybrid Upscaler, NBS Provisioner, NBS Coordinator, and Corporate NBS Delivery. This heuristic framework contributes to literature by illuminating ways nature-based enterprises can mobilize and collaborate to contribute to urban sustainability transitions. Alongside academic relevance, the findings hold practical importance for nature-based enterprises seeking to further leverage their platforms for urban sustainability transitions."
"Women's Work: Making Sense of Energy Poverty through Gendered Social Practices in Kanaleneiland, Utrecht","['Beukema, Tess']","['Hoffman, Jesse']",2023-08-03T01:01:00Z,EN,"['energy poverty, gender, social practice theory, energy practices, utrecht']",Sustainable Development,"In 2022, over half of Dutch households have difficulties paying their general expenses and 602.000
households (7.4% of the total) are estimated to live in energy poverty. Energy poverty – a term
popularised in the 1990s – is traditionally characterised as a combination of low incomes, high energy
bills and poor quality housing (Boardman, 1991). While official definitions do not (yet) exist, many
define it as the inability of households to attain sufficient energy services in the home. In line with
perspectives which view ‘energy’ as part of realising social practices (Shove & Walker, 2014), ‘energy
services’ refer to space heating (or cooling), cooking, ICTs or the efficiency of domestic white goods.
Poor energetic housing conditions due to a lack of insulation or poor maintenance are uncomfortable,
but can also be detrimental to physical and/or mental well-being. However, current energy poverty
approaches do not (yet) address the highly gendered dimensions of the phenomenon which make
women more vulnerable to energy poverty than men. Herein, ‘gender’ intersects with other mutually
coexisting personal factors such as age, socio-economic position, health status, and migrationbackground. Using a social practice approach, this qualitative study makes use of ethnographic
fieldwork, (in)formal interviews, and participatory action research (PAR) to study how energy poverty
is understood and acted upon through gendered energy practices in Kanaleneiland, Utrecht.
Kanaleneiland is a neighbourhood in Utrecht, the Netherlands, with a significant social housing stock,
large migrant population, and widespread income poverty problems. This study showcases how a
gendered practices perspective can reveal the higher likelihood of women experiencing energy
poverty and their role in acting upon it at home. Findings indicate that by association with femininity,
low-technical solutions to energy poverty are placed in the female domain, while masculinity is
attached to financial or technical strategies. Due to cultural differences and language barriers,
informal networks and active citizens were found to be crucial in knowledge transfer and sharing. The
disproportionate impacts and responsibilities carried by women make energy poverty a distinct
gender inequality problem. To ensure a more inclusive energy transition, recognition of women’s
distinctive energy-user experiences, cultural sensitivity through (in)formal networks, and
acknowledgement of the structural and systematic inequalities underlying energy poverty is
recommended."
The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on inter-European maritime and aviation trade flows,"['Pattikawa, Mayro']","['Hernández Rodríguez, Eduardo']",2023-08-01T00:02:56Z,EN,"['Covid-19, bilateral trade, transport mode, maritime transport, aviation transport, Gravity Model, Network Analysis, Covid-19 deaths, restriction stringency, China dependency, inter-European']",Human Geography,"This study examined the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on inter-European maritime and aviation trade flows. It focused on changes in bilateral trade flows between pre-Covid-19 and post-Covid-19 periods, as well as testing the significance of the effects between Covid-19 and these trade flows divided by transport mode. This research used a combination of network analysis and a gravity model of trade to uncover and visualize changes in the trade networks and determine the extent to which Covid-19 influenced bilateral trade flows. The results showed changes in both maritime and aviation trade. Maritime trade experienced a decrease in connectivity and trading volumes, while aviation trade saw a decrease in connectivity but increased trading volumes. The gravity model analysis confirmed that gross domestic product (GDP) and distance were key factors influencing maritime and aviation trade flows, with higher GDP associated with increased trade and greater distances leading to decreased trade. The study also explored the influence of Covid-19 proxied by the number of Covid-19 deaths, the stringency of Covid-19 restrictions, and the pre-Covid-19 China dependency ratio on maritime and aviation trade. The findings revealed a significant negative relationship between the number of Covid-19 deaths in the destination country and maritime trade and a negative relationship between the number of Covid-19 deaths in the origin country and aviation trade. Stringency in Covid-19 restrictions did not significantly influence trade flows, and a higher pre-Covid-19 China dependency ratio negatively affected maritime trade in the destination country and aviation trade in both the origin and destination countries. This research contributes to understanding the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on inter-European trade, the varying trade effects of different transport modes, and confirms the importance of economic factors and geographic proximity in shaping trade patterns."
Insight Into Sparse Autonomous Seismic Acquisition With Compressive Sensing and Gradients,"['Almalki, Badr']","['Pires de Vasconcelos, Ivan']",2023-08-01T00:02:52Z,EN,['Autonomous Seismic Acquisition; Compressive Sensing; Gradients'],Earth Structure and Dynamics,"Technological advancements in different scientific fields may allow seismic acquisition to be fully autonomous. Due to the high cost, it is still not plausible for this technology to be used. Autonomous marine seismic acquisition requires many expensive platforms and vessels to acquire high-quality seismic data. A straightforward way to reduce the cost of such seismic surveys is by using fewer platforms. However, this will result in acquiring fewer traces due to the spatial under-sampling caused by using fewer sources and receivers. This project aims to revisit new developments in compressive sensing techniques to handle missing data by reconstruction from sparse seismic data. Using data from both field and numerical settings, we looked into the role of wavefield gradients in recovering missing data from highly subsampled observations. This included experimentation with subsampling, different sparsity-promoting solvers, and the role of transformation of data to different sparse domains. The reconstruction of different datasets with their gradients using compressive sensing techniques showed promising results for regularly subsampled data. For the randomly subsampled data, the results were not as promising since the F-K domain is not an ideal sparse domain for such data."

underlying features for predicting T cell phenotypes (Treg or Tconv) and T cell population
dynamics. These features were investigated using a random forest classifier, clustering and
using the Bray-Curtis statistic. Non-overlapping TCR sequences from a reference dataset were
used to train and validate the random forest model, but the predictions were not
significantly better than random, indicating that the TiRP score and its underlying features
are insufficient to act as a definitive classifier. Afterwards, hierarchical clustering was
employed to investigate Tregness patterns in the Emerson dataset based on various features
such as age, gender, CMV status, and race, but no clear patterns emerged. Additionally,
Bray-Curtis (BC) similarity scores between the Emerson dataset and reference datasets were
calculated, showing equally high dissimilarity compared to Treg and Tconv populations,
indicating that the BC scores were non-informative on the nature of the donor T cell
repertoire. In addition, the BC scores did not exhibit significant changes with age or gender.
Overall, the TiRP score proved inadequate for population dynamics and classifier models due
to overlapping TCR, low diversity and the inherent noise in the scoring."

Using aggression can lead to problems in daily life, but also has implications for future chances. In existing literature, the use of aggression has often been explained by individual factors. However, there is also evidence for predictors of aggression in the context of the child, such as parental characteristics. This study examined the relation between experienced maternal emotional support and adolescents’ aggressive behavior, and whether this relation is mediated by the empathic capacity of the adolescents. Data was collected from 492 adolescents (age 13-14, 56,6% girls and 43,1% boys) from the large RADAR project. Adolescents were asked to complete questionnaires assessing the perceived emotional support from mother, their level of empathy and aggressive behavior. To analyze the data PROCESS was used. The main findings showed that perceived emotional support from mother was a predictor of adolescents’ level of empathy and adolescents’ use of aggression. An association was found between adolescents’ level of empathy and adolescents’ use of aggression. This study found complete mediation between the researched variables.

It is thought that joint attentional interactions during infancy and vocabulary development support ToM, but these have rarely been investigated together during preschool age. This study therefore aimed to examine the importance of both language and joint attention for ToM in preschoolers. It was expected that better joint attention and vocabulary together as well as individually predict better ToM abilities. Consequently, the results can broaden knowledge on risk factors and protective factors for social cognitive development during early childhood. 
	The sample consisted of 63 Dutch preschoolers between the ages of 3 and 5 years old. They were assessed on their joint attentional abilities, their vocabulary and ToM skills through the use of the Early Sociocognitive Battery (ESB), the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III-NL) and the ToM-test. Results show that better joint attention and vocabulary jointly predict better ToM comprehension. However, further analysis reveals that only vocabulary comes forward as a significant predictor of ToM. No evidence was found for joint attention as a predictor for ToM. Possibly, the way joint attention as well as ToM were operationalized could have limited the results. In conclusion, acquiring vocabulary is an important development for ToM comprehension in preschoolers. Suggestions for future research regarding this topic are made."

However, the results did not provide any evidence supporting a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms among pill users compared to non-users (t = 0.197, p = 0.844). Therefore, the first hypothesis that oral contraceptive use affects depressive symptoms could not be confirmed. These findings differ from previous studies involving adult women (Gingnell et al., 2013; Lindberg et al., 2012; Skovlund et al., 2016; Wiréhn et al., 2010), suggesting that the effect may vary across different age groups. Moreover, no evidence was found to suggest that the duration of oral contraceptive use influences depressive symptoms (t = 0.792, p = 0.430). A possible explanation for these findings is that many women discontinue pill use within a year (Keyes et al., 2013). However, this information was not available in the collected data. Despite valuable insights, this study has limitations, including a smaller sample size due to missing values and oversampling of adolescents at an increased risk of delinquent behavior.

It is important to conduct research on ToM in the preschool age, as this period is characterized as a critical period for ToM development. In addition, existing research is mainly limited to languages other than the Dutch language. Two tests were administered to 63 children. Receptive vocabulary was measured with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III-NL). ToM was measured with the Dutch translated Theory of Mind Battery (ToM Battery). A stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed. In line with expectations, receptive vocabulary is a significant predictor of ToM, after controlling for age and multilingualism. So this means: the larger the receptive vocabulary, the higher the level of ToM. This relationship appears to be generalizable. Contrary to expectations, gender is not a significant predictor of ToM. A gender difference may arise in preadolescence, with girls possibly performing better on ToM tasks than boys.

Over the past 10 years, reading proficiency in the Netherlands has declined. Approximately 50% of students in mainstream primary education and 7% of students in special primary education fail to reach the enhanced level of reading. Therefore, it is important to investigate the predictive value of the accumulation of risk factors, known as cumulative risk, on the reading proficiency of children in grades 5 and 6. Reading proficiency was assessed using the Cito test for Reading comprehension in grade 5 (n =336) and grade 6 (n = 236). Cumulative risk was measured using a cumulative risk checklist completed by teachers. The study aimed to examine the predictive value of cumulative risk on the reading comprehension skills of children in grade 5. A simple regression analyses revealed a weak, negative, and significant association between cumulative risk and reading comprehension skills of children in grade 5. Additionally, the influence of risk accumulation over time was examined after controlling for prior reading comprehension performance. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed no significant predictive value of risk accumulation over time. In contrast, it showed a strong and significance predictive value of reading achievement in grade 5 on reading achievement in grade 6. Finally, the interaction between accumulative risk and reading comprehension achievement in grade 5 was investigated, moderated by gender. Utilizing Hayes ’PROCESS-model, gender was found not to moderate the association between risk accumulation and reading comprehension. Providing good reading instruction appears to be an important factor in counteracting declining reading achievement."

This pilot study concerns a clinical population of children in care at Koraal, a treatment center for youth with (mild) intellectual disorders, behavior-, and/or psychiatric disorders. When a negative relation is found, the results may contribute to further development of treatment focused on Trauma-Informed Care. Method: A survey and case file study of children aged 5 to 25 years (N = 32) was conducted, for who the number of experienced ACEs and resilience were determined. The data were analyzed through multiple regression analysis. Results: No significant moderation was found for gender or out-of-home placement in the relationship between ACEs and resilience. Actually, the relationship between ACEs and resilience was found to be insignificant. However, a significant gender difference was found in the mean number of ACEs, with girls having experienced more ACEs than boys. Discussion: This study shows that boys and girls in clinical groups seem to differ in the number of ACEs they experienced. No relationship with resilience was found, this may be the result of low power (data were collected during COVID-19). It is also possible that the complexity and impact of out-of- home placement could explain the lack of a significant effect. Overall, these results highlight the importance for further research into different factors that may contribute to a child’s resilience after experiencing ACEs."

De Invloed van TOS en/of Thuistaal op Spelling,"['Vries, Laura de']","['Bree, Elise de']",2023-08-10T00:01:16Z,NL,['Developmental Language Disorder; Spelling; Multilingualism'],"Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Children with a developmental language disorder (DLD) have serious language problems that affect their daily lives and functioning. The group of children with DLD is very heterogeneous. Many children with DLD also have literacy problems in the form of reading and spelling problems. Relatively little is known about the literacy of multilingual children with TOS, so this study investigated whether multilingualism plays a role in the spelling skills of children with TOS. In addition, the effect of part of speech (pure sound, rule words and knowledge words) in word spelling was investigated, as well as the relationship between a word dictation and a writing task. A dictation and a writing task were administered to the same sample of 139 and 167, respectively, monolingual and multilingual children with DLD from cluster 2 schools. Analyses show that there are no differences between monolingual and multilingual children with DLD on both the dictation and the writing task, and that there is a strong correlation between the dictation and the writing task. The findings show that children with DLD in cluster 2 education have difficulties with word- and text spelling, but also that multilingual children with DLD have no more difficulties than monolingual children with DLD in this sample."
The aural world of Christian heritage at the Catharijneconvent: Gospel. Muzikale reis van kracht en hoop (Gospel. Musical journey of strength and hope) exhibition. María Luisa Guevara Tirado.

Muzikale reis van kracht en hoop (Gospel. Musical journey of strength and hope), held between the 30th of September 2022 and the 10th of April 2023. Music has a place in museums now, as demonstrated by popular music exhibitions and sound art. Yet, the debate continues. Should sound be in a museum? Multi-sensoriality, inclusivity, and participation have changed how museums operate and present content to the public. In 2003, UNESCO recognized music as Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH). Music and musical instruments are semantic fields with status and meaning. Songs are cultural artefacts; they reflect the value and beliefs of the culture that produced them. Thus, songs preserve, transmit cultural heritage, and represent societal changes related to politics and economics. The Catharijneconvent, the national museum for art and Christianity in The Netherlands, became the first museum in the country to make an exhibition on gospel music. Why now? Why here? What is the reason behind this decision? This study aims to demonstrate that the Catharijneconvent's approach to incorporating music as a curatorial theme renewed Christian heritage, providing an exploration of an aural world via songs.
The data collection at the exhibition involved gathering information through qualitative research. The theoretical framework involved: art history, musicology, sociology, popular music studies, museum studies, and interviews with the different members of the exhibition team, the curator Rianneke van der Houwen, Willem Driebergen, the audiovisual advisor and research assistant, the designer Wiegert Ambagts from the design studio Namelok, based in Rotterdam; the sound designer and Professor Sara Lenzi from the University of Delft; the American curator Tyree-Boyd-Pates, who was responsible for the exhibition How Sweet: Gospel in Los Angeles at the California African American Museum (CAAM). Gospel. Muzikale reis was subjected to an extensive analysis, resulting in a theorization.
As more non-musical museums adopt popular music exhibitions, caring for rethinking their ocular-centric displays and integrating listening practices beyond using audio guides, it is clear that music as a curatorial theme has a potential yet to be explored. Therefore, the study case of Gospel. Muzikale reis van kracht en hoop presented an opportunity to evaluate the importance of cultural artefacts, such as songs, and their
impact as a strategy to make sense of the aural world of Evangelism, renewing the art historical discourse."

In this retrospective cohort study collected data used for diagnostics of 197 HS patients referred to University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMCU, the Netherlands) was used to study genotype-to-phenotype correlations in HS. From the included haematological parameters, Laser assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyzer (LoRRca MaxSis) Osmoscan profiles and other diagnostic tests, the parameters red blood cell distribution width (RDW; r= 0.692, P= 0.000), maximal elongation index (EImax; r=-0.559, P= 0.000) and eosin-5’-maleimide assay (EMA; r=-0.433, P= 0.000) appeared to be the best predictors of clinical severity, respectively. Genetic analysis has identified a causative genetic defect for 185/197 (93.3%) of the patients included. With disease severity classified according to Eber’s classification system (1990), no direct relationship between genotype and clinical severity could be detected (χ2, P= 0.054). Nevertheless, both haematological parameters and Osmoscan parameters -correlated to disease severity though not included in this classification system- imply that SPTB-HS patients have a predominantly more severe clinical picture and SLC4A1-HS patients are generally less severely affected. Apart from the exploration of genotype-to-phenotype correlations in this cohort, a side study was performed on the carriers of Low Expression alleles Lyon (αLELY) and PRAgue (αLEPRA) to gain insight on the pathogenicity and inheritance patterns of these alleles. Finally, a first step has been taken in characterizing the subpopulation of HS patients showing distinctively different, non-classical, Osmoscan profiles identifiable by an increased Ohyper, and here defined as overhydrated HS."

The framework incorporates a decision model that utilizes the MoSCoW requirements prioritization technique and Weighted Sum Model for computational purposes. This enables organizations to effectively prioritize requirements based on their relative importance in facilitating the achievement of successful multi-cloud adoption. The framework allows organizations to identify and prioritize the most suitable CSPs by leveraging multiple features and assigning higher priority to critical requirements. A systematic literature review was conducted to establish a comprehensive understanding of the multi-cloud domain, encompassing adoption, selection, migration techniques, and relevant features and providers, which were further validated through consultations with domain experts. Through an iterative process, the decision model was developed and validated using three case studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in assisting organizations in selecting a suitable multi-cloud environment and evaluating the compatibility of their existing setups. While the decision model provides a best-match suggestion, organizations should conduct further analysis and address specific contractual issues with the selected CSPs to ensure a proper fit. Consequently, the decision model serves as an initial guide, providing a shortlist of CSPs that warrant closer examination by the organization. Additionally, the collection of multi-cloud environment features, derived from domain expert insights, systematic literature review, and document analysis, contributes to a comprehensive overview of the multi-cloud domain, offering valuable insights for addressing future challenges."
Mushroom Production in the Circular Economy,"['Ciaglo, Max']","['Krijgsheld, Pauline']",2023-08-11T00:01:27Z,EN,"['Mushrooms, Oyster mushrooms, Fungi, Circular economy, Waste streams']",Bio Inspired Innovation,"Global food production is unsustainable and relies on agricultural practices that are linear and create abundant waste. Mushrooms, especially oyster mushrooms from the genus Pleurotus, produce enzymes that 
can break down lignocellulose in these wastes and upcycle them into edible mushrooms. However, current 
research is insufficient. Most studies only report mushroom growth based on typical substrate recipes using 
local waste and weakly correlate their results to the essential nutrients of the substrates like cellulose, lignin, 
and nitrogen (mostly from protein). While this does demonstrate that mushroom production on waste is 
possible, it makes it difficult for small-scale mushroom producers to translate these results to a different 
context where that waste stream is not available. Additionally, most studies are conducted in a lab setting 
where some data (e.g. infection rate) is not considered relevant, although it is a critical element of commercial mushroom production. To close these gaps, this research took a two-step approach, focused on 
the common commercial grey oyster (Pleurotus ostreatus) and king oyster (Pleurotus eryngii) mushrooms. 
First, a literature analysis was conducted to generalize findings from relevant studies that investigated 
mushroom production on various waste streams. Biological efficiency and the essential nutrients in the substrate were standardized across all the studies if possible. Second, experimental research was performed at a 
small-scale commercial mushroom production company in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Here a variety of agricultural and urban waste stream were used to produce both species of mushrooms. Biological parameters 
of mushroom growth including infection rate, mycelial colonization time, fruiting time, and biological efficiency were then reported. The effects that the essential nutrients in the substrate have on these biological 
parameters (from literature and experiments) were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. Overall, 
the amount of cellulose and lignin, but not nitrogen, in the substrate had the most effect on mushroom 
growth. More cellulose and less lignin apparently increased the biological efficiency of both mushroom 
species according to the literature analysis. However, in the experimental part of this research more cellulose increased infection rates for P. eryngii, possibly masking the effect of cellulose on mushroom growth, 
although it did appear that increased lignin decreased biological efficiency for this species. Experimentally, 
for P. ostreatus, cellulose had the opposite effect and decreased biological efficiency, possibly due to the 
strain that was used. Future research should focus on reducing infection rates and increasing the cellulose 
component of substrates to see if results from the literature can be replicated. Overall, this research adds 
to current evidence that these mushrooms can be effectively used to upcycle waste streams and close the 
loop in a circular economy."

A sketch consists of sketch rules that indicate how the environment has to change in a particular situation to reach the goal. Using sketches effectively speeds up the search for a solution to a planning problem. While a previous technique for learning sketches has been investigated, this thesis proposes a novel, modular approach to automatically find all `good' sketches with n rules and m features given a set of domain instances with similar goals. Our approach involves lazily generating a pool of potential sketches and verifying them using temporal logic constraints. We show that our method can find good sketches for eight domains, including those learned in previous research. Because our approach allows us to generate all good sketches with a certain number of rules, we can analyze patterns of equivalent sketches, which opens up a wide range of future work."

Method: A total of 286 files of juveniles with a supervision order (in Dutch ondertoezichtstelling or OTS) aged 0-18 years were assessed by dichotomously coding the variables ‘child’s externalizing problem behavior’, ‘child maltreatment’, ‘parental intellectual disability’ and ‘out-of-home placement’ using scoring forms. Results: The results of the multiple logistic regression analysis showed that child’s externalizing problem behavior and parental intellectual disability are significant explanatory variables for out-of-home placement. Child maltreatment is not a significant explanatory variable for out-of-home placement. Moreover, the results of the moderation analysis showed a significant interaction effect between child’s externalizing problem behavior and parental intellectual disability on out-of-home placement which means that a child with externalizing problem behavior has a higher risk of being placed out-of-home when parents have an intellectual disability. There is no significant interaction effect for child maltreatment and parental intellectual disability on out-of-home placement. Discussion: In conclusion, to prevent or shorten out-of-home placements as much as possible, prevention and intervention programs should specifically target children with externalizing problem behavior and parents with an intellectual disability. An intervention program which can prevent out-of-home placements is intensive outpatient family treatment (in Dutch intensieve ambulante gezinsbehandeling). Limitations and implications are discussed."

The right care will be predicted using regular care data which includes blood measurements, previous patient appointments, and referral letters. These referral letters will be text mined. The goal is to classify patients early, to prevent expensive scans. Only patients who have been referred to the cardiology department with chest pain symptoms will be considered. Patients are given one or more classes, making this a multi-label classification problem. Time series data will be constructed using patients' history, and models using time series data will be compared to models that cannot. As time series models, the LSTM model will be used and compared to the T-LSTM. The addition of target replication to both models is researched. As non-time series models, the XGBoost, SVM, and Neural Network models will be used. After creating labels using available data, the number of labels is reduced from 30 to 9 using a novel label combination algorithm. Additionally, subgroup discovery is performed, which was able to find a group based on one rule with an accuracy of 73%. Overall, the time-aware LSTM does not perform better than the vanilla LSTM. The time-series model outperforms the non-time-series models. Target replication only gives a performance increase for the vanilla LSTM. The best-performing model, the LSTM with target replication, has a micro F1 score of 0.62 and an AUC of 0.84. Performance might be limited by the fact that labels had to be constructed from scratch."

we need a program that is properly split into several tasks that can be performed in parallel. High level
frameworks like Accelerate make it easier to create such programs. Accelerate creates programs using
data parallel array computations. For more parallelism we propose a way to automatically add task
parallelism to programs as part of the Accelerate compiler. We define a transformation to introduce forks
to a program. We formalize this transformation using inference rules and we implement it in the Accelerate
compiler. To reduce the overhead of the added task parallelism, we propose several optimizations to not
introduce forks where they do not introduce actual opportunities of added parallelism, like not forking
trivial statements and combining statements that directly wait on the result of the previous statement.
Our results show that the compilation of this implementation is not significantly slower than the current
Accelerate compiler."
De weg naar een beweegvriendelijk park,"['Prinsen, Annika']","['Visser, Kirsten']",2023-08-18T00:01:04Z,NL,['beweging; actieve mobiliteit; recreatief bewegen; sportief bewegen; openbare ruimte; parken; beweegarmoede; bewegingsstimulering; bewegingsbevordering; beweeggedrag; randvoorwaarden; veiligheid; urban green space'],Human Geography,"Het belang van bewegen op de mentale en fysieke gezondheid is vandaag de dag algemeen bekend. Toch voldoet meer dan de helft van de Nederlanders niet aan de beweegrichtlijnen. Om deze trend te doorbreken en gebruik te maken van de opkomende trend waarbij ongeorganiseerd sporten populairder wordt, is nu het momentum aangebroken om parken in te gaan zetten om beweging te faciliteren en stimuleren. Niet alleen aanwezigheid van parken is van belang, maar ook de inrichting ervan is namelijk cruciaal. In dit onderzoek is daarom met behulp van de ruimtelijke triade en het ‘Beweegvriendelijke omgevingsmodel’ ingezoomd op hoe een park functioneert als ‘beweegvriendelijk’. Dit houdt in dat er wordt onderzocht hoe recreatieve beweging, sportieve beweging en actieve mobiliteit worden nagestreefd in het park, hoe het park voor beweging wordt gebruikt en hoe het wordt beleefd. Daarbij zijn voor elk type beweging directe en indirecte factoren onderscheiden die van invloed zijn op de beweegvriendelijkheid ervan. Dit is onderzocht aan de hand van een casus in Amersfoort, het Waterwingebied.

Allereerst is met behulp van een beleidsanalyse van het park onderzocht hoe beweegvriendelijkheid is beoogd in het park. Omdat het enige beleid verouderd is en uit 2009 stamt, is de beleidsanalyse aangevuld met interviews met beleidsmedewerkers die zich richten op beweging in het park. Hieruit blijkt dat hoofdzakelijk recreatieve vormen van bewegen worden gefaciliteerd en gestimuleerd maar dat een toename van sportieve beweging en actieve mobiliteit daar impliciet onder kan vallen. Er zijn in de beleidsplannen een aantal directe factoren zoals een padennetwerk aangestipt evenals indirecte factoren zoals het bevorderen van gevoelens van sociale veiligheid, ten behoeve van recreatieve beweging. Deze factoren kunnen van impliciete invloed zijn op sportieve beweging en actieve mobiliteit. Daarna is door middel van observaties in kaart gebracht voor welke typen beweging het park gebruikt wordt, waaruit blijkt dat recreatieve beweging het meeste voorkomt. Ook is in kaart gebracht wie het park gebruikt en waar zij bewegen. Tot slot zijn gebruikers geïnterviewd om te achterhalen hoe het park wordt beleefd rondom beweegvriendelijkheid. Dit gaf inzichten in hoe bepaalde elementen worden beleefd, wat verdieping heeft geboden op de uitkomsten van de eerste twee deelvragen. Hierdoor konden verbanden worden gelegd waardoor goede en slecht functionerende beweegvriendelijke factoren zijn gedetecteerd namelijk de grasvelden, de verharde paden en gebieden waar een aanlijn- en opruimplicht geldt. De beweegvriendelijke elementen die toepasbaar zijn op alle typen beweging zijn de routes & paden, het beheer & onderhoud, sociale veiligheid, fysieke veiligheid, connectiviteit, de infrastructuur en esthetiek. Tot slot is duidelijk geworden dat beweegvriendelijkheid voor het ene type beweging, niet per definitie beweegvriendelijk is voor een ander type beweging en dat persoonlijke voorkeuren een grote rol speelt in beleving en daarmee beweegvriendelijkheid."

that occur when different groups interact. It is especially important to address the changes
within the higher education setting, as the population of international students is increasing
rapidly. With this empirical study of intergroup communication between Dutch and
international students, we aimed to investigate how factors such as group status and perceived
intergroup threat relate to psychological and physiological stress responses. The study was
designed in the form of framed intergroup discussion between two participants belonging to
different status groups (Dutch students as the high-status group versus international students
as the low-status group), with the topic proposing benefit of the low-status group at the
expense of high-status group. Self-report anxiety and heart rate measures were taken as
indicators of stress. Additionally perceived intergroup threat was assessed. We found no
significant differences between the status groups on either of the stress response measures,
although the heart rate increased significantly on the overall sample during the discussion
compared to baseline. However, we were not able to conclude whether this was indeed an
indication of stress. Our key finding was that low-status group members scored significantly
higher on perceived intergroup threat, despite the discussion putting them in a better position.
This suggests that intergroup threat might be more influenced by the general experiences,
which raises concerns regarding psychological safety of international students and calls for
further investigation into the reasons behind our findings."

During the entire year 2022 five scatterometer instruments on MetOp-B, MetOp-C, HY-2B, HY-2C and HY-2D satellites were operational at the same time. Taking advantage of this opportunity, this thesis conducts an analysis of the differences in surface wind divergence between observations from the available satellites and the operational IFS model of ECMWF. In addition, comparison between observations of different scatterometers are performed. The analyses focus on the North Atlantic and the Tropical Atlantic regions, where two important phenomena for the surface wind divergence can be found: the Gulf Stream and the ITCZ. 
Overall, ASCAT observations show more variability and a higher proportion of extreme wind divergence values in comparison with HSCAT. This is particularly noticeable in the ITCZ and Gulf Stream regions, where convergence extremes are more prevalent. 
These study’s findings indicate that the operational ECMWF model exhibits a greater bias in wind divergence when compared to the ASCAT satellites (MetOp-B and MetOp-C) than with HSCAT satellites (HY-2B, HY-2C and HY-2D). Particularly, on the Tropical Atlantic, significant bias is found on the ITCZ area with ASCAT and HSCAT instruments for the winter and summer months of 2022.
Furthermore, the results reveal more consistency between MetOp-B and MetOp-C observations over the Tropical Atlantic than over the North Atlantic. However, the model biases perceived by ASCAT and HSCAT satellites is greater over the Tropical Atlantic than over the North Atlantic. In consequence, it demonstrates that the operational ECMWF model presents a greater bias on the Tropical Atlantic."

Research often focuses on the role of parenting aspects when understanding emotion self-regulation among toddlers. The present study aimed at investigating the association between parental beliefs about emotion talk and toddlers’ emotion self-regulation, and the mediating role of parents’ emotion talk (N = 75). Beliefs about emotion talk were measured using the Parent’s Belief About Feelings Questionnaire (PBAF), whereas emotion self-regulation was assessed via the Infant-Toddler Symptom Checklist (ITSC). Furthermore, parents’ emotion talk was measured using the “Elk Plaatje een Praatje” online task. Results showed that parents who hold more positive beliefs regarding emotion talk were more likely to use emotion words in their discourse with their child and had toddlers with better emotion self-regulation. Surprisingly, parents who employed emotion words more frequently did not have toddlers with better emotion self-regulation. Finally, no mediating role of parents’ emotion talk was found. Parental aspects of emotion socialization, including emotion-related beliefs seem to play a prominent role in the development of toddlers’ emotional competence, and may thus be targeted within prevention and intervention parenting programs. However, the interaction between these various aspects appears to be more complex than expected. Untangling how different aspects of parent-child dynamics work to enhance or hinder the development of emotion regulation in toddlerhood is an important step towards a better understanding of the field."

This study expands the scientific literature on Workplace Fomo, Private Social Media Use, Burnout, and Work Engagement. A total of 273 participants aged 18-35 who worked at least 12 hours a week were included in this study. As expected, a positive association between Workplace Fomo and Private Social Media Use is found. Additionally, in line with our expectations Private Social Media Use had a positive influence on Burnout. However, contrary to expectations Private Social Media Use positively predicted Work Engagement. Finally, the effect of Workplace Fomo on Burnout and Work Engagement was not predicted by Private Social Media Use. Contrary to initial expectations, Private Social Media Use was found not to play a mediating role in the relationship between Workplace Fomo and Burnout and Work Engagement. Future research should focus on finding other mediating variables or factors in the relationship between Workplace Fomo and Work Engagement. Future researchers should note that Private Social Media Use may mediate a more specific relationship, such as between Fomo and burnout from social media use. A theoretical implication is that this study contributes to academia by being the first study that analyzes the meditative effect of Private Social Media Use on the relationship between Workplace Fomo and Burnout as well as Work Engagement.

Stimulation of grid-aware electric vehicle charging,"['Prevaes, Max']","['Sark, Wilfried van']",2023-08-18T00:00:50Z,EN,['Smart Charging; Vehicle-to-Grid; Linear Programming; hour-based electricity prices'],Energy Science,"While the expanding electric vehicle (EV) fleet shows great environmental advantages, it also creates an increase in electricity demand that is causing pressures on the electricity grid. The concept of controlled charging, i.e. coordinating the moment and capacity of EV charging, has the potential to reduce or mitigate these pressures, especially when charging is constraint to the physical and technical boundaries of the electricity grid. This concept is known as grid-aware charging. While there are several studies that focus on applying controlled charging for grid provision, the literature is lacking a study that focusses on stimulating these grid-charging services. This study aims to fill this gap with the following research question:

How can the adoption of grid-aware charging strategies be stimulated in the Netherlands?

To answer this research question, desk research is performed to identify typical Dutch driving profiles, Linear Programming models are proposed that coordinate charging based on price, using on hourly electricity prices, to minimize charging costs, a quantitative analysis is performed to identify the influence of the driving behavior on these profiles and costs, and nine expert interviews are conducted to identify concrete roles and tasks for involved stakeholders to stimulate grid-aware charging. 

The results show that charging costs reductions for a delayed, smart, and V2G strategy are 37%, 62%, and 137%, respectively. All three controlled charging profiles show significant peak reductions in electricity extraction in the evening, and charge during hours where the electricity prices are lower, i.e. night, morning, and afternoon. The V2G strategy discharges the battery during the evening. It was observed that mileage has a linear effect on the absolute charging costs but does not strongly influence average charging costs. Furthermore, the height and volatility of electricity prices influence both charging costs and discharging profits. The expert interviews show that for a successful scale up of grid-aware charging, market parties should function as aggregator, coordinating the charging for consumers. Governments should focus on stimulating the market, creating market boundaries, and creating consumers awareness on the advantages of grid-aware charging. Furthermore, transparent collaboration based between the market, DSO, and government is crucial for the effective stimulation of grid-aware charging in the Netherlands. 

The proposed LP model contributes to the body of literature that simulates charging behavior based on a minimization of costs. Further research could focus on the environmental benefits of the proposed charging profiles by the increased consumption of renewable electricity."

The Role of Indirect Contact in Reducing Binegativity,"['Weijdert, Eva']","['Oosterwegel, Annerieke']",2023-08-17T00:01:52Z,EN,['Binegativity; bisexuality; indirect contact; tolerance; vicarious contact; multicultural education; inner dialogue.'],Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"Sexual minorities, including bisexual individuals, are at higher risk of experiencing negative sexual identity outcomes and mental health problems due to the stressors associated with sexual identity-related stigma and discrimination. Bisexual people face unique challenges, such as dual-sourced stigmatization, stereotypes, and limited media representation. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of three types of indirect contact in reducing binegativity: online multicultural education, vicarious contact, and imagining internal dialogue. The research question is about whether these forms of indirect contact can reduce binegativity, and if there are differences in their effectiveness. It is hypothesized that all three interventions will reduce binegativity, with imagining internal dialogue being most effective. The study will employ a pretest/posttest design with four groups: three experimental conditions for each type of indirect contact and a control group. Data is collected from 222 participants aged 16-25 of Dutch origin through online questionnaires distributed via various platforms. The measurements will assess binegativity using a combination of the Attitudes Regarding Bisexuality Scale (ARBS) and the Transgender Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs Scale (T-KAB). The study aims to contribute to the development of interventions that reduce binegativity and promote the well-being of bisexual individuals. By understanding the potential benefits of indirect contact, efforts can be made to combat prejudice and increase positive attitudes towards bisexual individuals."
"Possible influence of microplastic on the partitioning and bioavailability of 17α-ethinylestradiol in agricultural

MPs may function as a novel 
compartment for the partitioning of chemical pollutants, thereby altering their 
bioavailability. 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a potent endocrine disruptor compound, enters
soil via biosolid application. Limited literature about influenced partition of EE2 in soil due to 
the presence of MPs is available. This research aims to assess the distribution of EE2 in soil in 
the presence of MPs for the plastic types of polyethylene (PE), polyamide (PA) and 
thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) in different environmental compartments using mass 
balance modelling, based on recent literature.

Generally, EE2 was found to be majorly bound to soil, except for low values of partitioning of 
EE2 in soil, while high amounts PA MPs were present. Concluding, specific polymers in high 
concentrations present, may influence the distribution of EE2 in soils co-contaminated with 
MPs. The observed sorption order (PA> PE > TPU) differed from expectations based on
literature. Combined effects of differences in crystallinity and strength of hydrogen bonds of 
PA possibly outweighs the difference in hydrophobic capacities between PA and PE. The 
observed concentrations of EE2 distributed in various compartments are not expected to 
show any adverse effects, based on the PNECwater. Also, less EE2 was taken up by biota in the 
presence of a higher plastic mass, so the presence of MPs may reduce bioavailability of EE2.

However, this model does not adequately reflect real-life scenarios due to assumption made 
and the nature of the parameters. Nevertheless, it provides a rough estimate of EE2 
partitioning in soil in the presence of MPs and highlights the lack of knowledge about toxicity 
of EE2 on soil organisms and the complexity of this matter. Follow-up research should focus 
on identifying partition values for EE2, for the variety of MPs and their degree of weathering 
found in soil. Additionally, trustworthy toxicity data is needed for accurate risk assessment."
"A NOVEL PERSPECTIVE: EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN SELF-CONTROL AND GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR. A sequential mediation model.","['Pap, Lisa']","['Vermue, M.']",2023-08-29T00:00:53Z,EN,[],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","This research is done as an extension of Gillebaart & Kroese’s research about selfcontrol, behavioral resistance and goal-directed behavior (2020). Their research concluded 
that people with high self-control feel less resistance to performing goal-directed behavior. 
This means that they are not necessarily better at inhibiting impulses or effortfully initiating 
unpleasant activities, but they appraise them in a different way. The current research 
introduces the regulatory focus theory as a potential mediator in this relationship. The 
expectation is that experienced behavioral resistance in high/low trait self-control individuals 
when performing goal-directed behaviors, such as healthy eating and exercise behavior, can 
be explained by having a promotion focused orientation. A cross-sectional study was
conducted in which participants reported their level of self-control, regulatory focus, 
behavioral and actual healthy eating and exercise behavior. A double mediation analysis was 
performed in PROCESS (Hayes, 2012). Surprisingly, findings show that both for healthy 
eating and exercise behavior, the relationship between self-control and goal-directed behavior 
is not mediated by promotion focused orientation. Furthermore, a negative relationship 
between self-control and promotion focused orientation and behavioral resistance and both 
goal-directed behaviors exists. The lack of significant results may be attributed to limitations 
such as inadequate reliability of the RFQ and the assessment methodology employed. The 
predominance of students within the sample might have also influenced the outcomes 
warranting caution in generalizing the findings. Future research should replicate these 
findings to gain more knowledge about the relationship between self-control and behavioral 
resistance with promotion focused orientation as a potential mediator."

This pilot study explored the potential relationship between psychosomatic symptoms, proprioception and body ownership in the general population. Method: Forty-nine participants underwent a proprioceptive localization task and the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI), with somatic symptom severity assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) and the Somatic Symptom Disorder-B Criteria Scale (SSD-12). Results: Our study revealed successful RHI induction but no significant correlations between somatic symptom severity and proprioceptive task performance. However, a positive correlation emerged between PHQ-15 scores and the VAS difference during the asynchronous RHI, indicating that individuals with more psychosomatic symptoms felt stronger ownership over the rubber hand in the asynchronous condition. Additional analysis showed differences in proprioceptive localization between left-right and near-far dimensions, with better accuracy in the former. Discussion: Though most participants scored low on the PHQ-15 and SSD-12, findings offer promising insights into the interplay of psychosomatic symptoms, body ownership and proprioception. Sensory suggestibility may influence rubber hand ownership in those with higher psychosomatic symptom scores. Further investigation of the differences in the asynchronous RHI condition may enhance understanding of body experiences in SSD and related disorders. This study provides preliminary data for future research on psychosomatic symptoms, proprioception, and body ownership. Larger and more diverse samples are needed to validate and expand on these findings. Exploring the complexities of these relationships offers valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying SSD and related conditions."

against perceived job insecurity","['Verwaijen, Gijs']","['Hoogenboom, Marcel']",2023-09-06T09:39:20Z,EN,[],"Social Challenges, Policies and Interventions","The rise of non-standard jobs in Europe is believed to subject a growing amount of employees 
to increasing job and social insecurity, which in turn can harm their health. The European 
Union addresses this issue through adult education programs, but their overall effectiveness 
remains uncertain. This research examined the impact of labour market flexibility, in the form 
of the proportion of temporary employment and employment protection, on cognitive and 
affective perceived job insecurity. It also investigated whether adult education participation 
(AEP) moderates this relationship. Utilising a cross-country multilevel regression analysis
with data from 16 European Member states (N =9226), it was found that a higher proportion 
of temporary employment predicts higher cognitive perceived job insecurity, but did not 
predict higher affective perceived job insecurity. Employment protection did not predict either 
form of perceived job insecurity. No evidence of moderation through AEP was found, 
although AEP independently predicted lower cognitive and affective perceived job insecurity. 
This aligns with existing literature suggesting a Matthew's effect in adult learning 
programmes and questioning its current ability to protect vulnerable employees on the labour 
market. It is recommended to improve data collection on the topic, do further research on the 
relationship between both cognitive and affective perceived job insecurity and employee 
health, and investigate what barriers vulnerable people on the labour market experience in 
participating in adult education and how they can be motivated and enabled to do so. With 
this additional research, policy-making can be informed in order to achieve labour markets 
that can maintain flexible while also offering sufficient protection against social insecurity to 
their employees, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes."
Role of place-of-residence in Provincial and Water Board elections,"['Bukman, Doris']","['Buskens, Vincent']",2023-09-06T09:39:36Z,EN,[],Applied Data Science,"Voting behavior is partly determined by candidate characteristics, one of which is place of residence. 
The friends-and-neighbors voting hypothesis posits that contenders for office garner disproportionally 
more support from voters in their hometowns. Voters are more likely to know of or know the candidate 
personally, they may believe that native candidates will defend their interests better, or they become 
mobilized through a sense of shared identity. While the bulk of the literature is focused on national 
elections in majoritarian systems such as the US or UK, this thesis project will investigate the role of 
the hometown advantage for the Dutch Provincial (Provinciale Staten) and Water Board (Waterschaps) 
elections. Specifically, it will research whether candidates receive more votes in the voting stations 
located in their places of residence in either election. These elections are second-order, conducted on 
the Provincial level, meaning that voters have a lower interest in and awareness of them than in the
national elections. As voters seek out less information about candidates’ merits and stances, they may 
rely more heavily on characteristics such as background to make political decisions. The Dutch elections 
are especially suitable for such research, as candidates’ place of residence is reported on the ballot, 
meaning that this information is easily available. 
Because of the excess presence of zero-values, the analysis is split into a two-part model to 
investigate firstly what determines whether or not a candidate receives any votes in either election and 
secondly how the number of votes is influenced. I find that candidates do receive significantly more 
votes in voting stations located in their hometowns and that this effect is quite large and consistent 
between the models. Candidates who are the only ones from a certain town running on their party’s 
ballot receive another vote boost. Furthermore, it appears that this effect is slightly stronger in more 
rural areas, where community ties tend to be stronger. The roles of wealth and candidate list position on 
the same-town residence effect remain largely unclear. Similarly, there are no clear convincing 
differences in the main predictor between either election. Overall, this research offers support for the 
friends-and-neighbors voting hypothesis in the context of the Dutch Provincial and Water Board 
elections."

Edge-definition techniques in cell-graphs play a fundamental role in graph-based learning, as they encode the interaction between the tumours’ cells that can be crucial for capturing complex histopathological patterns. These patterns, when accurately identified, can provide valuable insights into tumour structure and potential malignancy, therefore enhancing the precision of cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
The potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is further explored within this context. Recognizing the diversity and complexity of brain tumours, we leveraged the flexibility and extensibility of the GraphGym framework in our method, which allowed for a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to brain tumour classification. The resultant framework is used to evaluate both the performance of edge-definition approaches and the effectiveness of different GNN architectures.
The objective is to identify the most effective combination for brain tumour classification. The results of this study aim to provide significant insights and make a substantial contribution to the advancement of diagnostic accuracy in neuro-oncology."

As expected, we founded a direct effect physical attractiveness on dating interest, indicating that a high level of perceived attractiveness predicted more dating interest. Promising new results revealed that self-transcendence values, expressed in a life quote, predicted a higher dating interest than self-enhancement values, expressed in a life quote. For the moderating factor sociosexual orientation no significant effect was found. Additionally, exploratory analysis showed that physical attractiveness moderates the effect of values on dating interest, such that a higher perceived level of attractiveness increases the importance of values. Together, these findings showed a continued effect of self-transcendence values on dating interest, even when controlling for physical attractiveness, indicating the importance of expressing self-transcendence values. Concluding that not only physical attractiveness is an important factor in online dating but the content of the description on the profile is also influential factor for the level of dating interest. Further research is needed to examine the effect of values when they are displayed is a more subtle way and to examine the potential effect of other values such as openness to change and conservation."

external challenges and internal dynamics, the study shows the multifaceted ways in which 
young individuals navigate the uncertainties of their evolving lives. The impacts of crises 
such as the COVID-19 pandemic, economic instabilities, housing challenges, and geopolitical 
conflicts are explored.
This study underscores the far-reaching implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
which has left an indelible mark on mental well-being, educational pursuits, and social

Based on stakeholder theory, the study examines the influence of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and long-term orientation (LTO) on the ESG scores of S&P 500 companies. Employing panel data analysis using random effects model the findings indicate that EO alone does not exhibit a significant relationship with ESG scores.
Surprisingly, LTO revealed a negative relationship with ESG scores. However, the interaction of EO and LTO positively affects ESG scores, highlighting their complementary nature. The results stress the need for firms to consider other factors, such as LTO, to promote long-term sustainability goals and drive sustainable business practices. This research expands the theoretical understanding of the relationship between entrepreneurship and sustainability and provides insights for managerial decision-making to enhance corporate environmental performance."

In particular, I examine four potential channels throughout which educational characteristics may impact buyout performance: (i) levels of education, (ii) specialized certifications, (iii) combination of levels of education and specialized certifications, and (iv) educational profile. By using ordinary least squares (OLS) models and a sample of 263 worldwide buyouts and 597 involved PE lead partners during 1997-2015, I find no significant influence of levels of education and/or specialized certifications on buyout performance. This applies to either individual variables or their combined effects. The results suggest that other factors such as work experience, practical skills, cognitive intelligence and motivation may also influence performance, making it difficult to isolate the impact of education alone. Furthermore, this study reveals that compared to LPTs with a non-business background, the teams with a broader educational profile (defined as a background in business combined with a non-business background) tend to outperform. However, the question whether a broader educational profile among LPTs can positively affect buyout performance still remains open. In case more empirical evidence is found in this direction, PE firms could use this knowledge to guarantee that at least one PE partner in the LPT has a business background and one has a nonbusiness background (this can be the same person) in order to enhance buyout performance. This would be of great relevance in a performance-driven industry such as PE."

The current understanding of the processes underlying this relationship is however lacking. This research provides further insights by analysing the role of the B Corp certification in early-stage investors’ decision process. Based on an exploratory abductive approach, 22 interviews with impact and traditional investors were conducted and analysed using process frameworks by Gompers et al. (2020) and Huang (2018). The B Corp certification is found to have minor effects on the decision process based on both ideologic and economic perceptions. Its role is much larger when cognitively evaluated within itself in terms of costs and benefits than as a source of quality signalling. The certification only significantly impacts the final selection decision if investors expect it to create a competitive advantage which outweighs the high cost of undergoing the certification process as an early-stage venture. These findings call into question the predominant assumption of a positive effect of the B Corp certification on funding chances due to quality signalling and highlight the need for further research into the relationship between voluntary sustainability certification and early-stage investors’ sensemaking."

emissions of portfolio companies, we find a carbon premium for lower unscaled Scope 2 
emissions of portfolio companies. This premium is not influenced by the size of the PE 
firm or the institutional pressure on the PE's home country, but significantly increases 
when the PE firm is an ESG Investor, defined as a UN PRI signatory. Furthermore, we 
find that larger PE are more likely to invest in lower carbon intensity companies. Greater 
institutional pressure in PE’s home country is associated with higher carbon emissions. 
We find no evidence that PE ESG investors hold portfolio companies with better carbon 
emissions performance. By providing evidence of a carbon exit premium, our results 
highlight the importance for PE investors to reduce the carbon footprint of their portfolios 
and commit to sustainable investing. We also raise concerns about the effectiveness of 
regulation and environmental initiatives, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation 
mechanisms to ensure the alignment of PE actions with sustainability commitments,

Through an extensive literature review, this study identifies key factors influencing the practice of lobbying and explores the role of different interest groups in shaping policy decisions. Empirical evidence suggests that while corporations and wealthy individuals possess a comparative advantage in exerting financial pressure, other groups, such as trade unions, also play a significant role advocating for collective interests. The objective of this research is to assess the extent to which corporate lobbying influences tax policies that favor corporations as a class and the effectiveness of political financing as a means to achieve this goal. Utilizing panel data models across five European countries over a 22-year period, the study focuses on corporate tax rates and top marginal income tax rates as key policy indicators. The analysis incorporates variables representing the ratio of private to non-private financing sources for government parties, serving as proxies for corporate lobbying through sponsorship and financial support. The findings of this empirical analysis reveal a significant relationship between the dependence on private financing by government political parties and a decrease in the corporate tax rate. This suggests that political parties aligned with business interests receive financial support from corporate lobbyists, creating an imbalance in the democratic process. Moreover, the study provides evidence of a causal effect between private financing dependence and the corporate tax rate, even when controlling for fixed effects and lags. However, the possibility of simultaneous causality bias remains, warranting further investigation and the identification of suitable instruments for analysis. Interestingly, no clear statistically significant relationship is found between private financing dependence and the top marginal income tax rate. Plausible explanations include the lower priority of business interests regarding this tax rate or the interplay of various factors influencing changes in income tax rates across different income brackets."

Additionally, a third research question tested whether trauma load predicts PTSD symptoms. The sample was composed of highly traumatized refugees. PTSD was measured with the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Substance-use was measured using the Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced Questionnaire (COPE). Anxiety and depression were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL). A step-wise multiple regression analysis was employed to explore PTSD as a predictor of substance-use, and anxiety and depression as moderators of this relationship. PTSD and anxiety symptoms were found to positively predict substance-use, and depression symptoms negatively predicted substance-use. Anxiety was a significant negative moderator of the relationship between PTSD and substance-use. Although the regression models were significant, they explained a small proportion of overall variance in substance-use scores. It appears that there are other variables that can explain a more substantial proportion of variance in substance-use, and future research should focus on identifying these variables."

Until now, it is uncertain whether such overgeneralisation predisposes for or evolves through ADs. This study investigated whether experiencing subclinical panic and being a woman, which are risk factors for AD and PD, increases fear overgeneralisation. It was expected that people with high versus low subclinical panic show more fear generalisation. Second, it was hypothesised that women display more overgeneralisation of fear than men, as women report more characteristics which are associated with fear overgeneralisation. Ninety-one participants encountered a generalisation paradigm consisting of circles gradually increasing in size. Either the smallest or largest circle was paired with an electrical stimulation, signalling threat, whereas the other was not, signalling safety. The intermediate circles functioned as generalisation stimuli. Fear generalisation to each circle was measured through fear potentiated startle (FPS), risk, and anxiety ratings. No significant effect of subclinical panic on fear overgeneralisation was found. Women did not show higher FPS, but higher risk ratings to more generalisation stimuli than men. These findings suggests that future prevention measures for PD should focus on different factors than decreasing fear generalisation. However, women might benefit from training in accurately evaluating presence of threat."

paper, we present the results of a nested PK sub study within CHAPAS-4 to investigate LPV/r PK
parameters combined with different NRTI-backbones using a WHO weight band dosing regimen.

Method
Patients in this sub study were randomized to LPV/r, as well as one of three NRTI-backbones. Children
received a dose based on WHO weight band standards. Generic LPV/r tablets were used in this study.
PK sampling was done in steady state conditions and a sample was taken at t=0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12
hours after supervised intake with a standardized breakfast. The minimal effective LPV concentration
was determined on 1.0 mg/L. Our aim was to compare LPV/r PK parameters among different NRTIbackbone and weight band groups. A second aim was to study whether the children received sufficient
LPV plasma concentrations.

Results
We had 41 eligible LPV and RTV PK profiles in this PK sub study. The GM (CV%) LPV AUC0-12h was 116,9
mg/L (36,0%). The LPV GM (CV%) LPV Ctrough was 7.6 mg/L (50.2%). No statistical significant LPV PK
parameters differences were found between the different NRTI-backbone groups. No children had
Ctrough concentrations below the minimal effective LPV concentration.

Conclusions
This nested sub study within CHAPAS-4 shows that current WHO weight band dosing and generic LPV
tablets deliver sufficient LPV plasma concentrations in second-line HIV therapy in African children.
Furthermore, we found no difference in LPV/r plasma concentrations between different NRTIbackbones, meaning LPV/r can be used safely besides TAF/FTC."
Is Invulnerability a Mediator between Attachment and Moral Judgment?,"['Đokić, Ema']","['Boom, Jan']",2023-09-07T23:00:44Z,EN,['attachment; invulnerability; moral evaluation; moral reasoning'],Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of invulnerability in the relationship between attachment and moral judgment among Serbian high school students. Some previous research has found a positive relationship between attachment and moral development, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms through which attachment dynamics contribute to moral judgment. Adolescents often exhibit a sense of invulnerability, perceiving themselves as immune to consequences or negative outcomes. This perception can impact their decision making, including the formation of ethical frameworks. Investigating how attachment experiences interact with invulnerability beliefs in shaping moral judgment provides insight into the psychological processes that underlie adolescents' moral decision-making. Data for the study were collected using an online questionnaire, including the Adolescent Invulnerability Scale (AIS), the Inventory of Peer and Parent Attachment – Revised (IPPA-R), and the Sociomoral Reflection Measure - Short Form Objective (SRM-SFO). A total of 407 high-school students participated in the study, 302 females, 93 males, and 12 missing. Age range was 14-19 years (M = 16.65, SD = 1.2). Regression analyses showed inconsistent results, thus the mediation model was not applicable. Invulnerability had a significant association with moral judgment, particularly danger invulnerability. Gender differences were found in regards to each construct and significantly impacted the relationships between attachment and moral judgment, as well as attachment and invulnerability."

Processing (NLP) techniques. In past time, Question & Answer interactions were handled
manually. Recent advancements in NLP and Machine Learning (ML) have created the opportunity to implement a plethora of Question & Answering Systems (QAS). These systems
often utilize a classifier to classify the questions into types before answering them. The
two most prominent classification methods historically are Rule-based models and Machine
Learning models. Rule-based models utilize grammar rules and a dictionary to classify questions into categories and map these to the correct answer. Machine Learning models, such
as neural networks, utilize mathematical equations to learn from a Question & Answer data
set, with the intention of minimizing classification errors when matching question and answer pairs. This research aims to discover how popular classification techniques perform in
a restricted domain environment, with regards to question type recognition and question
enrichment. These two tasks are performed on a large structured Dutch data set and a
public English data set. To determine how the classifiers score on these two tasks, two rigorous metrics are applied to determine classification power; F1 Score & Area under the ROC
surface (AUC). Results suggest that question ambiguity can be recognized with an F1-score
upwards of 90%. ML techniques featuring deep learning perform best across both question
type detection and question enrichment."

What will a hub-based offshore network in the North Sea look like by 2050?,"['Larsson Ström, Emma']","['Gazzani, Matteo']",2023-09-12T00:01:46Z,EN,['Offshore network; Linear optimisation'],Energy Science,"In light of climate change and energy security issues, ambitious decarbonisation targets have been set across Europe. A cornerstone of realising these goals is a massive expansion of offshore wind power located in the North Sea. This area is one of the most favourable locations for successful wind projects in the world, due to a reliable wind resource and shallow waters. Considering announced plans to build upwards of 300 GW of offshore wind in the North Sea, how to best integrate this into the existing onshore energy system remains uncertain. A possible solution that has gained momentum in recent years is the build-out of an integrated transmission network placed offshore. This could transport the energy generated from offshore wind farms via a hub-based system to several nations. The hub-based network can comprise both power and hydrogen transmission infrastructure, as well as electrolysers placed offshore. This project investigated potential configurations of such a hub-based offshore network in the North Sea by 2050, using a linear optimisation model. 2030 and 2040 were set as intermediate
simulation years to monitor developments across the time horizon. The results indicate substantial build-out of both power and hydrogen transmission infrastructure, across all modelling runs. It predominantly consists of electricity connections, but hydrogen connections are also present. The electricity network displays both hub-to-hub as well as hub-to-shore connectivity. Major connection points across the offshore power network were found to be the areas around offshore wind farms (OWF) East Anglia, Nederwiek, Dogger Bank, and German search areas N 17-20. The 2050 offshore hydrogen network exhibits hub-to-hub connections between OWFs East Anglia and Nederwiek, and far-from-shore German OWF search areas N 17-20 and British Dogger Bank respectively. All other offshore nodes display the build-out of hydrogen pipelines which are radially connected to the shore."

Odor perception plays an essential role in our food consumption. A change in diet may lead to changes in food-related olfactory perception through internalizing different flavors 
to which one is exposed. Olfactory perception is not only influenced by sensory information but also by cognitive factors. This study examines the influence of social norms and dietarian identities on olfactory perception. Data from 64 participants were collected using a mixed design. Participants rated odors labeled as ""favored by 
vegetarians/vegans"" or ""by omnivores"" and completed the Dietarian Identity Questionnaire (DIQ). Ratings were provided on a 10-point Likert scale, measuring pleasantness, intensity, and likelihood of consumption. Visible differences between the ratings of meat reducers and meat consumers and different influences through the labels could be observed, and the strength of dietarian identity influenced the impact of labels. The results of this study offer new impulses for plant-based food manufacturers and NGOs advocating meatless diets and provide valuable insights for future research on leveraging normative labels and dietarian identity to predict and 
influence odor perception."
"Adaptation Tipping Points and Pathways | Towards a long-term 
perspective on the solution space of coastal adaptation in the Southwestern Delta in 
the Netherlands","['Lokker, Jeroen']","['Wassen, Martin']",2023-09-12T00:01:34Z,EN,['Adaptation Tipping Point; Pathways; Southwestern Delta'],Water Science and Management,"In the coming century and beyond it is certain that sea-level will continue to rise, having a big impact 
on millions of people and their environment. However, the extent and rate of future sea-level rise (SLR) 
remain uncertain. To address the consequences posed by future SLR, long-term adaptation planning is 
needed (IPCC, 2022). This thesis aims to explore the solution space for coastal adaptation to SLR in the 
Southwestern Delta of the Netherlands. Central question of the thesis is: “which adaptation tipping 
points (ATP’s) and adaptation decisions are most decisive for the solution space for coastal adaptation 
to SLR, focussing on the Southwestern Delta and the management targets here for the sandy coastlines, 
flood risks and freshwater supply ”? It presents an assessment that considers the risk caused by an ATP, 
as well as the need for incremental or transformational measures to reduce this risk, referred to as the 
“decisiveness” of an ATP. Insight into pivotal decisions could provide short-term action and potentially 
avoid mal adaptation. Dutch water management favours adaptive delta management via a DAPP 
approach (Haasnoot et al., 2019c). Within four solution directions (“Protect-closed”, “Protect-open”, 
“Seaward” and “Accommodate”) the solution space of adaption to SLR can be described. This thesis is 
based on the same approach.
ATP’s were collected for the Southwestern Delta based on available reports and data bases and analysed. 
For the (sub)-basins of the Southwestern Delta, a few ATP’s were aggregated with exception of the 
Eastern Scheldt basin, where substantial ATP’s were aggregated. Consequently, the focus of this thesis 
is predominantly on the Eastern Scheldt basin as the main aim is to develop and test a method to 
determine the decisiveness of ATP’s. Further research is required to decide if all used ATP’s represent 
the complete picture in the Southwestern Delta.
Findings of ATP assessment of the Eastern Scheldt basin are amongst others that, with higher sea-levels
more decisive ATP’s occur and incremental adaptations may result in transformational adaptations. For 
example, with a minimal SLR of 1 meter the decision to keep the Eastern Scheldt basin open or closed 
arises. In this thesis all (sub)-areas were assessed separately. It is recommended to conduct a follow-up 
study in which the sub-areas of the Southwestern Delta are combined based on the method assessed 
in this thesis"

This thesis aims to assess whether a difference in capabilities in regions outside of the ‘Randstad’ causes people to become ‘disconnected’, which could in turn lead to the aforementioned mistrust in the central government. Through the construction of an index referring to the level of capabilities in different Dutch regions and mapping these indices, this thesis find some limited evidence of a difference in the level of capabilities between Dutch regions."

Aspen modelling and life cycle assessment of the gasification of DKR 350 plastic waste,"['Sprenger, Mark']","['Shen, Li']",2023-09-12T00:01:49Z,EN,"['Aspen; modelling; kinetic modelling; gasification; plastic recycling; plastic waste; DKR 350; DKR350, waste to feedstock; circular economy; chemical recycling']",Energy Science,"The Netherlands is frontrunner in the European Union in recycling plastic waste, employing mechanical recycling for 45% of the waste stream while incinerating the remaining 55% with energy recovery. The share which currently not recycled are mostly mixed and contaminated plastics. Mechanical recycling requires a mostly pure and uncontaminated input and is therefore not well-suited for handling the remaining plastic waste flow. Gasification, on the other hand, is a chemical recycling technique which is better suited for handling streams of contaminated plastics. Despite its potential, modelling of plastic waste gasification is still in its infancy. Furthermore, no life cycle assessment (LCA) research had been conducted evaluating the influence of reactor parameters on the global warming potential (GWP) associated with this process. This thesis aims to bridge the gap by further developing and validating an Aspen Plus model and using it to address the following research question: “What is the global warming potential of gasifying DKR 350 plastic waste compared to incineration in the Netherlands and what are the key reactor parameters that influence this impact?” Based on the LCA results, the study reveals that gasification of DKR 350 plastic waste in the Netherlands has approximately half the GWP impact of incineration. Furthermore, increasing the reactor parameters steam to feedstock ratio and equivalence ratio exacerbates the GWP impact, indicating the importance of optimizing these parameters. The reactor parameters ‘air on the riser’ and temperature show minimal influence on GWP. However, the conclusions drawn from the LCA are subject to inaccuracies stemming from the Aspen model. Recommendations are proposed to enhance the accuracy of both the Aspen model and the LCA, enabling verification and increased significance of the results. Future research should focus on obtaining additional experimental data to improve the accuracy of the Aspen model, while keeping in mind that the purpose of modelling is to supplement and reduce the required experimental research."
The Influence of Humour on Feelings of Guilt and Motivation when Committing a Moral Misstep,"['Gelderen, Mandy van']","['Strick, Madelijn']",2023-09-12T00:01:32Z,EN,"['moral humour, competence humour, guilt, motivation, moral misstep']","Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","With the current climate crisis, more and more people are setting goals for themselves regarding climate-conscious living. However, sticking to such goals is sometimes difficult, and people may slip up. This can trigger feelings of guilt and shame that make them give up. The current study investigated how humour influences feelings of guilt and motivation. This was investigated using an experiment with a within-subject design (N  = 117) with three conditions and a baseline. Different stories were shown to the participants in which the main character committed a misstep and a friend responded to this with either criticism in the form of no humour, moral humour, competence humour or no critique (the baseline). The results showed that the competence humour condition caused less guilt and more motivation compared to the no humour condition. In addition, the competence humour condition resulted in less guilt and more motivation than the moral humour condition. The difference in motivation was mediated by the difference in feelings of guilt. Furthermore, the results showed that giving no criticism resulted in the most motivation and least feelings of guilt. Although it seems that no critique works best when coping with moral missteps, competence humour is almost as effective. Therefore, it would be interesting for future research to examine the effect of no critique and competence humour combined. Eventually, these insights can be helpful and can be used in social circles to motivate others to stick to moral standards after committing a misstep."

A Material Flow Analysis for Defining Utrecht University’s Zero-Waste Goals,"['Raidma, Merilin']","['Shen, Li']",2023-09-28T00:01:03Z,EN,[],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"As the European Union and the Dutch government are moving towards a circular economy, Utrecht University (UU) has set a goal of becoming a zero-waste organization by 2030. Circularity is often contextualized using the R-ladder, which provides a hierarchy for waste management. UU’s current definition of zero-waste requires materials to be processed at a level of recycling or higher. Since the understanding of current waste streams remained vague, this study investigated the university’s waste flows, how they are processed, and recycled material yields as well as potential mitigation solutions. 
A material flow analysis (MFA), a commonly used tool for evaluating the performance of the existing waste systems, was conducted to investigate waste management at UU. Two scopes were used: a narrower scope examining the sources of waste at the university and a boarder scope incorporating downstream processing. The MFA looked at solid waste categories collected by waste handlers in the year 2022. Potential mitigation ideas were then collected via stakeholder interviews and desk research. 
The largest problematic waste streams were residual and hazardous waste. Residual waste originated from a variety of buildings while hazardous waste was generated by faculties of Geosciences, Sciences, and Veterinary Medicine. These natural science faculties created more waste per person than other faculties and had more varied waste streams. The expanded scope showed a 12.9% increase in waste sent to incineration and revealed recycled material yields of 43.6% and 75.7% for waste sent to composting/anaerobic digestion and sorting/recycling, respectively. Waste mitigation ideas identified included the elimination of single use items, increasing waste separation, focusing on circular procurement, and collaborating with external parties to identify novel mitigation ideas. 
The additional material loss identified in the expanded scope suggests the importance of considering downstream processing when establishing a zero-waste goal. Prioritizing R-ladder ambitions at higher levels is suggested to avoid downstream losses. Limitations to the study include the snapshot nature of the MFA, data uncertainties, and a constantly changing regulatory environment. Special attention was drawn to the data gap on exact waste stream composition and insufficient communication regarding UU’s waste policies. 
The research demonstrated the barriers and opportunities for UU to become zero-waste. Some of the university’s essential functions generate waste for which there are currently no alternatives. Further research into the composition of waste streams, monitoring of waste management using the expanded scope, and aiming at higher R-level strategies is recommended."
Water classification using a Random Forest model to limit river erosion in Bangladesh,"['Gadellaa, Lars']","['Straatsma, Menno']",2023-09-28T00:01:13Z,EN,['Random forest; water classification; Sentinel-1; Landsat; Bangladesh; radar; erosion; Meghna estuary; water extents; near real-time'],Applied Data Science,"Riverbank erosion is a significant issue in Bangladesh that is mainly caused by heavy rainfall in the Meghna estuary. Erosion predictions can help when planning and taking measures to protect land from erosion. One method of obtaining erosion predictions is via the Bangladesh Erosion Monitor, this is a dashboard that predicts what land is at risk of erosion using the Joint Research Center Global Surface Water Explorer (JRC-GSWE) monthly water extents. The use of JRC-GSWE water extents in the Bangladesh Erosion Monitor is not ideal due to the fact the data were last updated in December of 2021, making it impossible to provide recent erosion predictions. 

This study aims to provide an alternative water classification method that creates water extents like the JRC-GSWE water extents. The proposed model is a Random Forest model using Sentinel-1 radar data as opposed to the Landsat data used for the JRC-GSWE water extents. An advantage Sentinel-1 data has over Landsat data is that radar data is not affected by cloud cover. The following research question needs to be answered to achieve the study aim: 

“How can a Random Forest classification model utilizing Sentinel-1 data be developed to produce near real-time water extents for Bangladesh that are comparable to or surpass the JRC-GSWE water extents?”

To achieve this, a Random Forest model was created that uses available bands from Sentinel-1 data to create near real-time water extents. Different preprocessing methods were tested on the Sentinel-1 data to achieve the best similarity to the JRC-GSWE water extents and performance. Similarity and performance were assessed with the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. Furthermore, a validation polygon dataset was created to assess the performance of the proposed Random Forest model water extents and JRC-GSWE water extents when comparing them to the polygons. The proposed Random Forest model showed to be capable of creating reliable predictions with an average overall accuracy of 96,7% and water extents similar to the JRC-GSWE water extents with an average Kappa coefficient of 0,879. When looking at the performance of both models when compared to the validation polygon dataset, they both show to be accurate with an accuracy of roughly 97%. These results show that the proposed Random Forest model can create water extents that are very similar to the JRC-GSWE water extents with the added benefits that they can be created in near real-time and are not affected by cloud cover."
Pseudo-orthogonal Yang-Mills theories and connections to gravity,"['Mistretta, Giovanni']","['Prokopec, T.']",2023-09-27T23:01:08Z,EN,[],Theoretical Physics,"The goal of this thesis is to study pseudo-orthogonal Yang-Mills actions and understand under which conditions they contain the Hilbert-Einstein action free of instabilities. The physical motivation is to construct a renormalizable theory of quantum gravity. We first provide the mathematical background necessary to introduce gauge theories in curved spacetime and General Relativity. Subsequently, we develop the concept of geometrical Yang-Mills theory, i.e. YangMills theories for which part of the gauge connection takes also the role of the cotetrad fields. The resulting theory retains only a part of the original gauge group as its group of symmetry. We show that for some pseudo-orthogonal groups one obtains the Hilbert action (and consequently Einstein’s equations) as part of the theory. Then, specializing to a coordinate system, we derive the Hamiltonian of such theories and we analyze the constraints that arise in phase space due to the redundancy of the Yang-Mills Lagrangian. We study the class of such constraints and it turns out that the theory possesses both first and second class constraints. Finally, we establish the conditions under which the constraints are preserved by the evolution. The next steps – left for future work – would include the study of dynamics, stability and symmetry breaking to the theory that at low energies would be equivalent to Einstein’s general relativity."
Validation of a Bayesian mixture model for language contact with the use of synthetic language data,"['Keus, David']","['Verstegen, Judith']",2023-09-28T00:01:00Z,EN,['bayesian;sBayes;artificial;language;data;contact'],Applied Data Science,"Speaker communities typically have some level of interaction and are not
completely isolated. When individuals who speak different languages
come into contact, it is probable that their respective languages undergo
a process of convergence.

Ranacher et al. (2021) have developed a method, sBayes, to estimate the
relative role of language contact, as opposed to inheritance and universal
preference, in creating similarities between languages. The model promises
to identify contact areas from empirical data using (Bayesian) inference.
However, validation of the approach proves difficult since they use em-
pirical data of real-world language in which, by definition, actual contri-
butions of language contact, inheritance and universal preference are not
known.

To further validate the sBayes model, a dataset is needed from which we
know our expected descriptive contact, inheritance and universal prefer-
ence values prior to the model run. This dataset can then be compared to
the output of sBayes.

For this purpose, we created synthetic language datasets using an agent-
based model to test the accuracy of sBayes. Using these datasets we con-
ducted two experiments, one to validate sBayes ability to detect isolated
causal explanations per language feature. The second to test sBayes fit to
an artificial language dataset and in determining language areas (clusters)
and overall causality counts.

Our results suggest that synthetic language data can successfully be used
for validation purposes of the sBayes language model. sBayes accuracy on
identifying clearly isolated causalities has a combined mean squared error
of 0.05 in our simulations. In a simulated real life situation, the model find
a similar amount of contact areas. In addition, the overall distribution of
feature state causality is the same in our synthetic data when we compare
it to a benchmark experiment."
One Hundred Years of Polarization: Contesting Nationalisms in Turkey,"['Tanbay, Leyla']","['Tamimi Arab, P.']",2023-09-28T00:00:54Z,EN,['Nationalism/Turkey/Secularism/Religious Nationalism/Sacralization'],Religious Studies,"The Republic of Turkey has become increasingly polarized in the last decade. There is a democratic backslide, economic instability, and lack of human rights under the presidency of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. These developments, however, did not change Erdoğan ́s voting base. The recent presidential elections on May 28, 2023, have resulted in his favor with 52.18% of the votes. This thesis argues that the political decisions of voters in Turkey are based on ideology more than on provided services. The two main ideologies present in the public sphere are religious nationalism and secular nationalism. Through historical analysis of government policies and discourses, this thesis shows the development of different nationalisms. It takes the public sphere as a site of power hierarchies and argues that the regime of visibility governments create forms the national subject. The secular national subject is formed in the early Republican era through Kemalist reforms and regulation of religion by the state. The religious national subject has been excluded from the public sphere until the 1980s and only gained presence with the rise of the AKP in 2002. Atatürk has become the ultimate symbol of secularism and modernity for secular nationalists, while Erdoğan is the symbol of anti-secular dictatorship. For religious nationalists, however, Atatürk is the symbol of oppression and Erdoğan is the savior. This thesis argues that the increasing polarization of these contesting nationalisms is due to the sacralization of political leaders and ideologies."
Determination of Dutch Landrace goats in paintings to support breeding goals,"['Doré, Michel']","['Salah, Albert']",2023-09-28T00:00:49Z,EN,[],Applied Data Science,"Dutch Landrace goats, primarily kept for their cultural and heritage value, have witnessed a decline in their population and a consequent loss of distinctive aesthetics. The Dutch Landrace goat traces its ancestry to a mere four individuals in 1958, complicating efforts to retrieve its original aesthetic features. In recent years, the Landelijke Fokkersclub Nederlandse Landgeiten has attempted to address these issues. The aim of the breeders club is to preserve the Dutch Landrace goat. Obtaining more specific knowledge on what morphological characteristics were dominant is crucial for the breeding program. For this study, a dataset of historic paintings and drawings containing goats was collected and provided by the breeding club. The objective was to discover, using Procrustes analysis, whether the 2D representations derived from the dataset could aid in enhancing the breeding program, using machine learning techniques and morphological analysis. The results indicate that, while Procrustes analysis provided useful insights into the morphological variations among Dutch Landrace goats, the reliability of the outcomes was impacted by variations in artistic representations and the quality of input images. Machine learning techniques were effective in extracting goats from images, yet were limited by the quality and realism of the data. These findings underscore the potential of integrating machine learning and geometric morphometrics in historical morphology research, while also highlighting the challenges associated with data noise and reproducibility. Further research in this domain is encouraged, as the possibilities to implement new machine leaning techniques become more accessible."

A lack of design knowledge about checklists in these organizations is one of the barriers to checklist use and research. The aim of this research is to develop design knowledge that can serve as a basis for these organizations to improve checklists for their business processes. After analyzing widely researched checklists in aviation and healthcare industries, we en- gineered requirements and developed design principles that contribute to the design knowledge of everyday organizations.

The design principles were validated on their applicability by conducting six interviews with potential end-users in the domains of retail, hospitality, and education. The validation shows that two design principles seem reusable, one design principle seems less suitable for reuse, and one design principle seems not suitable for reuse.

This research contributes a set of design principles for checklists to be used in everyday organizations, which results in a potential rise in checklist use and research in these organizations. Future research could analyze other domains, validate design principles in other domains, and use different methods of developing and validating the design principles."

It is a disease that increases the chance of developing other diseases, such as heart disease or certain cancers. Obesity is a problem worldwide, however, currently, the proportion of people classified as obese is increasing quicker in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) compared to high-income countries (HICs). Obesity is also considered an inherited condition, with genetic information playing a big role in how likely people develop it. Since 2008, a type of genetic research known as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been used to identify specific genes associated with obesity. These genes, also called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), vary between individual people and populations. More recent research has shown that different SNPs can interact with a person’s environment or lifestyle choices, such as their diet or levels of exercise, to either increase or decrease their risk of obesity. Like GWAS, studies investigating gene-environment interactions (GxE), have mainly been performed in HICs among European populations. However, findings from GxE research in HICs cannot be assumed to be the same in LMICs. This is because people living in LMICs have different ethnic backgrounds with different genetic information, and live in different environments with different lifestyles. At present, research analysing GxE on obesity in LMICs is limited but growing. This review discusses what research is available, and brings to light areas for improvement for future scientific studies. Three different databases, which contain millions of scientific research articles, were searched using combinations of key words such as ‘obesity’, ‘diet’ ‘LMIC’ and ‘SNP’. Search results up until November 2022 were checked and irrelevant research was excluded. From these results, eighteen research papers were considered relevant to this review. The risk of bias was assessed for all included studies, which is the risk that a scientific study may have presented misleading results due to how they designed the study or collected scientific data. Overall, 14 different SNPs were found to significantly interact with different lifestyle factors to change the likelihood of an individual being obese. However, significant interactions were not repeated across different research studies or in different populations. This review also highlighted several problems with the way current scientific studies collected lifestyle information, or how they defined or classified obesity using varied BMI cut-off values. Statistical analyses were also outdated, relied on information found in old European-based GWAS, or were weakened by small numbers of research participants. Future scientific studies in LMICs should therefore focus on improving the quality of their research, by using standardised data-collection methods, updated statistical techniques, and information from GWAS performed in populations of the same ethnicity."
Quantum Algorithms For Compositional Distributional Semantics in Natural Language Processing,"['Pagni, Vittorio']","['Stoof, H.T.C.']",2023-03-02T01:01:42Z,EN,['quantum; circuit ; machine learning; adjectives; adjective representation; quantum computing; quantum information; parsing; categorial grammars; quantum mechanics'],Theoretical Physics,"In this thesis, we try to combine machine learning and quantum computing in order to simultaneously perform
different readings of a sentence. In the first part, we introduce a procedure to obtain a distributional tensor representation for adjectives seen as endomorphisms on the noun space. We accomplish this by discretizing the surface of
the n-sphere, where the noun embeddings lie, and finding local approximations. We show how the analysis of their
activity distributions can give us some information about their action in the noun space. We also provide different
options to approximate their local behavior and visually represent their activity. This approach could, in principle, be
applied to any kind of transformation in the sense of the types of categorial grammars. The second section, which
is devoted to the quantum approach to the problem, explains how these classical representations can be effectively
encoded into quantum states. Additionally, it involves the introduction of some quantum circuits, which, when used
in conjunction with a traditional machine learning strategy, enable us to simultaneously perform several readings of
ambiguous sentences using index contractions and to assign them a likelihood score."

I will present a novel way to model the hybrid Unit Commitment (UC) and Economic Dispatch (ED) problem as a variation of an interior point problem, which allows the problem to be tackled by common local-search metaheuristics. On top of that, my state representation is highly intuitive, adaptable and can accept any cost function and many constraints with relative ease. I will also compare my findings with the pre-existing literature and I will show that this method can find an improvement of a known optimum for at least one well known instance of the hybrid UC/ED problem. I will also show that this method exhibits interesting search behaviour which can be preferable in networks with renewable energy sources and various other robustness concerns."
Oceanic and Atmospheric Controls on Decadal Ice Shelf Basal Melt Variability around the Amundsen Sea,"['Janzing, Joren']","['Wal, Roderik van de']",2023-03-02T01:01:19Z,EN,['Antarctica; Amundsen sea; Ocean; Ice shelves; 1940; Decadal;'],Climate Physics,"Warm ocean waters are driving the rapid ice loss around the Amundsen Sea, Antarctica. Decadal variability
in melt and on-shelf heat transport is thought to be controlled by zonal shelf break winds and Pacific sea
surface temperatures, leading to the hypothesis that a strong El Ni ̃no in the 1940s initiated the present-day
glacier retreat. This report investigates the controls on decadal melt variability by analysing simulations
from a regional ocean model for the Amundsen Sea. This model was forced by an ensemble of 20 global
climate model simulations for the years 1920 until 2014.
Ice shelf basal mass loss has a strong connection with heat advection in seabed troughs in the simula-
tions. Averaged over the ensemble, zonal shelf break winds and the El Ni ̃no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are
weakly correlated with basal mass loss. Individual members show a large spread, likely related to regional
factors such as the Amundsen Sea Low and local factors such as sea ice and shelf water properties. Variability
in baroclinic flow and salinity at the western shelf break suggest that melt could be sensitive to freshwater
fluxes from ice shelves and sea ice. The occurrence of a large melt event in the 1940s depends on these
factors. Finally, simulations with an advanced grounding line have minimal influence on decadal variability.
Since ocean boundary conditions are fixed, the internal variability in the model is thus atmospherically forced.
The results underscore the importance of using a model ensemble and long time scales when modelling this
system. Furthermore, the limited influence of large scale atmospheric forcing on melt makes accurate future
projections more difficult. Further research is necessary to disentangle internal feedbacks and forcings."
"Predictive factors for antipsychotic treatment adherence among first-episode psychosis
patients in the first year after remission","['Broxterman, Imke']","['Koster, E.S.']",2023-03-01T00:00:55Z,EN,['Treatment non-adherence; antipsychotics;FEP;First Episode Psychosis;Schizophrenia;Riskfactors'],Farmacie,"Abstract
Background: Adherence rates to antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia are low, while good adherence is
important for achieving and maintaining remission. In patients with a ‘First Episode of Psychosis’ (FEP),
early medication adherence can influence the further course of the illness. Identification of risk factors for
non-adherence to antipsychotics in patients with an FEP in the first year after remission could prove useful.
Methods: This study was conducted with patients aged 16 to 55 years old, using antipsychotic medication,
and in symptomatic remission of their first psychotic episode for 3-6 months. Medication adherence was
determined with the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) and validated with self-reported adherence rates.
Covariate adjustment was performed to determine the influence of overlapping prescriptions on the MPR.
The relationship between several patient- and environment-related factors with treatment adherence was
assessed with linear regression.
Results: A total of 260 patients were included in the MPR calculation, of which 88,8% had a good treatment
adherence. The MPR had a very weak correlation with the self-reported adherence rates (p = 0.005). Side
effects (p = 0.013) were positively associated with treatment adherence while patients experiencing more
self-stigma were less adherent (p = 0.030). Overlapping prescriptions accounted for 25% of the variance in
the MPR. After covariate adjustment, only the duration of psychosis was associated with treatment
adherence (p = 0.001).
Conclusion: The MPR is sensitive to prescribing behavior, therefore correction for overlapping
prescriptions is advised. Intervention strategies focused on lowering self-stigma among FEP patients could
improve their adherence rates"
The Lost Generation and an American Flirtation: The Effects of War on Literary Culture as Exemplified by the Life and Writings of Harry Crosby,"['Huisman, Juliette']","['Pascoe, D.A.']",2023-03-02T01:01:01Z,EN,['Harry Crosby; Literature; Literary Movement; Lost Generation; Post-War; Sigmund Freud; Trauma; War; World War I; 1920s'],Literature Today,"This paper examines Harry Crosby’s life and writings within the broader context of the literary movement that is the Lost Generation. In the 1920s, men and women who had come of age during the First World War faced changes that the conflict had brought on. No longer feeling at home in the tradition and country in which they were born, Americans like Crosby moved to Paris where they would come together, forming a unique post-war literary movement. 
	Incorporating analyses and discussions of historical context, contemporary Freudian theories on war and death, and literary, poetic and diaristic writings, this thesis illustrates that the often overlooked works by Crosby encapsulate the essence of the Lost Generation. It argues that understanding his, at times, unique and extreme writings provide insight into what is at the centre of the literary movement as a whole: loss. By looking back at the literature of a century ago, the effects of life-altering experiences on the writings of a new generation might be better understood."

Effect of a vegetarian diet on the gut microbiome and major depressive disorder,"['Janssen, Esmée']","['Wösten, Marc']",2023-03-14T01:01:17Z,EN,['major depressive disorder; vegetarian diet; gut-brain axis; short-chain fatty acids; Lactobacillus; Bifidobacterium; tryptophan; tyrosine'],One Health,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the leading contributors to global disease burden. There are several mechanisms that might affect MDD. First of all, several neurotransmitters are involved in MDD; reduced levels of serotonin, dopamine noradrenaline, norepinephrine, epinephrine and GABA are associated with MDD. Contrarily, excessive levels of glutamate can aggravate depressive symptoms. Besides neurotransmitters, levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are reduced in MDD patients. Furthermore, MDD is characterized by a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Lastly, inflammation seems to aggravate depressive symptoms. The gut-brain axis has been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of depression. First of all, gut microbes can regulate the synthesis of neurotransmitters, which can signal the vagus nerve or enter the blood circulatory system. Furthermore, the gut can produce metabolites that affect the brain, most prominently short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Lastly, gut microbes can have (anti-)inflammatory effects on the host. Although gut microbes can affect the brain via the gut-brain axis, there is no clear shift in the microbiome composition of MDD patients, as literature reports are conflicting. Nonetheless, probiotic studies indicate that Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium can alleviate depressive symptoms. A vegetarian diet decreased Bifidobacterium species and Lactobacillus amylovorus, suggesting a disadvantageous effect of a vegetarian diet on MDD. Meat consumption enhances serotonin and tryptophan (serotonin precursor) levels in the gut. However, this does not necessarily enhance serotonergic neurotransmission in the brain. Besides serotonin, tryptophan is also a precursor for kynurenine. Kynurenine can induce a neurotoxic effect. Meat consumption may inhibit kynurenine pathway by increasing Lactobacillus. However, meat-induced inflammation may upregulate the neurotoxic pathway of kynurenine. Besides tryptophan, tyrosine might also affect MDD. Tyrosine is a precursor for dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine. Tyrosine is synthesized in the gut. However, dietary tyrosine did not induce antidepressant effects. Thus, the effect of tyrosine metabolism on MDD remains unclear. Vitamins might affect MDD as well. Both vitamins abundant in a vegetarian diet (folate) as well as in an omnivorous diet (B12) could enhance monoaminergic neurotransmission. Moreover, meat, which is high in sulfide and zinc, seems to stimulate GABAergic neurotransmission and inhibit glutamergic neurotransmission. D-amino acids, which are abundant in a vegetarian diet, may stimulate glutamatergic neurotransmission, whilst folate seems to reduce it. Moreover, both a vegetarian and omnivorous diet can result in metabolites that enhance BDNF levels. Lastly, it is important to emphasize that an omnivorous diet induces inflammation, which could aggravate MDD. Hence, through different metabolites, a vegetarian and omnivorous diet are able to either positively or negatively impact MDD. The conflicting results might suggest there is no direct relation between a vegetarian diet and MDD. Nonetheless, ambiguous results might also suggest the need for additional research, as the relation between diet, the gut microbiome and cognitive functioning is very complex."
The Moderating Role of Collectivism in the Relation Between Parental Guilt-Induction and Need Frustration,"['Malea, Melina']","['Kaap-Deeder, J.J.H van der']",2023-03-14T01:01:07Z,EN,['Self-Determination Theory; guilt-induction; need frustration; intra-cultural variability; collectivism'],Clinical Psychology,"According to Self-Determination Theory (SDT), parental guilt-induction is linked with children’s ill-being by frustrating their basic needs. Studies have shown that need frustration is universal once guilt-induction is perceived as controlling. Nevertheless, scholars support that cultural background could moderate this relation. Most research on guilt-induction, has mainly focused on the cross-cultural differences in the effects of guilt-induction on need frustration. Despite literature showing individual differences in cultural values within countries, the relationship has yet to be explored from an intra-cultural perspective. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the moderating role of individual values of collectivism in the relation between objective and perceived guilt-induction and the relation between perceived guilt-induction and need frustration. The total sample comprised 227 participants (Mage= 21.50, SDage= 2.18), with 78.9 % being female. Participants completed an online survey and were randomly assigned to three vignettes (i.e., guilt-induction/high warmth, guilt-induction/low warmth or autonomy-support). Participants indicated the degree to which they perceived guilt-induction in response to the vignette and filled out a need frustration scale. Results revealed that collectivism did not moderate the relation between objective and perceived guilt-induction, nor the relation between perceived guilt-induction and need frustration. Nonetheless, further research should be conducted as it can potentially have implications in healthcare."

The study was conducted via an online survey tool. The results showed that parental autonomy support positively related to independent self-construal. Nationality was also related to independent self-construal (MTurkish > MGerman) but was not a moderator, and there was no significant difference found between Turkish and German young adults’ independent self-construal scores. Current findings of this study expand the literature by further confirming the link between autonomy support and independent self-construal, indicating that autonomy support amplifies the integration of independent cultural values into the self, notwithstanding nationality."

It argues that the philosophical history of Western modernity has led us to endorse an ontological framework which harbors problematic commitments to (Cartesian) dualism. It implicates this dominant dualist ontology in the current ecological crisis, and connects it to the subjugation of matter, which traditional ethics considers morally insignificant. The thesis first explains current standard views on the moral status of inanimate objects. Thereafter it outlines the history of the Western philosophical paradigm, demonstrates how the standard (environmental) ethical approaches are founded on problematic dualisms, and argues that Western commitments to dualism should be reconsidered. It analyzes the potential of commonly discussed alternatives to the standard ethical approaches, concludes that they fail to fully reject problematic dualisms, and argues that insights from ‘new’ materialist, ecofeminist, and Indigenous scholarship offer alternative ontological approaches which might help us reimagine inanimate matter as morally considerable. Finally, it discusses how these insights might change our understanding of the moral dimensions of a particular case study."

This study examines burn survivors’ level of depression at six months post-burn, including the influence of body image dissatisfaction and partner support on depression (partner support at three months post- burn). Participants that were used in this study included 266 burn survivors. Burn survivors’ body image dissatisfaction, depression, and partner support were measured by the SWAP scale, the BDI-II, and the POSR scale. Body image dissatisfaction, %TBSA, prior suffering from depression, gender, and partner support were measured as possible predictors of depression. In addition, body image dissatisfaction was measured as a possible mediator between %TBSA and depression, and gender and depression. Body image dissatisfaction, %TBSA, and gender were found to have a significant effect on burn survivors’ depression post-burn injury. Higher levels of body image dissatisfaction and higher %TBSA levels predicted higher depression levels. Females scored higher on body image dissatisfaction and depression compared to males. Body image dissatisfaction was found to have a mediating role between the relationship of %TBSA and depression, and the relationship between gender and depression. Prior suffering from depression and partner support did not have a significant effect on depression post-burn injury. When treating depression in burn survivors, gender differences, including body image dissatisfaction, should be considered."
The mediating effect of Loneliness between Psychological Attachment and Social anxiety,"['Breit, Paulina']","['Gericke, Renate']",2023-03-14T01:01:09Z,EN,['psychological attachment; social anxiety; loneliness'],Clinical Psychology,"The feeling of loneliness has been increasing worldwide and can be influenced by multiple
factors, such as psychological attachment (Lim et al., 2020; Ernst & Cacioppo, 1999). In
particular, the attachment domains avoidance and anxiety, were found to have a positive
relationship with feelings of loneliness, while secure attachment does not. Loneliness was
found to elicit negative consequences, such as social anxiety, due to limited social
relationships caused by loneliness (Lim et al., 2016; Suri et al., 2019; Erozkan, 2011;
Manning et al., 2017). Previous research did not study the influence of loneliness on the
relationship between attachment and social anxiety, despite the fact that loneliness is rooted in
the attachment process and negatively impacts social anxiety severely (Ernst & Cacioppo,
1999). Therefore, this study hypothesized that loneliness mediates the relationship between
attachment and social anxiety, which was investigated for secure attachment, anxious, and
avoidant attachment domains. The sample comprised 94 respondents, 69 female, 22 male, and
three non-binary participants between the ages 18 and 34. The outcomes revealed that
loneliness was found to mediate the relationship between avoidant and anxious attachment
domains and social anxiety, but not for secure attachment. The implications of this study are
that clinical interventions should consider the interplay of attachment, loneliness, and social
anxiety. Thus, treatment should focus on all three factors rather than addressing isolated
issues to best assist patients."

This study aims to investigate whether the established findings of self-concept clarity and trait mindfulness remain significant when tested as moderators between self-esteem and depressive symptoms. The second aim was to see if having high self-concept clarity and high trait mindfulness buffers even more for low self-esteem in the context of depressive symptoms. This study was a cross-sectional study with 841 psychology students of the behavioural science department of a Dutch university aged 18 – 58 years (M = 21; SD = 2.7). All the constructs were assessed with a self-report questionnaire. The two moderators were added stepwise before they were combined, leading to three separate regression models. The results of the regression models supported the previous findings that self-concept clarity and trait mindfulness buffer low self-esteem. However, having both does not lower the depressive symptoms even more. Nevertheless, the study showed that self-concept clarity and trait mindfulness have unique effects on the relationship between self-esteem and depressive symptoms."
A biomarker-based paleotemperature record over the last 3 million years west off Tasmania,"['Lamprou, Fotini']","['Bijl, Peter']",2023-03-02T01:01:44Z,EN,['paleoclimate; paleotemperature; Pleistocene; biomarkers; Tasmania; Subtropical Front'],Marine Sciences,"The last 3 Ma is a crucial period for the Earth’s climate evolution as it went through the transition from a warm mid-late Pliocene (~3.2 Ma) into the colder late Pliocene- early Pleistocene (~2.5 Ma), with larger ice sheets and high amplitude glacial to interglacial cycles. During the Mid Pleistocene Transition (MPT), in the field of palaeoceanography, the Southern Ocean has been proposed as one of the key regions of the global ocean, as during the Quaternary, subantarctic waters of the Southern Ocean cooled by 4-9oC, as a result of a northward movement of the fronts in the Indian Ocean sector, the Great Australian Bright and the Tasmanian regions. The sedimentary record around Tasmania thus represents a perfect archive to record the oceanographic conditions in this region and especially the latitudinal position of the Subtropical Front (STF), which emerged as a key parameter in the global climate due to its influence on Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. We here present the continuous BAYSPAR and BAYSPLINE-based SST record of the Subtropical Front in the Southern Ocean at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1168 in western Tasmania, to identify the consequences of the SST changes observed at this site, for the oceanographic conditions, specifically the strength and the position of the subtropical front. This extra record of SST change is a long-term high-resolution analysis of organic geochemistry proxies and yields a better understanding of the influence of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean on Late Pliocene and Quaternary based on temperature proxies. Previous studies (Bostock et al., 2015; Sikes et al., 2009) in this area,  focused on the isotope signals which are significantly influenced by other factors, such as seasonality or rainfall, presenting a short-term analysis, however, here we present a long-term continuous high-resolution analysis of temperature records based on organic geochemistry proxies for the late Pliocene and Quaternary. 

Lower reflectance values, at Site 1168, were reported during interglacial periods while higher values were depicted during glacial, indicating that glacial sediments mainly consist of foraminifera ooze while interglacial sediments mainly contain nannofossil ooze. SST records decrease from 3 to approximately 1.3 Ma, on average 6 degrees to 4 degrees, and then increase until modern, presenting a constant variability in temperature of 9 to 18 degrees throughout the record. Subtropical Front (STF) faced an extremely low value of 3-4oC during MIS16, at approximately 0.6 Ma and after this period STF SST eventually increases to the modern levels of about 16 to 23 oC. However, our results suggest that non-thermal factors, such as water column oxygenation and nutrient supply, may influence GDGT cyclization which is linked to some cold bias in the TEX86-based SST records. Site 1168 presents a temperature difference of 9-18 degrees throughout the records, except the early Pleistocene period (~2.3 Ma); this variability is higher than the equatorial sites which is a sign of polar amplification and it is closely related to glacial-interglacial migration of the subtropical front, resulting in a northward movement of STF and a shift of the Subtropical Convergence to ~42oS west of Tasmania, at approximately 0.02 Ma."

It is both too fast and too slow, it is everywhere and nowhere at once. So, to make historical sense of environmental change’s origins and effects requires not a single history, but diverse narratives and temporalities. Recent scholarship in the environmental humanities has claimed that most historical narratives remain too anthropocentric and teleological to properly capture environmental change’s histories in print. Until now, that is, as scholars argue that a rapidly growing awareness of global climate change signifies an epistemic break towards multitemporal “Anthropocene histories”.
This thesis instead identifies stronger historical roots and diverse social and scientific entanglements of historians’ temporalities through case studies of U.S. environmental histories. Through an analysis, inspired by recent theoretical history, of these works’ temporalities, this thesis reveals heterogenous origins of innovative temporal elements, with changes of abstract environmental awareness just one of many driving factors. In particular, this thesis argues that composing temporally diverse histories, which are representative of both human and non-human pasts, necessarily requires an interdisciplinary methodology and socio-cultural engagement. Such diverse methodology can include an acute awareness of ecological history, implementation of (already exiting) less-linear narrative frameworks and interviewing."

This paradigm is well known in other materials, among which graphene stands first. When specific effects are taken into account, however, a gap is opened at the Dirac points and the quasiparticles become massive: a semimetal- insulator phase transition occurs. Such perturbations in graphene have been widely studied from different perspectives. Instead, the plethora of gap-opening terms in kagome lacks an established classification, and, in most cases, a clear physical interpretation. Recent work however indicates candidate kagome materials as strongly interacting compared to graphene. This suggests that mass terms are more likely to spontaneously originate, motivating interest in this research.
In this work we map the sixteen gap-opening terms of kagome materials into physical effects, leveraging information on the relative broken and preserved symmetries. The general features of kagome instabilities are then discussed with reference to graphene ones, picturing a complex and multifaced relation. The anomalous Hall effect and the spin-Hall effect, originally proposed for the honeycomb lattice, find a prominent host in kagome structures: contrarily to graphene, they are already relevant for nearest-neighbour hoppings, which generally represent the leading contribution. Remarkably, lattice deformation instabilities reflect one property of the model, namely that kagome lattice at 1/3 filling (Dirac points) can be mapped into a dimer model on the hexagonal lattice. Consistently, gap-opening distortions of lattice sites in one structure find a related bond-distortion in the other structure, and viceversa. The staggered, on-site potential which makes graphene an insulator has a dimerization pattern of alternating bonds as the corresponding mass in kagome, and similar mappings are found in more sophisticated distortions as Kekul ́e patterns. Lastly, honeycomb materials are known to have antiferromagnetic instability which leads to a trivial, insulating phase; instead, kagome materials suffer from magnetic frustration. At 1/3 filling however, orderings are possible thanks to the empty sites. Antiferromagnetic phases at the Dirac points are therefore gapped in both materials, with one difference: graphene AFM has a simple magnetic cell, while kagome AFM can be realised with enlarged magnetic cell. In conclusion, the established ground of graphene works as one additional benchmark, giving indications about the relevant instabilities of the two structures."
Inspireren in een digitaal tijdperk: Onderzoek naar de digitale assortimentsgidsen van Albert Heijn.,"['Heinen, Annabel']","['Ouden, Hanny den']",2023-03-07T01:01:20Z,NL,[],Communicatie en Organisatie,"Supermarkt Albert Heijn investeert volop in digitale communicatiemiddelen om op die manier klanten aan zich te binden. Een van die communicatiemiddelen is de digitale assortimentsgids: in de zomer van 2022 creëerde Albert Heijn een nieuwe digitale BBQ-gids die zich met een hoge interactiviteit onderscheidde van voorgaande digitale gidsen met een lage interactiviteit. Functies zoals hyperlinks en aanklikbare knoppen geven klanten controle over de inhoud en maakt een digitale gids interactief. Hoewel de digitale gidsen met lage en hoge interactiviteit een goed verspreidingsplan hebben, maken weinig AH-klanten gebruik van de digitale gidsen. Leeftijd zou hier een rol in kunnen spelen. Bovendien is het onduidelijk in hoeverre klanten door de digitale gidsen geïnspireerd raken om hun boodschappen bij Albert Heijn te kopen en of interactiviteit hier een rol in speelt. 

Dit onderzoek, uitgevoerd in opdracht van Albert Heijn, richt zich op de digitale BBQ-gidsen van Albert Heijn. De focus van het onderzoek ligt op de motieven om een gids wel of niet te gebruiken en op de invloed van interactiviteit en leeftijd. Hierbij zijn twee onderzoeksvragen opgesteld: Waarom lezen Albert Heijn-klanten de assortimentsgids wel of niet digitaal?, en In hoeverre worden mensen door de digitale assortimentsgids met een lage interactiviteit en digitale assortimentsgids met hoge interactiviteit geïnspireerd, en verschilt dit voor jongeren en ouderen?

Om de eerste vraag te beantwoorden is een kwalitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd, waarbij gestructureerde interviews zijn afgenomen onder 31 Albert Heijn-klanten. Uit het resultaat bleek dat klanten een digitale gids voornamelijk gebruiken omdat zij informatie zoeken, zoals recepten of productinformatie. Een veelvoorkomend motief om de gids niet te gebruiken, bleek de benodigde digitale vaardigheden. Deelnemers gaven aan dat zij zich niet digitaal vaardig genoeg voelden om de digitale gids te gebruiken. 

Voor het beantwoorden van de tweede vraag is een online experiment onder 123 deelnemers uitgevoerd. De methode werd toegepast om te onderzoeken of interactiviteit en leeftijd invloed hadden op de mate waarin mensen door de digitale gidsen geïnspireerd werden. De deelnemers werden door middel van opgenomen video´s blootgesteld aan de digitale BBQ-gids met lage of hoge interactiviteit. Zij vulden daarna een aantal vragen in om de mate van inspiratie te meten. Uit het resultaat bleek dat interactiviteit en leeftijd geen invloed hadden.  

Naar aanleiding van dit onderzoek geef ik het volgende advies aan Albert Heijn: blijf naast de papieren assortimentsgids ook investeren in de digitale assortimentsgids om die te blijven ontwikkelen. Uit de interviews kwam namelijk naar voren dat klanten wel degelijk interesse hebben in de digitale gidsen. Om de effectiviteit van de digitale assortimentsgidsen in de toekomst te onderzoeken, zou ik aanbevelen om een complete digitale gids aan deelnemers te tonen waarin zij zelf kunnen bladeren, in plaats van vooraf opgenomen video’s te laten zien. Op die manier kunnen deelnemers de interactiviteit van een gids beter ervaren. Verder zou vervolgonderzoek zich kunnen richten op een digitale assortimentsgids met een ander thema dan BBQ. Albert Heijn maakt naast de BBQ-gids namelijk ook digitale gidsen met andere thema’s, zoals Pasen en Kerst. Het is nu onduidelijk of interactiviteit een rol speelt bij die andere thema’s en het zou daarom interessant zijn om aanvullend onderzoek te doen naar de andere assortimentsgidsen."

In wetenschappelijke literatuur zijn er sterke aanwijzingen gevonden dat de taalontwikkeling van peuters samenhangt met de omgeving waarin zij verkeren. Veel kinderen in Nederland gaan naar voorschoolse voorzieningen, daarom is het van belang om te kijken wat de invloed hiervan kan zijn op de taalontwikkeling. Meer specifiek is er gekeken naar de rol van de educatieve kwaliteit op de taalontwikkeling van een- en meertalige kinderen. Op basis hiervan is de volgende onderzoeksvraag geformuleerd: In hoeverre is de educatieve kwaliteit gerelateerd aan het taalniveau van peuters en wordt deze relatie gemodereerd door meertaligheid?
	Een meervoudige regressieanalyse werd uitgevoerd om de hypothese te toetsen dat taalontwikkeling kan worden beïnvloed door de educatieve kwaliteit en dat meertalige peuters meer baat hebben bij een betere educatieve kwaliteit dan eentalige peuters. De deelnemers waren peuters tussen de leeftijd van 28 en 45 maanden (n = 75). Het aantal eentalige en meertalige peuters was ongeveer gelijk verdeeld.
	In deze studie werd geen significant verband gevonden tussen de educatieve kwaliteit en taalontwikkeling van peuters en ook geen significant moderatie-effect. Wel blijkt dat meertaligheid een effect heeft op de taalontwikkeling: meertalige kinderen hebben een lager taalniveau in het Nederlands dan eentalige kinderen. Op basis hiervan wordt aanbevolen om vervolgonderzoek te doen naar hoe meertalige kinderen optimaal educatief ondersteund kunnen worden, zodat hun taalachterstand verkleind kan worden."
A puzzle to incorporate learnings in a scaling venture builder,"['Longo, Andrea']","['Roelfsema, Hein']",2023-03-07T01:00:53Z,EN,['Learning organization; venture builder; gamification; design thinking'],Science and Business Management,"I ideated a tool that serves to track the switch in the collective knowledge state, and to incentivize the behavioral process that aim to achieve team learning. The solution that I ideated is a gamified knowledge management system named PuzzLearn, which will support the Wiki initiative of the IT team. The tool will allow the learning culture of NLC to self-sustain and grow, similarly to the flywheel effect. The principle of PuzzLearn is that the demand of knowledge creates knowledge itself. The system expects people to collaborate, exchanging knowledge in order to progress with the puzzle. Transferring knowledge with a human (virtual) interaction, the meaningful information discussed are automatically transcribed and stored in the company databases, allowing people to use the knowledge on-demand. The knowledge collected by these interactions will likely be redundant, and the community of users rating the quality of information will help the Wiki selecting what to display to the user’s Wiki-query, combining the most valuable pieces of information.
I believe that NLC will benefit from the adoption of PuzzLearn because it would improve its ability to become sensitive to the ecosystem response. Early sensing capabilities are developed by integrating the feedbacks to actions taken in the venture building process. The integration of feedbacks helps decoding the NLC-ecosystem interaction and allows to adapt and steer. Everyone in the company should not lose the big picture as the organization scales so that all departments are aware of what is needed to reach a meaningful target. This would be ensured by sharing knowledge gained from experience to people who can echo relevant information to the right teams and people."
Timeline designs for 360-degree videos in VR,"['Laudisa, Costanza']","['Hürst, Wolfgang']",2023-03-07T01:01:10Z,EN,['360-degree videos; 360° videos; 360 degree videos; virtual reality; vr; video browsing; timeline; timeline design; timeline navigation;'],Game and Media Technology,"360-degree videos are video recordings that allow the viewer to see in every possible direction at any moment in time, either with 2D devices such as smartphones and computers, or with head-mounted displays. Interaction with such videos can be challenging. For traditional videos, interaction is commonly done by manipulating playback along the timeline, for example, by pausing, rewinding, fast forwarding, or dragging a slider along a horizontal timeline where the left represents the start and the right represents the end of the video. However, in a fully immersive 360-degree setting created with a head-mounted display, there is no ""left"" or ""right"" border, and no upper or lower screen border, making it less obvious where to place a timeline or if such a linear timeline is the most intuitive way for navigating the temporal dimension at all.

Furthermore, 360-degree videos also have a spatial domain, which is why interaction also involves manipulation of the viewing direction, either by manually rotating the video to change the field of view or by turning one’s head into another viewing direction. Especially in the first case, where often horizontal interactions are used, for example by dragging the field of view left or right, this could lead to a conflict with the interaction of a timeline that is also displayed and typically interacted with via horizontal motions.
    
To deal with this conflict, this project investigates timeline designs different than the common horizontal ones and evaluate their advantages and disadvantages in the context of 360-degree videos experienced with head-mounted displays. In particular, the parameters we explore are timeline shape and orientation. Based on a literature study, we select the most promising designs and parameters and evaluate their usefulness for different tasks and contexts in a comparative user study. Results of our study show interesting insights on each timeline design, however participants' answers and feedback still reflected a clear preference for the standard horizontal timeline, even for 360-degree videos in VR."

De illustrator vertelt: boekillustraties in de Hans Christian Andersen-serie (1938-1945) van uitgeverij De Spieghel,"['Tange, Marloes']","['Bavelaar, Hestia']",2023-03-22T01:01:03Z,NL,['kunstgeschiedenis; boekillustratie; literatuurwetenschap; illustratie; De Stijl; Tweede Wereldoorlog; John Rädecker; Dirk Nijland; Charley Toorop; Bart van der Leck; Cornelis Veth; Simon Moulijn; tekst-beeld relaties; illustratiegeschiedenis; Hans Christian Andersen; sprookjes'],Art History,"In deze thesis worden de illustraties bij zes los verschenen verhalen van Hans Christian Andersen
onderzocht die in de jaren dertig en veertig vertaald werden gepubliceerd door uitgeverij N.V. De
Spieghel. De illustraties zijn van de hand van John Rädecker, Dirk Nijland, Charley Toorop, Bart van der
Leck, Cornelis Veth en Simon Moulijn. De afbeeldingen worden gepositioneerd binnen de Nederlandse
illustratiegeschiedenis, en geanalyseerd op basis van hun inhoudelijke, formele en stilistische aspecten.
Hieruit ontstaan zes analyses die inzicht bieden in de verschillende manieren waarop illustratoren zich
kunnen verhouden tot een tekst. Daarbij worden de drie mogelijke tekst-beeldrelaties aangehouden die
Klimowski onderscheidt: reflectief, provocatief of decoratief.

Nijland, Veth en Moulijn reflecteren alle drie vrij letterlijk elementen uit de tekst, maar ze leggen hierbij
andere accenten. Hierdoor creëren ze ieder een eigen visueel narratief dat de tekst aanvult of versterkt.
Die nauwe, reflectieve tekst-beeld relatie wordt extra benadrukt doordat de illustraties zijn
onderschreven met de regels waarnaar ze refereren. Hiermee sluiten deze drie kunstenaars het meeste
aan op traditionele negentiende-eeuwse kenmerken van illustratie. Nijland verbeeldt Het oude huis
(1938) op een nuchtere, feitelijke manier met aandacht voor tijd- en plaatsbepaling. Met zijn formele
keuzes, zoals opvallende perspectiefwerking, zorgt hij voor dramatisch effect. Veths inhoudelijke en
formele keuzes staan in dienst van het uitdrukken van de vermenselijking van een schaduw. Van de zes
illustratoren werkt hij in De schaduw (1942) het meest verhalend, waar zijn ervaring als cartoonist en
spotprentmaker duidelijk uit blijkt. Hij lijkt dan ook het meeste voort te bouwen op de negentiendeeeuwse benadering van illustratie. Moulijn stelt in De spar (1945) de emotionele en fysieke toestand van
een boom centraal, waardoor die een volwaardig personage wordt.

Ook Van der Lecks illustraties in Het vlas (1942) zijn reflectief. De kunstenaar gaat niet alleen te werk als
illustrator, maar als vormgever, waardoor hij de tekst in dienst stelt van het beeld. Hiermee draait hij de
traditionele, ondergeschikte rol van boekillustratie ten opzichte van woorden om, en creëert hij één
visueel geheel.

De illustraties van Rädecker en Toorop sluiten bij geen van Klimowski’s categorieën aan. Ze roepen
associaties op met de tekst, maar zijn maar in zeer selectieve mate echt reflectief. Ze hebben echter ook
geen uitsluitend decoratieve functie. Een vierde categorie van associatieve illustraties zou aan Klimowski’s
tekst-beeld relaties kunnen worden toegevoegd om hun afbeeldingen onder te brengen. Rädecker lijkt in
De wind vertelt van Valdemar Daae en zijn dochters (1938) vooral een bepaalde sfeer te willen
overdragen, wat kenmerkend was voor Franse illustratoren die werkzaam waren in het interbellum.
Toorops intenties zijn minder duidelijk, en haar illustraties in De familie van Grethe het kippenvrouwtje
(1939) sluiten dan ook niet duidelijk aan op bestaande illustratietradities. Beide illustratoren lijken vooral
de verbeelding van de lezer te willen stimuleren, en laten zich leiden door persoonlijke esthetische
overwegingen."
Coproduceren rondom de gaswinning: een (on)mogelijke opgave?,"['Jorna, Floortje']","['Grimmelikhuijsen, S.G.']",2023-03-21T01:01:03Z,NL,['Coproductie; cocreatie; publiek management; bestuurskunde'],Publiek management,"De gaswinning in Groningen is van een “sprookje” uitgelopen in een vertrouwenscrisis. Er zijn meerdere pogingen gedaan om de situatie te verbeteren, door partijen uit de regio te betrekken bij de veranderingen in de gaswinning en in de benadering van de gevolgen ervan. Om te analyseren wat voor soort betrokkenheid van waarde is bij een publieke dienst als de gaswinning, biedt het concept coproductie een relevant perspectief.

Coproductie betreft in haar algemeenheid activiteiten die reguliere dienstverleners zoals de overheid en niet-overheidsactoren samen ondernemen, zodat zij tezamen bijdragen aan voordelen voor de publieke dienstverlening. Inzichten over coproductie zijn bij uitstek relevant op gebied van de gaswinning, aangezien het mogelijk vertrouwen in de overheid bevordert. Ondanks de mogelijke relevantie van coproductie, is kennis over het concept beperkt. Het staat bekend als vertroebeld concept, is weinig onderzocht op gebied van onderdelen van de energievoorziening en eenduidige bevindingen over het verband met het vertrouwen in de overheid blijven uit. Daarom staat de volgende onderzoeksvraag in dit onderzoek centraal:
“Wat is het verband tussen de soorten coproductie en het vertrouwen in de overheid, op gebied de gaswinning in Groningen?”

In dit onderzoek is de soort coproductie gedefinieerd, middels een duiding van coproductiefases en –niveaus. Daarmee kon achterhaald worden bij welke fase in de dienstverlening de actor betrokken is, alsook hoeveel invloed degene daar heeft. Ook werd hen gevraagd naar het vertrouwen dat zij in het verantwoordelijke ministerie ervaren. In totaal zijn vijftien interviews afgenomen, met verschillende partijen die een relatie hebben tot de gaswinning of de gevolgen ervan.

Op basis van dit onderzoek kunnen twee conclusies worden getrokken. Ten eerste kan geconcludeerd worden dat dit onderzoek een kleinschalig inzicht geeft in het verband tussen soorten coproductie en het vertrouwen in de overheid. Van de soorten coproductie blijkt coproductie in de fase van planontwikkeling en ontwerpen direct verband te houden met het vertrouwen, waarbij het coproductieniveau zich positief verhoudt tot tot de mate waarin actoren de overheid vertrouwen. Daar waar in de fase van planontwikkeling of ontwerpen een laag coproductieniveau bestaat, wordt het vertrouwen als laag ervaren. Ook geldt dat daar waar in deze fases een hoger coproductieniveau bestaat, zich een neutraal tot positief vertrouwen wordt ervaren. Ten tweede constateert dit onderzoek dat coproductie niet zozeer bestaat op gebied van de gaswinning als dienstverlening, maar op gebied van de gevolgen ervan.

Aanbevelingen voor de wetenschap richten zich op het uitbreiden van kennis over coproductie en het verband met vertrouwen in de overheid, op gebied van de gaswinning, andere mijnbouwactiviteiten en meer algemene publieke dienstverlening. Dit vraagt om kwalitatief onderzoek, zodat kwantitatief en experimenteel onderzoek beter aan te sluiten op de specifieke context waar coproductie bestaat en deze methoden bijdragen aan de kennisontwikkeling op grote, systematische schaal. Een aanbeveling voor de praktijk is het inzetten van coproductie in de fases van planontwikkeling en ontwerpen, waarbij de invloed van actoren in ieder geval gelijk dient te blijven en waar relevant ook vergroot. Daarbij zijn de andere aanbevelingen relevant, die zich richten op het minderen van de overdaad aan beleid en het maken van duidelijke afspraken over de manier waarop partijen betrokken zijn."

The Dialogue has recently been rediscovered by historians as a crucial moment in the present neoliberal order’s creation, a time when imagining new ways of global organisation appeared possible. The historical literature has only lately begun dealing with how this possibility became scuttled between 1975 and 1981. This scholarship has however largely neglected to assess how bilateral relations between Northern and Southern states were affected by this process, thereby not depicting the Dialogue’s true significance. The following thesis begins to do this by examining how the North-South Dialogue shaped the Carter administration’s foreign policy towards Mexico. This is done through a digital archival research method and the application of the antipreneur theory. It is found that the Dialogue moulded the Carter administration’s foreign policy towards Mexico by pushing Washington to offer monetary services and technological goods to Mexico City, by driving it to directly convince its southern neighbour of its global economic governance norms, and by propelling it to attempt to move Mexico into particular enterprises to shift the terms of the North-South Dialogue. However, it is also shown that Mexico’s tremendous size and proximity created other extraneous interests in the White House which simultaneously also motivated much of the above to different extents. This signifies that although the Dialogue was important to bilateral policy in this instance, that importance varied from measure-to-measure."
Improved diffusion MRI with an ultra-strong gradient head insert,"['Marc, Flavius']","['Tax, Chantal']",2023-03-21T01:00:58Z,EN,"['demyelination, myelin water, diffusion MRI, diffusion weighting, preprocessing, artifacts, gradient coil, insert, 7T, magnetic force, dynamic field camera, B matrix']",Medical Imaging,"Demyelination and dysmyelination diseases cause damage to the white matter in the central nervous system by disrupting the myelin water sheaths on axons. Diffusion MRI has been suggested to be crucial in uncovering microstructural alterations in white matter. However, conventional diffusion MRI methods are unable to detect myelin water due to its short transverse relaxation time (T2). The use of ultra-strong gradients can significantly shorten the echo time thereby regaining sensitivity to myelin water, but presents technical difficulties including expensive setup and risk of peripheral nerve stimulation. In this work, the potential of using a gradient insert that can be interfaced with existing scanners is assessed to boost diffusion MRI experiments. First, the magnetic force experienced by the cables that supply power to the coil had to be reduced to enable strong diffusion weightings. An optimal cable configuration for the gradient insert coil is presented along with a proposed mechanical design to reduce the magnetic force on cables. This enabled the acquisition of healthy human brain images with strong diffusion weightings. Next, a preprocessing pipeline was developed to address deviations from the imposed diffusion weighting resulting from nonlinearities in the ultra-strong coil's magnetic field, and to correct image distortions resulting from linear eddy currents and susceptibility fields. Finally, the feasibility of quantifying myelin water diffusion with the gradient insert was investigated in simulations."

The development of a Pt-Sn/Al2O3 model catalytic system to study the in situ conversion of CO to CO2 using SHINERS,"['Zijlstra, Douwe']","['Vogt, E.T.C.']",2023-04-01T00:01:22Z,EN,[],Nanomaterials Science,"Diesel Oxidation Catalysts (DOC’s) are Pt-based catalysts that are known to convert toxic exhaust gases, such as CO, into the less harmful CO2 at 250 °C. At lower temperatures, the surface of the DOC is adsorbed with only CO, resulting in poisoning of the system. One solution to counter the poisoning, is to increase the temperature. This results in a more easily desorption of CO, to create more active sites for the adsorption of O2. However, advancements in technology (such as hybrid cars), have led to a decrease in the average temperature at which exhaust gases are released. This results in the lose of efficiency of the DOC’s and resulting in a poisoning of CO on the surface. Therefore, a new model catalytic system must be developed to facilitate CO oxidation at a lower temperature without the chance for CO poisoning. This could be achieved by adding a promotor element such as tin (Sn).
First in this study, catalytic powder samples were analyzed using operando Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), to observe if Sn has a promoting effect. Then, the CO oxidation reaction was monitored using Shell-Isolated Nanoparticle Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SHINERS), a gold core with a protective layer to amplify the Raman signal. A platinum- (Pt) and a Pt-Sn layer were used to protect the gold core to examine the effect of Sn as a promotor element on the CO oxidation reaction. Besides that, an alumina coating was also applied using the ALD-method to assess its effect on the CO oxidation reaction. 
The results of the operando DRIFTS show a promoting effect of Sn on the decrease in initial CO oxidation temperature, 139 °C compared with 172 °C for the catalyst without Sn. The results of the operando Raman Spectroscopy also show a promoting effect of Sn on lowering the initial CO oxidation temperature, 195 °C compared with 215 °C for the catalyst without Sn. However, the formation of a core-shell structure was not observed with TEM and SEM-EDX analysis. In the TEM-image of the system with Sn, a grey spot was found next to the nanoparticles, which can be attributed to a metallic state of Sn. Besides that, the adsorption of CO was observed at higher temperatures for the catalyst with Sn compared without Sn. This is contradicted to the promoting effect of Sn on the initial CO oxidation temperature because if CO2 is formed at a lower temperature, CO should desorb more easily at a lower temperature, which is not observed. Finally, the promoting effect of Sn decreases as the thickness of the Al2O3-coating increases. A coating of 1.4 nm shows a promoting effect with Sn, but a coating of 2.8 nm does not.
In conclusion, Sn shows a promoting effect on decreasing the initial CO oxidation temperature in both operando Raman Spectroscopy as operando DRIFTS, even though the core-shell structure has not been observed. However, to protect the Au core and therefore the enhancement of the Raman signal, it is important to have a shell around the core. Therefore, more research needs to be done to optimize the synthesis method such as the use of different ratio concentrations Pt-and Sn-precursors. Additional information could also be obtained using techniques such as TEM-EDX or ICP element analysis."
Do-it-yourself greening: Interaction between municipal authorities and community-led initiatives for urban green spaces,"['Jongh, Cathy de']","['Bulkeley, Harriet']",2023-04-03T00:00:47Z,EN,['NBS; urban green spaces; municipalities; Netherlands; community-led initiatives; Policy Arrangement Approach; reflexivity; boundary spanners; case studies;'],Sustainable Development,"The effects of urbanisation and climate change have increased the focus of urban policymakers on sustainability. Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) are increasingly implemented as a means to achieve sustainability, through their versatility and provision of services to urban inhabitants. One way of implementing NBS is through urban green spaces such as parks and street trees, which can be adapted to their surroundings and benefit actors in the surrounding areas. From among these actors, the involvement of citizens can particularly benefit urban green spaces through the governance form of community-led initiatives (CLI). Such initiatives are both initiated and governed by citizens who decide upon its goals, resource use and activities. They are not independent, as municipalities interact with green space CLIs in various ways and thereby affect their success. However, current literature mainly focuses on municipal facilitation rather than mutual interaction, and uses case studies from large municipalities. Therefore, this thesis asks the question: How, why, and with what implications do municipalities enable and constrain urban green space CLIs through their interaction?

This research question is examined using an analytical framework adapted from the Policy Arrangement Approach by Arts et al. (2006) combined with literature concerning interaction of municipalities with NBS and CLI. Data was collected from the Dutch municipalities of Culemborg and Wageningen, with green space CLIs selected on contrasting green spaces and activities, to map diverse interaction dynamics. The research uses a case study approach with data from interviews and documentation, coded according to the framework.

This research found that municipalities and green space CLIs interact through the reflexive provision of resources and rules, with municipal employees working as boundary spanners to translate and navigate between actors. Formalization to obtain resources, emphasis on policy uses of CLI, and the importance of steady points of contact are acknowledged by both actors. The presence of municipal employees or other coordinating individuals enables reflexive collaboration and accommodation for both actors. The research shows that while resources provided by public actors and within green space CLIs are important, reflexivity is a key dimension for interaction by smoothing over existing obstacles within the policy landscape. While the research focuses on municipalities, other public actors are revealed to be important through their various responsibilities and capacities as they take on a similar role for green space CLIs in the absence of municipal involvement."

PEB was assessed by means of three constructs: picky eating (PE), PEB frequently associated with autistic traits, and Avoidant/Restrictive Foot Intake Disorder (ARFID). These PEB constructs were assessed by means of self-report questionnaires (APEQ, SWEEA, NIAS). Results showed that autistic traits was a significant predictor for PE and PEB frequently associated with autistic traits, but not ARFID. CI was a significant predictor for all three PEB measures, and autistic traits and CI were positively associated. Further, CI did not enhance the effect of autistic traits on PEB. In conclusion, autistic traits and CI both seem to predict the level of PEB in women. Autistic traits and CI are associated, however, it is still unclear which forms and components of CI relate to the sub-traits of autism. Future research needs to develop and use diagnostic tools that are based on the female autistic phenotype in order to investigate the relationship between autistic traits and PEB in women."

Objectives → With this research, the aim is to develop a secure digital transformation framework that helps organizations to decide the degree of cyber security controls which have to be implemented to  find the most optimal level of cyber security in the organization and define a basic security baseline when situated in different phases of a digital transformation. 
Methods → This thesis consists of multiple steps. A multivocal literature review is conducted to (1) create a definition for digital transformation, (2) create a digital transformation phases model, and (3) define cybersecurity for digital transformation. Expert interviews are conducted to (4) collect the most relevant current cyber security risks. A focus group with experts from practice is organized to (5) prioritize the risk in different phases of digital transformation. With this information, (6) the secure digital transformation framework is created. To validate this framework, (7) a cyber security assessment is conducted in the form of an interview.
Results → The cyber security assessment showed that the SDX framework could be used to measure an organization's cyber security in a DX. However, it is important to note that the SDX framework should be validated in different stages of a digital transformation and with different types of organizations to ensure its applicability and generalizability.
Conclusion → Overall, this research provides valuable insights for organizations looking to navigate the landscape of DX and cyber security."
Development of HER2-Targeted Theranostics for Diagnosis and Treatment of Breast Cancer,"['Hu, Yijun']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-04-03T00:00:42Z,EN,"['breast cancer, HER2, peptides, peptide synthesis, ligand-receptor binding, surface plasmon resonance, binding assay']",Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"A library of peptides targeting HER2 was established from in silico docking analysis of a pool of over 8000 preliminary sequences based on a recently developed anti-HER2 peptide KSPNPRF. The library has been synthesized by solid-phase Fmoc protocol and evaluated for their binding affinities. The peptides have a common core sequence, PNP, flanked by various amino acids and conjugated to a Cy5.5 fluorescent dye via a PEG4-K linker. Six peptides of this library have been evaluated by a magnetic beads-based fluorescence binding assay and compared to the reference KSPNPRF and a scrambled control peptide developed by the same group. With this assay, we found a KD of 49 nM for the reference, while the affinities of the six peptides of the library ranged from ~40 nM to ~2 μM. However due to the ambiguity of the data analysis, these values need to be further validated. We also report the development of a surface plasmon resonance protocol to evaluate the peptide library. For this, we have immobilised biotinylated HER2 on a streptavidin-coated chip and assessed the effect of the protein type, sensor chip, and regeneration conditions on the quality of the measurements of the KSP*, scrambled control peptide and Herceptin. While the SPR signal is sufficient, further investigations are needed to reduce non-specific binding and improve the signal quality."
Data-driven approach for body motion retargeting,"['Lasdas, Vasilis']","['Yumak, Z.']",2023-04-02T23:01:06Z,EN,['motion retargeting; animated characters; transformers; intra/cross-structure retargeting'],Artificial Intelligence,"Motion retargeting(MR) deals with the problem of adapting the motion of one articulated animated character to another, potentially with different skeletal structure, like different bone lengths, or a completely different topology. Clearly, the animation and video-game industry would be highly benefited by the existence of such an automated tool. In this thesis, we introduce a novel neural architecture using transformers as the building block. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs transformers for MR.  Similar work uses either RNN, CNN or temporal CNN. Additionally, by manipulating the skeletal graph, we propose a simple technique for seamless retargeting between skeletons with different number of joints, thus handling intra and cross-structure retargeting in a unified way. The system produces excellent results for intra-structure retargeting, and decent results for cross-structure retargeting, while succeeding in maintaining the original motion content. Finally, the approach is extensible to any number of datasets and any number of character joints."

On the role of coastal birds in ecopote evolution of the Wadden Sea Islands","['Guseva, Polina']","['Reijers, Valérie']",2023-04-05T00:01:01Z,EN,['Wadden Sea; avian pump; avian nutrient pump; soft-substrate islands development; sediment accumulation; vegetation-sedimentation feedback; biogeomorphic feedback; ecotopes; bird effect; nutrient transfer; guano'],Marine Sciences,"The Wadden Sea is a unique ecosystem and a very significant breeding, roosting, and migratory area for birds. Moreover, it protects the Netherlands from storms and the rising ocean. Due to the dynamic nature of local islands, it is important to find a key to natural preservation and sediment accumulation. Previous research showed that bird presence affects ecosystem productivity on hard-substrate islands via allochthonous nutrient transfer (guano, dead bodies) and physical disturbance (seed dispersal). At the same time, vegetation stimulates sediment accretion. However, how soft-substrate islands are shaped through bird-affected plant growth is not well studied, while the feedback between vegetation presence and sediment dynamics exists.
To reveal the influence on vegetation and sediment around, environmental characteristics are tracked within the timeline of 2017-2022 in the Dutch Wadden Sea within and outside of 61 avian colonies in a total of 9 different species. Based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and digital elevation maps (DEMs), four parameters are comprised: mean summer NDVI as a proxy for the amount of vegetation, a linear coefficient of spring greening (greening index) for noting the slope of vegetation increase, total elevation is taken as stated in DEMs, and an absolute maximum of space slope represents steepness. Eventually, all possible combinations of these characteristics are broken down into groups and 32 clusters are composed to reflect ecotopes. To demonstrate the evolution, a linear annual coefficient of continuous data and variability of categorical data are compared between groups and per island.
Overall, birds prefer highly vegetated places which green over spring with gently or not inclined low terrains and the clusters corresponding to these attributes. These distributions correspond with species’ habitat prefer- ences. Over the years, mean NDVI and greening index increase faster within avian colonies than outside while in general there is no significant common trend for elevation or slope changes. Random forest classification also stresses the importance of vegetation parameters for bird prediction. However, the tendency is clearer if considered per island.
The stage of island development defines the magnitude and direction of the bird effect. Islands in the bio-morphological stage are susceptible to the nutrient pump as both elevation and vegetation are increasing. Whereas, on islands in the ecological stage summer mean NDVI is growing even faster but without any effect on abiotic parameters. Cluster variability also reflects these stages, where on the first kind of islands birds dwell on more dynamic territories in comparison to the outside. While both groups transition from unvegetated areas to vegetated ones, birds boost this shift. Whereas, on islands undergoing succession birds are located in more stable places in comparison to the surrounding."
Drug design with improved MM-PBSA: tackling the entropy problem,"['Bijkerk, Simon']","['Bonvin, Alexandre']",2023-04-05T10:00:41Z,EN,['MM-PBSA; MM-GBSA; entropy; NMA; QHA; binding free energy;'],Drug Innovation,"Small molecules intended as active ingredient in drugs usually bind proteins to assert their effect. Of course, side-effects occur for any drug, and lowering the dose used usually lowers side effects. Therefore, for designing drugs, it is crucial to find a compound that requires a low dose to assert its desired effect. The dose that can be used, depends on how strong the drug binds the target protein. Therefore, it is crucial to find strongly binding compounds. Since physically synthesizing all compounds considered would be resource and time intensive, methods to predict binding strength with computers can save lots of time and resources. Only the few compounds that bind strongest according to the predictions would have to be synthesized and tested. 
One computational method for estimating binding strength with intermediate speed and accuracy, is called molecular-mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann surface accessible (MM-PBSA). This method considers some enthalpic terms that increase binding strength, such as electric attraction between drug and protein, and it has an entropy term, which reflects the energy cost of lost drug- and protein flexibility once they bind to each other. 
However, the enthalpic terms are way faster to calculate than the entropy term. Additionally, when comparing two similarly shaped drug-candidate molecules, which bind to the protein in the same way, the entropy term is often similar. Therefore, reasonably predictions of relative binding strength have been obtained by using MM-PBSA on similar drug molecules binding to the same protein, while ignoring the entropy term.
Because drug candidates are not always similar, and the entropy term in MM-PBSA is not always similar for these candidates, it remains important to find methods that can estimate the entropy without slowing MM-PBSA too much, while improving its accuracy.
In this literature review, several historical and new methods for entropy estimation are explained and discussed. Benefits and limitations are listed for each method. Since each method makes different assumptions to speed up calculation, which may be applicable in some cases, but not all, it is listed what the most appropriate use-case would be for each method. The main conclusion is that there are many promising methods, but some require excessive amounts of simulations of protein and ligand to reach accurate entropy estimates. Only when computational resources would increase, would they be useable with MM-PBSA for investigating drug-protein binding. The most promising method is the interaction-entropy method. It is very fast to calculate, while it only relies on the same assumptions frequently used in MM-PBSA calculations. Furthermore, it has been proven to improve MM-PBSA predictions on average, even when including protein-drug couples that do not fall within its ideal use-case. Finally, although several separate methods exist that are compatible with MM-PBSA, only limited performance comparisons in terms of accuracy and speed are available. It is therefore too early to tell which method should become the new standard for use with MM-PBSA, or to draw definite conclusions regarding the most applicable method for a given use-case. Nevertheless, we hope that this review can guide fellow scientists in choosing an entropy method for use with MM-PBSA."

More specifically, this research explores how sexual scripts (e.g. acquired ‘guidelines’ for sexual behavior) are embedded within heteronormative and gendered frameworks, how these scripts influence and/or guide the sexual experiences of plurisexual individuals, and how a ‘queer’ perspective fits in envisioning sexual futures. As part of the theoretical framework, I use an interdisciplinary approach by drawing upon various theories from social psychology, sex research, feminist theory, and queer theory. For example, I discuss Simon and Gagnon’s Sexual Script Theory, Butler’s theory of Gender Performativity, Halberstam’s work on the Queer Art of Failure, Preciado’s Countersexual Manifesto, and Muñoz’s work Cruising Utopia. Additionally, to explore how plurisexual individuals navigate heteronormative and gendered sexual scripts in various gender relations, I conducted 13 semi-structured in-depth interviews with plurisexual young adults (aged 21-29) from the Netherlands. The findings of this research suggest that plurisexual individuals navigate heteronormative and gendered sexual scripts in varied ways, in which heteronormative and gendered sexual scripts are sometimes reproduced and other times deconstructed. Moreover, the findings propose a potential for ‘queering’ heteronormative ways of ‘doing gender’ during sex that possibly paves the way for more sexual freedom. With the findings of this research, I hope to open up the conversation about the complexities of navigating sex. By staying with these complexities, I envision a world where sex becomes more pleasurable and free."

At six and ten weeks postpartum, both parental stress and experienced problems with infant crying were measured. At six weeks postpartum, the duration of crying was measured through an infant behaviour diary. Multiple regression analysis showed: (1) a relationship between whining at six weeks postpartum and maternal stress at 10 weeks postpartum; (2) a relationship between experiencing infant crying as more problematic at ten weeks postpartum and parental stress; (3) the psychoeducational intervention offered did not appear to have a moderating role. An implication of the current study is the inclusion of information on the effects of different types of crying on the development of parental stress."

It plays a role in maintaining homeostasis, embryonic development, tissue repair and was recently established to influence tumorigenesis as well. In this process, neighbouring cells within a tissue compare cellular fitness through both direct and indirect interactions, that result in the elimination of the least fit cell population. As a consequence, the fittest cells remain and take over the tissue, thereby ensuring tissue quality. This review discusses recent insights of cell competition in mammals, shedding a light on the signalling pathways involved in this process and illuminating the role of cell competition as both a tumour-suppressing, and a tumour-promoting mechanism."

"Transport poverty in Haarlemmermeer and Zoetermeer, the Netherlands: the 'inside versus outside perspective' of reality?","['Goossens, Janneke']","['Witte, Patrick']",2023-04-12T00:00:45Z,EN,['transport poverty;perspectives;qualitative;perception;suburban;gender;indicator;mobility;well-being;social exclusion'],Spatial Planning,"Transport poverty (TP) negatively impacts an individual’s ability to participate in society, making it a socially relevant issue regarding which further research is needed. Despite their relevance, ‘transport poor’ are often not visible as such in the statistics. The issue is multi-faceted, as its causes and consequences can lie within and beyond the mobility domain.
In the Netherlands, the scientific as well as the political world are still exploring TP as of now. Research on the matter only started to be systematically conducted just over ten years ago. There is no clear view yet of how and where TP manifests in the Netherlands. This makes it hard for governments and authorities to create workable, effective policies on it. In 2019, the Dutch national statistics and environmental assessment agency formulated an indicator ‘risk of TP’, aiming to give a first insight to the issue. However, this indicator does not include individual experience and local context, although both are important to TP.

Therefore, the main objective of this research is to juxtapose the reality of TP the way experts and government officials perceive it, with the experienced dimension on the part of individuals. The research group concerns persons who are arguably at risk of TP according to the CBS/PBL risk indicator. And, as women’s mobility patterns and experiences differ from men’s; job status has shown to be influential on TP; and suburban regions in the Netherlands have not been researched as much as the biggest cities or rural areas have, this specific ‘niche’ group was selected: women with a distance to the labour market (non-working; no full-time, paid job), living in suburban municipalities in the Netherlands. The main question is thus as follows:
“To what extent are the perceived and experienced reality of the risk of transport poverty of nonworking women, living in Haarlemmermeer or Zoetermeer, consistent?”

Firstly, the notion of ‘risk of TP’ and currently relevant policies on the topic were explored by expert interviews and desk research. The (policy) desk research was in addition to the local and regional government interviews that were conducted to investigate the current attitudes of (governmental) authorities on the issue. Then, importantly, in-depth interviews followed with the target group: non-working women in suburban Dutch areas. Using the NVP database, the sample was selected on the aforementioned characteristics (N=15), and (after sample validation) approached to participate. Interviewees (n=6) were asked about experiences regarding living environment, mobility situation, and capabilities.

However there is some variation in the perception of TP, the general understanding of the issue was found to be somewhat similar between the in- and outside view. The risk indicator was a good enough ‘lens’ as a means to find people who are vulnerable– but it does not tell the full story. In practice, the navigation of either perspective showed a need for action. An institutional culture may be needed, to finetune policies to people’s needs. Governments ought to keep in contact with their people and the local context. Most importantly through research- and policy actions on TP; and listening to the people’s voices, enabling policy- and decision makers to place oneself in others’ shoes.
Future research could explore different sample (sources) -in order to gather people who are more atrisk of TP than the sample of this study; and specific research methods -in order to test the perception of transport poverty on other groups- whilst using a similar set-up as this study."

Especially adopted by private companies, hundreds of SCS have been developed to address a multitude of sustainability-related issues as a result of contemporary economic and industrial activities. As SCS have been found useful tools to both address sustainability issues by companies while demonstrating the efforts made to address them, this has created a worrying trend of proliferation, leading to many duplications and race to the bottom. Following this concerns, this research aims to assist  academics and practitioners to navigate between more desirable SCS with the aim of advancing sustainable development. Specifically, the research aims to understand the condition of which SCS are deemed more effective in fostering sustainability governance amongst companies. The methodology of this study started by performing an extensive literature review on the theoretical effective governance of SCS. The relevant literature has been captured into a theoretical framework for evaluating these conditions for effective governance. The framework contains the following conditions: 1) Sustainability dimensions, 2) Stringency of the standards, 3) Quality of the audit, 4) Accountability and Transparency, 5) Stakeholder participation and decision-making procedures, 6) Distributive equity, 7) Uptake. The framework has been applied on non-industry specific SCS, referring to standards that can be adopted by all types of companies. Two different but comparable cases have been chosen for this comparative study. The B Corp standard and ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System (EMS). The findings show inconclusive results in terms of effectiveness. Both cases present generally high qualitative score for effectiveness. Especially ISO 14001:2015 performs well in terms of its rigour of its requirements and audits, with high transparency and accountability, and superior uptake. Both cases show high performance for addressing high-quality decision-making. In terms of notable shortcoming, both cases seem to not address the distribution of costs and benefits of stakeholders. Finally, ISO 14001 is limited in its scope as it only addressed environmental-sustainability. Important findings reveal the importance of interlinkages and trade-offs between the standard, which have been discussed shortly. Future research addressing the complexity of interactions between conditions for effective governance will be valuable contribution to this field of research. Finally, there is a growing need to better understanding non-industry specific standards, such as two cases, as viable game changers in sustainability governance and their role accelerating sustainable market transformation."
Assessment of the decreasing suspended sediment concentrations in the Rhine River using the Google Earth Engine,"['Sloot, Stef']","['Perk, Marcel van der']",2023-04-06T00:00:50Z,EN,['Rhine River; Neckar River; Moselle River; Main River; Landsat collection; Sentinel collection; Suspended sediment concentration; Google Earth Engine'],Earth Surface and Water,"Suspended sediment transport plays a crucial role in river systems. Human influences have strongly altered river systems around the world causing a strong decline in the suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) and loads. This decline has led or may lead to insufficient sediment supply to compensate for sea level rise and, consequently, to increased land subsidence or loss of coastal land. Knowing the origin of this decline is important for the implementation of effective management strategies. This study explores the capabilities of remote sensing tools to identify the decline of the SSC in the Rhine River and its major tributaries from 1990-present. Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE), an SSC model  for both the Landsat and Sentinel image collection was developed. These models were calibrated using SSC measurements at in-situ locations. Based on the available observations of the Sentinel and Landsat image collections, no significant trend could be observed. Observations from the Sentinel model showed a gradual downstream increasing trend in SSC. It also showed a higher resemblance to the in-situ measurements in comparison to the Landsat model. The period (2017-2022) of data availability from the Sentinel model was too short to observe any clear temporal trend. The Landsat model had a longer period (1990-2022) of data availability, but it performed poorly in observing low sediment concentration events and underestimated the high events. Therefore, the Landsat model was unable to show any clear SSC trends. It is advisable to use fitted models for the Upper-Rhine, Mid-Rhine, Lower-Rhine, and each tributary separately. This improves the reliability of the SSC predictions at each section of the Rhine. To do so, more consistent and up to date in-situ data is needed for the calibration. Future SSC studies of the Rhine River would benefit most from the use of the Sentinel image collection as the increased resolution of 10mx10m and the use of the Red Edge1 band resulted in a better prediction of the SSC in comparison to the Landsat model."

How fascism runs rampant in the playgrounds of todays algorithms,"['Cornelisse, Daphne']","['Schie, Gerwin van']",2023-04-06T00:00:58Z,EN,['algorithms; fascism; populism; digital culture; twitter; forum for democracy'],New Media and Digital Culture,"Historians say that the current era facilitates new forms of fascism. Fascist techniques correspond to the operation of social media algorithms: reinforcing fears, spreading ‘alternative truths’ and the logic of numbers (the fact that many people say it, makes it true). Therefore, a new perspective on fascism is needed because, in their view, digital fascism is built primarily on digital (hate) cultures. That is why this paper introduces a new concept: algorithmic fascism. This is explained using the tweets posted from January to November 2022 by Forum for Democracy’s MPs and by that party’s account. Those tweets are analyzed through social media critical discourse analysis, split into content and usage analysis. The content analysis looks at what is written, said or seen in a post, a usage analysis looks at how a medium and its affordances are used. The analysis shows that the content of the tweets and the way the medium is used by the six accounts studied together, show great similarities to how experts describe modern (digital) fascism. However, this is not the case for the accounts separately: each account exhibits some of the characteristics. This is what makes the term algorithmic fascism relevant, because through the platform’s algorithms, not all accounts have to exhibit every element to show users the overall picture. When Twitter accounts work together, for example by regularly mentioning, retweeting or responding to each other, an algorithm places them in the same group, which means users do not have to follow all accounts to still receive every element. This study therefore recommends that when examining the far right and fascism on social media, groups or networks should be examined rather than individual accounts. It is important to consider that this study did not include all accounts of all Forum for Democracy representatives: thus, the conclusions are also not representative of the party as a whole. This could be expanded in follow-up research. A comparison with other parties is also interesting, as is the use of other social media platforms, in order to make a broader statement about algorithmic fascism."

De ervaring met online onderwijs hangt voor studenten met een beperking samen met het type beperking, de beleving van bijkomende stressoren en de kwaliteit en toegankelijkheid van het onderwijsaanbod. Online onderwijs blijkt mogelijkheden te bieden in de weg naar inclusief onderwijs als het kwalitatief, toegankelijk en optioneel is. Hieruit kan geconcludeerd worden dat een kwalitatieve en goed doordachte inzet van online onderwijs bij zou kunnen dragen aan de invulling van de criteria voor inclusief onderwijs volgens het VN-Verdrag Handicap."
Decoding Attended and Unattended Visual Information in Visual Working Memory,"['Ruijs, Femke']","['Gayet, Surya']",2023-04-12T00:00:49Z,EN,['visual working memory; AMI; UMI; item relevance; visual information decoding; attended; unattended'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Visual items held in visual working memory (VWM) can be currently or prospectively relevant. Currently relevant items (attended) are memory items that are currently necessary to perform a certain task. Prospectively relevant (unattended) items are not currently necessary to perform a task, but could become relevant later on. Some studies suggest that these attended and unattended memory items can be stored in different brain regions, or even in different formats. However, research is inconclusive about where and how these differences exist across the cortex. In this study we aimed to get insight into where and how the brain distributes neural resources to store attended and unattended visual information. We collected 7T fMRI neural data from three participants as they performed a visual working memory task. This task was designed so that in our relevant measuring delay, a partcipant stored both an attended and an unattended visual item (a grated orientation) in visual working memory. Then, using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, we decoded attended and unattended visual information from the cortex. We were able to decode attended visual information from parietal, occipital and frontal regions. We were also able to decode unattended visual information in one participant from parietal and occipital regions. Furthermore, we found that attended visual information is represented more strongly in the occipital lobe than unattended visual information. We conclude that while attended and unattended visual information can be stored in similar brain regions, attended visual information is represented more strongly in the occipital lobe, where the visual cortex is located. We hypothesise that the brain could distribute more neural resources from the visual cortex to store attended visual items, as this brain region is capable of storing this information in a high-resolution format. This would thus facilitate tasks such as search, as a more high-resolution memory representation can be used to match to the visual input from our environment. Finally, we highlight benefit of using 7T fMRI and within-subject statistics with many trials per participant in decoding visual information from visual working memory."

"3D GIS distribution network of Brabant Water -
Possibilities for spatial decision support","['Beukel, Sibe van den']","['Verbree, Edward']",2023-05-02T00:01:13Z,EN,"['Augmented Reality, 3D GIS, Underground Utility Networks, GNSS, Drinking Water Distribution System']",Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"This research is focused on evaluating the potential value and benefits of transforming the Drinking Water Distribution System (DWDS) of Brabant Water from a traditional two-dimensional (2D) Geographical Information System (GIS) to a cutting-edge three-dimensional (3D) GIS in which Z coordinates are stored and maintained. The objective is to examine the possibilities of using 3D GIS with a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) for more effective analysis and visualization. 

The study is explicitly conducted for Brabant Water and is publicly accessible, although confidential data is not disclosed. The primary research question is ‘’How can the drinking water distribution system of Brabant Water be transformed from a two-dimensional to a three-dimensional geographical information system, and what are the possibilities of spatial decision support system usage for Brabant Water?’’ 

The research explains the accuracy of depth measurement and the regulations surrounding excavation work in the Netherlands, including the WIBON law and CROW500 publication. With excavation work on the rise, the number of damages to underground infrastructure has also increased, and therefore Brabant Water would like to minimize damage to its water networks. 

Despite the potential benefits of switching to a 3D GIS environment, Brabant Water faces several limitations, such as data quality, verifying depth information, possible deviations in-depth, obtaining data for new pipes, and decreased performance due to increased data usage and computing power. Nevertheless, the benefits of the transformation to a 3D GIS include more accurate analysis, improved communication and collaboration, and the ability to make more extensive geospatial analyses like the relationship between water temperature and soil temperature, which can be calculated by knowing the depth of the DWDS.
 
The growing volume of big geospatial data from sources like Global Positioning Systems (GPS), smartphones, and Internet of Things (IoT) creates a significant challenge in obtaining valuable insights. However, SDSS and Mixed Reality (MR) technologies like Augmented Reality (AR) in relation to 3D GIS can provide a solution to this challenge. AR and 3D GIS can be utilized by field workers to examine complex underground infrastructure, outage management, and maintain the DWDS. 

Brabant Water is considering requiring contractors to report Z coordinates to enhance data quality. More measured Z coordinates also contribute to a reliable future digital twin. The analysis will consist of five Models using datasets such as the DWDS, Dutch opensource elevation data of the ground surface (AHN4), and measured Z coordinates. The output will be a comprehensive data model with a field for tracking measurement methods and storing Z coordinates for depth and surface level and the difference between the two. The Z coordinate measurement data will be merged with the AHN4 to create a comprehensive Z coordinate DWDS dataset. 

The ultimate goal of the study is to create a complete dataset with Z coordinates for Brabant Water by following the five-Model process that involves clipping, validating, placing, creating, and merging datasets using FME software and ArcGIS Pro. The resulting 3D GIS system will be optimized for AR applications. It will include adding vertical reference features to emphasize the distance to the surface level from the pipe in AR and to track the Z coordinates' quality via the data model. 

In conclusion, the study presents a change strategy for Brabant Water to create a 3D GIS by integrating Z coordinate datasets into the DWDS. Z coordinates from the AHN4 will be used when the DWDS lacks measured Z coordinates. The data model will track Z coordinates and using vertical reference features that also can be used to show the distance from the pipe to the ground surface in AR."
INFLUENCE OF GUANO DEPOSITION ON PLANT COMMUNITY IN THE DUTCH WADDEN SEA,"['Tuijnman, Camille']","['Reijers, Valérie']",2023-05-02T00:01:25Z,EN,['[Guano] [fertilisation] [nutrient] [waddensea] [geomorphologie]'],Marine Sciences,"The Dutch Wadden Sea islands play an invaluable role in the coastal protection of the mainland from flooding during storm surges. The islands can be divided into two categories, the barrier islands that separate the North Sea from the Wadden Sea, and the islands located behind those islands, the back-barrier islands (Govers & Reijers, 2021). At present, these islands are threatened by human disturbances, predator introduction, and anthropogenic greenhouse emissions causing accelerated sea level rise and increased storm surge frequencies (Trilateral Working Group on Coastal Protection and Sea Level Rise (CPSL), 2001; Veerman & Deltacommissie., 2008; Wang et al., 2012). These threats are reason for concern, as they endanger the survival of the islands and corresponding species. 
The Dutch Wadden Sea islands play a central role in the global flyway networks for migratory shore- and seabirds (Boere & Piersma, 2012; Piersma et al., 2016). They offer feeding, breeding and roosting opportunities. In return, these birds increase ecosystem productivity through the provision of a  marine derived nutrient influx, guano deposition (Anderson & Polis, 1999; Benkwitt et al., 2021; Buelow et al., 2018; Lundberg & Moberg, 2003). Guano is the accumulated excrement of migratory shore- or seabirds and contains high levels of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate phosphorus (Anderson & Polis, 1999; Ellis, 2005; García et al., 2002; Ryan & Watkins, 1989; Wait et al., 2005).
The size and resilience of the islands are dependent on vegetation growth (Durán & Moore, 2013). Yet, their sandy soil is often nutrient poor, constraining the growth of vegetation(V. C. Reijers et al., 2020). This leads to the question if the island’s size and resilience are dependent on guano deposition by migratory shore- and seabirds. 
To answer this question, the effect of guano deposition on island vegetation must be elucidated first. For example, it has been shown that excessive inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen can shift the community composition, resulting in a decrease in species diversity (Avolio et al., 2014; de Schrijver et al., 2011; Payne et al., 2013; Suding et al., 2005). 
However, research on this topic is not always in agreement. On a community level, migratory shore- and seabirds have been shown to decrease the abundance of native species (Hogg & Morton, 1983; Vidal, Médail, Tatoni, Roche, et al., 1998; Vidal, Médail, Tatoni, Vidal, et al., 1998). However, they can also contribute to the persistence of rare native species (Dean et al., 1994; Norton et al., 1997).
Moreover, conflicting results have been published on the effect of migratory shore- and sea birds on species richness. Several studies reported that species richness was higher in areas that were unaffected by birds in comparison to colony areas (Ellis, 2005; Gillham, 1960; Ishida, 1996; Vidal et al., 2003), while other studies reported that the species richness was higher at intermediate levels of bird disturbance (Hogg & Morton, 1983; Vidal et al., 2003). Some reported that the effect of migratory shore- and sea birds on species richness was dependent on the island size (Hogg et al., 1989; Vidal et al., 2000; Vidal, Médail, Tatoni, Roche, et al., 1998) However, these results were also contradicting.
To close this knowledge gap, this thesis aims to investigate the effect of guano deposition on the plant community at the Dutch Wadden islands. It is proposed that the island plant community is dependent on guano deposition. The distance to colony will affect the species diversity, species richness, plant height, root depth and biomass. However, the magnitude of the effects will be dependent on the ecotope that the vegetation originates from. 
The ecotopes reviewed here are sandy barriers and dunes and salt marshes. Sandy barriers and dunes are constantly changing due to wind and water action. In this"

Convolu-tional neural networks are distinguished by their high accuracy and ability to recognize diffi-cult image patterns. In addition to that, cellular automata have been widely used for forest fire spread simulation as it can easily adapted to dynamic environments with spatiotemporal development. This thesis aims to integrate the emerging evolution of artificial intelligence with cellular automata in order to detect forest fire outbreaks and simulate forest fire spreads by using sentinel-2 images. The results of this study show that the inception V3 model, as part of convolutional neural networks, can detect very well fire outbreaks with low data availability and that cellular automata can simulate the spread of the forest fire very accurately."
Microdosing Psychedelics: Harmful or a Positive Trend? – A Systematic Review and Current Status in The Netherlands,"['Zwemmer, Matou']","['Boks, Marco']",2023-05-02T00:01:35Z,EN,[],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Abstract
Over the last years, microdosing psychedelics has become a popular theme in media and scientific research. This systematic review summarizes empirical research on microdosing psychedelics up to date. In total, 42 studies published between 1958 and 2022 are reviewed and categorized into experimental studies, qualitative studies, prospective survey studies, and retrospective survey studies.  Reported effects are classified as positive or negative effects, depending on if the effect has a positive or negative effect on the individual. The results are summarized in the categories mood; well-being and energy; personality; and creativity and cognition. Most experimental studies included a placebo as comparator and only examined the acute effects of a single dose of psychedelics. Experimental studies found positive effects on mood, sociality and cognition, and negative effects on anxiety, physical effects, and consciousness. Self-report studies found positive effects on mood, attention, and well-being, and negative effects on anxiety, physical effects, and cognition. Thus, the effects of microdosing in the experimental and self-report studies are quite similar. However, the effects of microdosing seem to be related to expectations, suggesting that this might be a placebo effect. In addition, the literature shows a lot of inconsistencies in the dose ranges that are used. Mainly self-report studies do not mention the dose ranges, which makes it difficult to compare the results of those studies to each other. On the other hand, experimental studies mainly focus on the acute effects of microdosing, whereas microdosing is often done for a longer period of time. Future studies should therefore focus on the long-term effects of microdosing psychedelics, and always take the dose of the psychedelics into account."

A user-oriented workflow was built so that the assessment of data is not generic anymore as oftentimes in the literature. Instead, a fitness-of-use framework was employed for a more precise assessment. This framework was applied in two use cases, the Counties of Wajir and Nairobi in Kenya. The questions that had to be answered concerned first of all the needs of the health workers and the capacity of the OSM vocabulary in the areas of the use cases to satisfy them. Secondly, the research tried to discover if semantic web technologies can enhance that capacity by unifying a fragmented vocabulary and even help build an ontology to promote it. Then the possibility of a proxy for the quality of OSM data through their correlation with humanitarian mapping projects was investigated. Finally, the basic setup of a web application that supports health workers and individuals in the Global South using OSM data was sought after. The use cases chosen were quite different in socioeconomic characteristics. For Nairobi County, it was discovered that the OSM vocabulary has the capacity to reflect the needs of health workers while Wajir is far poorer. The use of triplified OSM data and the SPARQL queries allowed sophisticated searches for objects and attributes that then were easily translated into ontologies. Through those ontologies, it became possible to query for information that was not tagged in OSM. Moreover, it was shown that the existence of completed humanitarian mapping projects in an area has a positive linear correlation with the completeness of health facility objects and some of their attributes. In conclusion, the present research provided a basic setup of a web application that supports health services with the use of OSM data."
Can deep learning based super-resolution enhance the upsampling of diffusion MRI for brain fiber tractography?,"['Bishas, Pranto']","['Luca, Alberto de']",2023-05-02T00:01:33Z,EN,"['Super-resolution, diffusion MRI, deep learning, convolutional neural network, diffusion tensor imaging, residual\nlearning, fiber tractography']",Medical Imaging,"Diffusion MRI fiber tractography is a non-invasive technique used to investigate the orientation of white matter fibers in the brain. However, obtaining high-resolution diffusion MRI data is challenging and time-consuming. Super-resolution techniques have emerged as a promising method for improving image resolution by enhancing low-resolution images to high-resolution images after acquiring diffusion MRI data. In this project, we investigated the combination of conventional upsampling techniques with the proposed deep super resolution (DSR) framework to evaluate its impact on subsequent fiber tractography.

We downsampled diffusion MRI data by k-space truncation, then re-upsampled to the original resolution using three different techniques: nearest neighbors, cubic b-spline, and zero padding. The results of the upsampling were then given as input to the DSR network. We considered different types of DSR inputs, including 2D patches, 2D whole slices, and 3D volumes.

The combination of zero-padding and the DSR with a 2D patch approach produced the most optimal overall results compared to zero-padding alone. This approach has been further investigated for fiber tractography to assess the reconstruction of white matter tracts. The results showed minimal visible differences between fiber tractography with the original data, after downsampling, and after DSR implementation.

Overall, these results suggest that the tested DSR networks are promising to improve the spatial detail of diffusion MRI data. However, they are still insufficient to improve the quality of fiber tractography. More work is needed to optimize the technique's performance to obtain optimal reconstruction of brain fiber tractography."

way to study the behavior and function of different organs and tissues. Organoids are created by 
growing cells in a 3D environment that mimics the structure and microenvironment of a specific 
organ. This allows researchers to observe and experiment with the cells in a way that more closely 
resembles what happens in the human body. One of the key components of the organoid culture 
is the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is the environment that surrounds the cells and influences 
their physical characteristics such as shape, protein expression, polarization, and orientation of 
the cell. In many cases, the ECM used in the lab is derived from animal sources, such as Matrigel, 
which is used for liver organoids, and Basement Membrane Extract, which is used for kidney 
tubuloids. However, there are drawbacks for using animal-derived ECMs, including potential 
ethical concerns and the difficulty in obtaining a consistent, high-quality ECM. As a result, there 
is a growing interest in finding alternative, animal-free ECMs that can be used to culture organoids. 
This study aimed to evaluate the suitability of three animal-free alternatives, VitroGel, MaxGel, 
and BioGel for liver organoids, and VitroGel and MaxGel for kidney organoids, as potential 
replacements for animal-derived extracellular matrix. These materials have the potential to 
provide researchers with a more consistent and ethical way to study organoids and could lead to

To gather insights into their experiences, semi-structured interviews were carried out in this study, following an exploratory qualitative single-case design. Results reveal that for middle leaders, the most difficult conflicts to manage are inadequate personal interactions and interpersonal differences, and most are solved with integrative strategies. In addition, a differentiation of integrative approaches is proposed by the researcher, namely proactive and reactive, which serve distinct purposes when managing conflicts. The findings point to a need to increase proactive strategies to generate collaboration in team meetings whilst keeping reactive strategies in mind to manage conflict when it arises."

teach all students, as shown by the lower academic achievement of students with a culturally

qualitative study examined the perspectives of 14 Dutch teachers with culturally non-dominant backgrounds on effective teaching in culturally diverse classrooms. Drawing upon a 
social-constructivist research paradigm, the researcher conducted semi-structured interviews 
to examine how CND teachers define effective teaching. Interviews were analysed in an 
interpretivist way through iterative coding and the use of case descriptions. One central theme 
emerged: effective teaching is about making students feel seen. Teachers achieved this by 
using culturally responsive teaching practices (i.e., incorporate students’ cultures and 
experiences in teaching), which they considered normal practice. As the average white Dutch 
teacher does not share this opinion, this study underscores the importance of integrating
culturally responsive teaching in teacher education."

Plausibly, students respond differently to (negative) performance feedback because they react to stress differently. The Biopsychosocial Model (BPSM) of challenge and threat offered a potential explanation for the individual differences in stress responses to feedback. This study investigated whether the BPSM can be used to gain insight into the affective responses (selfreported challenge and threat) to positive and negative valanced feedback, and if individuals' self-efficacy can explain individual differences in these responses. This was researched through an online experiment where Dutch University students answered problem-solving tasks on which they received manipulated performance feedback. Results showed that participants who received negative feedback perceived more threat states and fewer challenge states towards the problem-solving tasks than those who received positive feedback.
Furthermore, results showed that self-efficacy towards problem-solving tasks positively relates to challenge states, and mixed results were found regarding threat states. No moderating effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between feedback valence and affective responses was found. These results encourage further research to investigate how negative performance feedback could be less threatening to students. In addition, it is relevant to reexamine the moderating effect of self-efficacy, given the study's limitations."

Furthermore, to get a better understanding of the employment distribution in the BMA, the project has joined the employment data with socioeconomic data from census tracts. Global Moran’s I and LISA analyses have been performed to comprehend the employment distribution with its most significant working clusters. While this research has been the initial step to accurately understand the employment distribution in the BMA, several tools have been provided that help to perform similar analysis and get significant and comparable results for more precise sectoral employment classifications.

Types of learning mechanisms include identification, coordination, reflection and transformation. These mechanisms represent the learning potential when crossing disciplinary boundaries. Although previous studies show that teachers who collaborate in interdisciplinary education face challenges, they pay little attention to the teachers’ learning opportunities. To that end, twelve interviews with teachers at Utrecht University (UU) were conducted for this study. A qualitative design with a narrative approach using semi-structured interviews was used to identify the four learning mechanisms. First, the results demonstrate that identification occurs in assessing students, differences in teaching and hierarchy. Second, coordination takes place in social interaction, common themes and the organisation of interdisciplinary education. Third, reflection results in creating a new perspective and gaining insight into one’s own identity. Finally, transformation occurs by creating new educational practices and changes in interdisciplinary courses. The results emphasise the importance of maintaining a dialogue with teachers who contribute to interdisciplinary education because it provides insight into how they move across disciplinary boundaries.

By employing the Business Model Design Space (BMDS) and Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) frameworks, this study examines the drivers, barriers, opportunities, Business Model Innovation (BMI), technical specifications, digitalization, and policy measures associated with SEVs and DES in a socio-technical transition.
The findings emphasize the need for a paradigm shift in the European automotive industry, promoting alternative socio-technical energy and personal mobility systems that align with principles of democracy and sustainability. By offering innovative sustainable products and services, SEVs with DES can redefine customers' emotional relationships with conventional automobile paradigms and energy use, thereby inspiring collective reimagination of existing systems. By integrating SEVs with DES and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms, this BMI offers revolutionary customer experiences while reducing GHG emissions and minimizing environmental impact. The value capture opportunities arise from new revenue streams through MaaS and energy communities, fostering job creation along value networks.
The challenges lie in the technological and regulatory dimensions, highlighting the need for a technological benchmark for SEVs and harmonized regulations across European member states. Additionally, policy measures should facilitate the development of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) capabilities, virtual power plants, and peer-to-peer trading. Open innovation, data privacy and security, interoperability, and efficient IT infrastructures are crucial for the successful development of SEV systems.
Cross-sectoral collaboration between SEV niche-industry coalitions, governments, and industry incumbents is essential to overcome resource limitations and provide a platform for innovation in the SEV industry. The findings emphasize the importance of supporting niche-innovators and developing European standards and policies to enable SEVs with DES in Europe's sustainable energy and mobility transition.
While the study focuses on Western European energy systems, the BMDS and MLP methodology can be applied to comparative system analyses globally. Limitations include the need for further exploration of socially innovative methodologies to mitigate rebound effects associated with market-based solutions.
In conclusion, SEVs with DES have the potential to revolutionize the European energy transition by offering sustainable personal mobility and clean energy solutions. To realize this potential, greater investment in research and development, cross-sectoral collaboration, and the development of European standards for SEVs are necessary. By catalyzing the sustainability efforts of energy and mobility systems and inspiring users towards more sustainable norms and behaviors, SEVs with DES can contribute to the achievement of targets outlined in the European Climate Law."
The barriers and opportunities of car-sharing: An analysis of sustainability transitions in regimes and practices in the Dutch automobility system,"['Vries, Sophie de']","['Verkade, Nick']",2023-07-25T00:00:54Z,EN,"['Multi-level perspective, social practice theory, car-sharing']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"This research applies and tests the conceptual framework by Hargreaves et al. (2013) to a new empirical context to enhance our understanding of the sustainability transition from car ownership to car-sharing in the Dutch automobility system. This system undergoes significant pressure due to its impact on congestion, environmental pollution, and climate change. Car-sharing can potentially create a more sustainable automobility system, but its diffusion into the established automobility regime is relatively low. This research aims to understand the barriers and challenges of a potential transition and to develop strategies to overcome them. Current literature predominantly used a vertical, hierarchical, and macro approach (using the multi-level perspective MLP) or a horizontal micro approach (using social practice theory SPT) to analyse this potential transition. These two theoretical perspectives are often seen as competing frameworks in the literature. This research aims to prove the added theoretical and practical value of combining these two theoretical lenses to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the transition towards car-sharing. Therefore, this study is guided by the research questions: What are the intersections between the transitions in the automobility regimes and practices from car ownership to car-sharing, and how can these intersections be transformed into points of opportunity to facilitate a more sustainable Dutch automobility system? This research presents new empirical findings from a qualitative case study of the Dutch automobility system and peer-to-peer and business-to-consumer car-sharing services. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with various stakeholders, including car-sharing providers, provinces, municipalities, mobility consultants, car owners, and car-sharing users guided by the MLP and SPT frameworks. The twin analysis revealed six critical intersection points where regimes and practices constrain each other and inhibit the transition to a more sustainable automobility system. The SPT-based analysis added value to the regime transition by identifying constraints faced by the car-sharing niche due to embedded automobility practices, including ownership practices, stacking practices in time and space, and challenges in switching practices. The MLP-based analysis added value to the practice transition by emphasizing the role of wider regimes in disrupting embedded automobility practices, including urban planning, transport, and economic regimes. These intersection points demonstrated that only adopting one theoretical lens might overlook certain innovation dynamics. Moreover, this research provides intervention strategies that can help policymakers leverage the opportunities presented by these intersections to remove regulatory barriers, develop supportive measures, and implement incentives to facilitate car-sharing growth and foster a more sustainable Dutch automobility system."
Using machine learning for non-prompt D0 analysis,"['Bolle, Colin']","['Grelli, A.G.']",2023-07-22T00:02:33Z,EN,['Particle physics; non-prompt; D0; ALICE'],Experimental Physics,"In the last decade the pT differential cross-sections of heavy mesons such as D0 mesons
have been measured extensively at the LHC for a variety of rapidity and energy ranges
in proton-proton (pp) collisions. These measurements provide tests for standard model
theories such as quantum chromo dynamics (QCD) and a baseline for measurements
in heavy-ion collisions in which a plasma-like state of matter consisting of deconfined
quarks and gluons (QGP) forms. Since the bottom (b) quark is the heaviest quark apart
from the top quark it is produced very early in the hard scattering process making it the
excellent probe. The properties of the b quark can be indirectly accessed by studying
non-prompt D0 mesons. However a large fraction of promptly hadronized D0 mesons
is present after the hadronization processes. These prompt D0 mesons are identical to
non-prompt D0 mesons making it extremely challenging to separate the two. In this
thesis we study the possibility to maximise the non-prompt over prompt D0
ratio using two types of machine learning algorithms. We discuss the training results of boost
decision trees using adaptive boosting and convolutional neural networks and compare
the performance of both algorithms to choose the model which suits the scope of this
thesis. We report an increase of the non-prompt fraction between 2.268 ± 0.08 and
69.76 ± 20.1 when the boost decision tree is used replace the standard selection cuts
made in the invariant mass reconstruction. The invariant mass is reconstructed in the
interval 5 < pT < 24 GeV/c with a fraction of about 18% of the data sample available
with significances between 2.4 ± 0.8 and 6.3 ± 1.1. Using these significances we show
that within the boundaries of the available minimum bias data it is possible to obtain
significances greater than 5.0 for 5 < pT < 24 GeV/c. Future studies can be performed
to improve the algorithms and other classification algorithms, such as transformers, can
be used to increase the non-prompt D0
fraction."

Towards Urban Green Justice,"['Pinto, Rosaline']","['Driessen, Peter']",2023-07-25T00:00:57Z,EN,['Environmental Justice; Urban Green Jusitce; Governance Capacity; Urban Green'],Sustainable Development,"This research focuses on the governance capacity of Rotterdam and Utrecht in addressing urban green (in)justice. With the vulnerability of urban areas to climate change impacts and the increasing need for cities to take action, urban greening is being utilized as a strategy to adapt to climate change. However, recent studies indicate that the benefits of urban greening are unevenly distributed, leading to environmental (in)justice issues. This research employs an embedded multiple case study methodology with the aim to enhance understanding of how urban green (in)justice is assessed and analyze the governance capacity in relation to urban green (in)justice.
Both Rotterdam and Utrecht demonstrate a level of commitment to addressing urban green (in)justice. They acknowledge existing disparities in the quantity and quality of urban green, particularly in older neighborhoods and the city center. Utrecht exhibits a stronger commitment by explicitly recognizing inequality and consistently acknowledging disparities in urban green. Rotterdam, on the other hand, has a broader focus on overall city attractiveness and livability, with no explicit mention of inequality or distributional green injustice in its documents and vision. Furthermore, the findings show that there is a need for more tailored and inclusive approaches to engage residents in decision-making processes. Currently, stakeholders feel that their input is disregarded by authorities, indicating a gap between aspirations for procedural green justice and practical implementation. Additionally, while both cities do not explicitly address recognitional green (in)justice in their policy documents, both do recognize the diversity of the city. However, there is still room for improvement in representing the diversity of neighborhoods in participation processes.
The governance capacity of both cities contributes to addressing environmental (in)justice in urban green initiatives, with Utrecht scoring slightly higher. However, all dimensions of governance capacity (knowing, wanting, and enabling) are equally important for effective change. The increasing awareness of urban green (in)justice as a priority is observed in both cities, particularly in Utrecht.
In conclusion, this research highlights the importance of governance capacity in addressing environmental (in)justice in urban green initiatives. With the expectation of continued climate change and more extreme weather conditions, urban green (in)justice will become increasingly relevant worldwide. The findings provide valuable insights for Rotterdam, Utrecht, and other cities, facilitating the development of more inclusive and equitable approaches to urban greening in the face of climate change challenges."
Wat Betekent Groepsgrootte voor het Leefklimaat en de Veiligheidsbeleving in de Residentiële Jeugdhulpverlening.,"['Wit, Naomi de']","['Buskens, Vincent']",2023-07-24T12:28:28Z,NL,[],Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems,"Inleiding: De residentiële jeugdhulp maakt momenteel een ombouw door van gesloten- en/of grote leefgroepen naar open kleinschalige leefgroepen.

Theorie: De zelfdeterminatie theorie, ervaringen en verwachtingen uit de praktijk, werden gebruikt om ervaringen van groepsgrootte en woonsetting tot het leefklimaat en de veiligheidsbeleving te begrijpen. Methode: Secundaire kwantitatieve gegevens van één van de grootste residentiële jeugdhulporganisaties in Nederland zijn gebruikt. Respondenten wonen verspreid over 52 leefgroepen. Complex samples multipele lineaire regressies en een complex samples logistische regressie werden gebruikt om inzicht te krijgen in de impact van groepsgrootte, woonsetting en de interactie daarvan op het leefklimaat en de veiligheidsbeleving. Gemeten vanuit het perspectief van de jeugdigen zelf. Resultaten: Er is enkel een positieve tendens voor grotere gesloten leefgroepen op de dimensies leefklimaat en veiligheidsbeleving gevonden als de vergelijking wordt gemaakt met het gemiddelde. Groepsgrootte in een open woonsetting, is een negatieve voorspeller voor het leefklimaat als issues van leefklimaat gaan over onderlinge omgang. Conclusie en implicaties: Over het algemeen laten de onderzoeksresultaten zien dat er geen hoofdeffect is van groepsgrootte en woonsetting op het leefklimaat en de veiligheidsbeleving. Als we inzoomen op het leefklimaat in open residentiële leefgroepen, lijkt het negatieve effect van groepsgrootte zich vooral voor te doen buiten de interactie van de jeugdigen en pedagogisch medewerker om. Daarom bestaat het advies om groepsgrootte niet enkel te zien als doorslaggevende factor van behandeluitkomsten maar om groepsgrootte te zien in relatie tot context factoren."
The equivocal role of proximity dimensions on technological novelty,"['Lekkerkerker, Maurice']","['Janssen, Matthijs']",2023-07-25T00:00:46Z,EN,['technological novelty nlp word embeddings proximity dimensions energy r&d'],Innovation Sciences,"Technological development is driven by the recombination of related technological components and is occasionally disrupted through the introduction of uncommon combinations. These novel combinations can result in radically different technologies with profound economic and societal impact. However, the mechanisms through which technological novelty is created are not well understood. This complicates policy making in its aim to influence technological novelty. To address this research gap, this study measures the influence of proximities between R&D project partners on two types of technological novelty: (1) structural novelty, which involves the combination of disparate technological components and (2) functional novelty, which involves the introduction of technologies new to the system. We develop a text-based approach for quantifying technological novelty by utilizing GloVe word vectors obtained from energy R&D project abstracts. The novelty measures are validated and regressed against proximity characteristics of the R&D projects derived from Boschma’s (2005) proximity framework. We found mixed results. Organizational proximity was found to have a negative effect on structural novelty for some technologies but a positive effect on functional novelty for energy efficiency projects. Technological and geographical proximity were found to be negatively associated with functional novelty for solar and wind energy technologies respectively. The remaining tested relationships were not significant. Despite these mixed results, our study highlights the value of using a text-based approach to measuring technological novelty. This offers a potentially valuable tool for policy makers in their efforts to ex ante detect technological novelty."

Because many programs are inherently memory-bound, it is beneficial to minimise the number of repeated memory loads and the number of temporary, intermediate arrays generated by this process.
In this thesis, we study whether the number of temporary arrays can be reduced when performing a permutation after an expansion. Moreover, we will study the performance benefits of such a reduction."

Therefore it is desirable to create research-based principles for instructional video designs (De Koning et al., 2018). This experiment therefore examined the effect of listening to music on the level of arousal, mood, and learning in children from the fifth and sixth grade of elementary school. All participants studied an instructional video in which they learned about the moon. Before the video, they listened to music that aimed to elicit a certain mood (positive or negative) and arousal (high or low). The manipulation of arousal was successful, post-music arousal scores significantly differed from pre-music arousal scores. However, this difference did not lead to different retention scores. The mood manipulation was unsuccesfull. Therefore, exploratory analyses were conducted; the effect of mood and arousal on retention was examined independently of the music conditions. Repeated measures ANOVAs found an effect of arousal and mood on retention. A repeated measures ANCOVA with mood as between subject factor and retention as within subject factor, with arousal as covariate, was nonsignificant. The effect of mood on retention only occurred when combined with higher arousal levels."

belonging: student-teacher interaction, curriculum, and the ethnic composition of schools. 
Fourteen participants shared their experiences during semi-structured interviews. 
Subsequently, thematic data analysis was conducted to identify recurring patterns. Findings
revealed that students experienced instances where teachers cast them as representatives of 
non-Western countries, making them feel pressured. The participants expressed 
disappointment with the curriculum, which overlooked essential aspects of non-Western 
history and cultures. This insight contributed to students’ insecurity about their cultural 
identity and fostered ignorance among their white peers. Students from predominantly white 
schools experienced difficulty expressing their cultural identity and developing connections 
with white peers. Conversely, students from culturally diverse schools could express their 
cultural identity more easily, with peers and teachers serving as influential role models.
Findings indicate the urgency for schools to create an inclusive and culturally supportive 
environment to foster a sense of belonging for ethnic minority students."
The effectiveness of virtual reality-assisted hypnosis against itch: the creation and evaluation of a new therapeutic concept,"['Mattens, Jard']","['Werkhoven, Peter']",2023-07-27T00:02:46Z,EN,"['(chronic) itch, virtual reality (VR), hypnosis, top-down inhibition, psychodermatology, therapeutic design, focus group, (heuristic) evaluation']",Human-Computer Interaction,"Chronic itch is a disabling condition with currently limited treatment options. Virtual reality (VR) is an approach that takes people to another place and has demonstrated to temporarily reduce itch. Hypnosis, which is a state of relaxation, has been applied with more long-term relief of itch in the specific case of severe eczema. However, hypnosis tends to depend on an individual’s susceptibility, or ease to come into hypnosis. A combination of VR and hypnosis (VRH) has been proposed, since it may combine the longer-lasting effects of hypnosis with VR, making the hypnosis more accessible by facilitating imagination. Even though VRH is promising, it has never been investigated in itch. This study focusses on the patient-guided development and evaluation of a novel VRH-based treatment scheme - including the design and programming of a VR-environment, and the creation of the accompanying hypnosis scripts - directed at chronic itch. On top of that, we here propose an interventional study to assess the effectiveness of the VRH and VR in reducing itch and its psychological burden in individuals with chronic itch. In this randomized controlled trial, a VRH and a VR treatment will be studied for their potential to reduce clinical itch from baseline till after 8 sessions and at follow-up (6 weeks after the end of treatment). Secondarily, the VRH and the VR treatment groups are compared. The medical treatment need, itch sensitivity and overall wellbeing of the participants are also assessed. Patient inclusion is expected around late summer/autumn 2023. If effective, this technique may be further optimized to provide an on-demand treatment option to alleviate itch (independent of its origin) and its associated burden of disease."

The current cross-sectional study examined contact with (step-)parents and emotional distress as contributing factors to the strikingly large differences in 
sexual intercourse between Dutch teenagers with divorced parents and those with married parents. Regression analyses were performed using data from 6978 high school students from the 2017 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study. Results showed no effect. However, both a problematic relationship with parents and increased levels of emotional distress were confirmed to be associated with a higher frequency of sexual activity. These effects were particularly strong among girls aged 14 and 15. Interestingly, the (often problematic) relationship with stepparents was not significantly correlated with sexual activity.This study showed that contact with biological parents and emotional distress, especially at ages 14 and 15, should be considered important factors in teen sexual interventions.

In reflection of this diverse range of nanochannel applications, we research nanofluidic systems in the context of two different topics, that of brain-inspired iontronic circuitry and that of capturing CO2.
		
Electrolyte-filled conical channels are memristors, a device with a history-dependent electrical resistance, i.e. a resistor with “a memory”. Memristors are the fundamental building blocks of brain-inspired computer circuits, which promise excellent energy efficiency compared to conventional computers. With a theoretical model originating from the Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes equations we can attribute the memristive effects of conical channels to dynamic salt accumulation or depletion in the channel due to a time-dependent electric potential drop over the channel. This model predicts time-dependent currents which match well with finite element simulations. Using this theoretical model, we design iontronic circuits containing these conical channels, which exhibit neuromorphic behaviour such as all-or-none action potentials and spike trains. Moreover, by leveraging the mathematical framework behind memristors, we can make general statements about a wide class of volatile memristors, which we validate against simulations of nanochannel memristors.
		
The study of nanochannels is also applicable in the investigation of the CO2 capture method Supercapacitive Swing Adsorption (SSA). This is a relatively new and poorly understood method of capturing CO2, which relies on cheap non-toxic materials and promises excellent energy efficiency. SSA relies on charging and discharging porous electrodes, soaked in an electrolyte. By numerically solving the General Modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations we show that the local increase or decrease in CO2 derived ions in the electrodes can account for observations made in experimental work."

The participants were 38 university students. The instruments included achievement emotions questionnaire, intrinsic motivation inventory, and knowledge test. Multiple linear regression analyses and non-parametric tests were performed for the data analyses. The results showed that immersion increases intrinsic motivation and positive emotions and decreases negative emotions. There was no statistically significant effect on test performance. We conclude that high immersive learning environments positively impact student motivation and emotions, but do not significantly affect test performance. Integrating virtual reality in education enhances students’ intrinsic motivation and positive emotions but considering cognitive load and instructional design principles is crucial for optimal learning outcomes. Virtual reality technology can be used as a supplementary tool to boost student motivation and emotional well-being."

there are still significant gaps that prevent gender equality from being achieved. Recent feminist 
literature has critiqued symptomatic approaches to gender and called for the use of Gender 
Transformative Approaches (GTAs) in this field, to tackle the underlying, root causes of gender 
equality, namely, social norms, and hegemonic power structures. However, there is a lack of 
research on what elements of GTAs promote what changes, for whom, and how GTAs intersect with
the changing environmental and socio-economic contexts of smallholder’s broader livelihoods. This 
study looks specifically at the Gender Action Learning System (GALS) approach, being used in the 
Circular Coffee Project in San Martín, and takes an intersectional, power focused- approach (power 
over, power to, power within and power with), to investigate in what ways such an approach 
contributes to gender transformative change, within coffee smallholder’s livelihoods. 

Qualitative field research was conducted in 5 smallholder coffee producing communities in San 
Martín, Peru through 5 evaluation workshops, 21 interviews with producers and 5 key informants, 
visual elicitation, and participant observation. These methods were undertaken to understand the 
impact of the GTA approach on gender transformative change within coffee producer livelihoods. 
Policy analysis of project documents was undertaken to understand the framings, purpose and 
assumption behind the specific approach chosen, to understand its influence on outcomes. 

The results highlight that at the household level, GALS promotes recognition of women’s work, more 
equal divisions of labour, decision-making, sharing of resources, co-planning for the future and selfconfidence of women. However institutional barriers both at the cooperative and project level 
prevent women’s “power to”, which in turn put limitations on other power dimensions, and prevent 
progress towards gender transformative change, highlighting the importance of institutional barriers
as key levers of change. Further, the structural environmental and economic insecurity of coffee 
producers’ broader livelihoods, and their intersections with gendered power structures, presents a 
real risk to a reversal in gender transformative progress, revealing the need for more systemic 
approaches to GTC in the future. 

The research concludes that to ensure effective gender transformative change that works for 
producers’ broader livelihoods, GTA’s should pay closer attention to intersectionality, institutional 
context, organisational bias, and the intersections of gender transformative change with broader 
livelihood resilience. Therefore, transformative approaches, particularly when implemented in a 
global supply chain context, should take a critical, intersectional and systems approach to their 
design, implementation and evaluation"

halted and forest-biodiversity restored. This transition was facilitated through institutions that stimulated
landowners to move from farming to practices that conserved forests. With a neoliberal approach rural 
landowners were aimed to provide forest protection within a proactive forests sector and market that 
provides benefits for conservation. This research analyzes the issues of adaptation landowners had due to 
this approach of landowner-stimulation, and how this approach has impacted rural inhabitants. It does so 
from a bottom up perspective, using the sustainable livelihoods framework. This framework provides a 
perspective on rural inhabitants access to resources, their strategies of living and working, and the 
outcomes of these strategies. The framework is holistic and comprehensive because it looks at these 
dimensions but also incorporates context and transforming processes such as government policy. This 
research thus analyzes how specific policy, the stimulation of landowners to conserve, relates to the 
dimensions of resource, strategies and outcomes for rural inhabitants, while considering the specific 
context of Costa Rica. It focuses particularly on the issues for sustainable rural livelihoods that have arisen, 
in an attempt to provide constructive criticism for improvement of policy and further research. This 
research is a desk research that makes use of case studies and academic literature, but also has an empirical 
angle using interviews with actors who have different perspectives on forest conservation in Costa Rica.
First socioeconomic context and the development history of the country are summarized, as well as forest
conservation policies of recent decades. Then specific policy measures and implementation through several 
institutions are analyzed: This has given an overview of a diverse array of measures that have stimulated 
landowners to participate in conservation. In the central chapter of this research interviews and case studies 
are analyzed for perspectives and data on how these measures have impacted the dimensions of rural 
livelihood resources, strategies and outcomes. In the discussion these findings are reflected upon and
suggestions are given for further research and policy improvement. Results show that adaptation has been 
difficult for many landowners: The rural poor struggle with barriers and regulations and could be better 
included and protected. New strategies like agroforestry, forest plantations and (eco)tourism have changed 
the rural economy and created opportunities, but also impacts and livelihood insecurity. Market-based 
incentives have led to limited success, but also created new inequalities."

Het doel van het onderzoek is om inzicht te verkrijgen in de principes van passende zorg en de uitdagingen die zich voordoen bij de implementatie ervan.

Deze scriptie analyseert diverse relevante rapporten en ontrafelt de betekenis van vier centrale principes van passende zorg: 'waardegedreven', 'samen met en rondom de patiënt', 'de juiste zorg op de juiste plek', en 'gezondheid in plaats van ziekte'. Het onderzoek identificeert spanningsvelden binnen passende zorg, waaronder bijvoorbeeld de belangentegenstellingen tussen kostenbesparing en kwaliteitsverbetering.

Op basis van de resultaten van de analyse wordt passende zorg toegepast op het zorgdomein van zorg rondom het levenseinde. Hierbij worden belangrijke aspecten geïdentificeerd, waaronder de lessen die kunnen worden getrokken uit de expertise van palliatieve zorg, de uitdagingen van kostenbesparing bij zorg rondom het levenseinde, de impact van passende zorg op medicalisering van ouderdom en sterven, de verwachtingen ten aanzien van gespreksvoering door zorgverleners, en de specifieke kenmerken van de gemiddelde oudere in Nederland die interacteren met de implementatie van passende zorg.

Throughout this thesis, I critically engage with Donna Haraway’s (2003) companion species concept and expand it to the rooted-resistance-companionship to comprehensively understand the relationality between Palestinians and olive trees in their context of sumud practices under the Zionist settler colonial regime. The concept of rooted-resistance-companionship emphasizes the interconnection through which Palestinians and olive trees engage in an anticolonial praxis. Through this concept, I posit a posthuman feminist (Braidotti 2022) glance and present a cultural analysis by embarking on a journey tracing the trajectory of olive trees, from their initial existence in the soil to their subsequent re-presentation in literary and visual artworks. I focus on Mahmoud Darwish’s poem Earth Pressing against Us (2003), prose Absent Presence (2010), and photographer Steve Sabella’s Till the End (2004) visual artwork. My primary interest lies in examining Israel’s Zionist terraforming strategies and how the olive tree’s journey epitomizes rooted-resistance-companionship and elucidates how olive trees and Palestinians mutually share a colonial wound stemming from the ongoing Nakba."

This factor, or one of the most important at least, is the difference in the levels of integration in 2014 and 2022 and the spillovers that drive the integration process. In this period of time, a significant integration process has gone underway which caused different outcomes as the EU institutions, some of the governments and indeed a common European society decided to stand up for the core principles. Furthermore, the spillovers, outlined by the neofunctionalist framework, can potentially influence the policy directly. The impact of the integration process, and the spillovers in particular has not been properly addressed by the current literature on the Ukraine conflict and the EU’s response to it. This research aims to fill this gap in the theory and gain a better understanding of the underlying dynamics."
The road to effective animal welfare policy,"['Vermeulen, Christel']","['Bos, Lute']",2023-08-01T00:01:04Z,EN,['Animal welfare; policymaking; social constructivism; municipality; public administration'],Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems,"This is a study on the construction of animal welfare policy within Dutch municipalities. The research is inspired by Utrecht University, and the desire of the municipality of Veenendaal to discover what is going on surrounding animal welfare in the municipality. The municipality of Veenendaal wished to give substance to the statement in the council agreement: ‘Attention to animal welfare’, but was unsure what steps to follow. This research generally follows a dual structure by looking at developments in society that contribute to animal welfare concerns and looking at how these concerns can be translated into policy. As animal welfare is described as the ‘neglected child of policymaking’ by over half of the interviewed respondents, the desire to concretize policy is prevalent. From this research, it can be seen that collective action is socially constructed. Political activism and proximity are found to be related to the degree of concern in Dutch societies. Even though there is a growing concern in society, this does not directly lead to effective policies due to the wickedness of policymaking. This is why stakeholders regarding animal welfare policy are strongly advised to document transparent and defined agreements with executing and consulting parties."
Maritime spatial planning and regional EU lobbying,"['Boer, Marcel']","['Geeraert, Arnout']",2023-08-01T00:01:13Z,EN,"['Lobbying, EU, Regional, Factors, Success, Dutch']",European Governance,"Regions in the EU are becoming increasingly responsible for implementing EU legislation. This has incentivised regions to increase their efforts of influencing EU legislation. It is currently poorly understood why regions are sometimes successful in influencing policy change in the EU. In this thesis, I analyse three factors that could influence regional lobbying success. I do this by looking at the lobbying coalitions made during the maritime spatial planning (MSP) directive policy process. This thesis shows that the timing of lobbying, the internal cohesion of a coalition and the amount of members in a coalition all affect lobbying success of coalitions with regions in them. The most important finding however, is that regions do not seem to have direct influence in shaping EU policy. In EU policy creation processes, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament are the three responsible bodies. Regional lobbying during the MSP policy creation process seems to have partially shaped the opinions in the Council but not the opinions of the Commission and European Parliament. The Dutch and German regions managed to partially shape the opinion of their national government. These national governments then in turn shaped the opinions in the Council. Thus, showing that regions had indirect influence but not direct influence in shaping the MSP directive."

One way to acquire these competencies is through study experience abroad. However, that is not feasible for the majority of students (Jones, 2013). In order to offer possibilities for all students to develop GII competencies, universities engage in internationalization at home (IaH) activities (Beelen & Leask, 2005). This research aimed to discover Dutch students’ experiences with IaH activities. The most valuable IaH activities in the eyes of the Dutch students were: comparing perspectives, having international guest lectures, mixing Dutch and international students in both mandatory and voluntary activities, and developing English language skills. Students who have no intention of working for an international company should be offered low-threshold activities instead of direct involvement with international students. The freedom of choice of every student should be respected based on their personality. More opportunities should be created where international and national students can get in contact in a meaningful manner for both parties."
Disability meets dog. The enactment of visual disability at the first guide dog schools (1916-1939),"['Barkema, Merlijn']","['Ruberg, W.G.']",2023-08-05T00:01:17Z,EN,['guide dogs; praxiography; disability history; animal history'],History,"Guide dogs have been part of human history for a long time, but only were trained systematically 
from 1916 onwards as a result of the many German soldiers that were blinded during the First 
World War. The years after the war were a key period for the development of mobility aids, 
including guide dogs and the white mobility cane. In guide dog training, issues of dependency, 
agency and materiality come together that play a role in both disability and animal history, making 
it productive to combine both fields. This thesis uses praxiography to answer the question how 
visual disability was enacted in the specific practices of guide dog training from 1916 until 1939 in 
the guide dog schools of the Deutscher Verein für Sanitätshunde, the Verein für deutsche 
Schäferhunde, L’Oeil qui Voit, the Nederlands Geleidehonden Fonds and the Institut für 
Umweltforschung. The historical context is taken into account, but the focus of my research are 
the interactions that took place ‘on the ground’ between the trainer, visually impaired person and 
dog. By studying practices, I want to avoid the essentialism of the medical model of disability, but 
also include the materiality that is often lost in social constructivist approaches. The attribution of 
agency over the three main actors I study, and therefore how visual disability was enacted, shifted 
over the course of the interbellum. From a passive presence, the visually impaired person became 
an active participant of guide dog training. Visual disability continued to be a problem, but it 
became an obstacle to overcome instead of a fact of life to work around."
Separable verbs in Aruban multilingual code-switching: Ta style di mi kier a daag mi mes uit.,"['Geerman, Elisha']","[""D'Alessandro, Roberta""]",2023-08-05T00:01:19Z,EN,['the ABC islands; code-switching; corpus study; Dutch; English; Generativist principles; I-language; little v; Matrix Language Framework; multilingualism; Papiamento; Papiamentu; periphrastic verb phrase; Spanish; separable verbs'],Linguistics,"Germanic languages have a peculiar form of verbs that exhibit the ability to have the verb non-linearly adjacent to its particle, resulting in a Verb-Object-Particle (VOP) word order (Bennis, 1992; Wurmbrand, 2000; Barbiers et al., 2018). These co-called separable verbs are not present in Papiamento/u, yet often times speakers from Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao can be observed code-switching in Papiamento/u with them. The aim of this study is to provide an account of the structure of Papiamento-Dutch and Papiamento-English code-switching with a focus on these separable verbs as employed by Arubans. Taking into account the presence of separable verbs in Dutch and English but the lack thereof in Spanish and Papiamento, we expected to observe a clash between the verb phrases (VP) involved. Following González-Vilbazo & López’s (2011; 2012) argumentation for the structural representation of the bilingual – in this case multilingual – I-language, we expected to see an underlying dependency between T and little v (v), the influence of T on the morphological complexity of V, and that v and V could belong to different languages. Our corpus study consisted of three distinct corpora: the Geerman Corpus, the AFY Corpus, and the MPI CS Corpus. Across the board similar code-switched structures could be observed, namely Papiamento tense markers and a morphologically simplex separable verbs that showed VOP and VPO word orders. It was possible to make the following generalisations based on our results. Firstly, separable verb code-switched structures contain a compulsory Papiamento tense marker and a morphologically simplex separable verb; this tense marker is the overt spell-out of T. Secondly, head-T and head-v are required to belong to the same language in the code-switched derivation: Papiamento ø-marker is available for the root in V (regardless of the language). Lastly, the V and v can belong to two different languages; V may be a donor verb, but it is c-commanded within the structure by the language of v."
The Influence of Passive Social Networking Site Use on Self-Esteem: TheMediating Role of Upward Comparison and FoMO,"['Klundert, Silke van de']","['Maes, Marlies']",2023-08-07T08:11:55Z,EN,['adolescents; passive SNS use; upward comparison; FoMO; self-esteem'],Youth Studies,"Previous research indicates that passive use of social networking sites (SNSs) negatively

Therefore, the current study investigated the relation between passive SNS use and selfesteem among Dutch adolescents, and whether upward comparison and Fear of Missing Out
(FoMO) could explain this relation. Longitudinal data from the Digital Youth Project
collected in 2017/2018 were used. The data were collected using annual online surveys. The
sample included 1372 adolescents between the ages of 11 and 17 (M = 13.61, SD = 1.18).
Against expectations, passive SNS use was not associated with later self-esteem in
adolescents. Upward comparison and FoMO could therefore not explain this relation.
However, the results showed that a higher degree of upward comparison and a higher degree
of FoMO are both associated with lower self-esteem in adolescents. These findings implicate
that the passive type of SNS use might not determine negative SNS effects on adolescents’
self-esteem. Instead, future research should focus on examining individual characteristics that
determine negative or positive effects of SNS use on self-esteem and general well-being of
adolescents."
Reprofiling watercourses to increase groundwater levels and mitigate drought,"['Benschop, Inge']","['Wanders, Niko']",2023-08-07T00:00:53Z,EN,['Drought; Mitigation; Redesigning; Water system; Groundwater; Modelling'],Water Science and Management,"Increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns due to climate change are affecting the fresh water availability and causing drought issues globally. The increased drought severity is affecting the livelihoods of people and causing significant economic damage. The elevated sandy soils of The Netherlands are especially affected by the increased drought issues due to the soil composition, elevation, climate and little fresh water inflow. The increased pressure on the fresh water availability due to the changing climate results in declining groundwater levels affecting nature and agricultural areas. The current body of literature on modelling drought mitigation measures is however limited. Therefore this thesis is focused on analysing the effect of drought mitigation measures, in specific reprofiling watercourses, on groundwater levels.

The effect of reprofiling watercourses in the elevated sandy soils of The Netherlands was analysed by applying the groundwater model Amigo on the study area Winterswijk. The effect of reprofiling primary or secondary watercourses were analysed as well as the combined effect of reprofiling both watercourses. Additionally, an analysis has been performed on the effect it has on the agricultural and nature areas. The effect of reprofiling watercourses were analysed based on groundwater characteristics in order to quantify the impact.
Raising the river bed and water level of primary watercourses was shown to be most effective in the whole area of Winterswijk but also specifically in the agricultural and nature area. Raising the river bed and water level of both primary and secondary watercourses simultaneously was shown to be overall most effective. The effectiveness of reprofiling either primary or secondary watercourses depend on the water system. A shallow water system dominated with secondary watercourses experiences more effect from reprofiling secondary watercourses. All in all raising the river bed and water level of watercourses while maintaining the same drainage volume resulted in a significant increase of groundwater levels and great contribution to drought mitigation.

While groundwater models are mere a simplification of reality, the results were supported by literature and provided valuable insights for future water management strategies. Nevertheless, reprofiling measures can mitigate drought but also increase nuisance. Therefore, further research is required on different reprofiling measures to find a balance between drought mitigation and preventing nuisance."
Ship Heave Motion Prediction Using LSTM Neural Networks Without Wave Excitation Information,"['Keijzer, Jolan']","['Panja, Deb']",2023-08-08T00:00:43Z,EN,[],Applied Data Science,"In off-shore multi-body operations, it is important to accurately determine the movements of the vessels
to allow for safe operations. This is especially evident in multi-body operations that involve helicopters,
due to the relative motion between the landing deck and the helicopter. To be able to augment human
judgement in helicopter/off-shore vessel multi-body operations, it is crucial to have accurate predictions
of the movements of the vessel. One of the key movements of off-shore vessels in these operations is the
heave motion, which represents the up and down movements of the vessel. Modelling these movements
mathematically is a difficult feat due to the strong non-linearity of these movements, and the complicated
hydrodynamic forces and stochastic sea disturbances that are at the root of these movements. Therefore,
Neural Networks bear a lot of opportunity in this regard, because of their strong ability of handling
non-linearity. Especially, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are useful in this regard owing
to their strong ability of handling sequences and their ability of learning both long- and short-term
dependencies. However, most existing research uses wave excitation information to predict the heave
motion even though ships are not often equipped with expensive wave detection systems. Therefore,
this paper researches whether LSTM models are able to accurately predict heave motions 10 and 20
seconds ahead without the usage of wave excitation information. This paper shows that LSTM models
are able to achieve accurate predictions without the usage of wave excitation information. Therefore,
it is shown that LSTM models have the ability to augment human judgement in helicopter/off-shore
vessel operations where this wave excitation information is not available. Especially in terms of 10
second ahead predictions LSTM is able to achieve promising prediction performance. However, the
prediction quality of the 20 second ahead predictions is less satisfying. Finally, most existing papers
used simple one-layer LSTM models, whereas this paper shows that using more complicated models
lead to increased prediction performance.

TE. Both results showed a moderate effect size, suggesting that team members who prioritize
team goals over their own goals tend to provide more feedback to their team, and that SMMs
positively relate to TE. However, this study has some limitations, including a small sample
size and the self-report design. Future research could evaluate alternative measures for TE

Price-Control and Availability of Antibiotics: a Balancing Act,"['Marinus, Steven']","['Bell, Leendert de']",2023-08-10T00:03:33Z,EN,['antibiotica; antibioticum; preferentiebeleid; GVS; Wgp; beschikbaarheid; medicijnen'],Science and Business Management,"To combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the availability of antibiotics (novel and existing ones) is imperative. However, this availability of antibiotics on the Dutch market is declining, and shortages of antibiotics are becoming more frequent. There are concerns that this is negatively impacted by price-controlling instruments present in the Dutch healthcare system. Whether this actually the case, is yet unknown. To assess these potential problems and explore directions for potential future solutions, this research project investigates the effect of the Dutch price-controlling instruments GVS (Medicine Reimbursement System) reimbursement limits, Wgp (Medicines Prices Act) maximum allowable prices and/or preferential policy on the availability of essential outpatient antibiotics on the Dutch market between 2013 and 2022.

Through a quantitative, exploratory and inductive research approach using data from several databases and data sources, results showed a decrease in both the number of essential outpatient antibiotics and the average number of products per essential outpatient PRK (prescriptiecode; prescription code) cluster, but no change in the number of suppliers or summed revenue per product. Furthermore, we found that 78% of essential outpatient antibiotics had an AIP (apotheek inkoopprijs; pharmacy purchasing price) below its GVS reimbursement limit, and that the GVS reimbursement limit has not put significantly more pressure on essential outpatient products that have been removed from the market than it puts on those still on the market. 31% of all essential outpatient antibiotics has a Wgp maximum allowable price equal to its AIP. In 83% of cases, the Wgp maximum allowable price is also lower than the GVS reimbursement limit and thus the limiting factor in price setting of essential outpatient antibiotics. The average number of products per PRK cluster decreased more steeply for clusters that contained antibiotics included in a preferential policy compared to the clusters that did not, but that the average number of products overall was higher in the clusters which included preferential products. Lastly, results showed that only 1/59 (~2%) preferential outpatient antibiotics was preferential with all 4 health insurance companies. 

Taken together, we conclude that 1) the overall market of essential outpatient antibiotics is starting to show signs of impoverishment; 2) the GVS reimbursement limit is not likely to be the (main) reason essential outpatient antibiotics are taken off the market; 3) the Wgp maximum allowable price might be putting undesirable pressure on the price of essential outpatient antibiotics, and is most often the limiting factor in price setting of essential outpatient antibiotics; 4) although the presented data provides indications that the preferential policy might influence essential outpatient antibiotics being removed from the market, many questions remain unanswered as to how and to what extent, and whether this is negatively impacting patients; and 5) the distribution of preferential outpatient antibiotics over the different health insurance policies is unlikely to contribute to availability issues. Future research might focus on the relationship between price-controlling instruments and inpatient antibiotics and could aim to further elucidate the role of the preferential policy on availability issues."
Interplay of Environmental Signals in High Altitude Plants,"['Jansen, Harm']","['Abbas, M.']",2023-08-10T00:03:24Z,EN,['Environmental cues; high altitude; molecular signaling'],Environmental Biology,"Plant growth at high altitudes require adaptation to extreme environmental conditions. High altitude plants experience elevated levels of UV-B irradiation, lower temperatures, and reduced atmospheric pressure, leading to decreased partial pressures of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). In this study, we will focus on the mechanisms through which plants perceive and respond to light, temperature, O2, and CO2 levels. Additionally, we will explore the unique adaptations of high altitude plants to endure the challenging conditions in such areas.
Photoreceptors in plants exhibit diverse responses to specific light wavelengths, each governed by a distinct signaling pathway. These pathways activate different genes, giving rise to specific phenotypic traits. Notably, plants employ their plasma membrane or phase separation to detect temperature variations by monitoring the biochemical properties of the plasma membrane and specific cytoplasmic molecules. Intriguingly, photoreceptors also enable plants to perceive temperature changes, as their activation or deactivation is more pronounced at certain temperatures compared to others.
Plants respond to changes in CO2 levels by gauging the concentration of bicarbonate (HCO3-) in cells, which changes in relationship to changes in the partial pressure of CO2. Oxygen on the other hand is sensed through the N-degron pathway of oxygen sensing and the Group VII ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTORS ERFVIIs. High O2 levels leads to the oxidation of Cys2 amino acid in the ERVIIs, triggering degradation via the N-degron pathway and subsequent repression of hypoxia-related genes.
High altitude plants have evolved specific adaptations to thrive in their challenging habitats. These adaptations include heightened UV-B tolerance, optimal temperature and germination cues, increased stomatal density to enhance CO2 uptake, and heightened sensitivity to oxygen to repress hypoxia-related genes. These strategies hold promise for incorporation into staple crops, facilitating crop cultivation at higher altitudes. However, extensive research is necessary before translating these adaptations into practical applications."

Currently, biological control agents are rising in popularity as an alternative to conventional chemicals to prevent these negative outcomes. Plant symbiont and mycoparasite Trichoderma is a well-known biological control agent that antagonizes disease agents directly and enhances the plants own defense response. In this study it was investigated how the elicitors produced by Trichoderma induced an increased defense response in the plant against pathogenic microbes. It was shows that Trichoderma induces local defense mechanisms such as calcium influx, MAPK cascades, callose deposition, ROS-related defense and polyphenol synthesis. On the other side, Trichoderma also induces systemic defense in plants along the SA, ET and JA pathways. Lastly, several Trichoderma elicitors are discussed and what is currently known about their mode of action in the host plant.

Since it is a relatively new concept, many interpretations and ideas around this term exist but an uniform understanding of this concept is still missing. This research aims to provide this uniform understanding by presenting multiple perspectives into this topic and unite them into one, creating a new conceptual definition. Following this definition, a list of organizational characteristics is made to use as a foundation for a model where organizations can assess their level of organizational future-readiness. Incorporating evidence from literature, expert interviews and a multiple-case study, this research defines what a future-ready organization is. The
analysis of the design of other measurement models and their characteristics showed that organizations need to be measured on certain dimensions consisting of different maturity levels. A future-ready organization is one that has a high level of maturity in 4 dimensions, Adaptability, Digitalization, Culture and Strategy. With their underlying sub-characteristics, these dimensions are capable of positioning an organization’s ability to be prepared for what is about to come. The case studies evaluated the model and the characteristics and concluded that the model and characteristics were accurate and usable. Therefore the conclusion is that a future-ready organization is an organization that is capable of dynamically adapting to a constantly changing business environment while maintaining its ability to innovate and deliver value to its stakeholders. The organizational future-readiness is dependent on their ability to adapt, digitize, develop culture and strategic alignment."

It most commonly affects children aged £5 years, though it may rarely occur in older children, with 10% of cases ≥6 years. There appear to be differences in age-related groups. We combined clinical factors and molecular characteristics, which provides a comprehensive overview. Methods: Data was conducted within a multi-database system: Radboudumc and Emma Children’s Hospital from 2008 till 2014; Princess Maxima Center from 2014 till April 2023. Pathological and clinical records were obtained for molecular characteristics. We reviewed the medical records for clinical presentation, biochemical studies, treatment, and follow-up survival. Results: Higher proportion of female individuals were diagnosed with neuroblastoma (55.8% vs. 47.7%). Our study indicated a higher proportion of patients classified as high risk (83.7%). Our study revealed lower overall survival rates compared to those reported in the literature for both intermediate-risk disease (83.3% vs. >90%) and high-risk patients (41.9% vs. >50%). Immunotherapy was significantly associated with overall survival (p=0.008). We have found MYCN mutations in 16.3% of the cases. The LOH1p was close to significantly associated with overall survival (p=0.058) and event-free survival (p=0.085). The overall survival was not significantly associated with Risk groups (p=0.162), ATRX mutations (p=0.246), gain of 17q (p=0.250), age above 10 (p=0.296).

Recognizing the significance of informal markets in this context, the Resilient Cities Initiative endeavors to foster innovation in the effective management of urban food systems. As a part of this initiative, this study investigated the business challenges faced by small food vendors in Quezon City and Pasay, focusing on enhancing decent work opportunities through the development of Vendor Business Schools (VBS) in Metropolitan Manila. Through a comprehensive analysis, topics of interest and relevance to the vendors were identified, and practical aspects to foster alignment with local authorities were explored.
	Based on data collected from sixteen focus group discussions, the results indicate the primary business challenges faced by vendors, including income instability, the adverse impact of weather conditions, and a lack of business knowledge. Besides, the findings demonstrate the intricate interplay between these challenges and the socio-political field surrounding them, where challenges are greatly influenced by gender dynamics and city-specific operations. Drawing upon Practice Theory, this study emphasizes the importance of addressing the unique habitus and capital of different vendors within the inclusive development of a capacity building program.

"""Play More, Gain More?"": A Mixed-Method Study on Gaming and Student Well-Being, and the Role of Social Connectedness","['Duong, Ai Linh']","['Eijnden, R.J.J.M. van den']",2023-08-15T00:00:53Z,EN,['youth; gaming; problematic gaming; social relatedness; perceived social support; loneliness; time spent gaming; intensity'],Youth Studies,"Gaming is a popular leisure activity among youth, yet conflicting findings remain on the role of gaming in mental well-being. The present study investigated whether, and how, time spent on gaming (intensity) was linked to mental well-being outcomes in Dutch students using a mixed-method approach, and addressed the roles of problematic gaming and social relatedness. Findings of the national, cross-sectional survey of the “MMMS ” (N = 10,488) and multiple regression analyses suggested that spending more time on gaming was linked to lower outcomes of well-being in youth, even in non-problematic gamers. Furthermore, social relatedness (perceived social support and loneliness) influenced the association between intensity of gaming and mental well-being. This, however, was only present in youth who played more than 20 hours per week on average. The interviews (N = 6) proposed a complicated relationship between time spent on gaming and mental well-being, as social factors are a big motivation for youth to play games. Future interventions should therefore not focus on reducing gaming time in youth but facilitate better gaming experiences for youth by increasing awareness of behaviors as gaming still has the potential to improve mental well-being."

Sorption Experiments for Amphetamine-type Substances,"['Nishi, Takeru']","['Lutz, Stefanie']",2023-08-24T00:00:42Z,EN,['Illicit drugs; chemical waste; soil sorption; LCMS;  Isotherm; Freundlich'],Water Science and Management,"Dumping of illicit drug production waste, namely amphetamine-type substances (ATS), is an issue that Dutch authorities continually grapple with due to the concentrated production of such drugs in the Netherlands. This production waste is often discovered by happenstance, having been haphazardly and surreptitiously dumped into nature preserves or near surface water bodies. In the former case, drug waste containers may occasionally leak into the soil, potentially discharging high concentrations of ATS chemicals into the subsurface and posing a threat to groundwater contamination. This thesis set out to perform an array of soil sorption experiments that would provide empirical data that enhances the understanding of how these chemicals behave in the soil system. 

Sorption experiments were performed using a soil sample collected from the subsurface of the Utrechtse Heuvelrug, where the sampling location lie within 50 meters of a municipal drinking water well. A sorption methodology conducted on five ATS chemicals—MDMA, methamphetamine, APAAN, BMK, and safrole—at spike concentrations of 300, 150, 75, 37.5, 18.75, 9.38, 4.69, 2.35, and 1.17 μg/L provided the necessary data to develop sorption isotherms. 15 mL Cellstar® tubes containing a soil mass to spike solution ratio of 2 grams to 4 mL, performed in triplicate at each concentration, were laid flat and mixed for 48 hours in an orbital shaker operating at 130 rpm. Sample vials were then centrifuged at 3000 Gs for 30 minutes, after which the supernatant solutions passed through 0.20 μm Phenomenex syringe filters into 1.8 mL amber LCMS-safe analysis vials. 

LCMS sample analysis using an Vanquish LC pump and an Orbitrap Fusion provided equilibrium aqueous phase concentrations, Ce, which were then used to calculate the concentration of each test chemical sorbed to the soil phase, Cd. These values provided the necessary data to construct sorption isotherms that describe the sorption behavior of each compound in the soil sample. Experimental data indicate that the sorption of MDMA, methamphetamine, and APAAN are adequately described by the Freundlich model, as they exhibit nonlinear sorption with increasing equilibrium aqueous concentration. MDMA, methamphetamine, and APAAN Freundlich equations had 1/n values of 0.9046, 0.8415, and 0.5994, respectively, falling below the upper end of the nonlinear threshold value of 1/n=1. Freundlich coefficient values, KF, were 24.29 for MDMA, 7.51 for methamphetamine, and 207.1 for APAAN, demonstrating that these compounds exhibit notable sorption to the soil sample. Comparison of organic carbon normalized sorption values, logKFOC, of MDMA and methamphetamine to those of Pal et al. (2008) suggest that these sorption coefficients adequately describe the behavior of these chemicals in the soil (Pal et al., 2008). Data for BMK was insufficient for calculation of a Freundlich coefficient, but does show that sorption of BMK is orders of magnitude lower than it is for MDMA, methamphetamine, and APAAN. No data for safrole was available for analysis due to detection issues in the LCMS.

These experimental data indicate that sorption of ATS chemicals is variable depending on the individual compound and its chemical structure. MDMA and methamphetamine, based on the isotherm data and comparisons to literature, are likely to degrade in the soil before they would pose a threat to infiltration into the groundwater. APAAN had no degradation information available at the time of this research, but its high sorption affinity to the soil suggests that it will remain in the soil. Drawing definitive conclusions on environmental fate of BMK and safrole is not possible given the incomplete nature of their data. Altogether, this thesis provides empirically determined soil sorption values that are useful in expanding the understanding of ATS drug chemicals in Dutch soil."
Yield of tuberculosis screening among people with diabetes,"['Geuns, Dorine van']","['Wijgert, Janneke van de']",2023-08-24T00:00:48Z,EN,[],Epidemiology,"Diabetes is one of the fastest growing global health issues. Around 10% of the world has diabetes but it is expected that in 2045 there will be 800 million patients, mostly with type 2 diabetes. Because people are getting older and type 2 diabetes risk increases with age, this number increases so quickly. In developing countries, this rise of diabetes is happening even faster. Health systems need to adapt to this development. In 2021, almost half of people with diabetes were unaware they had the condition. This means we need to prevent and better manage chronic conditions such as diabetes. 
People with diabetes are more at risk of getting infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis. It is also more likely that they will suffer from poor disease and treatment outcomes. About a quarter of the world is infected with tuberculosis. To lower this number, we must prevent the disease from spreading. One suggested strategy is early detection of tuberculosis cases by screening. Since people with diabetes have a higher risk of developing disease and poor outcomes, it might be beneficial to screen them for tuberculosis. In this review, I assess how many cases are found when people with diabetes are screened for tuberculosis. 
The World Health Organization recommends several screening and diagnostic tests for accurate diagnosis. People can be screened using a tuberculosis-symptom questionnaire, chest-X-ray or bacteriological tests. 
I searched databases for recent studies that conducted screening programs among people with diabetes and then assessed how many tuberculosis cases these programs yielded. There were large differences among the eight included studies in design of screening programs and tests used. Most studies used a parallel screening program, where two different screening tests are done at the same time, usually chest-X-ray and symptom screening. After, people with possible tuberculosis are referred for bacteriological tests to confirm tuberculosis infection. 
The yield of screening was very low, but there were differences based on how high the tuberculosis burden is in the country. It ranged from 1 case per 10,000 people screened to 270 per 10,000. This suggests that it is probably not cost-effective and efficient to screen all people with diabetes for tuberculosis. For example, screening could for example only been done in people with diabetes with additional risk factors, such as poorly controlled glucose levels, or in countries where tuberculosis is more common. 
There are benefits of screening, such as early detection to prevent the disease from spreading and treating infected people adequately. However, there are also disadvantages, such as diagnosing people falsely due to incorrect tests results, which may lead to stress and unnecessary treatment. Screening is also high cost and labor intensive. 
Due to the low yield and unclear risk-benefit ratio of screening, future research should therefore assess what the best approach is for screening people with diabetes for tuberculosis. It might not be feasible to screen all people with diabetes, but cost-effectiveness studies should compare different approaches to screening, for example based on the risk of tuberculosis and poor outcomes."
The Politicization of a Security Culture: A Historical Analysis of the European Parliament’s Reaction to Russian Disinformation Regarding the 2014 Annexation of Crimea and the European Elections of 2019,"['Dam, Casper']","['Graaf, Beatrice de']",2023-08-24T00:00:51Z,EN,[],International Relations in Historical Perspective,"Over the past few years, disinformation has regained its significance in academic and societal debate. Similarly, the Russian use of disinformation in relation to its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 put disinformation on the radar of the European Parliament (EP). By analyzing the EP’s response to the Crimean case and to disinformation related to the 2019 European elections, this thesis shows that as a security culture, the EP gained a deeper understanding of disinformation since 2014. However, at the same time its response to the threat became politicized. A historical overview of Russian political culture (858-2019) and disinformation (1903-2019) is used to contextualize the two cases and to show how crucial the use of disinformation was in Russian ideology, and how important it thus was for the EP to find an effective strategy to counter it. The thesis suggests, however, that the politicized nature of the EP’s security culture made it more difficult to effectively identify and counter the threat. This thesis’ contribution to the academic debate, then, is twofold: firstly, it implies that a healthy security culture must be able to learn from history in order to deal with contemporary threats. Secondly, by being the first to use the security cultures framework on the EP, it provides the groundwork for further research into the EP’s security culture."
"Experiencing Nature in Food Forests in Utrecht: Building connection, affect, and emotional attachment with the more than human world","['Brander, Sabine']","['Wessels, Koen']",2023-08-24T00:00:46Z,EN,[],Sustainable Development,"Food forests can serve many functions, one of which is addressing nature estrangement in 
(semi)urban environments. The problem of nature estrangement is not so much caused by 
technology, urbanization, or even having less contact with nature, but by over-rationalisation, 
objectivization, suppressed emotions, and anthropocentrism. To reshape our relation to nature
we must first change the way we think about and perceive it. Therefore, I sought to answer the 
following question: in what ways can experiences of nature in food forests in Utrecht provide 
opportunities for creating connection, affect, and emotional attachment with the more than 
human world? To answer the research questions, I first conducted a literature review to 
explore the various theories and debates about the influence of environmental aesthetics on 
the perception people have of nature and their encounters with the natural environment. 
Somewhat simultaneously, I started working in a food forest near Utrecht. Through these 
personal experiences working in the natural environment, I could apply the theoretical 
concepts I had learned and build a framework from that, and guide my literature review based 
on my new understandings of the food forest. Lastly, in order to see if I could make the
framework useful and applicable to others, and try to gain further insights to deepen the 
framework further, I conducted three focus groups. In these focus groups I attempted to share 
my insights in a way that would enable the participants to engage in emotionally meaningful 
encounters with their environment. Through the focus groups three main criteria or 
circumstances were identified.
To conclude, the imagination framework I used was useful in facilitating emotionally 
meaningful encounters with the more than human world. In addition to the framework,
focusing on fostering ‘openness’ and ‘willingness’ in designing or shaping encounters with 
nature, proved essential for making these encounters successful in creating connection, affect, 
and emotional attachment. This dialogical aspect of the encounters, being both open to 
receiving and communicating on nature’s terms, and the willingness to take an active role in 
exploring and reaching out to the environment, demands a great deal from the people 
concerned. Therefore, special attention to how the design of these encounters can invite and 
aid in creating respectful, autonomous, and safe experiences is required. Only when these 
criteria were upheld and fostered was there an opportunity for creating connection, affect and 
emotional attachment with the more than human world around them.

teachers hold on to multicultural beliefs, and six express deficit thinking. Another finding was 
that three teachers did not always believe their teaching material was geared towards culturally

Differentiation in Post-secondary Vocational Education: Experiences of Teachers and Students,"['Brouwer, Ynke']","['Hornstra, T.E.']",2023-08-23T23:01:02Z,EN,[],Educational Sciences,"Prior research in primary and secondary education indicates that differentiation seems to be beneficial for students’ academic achievement. However, research on differentiation in vocational education seems to be lacking. Therefore, the current research aims to give insight into the experiences of PVE teachers and their students concerning differentiation. 
 	The present study tries to answer the research question in an exploratory way. Interviews were conducted with five teachers currently working in PVE. Additionally, five panel interviews with three students each were conducted in order to explore whether teachers reach their set goals. Results will be analysed by using the Grounded Theory, which involves open coding, axial coding and selective coding.
	Overall, findings from the interviews indicated that differentiation seems highly relevant in PVE. PVE-teachers use different differentiation strategies, which are mainly convergent, meaning that teachers aim to let students reach a minimum set of learning goals. Furthermore, teachers mentioned several hindering factors which prevent them from applying differentiation in the classroom. Time and differences between students in cognitive -and social skills are mentioned as hindering factors. When comparing teachers -and panel interviews within case, teachers and students commonly agreed upon differentiation. However, students mainly experience differentiated teaching when they ask for it in class.
To conclude, from the present study it can be stated that differentiation in PVE should obtain more attention from the educational field as the findings suggest that PVE-students might benefit from more differentiated teaching. However, more time, space and a systematic way of differentiation might be needed in PVE."

Energy efficiency and sustainability in residential properties are of increasing importance in addressing environmental concerns and reducing energy consumption. This study focuses on the relationship between energy labels and energy consumption in residential properties. Two datasets, the EP dataset and the Funda dataset, were utilized to analyze the potential cost savings associated with upgrading energy labels.
The aim was to determine the impact of energy label changes on primary fossil energy consumption and predict energy consumption based on relevant variables. Here we show that upgrading energy labels leads to a significant reduction in primary fossil energy consumption, with potential cost savings ranging from €19.73 to €123.78 per year. Linear regression model accurately predicts energy consumption and demonstrates the effectiveness of energy label improvements in achieving energy efficiency.
The findings highlight the importance of energy labels in promoting energy efficiency and provide insights for energy renovations in the future. This study contributes to the understanding of energy efficiency in the residential sector. Future research can expand to renovation loans and their interest rates to upgrade a residential home’s energy label to A.""""]"
Predicting Positive and Negative Ties in Signed Networks,"['Staals, Bo']","['Garcia Bernardo, Javier']",2023-09-06T09:40:22Z,EN,['Network analysis; signed networks; positive and negative ties; machine learning models; online and real world networks; Python'],Applied Data Science,"Network analysis is a growing area of research in various fields. While most existing studies focus on unsigned networks, this research explores the coexistence of positive and negative ties in signed online and real world networks. By combining topological features and social theories, this research investigates the gap in previous research. This leads to the following research question: ""To what extent can machine learning models predict positive and negative ties in online and real world networks?"" 

The network analysis is carried out on two signed networks. The Wikipedia network represents the online network, where every user is allowed to vote for other users that request for adminship. The school network represents the real world network and is based on data collected in the ""Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries"" project. The final datasets used for the classification model contain 4627 nodes and 122767 ties for the Wikipedia network and 4284 nodes and 27333 ties for the school network.

Snowball sampling has been performed to obtain subsets of the networks due to computational bottlenecks. The final feature set includes every connection between nodes, which can be either negative, not observed or positive. It also includes important metrics such as node-level, network-level, similarity-based, social theory and path-based metrics. After model selection, hyperparameter tuning and feature selection on the subsets, the final datasets are evaluated on the tuned Light Gradient Boosting Machine model. 

The results show that the school network outperforms the Wikipedia network in terms of F1, recall and precision in all classes except the not observed class. Reasons for this difference could be the imbalanced datasets and different network structures. The Wikipedia network has biased predictions towards the not observed class while the school network shows consistent performance. 

In conclusion, the real world network has a higher performance compared to the online network. We must keep in mind that comparing these networks is challenging due to the different network structure. Therefore, future research could compare more similar networks to obtain more generalisable results. In addition, it is important to overcome the problem of imbalanced data in order to obtain reliable and consistent results."

The aim is to analyze NDVI scores derived from Landsat 5 and 7 satellite imagery in the period from 1985 to 2020. The data preparation involves masking non-forest areas, applying cloud, cloud shadow, and snow masks, and rescaling the surface reflectance bands as well as normalizing them. An exploratory analysis of the data reveals an increasing trend in NDVI values over time. To determine the presence of a statistical trend, the Seasonal Mann-Kendall test is applied. The results indicate significant relationships between NDVI and time, demonstrating the potential for detecting changes in vegetation dynamics. Ethical considerations are addressed, highlighting the accessibility of the data and its freely available nature. Future research directions are suggested, including the incorporation of additional climate variables, the utilization of Landsat 4 and 8 data, and the exploration of leaf senescence dynamics.

This study explores whether individual ESG issues have sufficient informational power for investors, and in particular compares whether environmental risk is more relevant for investors compared to social risk, and whether more clear-cut issues such as corporate emissions and employee relations are more important than resource use and community relations. To study the pricing effects, sustainability factors are constructed in the form of long-short portfolios, based on ESG scores and are added to the Carhart common factor model. Formal asset pricing tests are performed to test for the models’ explanatory power and for the risk premia associated with the factors. Overall, results show that investors in the US require higher compensation for bearing sustainability risk, suggesting higher market efficiency. In line with expectations, environmental risk is proved to be more material for investors than social risk, in Europe requiring more than 2.3 times larger risk premium. Although, compared to expectations, on average, resource use and communities related performance are incorporated into stock prices to a higher extent than emissions and workforce, results are less significant and not consistent across tests, implying that individually they might not carry enough relevant information for investors."

Finally, crypto literacy and attitude towards cryptocurrencies were identified to positively affect the selection of crypto over non-crypto investments."
Pricing of Corruption Risk - U.S. Case Study for the Municipal Bond Market,"['Kqiku, Fatbardh']","['Huisman, Ronald']",2023-09-06T10:01:52Z,EN,[],Sustainable Finance and Investments,"Existing research suggests a positive relationship between corruption and bond yields. However, previous studies have overlooked two crucial aspects: the incomplete decomposition of pricing factors and the need for examining corruption at more localized levels, considering the decentralization of political power. This study investigates the extent to which municipal bonds price in corruption risk in the United States. Specifically, we examine the relationship between the corruption measure (Convictions per Capita) and annualized issuance cost, which comprises the yield to maturity and annualized gross spread—representing the sum of the cost of debt and the search costs incurred by underwriters. Our findings reveal a positive and significant association between annualized issuance costs and our corruption measure. Robustness checks largely support these results but also emphasize the necessity of conducting investigations over an extended period and utilizing multiple corruption measures to provide more comprehensive evidence.

Configurations of Sustainable Entrepreneurial Ecosystems: How To Support Entrepreneurship for Environmental and Social Development,"['Janssen, Joep']","['Schrijvers, Mirella']",2023-09-06T10:01:56Z,EN,['Sustainable Entrepreneurship; Sustainable Entrepreneurial Ecosystems; Environmental Entrepreneurship; Social Entrepreneurship; Sustainability; Entrepreneurial Ecosystems; Configurations for Entrepreneurial Ecosystems; Configurations for Sustainable Entrepreneurial Ecosystems;'],Business and Social Impact,"This paper is about Sustainable Entrepreneurial Ecosystems, which combines the Entrepreneurial
Ecosystem concept with the Sustainable Entrepreneurship concept, and looks at how a geographical

which conditions combine in a region to have either a high output or a high share of environmental or
social start-ups. The conditions looked at were incubators, sustainability education, impact investors,
sustainability awareness, governmental sustainability and economic development. This was analyzed
using the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) method on 273 NUTS-2 (European) regions. To
have a high output of either environmental or social start-ups, incubators and impact investors need to
be combined with either sustainability (environmental or social) awareness or GDP per capita. For the
output of social start-ups, a combination of impact investors, social awareness, governmental
sustainability and economic development is also sufficient. For a high percentage of environmental
start-ups, the combination of sustainability education, incubators and impact investors need to be
combined with a high GDP per capita, but also the absence of governmental sustainability. For a high
percentage of social start-ups the social awareness and governmental sustainability conditions are the
most important. These two conditions need to be combined with either the absence of incubators or the
absence of sustainability education. This shows that policy makers need to focus on different
conditions, depending on if they want to have more environmental or more social start-ups."

Due to the increased importance of human capital in today’s ‘knowledge-based economy’, competition for talent has reached new heights on the international stage. This has led to increased research into skilled labour migration but international students’, effectively new skilled labour in-training, migration decisions are still relatively under-researched considering the rise in student migration. This paper provides quantitative evidence for the findings of prior researchers whilst also providing a basis for future research on the phenomenon. Due to the high regard Dutch universities have achieved internationally, this is a gap which needs to be addressed to avoid the funding that has been put into Dutch universities becoming a ‘sunk cost’.
The paper begins with an explanation of the key motivations behind the study, followed by an overview of the identified antecedents, the conceptual model, and what can be anticipated based on the existing literature. Following this is a summary of the methodology, the results of which indicate that factors related to the job market, family support, length of stay and the level of effort to conform to the host country positively related to an intention to stay in the Netherlands, while efforts to obtain student facilities are negatively related. Limitations of the paper, as well as the implications these results could have for both stakeholders & theory are also presented."

findings are revealed using cross-sectional data on green bonds issued between

that green bonds issued by mission-oriented companies can offer lower yields
to investors. Furthermore, the results imply that bonds from repeat issuers
perform better, which is especially true for issuers with frequent issues. These
findings are consistent with the signaling argument commonly used in literature.
The demonstrated lower cost of capital could help scale up the corporate

Empirical evidence in this regard is, however, rather limited. With the aim of contributing to existing studies in this field, this thesis attempts to empirically assess network performance in the European multi-level governance system. Specifically, this study draws on previous theories and findings on governance networks to construct a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of network-specific attributes on performance in policy project implementation. The analysis focuses on the pivotal role of governance networks in executing EU-funded projects established to support SMEs’ green entrepreneurship and to advance EU policy development for environmental sustainability. By collecting empirical data through semi-structured interviews, this research uncovers interesting insights regarding the crucial calibration of collaborative dynamics, the cultivation of trust, the alignment of goals and the promotion of integrated relations within networks. In particular, the findings highlight how the interplay of these factors is essential to successfully maximise the potential and performance of governance networks in political processes. Addressing collaboration imbalances and ensuring alignment with regional, national, and supranational policies become a necessity for multi-actor configurations aiming to successfully implement EU initiatives and fully enhance their socio-political impact."

These flexible work arrangements have gradually evolved as the new normal in organizations particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, at the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) in Kenya, this evolution is evident in the embrace of teleworking and hybrid working. Due to the novelty of NWW, there has been little research on its psychological outcomes and underlying processes. More particularly, the psychological effects it has on individuals, as well as the elements that contribute to such effects, especially within the nuanced context of a developing country. Consequently, the aim of this study is to find out to what extent New Ways of Working (NWW) relate to employee burnout among the Kenyan National Health Insurance Fund Employees and how organizational support (training and provision of material resources) moderates this relationship. The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model and basic psychological needs (ABC) theory provides the theoretical framework. The results of the analysis from the surveyed NHIF employees (n=117) showcase non-significant findings (a) the anticipated positive relationship between NWW and burnout proves non-significant, (b) training and provision of material resources have no significant relationship with burnout, (c) both training and provision of material resources do not moderate the relationship between NWW and burnout. These are novel insights into the relationship between NWW and burnout in the setting of a developing country. The findings are evaluated, and discussed based on theory, and various suggestions for further research and practice are made."

Er wordt verwacht dat de concepten positieve, significante effecten hebben op organisatieleren (Zia et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2013). Ook wordt de modererende rol van fysieke nabijheid op de relatie tussen onderling vertrouwen en organisatieleren onderzocht. Er worden positieve effecten verwacht.

De data zijn verkregen uit 312 volledig ingevulde vragenlijsten afkomstig van kenniswerkers bij drie Nederlandse gemeenten. De hypothesen zijn getoetst via OLS- regressie analyses en middels Hayes’ macro mediatie model 14.

De resultaten laten zien dat transformationeel leiderschap een positief, significant effect heeft op organisatieleren. Daarnaast versterken affectief en cognitief vertrouwen de relatie tussen de twee concepten. Fysieke nabijheid heeft geen noemenswaardige invloed op de relatie tussen onderling vertrouwen en organisatieleren.

that employees need in their work environment. Supervisors have been recognized as one of the most 
prevalent sources of support for their subordinates, yet research on the supervisor support needs of 
employees is limited. The scientific and practical ambiguity in the identification of these needs and 
examination of their (un)satisfaction broadens when they are viewed under the prevalent hybrid work 
environments. This study aims to identify the support needs that employees develop in a hybrid working 
environment and to examine whether and in which ways these needs are satisfied or remain unsatisfied
by their supervisors. Further, this paper will explore the reasons that could explain the (un)fulfilment 
of employees' support needs whilst working hybridly.

In order to investigate the areas that employees require support in a hybrid setting, this paper first 
explores previous literature on hybrid work, supervisor support, employees' needs from their managers 
as well as supervisors' support capacities. In the examination of the employees’ support needs and 
supervisors’ support supplies the theory of Person-Supervisor Fit (PS) is employed. Through this 
theory, the present study investigates if and how hybrid workers' needs fit or misfit their supervisors’ 
support capacities. In addition, the theories of PS Fit and specifically Value (in)congruence, Leadermember exchange, as well as the theories of (Un)Shared perceptions, and Climate strength enrich the 
examination of the reasons that could explain the abovementioned fit/misfit situations. This research 
takes place in a telecommunications company in the Netherlands. The method that this paper adopts is 
qualitative research using interviews with employees and focus groups with supervisors in order to 
explore the above subjects. 

The findings of this research show that the predominant needs that employees have from their 
supervisors while working hybridly are communication, work-life balance, and trust. The participants
in some instances considered the support provided in the areas of communication and work-life balance 
as insufficient, however, in most cases, employees perceived that the supervisor support provided to 
them was satisfactory. The most prominent reason for the lower level of person needs-supervisor 
supplies fit or even misfit is value incongruence, and poor LMX, whilst fit was explained because of 
value congruence and good Leader-member exchange relationships. Finally, this research emphasizes 
the multiple dimensions that the (un)satisfaction of employees’ supervisor support needs entails and 
areas where future research could provide more insights."
Estimating problem shifting from the Minamata Convention on Mercury,"['Jans, Sem']","['Kim, Rak']",2023-09-12T00:00:43Z,EN,['Minamata Convention; Mercury; Problem shifting; Impacts'],Sustainable Development,"The challenge of global environmental governance lies largely in implementing effective solutions to environmental problems as articulated in multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). Whilst these agreements aim to resolve their own problems, their implementation can generate new problems which may impact other people, places, and time, a phenomenon referred to as problem shifting. The assessment of problem shifting originating from multilateral environmental agreements has not been examined in a systematic manner. In this study, a first step is taken by assessing the Minamata Convention, an MEA tasked with the management of anthropogenic mercury emissions. To allow for a comprehensive assessment of the occurrence of problem shifting from the measures taken by countries to implement the Convention, national reports were used to extract over 1100 implementation measures, which were categorized into over 100 distinct types, based on the source of mercury, and type of measure implemented. These measures are then thoroughly examined against environmental literature to determine the nature of new problems that they have created. For instance, the identified measure regarding the prohibition of dental amalgam displaces the problem due to the increased occurrence and cost of restorative actions needed, resulting in financial and health complications for consumers. This analysis has identified eight measures that cause problem-shifting, generating problems in issue streams related to temporal and locational shifts in mercury and product management. Ultimately, the implementation of the Convention is hindered through costly systemic transformations and an overly simplified view of mercury management, resulting in the continuous degradation of environmental and human health, particularly for those of lower income. This assessment of problem shifts largely outlines the various types of shifts, the mechanisms through which they occur, and the impacts of the shifts. These results undermine the need for preventative and responsive measures to be established within MEAs, to avoid and mitigate the occurrence of such shifts. The methodology provided in this research may also be applied to the assessment of other agreements."

In Mexico, civil society organizations work toward goals of food sovereignty through the ‘defense of corn,’ aiming to both prohibit transgenic corn on a policy level and support campesino (farmer, peasant) preservation of native varieties. This research highlights civil society networks as intermediaries in the distinctive but interacting claims to (food) sovereignty made by the state and campesino communities. By exploring the role of corn as both an economic and relational entity, in the lives, livelihoods and cultures that surround it, this study aims to take food seriously as a site through which sovereignty is claimed. Sovereignty is revealed to encompass not only interactions between the state, its citizens, and transnational actors, but also the assertion of community agency over their bodies, environments, and community dynamics. This builds upon decolonial conceptualizations of sovereignty, brought forth by Bonilla (2017) and Bryant and Reeves (2021), further moving toward a multispecies approach in which affective relationships to corn are centered in campesino claims to sovereignty. The propensity of civil society networks to connect traditional knowledge systems with science offers a vision through which food sovereignty might answer calls from anthropologists and Indigenous academics to hold these worldviews together not only for a just future of food, but for a more meaningful ideal of sustainability."

In the debate on explicit vs implicit instruction, there are those studies supporting that explicit instruction is more effective than implicit instruction (Norris & Ortega, 2000; Spada & Tomita, 2010), those supporting that implicit instruction yields long-lasting results by focusing not only on accuracy but also on fluency and complexity (Piggott, 2019; Rousse-Malpat, 2019), and those supporting a type of teaching that does not entirely exclude, in a way, either one of the two (Lantolf & Tsai, 2018; Long & Rothman, 2013). The present study focuses on the move from the lab to the classroom and asks what the effectiveness is of explicit grammar teaching as it is done in actual classrooms, and how students actually integrate grammar structures and rules into their own knowledge and understanding of language use. 
18 Greek high school students learning the contrast between the passé composé and the imparfait in French participated in this study. The innovative aspect of the study lies in the collaborative nature of the task students were asked to perform, allowing for the students' discussions to be analyzed to get an insight into their past tense choices.
Results show great support for the effectiveness of explicit language learning, while the students' production choices do not always depend on the instruction provided in the classroom. The study calls for a replication in a classroom of implicit instruction, with larger student samples or similar populations with a different L2 or of a different language proficiency level."

Virtual reality provides an opportunity to create a three-dimensional environment in order to present stimuli at different distances. We here developed a pupillometric test in a VR environment to examine pseudoneglect at four different distances (30cm, 70cm, 120cm, and 700cm). 34 healthy participants were instructed to complete a VR eye-tracking experiment where stimuli at each distance, participants were presented with a white/black or black/white display to elicit pupil light responses that have been proposed to capture pseudoneglect across depth. The findings did not demonstrate a significant leftward attention bias in healthy participants. Moreover, viewing distance did not influence the multitude of the leftward bias. Future studies are required to replicate current experiment using the VR eye-tracking technique."

This paper examines perception of algorithmic and human-made forecasts and its potential influence on associated decision making in situations of uncertainty. Two groups of participants were given the same set of hypothetical choice problems with embedded in them probabilistic forecasts. One group was presented those forecasts as made by human experts and the second group was told that the forecasts were made by AI. Every choice problem proposed an option that participants must accept or reject. The objective of this study was to observe preferability of choice options in Human and AI conditions depending on the forecasts’ framing (positive or negative), confidence level (high, medium, low) and decision domain (serious or trivial). We found that in general AI-made forecasts receive less “yes” answers to the choice problems than human-made forecasts. Overall, the framing and confidence levels affected the probability of a “yes” response. However, only the framing showed different magnitude of the phenomena in AI and Human condition indicating an interaction between those two factors. No main effect was discovered for the decision domains of the questions. Additionally, a trust scale revealed higher trust levels towards a human expert when compared to trust in AI. These findings contribute to the psychology human-AI interaction and decision making under uncertainty and suggest that people see algorithmic predictions as lacking trustworthiness."

easily articulated vocally or put into writing, building this knowledge as a researcher added a new 
understanding of making processes for the field of anthropology. In conclusion, wool working is a 
network consisting of different actants (actor-network theory), dependent on the materiality of 
wool. Makers build a relationship with materials through making processes, in which they embody 
the knowledge of the craft by makers. Therefore, this knowledge is stored in bodies, not in words. 
To transfer the relationship with wool, wool workers share their craft with others through practice, 
as well as by telling stories through the products they make."

Focusing on the interconnected and globalized society, it specifically examines the experience of potential loss or compromise to one's moral status within an intergroup dialogue. A sample of 50 students (25 dyads) participated in a controlled lab study where each dyad discussed the usage of Dutch and English languages within higher education, a contentious topic in the contemporary academic landscape. Both psychological (self-reported anxiety) and physiological (heart rate) measures of stress were obtained. Results indicated a significant increase in heart rate during the discussion compared to the baseline, suggesting an engagement of participants in the task. However, the anticipated relationships between moral identity threat, group identification, and stress responses (self-reported anxiety and heart rate) were not significant. The study adds to the body of literature on moral identity and stress responses in intergroup dynamics, albeit with null findings, and underscores the complexity of these relationships. It brings forth a range of methodological strengths, such as the incorporation of an intercultural perspective and controlled environment, while also highlighting limitations including the modest sample size and homogeneity, as well as potential issues with the moral identity threat measure. The findings underscore the importance of future research to further understand the complex interplay between moral identity threat, group identification and stress responses in diverse societal settings, which could aid in promoting inclusive environments and well-being."

Existing research in the rights of nature discourse has primarily centered around marginalized groups' resistance for nature's rights, with limited exploration of the consequences and implications of realizing these rights for daily life. This study fills this gap by examining how the realization of these rights shapes the lives of La Esperanza's residents. The relationship between the residents, the river, and the municipality has undergone significant changes. Processes of truth-production and problematization (Foucault 1980; Li 2007) have turned the river into a legal political tool, shaping the perception of the river's contamination, creating misconceptions about the residents. Different stakeholders exploit the river for their own purposes, leaving those without resources voiceless. For the residents, El Río Monjas its vibrant materiality (Bennett 2010) has changed from a source of life into a monster, a ruinous vibrancy (Wilhelm-Solomon 2017).

It aims to ascertain how these works, as examples of the increasingly popular African gothic genre, demonstrate resistance against the intersectional oppressions that constitute Black womxn’s identity. These novels similarly engage with Nigerian cosmologies surrounding twins, souls, abiku/ogbanje spirits, and different manifestations of Black womxn’s power, in the negotiation of identity as British-Nigerian subjects; and both follow the lives of female, ‘half and half’ children, who are caught between Africa and the UK. By reclaiming control over cultural production and merging traditional African cosmologies with the Western gothic
tradition, these authors acknowledge the rich cultural history and narrative traditions of Nigeria and invite readers to consider alternate social realities than those perpetuated by Western thought. Ultimately, they undermine the centrality of such oppressive Western constructs, and enact resistance against their intersectional oppressions. Close-reading analysis of the texts exposes the presence of multiple forms of resistance in the rewriting of time, space, and Otherness, rather than merely the elucidation of fears, as in the traditional gothic manner. Effectively, the novels challenge colonialist conceptions of power and privilege which position the African womxn as the ultimate Other and, thus, they constitute acts of cultural resistance."

With box office successes like Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) and Rocketman (2019) the biopic is booming. However, academic research on this genre is limited. The available studies moreover tend to focus on the biopics’ historic (in)accuracy. Yet, biopics are cinematic texts and should therefore be examined as such. An intriguing element of the music biopic, are the reenactments of historical music performances. This filmic practice allows the spectator to experience events from the past somatically and emotionally. To create a realistic experience for the spectator, reenactments started to rely upon the remediation of the (audio-visual) documents of historical performances. At the same time, they became interwoven into the films’ story world. Within this dual function lies the main question of this thesis: “How do the reenactments of historical music events in Elvis simultaneously create an “realistic” experience for the viewer and contribute to the films’ narrative?” This question will be answered through an in-depth audio-visual analysis of four historical music performance reenactments in biopic Elvis (2022). Elvis (dir. Baz Luhrmann) tells the (his)story of Elvis Presley through the eyes of his manager Tom Parker and relies upon the remediation of multiple historical media documents (e.g. photographs, television broadcasts, documentaries) making this a suitable case study. The analysis will 1) focus on the relationship between the old medium the reenactment is based on, and how this is translated into the new medium considering camerawork, editing, mise-en-scène, voice-over/dialogue and music and 2) consider the narrative connotations and associations that are established. Additionally, literature from film studies, musicology and performance studies will be combined, to give insight in the remediation and restructuring of history in the contemporary biopic as cinematic text and move beyond the limiting debate of historic accuracy."
"Surveillance Capitalism: The Harm to Childhood, The Insufficiency of Parental Consent And The Consequent Impermissibility","['Elstub, Emily']","['Anderson, Joel']",2023-01-10T00:00:33Z,EN,[],Applied Ethics,"Today, children are embedded actors in an unprecedented economic system called surveillance capitalism. It profits from exploiting their data to manipulate and direct their future behaviour. What’s more, this economic system is not inherently unlawful. According to current legislation, though children cannot themselves consent, if parental consent is given, surveillance capitalism in the lives of children is permissible. In this paper I show that the current legislation allows for outcomes that are morally wrong. I first cast doubt on the possibility of valid parental consent by challenging whether, in the context of surveillance capitalism, consent can really ever be properly informed. I then show that even if valid parental consent is possible, it is not sufficient to be morally transformative. Considering a wider set of contexts, I argue that parental consent is sufficient for an action only if the benefits associated with that action surpass the risks for the child. Building on an authorship-based account of what it means to ‘be a child’, I then show that the benefits of surveillance capitalism do not surpass the risks because this economic system both interferes with a child’s development of authorship and fails to reflect their absence of authorship. Parental consent, for surveillance capitalism, is therefore insufficient."

As an ethnoterritorial interstate dispute between Christian Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis, the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict is an intriguing case study from the perspective of instrumentalization of Islamic discourses. This research, thus, attempts to explore whether and how Islamic rhetoric has evolved since the 1980s, when the Conflict erupted upon the rubbles of the godless Soviet Union, until the most recent war of 2020. While the peculiarities of Azerbaijani Islam are thoroughly discussed in this research to demonstrate how they relate to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, a particular emphasis is put on illustrating the Islamic discourses surrounding the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War of 2020. Furthermore, this thesis draws on important Islamic concepts like Islamic Solidarity and Ummah to analyze how Islam ‘mattered’ in this ongoing ethno-territorial conflict. Using discourse and media analyses as well as historical approaches, this research investigates the ways Islam entered the Conflict and gradually became more involved in it, reaching its ‘Islamic peak’ in the Second Nagorno-Karabakh war of 2020. As for theoretical contributions, this research attempts to look at the contemporary Azerbaijani politics from a ‘post-secular’ light, thus challenging the discourse that post-secular perspectives are only applicable to modern Western societies. Moreover, I critically reflect on the notion of Azerbaijanis’ orinetalization within the Nagorno- Karabakh Conflict, adding to the existing theory on this intriguing discourse."
The importance of proteoglycans in articular cartilage,"['Deenichina, Polina']","['Gawlitta, Debby']",2023-01-07T01:00:56Z,EN,['hyaline; articular cartilage; proteoglycans; osteoarthritis'],Regenerative Medicine and Technology,"The human body experiences a wide variety of stresses from loading produced by its own weight or external forces such as gravity. To prevent any damage to the bones, especially during movement, nature has designed special cushioning that is called hyaline cartilage. Hyaline is primarily found at the tips of long bones that make up our limbs, also referred to as articular cartilage. The major function of articular cartilage is to absorb shock and to lubricate the bones during movement. This specific function of hyaline is underlied by its composition. A major player in hyaline cartilage are large molecules that are called proteoglycans: ‘proteo’ meaning protein and ‘glyco’ meaning sugar. These molecules can attract and retain water inside the cartilage which gives it its shock-absorbing properties. In addition to the proteoglycans, there is a network of strands that can be aligned or randomly dispersed within the cartilage. This network provides structure and stiffness to the hyaline, and together with the proteoglycans determine cartilage functions. In this mini-review the major types of proteoglycans and their roles in hyaline were summarised. Moreover, hyaline proteoglycans were compared to proteoglycans in other types of cartilage such as mature or diseased cartilage."

Uit voorgaande onderzoeken blijkt dat leerlingen meer leesplezier ervaren bij veel keuzevrijheid en een ervaringsgerichte didactiek. Voor het begeleiden van keuzevrijheid en het geven van ervaringsgerichte didactiek lijkt een docent over repertoirekennis te moeten beschikken. Daarom wordt er in dit onderzoek gekeken of er een relatie is tussen de repertoirekennis van jeugdliteratuur van onderbouwdocenten en de manier waarop deze docenten hun literatuuronderwijs inrichten. Voor de inrichting van literatuuronderwijs is gekeken naar de keuzevrijheid die geboden wordt bij de boekkeus van de leerlingen en de voorkeur die leraren hebben voor ervaringsgerichte didactiek. Om deze repertoirekennis te meten, de mate van keuzevrijheid te meten en te zien welke didactische voorkeur docenten is er een enquête afgenomen onder 89 onderbouwdocenten. De resultaten laten zien dat gemiddeld zeventien van de veertig gevraagde jeugdliteratuurboeken door de deelnemende docenten zijn gelezen. Daarnaast werden er nog gemiddeld negen van de veertig boeken door de deelnemende docenten herkend zonder te zijn gelezen. De resultaten tonen een verband aan waarbij de keuzevrijheid significant toeneemt wanneer de docent meer boeken heeft gelezen. Verder toont deze studie aan dat de voorkeur voor ervaringsgerichte didactiek significant toeneemt wanneer de docent meer boeken heeft gelezen. De resultaten suggereren dat docenten meer belezen moeten zijn in jeugdliteratuur, wanneer zij leesplezier onder leerlingen willen bevorderen.

In humans the class I elements, LINE1, Alu and SVA, are still capable of moving via reverse transcriptase activity, also called ‘retrotransposition’. However, only LINE1 elements are autonomous, as only a small subset of LINE1 express the required proteins which facilitate retrotransposition of all three types of ME. Normally, retrotransposition is repressed, but can be lifted during embryonal development or in cancer. The resulting ME insertions (MEIs) can affect gene function or cause structural variants (SVs). Research into somatically occurring MEIs and tools to detect them are limited: Whilst MEIs has been observed to occur somatically in adult cancer, no extensive investigation has been performed in pediatric cancer yet. Therefore, the goal of our study was to assess the frequency of somatic MEIs in our pediatric solid tumor cohort and the reliability of tools to detect them. To this end, we first benchmarked a set of tools using simulated somatic MEIs before running the best combination of tools on a cohort of paired WGS pediatric cancer patients. Somatic MEIs were seen to occur rarely in a low number of patients in a randomized pattern over the tumor genome. Nevertheless, we observed some insertions that caused translocations or affected cancer genes. Patients with osteosarcoma were particularly affected by MEIs compared to patients with one of the other tumor types. Therefore, while most insertions are passenger mutations, some might have the potential to drive tumor development. We thus show that somatic MEI are difficult to detect but are active in pediatric cancers at a low rate."

This thesis aims to contribute to the discussion from a spatial-temporal perspective and produce situated knowledge by zooming into the urbanist art practice in Guangzhou, China. Embarking on Israeli artist Omer Fast’s The Invisible Hand, a multimedia experience in 3DVR commissioned by Guangdong Times Museum in 2018, it thinks with an unfolding space-making project and explores how it creates circuits with Guangzhou’s urban transformation. It draws upon Gilles Deleuze’s understanding of virtuality, looking at Fast’s work as a crystal image and thus exploring art’s potential in re-assembling the urban sphere. Deleuze thinks of reality as the entwinement between the actual and the virtual, and time as the intrinsic property of space, the philosophy of which has been echoed in contemporary theories of cinema and architecture and arts and society at large. In the light of Deleuze, Walter Benjamin, Arie Graafland and Deborah Hauptmann, and Donna Haraway, I present a performative analysis of The Invisible Hand’s configuration of the actual and virtual, in which the economic reform, urban expansion, pursuit of happiness, gentrification and identity reconstruction that take place in Guangzhou are weaved into the visitor’s experience of reality. In the same process, it asks for attention to media technologies and urban infrastructures, raising the urgency of approaching the urban through its multiplicities. In the examination of its coalescence with the urban sphere and its deconstructive and germinating potential, I consider that the work opens up a dialogue of identity, public space, and the role of art in the urban. In the end, I propose a reciprocal relationship between art and the city."
Between Two Worlds,"['Sonderen, Casper']","['Mavrodin, Corina']",2023-01-10T01:00:59Z,EN,['Eastern Europe ; Buffer state ; Normative power ; Sphere of influence ; Policy incentive'],International Relations in Historical Perspective,"The presented study looks at pivots in the foreign policy of buffer states. Some countries have lost that status after opting relatively quickly for an international sphere of influence. By looking at the cases of Belarus and Ukraine, this research has helped to provide insights into what has influenced pivots in the foreign policy of former buffer states. The results of these case studies show that pivots are significantly influenced by international normative power. Sanctions and territorial annexations push states away from the initiator, while incentives through political and economic benefits show positive effects.

Policy documents and statements by international actors indicate that in the Belarus case, president Lukashenka and normative power both played a major role in choosing Russia as the main international partner. Opting for that side allowed the president to realise his aspirations to consolidate power, which was impossible to combine with the norms and values of the European Union. Simultaneously, the EU halted all diplomatic negotiations with Belarus. It provided too few economic or political reasons for Lukashenka to abandon his quest for more domestic power. On the other hand, Russia was not so bothered by this. It saw opportunities and in turn did offer political and economic deals. As for the Ukraine case, the results of policy documents and a discourse analysis show that Russia was not keen on Ukraine's aspirations to integrate with Europe. Russia decided to take advantage of the emerging political instability and polarisation in Ukraine, and annexed Crimea. This annexation, combined with harsh Russian diplomacy drove Ukraine towards the European Union, which this time stood ready with treaties and agreements. Again, the results show that normative power with a negative approach pushes countries away, and positive incentives instead attract countries.

This research contributes to a deeper understanding about the actions of buffer states and, in particular, the loss of that status. It shows the role and use of international normative power and how that strategy may or may not achieve its goals, particularly for the cases of Belarus and Ukraine."

Effort has been taken to quantify the total volume of supraglacial meltwater with optical remote sensing. However, the requirement for in-situ measurements and tuning for each hydrological feature keeps the method from scaling to an automated ice-sheet wide solution. The ICESat-2 altimeter photon retrieval product provides high resolution (0.7m footprint) height estimates over the Greenland ice sheet at regular intervals (90 day revisit time). The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) onboard ICESat-2 returns both photons reflected from the water surface and the lake bottom which allows for depth retrieval. In this thesis a method is proposed to classify the ATL03 photon returns as surface and bottom photons leveraging an iterative Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) approach. The photon classifications yield estimates for the surface and lake bottom heights across the complete ICESat-2 track and a lake classification based on the slope of the surface and the estimated depth. Extrapolation of the along-track depths across the Greenland ice sheet, using Sentinel-2 optical imagery, is investigated. For extrapolation a generalized form for an empirical, physical and machine learning technique are considered. The lake classification, as compared to Sentinel-2 lake detection has an accuracy of 97.8% and provides consistent and smooth depth estimates over the complete ICESat-2 track. Extrapolation of the depth estimates using a random forest regressor shows an out-of-sample R2 of 0.7 with an RMSE of 1.54 across the complete validation set. The results suggest that DBSCAN clustering of ICESat-2 altimeter data can yield consistent and accurate depth estimates that can be used in a generalized method to estimate lake depths across the entire Greenland ice sheet with a
low error margin and small computational overhead."
Numerical comparison of some dimension reduction techniques for time series data from PDEs,"['Afzal, Rabia']","['Frank, Jason']",2023-01-05T01:00:50Z,EN,[],Mathematical Sciences,"There has been increasing use of dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques to deal with high dimensional data in order to minimize the number of dimensions, referred to as the number of variables or degrees of freedom. These techniques are applied to the data prior to modeling and give insight into the data, help reduce storage space required, and improve the computational cost of the models, due to reducing the number of variables. In extreme cases, some partial differential equation (PDE) solutions may be characterized by a finite number of degrees of freedom (or variables). In this thesis, four DR techniques, namely empirical orthogonal function,
diffusion maps, extended dynamic mode decomposition, and approximated Lax pairs, will be used for data sets formed from the approximating solution sequence of the two different PDEs. The idea of using the spectral theory for dimensionality reduction will be deployed to form the basis set presented as the set of the coordinates for the DR methods. The main motivation is to analyze and compare the four DR techniques. Consequently, it will be presented which DR method indicates the best approximation of the original data set for both types of data under the mean squared error criterion, in contrast to other methods."
Investigating Operation Challenges of IoT Systems to Improve the Usability through User Interface Design,"['Buwalda, Isa']","['Kosch, T.A.']",2023-01-03T01:00:59Z,EN,['IoT; usability; UX; user interface design; design criteria; SUS; AttrakDiff'],Human-Computer Interaction,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has been a rapidly expanding network in recent years and widely studied. However, many scholars focus on the technological features of the IoT network. Nevertheless, challenges still arise regarding usability and user experience (UX) of the systems in this network, especially in the consumer domain of IoT. The current study assessed those challenges by conducting a literature review. To confirm these challenges, a prestudy was conducted with ten participants that interacted with an IoT system. Results showed that the most important issues arise due to the lack of standardization amongst IoT systems, interoperability problems, the complexity of the systems, and the lack of feedback in them. 

Next, criteria for the design of user interfaces of IoT systems were proposed to overcome the IoT network-related challenges. These criteria were implemented in the IoT system that was used in the prestudy. To test the effect of these criteria, another study was conducted with ten participants that interacted with the system. The System Usability Scale (SUS) showed that the usability of the system had increased significantly. The AttrakDiff results demonstrated a non-significant increase of UX. Furthermore, the qualitative results of the interviews also suggested an increase in UX. 

The study thus offers new insights into designing user interfaces of IoT systems that are usable for consumers. Future work could replicate the study with a larger and more diverse sample size to generalize the results to a larger population. Furthermore, it would be interesting to investigate ways to standardize the development of IoT systems amongst companies developing IoT by making the suggested design criteria the norm."
Estimating chlorophyll-a concentrations in rivers through analysis of hyperspectral PRISMA imagery,"['Rooij, Joris de']","['Jong, Steven de']",2023-01-03T01:01:06Z,EN,"['Remote sensing, river water quality, PRISMA, chlorophyll-a']",Earth Surface and Water,"It is important to monitor the water quality of rivers, as people are dependent on this source of fresh water, and all other services rivers provide. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration is an important indicator for a proper quality of water and eutrophication. Hyperspectral satellite imagery can be used to estimate chl-a concentration in surface water, but methods for this have mostly been applied to large water bodies, like lakes, estuaries, and oceans. The aim of this research was to investigate how medium spatial resolution, hyperspectral PRISMA imagery can be used for estimating and monitoring water quality of rivers and at what accuracy. For this, two existing chl-a concentration algorithms, a band-ratio algorithm (Gurlin et al., 2011) and a normal difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) algorithm (Mishra & Mishra, 2012), both using PRISMA bands 34 (665nm) and 38 (709nm), were used. These algorithms were validated using a local chl-a concentration and reflectance dataset (n=11) of the Danube-Sava confluence. These algorithms were also recalibrated and validated using this same dataset to investigate if the results improve. The original Mishra and Mishra NDCI algorithm had the overall best performance, with a NMAE of 0.07 and a NRMSE of 0.09. It was possible to map spatial patterns of chl-a in rivers with qualitative concentration estimates and to refine that into quantitative estimates with a certain uncertainty range. The performance of both algorithms did not improve after recalibration. Large-scale sources of chl-a in rivers, like larger tributaries, could be deduced from the chl-a distribution maps, showing that the Danube has a higher chl-concentration than the Sava before the confluence. The (limited) mixing of water at the confluence and the distribution of chl-a after the confluence could be observed and interpreted. Small scale sources of chl-a, like wastewater outlets, could not be deduced in this research as the spatial resolution of the chl-a distribution maps was still too high compared the small and localized chl-a influx of these sources. With further validation of the Mishra and Mishra NDCI algorithm using a more extensive dataset, these methods could be developed into an automated monitoring system, as medium resolution hyperspectral imagery is suitable for estimating and monitoring the water quality of rivers."

in totaal. Daarnaast blijkt uit dit onderzoek het belang van de gevoelswaarde van specifieke
scheldwoorden voor het gehele effect van de tekst. Welke scheldwoorden een bepaald
personage gebruikt, heeft invloed op de manier waarop de lezer dit personage ziet. Dit verschil
in taalgebruik is dus belangrijk om in vertaling over te nemen. Een andere belangrijke factor
bij het vertalen van scheldwoorden is de acceptatie ervan in de bron- en doelcultuur. Nederland
kent een vrij grofgebekte cultuur, net zoals Schotland, maar in tegenstelling tot de VS. Als men
dan een tekst wil creëren die als net zo grof wordt ervaren in de doelcultuur als de brontekst in
de broncultuur, zal men hiervoor moeten compenseren door bijvoorbeeld scheldwoorden met
een heftigere gevoelswaarde te gebruiken in de vertaling."

It was also the first colonial war in Dutch history that caused so much debate about its legitimacy and its necessity. Therefore, this thesis focuses on how the Dutch officials tried to securitize the first expedition of the Aceh War towards the Dutch Parliament in 1873 by making use of Securitization Theory. The Dutch Parliament formed the formal audience that could exercise substantial influence on the extraordinary measures taken by the state and security decisions in general. In order to solve the puzzle, this thesis uses a substantial amount of secret correspondence from colonial officials and parliamentary proceedings from 1873. The Dutch officials framed an incident whereby the Acehnese sought foreign allies into the ‘Acehnese betrayal’. In turn, this was utilized as the casus belli for the war and it fostered a feeling of urgency to prevent another Western power from claiming Aceh before the Dutch could. The thesis argues that the Minister of Colonies, Fransen van de Putte, adjusted the frames and arguments within his pleas to his target audience. He framed the Acehnese Sultanate into a threat for the safety of the Dutch colonial empire and the only measure left against it was war. While justifying the war, the Minister used multiple tactics: he used a broad pallet of political, international and economical threats, he appealed to emotions in his pleas and he made use of historical threats and the history of the hostile bilateral relations to help his audience make the connection between Aceh and danger. Throughout the Ministers pleas and correspondence, he tried to frame the war as inevitable and just but imperialistic speech was also present which indicates an imperialistic character of the war."

conditions to safely dissipate excess light energy into heat. This mitigates the production of radical oxygen
species (ROS) and the photooxidative damage of thylakoidal proteins. The PsbS protein is a key
component of NPQ in higher order plant photosynthesis. Higher plants’ thylakoid membranes are
characterized for being enriched in Photosystem II (PSII) and light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) which
together form the PSII-LHCII supercomplex (PSII-LHCII sc) and form stacked structures in the grana. Under
excess light conditions, the thylakoid lumen acidifies activating PsbS which mediates light-regulated
interactions in the PSII-LHCII sc leading to its macroorganization and causing structural changes in the
grana stacks. The light-dependent conformational changes of PsbS and its interactions with PSII and LHCII
components are still largely unknow. Additionally, it has been shown that altering NPQ could have
significant implications in crop engineering to increase plant productivity. This makes understanding the
dynamic behavior of PsbS and the photosynthetic structures it interacts with of great interest. In this
project, we aim to extract structural details of the PsbS conformation and its interactions with the PSIILHCII sc under NPQ-inactive (dark) and NPQ-active (light) states. To achieve this, we make use of
crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) structural proteomics approaches and molecular modelling. We
also explore the incorporation of structural evolutionary predictions, via AlphaFold 2 and Evolutionary
couplings, to complement the experimental data. Our results show that we find dimeric PsbS under both
dark and light conditions with different conformations in its N-termini. Moreover, we use the XL-MS data
to build a structural model which shows that PsbS, Lhcb6 and the LHCII moderately bound trimers
disassociate together from the PSII-LHCII sc under NPQ conditions."

Het 
scriptieonderzoek focust zich in het bijzonder op het gebruik en hanteren van consent in de 
performer-crew arbeidsrelatie tijdens opnames van pornografische content. De aanleiding van deze 
scriptie is de film Pleasure (2021) geregisseerd door Ninja Thyberg. Thyberg wilde met de film specifiek 
nadruk leggen op de gevolgen van het geven van consent. Deze geportretteerde wisselwerking tussen 
wet en ervaring omtrent consent binnen Pleasure vormt daarmee het uitgangspunt van het 
scriptieonderzoek. Het vraagstuk wat hierbij centraal staat binnen het onderzoek is op welke manier 
consent kan bijdragen aan een veiligere werkomgeving op een pornografische filmset. Deze scriptie behelst een literatuuronderzoek naar de pornografische industrie, oftewel een 
media industrie. Er wordt ingegaan op verscheidene wetenschappelijke debatten en disciplines 
omtrent pornografie, werkomstandigheden van pornografische performers, consent en consent 
binnen de pornografische industrie. Het literatuuronderzoek wordt aangestuurd door een basale 
thematische filmanalyse van Pleasure. Daarnaast wordt het literatuuronderzoek aangesterkt door een 
diepte-interview met Jennifer Lyon Bell, pornograaf bij haar eigen bedrijf Blue Artichoke Films in 
Amsterdam. Uit het onderzoek is naar voren gekomen dat er binnen de wetenschap een sterke zwart-witte 
kijk is op de werkomstandigheden binnen de pornografische industrie. Wetenschappelijke artikelen 
vanuit de sex-critical benadering betogen dat performers enkel geëxploiteerd en misbruikt worden. 
Daarentegen beargumenteren teksten vanuit de sex-positive benadering dat zolang elke keuze 
gebeurt op basis van consent performen in pornografie een positieve invloed kan hebben op de 
performer. Echter, zowel Thyberg als Bell wijzen erop dat de omstandigheden genuanceerder zijn. 
Kijkend naar de debatten omtrent consent is te stellen dat wanneer de omgeving waarin consent 
wordt gegeven juist is, consent een bijdrage levert aan een veiligere werkomgeving op de 
pornografische filmset. Echter, wanneer de omgeving onveilig is kan consent juist schadelijk zijn voor 
de performer. Daarom is het een noodzaak om uitgebreider onderzoek te doen naar de vele 
aftakkingen binnen de pornografische industrie en hun omgang met consent om zo misbruik en 
exploitatie effectief tegen te gaan."
Computational deconvolution of atherosclerotic plaques cell composition and its clinical association,"['Bel Bordes, Gemma']","['Mokry, Michal']",2023-02-04T01:00:43Z,EN,"['Deconvolution, benchmarking, cell composition, carotid plaques, macrophages, sex\ndifferences, atherosclerosis severity.']",Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"Atherosclerotic plaques are highly complex and heterogeneous, with a large number of extracellular
components and cell types involved. Traditional analysis, like histology assessment of the plaques, have
been useful to characterize their vulnerability, leading to a binary risk stratification of patients. However,
there is a need for other analysis to assess the plaque composition at higher resolution. Single-cell (sc)
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies have identified the cell composition of human carotid plaques, but the
costs of this technology forces patient cohorts to be too small for clinical studies. Recently, deconvolution
has been introduced to infer the cell type proportions of samples with bulk RNA-seq data using a cell
type reference derived from the sc RNA-seq data. We aimed to perform deconvolution of human carotid
plaques from a large cohort of patients that underwent endarterectomy, to get their cell type proportions
and associate these with sex (with linear regression) and atherosclerosis severity, including symptoms
(with logistic regression) and future events after surgery (with Cox proportional hazard model). We first
benchmarked different deconvolution procedures regarding the data processing and the method selection.
We detected that reducing the number of cell types from the sc reference improved the deconvolution
performance, but all methods resulted in very different cell abundances. However, proportions from
macrophages and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were consistent among methods and, more importantly, with
plaque histology. We finally observed female plaques to have a tendency to host a greater SMC percentage
(β = 1.86 [-0.25, 3.96], p = 0.084), and macrophages being associated with symptomatic plaques (odds
ratio = 1.02 [1.01, 1.03], p = 0.003) and major cardiovascular events after endarterectomy (hazard ratio
= 1.02 [1.00, 1.03], p = 0.012). Our results suggest that obtaining deconvolved cell proportions of plaques
is not straightforward for all the cell types, but macrophage and SMC proportions were consistent. While
macrophages were did not differ significantly from male to female plaques, the latter showed an increased
SMC content. Macrophages, in turn, might constitute a risk factor for atherosclerosis severity, and more
research on the subtypes that are responsible for this should follow."

The relationship between Thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) recurrence after total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine treatment,"['Latour, Chauncey']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-02-04T00:00:36Z,EN,['Thyroglobulin; Thyroglobulin antibody; Thyroid cancer; recurrence; metastasis; total thyroidectomy; radioactive iodine treatment; papillary; follicular'],Farmacie,"INTRODUCTION: Thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) are present in 10-25% of differentiated thyroid cancer patients (DTC) and can interfere with thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the presence of TgAb and recurrence and/or metastasis in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who received total thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine treatment.
METHODS: In this research we included 143 patients with DTC between the period of 2011-2021, who had undergone a total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine therapy. The patients were stratified by Tg, TgAb (negative of positive) status and recurrence and/or metastasis for the follow. The Chi-squared T-test was used to determine an association between Tg or TgAb and DTC recurrence and/or metastasis and the multivariate analysis to identify risk factors for recurrence and/or metastasis.
RESULTS: The results showed significant differences in characteristics between the observed groups in tumor type (P=0.026), the cumulative dose (P=0.004), the Tg 0months (P<.001) and the number of treatment (P=0.050). The Multivariate analysis showed that the thyroglobulin value before RAI treatment (Tg 0mnd) (P= 0.002; OR: 1.017; CI: 1.006 - 1.029) was the only independent predictor for recurrence and/or metastasis.
CONCLUSION: The odds ratio out the multivariate analysis has shown that there is a 1.7% increased risk of recurrence and/or metastasis in the presence of Tg before the first radioactive treatment after a thyroidectomy. Thus deeming Image-forming techniques combined with serum thyroglobulin measurements the most sensitive methods for detecting recurrence and/or metastasis."
Impaired synaptic signalling involved in fragile X syndrome,"['Kloosterhuis, Kes']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-02-04T01:00:46Z,EN,['Fragile X syndrome; FMRP; Fmr1; synapse; synaptic plasticity; cytoskeleton remodelling'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenetic disorder caused by loss of function of the Fmr1 gene encoding the RNA-binding protein FMRP, which is known to associate with ribosomes and act as a translational regulator. FXS shows a lot of overlapping cellular features with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), including aberrancies in synapse number, morphology and function. This review aims to provide an overview of synaptic signalling pathways involved in FXS in the context of recent findings, and increase the understanding of the interplay of synaptic processes at hand to aid future research and FXS treatment development. Important mechanisms dysregulated in FXS synapses include metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) mediated long-term depression (LTD), which is the focus of the popular mGluR theory of FXS, association and functioning of FMRP-containing translation complexes and competing regulatory complexes including the WAVE complex, various forms of synaptic plasticity involving mGluRs, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABARs) leading to a disturbed excitation-inhibition balance and actin cytoskeleton remodelling. FMRP deficiency leads to exaggerated dendritic synthesis of proteins involved in these processes which underly functional and structural synaptic plasticity, inducing FXS features including an increase in immature thin long spines with a lower postsynaptic density. Current FXS treatment development shows limited results, illustrating the need for a shift towards iPSC-derived models that can account for heterogeneity among patients and improve drug screenings, development of new treatment strategies and fundamental research on synaptic disease mechanisms underlying FXS."

security. As a security actor, the European Union has responded to the exponential rise in threats by
implementing new policies aimed at defending the Union against malicious cyber-attacks. This thesis
evaluates to which extent the European Union can be classified as a collective security actor in the
field of cyber defense. Through a targeted sentiment analysis and a critical discourse analysis, this
thesis proposes that the EU passed through multiple cycles of the collective security framework
between the early 2000s and 2019. As such, the EU published the groundbreaking Cybersecurity Act
in 2013 and the Cyber Defense Policy Framework in 2014. Even though the EU attempted to
implement supranational decision-making, these policies remained at the intergovernmental level. In
2016, a new cycle of the collective security framework commenced, when NATO classified cyber as
the fifth domain of war. Consequently, the NotPetya attack in 2017 disrupted critical infrastructures
all over the world. As a response, the EU revised the Cyber Defense Policy Framework in 2018 and
the Cybersecurity Act in 2019. This thesis concludes that with these documents, the EU was able to
shift decision-making to the supranational level, even though some problems of institutional
fragmentation persist. Therefore, the EU almost classifies as a collective security actor, but should
act on intentions to solve institutional fragmentation."
"Expansion Microscopy: Recent Developments in Gelation, Labeling, and Imaging Strategies","['Elling, Ward']","['Kapitein, L.C.']",2023-02-03T01:01:26Z,EN,[],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Light microscopy is a powerful approach for studying the dynamic spatiotemporal organization of the molecular processes in cellular life. However, the resolution that can be obtained using conventional light microscopy is insufficient to resolve many macromolecular structures. While various super-resolution imaging approaches have been developed that overcome this resolution limit, they require specialized equipment that is largely inaccessible to most scientists. Recently, an alternative method for super-resolution imaging was developed, called expansion microscopy, which bypasses the resolution limit by spatially separating biomolecules through expansion of the sample. Unlike previous super-resolution imaging approaches, expansion microscopy can be performed using commercially available compounds and widely-available conventional microscopes, making super-resolution imaging more accessible for non-expert researchers. In this review, the original expansion microscopy concept and followed by early developments in its workflow will first be described. Next, this review will focus on challenges within the field of expansion microscopy, including labeling density, expansion factor, and expansion isotropy, and critically review recent developments aimed at addressing these challenges. Finally, recently developed alternative labeling strategies for expansion microscopy and the possibility to combine expansion microscopy with other super-resolution microscopy approaches will be discussed."

strategies are only moderately effective. The physiology at heart of AN remains to be deciphered. 
Aberrances in value-based decision making, including cognitive inflexibility and excessive self-control, 
contribute to treatment resistance in AN. Furthermore, the mesolimbic pathway, that plays a 
prominent role in reinforcement behaviors including value-based decision making, seems to function 
aberrantly in AN. Gut microbiota affect neurotransmission, mood and cognitive function via the gut 
microbiota-brain axis and the composition of gut microbiome is altered in AN. Here, we hypothesized
that AN-specific dysbiosis is causally linked to putative changes in flexible value-based decision 
making, behavioral inhibition and ventral tegmental area (VTA) reward signaling during AN 
development. Thirty-nine recipient tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-cre rats, surgically injected with credependent GCaMP8s and implanted with optic fibers above the VTA, were pretreated with 
antibiotics and thereafter reconstituted with the gut microbiota of three patients with restrictingtype AN and three healthy controls. Antibiotics- and microbiota-induced changes in cognitive
flexibility, behavioral inhibition and VTA dopamine (DA) neuronal responses to reward, reinforced 
and non-reinforced lever presses were examined using the probabilistic reversal learning task, 
Go/NoGo task and concomitant fiber photometry. Both antibiotics-induced and AN-specific dysbiosis 
were found to be insufficient to induce changes in reversal learning performance and VTA DA 
neuronal responses to sucrose reward and reward prediction. Furthermore, elevated plus maze and 
open field tests revealed no effect of the intervention on anxiety-related behaviors. Although the 
current findings do not support a role for the anorectic gut microbiome in cognitive inflexibility, 
anxiety and reward signaling, future research is required to elucidate if AN-specific microbiota
contribute to the pathophysiology of AN."
An exploratory study on the role of active sleep in microstructural development of corticospinal tracts in preterm infants.,"['Wojtal, Klaudia']","['Dudink, Jeroen']",2023-02-07T01:00:59Z,EN,[],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Layman's summary.
Infants during pregnancy undergo a lot of changes in their organism, including their brain and specific parts of it. Some infants are born too early with not enough time spent in the protective place that is their mother’s womb. This can result in injury to various parts of the brain, such as the white matter. White matter connections, among other things, carry the main pathway of neurons called the corticospinal tract. This pathway goes from the spine to the top of the brain and is responsible for movement and processing of sensory experience. Those preterm infants often have movement problems that are visible only later in childhood. It is important to find out what we can do to make sure these infants have the best conditions for their brain to carry on with the maturation processes. Sleep is one the things that are much needed for the brain. It takes care of toxins, helps us think better and provides the environment for creating important growth hormones. Preterm infants spend most of their time sleeping and most of it is in active sleep. It is called active because infants move their bodies, have muscle jerks, and can even show facial expressions. This state has been studied in animals and was found to be the source of help with the development of sensory and motor processing. Each movement lets the infant learn about their body; therefore, their brain is being stimulated during sleep. 
We wanted to check how big the role of active sleep is in the development of white matter in preterm infants. White matter can be studied looking at how water behaves in the brain. Different maturation processes affect the freedom with which water molecules can move in the brain. The more developed the brain is, the more directional the movement of water is. 
This work helped us understand more in what direction sleep studies could go. We calculated that we need many more infants to have clear results. Moreover, we found that the number of days the infants spent with respiratory support greatly affected the role of sleep in the maturation of their brains. I hope it can inspire future studied to study what we can do to make sure preterm infants’ sleep is protected in the best way for their brain development."

COVID-19 adviezen zijn gelogd, evenals alle besluitmomenten omtrent COVID-19. Alle 
variabelen zijn gekwantificeerd. Vervolgens zijn er een aantal correlatie toetsen uitgevoerd en 
een betrouwbaarheidsanalyse. De factoren duur en aard bleken een significante invloed te

Size determination and frequency response of a single nanoemulsion droplet,"['Bruggemann, Ingmar']","['Faez, S.']",2023-02-04T01:01:10Z,EN,['emulsie; nano; optica; frequency; grootteverdeling'],Nanomaterials Science,"Understanding properties of small particles, such as their size is important in many applications, for example in diagnostics and imaging methods. Often, the particles are dispersed in another solution, think for example of blood cells in serum. A widespread approach uses fluorescent labelling to visualize these particles, by means of chemically attaching a compound to the original particle. This causes differences in structure and how the particle moves. 

Here, we present a label-free, optical imaging technique, able to detect and characterize single particles in solution. By using microscopy and computational analysis, we image the particles and try to determine their size, down to the single-particle level. In addition, an electric field was applied to a single emulsion particle and its optical response was recorded. 

The size of the prepared nanoemulsion droplets was estimated to be between 100 and 150 nm. The results from the microscope show that the presented optical detection system is capable of detecting very small particles and that our method produces small and stable emulsions. The optical signal obtained from the application of the electric field was converted into a frequency response, using Fourier transformation. The results showed an expected signal at the starting frequency, but also some higher-order modes. These results serve as a first step into investigating single-particle dynamics, using straightforward experimental methods. From this point forward, other particle properties, such as their shape and response to more external perturbations could be investigated."

I use feminist film theory to understand how film has the capacity to change structures of cultural norms and values and analyze how film can affect spectators through phenomenology. The theoretical framework which consists of post humanist, decolonial and ecofeminist theory, informs the decisions made in the ‘practice’ part, in which the film plan is described. Finally, Nature Calling confronts the spectator with the human/non-human binary to eventually illustrate that this binary is a human creation and can therefore be made undone."

This thesis analyzes in what respect Türkiye utilizes its newly acquired drone industry to reach its ‘Neo-Ottoman’ inspired foreign policy goals. The thesis starts off with a description of the foreign policy evolution of the Turkish Republic from its founding in 1923 till the present day. It analyses the drivers behind the country’s move from Kemalism to Neo-Ottomanism and moreover the deteriorating effect this has on Türkiye’s relationship with its traditional allies in the West. This dynamic is connected to Türkiye’s domestic drone industry by stating the country’s growing assertiveness and deteriorating relationship with the West, stimulated Ankara’s motivation to cultivate its domestic drone industry – and autonomize its arms industry as a whole. Türkiye’s drone warfare capabilities allow the country to independently conduct successful military interventions with a relatively favorable ‘risk to reward’ ration. By internationally providing its drone technologies – and concomitant strategies – Ankara is capable of ‘exporting’ military success to the nations it favors.  Hence, Türkiye’s drone industry increases Ankara’s direct and indirect, military and non-military interventionist capabilities. This in turn, stimulates the foreign policy assertive of Türkiye which stems from Ankara’s goal to present itself as a Neo-Ottoman regional power, capable of rivaling major brokers. Hence, from a (neo-)realist perspective, the cultivation of Türkiye’s drone industry can – on the medium to short turn – be seen as a real foreign policy asset. This thesis concludes with a discussion of the possible negative ramifications of Türkiye’s current drone policies on its international standing, thereby adding a more critical note to the success story that is predominantly presented in this thesis."
Reactive oxygen species and their influence on mediating salinity tolerance mecahnisms in Triticum aestivum,"['Echobardo, Nakisa']","['Sasidharan, R.']",2023-02-07T01:01:06Z,EN,"['halophytic plants , reactive oxygen species, wheat']",Bio Inspired Innovation,"Soil salinity has detrimental impact on wheat productivity and since wheat is amongst the most important crops for human consumption, soil salinization imposes a major threat to global food security. Currently 
we know three mechanisms in which plants withstand salinity stress, namely, ion exclusion, tolerance to osmotic stress and tissue tolerance. Although significant research efforts have elucidated the genetic regulations occurring in the exclusion of ions, as well as compartmentalization of ions at the cellular level and thereby enhancing tissue tolerance, it still remains largely unknown which genes mediate osmotic stress tolerance. Osmotic stress causes oxidative damage because of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Plants are capable of removing ROS with antioxidant systems. The mechanisms in which ROS remains in balance across the three salinity tolerance mechanisms in wheat have never been studied yet. In short, there are two gaps in our understanding of salinity tolerance in wheat, namely, the limited amounts of candidate genes discovered that influence salinity tolerance and the lack of understanding on the role of ROS metabolism in mediating the known salinity tolerance mechanisms. In this research, I aim to identify novel gene candidates associated with salinity tolerance through genome-wide association mapping. Subsequently, I aim to identify how ROS metabolism influences salinity tolerance in genes previously identified to be associated with the salinity tolerance mechanisms, as well as possible gene candidates we discover in the GWAS. The outcome of this research will improve our understanding on salinity tolerance and is pivotal for salinity tolerant crop breeding."
Nature based solutions and their success in Climate Tech,"['Echobardo, Nakisa']","['Acevedo Guerrero, Tatiana']",2023-02-07T01:01:04Z,EN,"['Nature-based solutions, climate change, negative emissions technologies, CO2 removal']",Bio Inspired Innovation,"Since the start of the industrial revolution, anthropogenic activities have increased the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, leading to catastrophic changes to Earth’s ecosystem and human lives. In order to stop further climatic damage, humans need to drastically stop emitting CO2 into the atmosphere by decarbonizing all industries. Decarbonization however is not enough to keep the Earth’s temperature below 1.5°C and we additionally also need negative emissions technologies to store carbon for millennials. The scale of changing conventional, heavy emitting technologies across all sectors is massive and needs rapid and cost-effective deployment. To ensure that the next generation of technological innovations are going to be truly carbon free and don’t have overlooked negative effects to our climate, we need better models to draw inspiration from. In this report, I propose that nature as a model for new technologies is an effective tool for negative emissions technologies. Next to that, we explore the impact venture capital has on the deployment of new technologies within the climate deep-tech space. Ultimately, this report is a setting ground for how we need to perceive the next wave of technologies aimed at decarbonizing all industrial sectors."
Point Line Segment Cover,"['Koimans, Roland']","['Bodlaender, Hans']",2023-02-04T01:00:53Z,EN,"['Point Line Segment Cover, Fixed Parameter Tractability, FPT, Kernel']",Computing Science,"In this thesis, we consider the Point Line Segment Cover problem in a parameterized setting. In this problem, we have to decide for a given set of points in the plane, and an integer k, whether all points can be covered by at most k disjoint non-intersecting line segments. This problem is a more constrained version of the well studied Point Line Cover problem. We introduce new concepts, such as Reserved Line Segments and Hybrid Points, which are used to prove that the Point Line Segment Cover is kernelizable, with a kernel size of O(k^6). This also implies that the Point Line Segment Cover problem is Fixed Parameter Tractable. In this thesis, we also give an algorithm that solves the kernelized instance. The theory has been implemented and experimented with, and through solving various instances it is shown that the kernelization step can significantly decrease the solving time for small values of k."
Developing a human organ-on-a-chip system to investigate and measure the effect of microgravity and radiation in space with a focus on NASH development,"['Caro Torregrosa, Manuel']","['Spee, B.']",2023-02-09T01:00:56Z,EN,['Radiation; microgravity; NASH; MPS; fibrosis'],Regenerative Medicine and Technology,"Since humanity made history in 1969 when Neil Amstrong and his crew first set foot on the Moon, most space missions have focused on bringing astronauts to low Earth’s orbit (LEO). It is only now, in the middle of 2022, that we have sent the Artemis I mission to the moon, with the goal of bringing astronauts on board the Artemis III two years from now. In this context, companies like SpaceX have been making the front pages with their announcements of soon-to-be space missions for Mars exploration and colonization. Earth’s atmosphere provides us with protection from high intensity radiation originated in the Sun, but astronauts lack this protection in LEO or beyond. Furthermore, all species on Earth’s surface have evolved in a specific set of conditions. Earth has a gravitational effect that pulls us towards its center, with a force that we measure as 1G (one earth gravity). If humanity aims to further expand in the universe, it is of utmost importance to study the effect that space stressors such as radiation and microgravity will have on human biology. Traditionally, research has been performed taking astronauts as subjects, but the sample size is low and procedures such as biopsies are invasive in nature. Alternatively, rodents have been used as models, but their biological differences to humans impedes the faithful extrapolation of results. Recently, a new technology called “organ-on-a-chip” has been developed. These chips are not electronic chips but are made of glass or other material not toxic to cells that has microscopic channels carved inside them. In these channels, researchers can introduce cells from a specific organ. This chip, with the cells from an organ –for example the liver—can be used to study the response of that organ to certain drugs or stimuli, since it is expected to react on a similar way as the real organ would. When the chip can reliably mimic the behaviour of an organ, we call it a valid “model” of that organ. We propose to send one of these models of a liver to the International Space Station (ISS), where it will be exposed to space stressors, and then bring it back to Earth, where it will be compared to a model that stayed on ground. In this comparison, we will measure the accumulation of fat, formation of scar tissue and inflammation, which are common symptoms of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). On Earth, this disease is normally related to diet, diabetes, or genetic factors, but it has been suggested that it could happen in space just by exposure to radiation or microgravity. The results that we obtain from this research will open a door to send more models of liver or other organs to space and study the development of different diseases, and potentially find drugs that prevent or attenuate them. This way, we would ensure that the future humans that travel across the universe are protected and can safely reach their destination."
The selection of functional values and practices in industry-funded nutrition science,"['Hobma, Marcel']","['Nieves-Delgado, A']",2023-02-08T01:01:00Z,EN,"['cultural selection; selection; values in science; philosophy; agency; philosophy of biology; cultural evolution, structural functionalism; Robert Merton; nutrition science; nutrition research; bias; dairy science;']",History and Philosophy of Science,"Industry-funded research in nutrition science tends to generate knowledge that is beneficial to the funder. This effect is known to distort our knowledge of nutrition, and consequently undermine public health policy and the public trust in science. Scholars who study the phenomenon explain it either as an effect of intentional manipulation by food companies and biased researchers, or as the result of an unconscious bias that researchers hold towards their sponsors. In this thesis, I want to investigate an additional mechanism that can explain this phenomenon: the effect of selection on the values and practices in nutrition science. When food companies fund research, they selectively pick researchers who hold pro-industry values and beliefs or use value-embedded concepts and methods that help them produce studies with beneficial outcomes. Modern university departments recruit and promote new nutrition researchers based on their publication record and their capacity to generate external funding, and therefore indirectly select for researchers who possess pro-industry values and practices. These researchers gain in academic prestige, and then teach their values and practices to new generations of researchers, consequently shifting the research culture of the nutrition science community.

To study the possibility and scope of this selection mechanism, I have develop a method based on functionalist sociology and cultural evolution. Robert Merton's structuralist functionalism can offer the methods and theoretical tools to uncover the latent functions of the values and practices in the nutrition science community. The theory of cultural selection can then support Merton’s structuralist worldview and provide a framework for empirical research on how selection has shaped the functional values and practices in nutrition science. I have integrated these two fields into a new framework – called structural selectionism – and applied it to the case of Dutch dairy science. By doing so, I demonstrate the benefits of structural selectionism as a methodology, and show that selection can explain why current day nutrition science serves the industry’s interests instead of the public interest. Since selection is indeed a relevant factor, a reform of the incentive structure of science is necessary to preserve the public interest in nutrition science."
Effectiveness of household processes in the reduction of pesticide residue concentrations on fruit and vegetables,"['Pekel, Floris']","['Huss, Anke']",2023-02-09T01:00:59Z,EN,['Pesticides; processing factors; household processes'],Toxicology and Environmental Health,"Widespread use of pesticides on food products and the associated risks of exposure through dietary intake require the need for precise quantitative risk assessments. Household processing of food products affect the pesticide residue concentration and plays an important role in the accurately estimating if concentrations exceed legislative limits. The mean or median reduction of such processes is expressed as processing factor (PF) and is unique for each combination of pesticide, process and type of product (PPP). Currently, many PFs for household processes are unknown and a clear overview in literature is lacking. Therefore, this study performed a systematic review on literature that researched the reduction effectiveness of specific household processes (boiling, blanching, washing, soaking, peeling) on widely used pesticides (Azoxystrobin, Boscalid, Carbendazim, Chlorpyrifos, Cypermethrin, Cyprodinil, Difenoconazole, Fenhexamid, Fludioxonil, Imidacloprid, Iprodione, Pyraclostrobin, Pyrimethanil, Tebuconazole, Thiacloprid) present in popular fruits and vegetables between 2011 and 2022. In total 28 out of 121 articles were included and their data extracted. High variation was found in effectiveness of PPPs with studies showing contradicting results which is possibly a result of differences in experimental set-up. In general the included studies revealed that peeling, boiling and blanching were more effective in reducing pesticide concentration. Washing and soaking showed high variability in effectiveness with indications that washing with acetic-/citric acid or sodium carbonate solvents were more effective than tap water, however this was highly dependent on the physiochemical properties of the pesticide. This review provides an overview of currently known literature on household processing factors and discusses important determinants of PF. Moreover, it discusses important challenges and factors that are present in this field of research. By doing so, this research aims to contribute to the field of pesticide risk assessments and increase the public health."
Recruitment of microbial communities involved in the soil borne legacy of disease,"['Tarrant, Tilda']","['Berendsen, R.L.']",2023-02-08T01:00:53Z,EN,['Soil-borne legacy of disease; recruitment; Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Hpa-associated microbiome; camalexins; flavonoids'],Environmental Biology,"Plants host an immense and diverse community of microbes, throughout their leaves to the roots and into the surrounding soil. These complex communities provide many benefits to their hosts in exchange for nutrient. For example, plants can actively recruit beneficial microbiomes through the secretion of exudates upon pathogen challenge, resulting in reduced susceptibility to disease. This heightened resistance to a pathogen can be inherited via the soil to future populations of plants as a soil-borne legacy of disease (SBL). Here, we use 16S amplicon sequencing to investigate the spatial and temporal colonisation patterns of a set of consistently recruited Hpa-associated microbes that we suspect play a role the establishment of an SBL in Arabidopsis thaliana. We provide evidence that this Hpa-associated microbiome (HAM) can colonise both the phyllosphere and endosphere of the plant, and furthermore, that they can be inherited in these compartments to a subsequent population of A. thaliana growing on the same soil. These findings support the hypothesis that these beneficial microbes migrate within the plant, explaining how they travel from the phyllosphere to the soil to mediate soil-borne inheritance. In a parallel line of questioning, we investigate the role of plant exudates in the establishment of the SBL. Using A. thaliana mutant genotypes impaired in the secretion of specific metabolites, we implicate two new exudate biosynthesis pathways in this phenomenon – camalexins and flavonoids. This brings us closer to understanding the complex network of interactions required for Hpa-induced recruitment of the protective microbiome and the maintenance of this defensive community for subsequent populations. Together, our results contribute to an emerging model of how active plant-microbe interactions foster beneficial microbiomes that protect against disease, a better understanding of which will unlock further research avenues and facilitate advances in crop protection techniques for sustainable agriculture."
Technological Innovation System Analysis of the Dutch cutter fishery regarding fishing techniques,"['Hillenius, Thimo']","['Krijgsheld, Pauline']",2023-02-09T01:01:03Z,EN,"['Technological Innovation System Analysis, Dutch cutter fishery, fishing techniques']",Bio Inspired Innovation,"This literature review comprises a technological innovation system analysis of the innovation system surrounding fishing techniques in the Dutch cutter fishery. The sector is in need of support, as currently the business case for landing fish turns out negatively, while innovations are needed that offer perspective for the future. In general, the method of Hekkert. et al is followed, adjusted for use in a literature review of limited size (M. P. Hekkert et al., 2007).
An innovation system consists of a structure, that fulfills system functions to varying degrees. For the part of the innovation system that is in the (pre)-development phase, guidance of the search, mobilization of resources, and resistance in the sector are hampering the innovation trajectory. For the system that handles mature technologies, it is the continuity of current technologies and mobilization of resources due to the high fuel costs that hamper entrepreneurial activities.
Improvements in the system are to i) offer perspective to the cutter fishery sector, ii) enable entrepreneurial activities in innovation, iii) stimulate the market for sustainable fish, iv) focus on multidisciplinary research for future fisheries, v) enhance international cooperation, and vi) stimulate knowledge development and sharing. An essential factor is that fishers that want to innovate are financially supported to stay in business during this trajectory. Theoretically, this literature research further develops an understanding of the workings of innovation systems by applying the method of innovation system analysis to a traditional sector. Practically, it offers handles to intervene in the current innovation system around fishing techniques in the Dutch cutter fishery, which may help them find a grip in the current crisis."

Changes in their distributions affect higher levels in the food web, such as fish and coastal birds, and can also can serve as indicators for shifts in boundary conditions of the system. It is therefore essential to regularly monitor macrozoobenthic distributions. Field sampling is a labor-intensive and time-consuming method and is therefore not suitable for frequent monitoring. Remote-sensing methods are also challenging due to the homogeneous spectral signatures of intertidal areas. The present study proposes a novel method to predict the seasonal distribution of macrozoobenthic species presence, biomass and abundance, based on feature extraction from a variational autoencoder (VAE) model. Seasonal field observations were gathered in September 2021, April 2022 and July 2022 and the data was used to test the prediction models’ performances."
Dependence of Aspergillus niger on secretions of neighbouring colonies.,"['Romano Olmedo, Paco']","['Wosten, Han']",2023-02-08T01:01:10Z,EN,['Aspergillus niger; heterogeneity; CRISPR/Cas9; glucoamylase'],Environmental Biology,"Heterogeneity can be observed at many different levels in the ascomycete Aspergillus niger. This study mainly focusses on the heterogeneity in the secretion of glucoamylase. To this end, a CRISPR-Cas9 approach was used to create knockout strains for the genes glaA or amyR in a strain that constitutively expresses GFP. Inactivation of either glaA or amyR resulted in abolished growth on starch. Growth was restored when co-culturing either strain with a wildtype. This was studied in more detail by varying the ratio between wild-type and knockout spores in the inoculum. Results showed that the mutant exhibited a growth deficiency when its spores were more abundant in the inoculum. Inoculating a relatively low amount of mutant spores when compared to the wildtype fully restored growth. These data show that A. niger is able to profit from the secretions of neighbouring colonies. Besides this, the growth differences when testing the different ratios indicate that there is an optimal ratio between productive and non-productive hyphae in the co-culture, and perhaps also within one single colony."
Review of Bioinspired Innovations and the Potential Sustainability Contributions,"['Chao, Janet']","['Appelman, Jaco']",2023-02-08T01:00:56Z,EN,"[""bioinspired innovation; biologically inspired design (BID); Life's Principles; Sustainability""]",Bio Inspired Innovation,"In recent decades, innovations inspired by nature have received much attention as biological knowledge can boost the development of sustainable and innovative design. Due to global warming, the need for an immediate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions has been highlighted. Bioinspired innovations are thought to bring sustainability impacts to human society. However, mimicking biological models does not always lead to desirable outcomes. Integrating nature patterns into the design is essential for making a contribution to sustainability, which is mainly determined by practitioners in the design phase. In this study, we perform a literature review of current bioinspired innovations with a particular focus on the potential sustainability contributions proposed by the practitioners. Four interesting bioinspired cases are demonstrated: (1) lotus-inspired façade paint, (2) camel-inspired cooling system, (3) sponge-inspired mechanically robust lattice, and (4) squid-inspired thermoregulatory material. These examples are evaluated with Life’s Principles to get to know whether the nature sustainability patterns are integrated. Our findings indicate that the four cases have several features in common regarding the potential sustainability contributions. All of four designs are resource efficient and able to adapt to changing conditions. We assume that the similarity between the four cases is due to the attention of the practitioners. The function and efficiency of the innovations may be commonly emphasized, and thus results in some sustainability contributions. However, regarding the sustainability of the innovations, many other aspects need to be assessed. The sustainability of the materials was not considered by the practitioners yet. The innovations, therefore, are not considered to be fully sustainable. We suggest that the evaluation of the synthesis and recycling processes of the materials can be an effective and feasible step in future work."
Hurdles to be crossed in the use of computed tomography in post-mortem inspection of chickens,"['Dasari, nithya']","['Lipman, Len']",2023-02-11T01:00:53Z,EN,[],One Health,"Chicken meat is the most consumed meat in the EU and worldwide. As production increases, more effective processing methods and equipment, combined with advanced inspections, are needed to ensure safety. As the speed of the processing line increases to meet demand, more mistakes are made by the evisceration machine as it does not take into account the size of the bird during evisceration. This leads to leakage of gut contents and environmental contamination. This project aims to reduce the source of contamination at the slaughterhouse and thereby reduce the overall contamination. This can be achieved in the future by adapting the machine to the individual size of the birds by introducing a computer tomography (CT) into the processing. Another aspect that requires attention is post-mortem inspection. Since it is challenging to inspect each chicken moving at a high belt speed, CT is again an experimental tool to inspect the chickens in the slaughterhouse.
The current practical investigated the frequency of visible contamination due to incorrect evisceration and its relationship to the concentration of bacteria in carcass rinse samples after evisceration. In addition, the variation of bacterial concentrations in the herd and the correlation between Campylobacter and Enterobacteriaceae were investigated. Finally, abnormal and normal chicken carcasses were scanned using the CT scanning machine to identify various abnormalities. As part of this practical, an attempt was also made to measure the size of the chickens. Results showed no statistically significant differences in bacterial counts between time points after evisceration, and a weak correlation was found between Campylobacter and Enterobacteriaceae. Linear regression was used to test whether visible contamination could predict the intensity of bacterial concentrations. The model used is weak but significant in the case of Enterobacteriaceae and could not prove this in the case of Campylobacter. At the same time, chicken carcasses from the slaughterhouse were scanned. No significant differences were found between abnormal and normal chicken carcasses; however, the size of the chickens could be measured from the CT scans. This study indicates that visible contamination should be controlled to reduce bacterial concentration. Even though the CT scans could not identify the abnormalities, they could still be used to measure size and possibly be used to adjust the evisceration machine in the future. Combining imaging techniques with optical technologies such as camera vision would be more interesting to achieve optimal results in identifying abnormalities."
The Energiewende: Developing Scenarios for a Carbon-Neutral Industry in Germany,"['Kelnreiter, Nikolaus']","['Eichhammer, Wolfgang']",2023-02-12T01:00:54Z,EN,['scenarios; scenario development; Germany; industry; climate neutrality; cross-impact balance; CIB'],Energy Science,"Scenario planning provides stakeholders with a tool to understand the future. Through the depiction of different possible futures, it informs decision-making and challenges how we think about future developments. In Germany, a series of studies modeled various pathways to climate neutrality by 2045/50. Although giving valuable insights, they fall short of explaining how they arrived at the scenarios they modeled.

This thesis aims to address this gap. It focuses on the decarbonization of the industry, which is one of the key challenges on the path to achieve climate neutrality by 2045, as targeted by the German government. It does so by applying a systems approach, which aims to explain other developments that are linked to industry as well. In addition to techno-economic factors, qualitative developments such as societal trends, corporate strategies, the political framework, and others are also taken into account. To achieve this, the thesis utilizes a cross-impact balancing (CIB) technique. CIB allows for the construction of consistent scenarios by creating a matrix of interactions between different developments. Through a structured expert elicitation, these interactions are assessed one by one on whether they promote or restrict each other. For the expert elicitation, essays portray the possible course that each of the individual developments considered could take. Then, the matrix is analyzed with software. That way, sixteen scenarios are developed, which are consistent within the CIB framework. Four of these are described in more detail through storylines: one scenario where developments occur late and decarbonization seems at risk, one where PtX is the dominant energy carrier, one where a quick scale-up of technologies makes decarbonization possible, and one where societal change and the establishment of a circular economy leads to a reduction in demand. Furthermore, the impact of the different developments upon each other is assessed.

Because of how the method is constructed, a few uncertainties regarding the scenarios arise, e.g., about the combination of some developments in the scenarios. Still, the structured approach offers advantages over the usual, less systematic scenario planning techniques."
The Ugliness of the Beautiful Game: How can Supporters Morally Enjoy Football in the Modern Era?,"['Spiegelman, David']","['Rijnders, Jeroen']",2023-02-10T01:01:11Z,EN,['Sportswashing; moral permissibility; ethics'],Applied Ethics,"In this essay, I will address the issue of sportswashing, from the perspective of supporters who wish to maintain an ethical relationship with football, even in cases where the football in question has become directly involved with sportswashers. More specifically, my research question asks: in cases where a sportswasher has become directly involved in the football, in what ways (if any) would it be morally permissible for football fans to continue partaking in the joys of football?

Sportswashing is a process that occurs when an agent strategically uses their involvement in sport - usually by means of hosting a sporting event or owning a club - to cleanse a morally tainted reputation and change the public perception, rather than addressing the moral problems that gave them such a reputation (Fruh et al., 2022). Although the severest moral wrongdoings are usually the background injustices that the sportswasher is hoping to distract away from, to minimize, or to normalize, I focus on the specific wrongs of sportswashing: that it corrupts footballing institutions, communities, and identities, and threatens to make participants complicit in the sportswasher's moral wrongdoings.

I argue that supporters who see themselves as moral supporters can simultaneously participate in the typical activities of fandom, without being deemed complicit in the background injustices of the sportswasher. However, to be able to say that a supporter is participating ethically in the football in cases directly linked to sportswashing, there are certain conditions that must be met. If the conditions are satisfied, we can reasonably say that the supporter is engaged in fandom critically and has renovated her participation with football in a way that is morally permissible."

To do this, I center and deeply engage with the narratives and reflections gathered through interviewing former members of the feminist movement Non Una Di Meno. Non Una Di Meno is an Italian and transnational feminist organization established in 2016 in Rome and currently has multiple chapters across the nation. It was inspired by the Argentinian movement Ni Una Menos which was founded in 2015 as a response to overwhelming cases of femicide and gender-based violence. Activists, advocates, and militants are to me some of the most fascinating and inspiring subjects as they continuously try to embody what is yet unexisting. The encounters with these feminist activists have shed light on the critical status of today’s political militancy and organizing in Italy, its challenges and pitfalls, and the need for stronger and more intimate interpersonal connections and practices of care and solidarity that would reflect in practice the type of social relations integral to the society that they are fighting to contrive.
Moreover, they provided insight into the mundane and personal dimensions of feminist becoming and resistance, how their identity as feminist militants has shaped and changed their lives and their perceptions of the world, as well as their expectations for the envisioning and adaptation of the feminist principles and objectives in daily life. To expand on the activists’ understandings and reflections, this project will engage with pertinent scholarly contributions which will primarily focus on the becoming of the feminist political subject, the connections between militancy and relationality, and worldmaking through care and community building. This entwining between personal reflection and theory is meant to capture the material and ethereal composition of feminist living and thinking and contribute to envisioning new and radical ways of relating and strengthening coalitions in feminist spaces and beyond."
Unravelling the function of circRmst in the development of midbrain dopaminergic neurons,"['Michels, Lars']","['Pasterkamp, Jeroen']",2023-02-11T00:00:40Z,EN,[],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecules which are formed
by an alternative splicing mechanism called backsplicing. Due to recent improvements in RNA
sequencing techniques, circRNAs have been discovered to be widely expressed in a tissue-specific
and cell type-specific manner and expression patterns differ throughout embryonic development.
Because of the relatively high expression of circRNAs in the developing brain, combined with the fact
that many other types of ncRNA play a role in brain development, it is interesting to study the role of
circRNAs in this process. Previously in this project, multiple circRNAs specific to midbrain
dopaminergic (mDA) neurons in the ventral midbrain (vMB) were found. Among them circular
rhabdomyosarcoma 2-associated transcript (circRmst) was particularly highly expressed in mDA
neurons. circRmst also had a change in expression during development. Therefore, the main aim was
to discover the function of circRmst in the development of mDA neurons. Using lentivirus-delivered
short hairpin RNAs (shRNA), circRmst was knocked down in embryonic vMB primary cultures, which
caused an increase in soma size and complexity, and a decreased amount of mDA neurons. In vivo
knockdown of circRmst, induced using in utero electroporation (IUE), led to altered position of mDA
neurons. A function of circRmst is proposed in which circRmst could regulate size and migration of
mDA neurons by altering the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, circRmst could be involved in mDA neuron
differentiation or survivability. This study provides the first evidence that circRmst plays a role in
mDA neuron development."
Internal validity of a text mining algorithm to identify Adverse Drug Reactions in freetext entries from electronic health records of geriatrics and orthopedics patients,"['Dijck, Loes van']","['Egberts, A.C.G.']",2023-02-10T01:01:13Z,EN,['Adverse Drug Reaction; Electronic Health Record; text mining; natural language processing'],Farmacie,"Background: Structured registration of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the electronic health record 
(EHR) is vital in preventing recurrence of ADRs, but in practice, ADRs are often saved as free-text 
only. Using a text mining tool could be useful in identifying these ADRs.
Aim: To determine the internal validity of a previously developed ADR-identifying text mining 
algorithm at the geriatrics and orthopedics department at Catharina Hospital Eindhoven.
Methods: One year of EHR data from 15 orthopedics patients and 6 geriatrics patients were manually 
reviewed for ADRs, creating a gold standard. MedDRA and SNOMED-CT terminology was used to 
identify symptoms and the Dutch G-standard database was used to identify offending medications. 
The same data was reviewed by the algorithm and its output was compared to the gold standard.
Results: A total of 100 unique ADRs were identified in the gold standard, 20 of which were 
potentially serious. 14 ADRs were also found by the algorithm (true positives); 86 ADRs were marked 
as false negatives. The algorithm also returned 49 false positives. Overall, the algorithm reached a 
22% PPV (positive predictive value), 14% sensitivity and an F-measure of 0.17. At the geriatrics 
department the PPV was 28%, as opposed to 15% at the orthopedics department. For serious ADRs, 
the algorithm reached an overall sensitivity of 20%.
Conclusion: In this preliminary analysis, the algorithm did not meet our goals. This study needs to be 
finished in order to draw valid conclusions. Future research into this algorithm is required for further 
improvements and evaluation of its performance in different settings."

However, mechanisms and pathways in-volved remain elusive. Accumulating evidence suggests that bacterial metabolites might greatly impact the immune regulation of the intestine. Butyrate, a short chain fatty ac-ids (SCFA), which is metabolized by the gut bacteria from otherwise indigestible fibre-rich diets, has been shown to ameliorate IBD symptoms. Although the exact mechanisms remain partly understood, it is known that a major drop in butyrate-producing bacteria is associated with the increased pro-inflammatory environment. The increased amount of inflammatory cues facilitate macrophages to differentiate into a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Hence, enhancing butyrate levels in therapy could be a potential treatment for IBD. This review summarised the current knowledge on how butyrate affects intesti-nal macrophages, in terms of recruitment and phenotype polarization. With the inci-dence of IBD outpacing death and global gains in life expectancy, newly diagnosed IBD patients' cases are being added to the pool of prevalent individuals on a continuous ba-sis. Therefore, broadening our knowledge about different pathways is essential for indi-vidualized treatment planning and improving the quality of life of IBD patients."

Therefore, trains can have multiple moments at different times and locations where they are stationary and a mechanic is allowed to work on them. As some tasks require certain skills, there are restrictions on which mechanics can do which tasks. Some of these tasks require two mechanics to work on at the same time, and therefore the time when these mechanics start working on this job has to be synchronized.
At the moment, scheduling is done ad hoc by the mechanics at the start of their shifts. The manual planning takes time out of a possibly busy schedule while not always resulting in a desirable, robust solution. Therefore, in this thesis, we propose a local search approach for scheduling mechanics on a shunting yard subject to these constraints.  We aim to create robust schedules for the mechanics which can be generated before their shifts start and are easy to update if a disruption in the shunting plan were to occur. Our method is able to generate good results on a variety of realistic problem instances."

Because it was a necessary evil, prostitution had to be controlled, and it was thus regulated by the State. This regulation entailed that sex workers were supposed to be regularly medically checked for venereal diseases. However, from Christian spheres, State regulation of prostitution was increasingly seen as a way of stimulating this public sin. Prostitution got linked to slavery and needed to be abolished. The movement against the regulation of prostitution was a Christian movement that originated from the orthodox-Christian Réveil movement that came up in Europe around the middle of the nineteenth century. The principles of the Réveil were that good Christians were supposed to help out others. Thus they also wanted to help out sex workers. The British abolitionist Butler inspired the preacher Pierson to fight the regulation of prostitution and to start an organisation called the DAP, the first organisation in the Netherlands against the regulation of prostitution. A few years later, Butler also inspired the aristocratic Klerck-van Hogendorp to start a female organisation against the regulation of prostitution, called the Women’s Union. Both these organisations were at the core of the fight against the regulation of prostitution. They both originated from an orthodox-Christian principle, and they both used political tactics in a way of changing the State regulation of prostitution. However, their differences influence the way they operated and can thus explain why they were two different organisations within the same movement. They both used their own ways of influencing public opinion, gaining more members and trying to achieve their common goal of fighting the State regulation of prostitution. But they also collaborated, for example by organising a congress or by handing in a petition to the government with requirements that set the basis for the eventual Law change. In 1911, they got what they campaigned for: the Dutch Bill of Morality got implemented in the Netherlands. Brothels and female trafficking were implemented in Dutch Criminal law. The work of the movement against the regulation of prostitution had paid off.""]"
Digitale transformatie van sportbonden,"['Essen, Romee van']","['Bottenburg, Maarten van']",2023-07-13T00:00:56Z,NL,['Digitaal sportaanbod; digitale transformatie; institutionele theorie; organisatorische kenmerken;'],Sportbeleid en sportmanagement,"In dit onderzoek is gekeken naar de opkomst van commerciële sportplatformen, specifiek Strava, in de sportsector. Het onderzoek heeft zich gericht op de vraag hoe sportbonden zich kunnen aanpassen aan deze digitale ontwikkelingen en relevant kunnen blijven. Er is gekeken naar de reacties van sportbonden op de druk van maatschappelijke opvattingen en concurrentieverhouding van digitale platforms zoals Strava om digitaal sportaanbod te realiseren. Daarnaast is onderzocht welke organisatorische kenmerken ten grondslag liggen aan de besluitvorming van sportbonden. Het onderzoek richtte zich op de Koninklijke Nederlandse Schaatsbond (KNSB), de Koninklijke Nederlandse Wielren Unie (KNWU) en de Atletiekunie als casestudies om verschillende reacties van sportbonden te verklaren.

Daarmee is gepoogd antwoord te geven op de onderzoeksvraag: “Hoe reageren de KNSB, KNWU en Atletiekunie op de ervaren druk van de toenemende concurrentie van vernieuwende digitale organisatievormen van sportbeoefening die een vergelijkbare doelgroep bedienen, zoals Strava, en maatschappelijke opvattingen om digitaal sportaanbod te ontwikkelen en hoe zijn de verschillen tussen deze bonden te verklaren?”

Dit onderzoek heeft een holistisch beeld verkregen van de (digitale) organisatieontwikkeling en de organisatorische kenmerken die daarbij een rol spelen. Het betrof dertien semigestructureerde interviews met zorgvuldig geselecteerde respondenten, zowel intern als extern. De respondenten gaven inzicht in de externe druk om te digitaliseren en hoe deze druk zich verhoudt tot de interne perceptie. Bovendien zijn verschillende categorieën van bondsmedewerkers en externe respondenten betrokken, inclusief NOC*NSF, om een breder perspectief te verkrijgen. Deze verschillende perspectieven hebben geholpen bij het begrijpen van de uitdagingen en kansen waarmee sportbonden worden geconfronteerd in de ontwikkeling van digitaal sportaanbod. 

Geconcludeerd kan worden dat de KNSB, KNWU en Atletiekunie enige druk ervaren om te anticiperen op digitalisering en het ontwikkelen van digitaal sportaanbod. Met name in reactie op de functionele overlappingen met platforms zoals Strava, ervaren ze concurrentie om met hun aanbod unieke waarde toe te voegen aan de samenleving. Daarnaast ervaren sportbonden druk vanuit de samenleving, gestimuleerd door subsidies van NOC*NSF, om innovatie in de sportsector te bevorderen en een breder publiek te bereiken. De reactie van sportbonden op de druk om digitaal sportaanbod te ontwikkelen wordt beïnvloed door de organisatorische kenmerken, waaronder het besef van relevantie, diversiteit aan visies, financiële rendabiliteit en een ondernemende houding. Deze aspecten spelen een cruciale rol bij het bepalen van de strategieën en benaderingen van sportbonden om succesvol te reageren op de uitdagingen en mogelijkheden van digitalisering.

Dit onderzoek heeft geleid tot aanbevelingen voor sportbonden met betrekking tot de ontwikkeling van digitaal sportaanbod. Om hiermee de brede sector te bereiken en waarde te creëren, is het essentieel dat sportbonden de volgende aanbevelingen in acht nemen: erken de relevantie van de sportbond voor de samenleving en integreer verschillende organisatievormen van sportaanbod, rekening houdend met de complexiteit van diverse visies binnen de bond; communiceer duidelijk over de unieke waarde van digitaal sportaanbod en wees realistisch over capaciteit en financiën; neem een ondernemende houding aan bij het omarmen van digitaal sportaanbod.

Verder onderzoek wordt aanbevolen om een uitgebreidere lijst van organisatorische kenmerken te identificeren die van belang zijn bij een digitale transformatie van sportbonden.

Feeding the Loop. Exploring Human-Technology-Relations through an Autopoietic Understanding of Hybrid Intentionality.,"['Adriaanse, Marit']","['Groot Nibbelink, Liesbeth']",2023-07-13T00:00:52Z,EN,['hybrid intentionality; autopoietic hybrid intentionality; human-technology relations; humanrobot-interaction; artificial intelligence; prescriptions; interactivity; autopoiesis; performativity; interactive\ninstallations; robot art'],"Contemporary Theatre, Dance and Dramaturgy","Abstract

This thesis demonstrates how interactive performance installations that make use of artificial intelligence
function as an autopoietic hybrid intentional feedback-loop. The term hybrid intentionality was coined by
post-phenomenological philosopher of technology Peter-Paul Verbeek and implies the inherently
relational way in which humans are being directed in their experiences, choices and actions by
technology, while this ‘technological intentionality’ cannot exist without human action.

In this thesis, I add to Verbeek’s notion of the concept by arguing for a revised version in relation to
recent developments concerning the relationship between humans and technology due to the rise of
artificial intelligence, since this causes a continuous relational aspect to hybrid intentional relationships
between humans and technology, which Verbeek has not yet mentioned. I do this through employing a
concept based analysis of the case studies Jan by Dutch artist Bram Ellens and Forced Labor: Arena/Simple
Machines by Flemish Choreographer Ugo Dehaes, both interactive performance installations that employ
artificial intelligence, following the approach by cultural theorist Mieke Bal. Bal argues for allowing
concepts to ‘travel’ between disciplines since this offers the concepts a way of reclaiming new meanings
within a new context. Furthermore she considers case studies such as performances to be ‘thinking
objects’ that respond to the concepts applied to them and further unfold their meaning.

I will first explore the concept of hybrid intentionality in relation to the case studies. Building on
perspectives from post-phenomenological philosopher of technology Don Ihde on human-technology
relations and sociologist Bruno Latour on the concept of prescriptions, I explain how the AI systems
employed in these interactive installations create frame-works of possible choices and actions that direct
the participants’ intentionality. However, I also explain why the continuous relationality between the
participant and the AI system asks for a new understanding of the concept of hybrid intentionality.
Drawing on debates around interactivity, autopoiesis and performativity stemming from the fields of
performance studies and robotic and relating to the work of Stroud Cornock and Ernest Edmonds, Oliver
Bown, Petra Gemeinboeck and Rob Saunders, Jennifer Hall and Erika Fischer-Lichte, this thesis tries to
reformulate a new, autopoietic understanding of the concept of hybrid intentionality. Moreover, it argues
for the dramaturgical potency of this concept to invite critical reflection in participants on humantechnology relationships."
Polar Opposites: Opinions on Gender Equality in the Dutch Political Landscape,"['Koornneef, Emma']","['Koster, Noël']",2023-07-13T00:01:04Z,EN,['Political polarization; gender inequality; feedback dynamics; gender equality; public opinion; political attitudes; gender politics; political discourse; gender attitudes; multiparty systems; political change'],Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems,"Despite political effort, gender inequalities decrease at a slow pace in the Netherlands. Scholars state that political polarization is the cause of this disappointing decline. Contrary to twoparty contexts, multiparty contexts like the Netherlands are underresearched in light of political polarization. It is important to understand how political polarization affects opinions on gender equality in multiparty context in order to reduce gender inequalities at a faster pace. Gender Ideology Theory and the Political Polarization Framework were used to understand how political polarization affects the opinions on gender equality on both the public- and institutional level, and to support the expectation that feedback dynamics strengthen these effects. The relationship between public- and institutional polarization and the opinions on gender equality was measured using the European Social Survey and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey Europe. Multiple regression techniques were utilized to understand the relationship between political polarization and opinions on gender equality on both levels, and how these relationships are strengthened by feedback dynamics. Political polarization affects opinions on gender equality in both the public- and institutional sphere. The extreme identification with right-wing ideology causes more negative opinions on gender equality, whereas the extreme identification with left-wing ideology causes more positive opinions on gender equality. Feedback dynamics did not moderate the relationship on the public- nor institutional level. Higher levels of political polarization might hinder progress towards gender equality in the Netherlands. The decline in gender inequalities in the Netherlands can be fastened by depolarization measures on both the public- and institutional levels of society. Public dialogue initiatives and civic education programs are recommended to depolarize the public sphere. Policy measures and diverse representation are recommended to depolarize the institutional sphere."
Met open armen?: De Duitse annexatie van de Oostkantons in 1940,"['Tiggelen, Coen van']","['Lak, Martijn']",2023-07-13T00:00:54Z,NL,['België ; Eupen-Malmedy ; Oostkantons ; Interbellum ; Tweede Wereldoorlog ; regionale identiteit ; nationale identiteit ; lokale pers'],Geschiedenis van Politiek en Maatschappij,"Deze masterscriptie draait om de vraag in hoeverre er in de Belgische Oostkantons sprake was van pro-Duitse gevoelens onder de bevolking in de aanloop naar de Tweede Wereldoorlog. De Oostkantons, die de regio’s rondom de steden Eupen en Malmedy omvatten, stonden lang onder Duitse controle. Hierdoor was een groot deel van de bevolking ook Duitstalig en georiënteerd op Duitsland. Na de Eerste Wereldoorlog werden de gebieden toegewezen aan België ter compensatie van de geleden oorlogsschade. Doordat Duits de voertaal bleef in de Oostkantons werden de gebieden, na de Duitse bezetting van België in 1940, opnieuw ingelijfd bij Duitsland. Het heersende beeld in de historiografie is dat de bevolking hier in grote mate achter stond. Dit onderzoek heeft getracht te bepalen of dit beeld correct is door te kijken welke houding de lokale pers aannam ten opzichte van Duitse politieke successen tijdens het Interbellum. Een analyse van artikelen uit lokale kranten laat zien dat de pers vooral in neutrale bewoordingen schreef over de Duitse successen. De precieze reden hiervan is moeilijk te achterhalen, maar een mogelijkheid is dat er een sterke ontkoppeling heeft plaatsgevonden in het gebied tussen enerzijds de culturele dimensie (Duits zijn) en de politieke dimensie (nazi zijn). Het lijkt erop dat dit een bewuste tactiek was van pro-Duitse agitatoren om ervoor te zorgen dat een zo breed mogelijk deel van de bevolking het pro-Duitse gedachtegoed zou blijven steunen, ook wanneer ze geen nazi waren. Dit laat zien dat er een heleboel verschillende factoren zijn die een rol kunnen spelen in de vorming van een regionale identiteit en dat deze identiteit ook aan verandering onderhevig is, zeker wanneer het gaat om grensregio’s. De resultaten kunnen dan ook meer inzicht bieden in hoe identiteit zich door specifieke omstandigheden kan ontwikkelen en evolueren."

In 2017 overleed ze op tragische wijze in een kunstgalerie in Bari. Ondanks haar relatief korte bestaan heeft ze ons achtergelaten met een rijkelijk oeuvre, waar nog betrekkelijk weinig onderzoek naar heeft plaatsgevonden. Haar oeuvre staat bekend om het uitgesproken verzet tegen de patriarchale samenleving, wat zich uit in een nauwe samenwerking met mystieke en spirituele praktijken binnen haar kunst. In het kader van het ultra-feminisme onderzoekt dit eindwerkstuk de magische aspecten van het oeuvre van Chiara Fumai aan de hand van een literatuur-en casestudie. De onderzoeksvraag die centraal staat is: hoe gebruikt Chiara Fumai occulte thema’s in haar kunstpraktijk om haar feministische boodschap uit te dragen? De drie werken; Follow This You Bitches, The Book of Evil Spirits en This Last Line Cannot Be Translated worden gebruikt als casestudies en helpen de occulte thematiek en de wijze waarop ze dit toepast binnen haar oeuvre aan te tonen. 
In dit eindwerkstuk wordt Fumai’s gedachtengoed gekaderd door een mengeling van het radicaal en spiritueel feminisme. De feministische boodschap die ze uitdraagt is gericht op de culturele grondoorzaken van genderongelijkheid en stelt dat deze diep geworteld zijn in de structuren en normen van de samenleving. Ze trekt met haar kunst de bestaande geschiedenis in twijfel en richt zich op het bezweren van het patriarchaat. Het oeuvre van Fumai zit vol met occulte rituelen, symbolen en seances, die ze op eigen voorkeur aanpast naar een middel van verzet. Om de occulte thema’s te kunnen analyseren wordt er gebruikgemaakt van de theoretische concepten occulture en seekership, om een beter begrip te krijgen van hoe Fumai zich als hedendaagse kunstenaar verhoudt tot het moderne occultisme. Haar ideeën zijn afkomstig uit een bron van materialen, waarmee ze opnieuw verbinding zoekt met het mystieke en spirituele. Ze gebruikt deze oude wijsheden en tradities voor haar eigen activistische zoektocht binnen haar kunstenaarschap."
Het gebruik van vertaaltechnologie door juridisch vertalers,"['Engbrink, Sabine van']","['Declercq, Christophe']",2023-07-13T00:01:02Z,NL,['Juridisch vertalen; vertaaltechnologie; vertaalgeheugens; termenbanken; vertaalmachines; spraakherkenning.'],Professioneel vertalen,"Deze scriptie doet onderzoek naar het gebruik van vertaaltechnologie door juridisch vertalers. Daarbij beantwoordt de scriptie de volgende onderzoeksvraag ‘In hoeverre prefereren juridisch vertalers het gebruik van vertaaltechnologische hulpmiddelen, zoals vertaalgeheugens, termenbanken, vertaalmachines en spraakherkenning, bij het vertalen van teksten?’. 
Om deze onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden, wordt er in het theoretisch kader een relevant literatuuronderzoek beschreven. Ook is er een enquête afgenomen onder vertalers die op zijn minst af en toe juridisch vertalen om hun gebruik van vertaaltechnologie te onderzoeken.
Hoe het literatuuronderzoek en de enquête zijn uitgevoerd, wordt beschreven in de methodologie. Vervolgens worden in de discussie de resultaten van de enquête gekoppeld aan de literatuur uit het theoretisch kader en zullen er zo conclusies getrokken worden uit de resultaten. De scriptie eindigt met een conclusie waarin de belangrijkste elementen worden samengevat en er een antwoord wordt gegeven op de onderzoeksvraag. Ook zijn de volledige enquête en resultaten terug te vinden in de bijlagen van deze scriptie. 

De belangrijkste resultaten laten zien dat vertalers veel gebruikmaken van vertaaltechnologie, maar dat vertaaltechnologie voor juridisch vertalers nog niet altijd even bruikbaar is. Het vertalen van juridische teksten is een aparte discipline binnen de vertaalwetenschap en brengt verschillende problemen en moeilijkheden met zich mee die nog niet altijd even goed kunnen worden verholpen met behulp van vertaaltechnologie. Het antwoord op de onderzoeksvraag is dan ook als volgt: juridisch vertalers maken, volgens de resultaten uit de enquête, vaak gebruik van vertaaltechnologie, zoals vertaalgeheugens, termenbanken, vertaalmachines en spraakherkenning bij het vertalen van juridische teksten. Terwijl de resultaten uit het literatuuronderzoek suggereren dat vertaaltechnologie nog niet optimaal ontwikkeld is voor gebruik bij juridisch vertalen en dat het wel gebruikt wordt door juridische vertalers, maar in mindere mate dan door vertalers die in een ander vertaaldomein, denk aan technisch, medisch of wetenschappelijk, vertalen."

The study was carried out by means of a corpus-based method, in which the positional change in the translation of the TAs ago, yesterday, and tomorrow was determined by comparing the position in the English source texts to the position in the Dutch target texts. For this, a sample from the OpenSubtitles2018 parallel corpus was used. The hypothesis was that standardisation would exert the strongest influence on the placement on TAs in Dutch target texts, but that the effects of cross-linguistic influence would be evident, too. The most prominent positional change is final position in the English source text to medial position in the Dutch target text. This reflects the conventions of Dutch usage, and thus provides support for the hypothesis that standardisation has the strongest influence on TA positionality in English-to-Dutch translation of subtitles. When individual TAs are considered, however, potential cross-linguistic influence effects are also evident."

First, it is argued that the Capability Approach helps in conceptualizing deliberative democracy, and it is therefore a useful framework in assessing phenomena that might impact deliberative democracy. Second, it is argued that political campaigns in a deliberative democracy should be subject to the same standards as deliberative democracy since campaigns play a decisive role in the deliberation process. Consequently, a comparison between political campaigns and political microtargeting is made. The key difference is that political microtargeting is in nature non-transparent opposed to political campaigns. Third, political microtargeting is assessed based on the impact on five deliberative capabilities: 1) the capabilities of senses, imagination and thought, 2) of emotions, 3) of practical reason, 4) of affiliation, 5) of control over one’s political environment. It is concluded that political microtargeting poses the threat of manipulation, fragmentation, and uneven power structures, which negatively impact the five deliberative capabilities. Measures that are installed are not sufficient to battle these negative effects. Therefore, the conclusion of this thesis is that political microtargeting should be banned."""

Program transformations that manipulate the binding structure are therefore tricky to get right. In a dependently typed programming language such as Agda, we can however make use of intrinsically typed syntax trees to enforce type- and scope-safety by construction, ruling out a large class of binding-related bugs. We show how to perform (and prove correct) dead binding elimination and let- sinking using intrinsically typed de Bruijn indices. To avoid repeated traversals of the transformed expression, we include variable liveness information into the syntax tree and later employ a co-de-Bruijn representation. Finally, we perform transformations in this style syntax-generically."
An Algorithm for Correlation Halving Distance Analysis of Renewable Energy Resources,"['Majid, Mustafa']","['Feelders, Ad']",2023-07-20T00:01:56Z,EN,[],Computing Science,"Europe’s transition from fossil fuel energy to renewable energy sources requires
expensive changes to the continent’s electricity grid that should hold
up for decades. As renewable energy generation methods such as solar and
wind are heavily dependent on changes in the weather, there will be increased
variability in the power supply. To reduce this energy-meteorological variability,
areas of Europe’s grid that have low renewable energy generation correlation
must be discovered. By using conversion models on climate model
output to get relevant energy variables, there is hourly data available for solar
and wind energy capacity factors for each grid cell in Europe. Due to the
sheer number of grid cells in the data (21,019), calculating correlation between
all pairs of grid cells is not feasible without algorithm optimisation.
We introduce a novel metric called the ""Correlation Halving Distance"", which
gives the distance value that indicates at what distance the wind and/or
solar time series yield 0.5 correlation for any given grid cell. We also explore
optimised approaches to calculate the metric efficiently. Here we show
that one algorithm based on Active Learning, called Uncertainty Sampling,
performed the best on synthetic data and was chosen to be tested on real-world
data. In validation, Uncertainty Sampling yields a correlation value
of [0.5±0.05] in 87 out of a 100 experiments with random starting grid cells.
Additionally, each run calculated only 62 correlations on average, greatly
saving on computation cost compared to the brute force approach. We found
that the correlation halving distance values varied greatly by geography.
Grid cells in land-locked and mountainous eastern Switzerland and western
Austria show Correlation Halving Distance values of 105-110 km, while
grid cells in the North Sea area show values in the order of 435-440 km. The
metric could assist in future-proofing changes to Europe’s energy grid as it
transitions to renewable energy, given that many types of renewable energy
sources rely on specific weather conditions. Additionally, spatial interpolation
techniques could be utilised to estimate the Correlation Halving Distance
for cells to further reduce the number of computations."

In this thesis, the concept of contrastiveness will be modelled in various formal argumentation settings. The definition for contrastiveness is based on definitions found in literature from the field of the social sci- ences and humanities. First, an extensive literature research is conducted to find suitable definitions for contrastiveness, then those concepts are modelled in Dung’s abstract argumentation frameworks, preference-based argumentation frameworks and finally in the structured argumentation setting of ASPIC+. These definitions are then evaluated at the hand of examples based on real-life situations. This work successfully models various notions of contrastiveness in various formal argumentation set- tings and paves the way for the further study and application of contrastiveness in (argumentative) XAI."
Evaluation of the efficacy of conventional medication surveillance and clinical rules in daily hospital practice,"['Wouters, Wesley']","['Bouvy, M.L.']",2023-07-20T00:01:35Z,EN,['Medicatiebewaking; signaalmoeheid'],Farmacie,"Background: Alert fatigue is probably one of the biggest downsides of clinical decision support systems based on medication surveillance used in current daily (hospital) practice. Different studies suggest that only 1.4-7.5% of conventional medication surveillance signals require intervention by a pharmacist, while for clinical rules intervention rates of 80-94% are possible. The purpose of this study is to determine the current extent of alert fatigue by calculating the positive predictive value (PPV) for intervention for both types of medication surveillance in the hospital pharmacy of Maasstad Hospital.   

Materials and methods: Data of January 2022, which contained all generated medication surveillance signals during the study period, were extracted from the electronic health records and analyzed retrospectively. The amount of interventions arising from these generated signals was determined. This allowed the PPV to be determined, as well as the amount of advices which were followed by the physician. Based on the data, suggestions for improvement have been made. 

Results and conclusion: In January 2022, 15.016 conventional medication surveillance signals and 1.544 clinical rules have been generated. 0.9% of conventional medication surveillance signals resulted in consultation of a physician by a pharmacist, while 18.9% of clinical rules led to an intervention. For conventional medication surveillance signals 83 of 132 advices (62.9%) were followed, while for clinical rules 165/260 advices (63.5%) were followed by the physician. For conventional medication surveillance, 789 signals were identified which, in future could be disabled and 1.473 signals have been identified which could (partially) be managed by technicians in the future. Optimization of current clinical rules could prevent 279 irrelevant rules. 

Conclusion: The PPV of conventional medication surveillance is very low and introduces the risk of alert fatigue as only 9 out of 1.000 signals lead to an intervention. Although the PPV of clinical rules is higher than the PPV of conventional medication surveillance in the current situation, it is still lower than desired. There is room for improvement of both types of medication surveillance."

Normalized Cut problem is NP-complete on claw-free, split, and complete graphs. Furthermore, we show that the Normalized Cut problem with unweighted edges is strongly
NP-complete in general. On the other hand, we show that the partition with minimum
normalized cut value has two connected components and use this property to construct
polynomial-time algorithms on certain H-free graph classes. We show that we can solve
the Normalized Cut problem on forests in linear time and on outerplanar graphs in
quadratic time. Furthermore, we show that we can solve the Normalized Cut problem
with unweighted edges on cactus and cluster graphs in linear time. Lastly, we observe that
there exists an O(log(n))-approximation algorithm for another graph partitioning problem
to which we can reduce the Normalized Cut problem. Therefore, we have an O(log(n))-

For this reason, we introduce a continuous approach to improve the accuracy. In this thesis, a continuous simulation of plant dispersal is developed, using 1.5d piecewise linear functions as an approximation of distributions of plant dispersal. We create a simulation method that returns an ϵ-approximation of plant distributions and compare this continuous simulation method to the discrete simulation given by Treep. Our results largely confirm the findings by Treep, but imply that in some cases continuous simulation returns kernels that disperse over longer distances."

Trying to Feed the World without Destroying it: The Problems with Modern Agriculture and the Potential of Agroforestry as Part of the Solution,"['Dodds, Beth']","['Kowalchuk, George']",2023-07-22T00:01:56Z,EN,['Agroforestry; industrial agriculture; agroecology; climate change; soil erosion; biodiversity loss'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"Abstract
Industrial agriculture is an important driver in climate change, biodiversity loss, and soil erosion by removing itself from ecological principles of circularity – i.e. away from a system of equal inputs and outputs – and instead focusing primarily on short term profits. Here, agroforestry is provided as a framework to help mitigate the environmental impacts of industrial agriculture: via its carbon sequestration potential; via its ability to provide habitat for important species; and via its ability to improve soil functionality and structure. In addition, agroforestry may improve the climate resilience of agricultural systems, for example by regulating temperature, nutrient and water cycles, and providing means of pest control. This perspective first provides a partial problem analysis of industrial agriculture. It then utilizes a literature review of agroforestry, to help determine the extent to which agroforestry can help lessen the impacts of food production upon the environment. Based upon this analysis, this review concludes that agroforestry practices, such as silvopasture and buffer strips, are economically viable and can be used within agricultural systems to promote biodiversity and soil quality, whilst reducing climate impact. However, policy change, education and knowledge sharing will be required for the realization of large scale agroforestry practices.

Layman Summary 
The purpose of this study was to identify the environmental benefits that agroforestry may provide, and how agroforestry may be implemented into agricultural systems. First, a problem analysis of industrial agriculture was conducted, in order to clearly define the main problems in this system with regards to climate change, soil erosion and biodiversity loss. Then, a literature review of agroforestry was conducted, where agroforestry is defined as the purposeful planting of trees and shrubs within farming systems. Intensive agriculture is today damaging to the environment, and solutions are required: here, agroforestry is proposed as a partial solution. Agroforestry systems provide direct environmental benefits, such as: promoting biodiversity via the provision of increased habitat and resources; slowing climate change by carbon sequestration;  improving soil quality by reducing soil erosion and via the addition of nutrients and soil carbon. Agroforestry may further promote environmental benefits indirectly: for example, agricultural systems may require less artificial fertilizers and pesticides. Agroforestry has been identified as an economically viable system, that is relatively easy to establish, promotes good yields whilst also providing many environmental benefits. Agroforestry has therefore been recommended as a tool to use in agricultural systems to help lower the environmental impacts of agriculture."
Semi-supervised learning for Technology Assisted Review,"['Öz, Ercan']","['Feelders, Ad']",2023-07-22T00:01:54Z,EN,['Technology Assisted Review; Semi-supervised learning; Multinomial Naive Bayes; Label spreading; Support Vector Machine; Work Saved over Sampling; Self-training; Active learning'],Artificial Intelligence,"Finding all documents relevant to a specific information need in a potentially large collection of documents is essential for many researchers. This is essential not only for researchers who need to sift through thousands of studies to determine which studies are relevant for their meta-analysis but also for clinicians, policy-makers, journalists, and even the general public. Technology Assisted Review (TAR) incorporates machine learning algorithms and human feedback to find all relevant documents to achieve complete recall at a minimal cost. This study investigates methods to enhance the performance of TAR.

The availability of labeled data is often limited due to the high costs associated with labeling the data in terms of time and resources. A lack of labeled data can limit a model's capacity for generalization. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques, which use unlabeled data to improve model performance, were examined to address this limitation. This thesis studies various SSL techniques for binary classification and evaluates their contributions to the TAR process.

We compared the performance of five semi-supervised learning classifiers within TAR against their supervised equivalents. The findings highlight that the semi-supervised Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, with many-to-one correspondence via sub-topics, was able to improve the performance over its supervised counterpart multiple times, particularly in the two datasets with the lowest percentage of relevant documents. Significant improvements were also demonstrated for some datasets by combining AutoTAR and semi-supervised Multinomial Naive Bayes with sub-topics, compared to the supervised AutoTAR model. In contrast, label spreading and Support Vector Machines with self-training less frequently outperformed their supervised counterparts. 

Although semi-supervised models did not consistently outperform their supervised counterparts, this research demonstrates the potential for improved performance using semi-supervised models. This was most notably observed with the semi-supervised Multinomial Naive Bayes model with many-to-one correspondence."

the challenges posed by phenomena involving disparate energy scales, where fixed/finite
order perturbation theory fails due to the emergence of large logarithms. SCET provides
a useful framework for breaking down the calculations into different components that depend
on single energy scales, i.e. for derivations of factorisation theorems. The all-order
expressions can then be obtained using scale evolution by solving the renormalization group
equations (RGEs) for each of the pieces appearing in the factorisation formula. This step
is known as resummation. In this master thesis presentation, I delve into the construction
of SCET, focusing on the derivation of the leading power Lagrangian and the calculation of
leading power jet functions with the SCET Lagrangian as well as regular QCD Lagrangian

Impact Host ANKLE2 on the replication of ZIKV,"['Klaessens, Thomas']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-07-27T00:01:43Z,EN,"['ZIKV, ANKLE2, Viral replication, Microcephaly']",Infection and Immunity,"Zika virus became well known in recent years due to an outbreak in the Americas in 2015-2016. This virus spreads though the bites of infected yellow fever mosquitos (Aedes aegypti) that are found in the warmer regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Zika virus typically leads only to minor disease symptoms in healthy adults. However, when a pregnant woman is infected, the virus can pass to her fetus and lead to birth defects. Children being born with a condition called microcephaly, where the head and brain are abnormally small, is the most well-known of these birth defects. Microcephaly leads to many mental handicaps and developmental problems throughout life. How Zika virus infection leads to microcephaly is not fully understood at this point of time. 
Zika virus infects the cells of its host and multiplies using the biological machinery that is present within these cells. To do this the virus hijacks various host proteins within these cells to utilize their functions to help the virus achieve things the virus cannot do with its own proteins. Earlier research has found a possible mechanism that could be behind microcephaly. This research found that Zika virus interacts with a host protein called ANKLE2. Naturally occurring mutations in this protein have been seen in children with microcephaly.
In this project we wanted to find out if Zika virus purposefully hijacks ANKLE2 to facilitate its own replication or if this is just an accidental interaction that has no benefit for Zika virus.
To do this we made cells that could no longer produce the ANKLE2 protein. We then infected these cells with Zika virus and measured the number of infectious viruses present at specific time points after adding the virus. We found that Zika viruses could not multiply as well when the ANKLE2 protein was no longer present within the cell. We tested this for liver, lung, and placental cells to ensure this was not specific to a particular cell type. In addition, we also tested this with different strains of Zika virus to ensure it was not strain specific. These results show that the presence of the ANKLE2 benefits the multiplication of Zika virus in some way. 
We were also curious if the ANKLE2 protein was used by relatives of Zika virus. So, we infected cells without ANKLE2 with either dengue virus or yellow fever virus and measured the number of infectious viruses after specific timepoints. We found that the multiplication of dengue virus was altered when the ANKLE2 protein was no longer present. The effect on yellow fever virus multiplication was very small though. 
It is important to further understand how Zika virus causes microcephaly and how these interactions might benefit the virus. As, the mosquito species that transmits Zika virus is spreading to more countries due to global warming it is becoming more important to understand microcephaly and how to manage it as a future Zika virus outbreak is very possible. And this information could help us develop possible treatments for Zika virus disease related issues."

The aim of this study was to explore the impact of HIV-status on potential depressive disorder (PDD) and gain understanding on the complexity of this relation, by taking into account the influence of HIV-related stigma and community connectedness among HIV-positive MSM (N = 309). Methods: Participants completed an online questionnaire from the “Survey Men and Sexuality”, conducted in 2018. The data was analyzed using both a simple and multiple logistic regression. Results: The study did not find support for the relation between HIV-status and PDD; likelihood of PDD did not differ between HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM. HIV-related stigma was not found to predict PDD among HIV-positive MSM. Additionally, community connectedness did not act as a moderator in the relationship between HIV-related stigma and PDD among HIV-positive MSM. Discussion: The contradictory findings of this study highlight the potential impacts of cultural and temporal contexts, and possibly effective antiretroviral therapies treating HIV, on mental health outcomes. Despite certain limitations, the study underscores the need for ongoing research, stigma reduction efforts, and tailored mental health interventions within this population."

This cross-sectional study used Health Behaviour in School Aged Children 2017 data, which included a representative sample of 7,392 adolescents between 11 and 20 years from the Netherlands (Mage = 14.1, SD = 1.9). The results demonstrated that adolescents with more ADHD symptoms were more likely to engage in unhealthy eating behaviors, and that this association can be partially explained by sleep time. The interdisciplinary approach of the study contributes to the comprehensive understanding of the relationship between ADHD symptoms and unhealthy eating behaviors. This study emphasizes the need for selective interventions that address the challenges faced by adolescents with ADHD symptoms to promote healthy eating behaviors and well-being. Moreover, longitudinal designs are recommended to investigate the directionality of relationships over time."

It examines the relationship between bullying victimization, social support (consisting of family, school and peer support), physical activity and IPB, EPB or both. Data from 8927 primary and high school students (51.2% girls; M age = 14,13, SD = 1.91) who enrolled in the Dutch survey study HBSC (Health Behavior in School-aged Children) from 2017 was used. Through a multiple hierarchical regression it was found that bullying victimization is related to higher rates of IPB and EPB. Social support is related to lower rates of IPB. Family and school support are related to lower rates of EPB. In contrast, peer support relates to higher rates of EPB. Physical activity is related to lower rates of IPB, but not related to EPB. By gaining insight in the factors that are related to IPB and EPB, this study provides guidelines for policy and clarifies target groups for preventive programs. Moreover, it adds to the prevention of further deterioration of well-being among adolescents in the Netherlands."

The results indicate evidence for a significant moderating effect of religious denomination between religiosity and attitudes towards homosexuality. Specifically, this suggests that the relation between religiosity and attitudes towards homosexuality may depend on the religious denomination one adheres to. Educational attainment, however, was not found to have a significant moderating effect, indicating that the relation between religiosity and attitudes towards homosexuality is not altered by higher or lower educational attainment. Results regarding the moderating effect for religious denomination are discussed from a cultural and social perspective. Special attention is given to the minority status of Muslim adolescents in the West. Regarding the role of educational attainment, implications for further research are discussed."

that independent variable stress was related to higher rates of absenteeism. However, 
independent variables adaptive perfectionism, maladaptive perfectionism and social support 
did not have a notable interaction with the relationship between stress and absenteeism.
Regardless, social support and perfectionism were related to stress and school absenteeism.
Both types of perfectionism were related to more stress, whereas social support was related to 
less stress. Adaptive perfectionism was also related to increased school absenteeism, whereas 
social support was related to less absenteeism. Future research should study the dimensions of

These models predicted well-being well with social support from family being the strongest predictor for life satisfaction and school work pressure the strongest predictor for psychosomatic complaints in both countries. Life satisfaction, social support from family and social support from friends are found to be significantly higher in the Netherlands compared to Poland. The strong association between social support from family and life satisfaction and the fact that they are both higher in the Netherlands compared to Poland suggests that social support from family explains the difference in life satisfaction.

Negotiating cultural authenticity with global appeal in the context of transmedia practices and cross-cultural adaptations: The case of Netflix’s The Witcher.,"['Krusheva-Yordanova, Ami']","['Vliet, Diantha']",2023-07-29T00:00:46Z,EN,[],Film and Television Cultures,"Translating literary texts into films requires a combination of fidelity, reinterpretation, and re-contextualization of a source material for the demands of a new audience. The case of Netflix’s The Witcher (a TV series that adapts and expands on the famous Polish fantasy novels written by Andrzej Sapkowski) is further complicated by the culturally-bound nature of both books and games and the expectations related to their worldwide popularity. Although academics agree that they draw mainly from Polish and Slavic mythology, culture, and society, even though combined with Western-European inspirations, the Netflix show remains under-researched.

To contribute to closing the research gap, this thesis analyzes the negotiation between the source’s cultural authenticity, the streaming platform’s multicultural values and demands, and the expectations of the preexisting fan base. In order to shed light upon how and if unique cultural traits are retained and re-contextualized by the creators, perceived by the audience, and how such texts participate in social change, the thesis studies the pilot episode in relation to the official behind-the-scenes special and various online sources. By assigning a Polish producer, changing the focalization of the story, and having the showrunner actively engage with the fandom online, the production of The Witcher reveals creative decisions aimed at a good balance between “local” and “global.” However, the fan-base response to racial diversity and colorblindness shows that the efforts were not successful in showcasing the complexity of today’s society."

Exploring Spitzer’s theory leads to the conclusion that his framework focused on score analysis to delineate emotions falls flat in the case of contemporary popular music. Therefore, moving away from emotion-based score analysis and instead opting for a method of analysis incorporating concepts of modern sound design through recording technologies and affect will provide this expansion. Spitzer’s examination of modern recording technologies is expanded upon by the exploration of modern sound design done by Zachary Wallmark and Paul Théberge. Similarly, sources by Margeret Wetherell, Ian Tucker and Richard Elliott will provide further examination of the concept of affect. This updated framework will be used to analyze the song “Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)” by the American metal band Deftones. Furthermore, one hundred comments taken from ten YouTube videos are examined for their affective responses. These videos are uploaded by fans of the band and are part of a social media trend aiming to visualize what it feels like to listen to the music of Deftones. The affective responses present in YouTube comments will be compared with the findings of the updated musical analysis in order to prove its effectivity. Ultimately, this thesis provides a new perspective on contemporary popular music analysis through the proposed incorporation of affect and sound design as an expansion of Spitzer’s framework."

The predominant focus will be on explaining a perceived ‘shift’ in European response from democratic hopefulness to a more pessimistic attitude towards Islam’s incompatibility with democracy. This research contains analysis of ideology in interpretations and representation by examining the use of particular language in Dutch talk shows and connecting this to theories of MENA (Middle East North Africa) misrepresentation: Joris Luyendijk’s theory concerns faulty mechanisms in Dutch news production, which are systemic issues in media representation; Edward Said’s theory of Orientalism focuses on ways through which Europe historically shaped the world through its relationships with others, which I believe contributes to misrepresentation and subsequent misinterpretation. Said’s theory is concerned with expressions of ‘othering’, and as such, connects this othering to language and ideology. Said explains that the idea of a ‘backward Islam’ is constructed through European self-identification as the opposite of the Orient, and as such, must be compared to European self-identification of itself as modern. Given that the Arab Uprisings represent initial European hope concerning democracy in ‘the Arab world’, the Arab Uprisings provide a proxy for investigating the role of modernity in how Europe interprets itself and its relationship with the other. This thesis departs from the expectation that particular definitions of modernity play a role in explaining the shift from European hope to pessimism on prospects of democracy. Findings indicate that this shift is less drastic than it initially appears, revealing that both predominant interpretations have similarities seemingly invisible in liberal ideology. Furthermore this research finds that modernity plays a significant role in informing cultural domination, and concludes with recommendations based on the analysis of representation."

For this design, we will seek inspiration from philosopher Hannah Arendt and propose an alternative approach that will stimulate the fulfilment of these goals by offering a transformative and humane prison environment. Arendtian conditions essential for prisoners to experience a humane existence and reintegrate into society will be developed. These Arendtian conditions will be based on Arendt’s theory on vita contemplativa (thinking, willing, judging), the vita activa (labor, work, action), and the public and private realms. From Arendt’s anthropological theory, I will argue that prisons should be designed to mirror society, offer prisoners a sense of normality and stimulate (moral) responsibility and agency. To translate the Arendtian conditions to practical advice in the context of prison, real-world examples, the Norwegian prisons Bastøy and Halden, will be used. This thesis will conclude with the recommendation for the DCIA to adopt a similar approach to the Norwegian Correctional Service to fulfil its mission and meet the Arendtian conditions of humane imprisonment."

Low-Income Families Facing Food Insecurity in Amsterdam North: A Qualitative Analysis on the Barriers and Enablers of Healthy Food Choices,"['Los Rios Torres, Estefania De']","['Stok, Marijn']",2023-08-04T00:01:58Z,EN,"['Healthy food choices, low-income families, food insecurity, disadvantaged neighborhoods, food environment, non-communicable diseases, qualitative research.']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Drawing on socio-ecology theory, this qualitative study seeks to explore the barriers and enablers of healthy food choices among Dutch low-income families experiencing food insecurity. The negative health effects of unhealthy food choices are more prevalent in low-income families who face food insecurity, than other socio-economic groups. In Amsterdam, these families often live in disadvantaged neighborhoods that are characterized by a high prevalence of obesity. This study therefore aims to inform targeted interventions and policy in Amsterdam North. Method: In-depth semi-structured PDPE (participant-driven photo-elicitation) interviews were conducted with parents (n = 10), residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Amsterdam North. Results: This study discovered six barriers (convenience, personal preference, children’s preferences, Ramadan, availability of unhealthy food, and rising costs), and eleven enablers (food knowledge and skills, personal preference, children’s preferences, parental encouragement, children’s activities and community support, family support, religion and culture, school environment, availability, and access to healthy food). Some factors were both barriers and enablers. Discussion: The contrast between healthy eating efforts, rising food costs, and the increasingly unhealthy food environment in neighborhoods like Amsterdam North shows how individual and social enablers may easily unravel. Conclusion: This study finds that efforts to modify food choices and eating habits should go beyond individual and social level interventions. The findings intend to contribute to more integrated policies towards the reduction of obesity, food insecurity, and health inequalities among disadvantaged neighborhoods of Amsterdam North."
“En op een gegeven moment worden het een soort van vriendinnen”: Relaties en sociale steun bij de Amsterdamse spelinloop,"['Bencan, Reyhan']","['Slot, Pauline']",2023-08-04T00:02:05Z,NL,['playgroup; social support; emotional support; parenting; parent support'],"Youth, Education and Society","Abstract
Rationale: Playgroups are a low-threshold form of parental support with a preventive focus. Although positive outcomes of playgroups are mediated by social support experienced by parents, playgroups’ social function has been understudied in scientific literature. Purpose: This study aims to investigate the relationships between staff, volunteers and parents at playgroups and their impact on parents' experience of social support. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff and volunteers (N=4) and parents (N=12) at playgroups in Amsterdam. Thematic analysis was utilized to examine the nature of relationships between staff, volunteers, and parents, as well as the perceived social support. Results: Staff-volunteers describe their own role as supporters and points of contact, while parents often describe them as facilitators of activities and creators of a social atmosphere.
Relationships between parents and staff-volunteers are perceived as equal. Parents experience support from active involvement of staff members. Parents’ relationships center around experiences of parenthood. Sharing this experience fosters a sense of recognition and reassurance. Conclusion: Staff-volunteers play a pivotal role in shaping and encouraging social relationships at playgroups. These relationships form the foundation for the support parents experience. The equal and friendly nature of these relationships makes parents feel connected to playgroups and instills confidence that help, and support are available when needed. This study highlights the importance of promoting contacts with and between parents at playgroups.

Samenvatting
Aanleiding: Spelinloop is een laagdrempelige vorm van ouderondersteuning met een preventieve insteek. Hoewel positieve uitkomsten van spelinloop worden gemedieerd door sociale steun die ouders ervaren is de sociale functie van spelinlopen onderbelicht in wetenschappelijke literatuur. Doel: Het doel van dit onderzoek is het bieden van inzicht in de relaties tussen medewerkers, vrijwilligers en ouders bij spelinloop en de rol die deze relaties spelen in het ervaren van sociale steun door ouders. Methode: Er zijn semigestructureerde interviews afgenomen met medewerkers en vrijwilligers (N=4) en ouders (N=12) bij de Amsterdamse spelinloop. Met thematische analyse zijn relaties van medewerkers-vrijwilligers en ouders en de waargenomen sociale steun onderzocht. Resultaten: Medewerkers-vrijwilligers omschrijven hun eigen rol als ondersteuner en aanspreekpunt, terwijl ouders vaker het begeleiden van activiteiten en het creëren van een sociale sfeer benoemen. Relaties tussen ouders en medewerkers-vrijwilligers worden ervaren als gelijkwaardig. Ouders ervaren steun aan de betrokkenheid van medewerkers-vrijwilligers. Relaties van ouders centreren zich om ervaringen van ouderschap. Het delen van deze ervaring biedt ouders herkenning en geruststelling. Conclusie: Medewerkers-vrijwilligers hebben een spilfunctie in het vormgeven en aanmoedigen van sociale relaties bij spelinloop. Deze relaties vormen de basis voor de steun die ouders ervaren. Het gelijkwaardige en vriendschappelijke karakter van deze relaties maakt dat ouders zich verbonden voelen met spelinloop en er vertrouwen in hebben dat hulp en ondersteuning beschikbaar zijn als ze het nodig hebben. Het onderzoek toont het belang van aanmoediging van contacten met en tussen ouders bij spelinloop aan.

Le but de cette recherche était de voir si l’approche par tâches est assortie au système scolaire unique de l’enseignement ciblé (Doelgericht Leren) à cette école. Dans ce système, les élèves suivent des cours d’instruction avec leur classe, mais ils suivent aussi des heures flexibles pour chaque matière. Dans ces heures flexibles, ils travaillent sous la direction d’un professeur de cette matière. Ils choisissent leurs propres objectifs d’apprentissage et la manière dont ils veulent atteindre ces objectifs. Tous les élèves de la classe de seconde du niveau havo qui suivent le français ont participé à la recherche. Avant l’intervention, ils ont rempli une enquête pour avoir une pré-mesure de leur motivation et une auto-évaluation de leurs compétences langagières et de leur effectivité pendant les heures flexibles. Puis, ils ont travaillé en groupes de trois ou quatre élèves sur deux tâches pendant deux mois. Les tâches portaient sur le sport, la culture et les voyages. Après chaque tâche, les élèves ont rempli le questionnaire Intrinsic Motivational Inventory (IMI) et ils ont évalué le processus dans un entretien de classe avec leur professeur. Après l’intervention, ils ont rempli de nouveau l’enquête sur leur motivation et l’auto-évaluation de leurs compétences langagières et de leur effectivité. L’effectivité des élèves pendant les cours a augmenté. Ils ont consacré plus d’heures flexibles au français et selon leur auto-évaluation ils ont travaillé plus effectivement. Les compétences langagières concernant l’interaction dans la langue cible ont augmenté, mais nous n’avons pas vu de grandes différences au niveau des autres compétences. Nous n’avons pas pu démontrer une augmentation convaincante de la motivation intrinsèque. La manière dont ils sont motivés pour le français n’a pas beaucoup changé non plus. Les élèves ont ressenti du plaisir et un sentiment de compétence pendant le travail aux tâches et ils ont ressenti peu de tension et d’autonomie. Ce dernier résultat est un argument contre l’instauration de l’approche par tâches dans l’enseignement ciblé à De Nieuwe Veste, bien que le système scolaire se prête bien à cette manière de travailler.

From “Hitler-Regime” to “Human Rights Abuses”. An Analysis of the Chili Komitee Nederland’s Discourse in Addressing the Pinochet Regime 1973-1989,"['Segeren, Enora']","['Mavrodin, Corina']",2023-08-05T00:00:42Z,EN,"['Human Rights, Pinochet, Chili Komitee Nederland, Solidarity Movement']",International Relations in Historical Perspective,"The international reaction to Pinochet’s coup d’état in Chile and its violent aftermath were an important catalyst for the promulgation of human rights culture in the ‘70s. International organisations, national governments and domestic solidarity committees started using a rhetoric of human rights, some exclusively, others as part of a wider arsenal of narratives that could be utilized in denouncing the Chilean junta and their policies. The protracted nature of the CKN activity, spanning some 16 years, has enabled us to see within a single organisation the rise of human rights rhetoric in the international system through their publications and propaganda materials. The progression is quite significant, from a more ideologically oriented contrast of leftist values versus capitalism (or fascism) to opting into the depoliticized human rights culture, albeit on their own terms. The committee was, however, remarkably late in making the switch to a messaging framework informed by concerns for human rights, even when compared to similar solidarity movements in other countries. This deviation from the general tendencies could be attributed to the existence of other adequate understandings of the Chilean situation in terms of fascism and anti-imperialism that were already shared among the different domestic and foreign networks, coupled with the fact that the depoliticized nature of human rights discourse did not mesh well with the explicitly political nature of the CKN’s interest in Chile. During the ‘80s the focus of the committee’s messaging increasingly came to lie with abuses in the realm of political and civil rights, partly because a rhetoric based on leftist ideals was losing relevancy and partly because the human rights discourse by that time had been firmly established and was more suitable to arouse engagement from the population."
Examining the effect of fluid flow on the stress and strain evolution of Dutch geothermal reservoirs and the implications for induced seismicity,"['Vogel, Lynn']","['Dinther, Ylona van']",2023-08-04T00:01:50Z,EN,['solid-fluid coupling; 2D model; numerical model; geothermal energy; induced seismicity; geothermal;'],Earth Structure and Dynamics,"Geothermal energy is expected to produce 23% of the total heat demand in the
Netherlands by 2050. As geothermal energy production is known to induce seismicity,
risk assessment is crucial for a safe transition to new energy sources. The
exact mechanisms inducing seismicity in geothermal reservoirs are, however, very
complex and poorly understood.
In this thesis, a fully coupled seismo-hydro-mechanical numerical code by Petrini
(2019) is adapted to work for a geothermal setting with a set-up that represents the
Dutch subsurface. The main goal is to investigate whether this code is suited for
studying such a setting and to debug any potential mistakes in the code. Furthermore,
the aim is to investigate how stress and strain build-up due to geothermal
energy production in the Dutch subsurface. Lastly, a parameter study is executed
to examine the effect of operational parameters (injection and production rates) and
fault material parameters.
The adapted code successfully triggers multiple (seismic) events, giving insight
into the relationship between fluid flow and solid deformation during multiple phases:
1) inter-seismic, 2) nucleation, 3) propagation, and 4) post-seismic. The seismicity
that was triggered, however, was very mild (ML<2.0), meaning that it would not be
felt at the surface.
While the code is very efficient in examining the short-term effects (i.e. less than
a year) of geothermal energy production, it requires too much computational time
to see what happens if geothermal energy were to be produced long-term (i.e. for
decades of production). Insights are offered into why the computational time is so
long and solutions are offered for future work."
The Experience of Young Adult Former Volunteers Within the Salesian Community in Malta,"['Farrugia, Glen']","['Sarti, Assia']",2023-08-04T00:02:03Z,EN,['volunteering; Salesian community; former volunteers; life circumstances; life-events'],"Youth, Education and Society","This study is about the experience of young adult former volunteers within the Maltese Salesian family. It aims to explore the changing life circumstances and new life-events which led these young adults to end their involvement in volunteering. It also seeks to find alternatives which would be more accessible to these young adults in their current life status.

	This work indicates that volunteering in the Salesian style has a pedagogical character, helping young people grow and develop their skills and values. Priorities for young adult volunteers change throughout their life course, with family and work taking over their volunteering commitments. Some participants also mention not fitting in with the experience any longer due to new leadership, an age gap between them and new members, or other difficulties which had occurred. However, despite not being involved in volunteering any longer, participants still consider volunteering as an important value in their lives, and in the lives of their family, with most parents stating that they would like to see their children involved in the sector too in the future. Finally, participants describe experiences which would be more accessible to them, mainly episodic volunteering, family volunteering, online volunteering and volunteering related to their profession."
Bidirectional relationship between Compulsive Pornography Use and Mental Health Issues: The Role of Body-esteem and Quality Parent-Child Relationship among Adolescents,"['Mišljenčević, Max']","['Eijnden, R.J.J.M. van den']",2023-08-04T00:01:52Z,EN,"['Pornography, Adolescent, Adolescent Development, Body Esteem']",Youth Studies,"Use of internet porn is growing rapidly. Abuse of porn appears to be positively related to mental health issues among adolescents. Insights into this relationship are relevant to understand how porn abuse and mental health issues are related and may be mitigated. However, existing studies fall short in providing insights as they are mainly based on cross-sectional data, rarely consider a bidirectional relationship and fail to study relevant underlying mechanisms such as levels of body-esteem, and potential risk groups such as adolescents with low quality of parent-child relationships. Therefore, using two waves of longitudinal data (n=275, Mage = 15.06) from Dutch adolescents that participated the Studies on Trajectories of Adolescent Relationships and Sexuality research project, this study investigates bidirectional relationship between compulsive porn use and mental health issues considering mediation by body-esteem and moderation by the quality of parent-child relationships. The findings indicate that compulsive porn use does not lead to significantly higher chance of mental health issues and mental health issues do not lead to significantly higher odds for compulsive porn use. Because of the absence of significant associations between mental health issues and compulsive porn use mediation by body-esteem could not be tested. It could therefore not be detected that these effects occur through affecting body-esteem, nor was a direct correlation between body-esteem and compulsive porn use found. A higher quality of parent-child relationship did, however, impact the relationship between mental health issues and compulsive porn use, though inverse of expectations. Based on the study’s findings, alternative explanations and avenues for future research are discussed."
Time Spent on Informal Childcare and Parents’ Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Is there a Gender Difference?,"['Oosterom, Merel']","['Hoogenboom, Marcel']",2023-08-04T00:02:00Z,EN,[],Social Policy and Public Health,"Introduction: It is important to understand the potential positive and negative consequences of COVID-19 measures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of changes in informal childcare time on parents' well-being, with a focus on gender. It was hypothesized that increased childcare time would negatively impact mental health, moderated by gender. Methods: This study merged three datasets from the LISS panel, encompassing comprehensive information on childcare time, mental health, gender, and other relevant factors. Data were analyzed with multiple linear regression and the PROCESS tool. Results: Contrary to expectations, changes in childcare time did not significantly influence parents' mental health. Gender did not moderate the relationship between childcare time and mental health. However, parents' mental health in 2019 appeared to influence their mental well-being in 2020, indicating pre-existing conditions were important during the pandemic. Discussion: The study revealed that mothers increased their time in childcare more than fathers, aligning with previous research. However, contrary to expectations, these changes in childcare time did not significantly influence parents' mental health. Moreover, gender did not moderate the relationship between childcare time and mental health as hypothesized. Notably, the study demonstrated that parents' mental health prior to the pandemic significantly influenced their mental health during the lockdown. This finding emphasizes the importance of considering pre-existing mental health conditions when addressing the well-being of parents during crisis situations. Conclusion: Overall, this study adds valuable insights to the existing literature, challenging preconceived notions about the relationship between childcare, gender, and mental health. By considering the complexities of these factors, policymakers can create informed policies that prioritize the mental health of parents and promote a more equitable and supportive society."
Joint inversion of receiver functions and surface wave dispersion to resolve the depth dependent shear wave velocity structure of the Botswana crust,"['Vos, Sietse']","['Paulssen, Hanneke']",2023-08-10T00:03:40Z,EN,['Seismology; Receiver functions; Surface waves; Botswana; Crustal structure; Joint inversion; Moho'],Earth Structure and Dynamics,"I jointly inverted receiver functions with surface wave dispersion data to resolve the one-dimensional shear wave velocity structure below the seismic stations of the Botswana Seismic Network. This was done to improve our understanding of the Precambrian crust of Botswana. A joint inversion allows for better constraints on the velocity structure than either data set alone could and was done using a trans-dimensional Bayesian approach. The one- dimensional models showed four main features. Many models showed evidence for a low velocity sedimentary layer overlying the crystalline basement. I also often found a well resolved discontinuity at around 11 kilometers depth. I have interpreted this discontinuity as the Conrad discontinuity marking the transition from a felsic upper crust to an intermediate middle crust. At a depth of approximately 35 kilometers most models show a discontinuity where the shear wave velocity jumps to a higher value of between the 4.2 km/s and 4.5 km/s. This high velocity layer is interpreted as the consequence of mafic underplating during one of the magmatic events that affected southern Africa. I have interpreted the Moho where the shear wave velocity exceeds 4.2 km/s. In Botswana, the crustal thickness varies quite strongly between 33 and 52 kilometers. The thin crust in north- northeast Botswana is probably related to recent rifting in the Okavango Rift Zone and the thick crust near the boundary between the Zimbabwe craton and the Magondi belt is probably related to intrusion of the Okavango dyke swarm."

in spintronics is magnetization dynamics, often described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.
This equation accurately describes the dynamics of many spin systems, and has been experimentally
confirmed. However, there have been theoretical predictions that this equation is not complete,
and should be expanded with inertial terms. Recently, this prediction has been confirmed by
the observation of nutation on top of the precessional magnetization dynamics by various experimental
studies, which suggest that more investigation into spin inertia is needed. In this thesis,
we demonstrate that spin inertia is an effect due to the environment of the spins. Moreover, we
consider an explicit example of a phonon bath as the environment. Our results demonstrate that
there is indeed spin inertia, and we provide a calculation of the inertial constant in the case of a
ferromagnetic thin film in contact with a bulk phonon bath. To experimentally validate our results
we propose investigating an Yttrium Iron Garnet film in contact with a bulk Gadolinium Gallium
Garnet substrate."
Feasibility and Preliminary Effects of a Stress Management Intervention (‘Prikkelbalansgroep’) in Young Adults with Autism Symptoms,"['Wormgoor, Tessa']","['Bodden, D.']",2023-08-10T00:03:51Z,EN,['‘Prikkelbalansgroep’; autism/Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); intervention; patients; therapists; experts; satisfaction; stress; overstimulation; coping strategies'],"Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Background: The existing intervention options for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have yielded questionable results. Altrecht has introduced a new intervention, the ‘Prikkelbalansgroep’, which focuses on reducing stress and overstimulation and increasing the use of coping strategies in young adults with autism symptoms. Research shows potential for the used elements within this intervention. Aim: This study examines whether the ‘Prikkelbalansgroep’ reduces stress and overstimulation and increases the use of coping strategies in young adults. Additionally, this study explores the interventions’ feasibility according to experts, patients, and therapists. The findings aim to contribute to the development and refinement of the intervention. Method: Two female participants, both 22 years old (M = 22.69, SD = .16), exhibiting autism symptoms, completed various questionnaires to examine preliminary effects. Using effect sizes pre- and post measurements have been compared. Additionally, 11 experts, 44 therapists, and 28 patients completed questionnaires to determine feasibility. SPSS was used to analyze and cluster their responses. Results: The pilot study demonstrated that the two young adults report increased stress (d = -1.34) and overstimulation (d = .04 – -.80). Moreover, they reported using more coping strategies (d = -0.65). Both experts, patients, and therapists indicated that the intervention is feasible, but provided several suggestions for improvement. Conclusion: This study presents the first examination of the feasibility and preliminary effects of the ‘Prikkelbalansgroep’. However, due to the severely small sample size, future research should include a larger sample size to draw conclusions regarding effectiveness. The inclusion of expert opinions, patient and therapist feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness measures provide valuable insights into the intervention’s potential and areas of improvement, making it more adapted to its users."

Parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire to measure children's externalizing behavior. The results showed that there is no significant relationship between language proficiency and externalizing behavior. A significant association was found between language proficiency and Theory of Mind, and between Theory of Mind and externalizing behavior. Future research on these constructs, taking into account multiple informants to measure externalizing behavior and taking into account a slow effect of language proficiency on children's behavior, should determine whether there is no relationship between language ability and externalizing behavior in preschool-aged children. Furthermore, follow-up research could determine the causative underlying factors underlying externalizing behavior, since externalizing behavior problems could be a precursor to long-term antisocial behavior and mental health problems.

Therefore, it is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the development of rule-breaking behavior in boys. This study explored the association between parents’ internal attributions about rule-breaking behavior in boys, and whether this association is mediated by parents’ use of harsh discipline. Participants included 134 US parents of boys between 5 and 7 years old. Parents were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and completed an online survey. Internal attributions and harsh discipline were assessed through different scenarios displaying child misbehavior in which parents were asked to imagine their child acted in the way illustrated in the scenarios. Rule-breaking behavior was assessed through the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Overall, findings revealed a partial mediation effect. The more parents made internal attributions about their sons’ misbehavior, the more this was associated with harsh discipline, which in turn was associated with more rule-breaking behavior in boys. Therefore, interventions might benefit from strategies aimed at promoting constructive attributions about misbehavior and more appropriate discipline practices that may lead to a healthier development in children."

CITO reading comprehension proficiency scores were used to measure reading comprehension performance in students. Proximity in the teacher-student relationship was not found to be a predictor of reading comprehension. Conflict, on the other hand, was found to be a moderate significant predictor of reading comprehension in grades two and grade three in the simultaneously relationship. However, in the longitudinal correlation after adjustment for reading comprehension in grade two, conflict was no longer found to be a significant predictor for reading comprehension. Nevertheless, previous reading comprehension performance was found to be a strong predictor of later reading comprehension performance. Furthermore, gender was not found to be a significant moderator. Because reading comprehension performance from previous years is very influential for future reading performance, it is important to focus on good reading instruction early so that later academic success can be positively influenced, and low literacy can be minimized."

"The physical solution space for mangrove restoration 
and conservation for coastal flood protection in the Mekong River 
Delta","['Antvelink, Berend']","['Middelkoop, Hans']",2023-08-15T00:01:04Z,EN,['mangroves;solution space;Mekong River Delta;delta management;Dynamic Mangrove Model;DMM'],"Earth, Life and Climate","The Mekong River Delta (MRD) in Vietnam is currently under severe threat of coastal flooding due 
to rapid growth and industrialisation of the delta population and climate change. Mangrove restoration
and conservation (MRaC) is known to protect against coastal flooding, among other valuable ecosystem 
services and is thus a promising nature based solution to this problem in the MRD. However, uncertainty
exist about the long-term effectiveness of mangroves to protect against coastal flooding under large 
SLR, subsidence and low sediment input conditions that are present in the MRD. 
Defining “solution space” can help decision makers tackle future uncertainty of adaptation measures 
(Haasnoot et al. 2020). The solution space represents the boundaries of what is economically, politically, 
socially, and technically possible (""room to manoeuvre”). It consists of the different possible ways of 
action regarding climate adaptation and their estimated costs, risks, difficulties and benefits in the longterm future, and is constantly changing its form due to new insights, views and opportunities.
This study’s goal is to identify and describe the “physical” solution space for MRaC in the MRD 
until 2100. Physical is defined here as the climatic and environmental conditions that will allow effective 
protection from mangroves against flooding. The results could support decision makers to (1) work 
towards (a) the total solution space of MRaC in the MRD and (b) the solution space of climate adaptation 
measures in the MRD as a whole. Finally, a better understanding of the physical solution space will 
support decision makers in the MRD with legislation for mangrove protection and restoration.
To this end I made a spreadsheet model that calculates, along 1D profiles, where and if mangroves 
survive and can protect against flooding in the future: the Dynamic Mangroves Model (DMM). The 
model is based on the 6 most influential physical factors for MRaC identified in this study: 1) current 
elevation of the MRD coastal profile (geomorphology), (2) SLR, (3) subsidence (natural and humaninduced), (4) tidal range, (5) human-induced mangrove barriers, (6) sedimentation within mangroves 
that is dependent on suspended sediment input (SSC), and organic matter accumulation. Nine selected 
profiles along the southeastern (SE) MRD coast were modelled according to 3 linked scenarios for SLR, 
land subsidence, sediment supply and placement of embankments: (S1) sustainable: SSP1-2.6 with an 
embankment retreat of 5 km, a gradual sediment supply increase to +50% in 2100 and no more 
groundwater extraction, (S2) middle of the road: SSP2-4.5 with an embankment retreat of 2.5 km, a 
stable sediment supply and without increasing groundwater extraction, (S3) fossil fuel development: 
SSP5-8.5 with no embankment retreat, a gradual sediment supply decrease to -50% in 2100 and an 
increasing groundwater extraction (3% per year increase). 
The average flooding date of the simulated MRD profiles ranged from the year ~2065 in S3 to ~2095
in S2 to ~2110+ in S1 (2110 being maximum in the simulation). However, even in the sustainable best 
case scenario and using all adaptation measures considered in this research, RSLR will still occur at the 
SE MRD coast. Eventually, without extra mitigation measures the SE MRD will drown. The most important physical factors that impede MRaC in the MRD are 1) SLR, 2) decreased sediment input, 3) human-induced subsidence, and 4) limited space for mangroves to retreat. Because of sedimentation feedback effects, combining multiple mitigation measures will have a greater total positive influence on MRaC solution space than the sum of the effect of each individual measure. It is thus recommended to implement MRaC in conjunction with other mitigation strategies to maximally extend the MRD lifetime and buy crucial time to adapt."
"The cause of terrestrial biodiversity turnover, during the Triassic_Jurassic boundary, using spore darkness as a climate proxy","['Vermeer, Jurre']","['Schootbrugge, Bas van der']",2023-08-15T00:01:10Z,EN,['spore darkness; FTIR; Palynomorph Darkness Index; wildfire; Triassic Jurassic boundary; Schandelah-1'],"Earth, Life and Climate","The End Triassic mass-extinction was caused by large scale volcanism in the Central American Magmatic Province (CAMP). The events following the volcanism which led to the mass extinction on land remain unclear. While doing research into the end-Triassic mass extinction in the terrestrial realm, a band of darker spores under the Triassic Jurassic boundary was found. It is hypothesized that this so called “Dark zone” is caused by stress in the terrestrial ecosystem. To research what caused the palynomorphs to become darker this project focused on obtaining a record of the darkness of smooth trilete spores across the end-Triassic extinction event in the Scandelah-1 core. To get an indication of the difference in chemical composition between dark and light spores, spores were also examined with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. There was no significant difference between light and dark spores visible in the FTIR spectra, leading to those results being discarded for the purpose of this research. The record of the palynomorph darkness index (PDI) was more useful. The PDI record seems to be closely following the spore/pollen ratio and δ13C record. The PDI also showed some similar trends to the Charcoal abundance record. There also appears to be some cyclicity in the records. These results lead to the conclusion that high temperatures caused by forest fires causes spores to become darker. Charcoal is a proxy for forest fires and the spore pollen ratio is also in agreement with the trends that the charcoal data shows. The mechanism to explain the darkening caused by forest fires is that with high temperatures the sporopollenin in the spore wall changes chemically to get a darker color. The cyclicity could be an indication that these fires are forced by Milankovitch cycles."

However, the effectiveness of AR in late primary and early secondary education, specifically for subjects like chemistry, is still unclear. This study aimed to contribute to the ongoing discussion about the impact of AR on learning and interest by comparing the effects of a game-based AR condition with an interactive 2D environment in a real classroom setting. The research question is: ""Is there a difference in learning outcomes and interest between the use of game-based augmented reality and an interactive 2D environment for chemistry lessons for children in late primary and early secondary education.” The game-based AR group outperformed the 2D group in terms of learning, with a small to medium effect (η2p = .06). There was no difference in interest found between the two groups. However, the last conclusion should be interpreted carefully, since the power was not met, and glitches during the gameplay might have had an impact on the participants’ interest."
Optimization of the automatic annotation of triglycerides in mass spectrometry retention chromatography spectra in R,"['Veldman, Birgit']","['Lest, Chris van de']",2023-08-15T00:01:06Z,EN,['lipidomics; annotation; algorithm; automisation; optimisation; R; ;RTMS'],Toxicology and Environmental Health,"The development of high-performance mass spectrometry (MS) techniques in combination with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has become indispensable in lipidomics studies. As lipidomics produces a vast amount of data, robust bioinformatics is needed for analysis. After data processing and analysis, lipid annotation can be performed. However, lipid annotation methods have not been optimized yet and are dependent on the manual drawing of polygons around lipid classes. In this study an attempt was made to find an alternative approach for the annotation of triglycerides (TGs) in mass spectrometry (MS) chromatography analyses that was not dependent on the manual drawing of polygons. As non-polar lipids, such as triglycerides (TGs), diacylglycerols (DGs), and ceramides, tend to show a linear pattern in the graphical representations of RT-MS spectra, the use of linear regression models was proposed. The regression models were developed with the dataset deduced from the manual polygonal drawing method and compared to an alternative algorithm, that was not dependent on the manual polygonal drawing method. Several linear regression models were developed to investigate the correlation between mass and retention time: a univariate, a two-variate, and a multivariate regression model were created. Strong correlations (R2 > 0.99) were found for all three regression models derived from the polygonal-derived dataset. However, all three models of the datasets derived from the alternative algorithm showed a poor correlation between retention time and (dependent variables of) mass/charge (m/z) for the alternative algorithm. To conclude, the use of linear regression models shows promising results, however, optimization of the alternative algorithm is needed prior application in the field of lipidomics. With the use of linear regression models and the alternative algorithm, we hope to optimize and automate lipid annotation for further studies."

Previous studies have measured child mental health solely from maternal reports. This may cause reporting bias, therefore the current study used both maternal and self-reports to measure adolescent internalizing problems.
The sample consisted of 200 adolescents with a average age of 11.6 years, including 102 girls and 96 boys, and their mothers. Adolescents were examined in the last year of elementary school through elementary schools nationwide. During the conflict task, mother-child interactions were observed using the Continuous Assessment of Interpersonal Dynamics (CAID method).
Results showed that there was a postitive relationship between mother's depressive symptoms and adolescent's internalizing problems. This suggests that when mothers experience symptoms of depression, adolescents are more likely to develop internalizing problems. This relationship was not mediated by maternal warmth. Moreover, the adolescents themselves reported significantly more internalizing problems than their mothers.
Other factors in the mother-child interaction may possibly play a more important role. It is important to involve mothers in early detection, prevention and appropriate interventions for adolescent internalizing problems beyond just the adolescent themselves. Further research is needed to better understand maternal warmth and other important factors in mother-child interaction."

It is hypothesized that the positiverelation between authoritative parenting and self-esteem in adolescents is mediated by autonomy in adolescents. The data was obtained through self-evaluation surveys conducted among adolescents for the constructs of autonomy and self-esteem, and through observation of parent-child interactions for the construct authoritativeness. Participants were Dutch (96.7%), adolescents(50% girls and boys; MAge= 11.5), in transition from primary to secondary education, and their parents (85% mothers, Mage= 44). Although the mediation analysis shows a significant positive relationship between autonomy and self-esteem, such is not the case for the hypothesized positive relation between authoritativeness and self-esteem and authoritativeness and autonomy. There was also no indirect effect found in this research, and thus no mediation. For practitioners in the field of youth care, insights into the relation between autonomy and self-esteem can be useful in improving treatment protocols for adolescents with autonomy and self-esteem issues. It is recommended that future research takes this study further over a longer time to obtain longitudinal data."
The Dutch Critical Infrastructure under NIS2 Directive: A Cybersecurity Risk-management Approach.,"['Gonzalez Pouso, Virginia']","['Georgieva, Z.R.']",2023-08-23T14:00:47Z,EN,['Cybersecurity risk-management; implementation; NIS2 Directive; critical infrastructure; transportation; digital infrastructure'],European Governance,"Digitalisation is currently a hot topic in the EU and the Netherlands specifically, as EU- level NIS and NIS2 Directives have arisen to achieve a high level of cybersecurity. However, these directives and the speed at which they must be met are a double-edged sword. Though it allows for better connections and eases in monitoring the daily online activity of Member States that share a common interest in cybersecurity, the regulations are rather slow to adapt to the quickly changing nature of ICT systems. Further, every Member State has different levels of digitalisation and different resources at its disposal to reach and maintain a high common level of digitalisation.

To ensure the uninterrupted provision of vital services such as transportation and digital infrastructure, it is imperative that the critical infrastructure of EU Member States is prepared to confront cyber-attacks, system vulnerabilities, and risks in the digital domain. The implementation of a robust and actively enforced risk-management framework plays a crucial role in this regard. When essential processes like electricity or water supply, management of shipping traffic, or payment transactions become targets, society can be brought to a standstill for an unknown period of time.
In light of this, the EU legislative framework tries to be updated to present times after different digital proposals such as NIS (1&2), CER, CRA, or DORA, but there is often a misunderstanding of what these laws mean in practice and what extent national entities are responsible for implementing them.

This research work explores the extent to which cybersecurity risk-management measures in light of the NIS2 Directive are effectively monitored, developed, and practiced by Dutch governmental entities, as well as private organisations’ effect on the public enforcement of the measures, and the extent to which these measures are complied with in practice. Lastly, this research work comes up with policy recommendations to address the challenges encountered in practice."
"Interactions of the BRCA1-BRCT domain with ABRAXAS1, BRIP1, and CtIP have distinct functions and serve as regulatory components of the initial steps of homologous recombination DNA damage repair","['Gijzen, Merel van']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-08-22T00:00:58Z,EN,['DNA double strand breaks; Homologous recombination; BRCA1 BRCT domain; ABRAXAS1; BRIP1; CtIP'],"Cancer, Stem Cells and Developmental Biology","DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) form a threat to genome integrity, as they are perceived to be the most dangerous type of DNA damage. Repairing DSBs correctly is important, and several mechanisms are in place to ensure this occurs in a precise and tightly regulated manner. Homologous recombination (HR) is one of the main pathways through which DSBs are repaired and uses a homologous sequence as a template for repair. Importantly, this makes HR an error-free process. Germline mutations in breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) are often detected in early-onset breast cancer patients. BRCA1 is known to play many roles in HR, but not all of its specific contributions have been elucidated. The BRCA1-BRCT domain has been reported to be essential for HR function of BRCA1. Three proteins are known to interact with one specific residue of the BRCA1-BRCT domain, namely ABRAXAS1, BRIP1, and CtIP. These three main interactions are each thought to contribute to different steps of the HR pathway and are also known to interact with other factors to form the BRCA1-A, BRCA1-B, and BRCA1-C complex, respectively. First of all, the interaction between BRCA1-BRCT and ABRAXAS1 is considered to decrease HR activity, as it tightly regulates the recruitment of components necessary for DNA end resection. Secondly, the BRCA1-CtIP interaction is reported to increase HR activity by enhancing CtIP function during the initiation of DNA end resection. Lastly, it remains to be determined whether the interaction between BRCA1-BRCT and BRIP1 increases HR activity or leaves it unaffected. Although not all individual interactions are deemed to be necessary, the versatile roles of the interactions with BRCA1-BRCT combined make it so that this domain plays a central part in the initiation of HR."

As a result, healthcare professionals might experience more potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs), which can lead to moral distress and even moral injury (MI). Since MI can have negative consequences for mental health, it is important to gain more knowledge about the extent to which healthcare professionals experience PMIEs and MI symptoms and to gain more insight in possible predicting factors, so that we can optimize treatment and prevention methods.
Design: A cross-sectional research design was used. The first goal was to examine to what extent healthcare professionals (N=72) are exposed to PMIEs and have MI as a consequence in comparison to a control group (N=75). The second goal was to examine if age, work experience, work at a COVID-19 department and moral reasoning style are predictors for the amount of PMIEs and MI symptoms experienced by healthcare professionals. 
Results: Healthcare professionals did not experience significantly more PMIEs and MI symptoms than the control group. The control group experienced significantly more MI symptoms than the healthcare professionals. Age, work experience, work at a COVID-19 department and moral reasoning style were not significant predictors for the amount of experienced PMIEs and the level of MI symptoms among healthcare professionals.
Discussion: Strengths of this research are the large sample size and the usage of a control group. A limitation of this study is the substantial length of the survey. A suggestion for future research is examining protective factors."

Insecure attachment reinforces maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, and in turn contributes to the decrease of well-being. Contrary, secure attachment leads to adaptive emotion regulation and better well-being. The focus of past literature on emotion regulation lays on intrapersonal strategies, while interpersonal strategies also play a role in the relationship between attachment and wellbeing. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate if Interpersonal Emotion Regulation (IER) mediates the relationship between attachment and well-being. In specific, it was examined whether anxious and avoidant attachment had different effects on wellbeing. It was hypothesized that avoidant attachment is negatively associated with well-being and that the relationship is mediated by IER, and that anxious attachment is negatively associated with well-being and that the relationship is mediated by IER. Therefore, an online survey was conducted with adults as participants. Scales assessing adult attachment, IER, social contexts of IER, and psychological well-being were used. The results showed no mediating effect of IER between anxious or avoidant attachment and well-being. Yet, a positive correlation between anxious attachment and well-being was found. Additionally, control variables of social contexts were positively associated with IER. The findings give insight into the mechanisms of IER, yet future investigations are needed, as their findings could provide important insights for therapeutic interventions."

This study examines the effects of humour in biographies and pick-up lines on online dating outcomes for young women on Tinder. Using an online experiment, 102 female participants were randomly exposed to eight Tinder profiles, including four with a humorous biography and four with a non-humorous biography. After each profile, participants were presented with a random pick-up line, also alternating between four humorous and four non-humorous options. This 2 x 2 within-subjects design allowed for the examination of different combinations of humorous and non-humorous biographies and pick-up lines. Surprisingly, a humorous biography alone did not yield significant positive outcomes, challenging the notion of humour as a guaranteed strategy for success. In contrast to previous research, humorous pick-up lines led to lower intentions to reply and lower long-term dating intentions. Moreover, combining a humorous biography and pick-up line did not significantly impact desired 
outcomes, suggesting that the interplay between humour in different aspects of one's online presence may not enhance overall success. The mediating role of perceived sense of humour was also not supported. These findings underscore the need for improved stimuli in online dating contexts and highlight the importance of considering factors beyond humour alone. The study acknowledges the ecological validity of the experiment and provides recommendations for future research, offering valuable insights into the complex nature of 
humour in the realm of online dating."

beliefs and confidence about carrying out school leader tasks could improve the motivation of 
teachers. Additionally, internal motivation turned out to be higher, which shows that teachers 
are more likely to be interested in internal motivators such as improving education and

Little is known about the effect of such protests, on the cause as a whole, and on other organisations that seek to promote action in less radical ways. This paper analyses the so-called radical flank effect, in which the appearance of more radical forms of protest increased support for less radical groups which advocate for the same cause. Simpson, Willer and Feinberg (2022) found this effect to be true with climate change protests., and also saw an increase in support for the cause as a whole, in a clinical setting where respondents were presented with groups that in reality did not exist. Instead, this research used data from Twitter to analyse the real life effect of a protest by the group Extinction Rebellion, which took place on 28 January 2023. During this protest, participants blockaded a section of the A12 Motorway which passes through the city centre of The Hague. The research examined the effect of the radical protest on four less radical advocacy groups: WWF/WNF, Urgenda, Milieudefensie and Greenpeace. Although a significant increase in mentions of the organisations was recorded, the share of positive messages was neither larger or smaller afterwards, which was not in line with the hypothesis of the radical flank effect."

This power shelters in the socially alienating practices that, according to Joshua David Bellin, make up the fabric of the fantasy tradition. In this thesis, I review Bellin's theory of alienating social practices, which involves framing marginalized groups as monstrous threats to the established social hierarchy, using Ebony Elizabeth Thomas' framework of the Dark Fantastic to provide a contemporary case study. As one of the biggest producers of fantasy today, my case comes from Marvel Studios’ Marvel Cinematic Universe, in the film Eternals, which is praised for being the most diverse entry into the MCU to date. However, despite its promising cast, a deconstruction of the film’s monsters reveals the film as a project of tokenism that uses an intersectionally diverse cast and crew members as a stand-in for structural change to genre conventions."

Techno-optimistic literature has explored the opportunities that this digitalization can provide. But when discussing digitalization, the human side of human-technology interaction that is intensified by digitalization should not be forgotten. This is where there is a knowledge gap that this thesis aims to fill. This study looks into these possible risks and side-effects of digitalization, of which technostress is an important part. Digital literacy is cemented as a way to cope with these side-effects. Further variables taken from literature are involved, such as age and education. 
Research questions: There are four research questions that help further the understanding of possible risks and side effects of digitalization. The first research question asks if there is a direct relationship between digitalization and technostress. After this the possible moderating roles of age, education and digital literacy are tested.
Methods: A quantitative analysis of secondary data was executed. The dataset used is the ‘Risks that matter survey’ from the OECD. The data is analyzed using IBM SPSS 28 and the PROCESS macro.
Results: It was found that individuals experience slightly but significantly less technostress in more digitalized working environments than in less digitalized working environments. Age and education moderated this relationship negatively. Digital literacy did not have a significantly moderating role.
Conclusions: Although a negative relationship between digitalization and technostress was found, individuals would experience even less technostress if they have a low age or high education when encountering highly digitalized working environments. This thesis is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the dataset, and further research will substantiate the findings."

"The Relationships Between Self-Leadership, Job Autonomy, Self-Efficacy and Innovative Work Behavior","['Kunz, Isabelle']","['Altink-van den Berg, Wieby']",2023-09-06T10:07:32Z,EN,['self-leadership; self-efficacy; innovative work behavior; job autonomy'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Innovative behavior in the workplace is becoming increasingly important to keep up with the market changes. To investigate potential antecedents of innovative work behavior, this study examined the mediation role of self-efficacy on the relationship between self-leadership and innovative work behavior. Also, the moderation role of job autonomy between self-leadership and self-efficacy was researched. Lacking one overarching theory, the social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) and the job characteristics model (Hackman & Oldham, 1976) are used as a theoretical basis in describing the proposed relationships. The sample consisted of 147 working adults from 23 nations, primarily from the Netherlands, who completed a crosssectional online survey. The findings revealed that an employee’s belief in their abilities, selfefficacy, mediates the relationship between self-leadership behavior and their tendency to show innovative work behavior ((β = .16, p < .05). This indicates that employees who exhibit self-leadership behaviors tend to have higher levels of self-efficacy, which in turn leads to more innovative work behavior. However, the moderation effect of job autonomy on the relationship between self-leadership and self-efficacy was not found to be significant. Similarly, no correlation between self-leadership behavior and job autonomy could be found. Job autonomy thus operates independently from self-leadership behavior on innovative work behavior. A post-hoc analysis revealed that job autonomy acts as a direct antecedent of innovative work behavior, being even a stronger predictor than self-efficacy. Therefore, organizations aiming to foster innovative work behavior of employees should encourage job autonomy and create supportive environments for self-efficacy development."
"Investigating the Relationship between Intrapreneurial Behaviour and Inclusive Leadership, and the Mediating Roles of Internal and External Networking","['Esen, Sarah']","['Altink-van den Berg, Wieby']",2023-09-06T10:07:56Z,EN,['intrapreneurial behaviour; inclusive leadership; internal networking; external networking'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Companies are increasingly looking for ways to increase their competitive advantage, for example by increasing organisational adaptability. One mean to achieve organisational adaptability is intrapreneurial behaviour (IB), which focuses on how employees increase organisational performance by acting as entrepreneurs within an organisation. This study investigated inclusive leadership (IL) as a possible antecedent of IB. IL is a leadership style aiming to increase belongingness and make all employees feel valued for their unique contributions. Additionally, it was explored whether internal networking (IN) and external networking (EN) partially mediate the relationship between IL and IB. All hypotheses of the study were built on existing studies and theory, specifically Social Network Theory and Social Capital Theory. The constructs were measured through an online cross-sectional survey completed by 126 adult respondents. The findings revealed a statistically significant (p < .05) correlation between IL and employees’ preference to exhibit IB. Parallel mediation analysis indicated that IN partially mediates the relationship between IL and IB in the presence of EN. Future research is suggested to explore factors promoting or inhibiting IL, 
and should continue exploring the extent to which IN and EN differ. Practical implications are that organisations aiming to increase employees’ IB should promote IL, such as by providing trainings in IL. Organisations are advised to encourage IN and EN, such as through providing opportunities to network, to stimulate employees’ IB."
A study examining the effects of personality on organisational citizenship behaviour and the mediating role of leader-member exchange,"['Verwer, Roderick']","['Vermue, M.']",2023-09-06T10:07:54Z,EN,"['Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Agreeableness, leader-member exchange, organisational citizenship behaviour, HEXACO']","Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB) brings many benefits for both the organisation as for the employees. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate which aspects are related to OCB. This study examined whether a possible relation between personality and organisational citizenship behaviour was mediated by leader-member exchange (LMX). 73 participants, all employees above 18 years old and with a supervisor, completed a subset version of the HEXACO-60 Self-report Scale, the LMX-7 questionnaire and the OCBC-10 survey to measure levels of Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Agreeableness, LMX and OCB. As all variables had an altruistic character, it was expected that all three personality domains would be positively related to LMX and OCB, except for Emotionality. In addition, it was predicted that LMX would mediate the relation between Honesty-Humility and Agreeableness with OCB. No significant results were found between the HEXACO domains and LMX and OCB, despite some earlier findings of literature. A significant effect was found for the control variable age, which meant that OCB levels got higher when age increased. But again, no significant effect was found for the HEXACO domains when the youngest group was left out. A possible explanation for these results may lie in the fact that current young employees have a high career mobility, which makes them switch jobs more often and possibly affects their levels of LMX and OCB. In future studies, it would be interesting to investigate whether there is a relation between high career mobility and LMX and OCB."
Influence of economic and political factors on low-carbon electricity production in the context of EU energy policy,"['Ciszewski, Piotr']","['Moreno, Kattia']",2023-09-06T10:07:34Z,EN,['energy transition; energy policy; economic inequality; national wealth; democracy; European Union'],Economic Policy,"Various studies suggest that economic and political factors may influence energy transition across countries. This paper investigates relationships between those factors and low-carbon electricity production, which implicitly represents an energy policy of a government. A certain innovation in this study is the use of an additional model incorporating natural gas among other low-carbon energy sources. Despite the present literature is not covering it, this is in line with the current policy practice, and therefore it is worth to be examined. An analysis of the recent studies imply that factors like national wealth, economic inequality and the state of democracy in particular countries may affect the energy policy. This paper focuses on exploring these potential relationships across the member states of the European Union and then discussing it within the specific context of EU regulatory framework related to the energy policy. The research question this paper is aiming to answer is as follows: Do national wealth, income inequality and state of democracy have an influence on the share of lowcarbon energy sources in electricity production across EU countries faced with EU climate policy? The study uses panel data regression analysis as a main component of the methodology. Conclusions derived from the research suggest that from the factors discussed, only national wealth is the one that affect the energy transition process in the EU countries. This finding may be useful in the process of designing the energy policies. Better understanding of the matter regarding the differences between the EU countries in the energy transition can help to mitigate uneven peace of this process."
"Assessment of CO2 sequestration in saline formations in the Netherlands northern offshore:
Upper Cretaceous Chalk","['Alwagdani, Hala']","['Beekman, Fred']",2023-09-06T10:08:01Z,EN,"['Chalk, CCS']",Earth Structure and Dynamics,"The international energy agency has outlined that at least 15% of global emissions will be reduced through carbon capture and storage (Global CCS Institute 2022). Current studies and projects in the Netherlands are investigating the storage of CO2 in depleted gas fields, and as such all studies focus on storage in Permian and Triassic clastic reservoirs. Although the carbonates, specifically Chalk play, has been prolific source of hydrocarbon in the Norwegian, Danish, and British sectors of the North Sea, it has only been discovered in four fields in the Netherlands. This study is the first to address the potential for deep offshore storage in the Chalk group in the K and L blocks of the Dutch offshore sector. The aim to produce a general assessment for the Chalk group’s distribution, development, and quality of the main parameters that impact CO2 injectivity and retention. The study focuses on L-K blocks in the northern offshore and utilizes a 3D survey with several well penetration that encountered, logged, and marked biostratigraphic intervals within the Chalk. The study demonstrated a workflow to evaluate and assess the Chalk utilizing seismic interpretation and attributes extraction. As a product, a general guideline was produced for the exploration of subsurface potential in the Chalk. Furthermore, the two most promising prospects within the survey were evaluated representing the two types of depositional Chalk (autochthonous and allochthonous). Autochthonous prospect F is analogous to the proven Chalk fields discovered in the Netherlands while allochthonous Prospect G is analogous to reservoirs in the UK sector. Both prospects at this stage are risky due to the lack of well data and adequate research on the Chalk to constrain the observation made, with an added risk to allochthonous prospect attributed to it not being encountered in the Dutch offshore before. To de-risk these prospects, future work was highlighted including building a detailed intra-Chalk interpretation to isolate and map seismically the proven reservoir intervals within the Chalk (Danian and Maastrichtian). Also, a detailed tectono-stratigraphic study that evaluates the inversion events impacting reservoir development. As Chalk is primarily discovered via geophysical methods, reprocessing the seismic for Chalk exploration and conducting seismic inversion to translate and quantify the geophysical parameters obtained of the seismic anomalies to reservoir character models would be key."

A case study of public universities in the Netherlands","['Tsakiri, Martha']","['Knies, Eva']",2023-09-07T01:01:37Z,EN,"['job insecurity, incentives / willingness to train and develop, employees, public Dutch universities, the Netherlands, fixed-term / permanent contracts, in-role performance, training and development programs / COR theory']",Strategisch Human Resource Management,"Research aim: Flexible employment with temporary contracts is a general characteristic in the Netherlands, while the current labor market is affected by staff shortages. Dutch universities are frontrunners when it comes to temporary contracts; from 2003-2020 the number of temporary contracts doubled. This high percentage of temporary workers and the staff shortages are causing a tension in the employment relations. Temporary workers change jobs more easily and, therefore, universities employees are considered at risk to change work environment, especially since the staff shortages increase the opportunities in the labor market.
Generally, job insecurity impacts
Therefore, this study examines the relationship between job insecurity due to the provision of fixed-term contracts, and in-role performance, and job insecurity and employees’ incentives for training; whether job insecurity will push them to participate in sector-specific learning and development programs.
Relevance: The inconsistent research on the impact of job insecurity on in-role performance, as well as the scarce evidence about employees’ willingness to follow sector-specific trainings in uncertain environments dictate that more exploration on the matter is needed. Furthermore, there is a social relevance related to keeping a high educational level in society, while universities and workers will have a clear idea and an arrow in their quiver to substantiate their bargain of providing permanent contracts to more employees.
Study method: Quantitative research with web-based survey prepared in Qualtrics and analyzed in Stata. Linear regression models were used, and mediation was tested with Stata’s mediation option.
Study findings: Job insecurity is negatively related to in-role performance and the following and willingness to follow job-related trainings, in the context of Dutch universities. Furthermore, the following and the willingness to follow job-related trainings positively relates to better in-role performance. Lastly, the following of job-related trainings like the BKO mediates the relationship between job insecurity and in-role performance.
Future research: Explore if the possibility to obtain a permanent contract will alter the results and the effects on psychological and physical well-being. Regarding the research about Dutch universities, researchers could test whether the position plays a significant role in determining whether employees will follow job-related trainings. Also, examine if employees will be more willing to follow trainings that will enhance their general skills."
De invloed van transparantie,"['Frenken, Frederique']","['Winnubst, Madelinde']",2023-09-07T01:01:49Z,NL,"['Wet open overheid, transparantie, vertrouwen, betrouwbaarheid, Woo, betrouwbare overheid, vertrouwen in overheid, transparante overheid, Woo-verzoek']","Communicatie, beleid en management","Op 1 mei 2022 is de Wet open overheid (Woo) in werking getreden. Een wet met als doel het nog transparanter maken van de overheid in het belang van openbaarheid van publieke informatie (Rijksoverheid, 2021a). Transparantie en de mate van betrouwbaarheid van de overheid die burgers ervaren zijn met elkaar verweven. Op dit moment blijkt uit onderzoeken van Ipsos (2022), NOS (2022) en het Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau (2022) dat er geen sprake is van een overheid die vertrouwen wekt bij een meerderheid van de burgers. Het afnemen van het vertrouwen van de burgers in de overheid kan een bedreiging zijn voor de democratische rechtsstaat. Burgers zijn minder geneigd deel te nemen aan democratische processen en worden mede daardoor beperkt in de mogelijkheden om invloed uit te oefenen op de politieke besluitvorming. Dit kan leiden tot een verminderde vertegenwoordiging van de belangen van burgers. In het opzicht van het functioneren van een democratische rechtstaat is het relevant om onderzoek te doen naar het vertrouwen in de overheid en de betrouwbaarheid van de overheid. Naast de afname van het vertrouwen van burgers in de overheid bestaat er in de literatuur onduidelijkheid over de relatie tussen een transparante overheid en een betrouwbare overheid. Enkele wetenschappers bevestigen dat transparantie een positieve bijdrage levert aan het vertrouwen in de overheid van burgers (Bouwman et al., 2020; De Vries et al., 2019; Mabillard, 2022; Scholtes, 2012), andere wetenschappers ontkrachten juist dat transparantie een directe relatie heeft met het voor burgers vergroten van vertrouwen in en de betrouwbaarheid van de overheid (Grimmelijkhuijsen, 2012; Jonkers, 2013; Löfstedt & Way, 2014; Skogan, 2007).
Dit onderzoek tracht kennis op te doen over deze relatie en omdat de Woo niet eerder als uitgangspunt is genomen in onderzoek naar deze relatie luidt de onderzoeksvraag van dit kwalitatieve onderzoek als volgt: Wat is de relatie tussen een transparante overheid en een betrouwbare overheid vanuit het perspectief van burgers, onderzoeksjournalisten, vertegenwoordigers van stichtingen en ambtenaren die gebruik maken van de Wet open overheid? Om antwoord te kunnen geven op de onderzoeksvraag is er in dit onderzoek een literatuurstudie gedaan en zijn er semigestructureerde interviews afgenomen. In de literatuurstudie staan de concepten vertrouwen, betrouwbaarheid en transparantie centraal. De interviews zijn afgenomen bij zes burgers, zeven onderzoeksjournalisten, twee vertegenwoordigers van stichtingen die gericht zijn op rechtsbescherming en het recht op openbaarmaking en vier ambtenaren die allemaal één of meerdere Woo-verzoeken hebben ingediend. Deze onderzoeksgroepen zijn geselecteerd op basis van data over Woo-verzoekers verkregen van vijftien willekeurige overheden die onder de Woo vallen. Met de respondenten wordt individueel in gesprek gegaan over de concepten vertrouwen, betrouwbaarheid en transparantie, welke aspecten zij van belang achten bij deze concepten en de ervaringen die zij hebben met de Woo en de overheid.
Uit dit onderzoek zijn verschillende resultaten voortgekomen. Uit het onderzoek komt naar voren dat transparantie van de overheid bijdraagt aan de betrouwbaarheid van de overheid. Het bieden van meer transparantie zorgt voor burgers voor een betrouwbare overheid en vertrouwen in de overheid. De kennis en informatie die door middel van transparantie van de overheid gedeeld worden, dienen daarvoor feitelijk, volledig en toegankelijk te zijn."
Leren van City Deals: Hoe succesvol beleid wordt gevormd door te experimenteren in verbinding,"['Vermeulen, Eva']","[""Hart, Paul 't""]",2023-09-07T01:01:45Z,NL,['Succesonderzoek; interbestuurlijk samenwerken; innovatieve overheid.'],Publiek management,"Dit onderzoek beoogt te achterhalen in hoeverre City Deals als interbestuurlijke werkwijze een succes zijn, wat het succes ervan verklaart en wat we kunnen leren van voorbeelden van deze werkwijze. Het onderzoeksdesign betreft een kwalitatief onderzoek met een vergelijkende casusanalyse. Een City Deal is een samenwerkingsvorm waarin gemeentes, provincies, kennisinstellingen, bedrijven, en maatschappelijke partijen samen met de Rijksoverheid aan nieuwe, innovatieve oplossingen werken voor uiteenlopende, complexe vraagstukken. City Deals maken onderdeel uit van het programma Agenda Stad, dat valt onder het Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken & Koninkrijksrelaties.

Om tot een casusselectie te komen, wordt een quick scan gedaan van potentieel succesvolle City Deals aan de hand van het trechtermodel. Het trechtermodel maakt het mogelijk om op een praktische en valide manier succesvol geacht bestuur te beoordelen. Hieruit volgt dat de City Deal Inclusieve Stad en Zicht op Ondermijning geschikte cases zijn om verder te evalueren.

Vervolgens worden de City Deals nader geëvalueerd met behulp van het PPPE-model. Dit model beoordeelt beleid aan de hand van vier dimensies van succesvol openbaar bestuur: programmatisch succes, procesmatig succes, politiek succes en duurzaamheid van succes. De resultaten van deze deep dive tonen aan dat beide City Deals redelijk tot zeer succesvol te noemen zijn op alle dimensies. De City Deal Inclusieve Stad kreeg het voor elkaar om een beweging in gang te zetten bij overheden en uitvoeringsinstanties om beter maatwerk in het sociaal domein te leveren. Zicht op Ondermijning heeft een dashboard gecreëerd dat inzicht verschaft in fenomenen van ondermijnende criminaliteit op gemeentelijk en wijkniveau.
Al met al komt Inclusieve Stad iets positiever uit de beoordeling, aangezien de baten van het succes van Zicht op Ondermijning niet evenredig verdeeld zijn en het proces daar in eerste instantie moeizaam verliep. Beide City Deals scoren relatief gezien wat lager op de politieke dimensie vanwege weerstand in de beginfase en desinteresse vanuit de landelijke en lokale politiek. Zowel Zicht op Ondermijning als Inclusieve Stad zijn een duurzaam succes: de aanpakken zijn structureel geborgd en blijven doorontwikkelen. De deals uit de casusselectie worden in dit onderzoek afgezet tegen de gehele populatie aan City Deals.

De derde stap van dit onderzoek richt zich op het verklaren van het succes. De resultaten tonen aan dat verschillende factoren ten grondslag liggen aan het succes van de City Deals. Brede steun van stakeholders, timing en leiderschap van ‘beleidsentrepeneurs’ verklaren het succes van deals in de kwartiermakers- en opschalingsfase. In de uitvoeringsfase van City Deals zijn ook experimenteerruimte, een bottom-up werkwijze, live bijeenkomsten, concrete resultaten en creatieve werkvormen verklarende succesfactoren. Weer andere factoren zoals een kleine koplopersgroep en goede onderlinge sociale relaties verklaren een succesvolle samenwerking binnen de City Deal. Tot slot vertaalt dit onderzoek de resultaten naar aanbevelingen voor Agenda Stad en nauw betrokkenen bij City Deals."
Japanse moderne kunst Sosaku hanga: kansen voor een mondiaal verhaal,"['Boskma, Janke']","['Rossem, Patrick van']",2023-09-07T01:01:47Z,NL,['Globalisering; Modernisme; Japan; Japanse moderne prentkunst; Sōsaku hanga; schenking Rijksmuseum; Elise Wessels; multiple modernities; kunst van de contactzone; transculturele contacten; Japonisme; Reverse Japonism; modernistische kunstvorm'],Kunstgeschiedenis,"""In deze actuele scriptie wordt onderzocht hoe de lang miskende en ook onbekende Japanse prentkunst Sōsaku hanga begrepen kan worden vanuit theorieën rond globalisering. De directe aanleiding is een belangrijke schenking van Elise Wessels aan het Rijksmuseum, maar de studie is hoofdzakelijk theoretisch, historisch en kunsthistorisch van aard. De inleiding legitimeert het onderzoek en stelt als probleem dat het modernisme in de context van de beeldende kunst lang is begrepen als een reeks artistieke strategieën voortgebracht door de westerse sociale moderniteit. Toegelicht wordt dat er ook wisselwerking bestond die veel complexer van aard was. De concepten ‘kunst van de contact zone’ en ‘multiple modernities’ worden gebruikt om Sōsaku hanga als een van de vele modernistische kunstvormen naar voren te schuiven. De hoofdvraag wordt beantwoord met geëngageerde bewijsvoering, gegrond in de Japanse geschiedenis en kunsthistorische kennis over de transculturele contacten tussen oost en west. Hoofdvraag is: Wat betekenen de theoretische concepten ‘kunst van de contact zone’ en ‘multiple modernities’ concreet voor het mondiale perspectief op Sōsaku hanga? Deelvragen zijn: 1. Wat is Sōsaku hanga? 2. Wat houden de theorieën over ‘kunst van de contact zone’ en ‘multiple modernities’ in, met name binnen de relatie tussen Japan en het westen? 3. Wat houden de theorieën over ‘kunst van de contact zone’ en ‘multiple modernities’ in, met name voor Sōsaku hanga?
Sōsaku hanga is een bijzonder voorbeeld van artistieke uitwisseling, die ontstond na de openstelling van Japan, toen kunstenaars in contact kwamen met het Westerse Japonisme en deze kunstenaars de westerse impulsen transformeerden in hun prentkunst.  Het onderzoek beoogt een kunstvorm die meer aandacht verdient naar voren te schuiven als een boeiende en hybride vorm van culturele uitwisseling. Het decentraliseert en relativeert het eurocentrisch denken en het denken in tegengestelden."""

inzichten vanuit de psychologie toegepast in de vorm van moral licensing.

Methode: Er is in kwalitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd met een exploratieve onderzoeksbenadering. In
totaal zijn er 21 semi-gestructureerde interviews afgenomen met hybride werkende universitair
(hoofd)docenten aan de Universiteit Utrecht.

Resultaten: Uit de resultaten van dit onderzoek blijkt universitair (hoofd)docenten wegens
verschillende redenen kiezen voor een andere werkomgeving, zoals de werkzaamheden, het contact met
collega’s en de voorzieningen op de locaties. Deze verschillende werkomgevingen hebben ieder een
andere invloed op de prestatie van de respondenten, wanneer dit wordt vergeleken met de componenten
van het TRIPLE-model van de Universiteit Utrecht. Uiteindelijk blijken factoren zoals de aanwezigheid
van collega’s en een mindere verstoring in de werk-privébalans te zorgen voor een hogere mate van
prestatie in de traditionele werkomgeving. Factoren zoals minder afleiding van collega’s en de
flexibiliteit van een werknemer, zorgen voor een hogere mate van prestatie in de niet-traditionele
werkomgeving. Een factor die zorgt voor een wisselende mate van prestatie op beide werkomgevingen
is de disposities van de werknemers.

Conclusie: Factoren binnen de organisatie- en omgevingsgerelateerde kenmerken, werkgerelateerde
kenmerken en werknemersgerelateerde kenmerken kunnen worden gebruikt om te verklaren waarom
werknemers in het hoger onderwijs een inconsistente mate van werknemersprestatie vertonen tijdens
het hybride werken. Daarnaast speelt moral licensing gedrag ook bij sommige werknemers een rol bij
de verklaring waarom sommige werknemers een lagere mate van prestatie vertonen tijdens het hybride

Putting Work on Hold: The Impact of Team-Level Agreements on Telepressure and Psychological Detachment Among Nurses,"['Jansink, Janneke']","['Tummers, L.G.']",2023-09-07T01:01:40Z,EN,"['telepressure, psychological detachment, team-level agreements, nurses']",Publiek management,"Nurses are under strain. Telepressure, the urge to respond to work-related messages after working hours, exacerbates this. Nurses are contacted daily after working hours to fill in or shift schedules. As a result, nurses are constantly connected to their work and their team. This makes it difficult for them to psychologically detach. Previous studies on telepressure conclude with the recommendation to establish clear norms and agreements at the team level for sending and receiving work-related messages outside working hours. However, this has not been systematically studied. This study examines if team-level agreements indeed have an impact on the level of telepressure and psychological detachment among nurses. A survey (n=142) and qualitative focus groups indicate that team-level agreements are negatively associated with telepressure and consequently, positively associated with psychological detachment. It is therefore crucial for nursing teams to convert unwritten rules and expectations into clear and explicit team-level agreements concerning work-related messages after the workday has ended."

To find a generalizable approach for addressing sustainability issues among subsidiaries entails complexity (Camarinha-Matos et al., 2008). Hence, the aim of this study was to understand and expand knowledge, in theory and practice, around the creation process of a cross-subsidiary collaborative network (CSCN) in diversified business groups (DBGs) to foster sustainable innovation (SI); using a sample of nine SME subsidiaries of a decentralized DBG in the Netherlands. THEORY Literature on open innovation effectiveness and empirical studies on CSCNs were reviewed, and a triple-bottom-line definition of sustainability was adopted. Regarding CSCNs, the influences of four effectiveness factors: holding company support, subsidiary-centric approach, nature of knowledge, and goal congruency, were explored. Concerning SI, it was theoretically expected from a CSCN to make a substantial contribution in subsidiaries’ understanding of the stakes and paths towards potential sustainable solutions to sustainability challenges (Camarinha-Matos, Afsarmanesh, et al., 2010). METHODS The study used an exploratory action research. This method encompassed theory-informed researcher interventions in the DBG; enabling an in-depth research of the case, in which all relevant stakeholders helped define the methodology as it unfolded. For this, an extensive set of qualitative data was collected for seven months through workshops, surveys, interviews, and participant feedback. The data was coded (mainly) deductively using the four factors as the analytical lens, and examined using thematic analysis. RESULTS & DISCUSSION The individual influences of the four factors were proven to be deeply intertwined, and all factors’ influence in effectively fostering SI seemed to be moderated by the level of subsidiary (and participants) motivation and curiosity. Aspects found essential when creating a CSCN were the support and engagement of the holding company, remaining sensitive and responsive to subsidiaries’ express needs for collaboration, and having collective clarity on the network’s goals. Evidence also showed that diversity in employee and firm knowledge fostered collaborative innovation and nurtured innovation capabilities. The CSCN also empowered subsidiaries to discover a share of common sustainability issues, which increased their motivation and sense of urgency. CONCLUSION This study made both theoretical and practical contributions for DBGs to apply collaboration for SI. The data offered robust answers substantiated in empirical evidence and stakeholder input, advancing the fields of collaborative networks and of applied action research."

a combined effect-directed strategy to assess environmental exposure and health impacts","['Ferrario, Adele']","['Hoek, Gerard']",2023-09-19T00:00:50Z,EN,['Plastic food packaging; chemical mixtures’ migration; bioassays; non-targeted analysis; effect-directed methods'],Toxicology and Environmental Health,"Plastic packaging is a dominant sector within the plastic industry, primarily finding applications in food packaging. Chemical substances are intentionally incorporated into plastic food packaging to impart specific product characteristics or streamline production in compliance with EU No 10/2011. However, unintentional substances can also be present as contaminants or transformation products. These substances may leach from the packaging, particularly during reuse, recycling, exposure to elevated temperatures and ultraviolet radiation (UV) or microwaving, contaminating the stored food and beverages and the surrounding environment, including air, water, soil, and sediments. Some authorised chemicals that can migrate from plastic food packaging, such as bisphenol A and phthalate esters, are already recognised for their high toxicological risk. The core issue lies in the limited comprehension of these mixtures' chemical composition, exposure levels, and toxicological properties, which raises substantial concerns about potential human health risks. Our research investigates these aspects by applying a combined effect-directed methodology. Migration experiments will be conducted under varying conditions and environmental sampling at critical locations. One of our key objectives is to unveil the essential factors influencing the migration of chemicals from plastic food  packaging and to illuminate the types of packaging and conditions most susceptible to this phenomenon. In vitro assays will be  implied to account for ingestion and inhalation exposure routes and assess hazard endpoints such as genotoxicity and endocrine disruption. This approach will enable us to prioritise mixtures of concern for subsequent chemical analysis. To uncover the  compositions of these mixtures, these will be attentively identified by employing non-target screening alongside computational  predictions for identifying unknown signals. By combining chemical analysis, in vitro approach, chemical analysis and predictive tools, this project aims to construct a comprehensive framework for effect-directed evaluation of plastic food packaging-associated chemicals' mixtures."
Measuring maturity in corporate Circular Business Models,"['Ferguson Perez, Andrea']","['Kirchherr, Julian']",2023-09-19T00:00:53Z,EN,['CBM implementation; maturity models; dynamic capabilities; Circular Economy; corporate capabilities'],Sustainable Development,"Circular economy (CE) remains underdeveloped although it is gaining momentum as an alternative to the current environmentally damaging linear economy. Organizations, under socio-technical regimes, are currently trapped in path dependencies towards linear production processes. However, they can become enablers of a transition towards a CE by implementing circular strategies in their business model (CBM) such as cycling, extending, intensifying or dematerializing their value chains. In any case, there is a lack of guidance on the know-how required to effectively implement CBMs in organizations and on how to assess their progress.
The present study aims to develop a maturity model for CBM implementation that takes into account the dynamic process of innovation, while providing a diagnostic and a benchmarking tool for organizations and policymakers. To build such a model, the following research question was investigated: How can organizations measure their maturity in terms of CBM implementation? Research for the study followed a deductive design, conducting an integrative literature review to identify 14 organizational capabilities required for CBM implementation, according to recent research on Dynamic Capabilities applied to CBMI. Such capabilities are described according to four levels of maturity, setting best practices at the highest level. The maturity model also contains a grading mechanism that provides organizations with an overall grade, as well as a grade per stage of implementation to guide them into identifying areas for improvement. Such a preliminary model was then tested with two case studies from the denim industry, following a maximum variation sample approach and refined with their feedback as a way to validate the model and improve its universality. 
Compared to existing theory on CBM implementation where practices are cataloged, the present study not only gathers more recent practices, but also introduces an unprecedented assessment mechanism that allows organizations to evaluate their current CBM implementation status and to plan their future steps, for each level of maturity.  The maturity model developed in the present study provides guidance on CBM implementation that policy makers, academics, and practitioners have been requesting, thus enabling a wider discussion on CE adoption."
Implementing and upscaling the “Improved Drainage System”,"['Haas, Sterre de']","['Wassen, Martin']",2023-09-19T00:01:02Z,EN,"['Flexible water level; STOWA Water Balance; Internal autonomous salinisation; Sustainability, Deep polder area; Haarlemmermeer']",Water Science and Management,"This master thesis explores the implementation of the Improved Drainage System (VDS) in the 
agricultural area of the Haarlemmermeer polder, aiming to reduce freshwater demand and mitigate 
waterlogging risks while maintaining suitable water quality and salinity for agricultural functions. The 
study investigates the effect of VDS compared to traditional water management in response to climate 
change and autonomous salinisation.

The traditional approach in water management focuses on meeting societal demands for agriculture, 
involving rapid drainage of excess water, and flushing of brackish surface water resulting from the 
permanent saline seepage flux. VDS, on the other hand, applies a flexible surface water level within 
specific margins and reduces the need for inlet water by eliminating the flushing of the polder.

The STOWA model, created by “Stichting Toegepast Onderzoek Waterbeheer” in collaboration with 
Witteveen & Bos and Waternet, is a calculation tool in Excel that utilizes a box model of the Water 
Balance. The STOWA model was utilized for this study, this tool proved suitable for studying the effects 
of the implementation of VDS on the water system regarding the water level, water demand, and water 
saliniy. However, the STOWA model is inadequate for the modeling of the water quality, because the 
STOWA model is a point-based model and is incapable of employing the spatial and temporal 
variability. The large parameter variation and uncertainties make STOWA unsuitable for making robust 
decisions regarding VDS implementation.

The research findings indicate that VDS reduces freshwater demand when comparing to the traditional 
management without flushing, resulting in lower inlet water requirements. Additionally, the results 
showed that without irrigation, no inlet water is needed to maintain the minimum set levels in the water 
system. Furthermore, the traditional management approach in the polder demonstrated its capability to 
handle anticipated extreme rainstorm events, suggesting that adaptive measures are not required to 
mitigate waterlogging risks caused by climate change. In contrast, internal autonomous salinisation does 
require measures to prevent salinisation of the surface water. 

Implementing VDS consistently leads to higher surface water salinity compared to traditional 
management, contradicting the hypothesis that rainwater capture in VDS management would have a 
freshening effect. The findings from upscaling VDS to the entire Haarlemmermeer polder indicate that 
VDS can be applied in specific areas of the polder while maintaining agricultural functionality, 
depending on the flux and salinity of the phreatic seepage and the presence of seepage boils. 
Consequently, determining the freshwater-saltwater interface is crucial for assessing the suitability of 
an area for the implementation of VDS."
"Towards Performance Comparability:
An Implementation of New Metrics into the ASReview Active Learning Screening

learning methods in reducing manual screening workload in systematic literature reviews. The 
second most used performance metric in this field is Work Saved Over Sampling (WSS), which 
aims to measure the reduction in screening effort. A drawback of the WSS metric, however, is its
sensitivity to dataset class imbalance, which leads to biased performance comparisons across 
datasets. In this light, two main features were added to the state-of-the-art and open-source
simulation software ASReview, which offers a unique infrastructure for testing different AL model 
and feature extractor combinations across datasets. First, the confusion matrix was implemented 
into the ASReview software, which was subsequently used to implement the True Negative Rate 
(TNR), shown to be equal to the normalized WSS (Kusa et al., 2023). These advancements, 
previously absent in the software, represent a step towards achieving a more comprehensive 
understanding of AL performance in SLR tasks. Specifically, the adjustment for class imbalance
facilitates further study of data characteristics related to model performance beyond class 
imbalance. This enhanced understanding enables researchers and practitioners to make more 
informed decisions in selecting and fine tuning AL models, ultimately leading to more efficient 
screening in practice."

Daarnaast kan het bespreken van behandelwensen leiden tot weloverwogen behandelkeuzes. Deze gezamenlijke besluitvorming tussen artsen en patiënten is belangrijk en gebaseerd op klinisch bewijs en persoonlijke waarden. Artsen en patiënten vinden gezamenlijke besluitvorming lastig vanwege verschillende redenen. De introductie van behandelgrenzen in consulten is een complex vraagstuk dat communicatieve en geneeskundige aspecten omvat. Het onderzoek naar dit onderwerp is beperkt, maar kan bijdragen aan een beter begrip en implementatie van gezamenlijke besluitvorming en daarmee de zorg verbeteren. Dit onderzoek maakt gebruik van een bestaande dataset van video-opnames van zorgbeslissingsgesprekken op de polikliniek interne geneeskunde van het UMCU. De opnames bevatten consulten waarin behandelwensen en -grenzen tussen arts en patiënt worden besproken. De gegevens zijn afkomstig van 150 video-opnames tussen oktober 2018 en februari 2020. Conversatieanalyse wordt gebruikt om de interactie tussen arts en patiënt te analyseren en te begrijpen. Het onderzoek maakt gebruik van een interdisciplinaire benadering, waarbij de disciplines geneeskunde en communicatiewetenschappen worden gecombineerd om tot nieuwe inzichten te komen.
De analyse geeft inzicht in hoe artsen het gesprek over behandelgrenzen initiëren. Dit gebeurt op verschillende manieren: (1) het geven van opsommingen, (2) het toevoegen van ‘nog één ding’, (3) verantwoording via het onderzoek, (4) introductie als een ‘gekke’ vraag. Artsen benadrukken het belang van het onderwerp en vragen naar de gedachten van de patiënt. Het laatste deel van de analyse laat zien hoe een patiënt het onderwerp introduceert, en de arts reageert met informatie en hulp bij besluitvorming. Het belang van open en eerlijke communicatie over behandelbeperkingen en de wensen van de patiënt wordt benadrukt. Het onderwerp van behandelbeperkingen is gevoelig, omdat het gaat over het einde van het leven en de mogelijkheid om niet te behandelen. Artsen gebruiken verschillende technieken om het onderwerp in te leiden, zoals het gebruik van opsommingen, de uiting ‘nog één ding’ en het verwijzen naar onderzoek. Ze kunnen ook het onderwerp introduceren door het een ‘gekke’ vraag te noemen en daarmee het gesprek luchtig te openen. Het is belangrijk dat artsen deze gevoelige onderwerpen op een neutrale en begrijpelijke manier bespreken, waarbij een directe vraag en ruimte voor de patiënt om te reageren essentieel zijn. Te lange inleidingen kunnen de participatie van de patiënt beperken en de autonomie bij het antwoorden bemoeilijken."
Designing a combined Activation-Induced Marker and Intracellular Cytokine assay for comprehensive characterization of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected children and adults,"['Dogariu, Yvonne']","['Nijhuis, Monique']",2023-10-09T23:00:59Z,EN,['SARS-CoV-2; Activation Induced Marker assay; hybrid AIM+ICS assay; children; T cells;'],Infection and Immunity,"The emergence of the novel coronavirus has prompted tremendous research effort towards the understanding of protective immune mechanisms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Broadly speaking, while multiple branches of the human immune system contribute to protection against SARS-CoV-2, most knowledge to date concerns the behavior of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. This understanding has come to show that while antibodies generated post-infection are well-protective, they naturally diminish over time, and therefore recovered individuals are often left with insufficient levels of antibodies to altogether prevent re-infection. Thus, scientists have turned their attention towards other immune cell subsets which are better suited to contribute to protection against severe infection outcomes (that is, clinical protection) rather than altogether prevent reinfection. In this regard, T cells are a highly diverse immune cell subset with various roles in antiviral immunity; and while T cells are more difficult to study, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells could offer the possibility of long-lasting protection following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and could even provide some degree of protection against emerging viral variants. Consequently, establishing the quantity and quality of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells needed for clinical protection, as well as which disease settings (e.g., disease severities, patient groups, etc.) lead to the generation of these T cells have become important research avenues in recent times.
In this context, early studies throughout the pandemic have relied on more traditional techniques of identifying SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, with the important drawback of a less precise assessment of the quantity of T cell responses. More recently, the technique called the Activation-Induced Marker (in short, “AIM”) assay has been preferentially used because it allows a more accurate identification of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. However, this assay is rather laborious and costly, and offers only information regarding the phenotype (that is, the surface characteristics of cells) but not of the functional properties of the T cells analyzed. Therefore, in this study we used a hybrid version of the AIM assay, named in short “AIM+ICS”, which allows the simultaneous assessment of both phenotype and function of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, thus allowing us to gain better insight into this immune cell subset.
Importantly, we optimized and applied this technique to allow the in-depth characterization of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells of not only adult but also pediatric samples. Interestingly, children appear to be better protected against severe infection outcomes compared to adults. Still, the study of pediatric immune responses has so far been hindered by the limited blood volumes that can be obtained, which in turn allows relatively limited scientific insights to be obtained. In this context, our combined AIM+ICS assay is a very well-suited experimental technique to thoroughly analyze pediatric T cell responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, we inquired whether the quantity, quality, temporal development, or long-term maintenance of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are distinct in children with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to disease severity-matched adults. Thus, here we explored the link between SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and the superior clinical protection of children following SARS-CoV-2 infection."
Effect of HIF-1α expression on macrophage phenotype during infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"['Versnel, Anouk']","['Meyaard, Linde']",2023-10-08T23:00:56Z,EN,['Tuberculosis; HIF-1a; macrophage phenotype; flow cytometry'],Infection and Immunity,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), presents a major global health challenge as antibiotic therapy is highly intensive and the occurrence of drug-resistant strains continues to increase. Therefore, there is a need for new adjunct therapies for TB. An interesting target for this is HIF-1α, a transcription factor that is involved in the cellular response towards hypoxia. Here, an in vitro model of human blood-derived macrophages infected with the avirulent mycobacterium strains Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) and H37Ra was used to study the effect of Mtb infection on the phenotype of macrophages, including polarization towards inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages, as well as how this is affected by HIF-1α modulation. Additionally, the method of flow cytometry to measure HIF-1α expression was evaluated. Uninfected macrophages displayed a highly dominant M2 phenotype, which became a mixed with slightly dominant M1 phenotype after infection with BCG and H37Ra. While this seems favorable for Mtb killing, inhibitory molecules PD-L1 and IDO were upregulated, which could counteract the positive effect of M1 polarization. Stabilization or blockade of HIF-1α did not affect M1/M2 polarization of BCG-infected macrophages. However, expression of IL-1β was upregulated after stabilization of HIF-1α, which seems favorable for Mtb killing. The effect of HIF-1α stabilization and blockade could not be clearly demonstrated when visualizing HIF-1α expression with flow cytometry, but parallel western blot experiments revealed that at least HIF-1α stabilization was successful. Western blot seemed to have a higher sensitivity to detect differences in HIF-1α expression and less subject to donor variation compared to flow cytometry. All in all, additional research is needed to optimize the currently used flow cytometry protocol for the detection of HIF-1α, as well as to further characterize the effect of HIF-1α modulation on macrophage phenotype in the context of Mtb infection."

Early diagnosis is crucial for timely treatment and fracture prevention. Bone mineral density (BMD) estimation is pivotal in this regard, with trabecular tissue providing key insights. Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) are the current clinical standards but come with several limitations. Spectral CT, a promising technology, overcomes these limitations by employing dual-energy techniques. It quantifies materials based on distinct attenuation properties at different energy levels. A three-material decomposition technique shows potential in dual-energy CT, enabling BMD quantification without a calibration phantom and addressing adipose tissue influence. This review explores the application of three-material decomposition in spectral CT for osteoporosis BMD assessment, evaluating existing techniques, strengths, and limitations, and offering insights into spectral CT’s potential in early diagnosis and osteoporosis management, outlining future directions, including technological advancements and improved BMD analysis using three-material decomposition in spectral CT."

Small wins, while individually modest, can collectively lead to significant transformation by deviating from established practices. The study focuses on how ""propelling mechanisms"" help small wins overcome institutional barriers, with a particular emphasis on ""institutional work"" as a means of agency in this process. The research involves an embedded case study of the Dutch textile industry's transition to higher R-strategies, revealing that normative and cultural barriers are prominent, and regulatory barriers play a smaller role. Successful activation of propelling mechanisms amplifies initiatives and enhances their ability to engage in institutional work effectively. The findings have implications for policy, suggesting that support for small wins, especially in areas like social innovation, can be vital for achieving transformative change. Small wins are particularly effective in addressing cultural and normative institutional dimensions, making them essential for a transition to a circular economy that encompasses both technological and social aspects of circularity."

This study, therefore, examined if task-selection accuracy would be dependent on choosing a task for yourself or choosing a task for someone else and subsequently, if that effect would be dependent on selfefficacy. 125 secondary education students participated in this experimental study. Participants followed a Self-Assessment and Task-Selection (SATS) training, afterwards rated their selfefficacy, and solved biology tasks which they chose for themselves and biology tasks they chose for someone else. Results showed that task-selection accuracy did depend on choosing for yourself or someone else with choosing a task for someone else having the highest task-selection accuracy.

While this is worrying 
as is, they are part of a growing industry of Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs), which 
become increasingly important in modern warfare. Meanwhile, the core regulations of armed conflict, 
International Humanitarian Law, falls short of providing clear mechanisms to address this issue and 
persecute their crimes. This thesis aims to explore how Wagner’s deployment in Mali is destabilising the 
International Rule of Law (IRoL) in Non-International Armed Conflict (NIAC). Based on a literature 
review on IRoL, I propose a working definition of IRoL in NIAC in two parts. The first component 
encompasses principles of procedural integrity. The second refers to the compliance with International 
Humanitarian Law (IHL). IHL is concluded to be essential in regulating armed conflict and is effectively 
universally binding. Hence, it is the basis for this working definition and the operationalisation for its 
application in the case context. Based on the said definition, I operationalise IRoL in NIAC as the 
protection of civilians from unnecessary harm and violence. After a brief overview of the conflict in Mali, 
I apply this definition to Wagner to analyse the extent to which they might act as undermining IRoL. 
Based on data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) between 01 September 
2021 and 31 July 2023, Violence against Civilians has increased drastically since Wagner’s deployment, 
and the group shows patterns of targeting specific, already marginalised, ethnic groups. Therefore, I 
conclude, Wagner's presence in Mali undermines IRoL in two ways: First, due to legal ambiguity 
concerning PMSCs in NIAC. Second, Wagner is actively targeting and harming civilians, thus violating 
the fundamental principles of IHL. For future discourse and research, I suggest two approaches. First, 
international partners ought to reevaluate the underlying reasons for involving Wagner in armed conflict
and re-evaluate their past and present approaches to military intervention. Second, in light of the broader 
movement towards the privatisation of warfare, IHL needs to clearly address the status and provisions of 
actors such as PMSCs in armed conflict."

Moutse Valley, located in the Sekhukhune district of Limpopo, presents an intriguing scenario where Ndlovu Care Group (NCG), an NGO, initially played a crucial role in bolstering healthcare services during the HIV epidemic. As HIV prevalence waned, the provision of NCG assistance shifted to private channels which were no longer free of charge. Research questions: This study seeks to explore the perceptions and utilisation patterns of public healthcare services among residents of Moutse Valley, Sekhukhune district, Limpopo, South Africa. Additionally, it aims to investigate the influence exerted by the presence of NCG on the perception of public healthcare services within this context. Methods: In semi-structured interviews, community members of Moutse Valley were engaged to discuss predisposing, enabling, and needs factors in line with the Andersen model of healthcare utilisation. Results: The study involved 31 participants who were all residents of Moutse Valley at the time of the study. Foremost among the barriers to healthcare utilisation were factors such as limited biomedical knowledge, preference for alternative healing methods, concerns about the quality of public healthcare, transportation issues, and financial constraints. Moreover, comparisons between publicly provided services and the privately funded healthcare by NCG were common, contributing to dissatisfaction with public services. Conclusion: This study sheds light on barriers to accessing public healthcare in Moutse Valley, uncovering quality of care, traditional practices, disease stigma, financial constraints, and transportation issues as key challenges. The presence of NCG's privately funded services has influenced dissatisfaction with public healthcare. Moreover, the Andersen model's application and adaptation underscores the influence of historical factors and highlights the role of NGOs in bridging healthcare gaps. While limitations exist, addressing these issues is imperative given rising disease burdens and healthcare challenges."

In deze thesis wordt onderzocht op welke denkvaardigheden en typen krachtige kennis een beroep wordt gedaan binnen het IB DP onderwijs. Door middel van analyse van IB DP leerdoelen, examens en een lesmethode wordt een beeld geschetst van de mate van hogere orde denken binnen de IB context. Bij de analyse is gebruik gemaakt van het Geography Task Classification Framework (Krause, Béneker & Van Tartwijk, 2021). Vervolgens zijn IB DP Geography docenten geïnterviewd om hun ervaringen naar verschillende denkvaardigheden in de dagelijkse lespraktijk in kaart te brengen. Deze resultaten zijn vervolgens vergeleken met eerder onderzoek naar de mate van hogere orde denkvaardigheden in de Nederlandse context.
Hoewel binnen de IB context in zowel de leerdoelen, examens als lesmethode meer hogere orde denkvaardigheden worden getoetst dan in de Nederlandse context, zijn er grote verschillen te zien tussen het beoogd en uitgevoerd curriculum. Hierbij is de mate van hogere orde denken binnen het beoogd curriculum beduidend groter dan het uitgevoerd curriculum. Daarnaast geven IB docenten aan het beoogd curriculum niet altijd te gebruiken in de dagelijkse lespraktijk en het als restrictief te ervaren. In conclusie kan worden gesteld dat het IB probeert hogere orde denkvaardigheden over te brengen op haar studenten, maar dit wordt niet altijd overgenomen in de praktijk, door de kloof tussen het beoogd en uitgevoerd curriculum."

As this waste breaks down, it becomes tiny particles called microplastics (MPs). These MPs can be found in our environment, including in our food and water, which might pose health risks.When we consume these MPs, they travel through our digestive system and can potentially be absorbed by cells in our small intestine. Once inside our bodies, they come into contact with cells in our immune system around the intestines. Scientists have conducted studies using artificial models to understand the risks associated with MP exposure. However, there is a debate about which MPs to use in these studies. Some researchers use clean lab-bought particles known as virgin MPs, but these might not accurately represent the MPs in our environment. To address this, some studies have altered MPs to mimic real-world conditions, like movement or exposure to UV light. Different types of plastic have distinct properties, so they react differently to these alterations. In this review, researchers investigated how altering MPs in the lab affects their impact on cells in the intestines and immune system. They examined the chemical properties that affect the alteration of plastic and reviewed articles that studied the effects of altered and unaltered MPs on these cell models. The findings suggested that weathering, or altering, MPs can lead to different toxic effects compared to unaltered MPs. However, due to variations in exposure conditions, alteration methods, and cell models used in the studies, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. Further large-scale and consistent research is needed, involving different types of plastic and alteration processes. This will help establish more reliable conclusions and increase our understanding of the effects of weathered MPs on our health."

Music listening deems to be an interesting approach for reducing such limitations, as several studies have suggested musical training as a tool to enhance various cognitive functions. Due to a significant lack of research in the field of autism, however, a literature review will not be sufficient for studying the effectiveness of music listening on overstimulation in adults with autism. Therefore, this thesis encompasses a combination of a literature review and survey research, including an experiment to test the effectiveness of different sound fragments on the levels of calmness and overstimulation. The experiment results suggest that, of all conditions (i.e., background noise, simple music, complex music, and music of choice), the ‘music of choice’ condition has yielded the most positive outcomes, implying a correlation between musical preference, calmness, and overstimulation. When looking into the optimal conditions for minimizing overstimulation in adults with an ASD, it appears that this cannot be predetermined, as this mainly depends on variable components (e.g., musical preference, level and cause of overstimulation, sensitivity to stimuli, emotional state of mind). Nevertheless, several patterns have been identified, indicating that listening to loud, familiar, and repetitive music may be beneficial for reducing overstimulation in adults with autism. Further research is essential in order to achieve optimal results."
r-PLBP: Temporal Logic for Reasoning about Safety and Rewards of Bounded Policies under Uncertainty,"['Lutz, Sterre']","['Doder, Dragan']",2023-10-05T23:00:50Z,EN,['temporal logic; bounded policies; agents; reinforcement learning; shielded reinforcement learning'],Artificial Intelligence,"Temporal logics can be used to reason about how environments change over time. When environments have an element of uncertainty, agents with the power to make decisions, or an opportunity for gaining rewards, reasoning about such factors requires a temporal logic with the vocabulary to address them. 

We propose rPLBP, a reward-based extension of Probabilistic Logic of Bounded Policies that can reason about the rewards gained by an agent in a probabilistic environment. This logic includes expressions to reason about rewards accumulated along a finite path, as well as the expected reward given a finite strategy (a sort of playbook describing which actions the agent will take for a finite number of future steps). We show that the model checking problem for rPLBP is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we prove that the satisfiability problem for rPLBP is in 2EXPSPACE. 

We explore applications of rPLBP in the field of safe reinforcement learning. In shielded learning, safety constraints are used to block unsafe actions during the learning phase of an agent. Unlike the temporal logics usually used for such constraints -- e.g. Linear Temporal Logic and Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic -- the logic rPLBP allows us to express to what extent safety guidelines may be relaxed based on expected reward."
Exploring the Physics and Emerging Clinical Applications of Quantitative Ultrasound in Oncology: A Comprehensive Review,"['Arregui García, Xabier']","['Deckers, Roel']",2023-10-04T23:01:01Z,EN,[],Medical Imaging,"Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) imaging aims at quantifying physical phenomena associated with the propagation of ultrasound in tissue, with the ultimate goal of determining the tissue microstructure. QUS techniques include attenuation evaluation, speed of sound evaluation, backscatter estimation, and envelope statistics. These techniques have been applied in multiple clinical applications such as liver steatosis, cervical ripening detection, bone properties assessment, and oncology. This study reviews the recent clinical applications of quantitative ultrasound with a special focus on oncology, as well as evaluates the current state of the implementation of QUS technology into clinical devices. The underlying physics of each quantitative ultrasound modality is explained in a comprehensive manner, and the aspects impeding the widespread clinical implementation of QUS are also investigated and discussed. Lastly, the potential of deep learning methods to enhance the accuracy, speed, and quality of quantitative ultrasound imaging is discussed."
The Tolerance Principle and the Orthographic-Phonological Mapping of Chinese Characters,"['Lin, Chenyang']","['Mulders, I.C.M.C.']",2023-10-04T23:00:59Z,EN,['Tolerance Principle; Chinese; generalization; orthography; psycholinguistics'],Linguistics,"The Tolerance Principle is a computational principle that posits a theoretical threshold for linguistic generalization.

This thesis tests if the Tolerance Principle can be applied to the learning of Chinese phono-semantic compounds, more specifically the orthographic-phonological mapping between phonetic radicals and pronunciations, by both Chinese and non-Chinese readers. The first experiment examines if the reading intuitions of Chinese readers seeing pseudo-characters are constrained by the Tolerance Principle, while the second experiment investigates if the acquisition of the orthographic-phonological mappings by non-Chinese readers is also conditioned by the Tolerance Principle. Results show that the Tolerance Principle does not predict the performance of Chinese readers, nor explain the acquisition of non-Chinese readers."

"The power of education: A qualitative study to the role of NGO education programs in the
empowerment of young women in La Paz, Bolivia","['Schalkwijk, Lara']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-09-30T00:01:23Z,EN,['women empowerment; NGO project; education'],International Development Studies,"Although female enrollment rates in higher education are increasing worldwide, there are groups that
stay behind. In the Bolivian context, socially and economically disadvantaged young women are still
at disadvantage to complete their schooling. This is where certain NGO education programs step in. In
this research the following question is central: How do NGO education programs like Helping Hands
support the empowerment process of young women in La Paz, Bolivia? Education is an important tool
in the process of empowerment. However, education alone is not enough to fully empower a woman.
Additionally, as gender relations are culturally specific and differ across contexts, it is important to
consider cultural contexts when looking at strategies to foster empowerment. As studies on the role of
NGO education projects for women empowerment are lacking, especially in the Bolivian context, this
study is empirically relevant. Additionally, it can be helpful for NGO projects to see what dimensions
are effective to support processes of empowerment. The research has been conducted in La Paz, the
administrative capital of Bolivia. Qualitative methods like conducting in-depth interviews and
conducting participant observation were used to gain understanding of the lived experience of the
participants.
 This study states that a holistic approach is needed to support the empowerment processes of
young women in La Paz, Bolivia. In this, four important dimensions of empowerment are presented.
These are 1) the economic dimension, 2) the health dimension, 3) the social dimension and 4) the
personal dimension. The study concludes by stating that NGO education programs are a great way to
bring individual change from a grassroots level. However, structural barriers are not necessarily
removed by these programs."
"How has the new-build gentrification of Dublin’s North Lotts Docklands affected the surrounding East Wall neighbourhood?
A multifaceted approach to measuring knock-on effects resulting from the new-build gentrification of the Dublin Docklands to a bordering neighbourhood.","['Caird Marren, Honor']","['Bolt, Gideon']",2023-09-30T00:01:12Z,EN,['new-build gentrification; docklands; regeneration impacts; financialisation; knock-on effects'],Urban and Economic Geography,"This thesis focuses on the new-build gentrification of Dublin's North Lotts Docklands and its knock-on effects on its bordering neighbourhood East Wall and its residents. The research considers whether the redevelopment has had socio-economic or physical changes in East Wall, if government planning policies or other financial processes have been involved in the process, and whether the long-term local residents perceive any impacts in their neighbourhood in the years during development. The successful regeneration of the North Lotts Dublin Docklands has continued further state-led planning policies, incentives and international investment in the adjacent neighbourhood. There has been different forms of buildings and tenancy taking place in the neighbourhood with the addition of high-density buildings and rental tenancies. Alongside this, there has been an increasing population growth that has resulted in an inward migration of different nationalities and mixed socio-economic groups. However, the focus of developing accommodation has resulted in pressure on East Wall's resources and services."

To implement multiverse modelling, four different
state of the art algorithms were employed, along with various tuned versions. The focus of the
project was on individual variable importance, although model performance was essential as
well.
The results indicated that all algorithms (except for the Random Forest) performed reasonably well after tuning, depending on the target variable. The Random Forest models exhibited
poor performance across all target variables and were excluded from the overall variable importance analysis. Three significant findings emerged from the study. Firstly, variables from a
mental health questionnaire showed associations with missingness in multiple dependent variables. Specifically, variables related to emotions, fear, prosocial behavior, and hyperactivity
were important for multiple targets. Secondly, missingness on the questionnaire itself was associated with variables related to alcohol and drug use. Lastly, missingness in the variable
concerning parental supervision was strongly associated with whether the adolescent was likely
tot talk to their father/carer if they had concerns.
The project had a few limitations, including some technical shortcomings. The hyperparameter optimisation process could have been more comprehensive, and the preprocessing steps
were considered too harsh in retrospect. Recommendations for future research included different options to account for imbalanced data, which is ever-present in survey data. Ethical
concerns about interpreting machine learning results and what research in the field on response
mechanisms should emphasise were discussed as well.""""]"
Youth Participation in Climate Action in Kenya,"['Conrad, Anna']","['Mallick, Bishawjit']",2023-09-30T00:01:16Z,EN,['Youth; Climate; Kenya;'],International Development Studies,"Climate change is reshaping the world that young people are due to inherit and will bear the costs for in coming decades. Their activism and climate action activities are vital to the global community and the aspect of climate justice. Kenya is a country that is severely affected by climate change, especially its agricultural sector. With having a population with a large percentage of people below the age of 30, many of Kenya’s youth are being involved in climate action nationally and internationally.  They are met with having to overcome a variety of barrier to be able to participate in the first place and then continue to do so. Education, gender, and family influences are just some of the factors that have a great impact on the way of youth participation. However, young people are found to have a strong sense of responsibly which enables them to overcome some of the barrier in their path. Still, they are left to carry the burden of spreading the knowledge and Appling mitigation and adaptation actions that are not always met with understanding from their communities or families. Without support or recognition, young people fight for their future alone and use their own resources to do so. Further, youth from the global south have a history of not being equally included in international climate activates and academic research related to that. This study sets out to fill that gap by researching what influences the younger generation in Kenya when participating in climate action and how are these factors interrelated. By doing so, difference to the global north become apparent which are important to show that different support is needed in different regions to be able to support youth in their fight for a better future"
Patient recruitment and participation in the Netherlands – an exploration of factors and views,"['Zhou, Huibin']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-09-30T00:01:18Z,EN,['Clinical trial; Patient Recruitment;'],Drug Innovation,"Clinical trials are crucial for evaluating the efficacy and safety of new pharmaceutical treatments, and the Netherlands has the potential to be a world leader in clinical research with its high-quality hospitals, facilities, and healthcare professionals. However, the country lags behind its neighbors in the number of clinical trials conducted, possibly due to longer administrative and more difficult clinical trial processes and requirements, which increase costs for pharmaceutical companies. On the other hand, the prominent role the Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB) is playing within the EU regulatory network represented by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has not resulted in significantly more studies conducted in NL compared with other member states. Another important issue is the slow pace of patient recruitment, which can delay drug development, potential treatments and have financial consequences for the accessibility of innovative therapies. Further research is needed to identify the factors that delay patient recruitment and hinder the full development of the Netherlands' potential in clinical research. In the present study we show that many factors are involved in patient participation and recruitment speed. While some factors have a negative influence on the Dutch clinical trial situation, other factors do not seem to be as relevant. We identified several barriers for clinical trials in The Netherlands, such as the comprehensibility of patient consent, and the availability of personnel. To overcome these barriers, all stakeholders in clinical trials (e.g., patients, pharmaceutical industry, regulatory authorities, healthcare, and academics) have to come together and explore options to improve the clinical trial situation in The Netherlands for the benefit of all patients and the Dutch innovative environment."
Visual Explanations of Runtime Verification Verdicts,"['Mangelaars, Edo']","['Prasetya, Wishnu']",2023-09-30T00:00:51Z,EN,['formal verification; runtime verification; verdicts; temporal logic; metric temporal logic; explanation; visualization; causality'],Computing Science,"In runtime verification, the behavior of a program or system is verified by automatically checking a specification expressed as a property in temporal logic on a finite execution trace.
Understanding why a property is satisfied or violated is crucial in order to identify and repair defects and refine the specification, but for long traces and complex properties this may be difficult.

Eclipse TRACE4CPS™ is an open-source tool for the visualization and analysis of timed execution traces, with functionality for verification of real-time properties in a language based on Metric Temporal Logic (MTL).
It uses informative prefix semantics to check whether the property is TRUE or FALSE, or NON-INFORMATIVE if the trace was truncated before a verdict could definitively be determined.
Intermediate values of the checking procedure can be visualized in the trace view as an explanation of the verdict.

In this thesis, the presentation of the results of runtime verification in TRACE4CPS is improved in three ways, in order to increase the understandability of verdicts.
First, the verification algorithm of TRACE4CPS is extended using a lattice-based four-valued informative prefix semantics to determine whether a NON-INFORMATIVE property is satisfied or violated so far (STILL_TRUE, STILL_FALSE).
Secondly, the explanation features are extended to allow arbitrary subformulas of the property and the real-time constraints of the temporal operators to be visualized in an interactive visual explanation process.
Finally, a method for finding the cause of LTL property violations based on Halpern and Pearl's definition of causality is extended to find the causes of timed MTL properties with FALSE or STILL_FALSE verdicts.
These are then used to generate more concise and accurate universal visual explanations of property violations."

administration’s campaigns to outlaw sex work using feminist justifications. Mainstream feminism 
supports the idea that sex workers are passive victims of prostitution, gender violence, and body 
exploitation who require protection and defense (Bernstein 2007; 2010). Such accounts of what 
could be referred to as “punitive feminism” are frequently shared in official and public discourses 
without taking into account the perspectives and lived experiences of sex workers. When sex 
workers advocate for themselves, they are portrayed as “pimps” or individuals who have the so-called privilege of choosing to engage in sex work, which keeps them out of the mainstream 
feminist circles. Drawing on five months of ethnographic fieldwork between July and December 
2022 in Catalunya, Spain, this thesis explores everyday forms of resistance among sex workers and 
their allies. Going beyond the agency/victim dichotomy, I understand resistance as a tool that sex 
workers use to continue to work and support themselves financially. Through participant 
observation, interviews, online observation, and visual ethnography, I examine sex workers’ 
individual and collective acts of solidarity, community building, creation of alternative spaces, and 
rule-bending due to their systematic vulnerability (Scott 1985; Bourgois 2002). In opposition to the 
discourses and practices of punitive feminism, I argue that sex workers seek to reconstruct their 
own feminist space in order to negotiate against measures that marginalize and criminalize them as 
working-class sex workers and immigrants. Their actions are a counter-response to the punishment 
and re-moralization they face for their alleged transgression of norms (Juliano 2004; 2009). Sex 
workers, united by the Feminismo de las Putas [feminism of whores], oppose the “class-cleaning” 
(Juliano 2009), “criminalization of poverty” (Wacquant 2008), and “sexual moralization” (Smith
and Mac, 2018) of the state and feminism."
A Qualitative Study of the Role and Lived Experience of Community Health Workers within the HIV Treatment Interventions in Eswatini,"['Huang, Sz-Rung']","['Vernooij, E.E.']",2023-10-12T23:00:51Z,EN,['community health workers; Eswatini; lived experience; emotional work; role navigation'],"Social Challenges, Policies and Interventions","Introduction
Community Health Workers (CHWs) are recognized as an essential global workforce to address the gap in healthcare services, especially in resource-constrained countries. However, they often lack structural support and formal recognition. They are also found to undertake multiple roles in their work and perform extra responsibilities. Existing public health literature focuses mainly on evaluating CHWs' performance and effectiveness and tends to neglect the importance of investigating their experiences. As CHWs in Eswatini face similar challenges as those of other countries, this thesis adopted a phenomenological approach and the role theory to understand how RHMs experienced their work and practiced their multiple roles.

Methods
This thesis used existing data collected as part of the HIV treatment interventions, the MaxART program, in Eswatini to investigate Community-Based Volunteers' (CBVs) experience implementing the study. 27 semi-structured and in-depth interviews were conducted with CBVs using a topic list covering various aspects of their roles, perceptions of HIV, and involvement in implementing the EAAA project. Only 17 interviews with Rural Health Motivators (RHMs), the largest represented group of CBVs, were eventually analyzed. Inductive thematic analysis and a phenomenological approach were adopted for data analysis.

Results
This study added new understandings of RHMs' lived experience and how they practiced their roles. Informed by the role theory, the findings revealed RHMs’ various role problems, such as role ambiguity, role overload, role identity, and role insufficiency, while performing their duties. The findings indicated that RHMs did more than their formal obligations, including providing food and following up on patients' medical records. The findings also highlighted RHMs' emotional work, such as providing support and handling negative reactions from the community. Generally, despite challenges, RHMs were recognized by community members for their efforts.

Conclusion
This study underscores a need for further research on RHMs' overlooked emotional work and advocates for increased diversity within RHM programs. Policy implications include providing psychological support and training on interpersonal relationships to support RHMs better. Ultimately, the study emphasizes the importance of considering RHMs' perspectives and experiences to construct a more sustainable healthcare system and support RHMs effectively."

from Athenian illicit urban art studies. Thus, through a Cultural Criminological lens, this thesis aims to 
challenge the stereotypical narrative that graffiti and street art are solely executed by men. Using in- depth interviews with 11 female practitioners in Athens and visual analysis of photographs of their 
graffiti and street art pieces, this study presents how graffiti and street art are practiced and experienced 
by women in Athens. Particularly, this research examines the reasons for women’s initial engagement 
in the practice of graffiti and street art, while also deconstructing the reasons that facilitated Athens in 
becoming a popular illegal graffiti and street art epicentre. Additionally, this thesis shows that the 
physical act of illegal painting results to be a strong, pleasurable body and mind experience for the 
practitioners, highlighting its affective nature. Furthermore, this study showcases the methods, styles, 
and thematic contents adopted by the female practitioners, illustrating their significant role within the 
illegal Athenian graffiti and street art milieu, and describing how women are active members of this 
subculture. Finally, this thesis analyses the relationship of female practitioners with police authorities 
and the public, to evidently examine and understand the encounters between them."

foods and starchy vegetables and recommends high intake of plant-based foods. Adherence to the
PHD has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, the
underlying biological mechanism of this relation is unknown. In our study we develop a
metabolomic signature based on the PHD-score of participants, and
investigate whether this metabolomic signature is associated with CVD.

Data of 4088 participants (mean age 55.6 (9.90), 48.0% men (n= 1963)) from the
Doetinchem Cohort study were used. The PHD-score was assessed using a validated food
frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Metabolites were measured at the Nightingale platform, Finland.
Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to identify the metabolomic
signature (round 4, R4) based on the PHD-score (R4). Cox regression analyses were used to
examine association between the identified metabolomic signature and 10-year incidence CVD (R5-
6).

We identified a metabolomic signature, comprised of 45 metabolites. The signature
consisted mainly of relative lipoprotein concentrations, but also fatty acids, amino acids, ketone
bodies, glycolysis related metabolites, metabolites involved in fluid balance, lipoprotein subclasses,
other lipids, and metabolites involved in inflammation. In Cox regressions, the metabolomic
signature showed a borderline significant association with CVD incidence after adjustment for age,
sex, educational level, and lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity)
