"Model-driven engineering of ethical, social and environmental accounting stakeholder surveys.","['Kruiper, H.E.']","['Espãna, Sergio', 'Overbeek, Sietse']",2020-08-25T18:00:38Z,en,"['Model-Driven Engineering, Ethical Social Environmental auditing, Ethical Social Environmental accounting, taxonomy mapping, content mapping, Domain Specific Language engineering, openESEA, Model Transformation']",Business Informatics,"There is variability in the Ethical Social and Environmental Accounting (ESEA) domain, with differing tools and methods used, since an industry standard is lacking. This is an effect of organisations having differing stakeholder demands, company contexts, and priorities. In addition, stakeholder engagement, enlarging accountability and credibility is sometimes lacking in the process of disclosing ethical topics. All together this results in inefficiencies in the ESEA practise, with problems in comparability, redundancy, legitimacy, and administrative burdens impacting the motivation to report. We therefore propose a Domain Specific Language (DSL), by which a variety of ESEA stakeholder surveys can be defined. This DSL can be used in a tool, so domain experts can configure ESEA methods and features based on common vocabulary. Moreover, this DSL is expressing ESEA methods for 90 percent. At least when considering B Impact Assessment, Global Reporting initiative and Common Good Balance Matrix."
Quality Control and Verification of Citizen Science Wind Observations,"['Chen, J.']","['Frank, Prof. dr. Ir. J.E.', 'Whan, Dr. K.', 'Saunders, Dr. K.R.']",2020-08-25T18:00:40Z,en_US,[],Mathematical Sciences,"Wind observations collected by citizen weather stations (CWS) are valuable for forecasting wind and issuing warnings, yet their quality is not guaranteed. Few people have worked on the quality of such wind data so far. In this thesis, we develop methods to improve the quality of wind data collected by CWS. The methods are applied to filter suspect observations and correct systematic biases, processes that are known as quality control and bias correction. We focus on the wind speed observations recorded by citizen weather stations in the province of Utrecht, the Netherlands, and our data is provided by the third-party platform, WOW-NL (wow.knmi.nl). WOW-NL allows users to upload and view their weather observations in real-time. This thesis consists of four parts: (1) pre-processing the raw data; (2) performing standard quality control that checks the internal consistency, the plausible range, and the temporal consistency of observations; (3) correcting the bias by empirical quantile mapping to reduce the errors mainly caused by low sensor heights; and (4) implementing spatial quality control that compares observations from neighboring stations, where the Earth mover's distance is introduced to select neighbors. More than one-third of low-quality stations are excluded from the study before the standard quality control, based on a lack of data completeness. About three-quarters of the remaining citizen wind speed observations pass all quality control tests. We compare the citizen science data with official data, and use statistical indicators such as Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic and root mean square error to quantify the improvements in data quality after each step. Our results show that the bias correction substantially reduces the errors after the standard quality control, and the spatial quality control further improves the data such that it is comparable with official data. This study demonstrates that the citizen science wind data match well with official data after quality control and bias correction. This means that this data can potentially be used in many applications like analyzing localized extreme wind events that require denser observation networks than currently provided by the official stations."
Industry-Pushed Ways Of Working In User Story Refinement: How Good Are They Really?,"['Berends, J.']","['Dalpiaz, Fabiano', 'Brinkkemper, Sjaak']",2020-08-25T18:00:39Z,en,"['Three amigo sessions, Example mapping, Feature mapping, Shared understanding, Refinement']",Business Informatics,"New techniques for refining requirements in software development are frequently presented. However, these techniques are often not scientifically validated on their performance. In this study, we aim to validate two refinement techniques, Example Mapping and Feature Mapping. These two techniques are both Three Amigo session techniques, in which people from different work together to refine the software increment. Shared understanding is an essential aspect of these sessions. We present a new measurement tool with which the performance of refinement techniques can be investigated, which also incorporates shared understanding. We investi- gate the performance of the refinement techniques with a controlled experiment and four case studies. Based on the results, Example Mapping performs well under certain conditions. We observed a learning effect for the technique, which resulted in better performance of sessions after having used the technique several times. For Feature Mapping, results were inconclusive and additional research is required to establish its performance. When conditions are not right for Example Mapping or Feature Mapping, Three Amigo session principles can still be applied to refinements to result in a well-performing session. Further research could be undertaken to generalise this study’s findings further, studying the long-term effects of the techniques on the implementation of a user story and studying the performance of the techniques when team members are co-located. Additionally, future research can be conducted to compare the Three Amigo session techniques to other refinement techniques, to further investigate the validity of the performance measurement tool and to study the performance of shorter Three Amigo sessions."

Environmental Documentaries as Activism: Rhetoric in Chasing Coral for the coalition of impact,"['Wijnja, W.']","['Hassler-Forest, Dan']",2020-08-27T18:00:11Z,en,['documentary; rhetoric; activism; environmental documentary; chasing coral; coral reefs'],Media en cultuur,"This thesis analyzes the rhetorical strength and activist impact of the 2017 environmental documentary Chasing Coral. In this documentary, a group of filmmakers and scientists set out to document the mass bleaching of coral reefs. Not only does Chasing Coral discuss the importance of coral reefs and the correlation between bleaching and climate change, but the film also focuses on the filmmakers’ struggles in trying to communicate the issue.

The research determines what Bill Nichols defines as “rhetorical voice” of the film. Through its argumentation, the documentary attempts to persuade the viewer of the filmmaker’s perspective that coral bleaching must be addressed. Nichols’s voice is further divided into several additional theoretical concepts, of which style, arrangement and invention are discussed. The analysis tries to determine how information is shared with the viewer (style), how the central argumentation is structured (arrangement) and how the documentary attempts to persuade its viewer of the importance of the issue presented (invention).

Additionally, the analysis looks at how the documentary tries to turn its viewers into activists, both within the film itself and after the screening through the documentary’s outreach campaign. The goal of the outreach campaign is raising awareness for coral bleaching, mobilizing activists and creating long-lasting, political change. The analysis examines five areas of impact in which the documentary contributes to the discourse around coral bleaching.

This research concludes that the narrative of Chasing Coral not only revolves around sharing information about the issue, but also elaborates on the feelings, motivations and struggles of the filmmakers during the production process. Furthermore, the documentary combines different strategies in order to enhance its rhetorical strength, by simultaneously providing logical arguments by experts and allowing the viewer to create emotional connections with the filmmakers. Finally, the film’s outreach campaign offers many tools to maintain viewer interest after viewing the film. The viewer can take individual action by donating and sharing information on social media or organize a collective screening to spread the word in their community. By cooperating with activist organizations, the film has been able to assist in passing legislation in the United States, both at the state and the national level."
Traditional Tunes Transformed: Resonances and Dissonances between Theology and Lived Religion in the Protestant Church on the Central Moluccas,"['Lensink, J.D.T.']","['Meyer, B.']",2020-08-27T18:00:11Z,en,"['Contextual theology, Traditional music, Traditional church music, The Moluccan traditional, Lived religion, Contextual discourse, Transformation']",Religious Studies,"This anthropological research studies the contextualization of church music. At the theological university in Ambon (the Moluccas, Indonesia), UKIM, theologians are developing contextual theology based on the living cultural context of Moluccan Christians. Theologian and musician Christian Izaac Tamaela taught and instigated the transposition of Moluccan traditional music to the Moluccan Protestant church, the GPM. This research asks how traditional music as framed within contextual Moluccan theology is interrelated with lived religion. It traces the grammar and lexicon of the contextual discourse in relation to religious attitudes and practices among UKIM theologians and students, pastors, GPM officials, church council members, congregants, and musicians. Moluccan contextual theology, religious practice in congregational life, and Moluccan traditional music are analyzed. The concept of ‘the Moluccan traditional’ is introduced to disclose the resonances and dissonances between Moluccan theology and lived religion. Defined by openness and mixing, the traditional refers to the process by which a cultural form becomes seen as traditionally Moluccan. It is argued that the implementation of traditional church music depends on a distance between theological innovation and original ritual context. The theological idea is fully brought into practice by resonances between conceptualizations of key terms in the contextual discourse. The recently established ethnic worship service is identified as having the potential to bridge idea and practice when it catches the flexibility of the traditional. Through the entanglements between traditional music, Moluccan culture and Moluccan Christianity, mediated by the ancestors, traditional church music can arouse a sense of Moluccanness."

Furthermore, this study investigates the extent to which this difference between ethnic minority and ethnic majority is mediated by effort-reward imbalance, job strain, and organizational commitment. A total of 165 participants including 85 ethnic majority employees and 80 ethnic minority employees were included into analyze to determine the differences between these groups. Although, ethnic minority employees have higher job strain, higher Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI), and lower organizational commitment than that of ethnic majority employees, the results revealed that there is not a significant difference between ethnicity with respect to subjective wellbeing at workplace. Additionally, it was found that these mediators did not mediate the relationship between ethnicity and SWB except Job strain."

In their engagement with transhumanist discourse, both books discuss to what extent post-humans should have human rights, by evaluating what makes one human in the first place. Ultimately both books are cautiously optimistic about humanity and transhumanism, affirming the good of humanity even while being critical of the bad."

Hair rendering: importance sampling of dual scattering approximation,"['Lemein, J.']","['Veltkamp, R.C.']",2020-08-28T18:00:15Z,en_US,"[""hair rendering, physics based, marschner, zinke, d'eon, eon, graphics, raytracing, dual scattering""]",Game and Media Technology,"Rendering human hair models using individual hair fibers is a challenging task. It is challenging because of the extensive amount of hair fibers required to render a realistic model. Moreover hair fibers are very thin, resulting in noise in the renderings. To reduce this noise in a physically accurate way, more samples need to be taken. Marschner et al. (2003) proposed a physically based single fiber scattering model to render realistic human hair fibers. It is considered the founding work of current approach to physically based rendering human hair fibers.
When rendering light colored hair, multiple fiber scattering is essential for the appearance of the hair color. Zinke et al. (2008) extended the work of Marschner by splitting multiple scattering up into two components: global multiple scattering and local multiple scattering. Global multiple scattering approximates the multiple scattering contribution, thereby reducing the rendering time considerably. Local multiple scattering resembles the Marschner model to keep the single fiber scattering characteristics. This approach is known as the dual-scattering method.
Importance sampling is a widely used noise-reduction technique to speed up renderings. By applying importance sampling, samples are not taken randomly (as is the case for uniform sampling), but are sampled according to a probability density distribution that favors samples that contribute more to the output rendering. This reduces noise faster and thus reduces the amount of samples that are required to produce noise-free renderings. Both uniform and importance sampling should eventually converge to the same result, with importance sampling reaching it faster.
d’Eon et al. (2013) proposed an importance sampling strategy that works particularly well for the Marschner model. This importance sampling strategy can also be applied to the dual scattering method. It is therefore very interesting to evaluate whether applying importance sampling to the dualscattering method reduces the noise as well. This forms the main goal of this thesis: to find out if multiple importance sampling applied to the dualscattering method leads to a significant reduction of noise in the rendered image.
This report concludes by measurement and visual inspection that importance sampling for the dual-scattering method leads to a significant increase in rendering quality compared to uniform sampling. Especially up to 32 samples per pixel the noise is reduced substantially. Such an increase in quality is expected when rendering using a small amount of samples per pixel. It then becomes more important to sample high-contributing directions to reduce noise. This is exactly what multiple importance sampling is doing."
Classifying digital documents reliably using machine learning,"['Hristov, H.S.']","['Feelders, A.J.']",2020-08-28T18:00:12Z,en,"['document image classification, multi modal fusion, machine learning']",Computing Science,"Digital documents are the de facto container to transfer information in our age and due to the growing prevalence of large amounts of documents, organizations may struggle to organize and categorize these documents into their respective categories. In this work, we show how a system that uses real-life documents can use scaling of the neural network architecture EfficientNet and its input images, and we compare its performance with the widely used VGG-16 architecture. We explore how we can augment the input data through RandAugment, a data augmentation strategy which has only 2 parameters which allows the user to search through the search space of possible augmentations faster. We show that transforming the input images can cause a classifier which is not trained on transformed images to perform poorly. We adapt a multi modal fusion method that has not, to this point, been applied to document image classification - tensor fusion. We propose suitable parameters for this approach and compare it to the more standard early and late fusion approaches by training our models on a balanced subset of the widely used Tobacco-3482 dataset. We then apply this approach to our own dataset and draw conclusions on which approach is the most appropriate. Our results show that tensor fusion can be more successful than late fusion but stops short of the performance of the simpler to implement early fusion. Additionally, tensor fusion requires more hyper parameters to be considered which makes the implementation of this approach more difficult. By comparing the results of humans on the ImageNet dataset, we argue that the top 3 predictions of our approach can provide reliable category recommendations."
Variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo simulations of photon transport in liquid xenon detectors,"['Kesber, O.V.']","['Colijn, A.P.']",2020-08-28T18:00:13Z,en,"['Dark matter, Monte Carlo,MC , Variance reduction techniques, VRT, photon transport']",Experimental Physics,"This work is an attempt to improve simulations of background signals in a liquid xenon dark matter experiment. In an experiment such as XENON1T one aims to measure a Dark matter signal. Since such signals have not been recorded, and therefore an effort is made to increase the sensitivity of the experiment. One strategy is by scaling up the experi- ments and thereby increase the active volume of the experiment. With larger detectors, simulations of background signals become more inefficient and will be computationally expensive. However, with advance variance reduction techniques, it is possible to improve the simulation efficiency by three orders of magnitude. This project is centred around one of such a method and provides insight into the working of the method as well as the validation thereof.
Chapter 1 presents an introduction into dark matter and the experimental evidence to support the dark matter hypothesis. Chapter 2 describes the XENON dark matter experiment and the working thereof in more detail. Chapter 3 provides a description of gamma-ray transport and interactions in matter. Chapter 4 introduces an MC method to simulate gamma-rays in a liquid xenon vessel. In chapter 5, a paper is presented that is the result of this research and gives an accurate description of the accelerated MC techniques. Lastly, a conclusion and discussion are provided in chapter 6."
Computational Information Density and Entropy of the Bitcoin blockchain,"['Nesenberend, C.T.']","['Duine, R.A.']",2020-08-28T18:00:14Z,en,"['Entropy, CID, Computational Information Density, Bitcoin, Yakovenko Model, Econophysics, Information, Compression']",Theoretical Physics,"In econophysics, statistical-physics techniques are used to model economical systems. In this thesis, we investigate the entropy and the Computational Information Density (CID) of the Bitcoin blockchain. The CID is defined as the compression ratio of some particular algorithm when applied to the raw data of the state of the system. It is related to entropy as both CID and entropy are measures of information.
We find a strong correspondence between the CID and entropy for the Bitcoin blockchain, where features are similar, but without one being a clear function of the other. This can be explained by intercorrelations between one agent and the next, which the entropy does not count. We also calculate some correlations to see if the CID and the entropy have some predictive power for the price, and we find a small correlation, but very small in comparison to the predictive power of the price itself.
These results the power of the CID-entropy correspondence and how the Bitcoin blockchain may be used as a useful large-scale toy model for econophysics. We anticipate that these results can be used for a further look into the CID-entropy relation, as the similarities are visible but there is no exact correspondence. Besides this, these results can form a basis for a further look into the predictive power of the CID or the entropy for the price."

Problems in control theory can be modelled by a distribution on a manifold, which is a subbundle of the tangent bundle.

In this thesis, we will start by discussing distributions and their properties. An important type of distribution are the bracket-generating distributions. For these distributions, the vector fields tangent to the distribution generate all vector fields on the manifold, by repeatedly applying the Lie bracket. One of the main results in the thesis is Chow's Theorem. Given a manifold endowed with a bracket-generating distribution, Chow's Theorem says that we can connect any two points on the manifold by a path tangent to the distribution.

In the later chapters of the thesis, we will focus on filtered structures. A filtered structure is a filtration of the tangent bundle by distributions. These will provide a weighted analysis for vector fields and smooth functions on the manifold. The main contribution of this thesis is a version of Mitchell's Theorem for filtered structures, saying that a manifold with a filtered structure looks infinitesimally like a Lie group with a left-invariant metric. Another original contribution of the thesis is a global metric induced by a filtered structure."

Motion examples are either extracted from video using pose estimation techniques or taken directly from motion capture data. We show that using our pipeline 1) synthetic data generation is significantly cheaper than real data collection, 2) synthetic data can be valuable for training, and 3) its value can be measured through comparative experimentation."

A guard $g$ sees a point $p \in P$ if the segment $pg$ is contained in~$P$.

We discuss the practical implementation of \viterative that is used to solve this famous visibility problem. This algorithm has theoretical guarantees, as shown by Hengeveld and Miltzow, in a paper written during this thesis. Aside from the vision-stable iterative algorithm, two of its subroutines were implemented as well. One of these algorithms is used to compute weak visibility polygons and the other is used the answer weak visibility queries.
This is the first algorithm for the Art Gallery problem that both has theoretical guarantees and works arguably well in practice.
The main question that we answer is whether the iterative algorithm is feasible in practice.
We performed tests to measure the running time of the algorithm, and show that it does perform quite well practically.
Additionally, several experiments using the practical implementation are discussed, answering questions about the running time of the algorithm such as the standard deviation, sensitivity to input parameters and workload distribution."

By gaining a better understanding of OA heterogeneity, we can potentially contribute to the design of clinical trials, prevention strategies, and treatments. To the best of our knowledge, MBCFD has not been attempted to derive knee OA phenotypes. MBCFD treats the data as curves that can potentially allow us to see complex trends not detected by traditional distance-based clustering algorithms.
Objective: The study aimed to improve OA heterogeneity understanding by testing an MBCFD method’s ability to derive clinically-relevant and statistically-significant phenotypes and to assess its performance vis-a-vis a method widely used in the scientific literature.
Methods: This work is based on the CRISP-IDM method. We identified widely-used algorithms in the literature to derive knee OA phenotypes, as well as their characteristics and derived phenotypes. We selected an appropriate MBCFD algorithm and, through iterative data exploration steps with domain experts, we identified clinically-relevant phenotypes with MBCFD as well as computed the statistical significance between the groups. Subsequently, we compared the performance of the MBCFD method to HCA.
Results: MBCFD was able to detect clinically-relevant and statistically-significant knee OA phenotypes for the univariate case. However, for the multivariate case, the phenotypes were clinically relevant but no statistical significance was found between the groups. In addition, MBCFD outperforms HCA in the univariate case but not in the multivariate case."

These spreading “cold pools” (CPs) can trigger convection and thus new precipitation events due to dynamical and thermodynamical lifting mechanisms. Due to their role in the organization of convection, CP properties are currently being studied with the use of high-resolution numerical simulations. Measurement campaigns have been conducted over the ocean to validate the models. However, fewer studies have targeted ensembles of cold pools over land. We use the observational network of the Netherlands, specifically the 213m Cabauw boundary layer measurement tower and the Herwijnen polarimetric radar, to study CPs developing from summer convection and their role in triggering new convective events over land. We create an algorithm that detects the passage of a CP from the Cabauw tower time series to automatize the detection of CPs from a point measurement time series. The detected CP gust fronts and their generating precipitation cells are studied with imagery from the Herwijnen radar, situated in proximity to the Cabauw tower. We explore the characteristics of the CP gust fronts and interiors with the Cabauw tower time series, and specifically look for evidence of vortex rings, accumulated moisture in the leading edge and dry interiors. Gathering all the CP cases found, we show the measured CP properties in dependence of the precipitation intensity of the generating precipitation cell, and of the environmental conditions. We find positive correlations between the temperature drops and the wind gusts associated with the CPs, and explore the correlations between these properties, the precipitation intensity of the generating cells, and the mean atmospheric moisture before the event. These links will help gain more insight into the role of CPs in organizing convection over land."

Understanding this balance for individual organic compounds has the potential to provide more additional valuable information about past and present atmosphere-biosphere interactions. OM captured in the blank canvas of snow can reflect corresponding signatures of atmospheric OM once their deposition and re-volatilization rates are known. Furthermore, understanding this link between organics in the atmosphere to those found in surface snow will allow for improved interpretations of OM that is eventually preserved in glacial ice. This research builds on a recent pilot study by Materić et al. (2019) which investigated the post-precipitation change of OM in surface snow near the Sonnblick Observatory in the Austrian Alps using thermal-desorption proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (TD-PTR-MS). This research now widens this investigation with an array of surface snow samples taken every alternate day at the observatory and around the surrounding area. Each sample was analyzed using TD-PTR-MS with both filtered and unfiltered protocols to differentiate detected micro and nano scale particles. An assessment of the sample data shows a high correlation between the OM found at the observatory and surrounding sampling locations, as well as a positive detection of nanoplastics using a fingerprinting algorithm developed by Materić et al. (2020). PTR-MS measurements of atmospheric OM in conjunction with meteorological data also recorded at the observatory throughout the snow sampling period suggests a possible link between surface snow OM and a pollution event characterized by a shift in wind direction."

Parents with a migrant background in the Netherlands experience relatively more problems raising their children, and support is therefore needed. Fathers with a migration background generally have less of an input in the upbringing of their children than mothers, and it is more difficult to reach them with interventions. In order to support them, the parenting training “Weerbaar Opvoeden” is given to groups of fathers in Rotterdam. The aim of this research is to investigate to what extent fathers are strengthened during the training in their father role identity and resilience, and what effective factors from the training are. Two observations were made at training meetings with a group first generation Moroccan-Dutch fathers, interviews were done with Moroccan-Dutch fathers (N = 6), interviews with Moroccan-Dutch trainers (N = 2), and a document analysis. Awareness of the importance of the father role, concrete lessons and skills that increase the capacity for self-direction and the belief of being able to influence child-outcomes appear to be important outcomes of the training. Furthermore, the most important effective factors are the trainer, who has a major influence on the success of the training, and a social learning and support effect in sharing experiences with each other. It is recommended to further focus the training on the target group of fathers, in practice and in the documentation of “Weerbaar Opvoeden”.
Samenvatting
Ouders met een migratieachtergrond in Nederland ondervinden relatief meer problemen met het opvoeden van hun kinderen, en ondersteuning is daarom nodig. Vaders met een migratieachtergrond hebben over het algemeen een minder grote inbreng in de opvoeding dan moeders, en worden moeilijker bereikt met interventies. Om hen te ondersteunen wordt de training Weerbaar Opvoeden gegeven aan groepen vaders met een migratieachtergrond in Rotterdam. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om na te gaan in hoeverre vaders tijdens de training versterkt worden in hun vaderrol identiteit en weerbaarheid, en wat werkzame factoren uit de training zijn. Hiervoor zijn twee observaties gedaan bij trainingsbijeenkomsten van een groep eerste generatie Marokkaans-Nederlandse vaders, interviews met Marokkaans-Nederlandse vaders (N = 6), interviews met Marokkaans-Nederlandse trainers (N = 2) en een documentenanalyse. Bewustzijn over het belang van de vaderrol, korte en concrete principes en vaardigheden die het vermogen tot zelfregie vergroten, en het geloof uitkomsten te kunnen beïnvloeden, blijken belangrijke uitkomsten van de training te zijn. Verder blijken als belangrijkste werkzame factoren de trainer, die een grote invloed heeft op het succes van de training, en het delen van ervaringen met elkaar. Aanbevolen wordt om de training verder toe te spitsen op de doelgroep van vaders, ook in de documentatie."

Dit artikel betoogd dat om duidelijk te maken hoe scholen moeten democratiseren, onderzoekers en beleidsmakers expliciet moeten zijn over het perspectief van democratische legitimiteit dat zij aannemen. Dit artikel test dit argument door een puur deliberatief procedureel perspectief toe te passen op de ouderbetrokkenheid bij een onderwijs-pilot. Drie voorwaarden voor democratische ouderbetrokkenheid worden geformuleerd: de ouders moeten goed geïnformeerd zijn over de ontwikkelingen op school, ouders moeten de gelegenheid hebben om deel te nemen aan beraadslaging en besluitvorming, en alle belanghebbenden gedurende het proces als gelijken worden behandeld. Het kwalitatieve onderzoek, waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van semi-gestructureerde interviews met ouders en de schoolfaculteit, beantwoordt de vraag: tot hoeverre voldoet de ouderbetrokkenheid bij het domeinonderwijs aan de voorwaarden van puur deliberatief procedureel democratische legitimiteit? De resultaten geven aan dat de school hoge communicatiestandaarden heeft die ervoor zorgen dat alle ouders goed geïnformeerd zijn. Verder zijn er mogelijkheden om mee te doen met de beraadslaging en besluitvorming. Al is er formele gelijkheid, het wordt gesuggereerd dat domeinonderwijs de relaties tussen de school en de ouders alsook tussen de ouders onderling moet egaliseren om substantieve gelijkheid te realiseren. De discussie suggereert het vaststellen van normen voor democratisch professionalisme binnen de faculteit om de kenniskloof tussen de faculteit en de ouders te dichten. Het artikel concludeert met het erkennen van beperkingen van het onderzoek en het suggereren van implicaties voor toekomstig onderzoek en beleid.

Door deelname aan het landelijk Actieprogramma Dak- en Thuisloze Jongeren streeft Gemeente Utrecht naar een continu verbeterende uitvoeringspraktijk en een vermindering van het aantal dak- en thuisloze jongeren in de leeftijdscategorie van 18-27 jaar in Nederland. Al wordt de behoefte naar huisvesting als het meest noodzakelijk beschouwd, ook in behoeften van andere leefdomeinen voorzien moeten. Daarom is onderzocht hoe de aanpak van Gemeente Utrecht beter kan aansluiten op de wensen en behoeften van dak- en thuisloze jongeren, zodat zij duurzaam kunnen wonen, om daarmee dak- en thuisloosheid terug te dringen. Duurzaam wonen is hierbij het vermijden dat dak- en thuisloze jongeren opnieuw huisvesting verliezen. Belemmeringen en oplossingen met betrekking tot huisvesting, behoeften op andere levensdomeinen waren hierin meegenomen. Vier (voormalig) dak- en thuisloze jongeren en vier professionals zijn geïnterviewd. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de beleidsplannen van Gemeente Utrecht en de invulling van het Actieprogramma goed aansluit op wat nodig is in de praktijk. Naast huisvesting, moet begeleiding op andere leefgebieden niet vergeten worden om dak- en thuisloze jongeren duurzaam te laten wonen. Op basis van de resultaten is aanbevolen om onderlinge samenwerking tussen zorgaanbieders te stimuleren en informatieve websites op te zetten."

Interviews and focus group discussions among140 parents and 17 children were conducted. Results show positive effects of the Parenting Challenge. Participants report beneficial changes in behavior on the nutrition, health, play and protection of  their children. The effective elements of the Parenting Challenges are getting parents together to share problems and ideas through which they experience social support, and providing them with essential information on child rearing. These findings support previous studies arguing parenting education is effective in changing parental behavior and improving child well-being.

In addition, interviews were held with youth that went deeper into filter bubble appreciation. The results show that overall, participants positively appreciate social media filter bubbles, although it is unsure whether they understood the long-term consequences of filtering. Moreover, an effect was found for the strategy knowledge cluster, but other significant effects were found. A preferences contradiction was observed, as participants simultaneously preferred filtering as well as diverse opinions in their social media. It is suspected that youth does not fully comprehend filtering disadvantages, that youth prefers filtering because of its user-friendly advantages, and that the participants did not comprehend the full complexity of the filter bubble concept. Future research should investigate filter bubbles in domains other than the social media domain, to possibly add new perspectives to the ongoing filter bubble debate."

Specific emphasis was placed on how filter bubbles influence news diversity online. The sample consists of second grade students (13-14 years) from a Dutch secondary school. Pre- and post-test questionnaires (N=15) measured youth’s knowledge, awareness, strategy knowledge and strategy usage related to online filter bubbles. Interviews (n=6) were held to get more in-depth insight, especially into the awareness of students of online filter bubbles. The results showed that knowledge of filter bubbles increased (t(14) = 1.96, p = .070). Students had clear ideas about their own online news consumption  and showed high awareness of their own filter bubble and of the pros and cons of filtered news. However, their own internet behaviour as mentioned in the interviews contradicted this awareness. Different explanations for this contradiction, based on other research, are discussed."

A qualitative approach was selected as the research method for this study, through the use of twenty semi-structured interviews. 
Social polarization can damage social cohesion and slow down economic growth, leaving individuals and groups segregated, where social inclusion can enhance the feeling of belonging to the community and lead to less conflicts. The research findings indicate that social polarization is a worldwide issue, as much as it appears in the Dutch society and educational system. Striving for social inclusion is the goal of several municipalities and organizations alike and this research serves the purpose of identifying the prospects of using Utrecht in Dialoog’ methodology as an educational tool. However, the participants do not all share similar experiences of Dialogues as noted in the findings and are not all wishing for the methodology to be applied in the educational field unconditionally."

Deep Decarbonisation of the Dutch Chemical Industry: A Marginal Abatement Cost Curve Analysis for LyondellBasell,"['Yong Min Fen, .']","['Shen, Li']",2020-08-28T18:00:54Z,en,['Decarbonisation; Chemical; MACC'],Energy Science,"Achieving the climate goals stipulated in the Dutch Climate Agreement requires a collective effort from all sectors, particularly the Dutch industry – a major emissions contributor. This study proposes the most appropriate decarbonisation options in achieving (near) net-zero scope 1 and 2 emissions for a major chemical company – LyondellBasell. Specifically, its production sites in Botlek and Maasvlakte. The Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) curve analysis is utilised as the main analysis method to assess the cost-effectiveness and the abatement potential of seven decarbonisation options. This is complemented with a qualitative discussion on the relevant non-economic factors. Together, providing a comprehensive view of both the cost-effectiveness and the implementation feasibility.

The two production sites, which together has a total of 7 main chemical processes, allow optimised product flows and cascaded steam usage across processes and units, and are integrated with external utility companies – resulted in a considerable amount of scope 2 emissions. This research found that 88% of the total scope 1 and 2 emissions is attributable to its steam consumption of around 8 PJ/year. This translates into annual carbon emissions of 416 kton and 620 kton, for the Maasvlakte and Botlek site, respectively. These present deep decarbonisation opportunities for both scope 1 and 2 emissions, through the decarbonisation of high-temperature steam supply.

The MAC curves concluded that the Post-Combustion Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) options are the most cost-effective. The Complete Post-Combustion CCS configuration has a MAC (considering carbon price) of  -33.6 €2018/tCO2 for the Maasvlakte site (79% carbon reduction) and 16.4 €2018/tCO2 for the Botlek site (85% carbon reduction). Followed closely are the hydrogen combustion options with blue or green hydrogen (H2)  and the biomass boiler option. Electricity-dependent technologies are disfavoured due to their high MACs, as the electricity price is projected to increase highly over the analysis period. Nonetheless, the supply scarcity of green H2 and controversial sustainability issues around biomass supply are likely to hinder the implementation of those options. Coupling with energy transition initiatives put forward for the Port of Rotterdam industrial cluster (i.e. PORTHOS and H-Vision), this research concludes that the Post-Combustion CCS and the hydrogen combustion option with blue H2 are the most appropriate options for deep decarbonisation, in terms of both cost-effectiveness and implementation feasibility."
Lebanon’s green plans: Exploring the contribution of cannabis legalisation to sustainable rural development in Lebanon,"['Aaraj, R.

This research reviews the legislation process and describes the differentiated sustainable development outcomes that this legalisation is expected to have on different affected groups. 

The issue of drug production and use, specifically cannabis, is increasingly being assessed from a sustainable development perspective. Both agendas are slowly converging at the global level, and this research feeds into this discussion. 

By conducting a desk study coupled with expert interviews and a narrative analysis of the legislation and the process of its passing, the research is divided into two phases. The first is dedicated to the sustainable development angle, and reviews lessons learned in key countries that made comparable reforms globally. The second focuses on the Lebanese context and lawmaking process to analyse the narrative that accompanies the legalisation. 

The study finds two types of contradictions in the legalisation. First, a disconnect between what the legislation claims to target, and what it is actually expected to result in, and second, a disconnect between the top-down law-making priorities and the actual needs of the affected groups.  

The research concludes that following a global trend in drug policy reform does not automatically mean positive developmental outcomes. On the contrary, this could be another move that reinforces existing power structures and social imbalances. At the local level, the research recommends the integration of this policy into a national sustainable development strategy and a national drug policy strategy rather than operating it in a separate realm."

Numerous studies have been carried out that highlight institutionalization and mutual gains as factors contributing to this cooperation. Realism, however, an important theoretical tradition, has often been ignored, which limits our understanding of EU-China climate change cooperation. This thesis aimed to fill this gap, by adjusting Contingent and Offensive Realism, traditionally preoccupied with military power, to the topic of climate change. In doing so, this thesis identified new factors that contributed to the emergence and endurance of EU-China climate change cooperation. It found that uncertainty reducing communication strategies aided the emergence of EU-China climate change cooperation. Furthermore, it uncovered that endurance of said cooperation was due, at least in part, to (a) recognition of climate change as a common threat and (b) recognition of cooperation as necessary to reduce the common threat. Through its analysis, this thesis demonstrates the explanatory power of Realist theories for EU-China climate change cooperation, thereby warranting future applications of Realism on related topics."

This thesis connects Vonnegut’s extraordinary work to the elusive concept of autofiction: fiction that expresses the inner life of the author purely through their writings. Author-characters are explored through Kilgore Trout in Slaughterhouse Five (1969), the science fiction writer who communicates much truth in his many lies, and the character of Winston Niles Rumfoord in Sirens of Titan (1959), who builds 
the world to his will. Additionally, projective technique will be explored: the extent in which the narrator in Cat’s Cradle (1963) employs the critical distance of an author."

Unsurprisingly, the phenomenon has gained increased attention from both researchers and practitioners. Despite this surge and interest, there is a lack of empirical research regarding the diversity and success of peer economy business models. This study addresses this void by mapping the Dutch peer economy and investigating whether complementarities between business model elements explain their performance. For this, the business models of 88 Dutch peer economy initiatives are operationalized and analyzed. Based on this data, a taxonomy comprising of five groups of business models that account for the total collection of empirically-relevant business models across the Dutch peer economy is revealed. In addition, this study produces no convincing evidence that the complementarities between business model elements predict higher levels of success. This study ends with a discussion of the results and its implications, and suggests a number of future research directions."

Its central argument is that Johan Huizinga’s conception of play as a free and autotelic activity that is separate from ‘ordinary life’ is untenable, and that the notion of play as separable from the material stakes of ‘serious’ activity encourages a depoliticized view of the phenomena that game studies purports to study. Specifically, the field has been reluctant to engage with the politico-economic aspects of videogames. This thesis addresses the stated topic through a framework inspired by Marxism, post-structuralism, left-wing critical theory, feminism, and what it calls ‘critical-materialist’ game studies. Its interventions proceed to broadly cover three main topics, in the meantime engaging closely with the work of scholars such as Roger Caillois, Miguel Sicart, Espen Aarseth, and Joost Raessens. First is digital play itself—what does a critical-materialist theory of digital play look like? In order to understand how digital play is complicit in the reification of cybernetic capitalism we need to conceptualize digital play, following the work of Jean Baudrillard, as a fundamentally seductive world-making relation that is inseparable from the contexts in which it takes place. Second is the Gamer™, which is not an authentic identity but rather a designed technicity. This construct is not merely dependent on a set of identity markers but also on a set of learned behaviours and sensibilities with regards to the videogame medium which do not leave game scholars unaffected. The last investigation concerns game scholars themselves and the academic institutions they inhabit. Especially the Humanities and its students are crumbling under the incessant pressure of neoliberalism, and even those who seek to use cybernetic technologies to move beyond these dynamics remain caught up in them."

Op 15 maart 2020 was het coronavirus in Nederland op een hoogtepunt en werd door het kabinet besloten de scholen te sluiten. Zo werden ook ISK-scholen gesloten en werden de docenten die daar fysieke NT2-lessen gaven, gedwongen om plotseling en snel over te schakelen naar afstandsonderwijs. In dit kwalitatieve onderzoek worden de ervaringen van twee NT2-docenten, A en L, die hiermee te maken hebben gehad in kaart gebracht. De hoofdvraag van het onderzoek is dan ook: wat zijn de ervaringen van ISK-docenten bij het geven van NT2-afstandsonderwijs?
Om deze vraag te kunnen beantwoorden hebben er twee individuele, semigestructureerde interviews plaatsgevonden met docenten A en L en heeft er een groepsgesprek plaatsgevonden. 
Uit de gesprekken is gebleken dat de docenten op één lijn liggen wat betreft hun ervaring met het geven van NT2-afstandsonderwijs. Beiden hebben geroeid met de riemen die ze hadden. De docenten noemden als grootste verschillen voor de leerlingen tussen het fysieke NT2-onderwijs en het NT2-afstandsonderwijs dat de leerlingen veel zelfstandiger moesten zijn, veel minder contact hadden onderling en dus ook veel minder konden samenwerken en een verminderde taalinput hadden vanwege een totaal andere setting. Als grootste verschillen voor henzelf als docent zijnde noemden ze dat ze moeilijker konden inschatten hoe het met een leerling ging en of hij iets wel of niet begreep op afstand en dat je als docent op afstand minder controle had over de volgorde waarin de lesstof werd aangeboden. Beide docenten vonden dat de kwaliteit van het NT2-onderwijs omlaagging door de plotselinge omschakeling van fysiek naar afstandsonderwijs. Ook zagen beide docenten voor zowel de leerlingen als henzelf meer na- dan voordelen van NT2-afstandsonderwijs ten opzichte van fysiek NT2-onderwijs.
 De nadelen werden echter deels veroorzaakt door de coronacrisis en de enorm snelle switch die hierdoor gemaakt moest worden naar een ander soort onderwijs. Wanneer het afstandsonderwijs nu opnieuw door hen gegeven zou moeten worden, is er kans dat er minder nadelen de kop opsteken vanwege de ervaring die beide docenten nu hebben. Vervolgonderzoek hiernaar zou interessant kunnen zijn, om te kunnen beoordelen of dit inderdaad het geval is."

Based on literature findings, we found that a well-designed Escape Room covers all of the most important SEG design elements and thus has a great educational potential. We then selected 3 SEG design elements (immersion, collaboration and a debriefing) and enhanced those in our own portable Escape Room (escape box). The escape box was then tested on 6 biology classes on 2 secondary schools in the Netherlands with students’ ages ranging from 16-20 years old in order to determine the learning gains of the students and to what extent the 3 selected SEG design elements contributed to this. The students filled in a pre- and post-knowledge test and a post-activity survey. Next to those we used observation schemes and semi-structured interviews with students. We found high learning gains (an increase of 93% on content knowledge test scores) and found that a debriefing is essential for the learning gains of the students. A high degree of collaboration was also contributing to those learning gains and to a lesser – but still positive – extent, immersion. Our findings confirmed that Escape Rooms have great educational potential, but educators who want to design an Escape Room should pay particular attention to the debriefing and collaboration elements."

EDPL voor deze talen te laten runnen op datasets die variëren in lettergreepdistributie. Daaruit blijkt dat de talen niet meer problematisch zijn voor datasets waarin zware lettergrepen frequenter voorkomen; sterker nog: ze convergeren sneller op deze datasets dan talen zonder de oorspronkelijk problematische, parametrieke eigenschappen.

European Framework of Reference (CEFR) with regards to literature provide new
possibilities in literary education. Research on literary education shows that emphasis needs to

four ways in which to teach literature, namely, the text-, context-, language-, and reader
approach. Furthermore, researchers on literary education argue that other media, like film,

of Shakespeare’s Henry V, David Michôd’s The King, has given the great history play new
life. This thesis will present a lesson series design that develops students’ higher order
thinking skills of analyzing, evaluating, and creating with regards to the play Henry V in
comparison to the film. Then, interviews will be conducted to evaluate the practicality and
effectiveness of the design. After this, revisions will be made to create a design that is ready

Supporting Chemistry Students' Understanding of Zeolites with Mixed Reality,"['Isarin, A.L.']","['Matimba, H.E.K.']",2020-08-31T18:00:34Z,en,"['Mixed reality, mixed reality design, secondary school chemistry, micro-macro-meso level reasoning, zeolites']",Science Education and Communication,"Mixed reality technology is likely beneficial to chemistry education, yet little research has been done on the topic. In this study, I explore considerations in the design of a mixed reality tool that supports chemistry students’ understanding of zeolites. The design was informed by expert meetings, an expert workshop, concept mapping and rapid prototyping with mixed reality technologies available online. The design was subsequently evaluated via walk-throughs and semi-structured interviews with a chemistry teacher and an educational designer. The findings suggest that, at least for the secondary school level, it is easier to identify learning processes than subject areas that may benefit from mixed reality. Micro-macro-meso level reasoning about carbon cracking with zeolites was found to be a viable topic. Five choices that must be made in the design process are identified and described. Although the findings are not exhaustive, they may serve as an example or starting point for educational designers and chemistry teachers who are designing a mixed reality tool. Recommendations are given about how to select a chemistry subject area or learning process and a mixed reality platform. Outsourcing the development process is only recommended after several prototypes have been developed and evaluated."

"De black box van duurzaam gedrag: Onderzoek naar het effect van een gedifferentieerd communicatiemiddel op de attitude - overtuigingen, emoties, gedragsintenties - en gedragsbarrières ten aanzien van waterbesparing","['Duindam, Y.T.']","['Favier, T.T.']",2020-09-01T18:00:25Z,nl,['overheidscommunicatie; duurzaam watergebruik; gedragsverandering; attitude; overtuigingen; emoties; gedragsintenties; weerstand; duurzaamheidsprofielen; gedifferentieerd communicatiemiddel'],Geografie: educatie en communicatie,"Klimaatverandering en bevolkingsgroei zorgen voor een toenemende druk op het
grondwatersysteem van de Utrechtse Heuvelrug, waardoor de drinkwatervoorraad afneemt,
landbouwgewassen schade oplopen en de natuur verdroogt. Verduurzaming van het
watersysteem van de Utrechtse Heuvelrug is dus urgent. Om het watersysteem van de Utrechtse
Heuvelrug te verduurzamen, werkt de provincie Utrecht samen met een breed scala aan partners
aan de Blauwe Agenda. Het watergebruik van bewoners is hierin een belangrijke schakel. De
provinciale overheid wil het gewenste, duurzame gedrag stimuleren, maar
gedragsbeïnvloedende overheidscommunicatie blijkt al decennialang gebaseerd op
ontoereikende gedragstheorieën en daarmee ineffectief. Waar gedragsbeïnvloedende
overheidscommunicatie jarenlang gericht werd op kennisoverdracht, stellen recente
psychologische inzichten dat: (a) gedrag een complex samenspel is van automatische, emotiegestuurde processen en bewuste, rationele processen; en (b) een interventie moet aansluiten op
hun attitude, die onder mensen sterk kan verschillen door onder andere achterliggende waarden.
Het doel van dit onderzoek is tweeledig, namelijk (a) om te achterhalen hoe
overheidscommunicatie volgens deze recente inzichten het beste vormgegeven kan worden, en
(b) wat de effectiviteit is op de attitude (overtuigingen, emoties en gedragsintenties) en
gedragsbarrières, en of dit effectiever is in het stimuleren van duurzaam gedrag dan
gebruikelijke overheidscommunicatie. Hiervoor werd een gedifferentieerde, expliciete
testinterventie ontworpen voor het waterduurzaamheidsvraagstuk van de Utrechtse Heuvelrug,
dat uniek is vanwege de onzichtbaarheid van de impacts van drinkwatergebruik voor bewoners
zelf, door ondergrondse waterstroming, impact op andere gebieden en andere functies. Een
expliciete communicatie-interventie is hierbij een communicatiemiddel dat inspeelt op de
attitude (en daarmee op een combinatie van bewuste en onbewuste processen). Gedifferentieerd
staat voor een communicatiemiddel met vijf verschillende vormen, die aansluiten op vijf
verschillende duurzaamheidsprofielen (met een verschillende attitude) in de samenleving.
Om dit onderzoeksdoel te behalen is een onderzoek uitgevoerd dat bestond uit drie delen. Eerst
werd een vooronderzoek gedaan dat bestond uit literatuuronderzoek – naar de cognitief en
sociaal-psychologische achtergrond en het duurzaamheidsvraagstuk – en praktijkonderzoek bij
de Provincie Utrecht. Daarna werd een (beperkt) ontwerponderzoek uitgevoerd voor het
ontwerpen van een experimentele interventie – vijf folders, gedifferentieerd naar attitude – en
een controle-interventie – één folder, gebaseerd op de meest recente waterbesparingscampagne.
Er werden twee ontwerpcycli van ontwerpen, testen en evalueren uitgevoerd, met in totaal 12
panelleden. Tot slot werden de interventies getest door deze online voor te leggen aan 133
respondenten, geworven via persoonlijke sociale media en interne media van de Provincie
Utrecht. Deze werden willekeurig verdeeld over de experimentele groep en de controlegroep
en binnen de experimentele groep naar eigen keuze ingedeeld in de vijf condities. Het effect
van de interventies werd gemeten met een enquête, bestaande uit een voortoets en natoets met
stellingen over de eigen attitude, en geanalyseerd met effectgrootteberekeningen, t-toetsen (om
te kijken of het effect significant was) en repeated measures ANOVA’s (voor het verschil tussen
de effecten van de experimentele en controle-interventie).
Het potentiële effect van een foldercampagne op de uiteindelijke gedragsverandering wordt
bepaald door: (a) de effectiviteit van de folders; en (b) de bereidheid onder bewoners om de
folder te pakken – wanneer deze aangeboden wordt – en de gehele folder te lezen. Uit het
onderzoek bleek dat een gedifferentieerd communicatiemiddel resulteerde in een hogere
bereidheid om de gehele folder te lezen dan de gebruikelijke overheidscommunicatie
(middelgroot effectverschil, d = 0,38).
Uit de onderzoeksresultaten bleek dat het effect van een gedifferentieerde communicatie-
interventie verschilde per dimensie van attitude. De gedifferentieerde interventie resulteerde in
positieve, significante effecten (klein tot middelgroot) op: de ervaren ernst (d = 0,51), de
persoonlijke betrokkenheid (d = 0,35), het eigen verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel (d = 0,24), de
ervaren voor- en nadelen (d = 0,34) (emoties); en de intentie tot systeemaanpassingen in huis
of tuin (d = 0,19) en informatie-zoekend gedrag (d = 0,19) (gedragsintenties). Het effect op
informatie-zoekend gedrag kan de andere positieve effecten versterken – mits uitgevoerd.
Hiermee bleek de gedifferentieerde interventie (met kleine effectverschillen) effectiever dan de
huidige interventie op zeven attitudecomponenten, waarvan één overtuiging, vier emoties en
twee gedragsintenties. Twee hiervan waren significant, mogelijk door de relatief kleine
onderzoekspopulatie. De huidige interventie bleek effectiever (met kleine effectverschillen en
een middelgroot effectverschil) op vijf attitudecomponenten, waarvan één overtuiging, één
emotie en drie gedragsbarrières (één weerstand en twee praktische beperkingen). Drie hiervan
waren significant. De afwezigheid van effecten – zelfs kleine negatieve effecten – in de
gedragsintenties en open reacties uit het onderzoek trekken de positieve effecten echter in
twijfel en suggereren dat deze mogelijk worden verklaard door een ander (meer bekend) aanbod
in handelingsmogelijkheden. Dit moet blijken uit nader onderzoek.
Een gedifferentieerd communicatiemiddel bleek relatief het meest effectief voor bewoners met
duurzame idealen en een intrinsieke motivatie voor duurzaam gedrag (kleine tot grote effecten),
maar leidde ook tot opvallend sterke effecten onder doelgroepen met een (relatief) lage
betrokkenheid bij duurzaamheidsvraagstukken – en in het bijzonder waterbesparing. Zo ook
onder structuurzoekers (kleine tot zeer grote effecten) die door de populatieomvang – ongeveer
een derde van de samenleving – tot een relatief grote absolute bijdrage aan waterbesparing
zouden kunnen leiden.
Uit dit onderzoek is gebleken dat een gedifferentieerde communicatie-interventie, gebaseerd op
recente inzichten over gedragsverandering, over het algemeen tot grotere en meer significante
positieve (totaal)effecten op de attitude en ervaren gedragsbarrières leidde dan de gebruikelijke
publiekscommunicatie. Op basis hiervan wordt aan overheden een gedifferentieerde
communicatieaanpak aanbevolen om waterbesparend gedrag onder bewoners te stimuleren.
Met dit onderzoek werd een brug geslagen tussen fundamentele literatuur over
gedragsverandering en de toepassing in de praktijk. Hierbij moest een balans gezocht worden
in het waarborgen van de inhoudsvaliditeit en ecologische onderzoeksvaliditeit. Eventueel
vervolgonderzoek zou zich dus kunnen richten op ofwel verdere validatie van de theorie ofwel
het realiseren en onderzoeken van de campagne in de praktijk. Zo zou verder fundamenteel
onderzoek naar de samenhang van de variabelen de gebruikte modellen kunnen valideren –
zoals het gedragsbeïnvloedingsmodel van Motivaction en het triadisch attitudemodel. Verder
toegepast onderzoek is een relevante manier om het totaaleffect van de foldercampagne met
meer zekerheid te kunnen inschatten of om een werkelijke verandering in waterbesparend
gedrag vast te stellen."
Otherness and Intertextuality in The Witcher. The Duality of Experiencing Andrzej Sapkowski’s Universe,"['Michalska, A.M.']","['Jeroen Salman, Frank Brandsma']",2020-09-01T18:00:38Z,en,['the witcher; intertextuality; otherness; fantasy; sapkowski'],Literatuur vandaag,"Andrzej Sapkowski’s saga The Witcher has been popular amidst Polish audience for
nearly thirty years. It was an inspiration for the CD Projekt Red ́s games, but the
books became bestsellers abroad only after the release of the new Netflix show
(The Witcher, Lauren Hissrich, 2019-). The recent developments in the franchise
shifted the focus back to the novels.

In this paper, I zoom in two ways of experiencing The Witcher: native and
international. Firstly, I put my attention to the original texts and describe the
duality of the morally ambiguous main character. Geralt is not a hero, nor an anti-
hero; his neutrality categorises him as a middle-man, whom I will call a no-hero.
Secondly, I write about the saga’s Slavic folklore which is mixed with (Western)
(anti-)fairy tales and creates an interesting cultural melange. Thirdly and lastly, I
look at the whole franchise and analyse both native and foreign reactions to the
Netflix show. I discuss elements important to these two audiences and explain the
reasons behind The Witcher’s Polish-ness. This closer look at the saga’s cultural and
literary backgrounds explains not only its popularity in Poland but also the reasons
behind its re-discovery by foreigners."

The study was conducted at a secondary school in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. Seven teachers and 676 students participated, all teaching and studying in the senior years of havo and vwo. To collect data on what students and teachers find motivating, a questionnaire was presented to the students and teachers in class. Participants were first asked to think of what (de)motivates them about the subject. Then, they were asked to score motivating and demotivating factors, taken from previous research, on a 1 to 6 scale ranging from [very demotivating] to [very motivating]. The mean scores and standard deviations of each value were calculated. After comparing the results of this study to previous research, five general suggestions to improve motivation through classroom practice were made: Communicative tasks and the use of English are the focus of the lesson content; Theoretical knowledge such as grammar and vocabulary are used in support of the communicative tasks but are never the focus of the lesson;  Both students and teachers can bring their personal interests into the lesson content, Teachers can collaborate with colleagues from other subjects on assignments; Reflection activities are used to evaluate the lesson content and motivation of students and teachers. Three proposals for lesson activities were presented to show how these suggestions can be implemented in the classroom. This master thesis suggests that it is possible to create lesson materials that are motivating to both students and teachers, and that creativity can be used to turn the five suggestions into various lesson activities."

Most research that is available focuses on a specific aspect of spatial awareness development, but an overview of this development doesn’t exist. The aim of this study is to give an overview of the development of spatial awareness in people who are born blind. This will answer the main research question of this study: How does spatial awareness develop in congenitally blind people? Because spatial skills used in the real world may differ from the ones used in mathematics two sub questions emerged: How do spatial awareness skills that are used for spatial functioning in the real world develop? And: How do spatial awareness skills that are used in mathematical geometry develop? To answer these questions, a case study with a single case was done, using two interviews to gain insight in the development of spatial awareness in the congenitally blind participant. The results showed the development of spatial awareness in the participant in real life contexts well, but the development in mathematical context could not be mapped very well, because the participant lacked the mathematical knowledge to go into great depth. Using both findings in literature and the results from the case study, this study concluded with an overview of the development of spatial awareness in congenitally blind people in real life contexts, and an inconclusive overview of findings regarding the development of spatial awareness in mathematical contexts. The most important recommendations for teaching mathematics to congenitally blind students is to provide quality and to understand how radically different their perception of the world is. This study provided several starting points for future research on spatial awareness development in congenitally blind people."

However, there are mixed results in the differences in humor production and appreciation and enough evidence to see if these differences could be explained by a male bias (Mickes et al., 2012; Hooper, Sharpe & Roberts, 2016; Tosun, Vaghihi & Vaid, 2018). Participants (N=163) were asked to perform a humor appreciation task were they were asked to score their appreciation on authorless cartoons from The New Yorker on a Likert-scale. After that they were asked if they thought the same cartoons were written by men of women and the question was asked if they thought males, females or equal were funnier. The next task was an humor production task to create funny captions to four cartoons. No difference was found between gender and humor production, appreciation and male bias. More people see men as funnier than women, regardless of the scores. Male bias was present among all ages. Future research could look is self-efficacy is an explanation for the male bias. It could also be interesting to look whether this bias is present among different cultures."

"“Beauty is universal”
Een vergelijkende analyse naar de inzet van diversiteit in representaties van schoonheid in media-uitingen van L’Oréal, marktleider in de beauty-industrie","['Ende, M.S. van den']","['Ten Thije, J.D.']",2020-09-02T18:00:21Z,nl,"['adverteren, mediagenres, schoonheidsideaal, diversiteit, integratie van analysemodellen, interculturele communicatie']",Interculturele communicatie,"De laatste jaren wordt steeds meer kritiek geuit over het niet divers zijn van media-uitingen. Reclamespotjes en advertenties zouden enkel blanke of hooguit licht getinte personen tonen die tot een bepaalde economische klasse behoren. Dit is problematisch omdat dit eenzijdige schoonheidsideaal onder andere voor een negatief zelfbeeld onder jongeren zorgt (Royal Society for Public Health, 2017). Media-uitingen hebben immers een grote invloed op de beeldvorming van haar ontvangers. Van L’Oréal – marktleider in de beautyindustrie – kan verwacht worden dat zij een voorbeeldfunctie vervult en vooruitstrevend is op het gebied van diversiteit en inclusie. Haar motto “Beauty is universal” (L’Oréal Group, 2020e, par. 2) duidt echter eerder op het uitsluiten van diversiteit. Dit lijkt tegenstrijdig omdat zij al vijftien jaar doel nastreeft om diversiteit op basis van gender, leeftijd, geloofsovertuiging, handicap en sociaaleconomische, etnische en economische achtergronden te waarderen en door te werken in marketing van haar producten (L’Oréal Group, 2019; L’Oréal Group, 2020a).

Deze masterscriptie tracht een antwoord te formuleren op de hoofdvraag: “Hoe wordt diversiteit door L’Oréal ingezet voor de representatie van schoonheid in de drie verschillende mediagenres?” De genres – advertenties, Instagram-posts van L’Oréal en Instagram-posts van influencers – zijn vergeleken door zowel de tekst als het beeld te analyseren op representaties van schoonheid. Daarbij is gebruikgemaakt van een combinatie van analysemethodes, te weten de analyse van de teksthandelingen (Karreman & Van Enschot, 2012), van het samenspel tussen denotatie en connotatie (Brillenburg-Wurth & Rigney, 2009), de interpersoonlijke metafuncties (Bell, 2001; Harrison 2003) en Gestaltwetten (Van den Broek, Koetsenruijter, de Jong & Smit, 2019). De gevonden representaties van schoonheid zijn vervolgens geanalyseerd op de al dan niet aanwezige diversiteitsdimensies (Mazur, 2010).

Uit de resultaten blijkt dat diversiteit op twee manieren ingezet wordt, namelijk als kracht of als middel. Diversiteit als kracht is van toepassing wanneer het aanhalen van diversiteitsdimensies direct verband houdt met de boodschap in de media-uiting. Diversiteit als middel komt tot uiting wanneer de diversiteitsdimensies enkel ingezet worden om de relatie tussen de tekst en het beeld te versterken. Opvallend is dat het getoonde schoonheidsideaal nog altijd gevormd wordt door een jonge, blote en verleidelijke vrouw met een lichte huid en bruine haren.

Tegen haar doel in toont L’Oréal nog altijd een eenzijdig schoonheidsideaal. Een gekleurde of donkere huid blijkt nog steeds een gemarkeerde categorie die ingezet wordt wanneer het een extra doel moet dienen (Urciuoli, 2016; Wekker, 2016). Bijvoorbeeld om de inclusiviteit van het merk indirect uit te beelden. Vervolgonderzoek kan bestaan uit attitudeonderzoek op basis van hetzelfde corpus, de attitude ten aanzien van een advertentie is immers van invloed op de effectiviteit van deze uiting (Gelb & Pickett, 1983). Ook kan het onderzoek herhaald worden op een soortgelijk corpus van een ander land of ander cosmeticamerk dat bekend staat om haar inclusieve karakter."
"Joker, Gevangene in de Franchise: Een analyse naar de manier waarop parateksten waarde op basis van authenticiteit creëren","['Prot, D.']","['Hassler-Forest, D.']",2020-09-02T18:00:21Z,nl,"['authenticiteit, commercie, superheldengenre, brand world, brand culture, branding, \nfranchising, intellectual property, multiplicity, legitimiteit, homogenization']",Film- en Televisiewetenschap,"In deze masterscriptie wordt een onderzoek uitgevoerd naar de manier waarop de film Joker door de 
parateksten wordt gebrand als authentiek. De aanleiding voor dit onderzoek is dat Joker wordt 
opgevat als een innovatieve uiting van het superheldengenre en baanbrekend is op verschillende 
gebieden. Echter, er zijn al veel meer superheldenfilms geweest vóór Joker die spelen met de 
genreconventies van het superheldengenre. De genretheorie- en geschiedenis laat zien dat Joker dus 
inhoudelijk niet innovatief te noemen is binnen het superheldengenre. Met mijn onderzoek wil ik 
illustreren dat de reden waarom het publiek Joker ziet als innovatief en authentiek, samenhangt met 
de branding van (de organisaties achter) Joker. Authenticiteit moet daarbij begrepen worden als iets 
dat niet inherent verbonden is aan de tekst, maar hier buitenom actief kan worden geproduceerd. 
Hiermee positioneer ik mezelf bij de argumentatie van Sarah Banet-Weiser die stelt dat we 
momenteel in een brand culture leven. Als onderdeel van haar theorie stelt ze dat merken evenveel 
over cultuur gaan (authenticiteit) als over economie (commercie). De onderzoeksvraag die centraal 
staat is: Op welke manier creëren de parateksten van Joker waarde op basis van authenticiteit en 
legitimiteit voor de film?  
  Om deze vraag te beantwoorden is een analyse uitgevoerd waarbij ik dit onderwerp benader 
vanuit Critical Media Industry Studies. Dit betekent dat er zowel een tekstuele als een industriële 
invalshoek aanwezig is in de analyse. Er zijn door het doen van een thematische analyse negen 
terugkerende thema’s te onderscheiden die op hun manier waarde creëren voor de film, veelal op 
basis van authenticiteit. De gevonden thema’s zijn: de Oscars, de festivalpremières, de vorm van de 
franchise, de vertolking door Joaquin Phoenix, de vergelijkingen met andere films, het 
onderwerp/thema van de film, de goede elementen in de film, het breken met de genreconventies 
en merk(loyaliteit). De parateksten van Joker voegen elk op hun manier waarde toe aan de film, maar 
ook aan de filmmakers en organisaties die achter de film schuilgaan. Uiteindelijk kan worden gesteld 
dat er hierdoor legitimiteit wordt geconstrueerd voor de film en de filmmakers en dat Joker hierdoor 
sociaal- en cultureel kapitaal vergaart. Omdat Joker zo succesvol is gebleken en effectief waarde 
heeft gecreëerd, is de verwachting dat er meer van dit soort films door franchises in de toekomst 
zullen worden gemaakt."
Tussen mens en machine. Een functieanalyse van de CGI in Alita: Battle Angel,"['Walsteijn, D.M.']","['Pafort-Overduin, C.', 'de Zwaan, K.']",2020-09-02T18:00:20Z,nl,['CGI; science fiction; cyborg'],Media en cultuur,"In dit onderzoek wordt de functie van het met CGI vormgegeven hoofdpersonage in de film Alita: Battle Angel onderzocht. Deze film is als casus gekozen, aangezien de film gebruik maakt van een nieuwe vorm van CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) bij de vormgeving van het hoofdpersonage Alita. Alita toont namelijk een samensmelting van een natuurlijke ofwel menselijke uitstraling en opvallende manga-achtige proporties, die nog niet eerder mogelijk waren met de bestaande CGI techniek. Er wordt allereerst ingegaan op het filmwetenschappelijk discours waarin de film kan worden geplaatst. Zo wordt er betoogt dat filmwetenschappers CGI met name in verband brengen met realisme. Bovendien wordt Alita: Battle Angel in verband gebracht met het bredere filmwetenschappelijk debat over science fiction en meer in het bijzonder over de rol van de cyborg daarbinnen. Vervolgens wordt er gesteld dat er nog een interessante manier is om naar de CGI van Alita te kijken. Doordat het hoofdpersonage Alita aan verschillende lichamen kan worden gekoppeld, roept de film namelijk filosofische vragen op over het gebruik van techniek in het menselijk lichaam. 
	In het theoretisch kader wordt een overzicht gegeven van de belangrijkste auteurs en concepten die in verband staan met de functies van CGI en/of de cyborg. Omdat er voor is gekozen om een neoformalistische analyse uit te voeren, worden deze theorieën niet direct in de analyse op de film toegepast. Vanuit de drie gemaakte protocollen die in de bijlage te vinden zijn, wordt er in de analyse ingegaan op de bijzondere eigenschappen van Alita en welke functie deze dienen. In de analyse is allereerst onderzocht wat Alita’s uiterlijke kenmerken en vaardigheden zijn en welke door CGI mogelijk zijn gemaakt, waarbij er is geanalyseerd in hoeverre deze semes bepalend zijn voor de ontwikkeling van het plot. Bovendien wordt Alita vergeleken met de mens en de cyborg in de film en wordt er onderzocht wat dit zegt over haar rol. Tot slot is er in de analyse ingegaan op de filosofische vragen die het met CGI gecreëerde cyborglichaam van Alita oproept. De analyse heeft aangetoond dat Alita een onderscheidende functie bezit, omdat ze wat betreft uiterlijk en vaardigheden afwijkt van zowel de mens als de cyborg in de film. Bovendien heeft Alita’s lichaam een reflectieve functie, aangezien het lichaam de scheidslijn tussen mens en machine bevraagt en het uitnodigt tot een reflectie over de grenzen van menselijkheid en techniek. De reflectieve functie blijkt overeen te komen met de aangehaalde theorie over science fiction films in het theoretisch kader, maar de onderscheidende functie blijkt een bijzondere eigenschap van deze specifieke film te zijn."

Avec Une tempête, Césaire cherche à décoloniser et décentraliser The Tempest. En s’appropriant le texte de Shakespeare, Césaire en déconstruit les sous-textes. C’est ainsi que le dialogue entre Caliban et Prospero négocie désormais, à un niveau méta, le rapport même entre littérature coloniale et littérature postcoloniale. En sortant Caliban de l’ombre et en lui donnant une voix, Césaire met en lumière et déconstruit les dispositifs discriminants de la colonisation quant à la formation des identités et la reconnaissance des légitimités. À ce titre, Une tempête est une œuvre transculturelle et créole correspondant au projet politique de la Négritude. Notre étude vise ainsi à montrer en quel sens le personnage de Caliban incarne les aspirations de ce mouvement ainsi que les revendications politiques du Black Power Movement aux États-Unis dans les années 1960 et 1970.

The aim of this study is to understand Une tempête as Césaire’s attempt to decolonize and to decentre The Tempest. Césaire creates dialogue between Caliban and Prospero with his appropriation of The Tempest while mediating between colonial and postcolonial literature. By taking Caliban out of the shadow and by giving him a voice, Césaire offers a reflection on the consequences of colonialism on identity formation. The central point in Une tempête is the struggle for an autonomous identity, whereby Césaire simultaneously questions the dominance of the European cultural heritage. Césaire does this by making Une tempête a transcultural and creole work that moves between the canonical text of Shakespeare and his own adaptation, in which the oppressed are able to regain their voice. Furthermore, Caliban’s inner identity struggle, visible throughout the whole play, can also be extended to Césaire’s political Négritude project. Césaire interrogates the hierarchical relation between the metropolitan centre and the periphery by incorporating the Négritude political movement and the political climate of the Black Power Movement in the United States of America in the 1960s and 1970s."

Due to technological advances, new modes of global mobility and information sharing have facilitated migration. Some of the issues migrants have been, and still are, facing in new social environments have to do with discrimination and incomprehension of values and behaviours. However, previous research suggests that interaction with different cultures can be beneficial for understanding, accepting and respecting differences between cultures (Allport, 1954; Caligiuri, Jacobs & Farr, 2000; Stemler, Imada & Sorkin, 2015; Holliday, 2016). Using a contrastive approach of quantitative data, this study aims to investigate whether an extensive international experience (EIE) has an effect on the attitudes held towards migrants through increased intercultural competencies learned in a foreign context. The present study specifically focuses on the attitudes held by Dutch citizens towards Syrian migrants. A total of 110 participants completed a self-assessment survey that measured the attitudes by means of a 7-point Likert scale. In addition, participants were asked whether they had been on an extensive international experience, and, if so, information was gathered on where they had been, the duration and purpose of their stay, the number of instances they had undertaken an EIE and whether they had learned the local language during their stay. In accordance with the main hypothesis, the EIE participants group showed a more positive attitude towards Syrian migrants. Moreover, participants who had learned the local language during an EIE held an even more positive attitude towards Syrian migrants."
Gender and Race Representation in Disney: A Study on Stereotypical Women’s Language Forms in Racially Diverse Third Era Disney Films,"['Chami, M.

The significance of this study lies in the intersection of children’s identity formation, and the key role normative roles and behaviours emphasised through language in films plays into that. Previous research has compared Disney’s first and second era films but there is a lack of third era films comparative studies in this field. In addition, the study focuses on third era films due to its diverse cast from different racial backgrounds and the focus on the lead female character. The aim of this research is to examine the function, similarities, and differences of Disney’s racially diverse female characters use of these forms, namely empty adjectives, super polite forms, and interruptions in cross- sex conversations. In addition, it observes the use of other gendered language forms and their function in relation to race. The third era films chosen were The Princess and the Frog (2009), Frozen (2013), and Moana (2016) with a focus on its leading human female characters’ conversation with human male encounters. The results and their analysis suggest that although there is no relation between the use of stereotypical women’s language forms and race, female and male characters are still put in a normative frame through the use of stereotypical women’s language forms and other gendered language forms while following their conventional functions. The results also show that despite the shift in including more diverse female characters from an imagological perspective, Disney’s female characters continue to use stereotypical women’s language forms for the majority of the time following the functions laid out decades ago by Robin Lakoff (1976) and Deborah Tannen (1994). Overall, this study aims to highlight the importance of analysing the messages sent through children-oriented films, namely Disney, through language forms while taking into account the role gender and race play in the formation of humans’ multi-layered identity."
News Framing of Brexit in Local Newspapers across the UK's Twelve Regions,"['Schotte, L.']","['Supheert, R', 'Micklos, A']",2020-09-02T18:00:20Z,en,"['Brexit, political journalism, news framing, language studies, newspapers']",Interculturele communicatie,"The UK is the first country to voluntarily exit the European Union, under the name of Brexit. The Brexit referendum took place in 2016 and has received vast amounts of news coverage on an international, national, regional, and local scale since. Local newspapers have proven to be a reliant source of information for the public and can influence the public’s decision-making process by means of news framing. The present study aimed to discover how this news framing has shifted since the initial referendum in 2016 by taking the field of Intercultural Communication into the realm of language studies. As little research has been conducted on regional or local levels of news framing in the UK and the referendum results indicate that not all regions were in favour of the Brexit result, the present research aimed to fill this knowledge gap. A corpus analysis, critical discourse analysis, and collocate analysis of local newspaper articles from each of the UK’s twelve regions facilitated the detection of a news framing shift. Local British newspapers shifted in news framing in terms of economic consequences, responsibility, conflict, and human interest when reporting on Brexit and are more inclined to discuss Brexit more frequently and frame the phenomenon more directly since 2016. Further research suggests discovering if these outcomes have indeed influenced the British public’s decision-making process when voting for Brexit in 2016 and the General Election in 2019 by means of a survey."

The university aims to be more inclusive, with the priority of hiring international staff, which would help improve the quality of research and education of the institution through internationalisation on a large scale. However, alanguage barrier arises, as the official language of the administration is Dutch and not many internationals have adequate proficiency in it.Therefore, this study aims to investigate the use of Lingua Receptiva as a potential solution to avoid the choice of a single language in the University Council meetings of Utrecht University,maintaining the current quality of the debate also during Dutch-English meetings.Lingua Receptiva (LaRa) is the multilingual communicative mode in which people use different languages and understand each other at the basis of the receptive proficiency in the language of the other.

This multilingual communication management, supported by communicative modes such as codeswitching, English as lingua franca and translation/interpretation could facilitate communication between the two groups, leading to the maintenance of the current quality of debate and contributing to the involvement of Dutch and international members as part of the same academic community. These two factors have been the focus of this research, as the author is an international student herself, there has been personal involvement and interest in the issue. The text starts with a framework of the current situation Utrecht University is now facing, reaching its objective of innovation and improvement, and an explanation of the function of the University Council and the structure of its meetings. An important role is then given to the definition of Lingua Receptiva and the measures for its implementation, accompanied by a clarification of what is meant with quality of debate.

Cumulative interviews were conducted with 19 participants, among the university and Faculty Council members and the administrative support staff. Analysis of the responses demonstrated that the quality of debate does not generally depend on the language used, but there could still be an improvement if people were allowed to speak a language they are comfortable with. The results indicate that to achieve adequate communication, preparedness on the topics discussed during the encounters is essential, alongside the concepts of participation and inclusiveness. The attitude towards LaRa was mainly positive, since a more efficient conversation could be achieved with the aim of understanding each other despite the differences.  

On this basis, it is advised to organise receptive language courses with a major focus on the language of administration, to allow international students and staff members to acquire the terminology needed to understand the University Council discussions on a high level of proficiency. Bilingual documents may be provided to support international members, with the addition of a small glossary of Dutch and English institutional keywords. Furthermore, a third party has been indicated by the majority of international and some Dutch respondents as necessary to arrange interpretation of the conversation and to mediate between the cultures. In case the implementation of LaRa would not result in a positive outcome, valuable alternatives proposed by the respondents of the research have been laid out, followed by recommendations."

La ricerca parte dal presupposto, emerso dalla ricerca precedente dell’autrice (Arentsen, 2019), che ci sia una differenza nell’importanza del cibo per le culture. La tesi di van Otterloo (1986) suggerisce invece che non ci sia nessuna differenza tra culture nel mantenimento delle abitudini alimentari. Sulla base di ciò la seguente domanda di ricerca si forma: “Il ruolo del cibo nella costruzione dell’identità nazionale in un contesto di migrazione è un fenomeno universale o un fenomeno cultural specific?”. In base alla ricerca precedente della sottoscritta e alla lettura della tradizione di studi sul tema, si ipotizza che il ruolo del cibo differisca da cultura a cultura.
Pe rispondere a questa domanda e confermare l’ipotesi proposta è stato preparato un questionario online con una parte quantitativa (domande a scelte multipla) e una parte qualitativa (domande aperte). Il questionario prende in considerazione diverse variabili come la durata del soggiorno all’estero, il contatto con il paese di origine e le abitudini alimentari. Sono stati intervistati migranti olandesi in Italia e migranti italiani in Olanda. Successivamente i dati raccolti sono stati analizzati statisticamente tramite l’uso di SPSS. Dai risultati è emerso che si esiste una differenza sostanziale tra i migranti olandesi e italiani. Se guardiamo alle risposte sulle domande aperte, si pare che i migranti italiani vedano il cibo come parte della loro identità, dove gli olandesi ogni tanto si mancano prodotti olandesi ma non vedono il cibo come parte della loro identità. Se guardiamo al tempo di soggiorno, vediamo una differenza leggera in tre fasi. Però, questa differenza non è affidabile a causa della sproporzionalità dei gruppi di tempo di soggiorno. C’è visibile anche una correlazione piccola tra il contatto con il paese d’origine e il consumo dei piatti olandesi con i migranti olandesi. I risultati significherebbero che il fenomeno descritto da van Otterloo (1986) non è universale ma cultural specific."

The data retrieved throughout these forums served as the backbone for a survey to be administered to locals from each city. The instruments aimed to identify trends on whether locals from either city promote multicultural activities and food or rather perhaps elements of national culture. The study revealed that there were no overwhelming differences between the way locals from either Toronto or Brussels sell their city to tourists. Noteworthy was the discovery that Brussels locals who speak three or more languages responded with more positive attitudes towards encouraging locals to explore all neighbourhoods of their city and to try ethnic food. Along those same lines, when asked about the types of cuisine a local would recommend, nearly all Toronto participants indicated that they would suggest that tourists eat ethnic food whereas almost all those from Brussels responded that they would recommend Belgian food."

Het maatschappelijke en wetenschappelijke debat omtrent kinderen en media valt nog vaak terug op een zwart-wit narratief waarbij kinderen worden neergezet als passieve slachtoffers van de machtige media of als ‘van nature mediawijs’. Om een complexer beeld te schetsen bouwt dit onderzoek voort op mediawetenschappelijke publicaties. Theorieën over de discursieve constructie van een publiek en van kindertijd, en de rol die interfaces spelen binnen deze constructie, worden daarvoor ingezet. De daarop aansluitende discursieve interface-analyse van Mel Stanfill is gebruikt om te analyseren welk beeld van kinderen en hun relatie tot media de websites en apps van het commerciële Nickelodeon en het publieke Zapp produceren. Daaruit bleek dat de platformen het beeld van kinderen als individuele kijkers van een continue flow van content normaliseren. In deze casus zijn de verschillen tussen een commercieel en publiek platform minimaal. In tegenstelling tot argumenten van andere academici over kindertelevisie en publieke media, worden kinderen in beide gevallen nauwelijks als consumenten of participanten geadresseerd. Dit roept de vraag op of het creëren van een online omgeving op gespannen voet staat met participatie en consumptie."

Filmtheoreticus André Bazin is bijvoorbeeld van mening dat de long take een objectieve filmtechniek is. Dat houdt in dat het aandeel van de menselijke hand in het tonen van de werkelijkheid minimaal is. Bazin schrijft dat er met de long take geen illusie kan worden gecreëerd rondom ruimte en tijd. Hij plaatst de long take tegenover montage, waarmee een illusie van ruimte en tijd wel gecreëerd kan worden. Bazins ideeën zijn echter niet onomstreden. Filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini is van mening dat de long take subjectief is en montage objectief. John Rhodes beschrijft dat de long take door de afwezigheid van aanwijzingen voor vervreemding bij de kijker zorgt, terwijl Bill Nichols beargumenteert dat de transparante vertellingstechniek voor een “reality effect” zorgt, wat als verbinding tussen de kijker en het getoonde kan worden gezien.
Dit onderzoek richt zich op de functie van het device de long take in de Georgische film Mijn Gelukkige Familie. Deze functie wordt onderzocht door middel van de neoformalistische methode die Kristin Thompson beschrijft in haar boek Breaking the Glass Armor. De film vertelt het ongebruikelijke verhaal van Manana, een Georgische moeder van in de vijftig, die haar ouderlijk huis verlaat. Manana’s besluit gaat in tegen de heersende Georgische culture norm die bepaalt dat de moeder haar leven in dienst moet stellen van haar familie. De long takes benadrukken de plot points van de narratieve structuur van de film, iets wat geen van de besproken theoretici als mogelijkheid beschrijft."

Mahabharata, but are rewritten around identities that the mainstream marginalizes. The
protagonists of “Kunti and the Nishadin”, “The Five Women”, and “Souvali” are placed in
subordinate positions in society as depicted through the epic. These women characters of women
of lower castes and lower classes remain unspoken for in mainstream versions of the mythology.
The essay untangles the complexities of the fictive characters’ identities with these markers of
gender, caste and class, understanding the intersectionality of their identities. It also analyses them
as gendered subalterns, using and questioning Gayatri Spivak’s conceptualization. The thesis also
contextualizes the analysis of the stories against the larger background of Devi’s literary oeuvre
and activism with tribals and Adivasis in India. It does so by attempting an intertextual reading of
the epic contrasted with Mahasweta Devi’s retellings with emphasis on the narration and elements
such as folklore and oral tradition."

in the movie within a suburban school. The way the teachers are represented is discussed,
particularly within the notion of the “White Savior Syndrome”. In The Freedom Writers, the
students succeed at school because of their teacher who also allows them to change their
perception of school and life itself. In Entre les Murs, the teacher acts as an example that permits
the students to resist stigmatization. Whilst transmitting knowledge, like language and being
aware of how to behave, in other words “the rules of society”, he tries to offer them access to a
different social circle than their own. In both movies the students are relatively represented in
a stereotypical way. The “shallowness” of the students knowledge is emphasized as well as
their immature behaviour. A particular attention has been paid to language as a marker of
identity. The mutual connections between language, identity, culture, stereotype and
representation of “school” present in the two movies, are studied in this thesis."
Sebald Behams Drie vrouwen in een badkamer (1548): Het gebruik en de betekenis van een homo-erotische prent van miniatuurformaat in het zestiende-eeuwse Duitssprekende deel van Europa,"['Nieuwenhuis, E.']","['-, Dr. Sarah Moran']",2020-09-02T18:00:32Z,nl,"['Beham, Kleinmeister, prenten, verzamelcultuur, erotica, homo-erotica, zestiende eeuw']",Kunstgeschiedenis,"In 1548 vervaardigde de Neurenbergse prentmaker Sebald Beham de prent Drie vrouwen in een badkamer. Op de afbeelding zijn drie naakte vrouwen en een kind in een badhuis weergegeven; de zittende vrouw betast met haar hand het geslachtsdeel van de staande vrouw. De prent is niet alleen opvallend vanwege zijn homo-erotische inhoud, maar ook vanwege zijn formaat. De prent is slechts 83 bij 58 millimeter groot, hoewel tot het begin van de zestiende eeuw miniatuurprenten vrijwel altijd devotionele afbeeldingen waren. Met zijn seculiere, homo-erotische inhoud en kleine formaat, is Drie vrouwen in een badkamer dus een uitzonderlijke prent in Duitsland in de zestiende eeuw. In deze paper worden dan ook de functie en betekenis uiteengezet, die Drie vrouwen in een badkamer had in het zestiende-eeuwse, protestantse, Duitssprekende deel van Europa. De prent wordt bestudeerd als object ter herinnering aan de juiste moraal, als erotisch object en als verzamelobject.
	In Europa ten noorden van de Alpen bevatten prenten waarin seksualiteit verbeeld werd vaak een waarschuwing voor immoreel gedrag. De man werd vaak weergegeven als een dwaas, tot zotheid gebracht door de verleiding van de vrouw. In zestiende-eeuwse moraliserende prenten worden vrouwen vaak weergegeven als wellustig en bedrieglijk, wat in prenten van onder andere de gebroeders Beham terug te zien is in weergaven van de zondeval, badhuizen en heksen. Dergelijke prenten waarschuwden voor vrouwen die niet voldeden aan het protestantse beeld van de ideale huisvrouw, die tot doel had nageslacht voort te brengen.
	  Hoewel homoseksualiteit als zondig werd gezien en zelfs werd bestraft, komen in de zestiende eeuw sporadisch homo-erotische voorstellingen voor. Erotische afbeeldingen waren sinds de begintijd van de prentcultuur geliefd en gewild door de hogere klassen van  de samenleving. In tegenstelling tot de noordelijke erotica, waren de Italiaanse erotica zeer expliciet van aard, veelal gebaseerd op mythologische verhalen. Erotische prenten circuleerden in zowel het noorden als het zuiden van Europa in de hogere kringen van de samenleving. 
	In de vijftiende en zestiende eeuw ontstonden er, onder invloed van de humanistische cultuur van de stadse elites, verzamelingen van een breed scala aan objecten in Europa. In het noorden werden vanaf ongeveer 1550 prenten verzameld. De miniatuurprenten van de Kleinmeister waren vanwege hun formaat een geliefd verzamelobject. Uit inventarissen van zestiende-eeuwse collecties blijkt dat prenten van allerlei onderwerpen, zo ook (homo-)erotica, onderdeel waren van prentcollecties. Zo was ook Drie vrouwen in een badkamer opgenomen in ten minste één prominente Neurenbergse verzameling, in nabijheid van andere erotische prenten van de gebroeders Beham. Drie vrouwen in een  badkamer fungeerde daarom hoogstwaarschijnlijk als erotisch object binnen de context van prentenverzamelingen. Hoewel de prent te begrijpen is binnen een breder discours over seksualiteit en de representatie van vrouwen, is de eventuele morele boodschap ondergeschikt aan diens erotische kwaliteiten en functie als verzamelwaar."

The analysis zooms in on (i) the post-civil war evolution of Lebanon’s political economy and the grievances it exacerbated in citizens, and (ii) the strategies by which the new wave of movements re-negotiate their room for manoeuvre within the Lebanese political structure. In order to illustrate these grassroots strategies, the thesis describes and contrasts the discourse, as well as the concrete actions of two non-sectarian movements. First, a ‘civil society’ political coalition titled Kollouna Watani is introduced that challenged the established elites by competing in Lebanon’s 2018 general elections. Second, the mass protest movement starting in October 2019 is examined which demanded structural reforms in the country’s sectarian power-sharing order. The author situates her analysis in the recently emerged debate on the process of ‘de-sectarianization’ in the Middle East that discusses the possibilities for de-constructing instrumentally and institutionally reinforced boundaries in multi-confessional societies. By combining this lens with materials supporting the agency of social movements, the thesis contributes to the understanding of Lebanese grassroots actors’ potential and challenges to push for non-sectarian transformation from the bottom up."

negotiations. The timing of peace negotiations focuses on “the ripest moment,” applying ripeness 
and readiness theories, which are included in this paper. However, as those theories are mainly 
useful in hindsight, this paper goes further to incorporate Stedman’s theory of spoilers to develop 
this study on the timing of negotiations. The components of readiness, motivation and optimism, 
combined with addressing spoilers in this paper offers a different approach to analyzing the timing 
of negotiations. Through four cases study of the peace processes in Uganda in 1988, Sierra Leone in 
1999, the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2009 and South Sudan in 2015, this paper finds that 
the convergence of motivation, optimism and addressing spoilers is important to successful

Following Yanow’s steps, first, three interpretive communities are identified: the government as creators of the policy (date = IEP document), experts as practitioners (data = three interviews), and people with disabilities (PwD) as recipients of the policy (data = four interviews). Next, for each group, different frames are identified. From there, different frame conflicts were uncovered. The two main conflicts are about: what exactly the problems are that the policy should solve, and what the role of the government is in solving these. Other frame conflicts on the policy and solutions arose from these. Additionally, this research shows that within IPA, more focus should be placed on how having a disability and having similar experiences plays a role in the formation of interpretive communities. Furthermore, recommendations are presented for future research and policy-makers inside and outside of Namibia."
"The World as the Whole: Culture, Ecology and Holistic Worldbuilding in N.K. Jemisin’s The Broken Earth trilogy","['Bijnen, K.']","['Idema, Tom']",2020-09-02T18:00:33Z,en,"['ecology, worldbuilding, science fiction, fantasy, ecocriticism']",Literatuur vandaag,"The thesis analyses the relationship between ecology and social and cultural dynamics in the imagined world of The Broken Earth trilogy by N.K. Jemisin. It believes their interconnection is ecocritically relevant for how people engage with environmental crises like climate change. The thesis coins the term holistic worldbuilding for the representations of these interconnected dynamics, which are relevant for how people engage with environmental crises like climate change. Holistic worldbuilding emphasises the interaction and interrelation between human culture and nature, and rejects conflict as the only element that drives a narrative. It adds to ecocritical thought in that it argues for solidarity and empathy not just between human culture and nature, but between human cultures, too. The thesis then analyses the relationship between the people and their planet, and between different cultural groups. Through close reading, it focuses on ecological elements of the imagined world and cultural lore that informs people’s lives, arguing that each shapes the other. Continuing its close reading, the thesis also analyses oppressive power structures and the cultural dynamics that keep these in place, and how these are tied to the environmental circumstances of the imagined world. Finally, the thesis reviews narrative techniques that the trilogy uses that contribute to its holistic worldbuilding. Using Jemisin’s use of worldbuilding, this thesis argues that The Broken Earth trilogy can inspire a rethinking of how humans can engage and coexist with their environment differently."
Lezen is zeg maar echt mijn ding. Hoe educatieve uitgevers leesmotivatie van leerlingen willen vergroten.,"['Manen, N. van']","['Evers-Vermeul, Dr. J.']",2020-09-02T18:00:38Z,nl,"['Leesbevordering, leesmotivatie, lezen, lesmethodes Nederlands, educatieve uitgeverijen']",Neerlandistiek,"Verschillende internationale onderzoeken laten zien dat het leesplezier van Nederlandse jongeren erg laag is. Er is dan ook veel bereidheid om hier iets aan te doen, zowel vanuit de overheid als het onderwijs en allerlei betrokken organisaties. De geplande curriculumherziening lijkt de meest centrale mogelijkheid om dit probleem aan te pakken. Op dit moment liggen er voorstellen van Curriculum.nu voor de herziening van de eindtermen van onder andere het vak Nederlands, waarin wordt gevraagd om meer aandacht voor leesmotivatie en literaire competentie. Uit onderzoek blijkt dat educatieve uitgevers een belangrijke rol kunnen spelen bij de implementatie van de eindtermen die vastgelegd zijn in het curriculum, omdat docenten erg methodevast zijn in Nederland. Daarom zijn voor dit onderzoek zes uitgevers geïnterviewd die voor meerdere niveaus in het voortgezet onderwijs lesmethodes Nederlands ontwikkelen. Het doel van deze interviews was om te achterhalen welke mogelijkheden educatieve uitgevers zien voor het vergroten van leesmotivatie via lesmethodes Nederlands. 
Uit de resultaten blijkt dat uitgevers graag meer willen doen met leesmotivatie en dat zij het belang hiervan sterk inzien, maar dat factoren als marktwerking en de traditionele houding van docenten dit bemoeilijken. Uitgevers zijn het unaniem eens over de stelling dat de overheid meer mag sturen op dit gebied. Om te zorgen dat leerlingen weer echt gaan lezen om de inhoud, is de oplossing volgens uitgevers om minder teksten met standaardvragen bij leesopdrachten aan te bieden en grammatica meer naar de achtergrond te brengen. Als alle uitgevers een andere koers gaan varen, kunnen zij volgens de geïnterviewden een sterke verandering in het leesbevorderingsveld teweegbrengen, waarbij leesbevorderingsorganisaties en bibliotheken ondersteuning kunnen bieden. Wanneer iets niet in de methode staat, is de kans dat dit wel in het onderwijs terecht komt namelijk heel klein. Een belangrijke kanttekening die uitgevers daarbij plaatsen is dat docenten de markt voor leermiddelen en de onderwijspraktijk bepalen en dat docenten bij de implementatie van een nieuw curriculum dus minstens zo belangrijk zijn als uitgevers."

I explore why reading autobiographical works that were published during earlier feminist waves and written by women from marginalised positions is important for the current feminist movement. I first discuss feminist and literary theories and introduce relevant terms and definitions in the “Theoretical Framework,” before continuing with a discussion of the genre of autobiography in relation to feminism in Chapter One. In Chapter Two, I explore Caged Bird, Hidden Face, and Wild Swans with regard to contemporary feminism by discussing the wave narrative and relevant topics discussed in the books. Chapter Three revolves around the personal experiences of Angelou, Saadawi, and Chang and analyses how their experiences differ from those most often represented in mainstream feminism. These chapters all support the belief that these autobiographical narratives are not restricted to being regarded as significant in one specific time period. Moreover, the chapters demonstrate that the experiences of women that write from the periphery are especially important for contemporary feminism’s understanding of “intersectionality,” which raises awareness to the different axes that are involved with the gender discrimination against women on both local and global levels."
Imagined Solutions to Real Problems: How the Dutch government presented the corona-app as the solution to the COVID-19 crisis,"['Graaf, L. de']","['Schäfer, M.T.']",2020-09-02T18:00:39Z,en,"['pandemic, corona-app, imaginary, mediatisation, solutionism']",New Media and Digital Culture,"Governments worldwide have enlisted technological solutions in the form of tracing apps to combat the pandemic. There is little proof of these apps actually working and contributing to ending the lockdown. The Dutch government has also suggested to start designing and implementing a corona-app. In doing so, the government has exposed a rhetoric of techno-solutionism in their press conferences, public documents and their first appathon. This research focuses on how the Dutch government frames the app as a solution to the “intelligent lockdown” while it was more so part of the political rhetoric. Using the concepts of techno-solutionism, technological imaginary and mediatisation, this research dissects the Dutch government’s rhetoric surrounding the app. This was done through the methods of close reading and discourse analysis. The research concludes that the Dutch government approached the usage of the corona-app in the combatting of the pandemic as an urgent, intelligent, efficient and legitimate solution. The analysis has thereby shown that the Dutch government displayed a determined techno-solutionist approach to combatting the pandemic and had disproportionate expectations of the effectiveness of the app. This is problematic since there is a disregard for alternative solutions and key human values. This development fits in multiple ongoing debates, those of technological solutionism, critical data studies and technological determinism vs. social constructivism."
Rapid Response Collecting: A Curatorial Strategy for Museums to Promote Notions of Democracy and Social Equality,"['Tenenbaum, D.I.']","['Verhoeff, Dr. Nanna']",2020-09-02T18:00:40Z,en,"['Rapid Response Collecting, RRC, Museums, Museum, Curating, Curating Strategy']",Arts and Society,"We live in a museum age, Steven Conn writes. Indeed, since the turn of the 21st- century museums are taking a more central role in society as more and more people visit them each year. At the same time, an increasing amount of voices in the art world are calling for a more politically and socially engaged cultural sphere. This demand strengthens the urgency for the establishment of new forms of curating which will cater to this necessity for museums to be more involved with society through political and societal engagement.

In this thesis, I suggest Rapid Response Collecting (RRC) as a strategy for museums to increase their social engagement. RRC is a new and developing method of curating that responds to recent societal, political, and cultural events by selecting, acquiring, and presenting artifacts that reflect on these events. It is increasing the position of the museum as a socially engaged institution and elevates it into a key player in crucial societal debates. Furthermore, RRC encourages curators to develop participatory curating methods together with the institution’s immediate community. Perhaps most importantly, RRC puts a spin on the fundamental question about the relevance of museums today, challenging the role museums and curators currently play in society."

This leads to the Dutch spotting “errors” in their subtitled television shows and films every now and then. Providing proper subtitles can be challenging when there are references involved that may be particularly related to a specific culture. In this thesis, the focus is the rendering of cultural intertextual references. Jan Pedersen offers an extensive overview of parameters that are crucial to subtitling and provides a foundation for decision-making. Even though the parameters interact and influence one another, the genre forms the core in the decision-making process, as humour and drama have different aims. The centrality and transculturality of a reference shows the importance of a reference in the source text. Then, the polysemiotic nature of subtitling and the co-text can guide in rendering the reference. Extratextuality determines to what extent a reference exists outside of the source text. Finally, media-specific constraints are a constant factor, which is a parameter that affects every aspect of subtitling and is not unique to the rendering of cultural intertextual references."

Researchers in geography and ecology have shown the importance of the topic yet the focus within new media studies is often on the possibilities of the devices and software instead. This shows a neglect of production processes that are often based in postcolonial and capitalist circumstances. The way we think and speak about digital devices impacts the material reality including production processes, energy use, waste disposal and human labour conditions. To understand how we value digital devices I conducted a critical discourse analysis based on Fairclough’s (1995, 2013) perspective originating from Marxist thought. This allows me to understand to what extent the way we value digital devices is interrelated with a capitalist system. Focusing on the micro practices that are visible on platforms that recommend certain laptops over others in critical discourse study, makes it possible to understand the macro structures these are dependent on. Micro covers the smaller practices and utterances that are based in macro power structures like a capitalist system. My understanding is that we all participate in a reproduction of valuation. The way we actively value and revalue and therefore treat digital devices impacts the whole system. My analysis shows that the main discourse in the Netherlands shows a very capitalist way of presenting devices. Its most powerful platforms naturalise abstract, short-term, end-user focused attributes such as speed, capacity and looks whereas production circumstances are not mentioned. Even ‘critical’ platforms that review selling platforms are heavily entrenched in a capitalist way of valuation. Counter-platforms do show more ethical values and fight for people, environment and sustainability. There is a big gap between these ways of valuation that seems impossible to align. We need big changes, discursive and material, in order to change the current system. This thesis shows in which ways powerful consumer-focused media currently do the opposite and maintain the capitalist system instead."

De Hogeschool van Amsterdam vroeg daarom het Centraal Instituut voor Toetsontwikkeling of er een toets ontwikkeld zou kunnen worden die de leesvaardigheid van hbo-studenten kan voorspellen aan de hand van hun academische woordenschat. Hierop werd door Cito de Toets Academische Taal (TAcT) ontwikkeld. In voorgaande onderzoeken is meermaals een sterk verband aangetoond tussen woordenschat en leesvaardigheid. In dit onderzoek is gekeken naar de academische woordenschatscores van hbo-studenten en wat de invloed van de scores is op de leesvaardigheid. Ook is gecontroleerd of moedertaal (Nederlands als moedertaal of tweede taal), leeftijd en vooropleiding invloed uitoefenen op de academische woordenschat en leesvaardigheid van hbo-studenten, omdat deze achtergrondkenmerken frequent genoemd worden in relatie tot taalvaardigheid. Voor het onderzoek maakten 242 studenten van de lerarenopleiding een pilotversie van de TAcT. De resultaten lieten een gematigde positieve correlatie zien tussen brede en diepe woordenschat. Daarnaast werd een zwakke positieve correlatie gevonden tussen brede woordenschat en leesvaardigheid en diepe woordenschat en leesvaardigheid. Proefpersonen met Nederlands als tweede taal scoorden significant lager op academische woordenschat en leesvaardigheid dan moedertaalsprekers. Bovendien bleek dat hoe hoger de vooropleiding en leeftijd van proefpersoon was, hoe hoger de gemiddelde score voor de TAcT. Op basis van de analyses kan worden geconcludeerd dat een hogere vocabulairekennis (breed dan wel diep) niet noodzakelijkerwijs leidt tot een beter tekstbegrip. De complexiteit van de teksten en de vraagstellingen kunnen hiervoor een verklaring zijn, maar ook de slechte interne consistentie van de leesvaardigheidsitems. De invloed van achtergrondkenmerken op de academische taalvaardigheid toont dat hogescholen bewuster zouden moeten kijken naar de eerstejaars hbo-student, met het doel om vroegtijdig de problemen met betrekking tot academische taalvaardigheid te constateren. De TAcT zal aan toekomstige gebruikers duidelijkheid verschaffen over zowel de academische woordenschat als de leesvaardigheid van eerstejaars hbo-studenten."

Dragon Age is a pseudo-mimetic text, that has to be understood in through the events of our own world. It reflects the conflicts as metaphorical representations of a world similar to our own. All elven characters (both the avatar and the non-player characters) are othered, placed in the position of the subaltern, and silenced in the retelling of history. The human population, with emphasis on Tevinter, Orlais, and the Chantry, are framed as the colonisers that have taken the elven land out of imperialistic views. Especially the assimilation of the elven into human society is framed by the Chantry as a civilising and ameliorating force, that actually forces the elves to become submissive to the hegemony of the ruling class. Any attempts to restore or regain heritage is difficult, as the colonisers have actively tried to erase it. This imbalance is echoed by the environment, in which the coloniser-colonised relationship is highlighted."

Mary Debrett vreest namelijk dat publieke streamingplatformen die buiten hun traditionele financiering om platformen financieren, zoals dat bij NPO Plus gebeurt, mogelijk een gevaar kunnen vormen voor het publieke imago van de publieke omroep. De krantenartikelen zijn onderzocht aan de hand van de methode zoals uiteengezet door mediahistorica Lynn Spigel. Uit analyse komt naar voren dat verschillende stakeholders met elkaar in discussie zijn of de dienst publiek of commercieel is. De NPO kwam met de meeste argumenten om haar dienst als publiek te positioneren en werd gesteund door staatssecretaris Sander Dekker, de NOS, en kranten de Volkskrant en AD. De critici, de VPRO, minister Slob en kranten De Telegraaf en NRC, kwamen ieder met verschillende eigen argumenten. Uit de analyse blijkt dat de NPO het behalen van één kerntaak (gevarieerde programmering) gebruikt om NPO Plus als publiek te positioneren, terwijl tegenstanders juist het niet behalen van een andere kerntaak (het aanspreken van een brede groep) gebruiken om de dienst als commercieel te beschouwen. Ook kwam uit de resultaten dat enkele critici de publieke waarde van de NPO in twijfel trokken door NPO Plus. Deze resultaten bevestigen Debretts vermoeden: dat betaalde streamingplatformen inderdaad een gevaar kunnen zijn voor het publieke imago van de publieke omroep."

I studied how the concept of mediatization unfolds in Tygron’s digital twin and what implication it has on the way the software represents the reality. Through applying the walkthrough as well as conducting a number of expert interviews I analysed the software’s interface and the experience of the users. In my research, I defined different user layers engaging with the software. Each of them has different objectives for using the tool and approaches the software with various levels of technical expertise. My research showed that the goal of the users as well as their data literacy influences the way the various groups perceive the results produced by the software."

The artists receive attention from a large online audience. Quite a number of them, however, encounter difficulties in finding and maintaining an offline audience that engages with their music. In scholarly literature, a common way to assess the differences in audiences is to measure the results of data analytics with respect to the audiences following an artist on social media and streaming services, and compare them with the results of the audiences showing up at club shows of a specific artist. This thesis shows that there is reason to doubt whether this assessment is appropriate. The thesis addresses a single case study, the Amsterdam based artists Indian Askin. The analysis of their online and offline activities offers insights into the ways in which digital engagement, that is measured via social media and streaming, is related to ‘real-life’ engagements of fans, measured mainly by ticket sales. The thesis concludes with suggestions to Indian Askin on how to encourage fans to interact and participate with the band as well as other members of the audience, with the goal of creating a larger, more loyal, dedicated and sustainable fan community."

To contribute to the analysis of soundtracks in environmental documentaries, this paper provides a close reading of Before the Flood (2016), An Inconvenient Truth (2006) and An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power (2017). The aim of this paper is to examine to what extent the soundtrack contributes to the narrative in documentaries about climate change. The case studies feature a dystopian storyline, which are often found in the genre of horror films. Therefore, this paper will also examine to what extent these documentaries incorporate horror conventions with regard to the function of their music and their placement in the narrative. The analyses are conducted by using theories from the current discourse on the study of environmental documentaries, the narrative role of soundtracks, horror conventions and immersion. The soundtracks and visuals of the case studies will be closely analyzed to determine the similarities and differences between the documentaries. I argue that the soundtracks in the case studies enhances the narrative and that horror conventions are used to trigger the viewer to reflect upon themselves."

Dit is belangrijk om te onderzoeken omdat er binnen de bestaande literatuur over musicals weinig onderzoek is gedaan naar de Nederlandse musical. Dit onderzoek laat aan de ene kant zien dat het wel degelijk nuttig is om de Nederlandse musical als onderzoeksobject te gebruiken en aan de andere kant dat een musical meer kan betekenen dan enkel entertainment. Door te kijken naar onderwerp, tekst en muziek van het nummer ‘Als wij niets doen’ uit Soldaat van Oranje heb ik onderzocht hoe deze een nationale identiteit creëert. De musical zelf heb ik vergeleken met andere Nederlandse musicals en de muziek met het nummer ‘Nieuwe Horizon’ uit de musical De Tweeling. Het analyseren van ‘Als wij niets doen’ in verschillende contexten laat zien dat de muziek voor meer doeleinden gebruikt kan worden dan alleen de musical. Soldaat van Oranje creëert door middel van verhaallijn en muziek een beeld over de Nederlandse geschiedenis dat een nationale identiteit vormt voor het publiek.

In courtroom narratives Wilczynski observed three different, gendered images of the child-murderer; women were seen as reacting in a feminine, irrational manner, which prompted courts to treat them leniently as 'sad' or 'mad'. Men, however, were depicted as acting rational and calculated, which branded them as 'bad'. Does this apply to the imaging of murdering fathers and mothers in the 71 Dutch cases? Particularly during a time period in which second wave feminism advocated equal rights and opportunities for men and women, and views on femininity and motherhood shifted. To research the question of how gender influences narratives around child-murderers in the courtroom and in newspaper coverage of cases in The Netherlands between 1960-1989, this thesis looks as various aspects. Such as the historically different treatment of men and women in the prosecution of crime and the influence of gender on legislation, the way gendered views work through crime news, and the influence of changing views of femininity in child-murder cases."
‘This is what a feminist looks like’: Measuring the Complexities of Fourth Wave Feminism through Fashion in a Transnational and Postfeminist Study,"['Meadows, B.R.']","['Trakilovic, M']",2020-09-02T18:00:58Z,en,[],Gender Studies,"The fashion industry is built upon the mass exploitation of people and planet. This human
exploitation disproportionally impacts on women, and those living in the majority world. Yet
fashion is also a tool of feminist empowerment, particularly in the current fourth wave which
is mainly orchestrated in social media spaces. Within the fourth-wave movement, however,
there is a disturbing lack of solidarity with garment workers. This in rooted in the colonialist
structures that divide our world and its people, and subsequently are mirrored in inequality of
the fashion industry. By the same token, the meaningful self-expression, self-love and
intersectional feminist possibilities created by fashion in its present form must be considered
too. These two points, the exploitation of one for the freedom of another, create a feminist
tension which this thesis is interested in. Moreover, it asks: how far can fourth wave feminist
interactions with the fashion industry be considered transnationally feminist, intersectionally
feminist, and postfeminist?

Using a robust theoretical framework of postfeminism, postcolonial and transnational
feminisms this research will trace and measure fourth wave interactions with the fashion
industry. Through semi-structured interviewing of three minority world feminists with varying
relationships to fashion, unpacking their lived experiences will produce a rich site of feminist
contradictions that both affirm and complicate the narratives that, to adopt the language of Dina
Siddiqi, “consuming bodies” in the minority world do not consider the violence underpinning
their relationship to “producing bodies” in the majority world. Overall, this thesis seeks to
complexify binary notions surrounding fashion and feminism to avoid resigning feminist
interactions with fashion as inherently bad (nor necessarily good). Instead through employing
Donna Haraway’s concept of staying with the trouble and dissecting the uncomfortable
relationship between the toxic fashion industry and fourth wave feminism the coexistence of
its empowering (yet selective) feminist potential against a landscape of capitalist, neocolonial
labour exploitation will become clear. It is only through realistically addressing what this
relationship looks like that we can begin to formulate a way out of it which, undoubtedly, is
desperately needed."
Double Trouble: Claiming Complex British-Iranian Womanhood Through Cultural Production,"['Dara, L.']","['Ftouni, L.']",2020-09-02T18:00:57Z,en,"['Hybridity, Authenticity, British-Iranian Women, Cultural Production,']",Gender Studies,"Cultural production holds the potential for the subversion of existing cultural matrices by offering alternative modes of being. For British-Iranian women, it offers a way to challenge ethnicised norms surrounding ‘Britishness’ that invisibilise and denigrate transcultural positionalities as Other. While existing scholarship on Iranian diasporic cultural production recognises its role as a site for the exploration of duality and belonging, the majority is insufficient in its attendance to the specificity of second-generation creative practitioners as
occupying a distinct hybrid ontological position. This thesis aims to demonstrate the subversive work of cultural production in a way that accounts for second-generation British-Iranian women’s ontological specificity and experience. Building from a recognition of the double
alienation British-Iranian women experience with regard both Iran and liberal feminism in the UK, it asks: How is cultural production utilised to navigate liminal positioning and advance a more complex notion of British-Iranian women’s transcultural agency?

Based on the critical tools of postcolonial hybridity and decolonial authenticity, this thesis analyses two contemporary cultural productions by second-generation British-Iranian women; the short film Taarof: A Verbal Dance, and the singles and music video from singer Farrah’s
upcoming album, ID. Using a combination of primarily visual analysis and discourse analysis, this research demonstrates how cultural production can be mobilised for the reclamation of complex agency, subverting binarised conceptualisations of womanhood that position British-Iranian women as either patriarchally complicit or liberal feminists. It also reveals the interconnectedness of hybridity and authenticity for an analysis of the ontological positioning of second-generation women, tools that cannot be stably separated but interact in the creation of transcultural modes of being. Further research is required to comprehensively probe the impact of ontologically hybrid authenticity on second-generation cultural production and its potential for the subversion of reductive, exclusionary approaches to belonging."

The perpetuation of exclusion and disregard for their basic access to land is often further enhanced by the post-conflict settings in which many land grabs occur. Leaving many without the formal channels to express their contentions. However, despite the odds pitted against them increasing numbers of landless people are resisting. Rural resistance has been relatively under-studied in comparison to the extensive literature on land grabbing. The literature that does exist is dominated by structural theories with little regard for the agency of the individual even in marginalised settings. Therefore, through the discussion on naked protests in Amuru District, northern Uganda, this thesis aims to provide insight into one particular case of rural resistance against land grabbing. Highlighting how naked protests have come to define resistance against land grabbing in Amuru District. This thesis will explore how processes of resistance against land grabs are highly complex and emotional processes. Requiring a shift to more emotional theories of resistance and social movement, which give value to the agent’s lived experience whilst acknowledging the role of local context. Through the discussion of naked protests in Amuru District, this thesis aims to contribute to the conversation of emotional theories of resistance, outlining its value for understanding the drivers of social movement and the creation of group solidarity."
Securitization and the discourse on migration in Poland.

Within a short time, it introduced several changes that altered Poland’s image at home and abroad. One of the first symptoms of Poland’s systemic change was its apathetic response towards the EU-wide resettlement scheme, following the migration crisis in 2015. Since then, PiS politicians have adopted a discourse that opposes immigration, in contravention of EU values and laws.
By examining discourse used by PiS politicians in Poland and among EU- audiences, the thesis attempts to discover how the government explains its migration policies in different environments. The main hypothesis this thesis assumes is that the two discourses vary in the methods used to securitize immigrants, the ways in which a constructivist identity is created, and the use of historical and social myths about Poland.
The topic analyzed in this paper is of academic importance as it sheds light on how discourse affects political action, and what role it plays in the international relations between state and organization (Poland and the European Union)."

I will argue that through this entanglement a cycle of inheritance of oppression and dehumanization is shown, and that ultimately, the trilogy as a whole makes an intervention in how we see the past, and how we might reconcile with it in hope to make a better future. In the first chapter of the analysis, I will show the entanglement of exploitative capitalism and colonialism and its oppressive and dehumanizing forces as portrayed in these novels. In the second chapter I will argue that this entanglement is intrinsically linked to the natural world through the concept of magic as portrayed in these novels, and that this leads to the dehumanization of nature as a whole, with natural disasters as a consequence. In the last chapter I will argue that this entanglement of capitalism, colonialism and the natural world is inherited by those who are marginalized and dehumanized through their cyborgian transgressions.

A study of the influence of English proficiency level on Chinese students’ performance regarding politeness--taking the speech act of refusal as an example","['Zhang, X.']","['Pinto, Manuela']",2020-09-02T18:01:02Z,en_US,['Politeness theory; face; speech act of refusal'],Interculturele communicatie,"Politeness theory is well-known in both the fields of communication and linguistics. It was first proposed by Brown and Levinson in 1987 and it has been heatedly discussed by researchers since its initial presentation. The core and base of politeness theory lies in the desire to maintain face. Speaking of face in communication, China cannot be neglected. According to Ho (1975, p. 867), the origin of the word ""face"" is a Chinese idea referring to the use of ""mianzi面子"" or ""lian脸"". The Chinese are famous for their obsession with saving face (爱面子).
Moreover, beginning with the opening-up policy in the late 1980s and its entrance into the WTO, China became more engaged in global affairs. Historically, the importance of learning English has been stressed by all Chinese and in recent decades this has been emphasized even more. Considering these two facts, one may wonder whether the Chinese traditions regarding face and politeness will remain the same under the drastic lash of English language usage?
This study was designed find out how does the English proficiency level of Chinese students affects their way of refusing. To insure the validity of participants’ English level, the C-test was designed as part of the survey. The C-test is a method for detecting the real language proficiency level proven to be well-established in linguistics. After finishing the English C-test, participants were asked to complete the Discourse Completion Task to determine their first and most real refusal response to an interaction in a social setting. 
The results of this study did not show any significant correlation between English proficiency level and the refusal strategy the respondents chose. However, the current study has found several interesting phenomena that are typical of Chinese users of English. These include not willing to refuse people who are more powerful and initiating a “ritual acceptance” to mitigate the tone of refusal. In conclusion, although English language usage does not change Chinese students’ codes of conducts and politeness, preferences for refusal strategies are related to culture and thus politeness is not proven to be universal."

This BA thesis explores whether language attitudes could be a useful aid for translators in helping them select a suitable variety in the target language when confronted with a non-standard language variety in the source text. Language attitudes towards texts in Scottish English with translations thereof in four Dutch translations – Standard Dutch, The Hague lower class dialect, Town Frisian and Limburgish – were compared on dimensions of status, competence, integrity, dynamics, and beauty. Results show that Town Frisian is most like Scottish English and could therefore be regarded as a suitable translation variety for texts written in Scottish English. The determination of one variety as the most suitable translation variety supports the idea that language attitudes may be used to help translators find suitable translation varieties when confronted with non-standard varieties. The results are discussed with reference to dialectological sociolinguistics and the current translation studies’ attitude to dialects. Further research could expand on this explorative research by looking at language attitudes towards spoken versus written language and comparing varieties of different languages in neutral text."

Analysing the circumstances of safer spaces and what they tell us about normative, western art education, this thesis considers how dominant notions of pedagogical value are being queered in a safer space. Building on theories of Queer pedagogy, Critical pedagogy (as put forth by Paulo Freire), heterotopias (as put forth by Michel Foucault), critical reflection and action or praxis (as put forth by Paulo Freire) and institutional whiteness (as put forth by Sara Ahmed), this thesis testifies to the subversive pedagogical potential of safer spaces and honours BIPOC students addressing oppressive normativities within an educational institution. This thesis focuses on two case studies of student-based safer spaces and their efforts to reflect on, critique and change their institutional surroundings, as well as the institutional response to these spaces. The research analysis involves two close-readings of interviews with organisers of safer spaces within the School of Arts in Utrecht, and illuminates how BIPOC organisers and participants have had to deal with institutional whiteness, institutional racism and institutional deflection by teachers and staff members as representatives of the institution. In conclusion, this thesis holds space for (BIPOC) students and their embodied knowledges - voices that are systematically oppressed - and can be considered an effort towards more research concerning institutional whiteness or the effects of institutional whiteness on (art) education, as well as the broader spectrum of (the potential of) safer space."

This thesis explores the concept of an ecosystem to understand international collaboration between arts organisations using Arts Collaboratory as a case study. Ecosystems are understood as an interconnected web of communities placing relationality at the core of this thesis. Relationality also enables the study of the connections between human and non-human actors. Space, knowledge and dependency materialise as interrelated concepts that act as axis to guide the discussion. A key feature of Arts Collaboratory is that the majority of the organisations are located in the global South, influencing the type of literature consulted as part of the analysis. Insights on the practices of Arts Collaboratory is placed in dialogue with theory related the three concepts, which demonstrated the relevance of these concepts within the overarching lens of the ecosystem. Space as a frame, is used to understand the space between organisations, how this relates to the binary position of the global South but also how space is created at a local level. Knowledge is deconstructed from a decolonial perspective. The ecosystem model facilitates the multiplicity of knowledges and situated knowledges. Dependency leads to understanding the ties to resources, especially funding, and the tensions that can be created in adopting characteristics of ecosystem model of being self-organised the potential reproduction of colonial relations that need to be considered in international collaboration of arts organisations. Combined with these additional concepts, the ecosystem lens is productive to think with to understand international collaborations."

The role of the internet for terrorism is often, but incorrectly, perceived as a static one without progress. This thesis however emphasises the historical development of the internet by analysing how the internet was used by terrorists in three technological phases of the web. Each Web phase is studied using a detailed qualitative approach in which the online activities of individual members of a terrorist network are examined. The networks selected for this analysis are the Dutch Hofstad Network, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and the fluid network of far-right terrorists. The careful choice for each of these networks is based on their active use of the respective technological phase of the internet. The analysisshows that on the one hand, shifts in the type of content and used platforms can be distinguished over the years. Additionally, an increase in the sophistication of online activities of terrorists and the importance of online communities can be seen. On the other hand, the online activities were merely an expansion to the offline activities of terrorists, as they could not replace the physical violence that is essential to terrorism. This online expansion did however further increase the (potential) audience of terrorists and decrease the importance of ideology"

Binnen televisieonderzoek is representatie van vrouwen een veel besproken onderwerp, echter, in de literatuur is weinig onderzoek verricht naar de representatie van vrouwelijke personages in komedieseries met vrouwelijke makers. Volgens onderzoekers wordt komedie namelijk gebruikt om feministische ideeën te aan te kaarten en bovendien worden schadelijke representaties van gender, seksualiteit en etniciteit bekritiseerd door gebruik van satire.  Deze drie identiteits-assen worden samen onderzocht omdat binnen genderstudies intersectioneel onderzoek volgens Crenshaw gewenst is.  Om inzicht de krijgen in de representatie van gender, seksualiteit en etniciteit wordt specifiek gelet op televisiecodes, zoals beschreven door Fiske.  De sociale, narratieve en technische codes van Fiske zijn voor dit onderzoek aangepast waarbij Instagram als extra technische code dient. Verder wordt gekeken naar relationele representatie volgens Meyer.  Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat satire in Broad City eerder patriarchale structuren bekritiseert in plaats van stereotypen van etnische minderheden, lhbtq’s of vrouwen doorbreekt. Hoewel Broad City patriarchale structuren en traditionele vrouwelijkheid bekritiseert door het gebruik van feministische en post-feministische humor bij de representatie van gender en seksualiteit, zijn niet op datzelfde niveau taboedoorbrekende representaties van etniciteit of etnische humor aanwezig. Bovendien zijn schadelijke representaties van biseksualiteit aanwezig.  Tot slot blijkt dat positieve Othering wordt geconstrueerd middels de Instagramcodes."

Numerous studies have shown that the first language has a strong influence on the second language, however few studies have analysed the influence of the second language on the first because of the daily immersion in L2 culture. This research thesis aims to examine whether the exposure to a foreign language and culture has an impact on the perception and expression of emotions in bilinguals. The research investigates whether there are effective differences between the expression of emotions in Italian of Italian bilinguals with English as L2 and Italian monolinguals. Building on existing work on bilingualism and emotions, it asks: To what extent does the use of a second language influence directness in the expression and the perception of emotions in the first language? In this context, bilingual is defined as a speaker who uses L2 for professional purposes on a daily basis whose country of residence is a country where L2 is spoken. Based on a review of the literature on expression and perception of emotions in the first and second language, an online qualitative questionnaire was distributed to 36 students: respondents were divided into two groups, in the first one there were 18 Italian monolinguals students from University of Bari, and in the second group there were 18 Italian bilinguals students who speak English as second language from Utrecht University. Analysis of the responses demonstrated that the daily use of English has a strong impact on the expression of emotions in the bilinguals with regard to lexicon and discourse markers. In spite of that, results indicate that English does not have a profound effect on the perception of emotions in the bilinguals. Further research is needed to identify differences and similarities in the expression and perception of emotions in English-Italian bilinguals and English monolinguals and to determine whether there is a common semantic structure for the perception and expression of emotions that is shared between these two languages."

In dit onderzoek wordt – aan de hand van een kritische discoursanalyse – duidelijk hoe de representatie van de Other in het Globale Zuiden, door en ten opzichte van de westerse beroemdheid in NGO-campagnes, zich over een tijdspanne van ruim dertig jaar heeft ontwikkeld. De historische vergelijking wordt getrokken tussen beelden uit de periode van Audrey Hepburn als ambassadrice voor Unicef (1988-1992) en recente beelden met Gigi Hadid als nieuwste aanwinst van de organisatie (2019). Uit de analyse is gebleken dat het discours rondom de Other in de periode van Hepburn een overwegend negatieve lading heeft. De hedendaagse representatie van de Other in het Globale Zuiden markeert echter duidelijke verschillen: in tegenstelling tot ruim dertig jaar geleden, wordt de nadruk in recente beeldvorming voornamelijk gelegd op de (individuele) vooruitgang van de Ander in het Globale Zuiden. Ondanks de verschuiving van negatieve naar positievere appeals, kan geconcludeerd worden dat de beelden nog altijd stereotypen bevatten die een racistisch regime van representatie (Hall, 1997) laten voortbestaan."

These include motivations for language variation such as genre appropriateness, acts of identity, audience and referee design, and discourse-based motivations based on topic and mode."

In this thesis, I start with an acknowledgement of both the promises and pitfalls of lives lived in an open relationship to form—liberated from normative ideas about what a life should or can be, but precarized by the techniques of neoliberal governance—and investigate the potential of dance improvisation in relation to negotiating the conditions of collective ongoingness in the face of material and epistemological uncertainty. To do so, I begin by mapping a critical discourse within dance studies which problematizes the ideological trappings of contemporary dance improvisation, framing dance improvisation as a biopolitical mode of subjection. Normative understandings of movement, essence, and therapy cast dance improvisation as a field which is, according to the biopolitical critique, not yet an adequate site of support for collective ongoingness. However, by showing that the clusters of concepts which define dance improvisation as an ideological assemblage take on alternative meanings in other fields, I demonstrate a certain flexibility within dance improvisation. Acknowledging and enacting this conceptual flexibility frames dance improvisation not only as a possible source of support for the complex challenges of the present, but indeed as an object with the potential to continue to adapt to the critical demands of the future."

reaction against intervention in the 1990s, spurred to action those who wanted to protect civilians
while respecting sovereignty. In 1999 African leaders decided to form the African Union, proactive
in responding to threats to civilians, to prevent a recurrence of an atrocity akin to the Rwandan
genocide. The organization had the power to intervene to protect civilians when atrocities
loomed. Many Africans could not abide by the idea of the West and former colonial powers
coming to their aid. The Union was an attempt to create an African solution to the problem of
civilian protection. In 2005, all United Nations member states agreed to a norm on the
responsibility to protect civilians, comparable to the African predecessor. Changing attitudes is
not a straightforward task, and much work is required still to prioritize protecting civilians over
safeguarding sovereignty. The role of the African Union in the development of norms on civilian
protection is under-researched, and the goal of this thesis is to address this gap in knowledge
with a historical account of norms about civilian protection based on primary sources from the
Union itself. This thesis utilizes social-constructivist theories of norms to analyze the historical
development of norms on protecting civilians from 1990-2005. The conflict in the Darfur region
in Sudan in 2003-2004 provides a case study that concerns norm development in an African
context permitting analysis of the African Union response. This thesis aims to connect research
on norm development regarding civilian protection in the African Union with such study in a
global context."

De graaf van den Bergh kon zich namelijk tot de aanzienlijkste adel van Gelre rekenen en had een belangrijke positie in het hertogdom. Bergh lag bovendien op een strategische plaats doordat het grensde aan het hertogdom Kleef, dat het grootste deel van de oorlog tegen Gelre vocht. De graaf was daardoor direct bij de oorlogssituatie betrokken. De situatie was bovendien diplomatiek uitdagend omdat de graaf van den Bergh zowel verplichtingen had aan Gelre als aan Habsburg. Een belangrijk element in dit onderzoek is daarom de houding die de graaf jegens de vorst aannam, teneinde zich in de complexe situatie staande te kunnen houden, en hoe die houding in de loop der tijd veranderde."

Today, the innovative and controversial process of love enhancement, namely the ability to enhance or block sentiments of love in a person’s brain, through the use of psychopharmaceuticals, is being greatly disputed, establishing it as one of the most interesting and, at the same time, ambiguous ethical topics to be discussed. While the mere practical procedure is still in its earlier developmental stages, making it quite hard to envision a future in which such love drugs are being implemented, it is still quite important to understand the claims and the ideas that are being proposed by both those who are strictly against or greatly support this practice. This means also analyzing the supposed cases in which these enhancers would be consumed, without the need to necessarily form an opinion on the matter, as the process of love enhancement can spark a further discussion on important philosophical and ethical concepts, such as well-being, mental capacity, intrinsic value and different accounts of morality."
Ante-Mortem and Post-Mortem Conundrums: An Ethical Analysis of the Pitcher-Feinberg Approach,"['Caramori Rossi, V.']","['Peters, Mathijs']",2020-09-03T18:00:10Z,en,[],Applied Ethics,"Is the Pitcher-Feinberg approach in defence of posthumous harm convincing, when applied to ethical theory and practical cases of supposed harm against the dead? Because of semantic issues, the debate about the treatment of the dead can be quite unclear. However, one critique against the Pitcher-Feinberg approach proves to be one of the most influential inside of the debate: Joan Callahan's theory. In this thesis I will defend the Pitcher-Feinberg approach against her critiques, by showing that her counterarguments have fallacies both from a theoretical viewpoint, and a practical viewpoint. The Pitcher-Feinberg approach has one main problem: its formulation can be quite vague. However, if we introduce the additional notions of autonomy, informed consent, and dignity (which are mainly used as a moral basis for the justice system, when debating the rights of the dead), we will see that these can corroborate the approach. Finally, I will test the Pitcher-Feinberg approach by applying it to four real life cases of posthumous harm: (a) Body Worlds and Bodies: the Exhibition, (b) the Negro of Banyoles, (c) Doris Stauffer and (d) Jennifer Gable. Confronting the approach, through the help of the additional notions aforementioned, with these four real life cases, shows that the Pitcher-Feinberg approach is consistent both with ethical theory and practical cases of posthumous harm."

In Nederland wonen veel kinderen in de basisschoolleeftijd die nog maar kort in Nederland verblijven, en het Nederlands onvoldoende beheersen om mee te kunnen draaien in het regulier basisonderwijs. Deze nieuwkomers vallen echter wel onder de Nederlandse leerplicht, en ontvangen daarom vaak aangepast onderwijs. Dit onderwijs kan de vorm aannemen van een nieuwkomersschool, waar uitsluitend onderwijs aan deze doelgroep wordt gegeven. Op dergelijke scholen is goede monitoring en toetsing van groot belang. Met name op het gebied van woordenschat is dit cruciaal, omdat woordkennis een belangrijke voorspeller is van latere leesvaardigheid en algemeen schoolsucces.
Het nieuwkomersonderwijs kent echter een groot gebrek aan geschikte woordenschattoetsen. Om dichter bij de realisatie van een geschikte woordenschattoets voor nieuwkomers in het onderwijs te komen, is een tweedelig onderzoek uitgevoerd. Ten eerste is een exploratie van het werkveld en de behoeften die daarin leven gedaan, door middel van semi-gestructureerde interviews met deskundigen op het gebied van nieuwkomersonderwijs. De belangrijkste bevindingen waren, onder andere, dat er vooral behoefte is aan een toets die de groei van de woordenschat van de kinderen kan meten, die methodeonafhankelijk is, en een norm heeft die realistisch is voor de doelgroep. Ten tweede is een experiment uitgevoerd om te onderzoeken welke effecten het heeft wanneer er met twee verschillende methoden wordt getoetst. Dit is uitgevoerd door de scores van nieuwkomers in het basisonderwijs op twee verschillende toetsen met elkaar zijn vergelijken, en te onderzoeken of deze door dezelfde factoren worden beïnvloed. Hieruit zijn geen verschillen tussen de resultaten op de twee typen toetsen naar voren gekomen, maar verder onderzoek waarin meer factoren worden meegenomen is nodig.
De resultaten van beide delen van dit onderzoek worden besproken in het licht van literatuur over de woordenschatontwikkeling van nieuwkomers en toetsing. Tot slot komen beide delen samen in een lijst met concluderende aanbevelingen voor toetsontwikkelaars. Hiermee ligt de weg open voor concrete stappen naar de ontwikkeling van een passende woordenschattoets voor nieuwkomers in het basisonderwijs."

Hetzelfde type (dus beide zelfstandige naamwoorden of beide bijvoeglijke naamwoorden) zoals ‘peper en zout’, ‘mooie en grote’ en ‘melk en suiker’ (Molin, 2014). In dit verslag wordt gerapporteerd over het verschijnsel: de volgorde van binomiale constructies met eigennamen in het Nederlands. Dit wordt onderzocht aan de hand van de theorie van Mollin (2014) die in het Engels het verschijnsel van de volgorde van BCs. Mollin (2014) heeft zich in haar corpusonderzoek gebaseerd op de theorie van Benor & Levy (2006) die achttien beperkingen hebben opgesteld die de volgorde van een BC zou kunnen bepalen. Deze beperkingen zijn door Mollin (2014) getoetst op de 544 meest voorkomende BCs in het Engels. Er wordt een onderscheidt gemaakt tussen semantische, metrisch-fonologische en niet-metrisch fonologische beperkingen. Uit haar resultaten blijkt dat de semantische beperkingen, iconiciteit, perceptuele gemarkeerdheid, formele gemarkeerdheid en sterkte het sterkst de volgorde bepalen. Daarna hebben de metrisch-fonologische beperkingen, het aantal syllabes, het vermijden van lapse en het vermijden van eindklemtoon de meeste invloed en als laatste de niet-metrisch-fonologische beperkingen, syllabegewicht, vocaallengte, syllabe openheid en het vocaal naar achteren. 
Met behulp van de theorie die Mollin (2014) heeft opgesteld, heb ik onderzoek gedaan naar de volgorde van BCs met eigennamen in het Nederlands. De onderzoeksvraag die centraal staat in dit onderzoek is: welk samenspel van beperking bepaalt de volgorde van BCs met eigennamen in het Nederlands?
Deze onderzoeksvraag is onderzocht door middel van een online vragenlijst. Door gebruik te maken van een vragenlijst, en dus gecontroleerd data te verzamelen, is het mogelijk om beperkingen die in de literatuur is vastgesteld over BCs apart te testen voor het Nederlands (Schütze. 2016:162). In totaal zijn er 18 vragen in de vragenlijst. Vier vragen zijn vragen aan de hand van een verhaaltje en de 12 andere vragen hebben twee verschillende antwoordmogelijkheden waarbij twee namencombinaties gegeven worden. Van elke beperking zijn twee testitems gemaakt om idiosyncratische problemen met een testitem te minimaliseren (Schütze 2016:180-181). Wanneer alle resultaten binnen zijn gekomen, is er voor elke namencombinatie een binomiale toets uitgevoerd met als uitgangsgemiddelde 50%, wat ook het uitgangspunt van Mollin (2014) was in haar eigen onderzoek. 
Voor alle beperkingen, behalve perceptuele gemarkeerdheid, is er een meerderheid gevonden voor de voorspelde volgorde per beperking. De volgende beperkingen hebben significant aangetoond dat deze van toepassing zijn op het bepalen van de volgorde van BCs van eigennamen in het Nederlands: iconiciteit, sterkte en het vermijden van de eindklemtoon. Van de rest van de beperkingen kunnen we niet met zekerheid concluderen of deze significant van toepassing zijn omdat alleen één testitem van de twee significantie aantoonde of helemaal geen."

temporal parochialism and geographical cosmopolitanism. In chapter 2, I will decide to deepen his
theoretical framework considering Harvey’s theory of time-space compression2 and Rosa’s
theorisation of social acceleration3. This will help me in inscribing temporal parochialism and
geographical cosmopolitanism in a broader and more comprehensive sociological framework. In
chapter 3, I will firstly point out a critic Heath moved against Rosa, to investigate the
methodological limits of social critical theory. Secondly, I will investigate the influence of an
instrumental view over what I will define our environmental moral sensitivity, to finally rethink
entirely temporal parochialism and geographical cosmopolitanism renaming them temporal
instrumentalism and spatial domination. In light of this analysis, I will normatively conclude that an
intrinsic valorisation and enhancement of nature is more desirable to strengthen our environmental
moral sensitivity and make us more motivated to fight climate change, than an instrumental
approach towards nature."

It was called “The Great East Japan Earthquake,” and the ensuing tsunami struck the nuclear power plants in Fukushima. It led the worst nuclear disaster in the world
after Chernobyl and collectively resulted in 18,500 dead and missing as well as 160,000 evacuees.

Despite the massive and continuous radiation release in the ocean and in the air for more than nine years, the Japanese government has not taken any definitive measures to alleviate the crisis and has instead deployed various dominant discourses and rhetorics, that downplayed and minimized the radiation risk and led to the emergence of widely divergent risk perceptions among the local population.

This thesis aims to understand how these dominant discourses influenced people’s diverse risk perceptions by applying “de-securitization” as a main analytical frame. In other words, this thesis focuses on the interactive process between the “de-securitizing actors’ speech acts” and “audience.” Through this research, I propose three categories of the dominant discourses in post-Fukushima Japan: 1) “the safe discourses,” 2) “the counter-discourses,” and 3) “the cutting discourses.” Furthermore, by applying three more sub-concepts, “media control,” “denialism,” and “intersubjectivity of active audience,” I generated the model of the “de-securitization” process in the post-Fukushima situation."

Mijn hypothese is de verwachting dat vertaalprogramma’s niet in staat zijn een juiste vertaling te geven, omdat ze geen bepaalde functies bezitten voor het handhaven van pragmatische regels. Mijn doelstelling is duidelijk maken dat een vertaling met een programma niet altijd correct is vanwege pragmatische eigenschappen van talen. Om het antwoord op deze vraag te onderzoeken, heb ik de theorieën van Hall, Hofstede en Lewis met elkaar vergeleken. De theorie van Hall levert een belangrijke bijdrage over de verschillen tussen de Nederlandse en de Italiaanse cultuur. In deze theorie wordt gezegd dat Nederlanders een lage context gewend zijn, dus boodschappen explicieter overbrengen en directer zijn in de communicatie. Italianen zijn een hoge context gewend en communiceren boodschappen dus impliciet en minder direct. Ik heb in mijn onderzoek de communicatiestijlen van de Nederlandse en de Italiaanse cultuur onderzocht. Dit heb ik gedaan door een aantal sociale situaties aan een groep Nederlanders en een groep Italianen voor te leggen, waar zij op moesten reageren. Deze reacties heb ik vervolgens met het vertaalprogramma DeepL vertaald. Zo heb ik ook de pragmatische competenties van het programma onderzocht tijdens zijn vertaling. Het voornaamste resultaat gebaseerd op de theorie en mijn eigen bevindingen is dat er een verschil in communicatiestijl tussen de Nederlandse en de Italiaanse cultuur zit. De Italiaanse participanten vinden de Nederlandse reacties in sociale situaties vaak te direct en de Nederlanders vinden de Italiaanse reacties soms te indirect. Door mijn onderzoek is naar voren gekomen dat een vertaalprogramma geen pragmatische competenties bezit en er kan geconcludeerd worden dat het geen rekening houdt met het verschil in communicatiestijl bij zijn vertaling en dat het daarom ongeschikt zal zijn voor de vertaling van de communicatie tussen twee mensen uit verschillende culturen."

This study therefore investigated whether the speech related items of the Thought and Language Dysfunction Scale (TALD) corresponded with automatically measured features of the acoustic speech signal. Spontaneous speech of patients with schizophrenia (n=42) as well as healthy controls (n=42) was analysed using acoustic speech analysis software programs for 11 speech parameters. Results showed that, in comparison to healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia spoke softer, had a higher F1 frequency, made longer pauses, varied less in speech volume, had more shimmer, spoke a smaller percentage of the time and had a slower speech rate. However, no significant differences were found between patients with severe FTD and patients with less severe FTD. The sensitivity of the TALD was assessed by analysing the correlation between five speech related items on the scale and their associated speech parameters. Only two out of five items of the TALD correlated significantly with their associated speech parameter, suggesting the TALD is an inaccurate clinical tool with regards to speech related anomalies."

The difficulty of defining the invisible shackles inspires me to present stories and interpretations of litereture to articulate an understanding of how invisible shackles might take form in Egyptian society. To be more specific, invisible shackles are the unfavorable socio-economic patriarchal circumstances which lead women to imprisonment. I want to avoid reading these shackles as a specific quantifiable set of factors or circumstances that would seek to explain why such women go to prison, for fear that such a reading would be reductive.

One way in which the Netherlands does this is through allowing people to seek refuge in the Netherlands on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The IND (Immigration and Naturalisation Service) has created a document that the IND employees can use as a direction for interviewing a person about the credibility of their sexuality or gender identity. While the IND claims to be an ‘open organisation’ (IND, n.d.) because it has published these work instructions online, the work instructions actually conceal certain hierarchical power dynamics between the IND and the person seeking asylum. In this thesis, I analyse how the IND work instructions as part of the LGBT asylum procedure enact a homonationalist discourse. By conducting a discourse analysis of the IND work instructions I show that there is an ideology of objectivity at the basis of this document. This ideology of objectivity constructs the IND’s position as innocent and the person seeking asylum as biased and subjective. The construction of a position of innocence through an ideology of objectivity form the conditions for the creation of a Subaltern position. In addition to this, the desire for innocence and objectivity enforce a homonationalist dynamic, in which the Self (the Netherlands) is represented as tolerant and progressive, while the Other (the countries that the people seeking asylum come from) is constructed as backwards and oppressive. This is a process of othering in which the Netherlands differentiates itself from the (often Islamic, Eastern European and/or black) Other through the temporary acceptance of certain homosexual bodies into the nationalist imaginary. This process is what Jasbir Puar calls homonationalism. I argue that the desire for objectivity and innocence that cause me to interpret the LGBT asylum procedure as a homonationalist structure, is a significant part of the reason why the IND reject many of the people seeking asylum on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity."

A year after performing at Coachella, she had all music journalism centered on her again by releasing a concert-documentary, named  Homecoming . This film not only shows her live performance but also reveals an inside-look at the production-process behind it. As a film directed by Beyoncé herself and released by her management, it deserves a critical look concerning its message construction and agenda. There are already extensive works written about her with regards to postcolonial, gender and marketing studies. Hence this case study will be used to study Beyoncé from a new media and performance study perspective. Therefore, this research sets out to explore the use of dramaturgical strategies in  Homecoming to historicize Beyoncé's star identity. It explores how Beyoncé's star identity is built on the visual world she creates and therefore argues that her star identity becomes a spectacle , a term coined by Debord. The  spectacle of  Homecoming employs internal focalizers and a performative voice to position the spectator to view Beyoncé in a larger, historical perspective.

A PROOF OF CONCEPT REMOTE SENSING METHOD FOR ASSESSING FOREST RESTORATION: A case study in the Dui-Sutpeh-Pui National Park in Thailand,"['Ouwehand, M.']","['Ricker, B.']",2020-09-04T18:00:19Z,en,"['Remote Sensing, Forest restoration, Google Earth Engine, Casestudy, Indicators']",Liberal Arts and Sciences,"In the last century, the earth has lost almost half of its original forest cover. A problematic development, as forests are essential to maintain life of earth.  There is urgent need for finding the best solutions to restore these forests. This research aimed to contribute to this need, by proofing a remote sensing method assessing forest restoration in Google Earth Engine. The Dui-Suthep-Pui National Park in Thailand was taken as a case study to illustrate and evaluate this RS method. The method consists of three indicators: Tree Canopy Cover measuring forest density, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Net Primary Production both measuring forest health. This triangulation of indicators was found to give a robust image changes in the forest over time, enabling to assess forest restoration. Google Earth Engine was found as an useful platform, because it stores RS products to measure the indicators. The RS method can be used to measure different restoration efforts, to identify which approach works best for restoring forests. Moreover, small communities or projects are enabled to do their own research without intervention of an instate, sharing bottom-up knowledge."
"Mumbling, Shouting, and Singing: Listening to the (Non)Human Voice in Trap","['Langejan, E.H.']","['Kamp, M.']",2020-09-04T18:00:25Z,en_US,"['Trap music, the sonic color line, sonic blackness, musicology, human voice, nonhuman voice, posthuman voice, black posthumanism, hip hop']",Musicology,"Since the 1990s, trap has increasingly influenced mainstream popular music. The Southern-American genre is notorious for its “trap-beat” as well as a vocal style that is often derogatorily referred to as mumble-rap or mushmouth rap. This vocal style is characterized by the murmured lyrical delivery causing a high level of unintelligibility. Different from mainstream post-race hip hop—which Justin Burton classifies as clearly pronounced, politically engaged hip hop performed by artists such as Kendrick Lamar—trap lyricism rarely involves anything other than money, promiscuity, and excessive lifestyles. Moreover, typical trap music uses a fair amount of expressive exclamations and ad libs, for instance, the “choppa” sound: brrrah!, where the rattling r’s imitate the sound of an automatic firearm, adding to a violent and noisy sound experience for a mainstream audience that has become used to post-race hip hop (Burton 2017). 	
	The perceived sonic blackness (Eidsheim 2011) in trap, which is the perceived black body in sound, urges questions about the way in which the voice can be rendered less-than-human, or even nonhuman. The sonic palette of trap deliberately invites a listening experience of blackness by making use of the sonic color line, which refers to sounds that are racialized by the listening ear in the historic context of segregation, slavery, and othering (Stoever 2016). The racialization of sound is rooted into socially constructed ideas about the use of the voice, which has traditionally divided vowels and consonants, sounds and noises, as well as language and gibberish into the hierarchical binary of human and nonhuman (Connor 2014, Weheliye 2002). This binary has traditionally rendered people who deviate from the white patriarchal norm as less-than-human in an intersectional way. The perceived sonic blackness in trap is thus a perception of trap’s sounds as noisy, aggressive, and threatening, which are notions that are rooted in stereotypes about a specific blackness related to the American South. I argue that trap’s centralization of the voice, and subsequently the (black) body creates a listening experience of that body that is both threatening and direct. This leads me to argue that trap voices create a grotesque version of the black body that is connected to the stereotypical associations about the black, hypersexual, male identity, and a parody of that. Ultimately I argue that trap vocals transgress the human/nonhuman binary, and in doing so offer a specifically southern perspective to black posthumanism."

Corbet has become largely forgotten since his death and very little literature concerning his life has ever been published.
My primary aim was therefore to assemble the first extensive biography of the painter, whilst undertaking a more in-depth analysis of his work than has yet been attempted. This involved bringing together the small amount written about him, whilst adding to this with information found in my own research in archive centres in Shrewsbury, the town where he spent much of his career. The list of primary sources read includes a number of letters written by the painter himself.
The paper’s theoretical approach, its visual analysis, approached his work by creating links between Corbet’s paintings and certain seventeenth-century Dutch painters, as well as his British predecessors and contemporaries. The Dutch influence evident in some of his work is rare in this period of his British art, marking him out as a more notable figure than his current reputation would suggest.
The resulting paper is one that surpasses any other piece of writing on the painter in terms of its depths. The biography is more detailed than any other written,but different periods of his life vary in the amount of source material and thus vary in detail. Much of time in Shrewsbury is well covered, for example, whilst his early and later years require further research.
The analysis of his paintings was limited by the limited number of examples of his work available to view, but I have managed to add to this list to the extent that the hallmarks of his style and methods can be detected. The visual analysis will suggest that Corbet’s engagement with Dutch painting peaked in the late 1820s, but that his interest in the period was maintained throughout his life."

The idea of the existence of a ""shared fate"" between the Italian and German processes of national unification in Italian public discourse (1848-1871)","['Lissi, S.']","['Pekelder, J.']",2020-09-04T18:00:25Z,en_US,['History of Ideas; History of Italy; Risorgimento; Romantic Nationalism; Italo-German Relations; Nationalisms in Transnational Perspective'],History,"What does it take for two political entities to consider themselves allies? Usually two elements are 
required: shared interests and a shared enemy. Many among the ranks of the Italian national 
movement felt between 1848 and 1871 that the German and Italian national causes possessed both of 
them. It was believed that both nationalities aimed at the unification of their respective countries and 
were both being obstructed in this by the Habsburg Empire. Consequently, a “shared fate” was 
envisioned for the two nationalities: Germans and Italians were “natural allies” and were destined to 
forge their national unifications together by collaborating against the Habsburgs. Such an idea of a 
fundamental commonality of destinies between the two national causes experienced a widespread 
diffusion in the discourse of the Risorgimento, often also entering the political vocabulary of official 
relations between the two nationalities. Historiography has however until now often overlooked this 
idea, taking its existence mostly for granted and leaving the idea itself, its cultural origins, and its 
diffusion unproblematized. This thesis analyzes how such a concept, which could be considered as 
the product of early 19th century historicism and romantic nationalism, entered the political 
vocabulary of the Italian national movement and was used to foster political action. Using the history 
of ideas’ framework, along with a contextualist approach, this thesis not only sheds new light on an 
important episode of the history of relations between the Italian and German world, but also provides 
a powerful portrait of the element of transnationality of the Italian Risorgimento in the European 
scenario."

This narrative carried on into the beginning  of the nineteenth century, but then something interesting happens: the image begins to take on a different shape, slowly changing into a wholly different narrative.  Today, very few historians still treat Alexander VI as a conglomerate of human sins: he is more often praised for his political conduct and his pontificate’s diplomacy. Why did this change in the nineteenth century? This shift in historiography has been pointed out by some historians, yet few have offered a satisfying explanation for it. This paper offers an explanation, then, by researching the historiography of Alexander VI between the mid-nineteenth and mid-twentieth century. It traces a selection of authors chronologically, from Leopold von Ranke to Orestes Ferrara. The factors of time, confession, nationality and genre are vital criteria here, and are used so we may understand what caused these authors to arrive to their tale of Alexander VI – ultimately resulting in a change of narrative on the Renaissance pope."

Brubakers (2012) idea’s for useful research of nationalism and religion are used to research whether Protestantism was positively or negatively related to nationalism and anticolonialism and to what extent it can explain the existence, growth and power of Korean nationalism. This thesis distinguishes different groups in the Protestant landscape of religious Korea: the missionaries, the Korean Protestants, the Protestant intellectuals and the overseas Korean intellectuals. Findings include a complex entanglement of Protestantism and nationalism in which different stances towards nationalism and anticolonialism can be found for every
group. Where the missionaries mainly tried to be apolitical but got associated with nationalism, the Korean Protestants actively participated in nationalist and anticolonial movements. The Protestant intellectuals had ideas that could be nationalistic but were not always anticolonial. The international Korean intellectuals were more actively involved in the independence movement and some of their Protestant ideas legitimized Korean nationalism. This thesis thoroughly analyses the stances of these groups towards Korean nationalism and anticolonialism by discussing the reactions of Protestant Korea to the
Japanese colonizers, the protestant influences in the March First Movement and the effect of Protestantism in international Korean communities and their nationalistic ideas and activities."

As overt articles lower the surprisal of the following noun, it was expected that article omission would occur more frequently before low surprisal nouns. However, while previous research for Dutch and German found results that were in line with the UIDH, the current study found the opposite effect.

ASMR refers to a physical reaction as well as an online subculture. What started with a Facebook group has grown into a large online community of ASMRtists posting their self-created videos that evoke a physical reaction called Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR): a tingling sensation down the spine which can be classified as “goosebumps in the scalp” or a “brain-gasm.” Within such videos, ASMRtists offer a mediated sonic experience by a set of performative techniques with their microphones such as whispering, ticking softly on objects, and microphone brushing. However, these performances produce a physical experience of a “touch” of the ASMRtist, a “tactile presence,” in which the boundary the mediated and the real seems to blur.
In this thesis, I explore the apparent paradox posed by microphone performance in ASMR videos: the production of a seemingly “real” experience through the act of recording sound. Building on scholars from science and technology studies, popular music studies, sound studies, and media studies, I show that these conditions can be uncovered through an analysis of the relationship between the ASMRtist and the microphone. First, I explore a theoretical framework through which the experience of presence and tactility can be deconstructed, arguing that these experiences are constructed through a set of historically and culturally specific human-microphone relationships. Second, I trace how these performative relationships with the microphone have developed. Through a historical analysis of the microphone in performative practices such as radio, funk, nineteenth-century theatre, and avant-garde, I show that the microphone has always served as a tool to mediate the epistemological differences that shape the intimate experience of ASMR videos today. Finally, I analyse how the current mediation of differences are channelled by the digital writing system of the microphone allow me to produce an intimate aesthetic in recording my own ASMR video.
Ultimately, I argue that it is through a process of touching upon these the boundary between these differences that a tactile presence is mediated. Together, these chapters aim to provide an approach that can account for the underresearched role of the microphone and the intimate listening experiences that have surrounded them. It is through such an approach that I aim to uncover the technological and material conditions through which the experience of presence and tactility through sound recording are produced."

The first assumption is that vibrators are mere tools. They are instruments that women can use to achieve their goal of sexual pleasure. The second assumption is that third-wave vibrators have become feminist tools, which embody feminist values. In light of popular postfeminism, which assumes that feminist struggles have ended and that full equality for all women has been achieved, I will critically question the assumption that vibrators are feminist tools (Lazar 2006). I will do so by integrating the concept of mediation with feminist theory. The concept of mediation, in a postphenomenological understanding, draws attention to the way in which technologies actively coshape experiences. Furthermore, such an understanding shows how subject and object are relationally constituted, rather than pre-given categories (Verbeek 2005; Ihde 2009). In order to understand the way in which the experience of sexual pleasure comes into being and the way in which the female subject is constituted in the relations, I will integrate the concept of mediation with feminist theory. I will discuss the concepts of female sexuality and the female subject through the works of Luce Irigaray, Lynne Segal, and Helene Cixous. From these works, it becomes clear that female sexuality and the female subject in our western society are known from a phallocentric, and masculine position (Cixous and Clement 1986; Irigaray 1985). In this thesis, I will analyze relations with two, third-wave vibrators, namely, We-Vibe’s Nova vibrator and Picobong’s Transformer vibrator. Through analyzing those case studies as embodied, mediated relations, I will question whether the experience of sexual pleasure and the constituted female subject, can indeed be understood as ‘feminist.’ In the case studies, I will show how phallocentric experiences of sexual pleasure are technologically mediated and how the female subject is constituted as lacking. This thesis will be a starting point to envision a true alterative feminine sexual pleasure and feminine subject."
RHYTHM AND SILENCE: RUBÉN DARÍO’S SHAMANIST POETICS,"['Tapia Hernandez, E.A.']","['Kaiser, dr. B. Mara']",2020-09-04T18:00:33Z,en,"['Ruben Dario, Language Revolution, Shamanism, Poetics, Silence, Rhythm, Heidegger, Thinker-poet']",Comparative Literary Studies,"This thesis focuses on an unexplored facet of the so-called “renewal of poetry” of the Hispanic fin de siècle by establishing Rubén Darío’s “shamanist poetics”. In the face of the aesthetic and philosophical decline of the Spanish language, the Nicaraguan bard renewed poetry. His endeavor consisted of a radical return to the mythical sources of his art, a rethinking and a re-experiencing of its most elemental virtues. In Darío’s poetic context, the “stress-accent” became an almost empty abstraction, signifying nothing in itself (Jitrik). As concept, it merely alluded to a phonetic feature of words. However, as this thesis argues, the “poetic-shamanist” (rhythmic) revolution of the stress-accent as it becomes the “soul” of language, “revived” the latter. 
In order to demonstrate Darío’s shamanist poetics, I will introduce his figure as poet as well as the contexts that led him to become a revolutionary of language (chapter one). Second, I will expose the belief systems that led Darío to come into contact with the shamanist tradition. Then, I will introduce shamanism itself as well as the poet’s appropriation of it (chapter two). Finally, this thesis aims to show evidence of Darío’s own shamanist poetics by close-reading some of his poems. This analysis elucidates how Darío, as a shaman-poet, displays his own “technique of ecstasy” (chapter three). As analytical tool, I apply Martin Heidegger’s thinking, who assists me to clarify how such technique works. By means of the ecstatic experience, the shaman-poet performs his task as “healer” of the soul, that is, as language healer or language renovator.  
In the introductory section, I establish  Darío’s “shamanist poetics” on the grounds of George Steiner’s idea of “language revolution”. Then, I underscore the relevance of this thesis by alluding to the shaman as a figure able to cover the vacuum of knowledge in the Darian Hispanic scholarship on the metaphysical and existential dimensions of Darío’s poetry. Third, I justify the use of Heidegger as analytical tool."

Therefore, the debate has hitherto left little room for the local and Panhellenic dimensions of early Greek Asklepieia. This thesis will challenge this as of yet rarely disputed communis opinio by analyzing to what extent early Greek Asklepieia resulted from local interests and Panhellenic processes of social and cultural change. It will do so by means of a comparative analysis of the geographical placement, layouts and structures, and religious practices of early sanctuaries of Asklepios, using the material and textual evidence of Asklepieia that were founded between the late sixth- and fourth centuries BCE. As such, this study will demonstrate that the cult of Asklepios was shaped by a combination of local and global tendencies. Panhellenic elements were adopted by sanctuaries of Asklepios and subsequently adapted to serve the local needs of the sanctuary and its associated polis. Therefore, every early Greek Asklepieion was to some extent a glocalizing sanctuary."

This cross-sectional study examines the relationships between harmonious and obsessive work passion, work engagement, and Organisational Citizenship Behaviour in the  Romanian general workforce. The Dualistic Model of Passion and the Self-Determination Theory serve as a theoretical framework. Data were collected from various organisations in Romania (N=196) and two mediation analyses were conducted in order to test the hypotheses of the current research. Results showed that harmoniously and obsessively passionate employees display more work engagement in the workplace. However, no significant direct relationship was found between either harmonious or obsessive passion and OCB. Work engagement fully mediated the relationships between harmonious and obsessive passion respectively, and OCB, indicating that work engagement is a powerful catalyst in the Romanian work environment. The present research adds to the work passion literature by investigating the duality of the work passion construct in a non-Western setting. Thus, it provides a more comprehensive understanding of the different outcomes the two types of passion bring about in the workplace. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that delves into both harmonious and obsessive passion in relation to work engagement and OCB in an Eastern context."

We took on the definition of engagement as the process by which interactors start, maintain and end their perceived connection to each other during interaction and included the state where an interactor does not have or no longer has the intention to interact. Based on this, four states could be distinguished: no interest, intention to interact (or interest), engaged and ending interaction. The purpose of developing this model was to contribute to improving an informative conversation between human and robot by improving the way a robot determines who to engage with or pay attention to. Since engagement behaviour is not well understood in the human-human context, despite its apparent significance, we looked further into the research done both in human-human and human-robot interaction. Based on this, we have composed a set of features and set up a Naive Bayes classifier to classify the states of engagement. The features used are: distance from the robot, facing direction, gaze, position, sound direction and velocity. The model can classify one person at a time, however the system is designed with the possibility to expand it for multiple people as well as additional features. We intend to both choose the features and design the model in a way that it can be used regardless of the robot or platform as much as possible. However, to allow testing and to have a system that can be used in practice, we take the humanoid robot Pepper, developed by Softbank, as our main platform. This has given some limitations as to what features are chosen and to how the model is implemented. Evaluation of the model gives promising results for the overall model and the states no interest, intention to interact and engaged, however the model performs badly for the state ending interaction. We discuss for the latter state specifically and for the model in general possibilities for improvement."

refugees by faith-based organizations (FBO’s) in Lebanon. Due to the fragile balance of powers
in this sectarian state and other factors weakening it, the state is unable to provide humanitarian
aid to refugees. This leaves NGO’s to fill that vacuum. Resembling the sectarian social
landscape of Lebanon, many NGO’s working in the humanitarian aid sector have a religious
identity. Given the vulnerability and dependence of refugees, various ethical dilemmas may
arise when FBO’s combine providing humanitarian aid with proselytization. It is this dual
purpose that the present study aims to analyse, by investigating the role that religion plays in
four different FBO’s. Two of these have an Islamic identity and two a Christian one. For both
religions, one organisation operates on a national level and the other on an international level.
The role religion plays in the discourse of these organisations as well as the way the religious
identity becomes visible in the projects and activities of these FBO’s will be analysed. It will
be concluded that religion plays a significant role in the discourse of all four organisations, and
takes a particularly prominent role in the activities and projects of the two nationally operating

Title: Nurse Handover to Maternity Home Care from the Patient’s Perspective after discharge from a tertiary hospital.
Background: Adequate handover facilitates the transmission of essential information and is important for continuity of care. Engaging patients and their family during healthcare delivery and the transition of care contributes to patient-centred care and is crucial to ensuring patient safety and improving the quality of the healthcare continuum. Literature does not clarify how the transfer of postpartum nursing care from the hospital to maternity home care is conducted in the Dutch system or how patients are involved in this transfer.
Aim: To explore patients’ perspectives on nurse handover to maternity home care after discharge from a Dutch tertiary hospital with regard to experienced involvement, anticipation of patient needs, provision of information, information needs, and continuity of maternity care in order to identify gaps and opportunities for improvement.
Method: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews based on a topic list was conducted and thematically analysed.
Results: Twelve patients participated until saturation was reached. Five themes emerged: ‘Hospital nurses provide practical support’, ‘Limited parental involvement, ‘A person-centred professional relationship stimulates patients’ confidence, ‘Maternity-home-care assistants support patients to take over care’ and ‘Temporarily changed information processing’. 
Conclusion: Despite patients’ positive experiences with discharge and transfer of care to maternity home care, nursing leadership is required to strengthen and professionalize discharge- and transition-related nursing by integrating evidence-based practice, patient-centred care, and patient involvement. These improvements contribute to increased patient satisfaction and empowerment and decreased patient distress, which improves parent-newborn interaction.
Recommendations: Nursing leadership is needed to increase awareness of the nursing role in and importance of patient participation through education and peer supervision, effectively empowering nurses to actively involve parents. Future research should explore how nurses can best involve parents in discharge and transfer of care as well as the experiences of younger and non-Dutch-speaking mothers.


Samenvatting
Titel: De verpleegkundige overdracht naar de kraamzorg vanuit het perspectief van de patiënt na ontslag uit een tertiair ziekenhuis.
Achtergrond: Adequate overdracht vergemakkelijkt de overdracht van essentiële informatie en bevordert de continuïteit van zorg. Het betrekken van patiënten en hun familie bij de zorgverlening en overdracht van zorg draagt bij aan patiëntgerichte zorg en is cruciaal om patiëntveiligheid en kwaliteitsverbetering te waarborgen. In de literatuur is het onduidelijk hoe de verpleegkundige overdracht in Nederland postpartum vanuit het ziekenhuis naar kraamzorg thuis plaatsvindt en op welke manier patiënten bij deze overdracht betrokken zijn.
Doel: Onderzoeken van het patiënten perspectief op de verpleegkundige overdracht naar kraamzorg thuis na ontslag uit een Nederlands academisch ziekenhuis met betrekking tot ervaren betrokkenheid, afstemmen op behoeften, informatieverstrekking, informatiebehoeften en continuïteit van kraamzorg om hiaten en verbeterpunten te identificeren.
Methode: Een kwalitatief onderzoek met semigestructureerde interviews op basis van een topic lijst is uitgevoerd en thematisch geanalyseerd.
Resultaten: Twaalf participanten zijn geïncludeerd tot datasaturatie werd bereikt. Vijf thema’s kwamen naar voren: ‘Verpleegkundigen in het ziekenhuis bieden praktische ondersteuning', 'Beperkte betrokkenheid van ouders', 'Door een persoonsgerichte professionele relatie voelen patiënten zich zekerder’, 'Kraamverzorgenden ondersteunen patiënten om de zorg over te nemen’ en 'Tijdelijk veranderde informatieverwerking’.
Conclusie: Patiënten ervaren het ontslag en de overdracht van zorg naar de kraamzorg doorgaans als positief. Desondanks is verpleegkundig leiderschap nodig om deze verpleegkundige zorg te verbeteren en te professionaliseren. De integratie van evidence-based werken, patiëntgerichte zorg en patiënten meer betrekken in zorg, zal bijdragen aan patiënttevredenheid, empowerment en afname van stress. Dit verbetert de ouder-pasgeborene interactie.
Aanbevelingen: Verpleegkundig leiderschap is nodig om verpleegkundigen bewust te maken van het belang van patiënt participatie en hun rol daarin door onderwijs en intervisie, waardoor verpleegkundigen ouders actief gaan betrekken in de zorg. Toekomstig onderzoek zal moeten verkennen hoe verpleegkundigen nieuwe ouders het beste kunnen betrekken bij ontslag en zorgoverdracht en ook de perspectieven van jongere en niet-Nederlandstalige patiënten."
Frontline nurses’ leadership practices in relation to a nursing role differentiation healthcare restructuring: A qualitative study,"['Arts, L.S.M.']","['Lalleman, PCB']",2020-09-07T18:00:25Z,en,"['Keywords: healthcare, nursing, nurse role differentiation, emotions\nKernwoorden: gezondheidszorg, verpleegkunde, functiedifferentiatie, emoties']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Abstract 
Background: The patient population is ageing and the complexity of healthcare has increased. This necessitates changes in the organization and work of nurses, including competent nurses and fitting skill mix. Nevertheless, differentiating in nursing profession often causes commotion in the professional field. Such negative emotions of nurses are easily transferred to patients potentially resulting in reduced quality of care. Therefore, it is key for frontline nurses to manage their emotions through emotional intelligence. It remains unclear to whether all nurses experienced the impact of a hospital restructuring to the same degree.
Aim: To gain insight in nurses’ experiences, emotions and leadership practices in relation to a nursing role differentiation healthcare restructuring.
Method: A generic descriptive qualitative study was conducted between February and June 2020. The study population consisted of registered nurses working in the frontline of nursing. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and were analysed guided by the six phases of thematic analysis described by Braun and Clarke.
Results: Nurses experienced feelings such as being undervalued and agitation, which contributed to emotions such as anger and disappointment. Nurses admitted a grim working culture existed. Several reactions of coping have been identified, from which could be comprehended that the degree of presence of emotional intelligence affected the manner of coping. Moreover, it may contributed to awareness that communication and receiving recognition is crucial. 
Conclusion: Nurses experienced deep emotions which can be compared with grief. Team managers play a central role in attitude, and acceptance of nurses. Investment in a constant dialogue, where a conflict is not shunned, is necessary to take the profession to a higher level. 
Implications of key findings: To invest in the emotional side of change and stimulate the communication among nurses in order to implement nursing role differentiation successfully.

Samenvatting
Achtergrond: De patiëntenpopulatie wordt ouder en de complexiteit van de gezondheidszorg is toegenomen. Dit vereist veranderingen in de organisatie en werkzaamheden van verpleegkundigen, inclusief bekwame verpleegkundigen en passende vaardigheidsmix. 
Desondanks veroorzaakt differentiëren in het verpleegkundig beroep vaak commotie in het professionele veld. Dergelijke negatieve emoties van verpleegkundigen worden gemakkelijk overgedragen op patiënten, wat mogelijk kan leiden tot een verminderde kwaliteit van zorg. 
Daarom is het voor verpleegkundigen in de frontlinie essentieel om hun emoties te beheersen door middel van emotionele intelligentie. Het blijft onduidelijk of alle verpleegkundigen in dezelfde mate de impact van een ziekenhuisherstructurering hebben ervaren.
Doel: Inzicht krijgen in de ervaringen, emoties en leiderschap van verpleegkundigen in relatie tot een functiedifferentiatie herstructurering van de gezondheidszorg. 
Methode: Een generiek kwalitatief onderzoek werd uitgevoerd tussen februari en juni 2020. De onderzoekspopulatie bestond uit geregistreerde frontlinie verpleegkundigen.  Semigestructureerde interviews werden afgenomen en werden geanalyseerd aan de hand van de zes fasen van thematische analyse beschreven door Braun en Clarke. 
Resultaten: Verpleegkundigen ervaarden onrust en het gevoel ondergewaardeerd te zijn, wat bijdroeg aan emoties als woede en teleurstelling. Verpleegkundigen gaven toe dat er een grimmige werkcultuur bestond. Er zijn verschillende coping-reacties geïdentificeerd, waaruit kon worden afgeleid dat de mate van aanwezigheid van emotionele intelligentie de manier van coping beïnvloedde. Bovendien kan het bijdragen tot het besef dat communicatie en het ontvangen van erkenning cruciaal zijn. 
Conclusie: Verpleegkundigen ervaarden diepe emoties die te vergelijken zijn met rouw. Teammanagers spelen een centrale rol in de houding en acceptatie van verpleegkundigen. Investeren in een constante dialoog, waarbij een conflict niet wordt geschuwd, is nodig om het verpleegkundig beroep naar een hoger niveau te tillen. 
Aanbevelingen: Investeren in de emotionele kant van verandering en de communicatie tussen verpleegkundigen stimuleren is noodzakelijk om functiedifferentiatie met succes te implementeren."
Multimodal prehabilitation in high-risk patients undergoing elective resection for colorectal cancer: A retrospective cohort study,"['Klerk, M. de']","['Verdaasdonk, E.G.G.']",2020-09-07T18:00:27Z,en,"['Prehabilitation, Colorectal Neoplasm [MeSH], Nutrition, Postoperative Complications [MeSH].\nPrehabilitatie, Colorectale kanker, Voedingsstatus, Postoperatieve complicaties.']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Colorectal cancer accounts for approximately 10% of cancer-related mortality worldwide and surgery is the only curative treatment. However, postoperative complications occur in up to 50% of all patients. The number and severity of complications are related to the patients’ preoperative functional capacity and nutritional status. The window of time between the cancer diagnosis and elective surgery provides an opportunity to improve functional capacity and nutritional status. It may lead to a reduction of postoperative complications, this is called prehabilitation. 
Aim: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a four-week multimodal prehabilitation program on postoperative complications, prolonged length of hospital stay, unplanned readmissions, and mortality.
Method: Data was extracted from existing data and patients’ electronic medical files. Univariate analysis was performed using Fisher’s Exact and Mann-Whitney U test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed afterwards. 
Results: 351 patients were included in the study (n=275 non-prehabilitation, n=76 prehabilitation). The number of patients with postoperative complications differed significantly between groups (40% versus 26.3%, p=.032) in which prehabilitation was a protective factor (OR=0.5, 95% CI, 0.253-0.988, p=.046). Unplanned readmissions differed significantly (16.4% versus 5.3%, p=.014) in which prehabilitation was a protective factor (OR=0.313, 95% CI, 0.102-0.954, p=.041). Median hospital days of stay was significant 1 day shorter for the prehabilitation group (p=.004). Mortality and prolonged length of stay did not differ. 
Conclusion: The multimodal prehabilitation program leads to a reduction of postoperative complications, fewer unplanned readmissions, and also shortens the median hospital stay compared with standard care in high-risk patients undergoing elective tumor resection. 
Recommendations: Future research should focus on developing and organizing prehabilitation programs for other surgical indications. More insight is needed which patients most benefit from prehabilitation and how the programs can be more patient tailored. 

Achtergrond: Colorectale kanker is verantwoordelijk voor ongeveer 10% van de sterfte door kanker wereldwijd en een operatie is de enige curatieve behandeling. Echter ontstaan postoperatieve complicaties in 50% van alle patiënten. Het aantal en de ernst van de complicaties hangt samen met de preoperatieve fysieke capaciteit en voedingsstatus. Het tijdsvenster voor de operatie biedt een kans om deze patiëntfactoren te verbeteren. Dit kan leiden tot een verminderen van postoperatieve complicaties en een korter ziekenhuisverblijf. Dit wordt prehabilitatie genoemd. 
Doel: Het doel van de studie is om de impact van het vierweekse multimodale prehabilitatie programma op postoperatieve complicaties, verlengd ziekenhuisverblijf, ongeplande heropnames en mortaliteit te toetsen.
Methode: De data is verzameld uit bestaande data en de elektronische medische patiëntendossiers. Univariate analyse werd uitgevoerd met de Fisher’s Exact en Mann-Whitney U toets. Daaropvolgend werd een multivariate logistische regressie analyse uitgevoerd. 
Resultaten: In totaal zijn er 351 patiënten in de studie geïncludeerd (n=271 niet-geprehabiliteerden, n=76 geprehabiliteerden). Het aantal patiënten met postoperatieve complicaties verschilde significant tussen de groepen (40% versus 26.3%, p=.032) waarin prehabilitatie een beschermende factor was (OR=0.500, 95% CI, 0.253-0.988, p=.046). Ongeplande heropnames verschilde significant (16.4% versus 5.3%, p=.014) waarbij prehabilitatie een beschermende factor was (OR=0.313, 95% CI, 0.102-0.954, p=.041). De mediane opnameduur in dagen was significant één dag korter voor de prehabilitatie groep (p=.004). Mortaliteit en een verlengd ziekenhuisverblijf verschilden niet tussen de twee groepen. 
Conclusie: Prehabilitatie reduceert postoperatieve complicaties, ongeplande heropnames en de gemiddelde opnameduur in vergelijking met de standaard zorg bij hoog-risico patiënten met colorectale kanker.
Aanbevelingen: Toekomstig onderzoek moet gericht zijn op het ontwikkelen en organiseren van prehabilitatie programma’s voor andere chirurgische indicaties. Meer inzicht is nodig in welke patiënten het meest profiteren van prehabilitatie en hoe de prehabilitatie programma’s meer patiëntgericht kunnen zijn."

Title: Experiences of patients with bipolar disorder using a dental health e-module
Background: Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder with manic and depressive episodes, which are interchanged with euthymic periods. It affects approximately 1.3% of the Dutch population. The illness and the psychofarmaca used to treat it have a negative effect on dental health. Brushing is done too hard or not at all. The patient gets a dry mouth because of the medication and eats and drinks sugary foods, which causes cavities. To prevent this, maintaining good dental hygiene is important. E-health can help to educate patients about maintaining good dental health.
Aim: To determine the acceptability of a dental health e-module by exploring the user experiences of patients with bipolar disorder.
Method: A qualitative generic approach was chosen with semi-structured phone interviews. These were analyzed using thematic analysis according to Braun and Clarke.
Results: Nine patients participated in the study. Five themes were found: importance, feelings, raised awareness, knowledge, and using the module. The subject was found to be very important. With raised awareness, dental problems could be lessened or prevented. All participants recommend the module be offered to all patients with bipolar disorder who use psychofarmaca.
Conclusion: The module would serve as a reference work for patients. Some improvements were suggested in language and the way it is offered to patients. The use of the module has impacted the way some participants care for their dental health by using toothpicks, mouthwash and an electric toothbrush.
Implications of key findings: With some changes made to the module and the way it is offered to patients, it could be a valuable addition to regular care for patients with bipolar disorder who use psychofarmaca.



 
Samenvatting 

Titel: Ervaringen van patiënten met bipolaire stoornis met het gebruik van een mondzorg 
eHealth module
Achtergrond: Bipolaire stoornis is een stemmingsstoornis met manische en depressieve episodes, afgewisseld met stabiele periodes die ongeveer 1,3% van de Nederlandse bevolking treft. De aandoening en de medicatie die worden gebruikt, hebben een negatief effect op mondgezondheid. Poetsen wordt te hard gedaan, of helemaal niet. De medicatie veroorzaakt een droge mond die wordt behandeld met zoete drankjes of snoep. Om gaatjes en hoge tandartskosten te voorkomen, is het onderhouden van de mondgezondheid erg belangrijk. Er is een eHealth mondzorgmodule ontwikkeld in samenwerking met patiënten, behandelaars en tandartsen met als doel de kennis te vergroten rond goed mondzorg. 
Doel: Bepalen of patienten met een bipolaire stoornis een mondzorg eHealth module accepteren, door het onderzoeken van gebruikerservaringen.
Methode: Een kwalitatieve benadering werd gekozen waarbij semi gestructureerde telefonische interviews zijn afgenomen. De interviews zijn geanalyseerd met thematische analyse en constante vergelijking volgens Braun & Clarke.
Resultaten: Negen patiënten hebben mee gedaan. Er zijn vijf thema’s gevonden: belangrijkheid, gevoelens, bewustwording, kennis en gebruik van de module. Het onderwerp werd erg belangrijk gevonden. Door vergroot bewustzijn zouden tandproblemen verminderd of voorkomen kunnen worden. Alle deelnemers bevelen de module aan.
Conclusie: De module zou als naslagwerk kunnen dienen voor patiënten. De taal en manier van aanbieden zou verbeterd moeten worden. Het gebruik van de module heeft ervoor gezorgd dat deelnemers nu anders voor hun gebit zorgen, door het gebruik van mondwater, tandenstokers en een elektrische tandenborstel.
Implicaties voor de klinische praktijk: Met enige veranderingen aangebracht in de module en de manier waarop deze aan patiënten aangeboden wordt, kan de module een waardevolle aanvulling zijn op de gebruikelijk zorg voor patiënten met bipolaire stoornis die psychofarmaca gebruiken."
‘How do COPD patients perceive self-management of their illness and what can physiotherapists do to facilitate this? – a qualitative research.‘,"['Kloosterman, L.M.']","['lucht, F. van der', 'Schans, C.P. van der', 'Net, J. van der']",2020-09-07T18:00:24Z,en,"['COPD, self-management, physiotherapist']",Fysiotherapiewetenschap,"Background : In line with European public health policies, patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are being held more responsible for taking control of one's own health. However, studies have shown that the COPD population show less proactiveness and take less control in healthcare. The perception of COPD patients on self-management after newly introduced reimbursements policy have not yet been investigated. 
Aim: To discover what the perception of COPD patients on self-management is and what physiotherapists can do to facilitate this.
Methods: Purposeful sampling of COPD patients and physiotherapists from physiotherapy centre ‘Van Kasteel’ was used. Four focus group interviews using an interview guide were conducted. Three of those were with patients and one with physiotherapists. Sessions were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A constant comparison analysis strategy was used to analyse the data using ATLAS.ti.
Results: Patients do not seem to be able to change their behaviour and are therefore not likely to take initiative for self-management. Informed decision-making (IDM) is complicated by the fact that patients do not actively search for information, despite the fact that they seem to have a need for information. Patients are also scoring low on shared decision-making (SDM). Only a few of them make decisions together with healthcare providers. In the field of behavioural change, there is a difference between what patients deem important and what physiotherapists think is necessary to improve their quality of life. Moreover, a discrepancy exists in the perception of physiotherapists. Whereas physiotherapists see themselves as facilitators in the treatment of COPD, patients consider physiotherapists as stimulators at most.
Conclusion and key findings: Self-management does not seem to play a role in the life of the COPD patient. To improve patients IDM, SDM and behavioural change, physiotherapists should use an integrated approach according to the knowledge and theory of behavioural change models and focus more on communication and adequate provision of information to improve self-management in COPD patients. The results of this study could help define a new strategy on how to incentivize the desired behaviour among COPD patients to improve self-management."
The experienced barriers and facilitators of healthcare professionals regarding the current use of the Pain Assessment Checklist for Seniors with Limited Ability to Communicate-Dutch (PACSLAC-D): a qualitative study,"['Prins, A.M.']","['Oldenmenger, W.H.', 'Weldam, S.W.M.']",2020-09-07T18:00:24Z,en,"['Pain, dementia, PACSLAC-D, barriers, facilitators']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Approximately 50% of people with dementia also have a painful condition. Symptoms associated with dementia may lead to difficulties expressing pain experiences. To objectively measure the pain of patients with dementia, the Pain Assessment Checklist for Seniors with Limited Ability to Communicate–Dutch (PACSLAC-D) was developed. Clinical practice shows that the PACSLAC-D is not used effectively in daily practice on the geriatric ward of a general hospital due to improper implementation. To re-implement the PACSLAC-D on the geriatric ward, it is necessary to assess the experienced barriers and facilitators of healthcare professionals (HCPs) regarding the current use of the PACSLAC-D.
Aim: To describe HCPs’ experienced barriers and facilitators regarding the current use of the PACSLAC-D on the geriatric ward of a general hospital.
Method: A generic descriptive qualitative research design was used, with focus groups and individual interviews. Data analysis was conducted through thematic analysis. 
Results: Eighteen HCPs participated in the focus groups or interviews. The themes “barriers,” “facilitators,” and “implementation” were identified. The main barrier was nurses’ resistance of use. This resistance can be explained by the nurses’ preference to rely on clinical judgment and the multi-interpretability that nurses experienced. Most important facilitators were the insight that the PACSLAC-D gave into the degree of experienced pain in patients and the course of pain over multiple days.
Conclusion: Various barriers and facilitators concerning use of the PACSLAC-D in daily practice were described. The main barrier, nurses’ resistance of use, was explained by nurses’ preference to rely on their clinical judgement and the poor interrater reliability of the PACSLAC-D. To overcome this barrier, HCPs should be engaged in formulating the re-implementation strategy. 
Recommendations: A tailored re-implementation strategy must be developed in consultation with the HCPs. Future research should evaluate the effects of the re-implementation."
A qualitative study to nurse role differentiation in Dutch hospitals: an invitation for experimentation,"['Zwan, A.H. van der']","['Lalleman, P.C.B.']",2020-09-07T18:00:26Z,en,"['Keywords Nursing, differentiation, hospitals, motives, strategy']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Nurse role differentiation is associated with reduced patient mortality and complications. However, nurse role differentiation in the Netherlands has been discussed for decades and in 2017 it still has not been implemented. An announced law amendment and proposed healthcare reform to catalyse the implementation provoked nationwide resistance among nurses and resulted in an abolishment of this law. In the light of these developments a follow-up on earlier research is warranted to further investigate the current state-of-affairs concerning nurse role differentiation.  
Aim: Gain insight into the reasons and motives of the chosen strategies to further develop and implement nurse role differentiation, according to project leaders responsible for the reform towards nurse role differentiation, in hospitals in the Netherlands. 
Method: A generic qualitative study including ten semi-structured interviews with thirteen participants was conducted in February and March 2020. Interviews were voice recorded, transcribed, and thematically analysed according to Braun and Clarke.
Results: Four themes emerged: A change was seen from extrinsic reasons to intrinsic motives to further develop nurse role differentiation. The used strategy is known as experimenting and developing. Leadership and management played an important role in further developing nurse role differentiation, as well as listening to the voices of nurses. 
Conclusion: The strategy of experimenting and developing seemed suitable for further developing nurse role differentiation wherein the unit manager’s role was essential. Through this strategy, nurses were able to raise their voices and influence the development of differentiation.
Recommendations: Hospitals should consider the crucial role of the unit manager during the reform. Nurse role differentiation for specialised wards is underexposed. Further research is needed to explore how nurse role differentiation can improve nursing care on these wards."
Public opinion leadership among nurses: a thematic analysis,"['Spoolder, D.A.E.']","['Lalleman, P.C.B.']",2020-09-07T18:00:32Z,en,"['public opinion leadership, healthcare reform, voice, nurse leadership, influencers, publiek opinieleiderschap, functiedifferentiatie, verpleegkundig leiderschap, invloed']",Verplegingswetenschap,"ABSTRACT
Public opinion leadership among nurses: a thematic analysis
Background: Worldwide, nursing staffing shortage is a major concern. Nurse retention is positively associated with participation in policy and leadership. However, there is little evidence on influencing the public debate in policy making processes, which can be called public opinion leadership. In the summer of 2019, many nurses in the Netherlands raised their voices and influenced the public debate regarding a law proposal on differentiating nursing practice. What remains unclear is how public opinion leadership manifests itself.
Aim: To explore how public opinion leadership manifests itself during a nationwide healthcare reform and the reasons and motives of nurses to raise their voice in media.
Method: Generic qualitative study with thematic analysis and abductive approach. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with Dutch nurses whom raised their voice in public media on the healthcare reform.
Results: A portrait of public opinion leadership shows a deep feeling of altruism, a clinical background and strategical skills, combined with policy and political awareness. Key themes are emotions and dynamic networking. Emotions varied from upset and annoyed to feeling underappreciated or responsible. Dynamic networking is used to search for fellow thinkers and nurses approached politicians through social media. Diversely, social media was a source of aggression, which led to people looking for support to handle this negativity. 
Conclusion: Public opinion leadership manifests itself by altruism, a clinical background and strategical skills, combined with policy and political awareness. Reasons and motives lie within emotions and dynamic networking, which made public opinion leaders want to raise their voice. Social media also played a role, which adds onto the current literature surrounding POL.
Recommendations: The findings can be used to examine how public opinion leadership can be encouraged among nurses, with regard to improve nurse retention in the future.

SAMENVATTING
Publiek opinieleiderschap onder verpleegkundigen: een thematische analyse
Achtergrond: Er heerst een wereldwijd verpleegkundigentekort. Leiderschap en participatie in beleid kunnen bijdragen aan het behoud van verpleegkundigen. Echter is er maar weinig bekend over publiek opinieleiderschap, waarin verpleegkundigen invloed uitoefenen op beleidsmakers, door zich te uiten in de media. Een recent wetsvoorstel in Nederland omtrent functiedifferentiatie maakte onderscheid tussen verpleegkundigen en regieverpleegkundigen. Dit wetsvoorstel veroorzaakte enorme ophef en veel, voornamelijk inservice opgeleide verpleegkundigen lieten van zich horen. Waar publiek opinieleiderschap voorheen nauwelijks werd gezien, veranderde dat nu. Wat nog onduidelijk is, is hoe publiek opinieleiderschap zich manifesteert. 
Doel: Exploreren hoe publiek opinieleiderschap zich manifesteert gedurende een landelijke hervorming van de verpleegkundige beroepenstructuur en wat redenen en motieven van verpleegkundigen zijn om van zich te laten horen in de media.
Methode: Kwalitatieve studie met thematische analyse en abductie. Twaalf semigestructureerde interviews werden afgenomen met Nederlandse verpleegkundigen die hun stem hebben laten horen in de media rondom differentiatie van verpleegkundigen.
Resultaten: Een portret van publiek opinieleiderschap laat onbaatzuchtigheid zien, gecombineerd met  een klinische achtergrond, strategische vaardigheden en kennis van beleid en politiek. Kernthema’s zijn emotie en dynamisch netwerken. Emoties varieerden van boos en geïrriteerd, tot zich ondergewaardeerd of verantwoordelijk voelen. Dynamisch netwerken werd gebruikt om medestanders te vinden en verpleegkundigen benaderden politici via social media. Daarentegen was social media ook een bron van agressie, waarvoor verpleegkundigen steun bij anderen zochten. 
Conclusie: Publiek opinieleiderschap manifesteert zich door onbaatzuchtigheid, een klinische achtergrond, strategische eigenschappen en kennis van beleid en politiek. Emoties en dynamisch netwerken vormen redenen en motieven voor het laten zien van publiek opinieleiderschap. De rol van social media is nieuw met betrekking tot publiek opinieleiderschap.
Aanbevelingen: De bevindingen kunnen worden gebruikt om publiek opinieleiderschap in de toekomst te bemoedigen, met als doel het behoud van verpleegkundigen in de toekomst te bevorderen.

Implementation of fall prevention programs: exploring the barriers and needs of district nurses - a qualitative study,"['Kuipers, M.']","['Bleijenberg, N.']",2020-09-07T18:00:31Z,en,['English: Accidental Falls; Prevention and Control; Primary Care Nursing; Qualitative Research; Aged\n\nNederlands: Vallen; Preventie; Wijkverpleging; Kwalitatief onderzoek; Ouderen.'],Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Falls are considered a threat to the independence and health of older people. Dutch district nurses have an important role in maintaining independence among older people living in the community and prevention of falling. Despite the availability of existing evidence with regards to the effectiveness of fall prevention programs, its implementation in clinical practice remains challenging. Little is known about the barriers and needs that district nurses perceive with regards to implementation of existing fall prevention programs. Aim: Exploring the perceived barriers and needs of district nurses with regards to the implementation of existing evidence-based fall prevention programs for older people living at home. Method: A generic qualitative design with semi-structured face-to-face and telephone interviews was conducted. District nurses were sampled purposively. Interviews were guided by a topic list. All interviews were conducted between March and April, 2020 in the Netherlands. Braun and Clarke’s thematic analysis was applied.Results: In total, twelve district nurses were interviewed. Four main themes were identified: experienced knowledge deficit, perceiving collaboration on an interprofessional level, reaching and attaining older people and perceiving urgency of fall prevention.
Conclusion:The results of this study demonstrate that district nurses perceive knowledge deficits with regards to fall prevention. Fragmentation of care and lack of concertation between professionals are perceived as important barriers in the interprofessional collaboration. Needed in enhancing interprofessional collaboration is effective communication. Reaching and attaining older people and the perceived urgency of fall prevention can also be considered important barriers. The findings may provide guidance to enhance a successful implementation of fall prevention programs for older people living at home.

Dutch summary: 
Achtergrond: Vallen wordt beschouwd als een bedreiging voor de onafhankelijkheid en gezondheid van ouderen. Nederlandse wijkverpleegkundigen hebben een belangrijke rol in het behouden van de zelfstandigheid van ouderen die thuis wonen en daarmee ook het voorkomen van vallen. Ondanks het beschikbare wetenschappelijke bewijs over de effectiviteit van valpreventie programma’s blijft de implementatie naar de praktijk weerbarstig en moeilijk. Er is weinig bekend over de knelpunten en behoeftes die wijkverpleegkundigen ervaren met betrekking tot implementatie van bestaande valpreventie programma’s. 
Doel: Het exploreren van de ervaren knelpunten en behoeftes van wijkverpleegkundigen met betrekking tot de implementatie van bestaande wetenschappelijk bewezen valpreventie programma’s voor thuiswonende ouderen.
Methode: Een generiek kwalitatief onderzoeksdesign met semigestructureerde face-to-face en telefonische interviews werd toegepast. Wijkverpleegkundigen werden doelbewust geselecteerd. De interviews werden gehouden met behulp van een topiclijst. Alle interviews werden afgenomen in maart en april, 2020 in Nederland. Thematische analyse werd toegepast volgens Braun en Clarke. 
Resultaten:Twaalf wijkverpleegkundigen werden geïnterviewd in totaal. Vier hoofdthema’s werden geïdentificeerd: ervaren kennistekort, ervaren samenwerking op interprofessioneel gebied, het bereiken en vasthouden van ouderen en de ervaren urgentie van valpreventie.  
Conclusie: De resultaten van deze studie tonen aan dat wijkverpleegkundigen een kennistekort ervaren op het gebied van valpreventie. Versplintering van zorg en gebrek aan afstemming tussen professionals worden beschouwd als de grootste knelpunten op het gebied van interprofessionele samenwerking. Nodig hierin is effectieve communicatie. Het bereiken en vasthouden van ouderen en de ervaren urgentie van valpreventie worden ook gezien als belangrijke knelpunten.
De bevindingen kunnen handvatten bieden bij een succesvolle implementatie van valpreventie programma’s voor thuiswonende ouderen."
Perspectives of nurse specialists on moving follow-up oncology care closer to home,"['Jongh, M.M.E. de']","['Vervoort, S.C.J.M']",2020-09-07T18:00:32Z,en,"['Perspectives, nurse specialist, follow-up care, cancer patients; Perspectief, verpleegkundig specialist, follow-up zorg, kankerpatiënten']",Verplegingswetenschap,"English abstract
Title: Perspectives of nurse specialists on moving follow-up oncology care closer to home.
Background: There is a continued rise of cancer patients who receive follow-up care. To maintain good quality care, it is necessary to explore other possibilities of providing this kind of care. In this study, the possibility of moving follow-up care of the nurse specialists will be explored. Patients will benefit if the follow-up care of nurse specialists could be moved in facilities closer to the patients’ home or when patients can stay at home while receiving follow-up care. Unfortunately, little is known on the possibilities of moving follow-up care of nurse specialists closer to home.  
Aim: To gain insight in nurse specialists’ perspectives, working in the outpatient clinic, on follow-up care of adult cancer patients closer to home. 
Method: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted. The thematic analysis framework of Braun and Clarke was used for analysis.
Results: Four themes emerged from the data on the perspectives of nurse specialists on follow-up care closer to home: 1) the needs of patients as the starting point, 2) the perceived preconditions for moving follow-up care, 3) the perceived own role of the nurse specialist, and 4) the perceived possibilities of moving follow-up care.
Conclusion: This study provides insight in the perspectives of nurse specialists on follow-up care of adult cancer patients closer to home. Nurse specialists believe that moving follow-up care by placing the hospital-based consultations within patients’ homes using technology, is a realistic and preferable manner to adapt to the future of out-of-hospital follow-up care.
Recommendations: For further research it is of great importance to gain insight on patients’ perspectives and in the concept of meaningful care.

Titel: Het perspectief van verpleegkundig specialisten op het verplaatsen van follow-up zorg voor oncologiepatiënten dichter bij huis.
Achtergrond: Er is een continue toename van kankerpatiënten die follow-up zorg ontvangen. Voor het behouden van kwalitatief goede zorg is het nodig om andere mogelijkheden te exploreren. In deze studie, wordt de mogelijkheid van het verplaatsen van de follow-up zorg van de verpleegkundig specialist onderzocht. Het zou patiënten ten goede komen wanneer deze zorg verplaatst zou worden naar faciliteiten dichter bij huis of wanneer de patiënt thuis kan blijven terwijl hij follow-up zorg ontvangt. Helaas is er nog weinig bekend over de mogelijkheden om follow-up zorg te verplaatsen. 
Doel: Om inzicht te verkrijgen in het perspectief van de verpleegkundige specialist, werkzaam op de poli van een ziekenhuis, op follow-up zorg van kankerpatiënten dichter bij huis.
Methode: Een kwalitatieve studie met behulp van semi-gestructureerde interviews. Het framework van Braun en Clarke is gebruikt voor de thematische analyse.
Resultaten: Vier thema’s geven het perspectief van de verpleegkundig specialist op follow-up zorg dichter bij huis weer: 1) de behoefte van de patiënt als beginpunt, 2) de randvoorwaarden voor het verplaatsen van follow-up zorg, 3) de eigen rol van de verpleegkundig specialist en 4) de mogelijkheden van het verplaatsen van follow-up zorg.
Conclusie: Deze studie geeft inzicht in het perspectief van verpleegkundig specialisten op het verplaatsten van follow-up zorg voor volwassen oncologiepatiënten dichter naar huis. Verpleegkundig specialisten zijn van mening dat het verplaatsen van ziekenhuisconsultaties naar bij patiënten thuis, met behulp van technologie, een realistische en wenselijke manier is om de toekomstige follow-up zorg buiten het ziekenhuis te realiseren. 
Aanbevelingen: Het is van groot belang om eerst inzicht te verkrijgen in het perspectief van de patiënt en daarnaast ook in het begrip zinvolle zorg."
"Development of the revised pressure ulcer guideline in institutional healthcare organisations
Facilitators and barriers that determine the decision of stakeholders who are involved in the implementation process of the revised guideline","['Swinkels, E.B.W.']","['van Gaal, B.G.I.']",2020-09-07T18:00:31Z,en,['Pressure Ulcer [MeSH]; Healthcare provider [MeSH]; Practice Guideline [MeSH]; Implementation Science [MeSH]; cross-sectional study [MeSH]'],Verplegingswetenschap,"Rationale: The implementation of pressure ulcer (PU) guidelines is often not performed in daily practice and adherence is low. PUs represent a major burden to patients and have a negative effect on quality of life. The low level of adherence for PU prevention indicates a continued need for quality improvement. In 2019, the PU guideline was revised, and will be implemented in 2020. An essential first step of implementation is to assess barriers and facilitators, according to healthcare professionals (HCPs) working in institutional healthcare organisations in the Netherlands.
Aim: To investigate the barriers and facilitators, according to stakeholders, for implementation of the revised pressure ulcer guideline in healthcare organisations in the Netherlands.
Methods: The study had a cross-sectional design. We collected data from HCPs (n=89) based on the Measurement Instrument for Determinants of Innovation (MIDI) in healthcare organisations in the Netherlands. Descriptive statistics were used to explore participants characteristics. MIDI items to which ≥20% of participants (totally) disagreed were regarded as barriers and items to which ≥80% of participants (totally) agreed were regarded as facilitators for implementation. Applicability about the recommendations of the revised guideline were asked. Open-ended questions were analyzed by theme.  
Results: Reported barriers to implementing the PU guideline were related to the own organisation like time. Reported facilitators were mainly related to the user like knowledge. Additionally, HCPs expressed the need for clarity of the recommendation about the European classification system. Also the recommendation about changing body position every 4 hours was not feasible.  
Conclusion: An overview of the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of the PU guideline in the Netherlands is given. More barriers have been found.
Implications of key findings: The results of this study will be used to develop strategies for implementation."
"An exploration of the experiences, motivations and expectations of patients with advanced cancer, without any standard options, during phase-I trials.","['Sasse van IJsselt, M.E.A. van']","['Oldenmenger, W.H.', 'Biessen, A.J. van der']",2020-09-07T18:00:32Z,en_US,"['Phase-I clinical trial, advanced cancer, expectations, experiences, motivation’']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Title: Patients’ experiences, motivations and expectations during oncological phase-I trials 
 
Background: Patients who enroll in a phase-I clinical trial, may have therapeutic misconception, therapeutic optimism and are often motivated by other people, like their family and doctor. Despite side effects these patients continue to participate. Little is known about the experiences, motivations and expectations when they continue participation in these trials. 

Aim: To explore the experiences, motivations and expectations of patients with advanced cancer, without treatment options, during phase-I trial participation. 

Methods: A generic qualitative study in which ten semi-structured interviews were thematically analyzed according to Braun and Clarke methodology. 

Results: While most participants were pleased they could perform their daily activities again, they also experienced side-effects and burden. Burden such as being confronted with the fact that they have no regular treatment options and experiencing mental and physical fatigue. All participants got their motivation from controlling the outcome, to do good for one another and living in harmony. Participants who just enrolled only tended to look into the future in the short term, while participants who had several tumor evaluations dared to look further into the future.  

Conclusion: Participating in phase-I trial is a great uncertainty. Participating creates the feeling that they tried everything and they are treated to the limit. This not only gives the motivation to continue participating but also a sense of altruism. Family and friends, hope, realism, optimism and helping to develop a new drug also provide motivation. Despite different burdens, side-effects and the feeling of being a test-subject, the participants will not easily choose to stop participation, in order to prevent to say afterwards: ""If only I had"".  

Recommendation: It is recommended to discuss end-of-life care, burdens and motivations during phase-I trial."
"Home care nurses’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards influenza vaccination","['Jongen, J.T.']","['Huis, A.']",2020-09-07T18:00:31Z,en,"['Nurse, Home care, Influenza, Vaccination, Attitude']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Title: Home care nurses’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards influenza vaccination.
Background: Infectious diseases, including influenza, are creating a significant burden of disease on both patients and the healthcare system. Since nurses are key vectors in the spread of influenza, vaccination in nurses is an effective way of prevention. Previous research on this subject has focused on different settings, little is known about the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of home care nurses.  
Aim: To explore the knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards influenza vaccination.
Method: A quantitative, descriptive study using an online, cross-sectional survey was conducted among Dutch home care nurses between March - April 2020. A translation of the King’s Nurses Influenza Vaccination Questionnaire was used to question; knowledge about influenza and the influenza vaccination, perception of the risk, health beliefs, practices regarding influenza vaccination and, reasons to get or not get influenza vaccination. SPSS Statistics version 25 was used to conduct data analysis using descriptive statistics, chi-square test and one-way ANOVA. 
Results: The vast majority of the 449 respondents was not vaccinated for seasonal influenza over the last 12 months (n=358, 79,7%) or the last 5 years (n=318, 70,8%). A significant difference was found between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups in years of work experience, age, knowledge, perceptions, intention to get vaccinated next year and recommendation of vaccination to clients. 
Conclusion: The vaccination rate among home care nurses is low, representing a quite negative attitude towards influenza vaccination. This attitude is related to their age, work experience, knowledge level, perception of risk of influenza and intention to recommendation of vaccination to clients in the future.
Recommendations: By implicating these findings in education programs and motivational campaigns efforts should be made to improve the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of nurses."
Physical Activity Levels in Esophageal Cancer Prehabilitation,"['Griekspoor, M.']","['Dronkers, Dr. J.']",2020-09-07T18:00:33Z,en,['esophageal cancer; prehabilitation; cluster analysis'],Fysiotherapiewetenschap,"Background: Esophagectomy is associated with poor outcomes in esophageal cancer patients. Prehabilitation programs can improve physical fitness to reduce poor outcomes after esophagectomy. However, tailoring the level of exercise program to individual patients is recommended due to differences between patients in physical fitness and adherence to prehabilitation. This can be facilitated by identifying subgroups of esophageal cancer patients based on levels of physical activity during prehabilitation.     

Aim This study aimed to 1) identify subgroups of esophageal cancer patients based on level of physical activity during prehabilitation, 2) determine differences in improved physical fitness within and between the identified subgroups after prehabilitation.

Methods: A cross-sectional design was used for the primary aim and a longitudinal design for the secondary aim of this study based on data of the ‘Preoperative intervention to Improve outcomes in Oesophageal cancer patient after Resection’ (PRIOR) study. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed with data of preoperative exercise reports to identify subgroups of esophageal cancer patients based the level of physical activity. Physical activity was measured by four clustering variables regarding; level of aerobic exercises, level of resistance exercises, performed MET-minutes per week, and self-experienced levels of fatigue. Results of the Steep Ramp Test, Chair Rise Time Test (5x), and a subscale of the Research and Development-36 were used to determine differences in improved physical fitness between and within the subgroups after prehabilitation via Kruskal-Wallis tests, and paired samples t-tests.

Results: In total, data of 61 participants was used for the hierarchical cluster analysis. Three subgroups were identified: the fit subgroup, the frail subgroup, and the fatigued subgroup. Kruskal-Wallis Tests did not show statistically significant differences in improved physical fitness between the subgroups after prehabilitation. Paired samples t-tests showed statistically significant differences in improved VO2max and physical function within two subgroups after prehabilitation.

Conclusion and key findings: This study identified three subgroups of esophageal cancer patients. The study showed no differences between subgroups in improved physical fitness after prehabilitation. Esophageal cancer patients improved in cardiorespiratory fitness and physical function after prehabilitation compared to baseline outcomes."
"Patient experiences of shared decision-making in nursing care, during hospital admission: A qualitative, descriptive study","['Wegman, J.L.']","['Reinders-Messelink, H.A.']",2020-09-07T18:00:38Z,en,"['Shared Decision-Making, Patient Centered Care, Patient Experiences, Nursing, Hospitalization']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Title
Patient experiences of shared decision-making in nursing care during hospital admission:
A qualitative, descriptive study
Background
Shared decision-making is a process in which care professionals help patients making choices in care. The nurse-patient relationship, exchange of knowledge about care options, and values and preferences of patients are starting point for shared decision. In historically grown care contexts, shared decision-making is not jet quite obvious. 
Aim 
Aim of this study is obtaining better insight in current experiences of patients with shared decision-making during hospital admission.
Method
A qualitative research design was applied. Research took place in the North of the Netherlands. Participants hospitalized in the period of February 2019 until February 2020 were included. They were eighteen years or older, Dutch speaking and capable of taking part in research. Sixteen interviews were base for thematic analysis. Interviews were transcribed and anonymized. (Peer-)reviews were part of the procedure.
Results
Seventeen participants were approached and interviewed, of which one interview was excluded. The importance of shared decision-making is obvious, but not self-evident. Nurse and patient working together in a care-relationship towards decision-making, patients’ need to be seen as unique person, experiencing healthcare as entering a system and the importance of nurses’ roles in shared decision-making, are the main themes arising from analysis. 
Conclusion
Although Shared Decision-Making can affect patients deeply, it is not always applied. Recognizing a choice can be made, following steps of the shared-decision process and getting in-depth understanding of patients, sometimes seems difficult to coexist with daily work processes and nurse routine.
Recommendations
Findings could be used for further research into care-relationships related to shared decision-making, and into shared decision-making process during short hospital admissions. Also, creating opportunities within the constraints of healthcare systems need to get attention.

Titel
Patiëntervaringen met het samen-beslissen in de verpleegkundige zorg tijdens ziekenhuisopname: een kwalitatieve, thematische analyse
Achtergrond 
Samen-beslissen is een proces waarbij zorgprofessionals patiënten helpen keuzes maken in hun zorg. De verpleegkundige-patiëntrelatie, informatie uitwisselen over zorgopties, en waarden en voorkeuren van de patiënt zijn uitgangspunt voor samen-beslissen. In de historisch gegroeide zorgcontext is samen-beslissen niet altijd vanzelfsprekend.
Doel
Doel van dit onderzoek is beter inzicht krijgen in patiëntervaringen met samen-beslissen in het verpleegkundig domein, tijdens ziekenhuisopnames.
Methode
Een kwalitatief onderzoeksdesign is toegepast. Patiënten in Noord-Nederland, opgenomen in een ziekenhuis tussen februari 2019 en februari 2020 zijn gevraagd voor dit onderzoek. Participanten waren tenminste achttien, Nederlandssprekend en tot deelname in staat. Zestien interviews vormden de basis voor de thematische analyse. Interviews werden getranscribeerd en geanonimiseerd. (Peer-)Reviews maakten deel uit van de procedure.
Resultaten
Zeventien participanten zijn geïnterviewd, waarvan één interview is geëxcludeerd. Het belang van samen-beslissen blijkt evident, maar in de praktijk niet vanzelfsprekend. Het samenwerken van verpleegkundige en patiënt in een zorgrelatie ten behoeve van samen-beslissen, de uniciteit van de patiënt inzien, de gezondheidszorg als systeem en het belang van verpleegkundige rollen, zijn de belangrijkste thema’s voortkomend uit de analyse.
Conclusie
Ondanks dat samen-beslissen een patiënt diep kan raken, is samen-beslissen niet altijd het geval. Het herkennen van een keuzemogelijkheid in de zorg, het volgen van de stappen in het proces van samen-beslissen en te komen tot een diepgaand begrip van de patiënt, lijkt in de praktijk soms moeilijk met de dagelijkse werkprocessen en routine samen te gaan.    
Implicatie van belangrijkste bevindingen
Uitkomsten van dit onderzoek kunnen geïntegreerd worden in vervolgonderzoek naar zorgrelaties en naar het proces van samen-beslissen tijdens korte ziekenhuisopnames. Ook het creëren van mogelijkheden voor samen-beslissen binnen de beperkingen van de gezondheidszorg verdiend aandacht.

Experiences of Moral Distress Regarding Life-Prolonging Treatment in Outpatient Nurses,"['Steenbergen, M.']","['Jongerden, Dr. I.P.', 'Francke, Prof. A.L.']",2020-09-07T18:00:37Z,en,"['Moral Distress, Nurses, Outpatient Clinic, Life-Prolonging Treatment, End-of-Life-Care, Morele spanning, Verpleegkundigen, Polikliniek, Levensverlengende behandelingen']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Outpatient nurses are confronted with life-prolonging treatment in the last stage of the patient’s life. Literature suggests that nurses lack involvement in the decision making of life-prolonging treatment and may experience moral distress, which is negatively associated with compromised care and job satisfaction.
Aim: To explore whether nurses in the outpatient clinic experience moral distress in situations where nurses are involved in life-prolonging treatments of adults with a short life expectancy or frail elderly and whether moral distress is due to not being involved in the decision making about these life-prolonging treatments.
Method: A qualitative design using semi-structured interviews with nurses working in the outpatient clinic. Recruitment was based on purposive sampling, but limited due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Interviews were guided by a topic list and started with a case description. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis.
Results: Interviews with 12 outpatient nurses (5 registered nurses and 7 nurse specialists) led to four themes: i) involvement in the decisions about life-prolonging treatment, in which nurses felt dependent on the physician, ii) experiences of moral distress, which seem to occur if nurses experiences doubt regarding the decision for life-prolonging treatment, if nurses doubt whether the patient’s wishes were met or when nurses felt unheard or overruled for their opinion to stop life-prolonging treatment, iii) experienced consequences for patient care, in which some nurses withdrew from care, and iv) experienced support, when nurses shared their feelings about the decision making process and moral distress.
Conclusion and implications: This study gives a first impression of moral distress in outpatient nurses. It is recommended to involve nurses into the decision making regarding life-prolonging treatment and to facilitate opportunities to share feelings regarding the decision making process and moral distress.


Introductie: Poliklinische verpleegkundigen zijn betrokken bij levensverlengende behandelingen van patiënten in de laatste levensfase. De literatuur suggereert dat verpleegkundigen niet betrokken zijn bij de besluitvorming hierover en mogelijk morele spanning ervaren. Morele spanning heeft negatieve gevolgen voor de kwaliteit van zorg en werktevredenheid.
Onderzoeksvraag: In hoeverre ervaren poliklinische verpleegkundigen morele spanning wanneer zij betrokken zijn bij mogelijk levensverlengende behandelingen van patiënten met een korte levensverwachting of kwetsbare ouderen, en is deze morele spanning gerelateerd aan het wel of niet betrokken zijn bij de besluitvorming voor de levensverlengende behandeling?
Methode: In deze kwalitatieve studie zijn semigestructureerde interviews gehouden met verpleegkundigen die werkzaam zijn op de polikliniek. Doelgerichte sampling werd toegepast, maar werd bemoeilijkt door de COVID-19-uitbraak. Een topiclijst werd gebruikt voor de interviews en elk interview begon met een casusbeschrijving. Interviews werden opgenomen, getranscribeerd en geanalyseerd middels thematische analyse.
Resultaten: Interviews met 5 verpleegkundigen en 7 verpleegkundig specialisten werkzaam in de polikliniek hebben geleid tot vier thema's: 1) Betrokkenheid bij de beslissingen over levensverlengende behandeling, waarbij verpleegkundigen zich afhankelijk voelden van de arts; 2) Ervaringen van morele spanning als a) verpleegkundigen twijfels hebben over de levensverlengende behandeling, b) verpleegkundigen twijfelen of aan de wens van de patiënt is voldaan en c) verpleegkundigen zich ongehoord voelen in hun mening om levensverlengende behandeling te stoppen; 3) Gevolgen van morele spanning voor patiëntenzorg, waarbij sommige verpleegkundigen niet meer voor de patiënt konden zorgen; en 4) Ervaring van steun wanneer verpleegkundigen hun gevoelens over het besluitvormingsproces en morele spanning deelden.
Conclusie: Deze studie geeft een eerste indruk van morele spanning van poliklinische verpleegkundigen. Het wordt aanbevolen om verpleegkundigen te betrekken bij de besluitvorming over levensverlengende behandelingen en hun gevoelens met betrekking tot morele spanning te delen."
Early motor development and exercise capacity association in children with a congenital heart disease: An explorative study,"['Broeders, W.H.M.']","['Sprong, M.C.A.', 'Brussel, M. van']",2020-09-07T18:00:36Z,en,"['congenital heart disease, cardiac surgery, motor development, exercise capacity, aangeboren hartafwijkingen, motorische ontwikkeling, inspanningscapaciteit']",Fysiotherapiewetenschap,"Background: Several studies report a high prevalence of abnormal cerebral findings in newborns with a congenital heart disease (CHD), frequently resulting in delayed motor development. Additionally, reduced exercise capacity is often observed in children with CHD and both motor development and exercise capacity decline with increased severity. As peak exercise capacity is a strong predictor for mortality, early identification is of great clinical value. However, assessment of exercise capacity can only be objectified by exercise testing from approximately the age of 6. Motor development outcomes however, seems to be an independent predictor of exercise capacity and may be used as an early predictor of decreased exercise capacity. 

Aim: The primary aim of this study is to determine whether there is an association between motor development at the age of 3.5 and exercise capacity between 6 and 7 years. Additionally, association between motor development and exercise capacity between 6 and 7 will be determined. Motor development change over time will also be described. Lastly, we will explore whether exercise capacity is influenced by clinical characteristics. 

Methods: Pediatric patients with various types of CHD from the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital in Utrecht were recruited. Motor development was tested with the MABC-2 at 3.5 years and BOT-2 and exercise capacity was assessed between 6 to 7 years, respectively. Correlations were determined to assess associations and univariate analysis was applied to determine the influence of clinical characteristics on exercise capacity. 

Results: Thirty-five patients participated in this study. A weak correlation was found between motor development at 3.5 years and peak exercise between 6 and 7 years. Correlation between motor development and peak exercise capacity between 6 and 7 years was moderate. Motor development change over time was high. No clinical characteristics were significantly related to peak exercise capacity. 

Conclusion and key findings: Only a weak correlation was found, with no characteristics related to peak exercise capacity. Motor development was highly variable over the course of three years and consequently extensive follow-up should be part of usual care in patients with CHD. Future research should examine the association in a larger cohort of patients with CHD."
The influence of technological tools on Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and Quality of Life in older adults with a cognitive impairment: A single group pretest-posttest,"['Menting, M.M.']","['van Gaal, Dr. B.']",2020-09-07T18:00:38Z,en,"['Cognitive impairment, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Quality of Life, technological tools, pretest-posttest']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: The growing number of older adults is accompanied with an increase in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. In independent living, the ability to perform Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) is critical and has an impact on the experienced quality of life (QOL). Technological tools could support in maintaining IADL and QOL. 
Aim: This study determined the influence of technological tools after one year of use on IADL and QOL in older adults with MCI or mild dementia living at home.
Method: A pre-experimental, pretest-posttest, study was performed using data from another study. Used data was collected at the participants’ home with questionnaires. With the Wilcoxon Signed-rank test IADL and QOL was compared between pretest and posttest. 
Intervention: Participants used one or more technological tools of preference in the categories orientation, day structure, social contact or safety.
Results: Fifty participants were included in pretest and seven participated in posttest. No statistical significant difference was found in the demographic characteristics between the pretest group and the group who had a posttest. The participants (n=7) had a statistical significant decline in IADL performing in comparison to pretest (p=.042). The results on QOL showed no statistical significant difference (p=.866).
Conclusion: A decline in performing IADL can be seen as a normal process in MCI and dementia and not necessarily caused by technological tools. The experienced QOL remained almost the same and is not in line with the normal decline in QOL in MCI and dementia. The findings suggest that people with MCI and dementia are likely to benefit using technological tools in daily practice.
Recommendations: Further research with larger sample sizes is recommended. Including a control group could exclude other influences like regular care in the Netherlands."
PREDICTION OF PHYSICAL OUTCOMES OF THE MULTIMODAL PREHABILITATION PROGRAMME IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER (PREDICT PREHAB),"['Dalen, D.H. van']","['Verdaasdonk, E.G.G.', 'de Man - van Ginkel, J.M.']",2020-09-07T18:00:38Z,en,"['prehabilitation, colorectal cancer, physical fitness.']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Title: Prediction of physical outcomes of the multimodal prehabilitation programme in patients with colorectal cancer (PREDICT PREHAB).
Background: Worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) has a high incidence. To reduce the postoperative complication rate after CRC surgery, prehabilitation was introduced. Prehabilitation is defined as “the process of enhancing functional capacity of the individual to better withstand the stressor of inactivity”. It is unknown which CRC patients benefit most of the prehabilitation programme.
Aim: To explore which patient factors can predict the physical outcome of a multimodal prehabilitation programme in preoperative patients with CRC.
Methods: A retrospective, single-centre, observational cohort study, including all patients who completed the multimodal prehabilitation programme prior to colorectal tumor resection between October 2018 and March 2020 in a Dutch teaching hospital. The primary study outcome was the change in the six minute walk test (6MWT). The secondary study outcome was the change in the leg press one repetition maximum (1RM). Logistic regression was performed to identify predictors for the physical outcome of the programme.
Results: In total, 89 patients were included in the data analysis. The median (IQR) change in the 6MWT and the 1RM were respectively 36 (39) meters and 21 (18) kilograms. The strongest predictor for a ≥50m change in 6MWT was alcohol consumption, corrected for American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade. In the secondary outcome, the strongest predictor for a ≥20kg change in 1RM was the baseline 1RM, corrected for tumor location.
Conclusion and implications of key findings: There were no statistically significant predictors of a ≥50m change in 6MWT. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size. Alcohol cessation should be kept as part of the prehabilitation programme. Patients with an average baseline 1RM, might benefit more of the programme."
Participation in nursing documentation: an interview study among home care patients,"['Douma, J.']","['Francke, Prof. dr. A.L.', 'de Groot, drs. K.']",2020-09-07T18:00:37Z,en,"['Nursing documentation, patient participation, electronic health record, home care, experiences']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Patient participation contributes to the quality of care and patient satisfaction. Giving patients access to their health record strengthens patient empowerment which could enhance involvement. This study strives to expand the knowledge of participation of home care patients in nursing documentation to contribute to the quality of home care.
Research questions: 
1. To what extent do home care patients want to participate in nursing documentation? 
2. Which barriers and facilitators do home care patients experience regarding their participation in nursing documentation?
3. In which ways has a family caregiver to be involved in nursing documentation, according to home care patients?
Method: Qualitative study. The study is partially based on eight semi-structured interviews with home care patients and additional analysis of eleven previously conducted semi-structured interviews. The transcripts were analysed by the method of thematic analyses by Braun and Clarke.
Results: Four themes were identified: patient related factors, working methods of the nursing staff, the role of the family caregiver, and barriers and facilitators: the patients’ condition and the digital system. Patients who want to participate in nursing documentation find it important to check the information and to be informed about their physical and mental condition. Some patients don’t want to participate, they see it as a burden or simply don’t feel the need to. 
Conclusion: The needs of home care patients regarding to participating in nursing documentation differs. Most patients find talking about the written information most important, while other patients want to have access to the documentation and read it themselves. 
Recommendations: Nurses should discuss with patients how they want to participate in nursing documentation. More research can be done on how to facilitate patients who cannot participate in nursing documentation due to their physical condition."
An exploration of the face validity and feasibility of the translated ZELF training guide to home care. A qualitative study,"['Dijkstra, J.']","['Zwakhalen, S.M.G.']",2020-09-07T18:00:37Z,en,"['Function Focused Care, home care, face validity, feasibility']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Nurses tend to take over tasks and need to change their behaviour to support older people in physical activity. In the Netherlands, a generic Function Focused Care-intervention for long-term care was initially developed for a nursing home to encourage nursing staff to engage older people to preserve and optimize physical activity. One part of this intervention consists of multiple trainings led by a training guide. 
Aim: To explore the face validity and feasibility of the translated training guide to home care.
Method: A qualitative generic descriptive study was conducted. A working group translated the training guide to home care. Two expert panels participated in focus groups as well as semi-structured interviews to explore the face validity and feasibility of the draft training guide. Data were analysed using deductive content analysis.
Results: The draft version of the translated training guide to home care included three meetings. Analysis yielded five themes applicable to face validity and feasibility. Themes were: General expectation of new training, impression of the training guide, training guide contents, missing items and conditions for implementation. 
Conclusion: The training guide has the right order and looks relevant for clinical practice. It makes nurses more aware of the current situation. Findings show the composition and content of the training guide needs to be reviewed and further developed to eventually achieve a behavioural change in clinical practice.
Recommendations: To ensure the feasibility and generalization of the training guide, it should be pilot tested into a wider population of home care nurses from different home care organizations."
Methane Emissions from the Dutch Wadden Sea,"['Mesdag, K.I.']","['Röckmann, T.']",2020-08-21T18:00:29Z,en,"['Methane, Wadden Sea, methane oxidation, methane isotopic signature']",Climate Physics,"Methane is an important greenhouse gas, with a greenhouse warming potential that is 34 times higher than for CO2 over a 100 year horizon. Anoxic sediments, containing a lot of (degrading) organic matter, are sources of methane. However, the majority of the methane released from the sea floor is oxidized to CO2 in the water column and does not reach the atmosphere. In the Wadden Sea a lot of organic matter is present and the waters are shallow, potentially allowing a lot of methane produced at the sea floor to be emitted into the atmosphere. Methane concentrations in and above the Dutch Wadden Sea and methane emissions from the Dutch Wadden Sea have never been measured before.  To quantify the methane emissions from the Dutch Wadden Sea, methane concentrations in the water, the sediment and the atmosphere, methane oxidation rates in the water, isotopic signatures of methane in the air and water, and methane emissions were measured together with meteorological information and water properties. These variables were measured at an 48 hour station where the research vessel, the Navicula, anchored during summer (July 2019) and autumn (November 2019).  Average methane emission rates determined with a bucket technique were 6.5 ± 6.3 nmol/s (23 ± 22 nmol/m2/s) in summer and 2.0 ± 1.0 nmol/s (7.1 ± 3.5 nmol/m2/s) in autumn. Based on methane isotopic signatures in air samples, taken from the bucket, and in water samples, it can be concluded that the emissions measured originate from biogenic processes in the Wadden Sea. Emissions calculated with the bucket techniques are larger than the calculated sea-air flux based on dissolved and atmospheric concentrations, but both show the similar temporal changes, indicating that the bucket emissions are representative for what happens in the atmosphere, but the response is magnified. Measured methane emissions are higher at higher dissolved methane concentrations. Based on the sea-air flux, it can be concluded that higher salinity, water and air temperature, wind speed, roughness length and lower methane concentrations in the atmosphere also cause higher methane emissions from the Dutch Wadden Sea. Dissolved methane concentrations in autumn peak just after low and high tide. For dissolved methane concentrations of about 20 nmol/L and higher, methane oxidation rates increase with concentration. The higher oxidation rates result in isotope enrichment of the dissolved methane in these samples, and the observed fractionation constant is consistent with microbial oxidation as the main removal process. Dissolved methane concentrations and methane oxidation rates in summer are, respectively, about four and eight times higher than in autumn. Patterns in atmospheric methane mixing ratios and isotopic signatures in air samples cannot be explained by the temporal cycles of the variables measured during this research project. They are likely caused by passing synoptic-scale plumes with enhanced methane mixing ratios, but this could not be proven in this report. Future expeditions to the Dutch Wadden Sea, during which the same variables are measured, could reduce uncertainties still present after this research project, for example on emission rates and their variation over a year. In addition, measuring the isotopic signatures of atmospheric air samples could help identifying the origin of the methane elevations in the atmosphere."

This also requires the assessment of the changes in tidal and wind waves with a rising sea level. For this, an existing shelf model (Delft3D-SWAN) is used, and applied to model the evolution of tidal sand ridges on the Belgian continental shelf. These ridges are subject to change in mean sea level and related changes in tidal and wave forcing with time. First, the changes in tides and waves as a result of SLR are quanti?ed through nesting of the shelf model into a larger-scale North Sea model (called DCSM-ZUNO). Second, starting from an alongshore uniform and sloping bottom, the shelf model is run in absence of SLR, until mature tidal sand ridges develop on the shelf. Finally, these ridges were used as a starting point for assessing morphodynamic changes due to SLR or differences in tidal and wind wave forcing. Different SLR scenarios were explored, using rate of SLR over the last century (2 mm/yr), the current rate of SLR (3:3 mm/yr) and different SLR rates derived from IPCC projections (3,3 mm/yr, 4,5 mm/yr, 5,4 mm/yr and 11 mm/yr). Model results show that on the Belgian shelf a larger water depth, resulting from SLR, causes the tidal wave to travel faster and to have a larger amplitude, while the tidal current amplitudes decrease.
The signi?cant wave height and the peak wave period increase with a rising sea level, while the wave orbital velocity slightly decreases. The weakening of tidal currents and wave orbital velocities results in a decrease of sediment stirring at the bed. When imposing present-day conditions for waves and tides, the tidal sand ridges are able to keep pace with the rising sea level, even for the most extreme SLR scenario (11 mm/yr). When the effects of SLR on waves is imposed on the boundaries, the off-shore migration of the tidal sand ridges is reduced. However, the ridges are still able to keep pace with the rising sea level. Finally, when the effects of SLR on both the waves and tides are accounted for, the tidal sand ridges can keep pace with SLR, up to a SLR rate of 11 mm/yr, where the growth rate is lower than the rate of SLR."
"Changes in Arctic vegetation, precipitation and its effects on carbon emissions from thawing permafrost in the 21st century","['Hoogland, H.D.']","['Röckmann, T.', 'Tuinenburg, O.A.']",2020-08-21T18:00:27Z,en,"['permafrost, arctic, ecosystem change, vegetation change, precipitation, evaporation, moisture recycling, methane']",Climate Physics,"Context: The rapidly changing climate in the Arctic induces changes in Arctic ecosystems. The thawing of the permafrost may release large quantities of greenhouse gasses that accelerate warming even more. The Pleistocene Park aims to preserve the permafrost by restoring the ecosystem of the Pleistocene: the mammoth steppe. This will change the evaporation of the region, which will in turn change precipitation downwind. As the release of CH4 from permafrost depends on the water table depth, this will also change these emissions.
Aims: In this thesis, I determine the degree of change in precipitation for the Arctic in various future scenarios. In some of these scenarios the tundra is completely replaced by mammoth steppe. An attempt to translate the precipitation changes to CH4 emission changes is also made.
Methods: I use statistical models based on the current distribution of vegetation and evaporation therefrom to make predictions of evaporation in future scenarios. The evaporated water will be tracked using U-track to determine where it precipitates. Upscaling the equation for CH4 emission from Olefeldt et al. (2013) will provide insight in the release of CH4 from thawing permafrost.
Results: The statistical models for evaporation deviate from reanalysis data from GLEAM on average with 20.8%. The precipitation change attributable to vegetation change is found to be much smaller than this average deviation in all scenarios (&lt;5%), and therefore the resulting precipitation estimates are not significant.
Conclusions: Precipitation that evaporated most recently from tundra regions does not fall in regions where the CH4 emission is estimated to be especially sensitive to added moisture. Although no significant estimate of CH4 emission change can be made, the increase in CH4 emission due to the large scale implementation of the Pleistocene Park method is therefore unlikely to exceed the reduction in emissions achieved otherwise."
Lagrangian Pathways and Connectivity in a Reef Canopy,"['Fischer, R.P.B.']","['van Sebille, E.']",2020-08-21T18:00:27Z,en,"['lagrangian trajectories, advection, reef, entrainment, nutrient influx, nutrient efflux, hypoxia, disease spreading']",Climate Physics,"Changing global ocean conditions threaten many tropical reef ecosystems. Affected reefs in turn change the local ocean conditions. Local changes in bottom friction, nutrient availability, oxygen consumption and spreading of spawn and diseases determine the transient response of these ecosystems to changing global conditions. To study the mechanisms causing a decrease in coral cover in many reefs including those in the Caribbean, more detailed models of the complex turbulent flow over the reef seafloor are starting to be developed. This study aims to develop Lagrangian tools to analyze the small-scale transport processes and the network of sedentary organisms, the immobile organisms that depend entirely on the flow. This enables studying the local mechanisms driving past and future reef ecosystem changes. 
Virtual particles are released and tracked in model output of the unsteady flow over a reef canopy. Using a novel scheme for the particle boundary conditions, continuous pathways are traced near the organism surfaces to study the influx and exchange of particles and solutes to and from the sedentary organisms.
The decrease of coral organisms is shown to increase entrainment of water from higher up in the water column by eddies that become larger as the spacing between large coral organisms increases. This also promotes the exchange of particles and solutes between smaller organisms in the wake of larger organisms. Waves interact with the larger spacing between organisms and further increase the eddy size and strength. Waves also increase the length scale of influence for individual organisms."
Holographic description of strongly coupled nodal-line semimetals,"['Claerhoudt, S.J.']","['Stoof, H.T.C.']",2020-08-21T18:00:28Z,en,[],Theoretical Physics,"Nodal-line semimetals contain a line of Dirac nodes in their band structure, where the conductance band and the valence band touch. Electrons in the vicinity of these nodal lines should be described by strongly coupled quantum field theories, since in those areas we are dealing with a long-range Coulomb interaction. We apply the AdS/CFT correspondence to describe such a material. In this procedure, we map a (3+1)-dimensional strongly coupled conformal field theory to a (4+1)-dimensional weakly coupled anti-de Sitter space. This procedure allows us to predict the spectral function of a nodal-line semimetal, which is measurable in experiments. We find that the strong coupling splits the nodal line into infinitely many nodal lines. When we use semiholography to couple the holographic Green's function to the noninteracting Green's function, we find a spectral function which obeys the ARPES sum rule."
Dynamics of the Equatorial Boundary Layer: A comparison of equatorial wave theory and observations,"['Schiller-Weiss, I.Z.']","['Maas, L.R.M.']",2020-08-21T18:00:28Z,en,"['Equatorial wave dynamics, phase speeds, Radon transform']",Climate Physics,"The equatorial region (+/- 2 degrees in latitude) differs from the mid-latitude regions in that there is the presence of strong zonal jets, known as equatorial deep jets. The overarching goal of this thesis is to search for eastward propagating waves that may either be explained by or produce these strong zonal currents. Equatorial zonal jets are traditionally thought to be driven by east to west surface winds, which create a pressure gradient between the eastern and western boundaries resulting in these underlying currents. As equatorial jets are stacked, with a westward, very shallow surface current and eastward undercurrent at about a 100m depth, it is ambiguous as to whether these zonal mean flows lead to instabilities in the form of waves or vice versa, whether the waves actually play a role in driving these currents. The first part of the thesis reviews the theoretical models used to describe equatorial wave theory: the linear approach assuming the beta plane approximation versus the non-traditional approach, which includes the full Coriolis term. Phase speeds for different types of waves are obtained from the dispersion relation using the two approaches.
The second part analyzes satellite sea surface height anomaly data to obtain phase speeds of propagating equatorial ocean waves and uses a spectral analysis to obtain information on spectral peaks. A 2D Fourier transform is applied to create a filter where only eastward/westward propagating signals are isolated. The focus is on eastward propagation as the Equatorial Under Current may steer waves eastward. Alternatively eastward moving waves may be rectified and drive this eastward propagating jet. By gaining insight into the properties and types of eastward moving waves, the mechanisms driving the eastward zonal jets may be more tangible, as most of the observed equatorial waves appear to propagate zonally. The Fourier filter is followed by a Radon transform to precisely determine observational phase speeds, which are then compared to theoretical phase speeds to identify different wave types. Pacific ocean wave speeds were higher on average for all frequency bands in comparison to the Atlantic and Indian oceans. When the annual cycle was removed, the presence of a mode 1 classical Rossby wave, lacking meridional nodal lines, was found in the Indian ocean. Equatorial Kelvin waves were found in the Pacific ocean at the tri-annual and 70 day cycle. A gravity and westward propagating mixed Rossby-gravity wave were found only at the 25 - 40 day period band in the Atlantic. The presence of eastward propagating Rossby waves was not confirmed from the observational data sets, however examples of classical waves were obtained."

State changes in Mediterranean ecosystems,"['Stokking, R.V.']","['Baudena, M']",2020-08-23T18:00:10Z,en,[],Liberal Arts and Sciences,"Wildfire activity is increasing due to climate change as are global temperatures and drought. Mediterranean ecosystems are highly prone to wildfire and when disturbance is large enough state shifts can occur including deforestation. Plant types have different responses to disturbance: Seeders perish but regenerate from seed banks while resprouters can survive and generate new shoots from dormant buds. In this thesis, transitions between different vegetation types based on these fire response strategies are analyzed in the San Francisco Bay area. SPSS analysis were conducted using vegetation data from 1940 and 2010 as well as data on large wildfires, altitude and local climate to determine possible correlations between these variables. Significantly more state transitions occurred in areas where wildfire was present compared to where it was not. Additionally, succession from shrubland to resprouter forest occurred less often under the influence of wildfire. In general the results show state transitions in mediterranean ecosystems to be complex processes affected by a large variety of factors. Mediterranean ecosystems are likely to respond to increases in wildfire activity and more vegetation change is expected to occur in the face of increasing climate change. Future research using more detailed vegetation and wildfire data over larger time scales will provide more insight into the dynamics of vegetation and wildfire."

Spatial and Temporal Wader Distribution Related to the Environment on an Intertidal Shoal in the Oosterschelde,"['Dekker, D.H.J.']","['Philippart, C.J.M.', 'Walles, B.']",2020-08-24T18:00:20Z,en,"['wader distribution, tidal flat, spatial, temporal, Roggenplaat, Oosterschelde, environmental factors, holistic bird counting, wader behavior, foraging ground, dunlin, oystercatcher, bar-tailed godwit, curlew, grey plover, red knot, sanderling, redshank']",Marine Sciences,"Intertidal areas in the Oosterschelde estuary decreases due to a disturbed sediment-balance caused by construction of a storm surge barrier and two compartmentalization dams. The intertidal area provide valuable foraging ground for the benthivore wader populations of the East-Atlantic Flyway. In 2019 seven nourishments were constructed at the Roggenplaat intertidal shoal to mitigate loss of foraging area and preserving wader populations. We study abundance of waders at the Roggenplaat prior to nourishment construction in a spatial and temporal manner and its relation with environmental factors to be able understand natural distribution of the waders and to evaluate the selected nourishment locations regarding interference with natural wader distribution. Relation between wader abundance and environmental factors like exposure time, food availability, and sediment composition increases understanding of the impact of drivers behind natural patterns in wader abundance. 

This study uses intertidal shoal covering bird counts that are obtained by counting from a boat that makes three two-hour tours (period 1, 2 and 3) around the Roggenplaat on 25 counting days. Bird counts were executed from one hour after high tide up to one hour after low tide. All waders that are protected by Nature2000 regulations for the Oosterschelde are studied. Environmental data of the Roggenplaat were obtained by combining tide gauge and LIDAR measurements for exposure time and collecting field samples at 113 stations for benthic infauna abundance and sediment composition. Spatial hotspot maps of foraging wader density were created for each period to find most important foraging ground of each species. Hotspots of foraging behavior were related to spatial differences in environmental conditions by comparing mapped data.    

The results show that significant temporal differences are present within a tidal cycle since less birds are counted from one hour after high tide up to three hours before low tide (period 1) than from three hours before low tide up to one hour after low tide (period 2 and 3). Spatial density hotspots and the periodic movement over the intertidal shoal of each species are divergent. Moreover, environmental factors show different relations with each species. Significant higher densities in areas with short exposure time are found for Dunlin, Bar-tailed godwit, Grey Plover, Sanderling and Common Redshank during low tide. Furthermore, there is an overlap between Oystercatcher, Red Knot, and Sanderling distribution and peak biomass or density of their preferred prey, which was not observed for the remaining wader species. Also sediment composition distribution shows a relation with wader hotspots since Sanderling mainly forage in area with larger d50 sediment grain size, while other species generally ignore this area and use foraging ground with smaller d50 sediment grain size and higher mud fraction. 

Wader behavior differs in a temporal manner since tidal dynamics prevent waders from foraging in low lying intertidal area during ebbing tide. The remaining differences in spatial distribution of wader species are primarily caused by the relation of each species with environmental factors. No obvious relation between benthic infauna biomass or density peaks and wader density has been found for several species. Their distribution is however affected by food availability in another way. Tidefollowing behavior increases prey accessibility, which has been observed for Dunlin, Sanderling and Common Redshank. Distribution of Bar-tailed godwit and Grey Plover shows a relation with polychaeta dominated area despite low total biomass. This indicates the relation between wader distribution and benthic infauna goes further than a direct relation with peak density and biomass.   

Considerable parts of the nourishments at the Roggenplaat overlay valuable foraging ground of most of the studied wader species, which changes the local environmental conditions. It is therefore recommended that selection criteria for suitable nourishment locations should include avoidance of foraging wader hotspots in the future. The impact of these nourishments on the value of foraging ground for wader populations can be defined by studying spatial wader abundance at the Roggenplaat also for the modified situation after construction of nourishments. The outcome should be compared to the natural wader distribution as perceived by our study to identify changes in behavior. Understanding of wader distribution in a spatial and temporal manner and incorporate this knowledge in future nourishment design approach will increase success of human interventions to preserve the deteriorating intertidal area and its valuable foraging ground."
Quantifying Reservoir Outflow Performance in PCR-GLOBWB 2 with the Implementation of the Downstream Demand Allocation Function,"['Streefland, L.B.']","['Van Beek, L.P.H.', 'Wanders, N.']",2020-08-24T18:00:20Z,en,"['PCR-GLOBWB-2, Reservoirs, Water Demand']",Earth Surface and Water,"During the 20th century, anthropogenic reservoirs have been constructed to ensure flood protection and an increasing global water demand. Consequently, natural streamflow timing and streamflow have been altered significantly. Increasing the anthropogenic impact on the hydrological cycle. To understand the feedback between artificial water management and global scale hydrological processes, Global Hydrological Models (GHM) are developed. In this study, a demand allocation function is integrated into the second version of PCRaster GLOBal Water Balance model (PCR-GLOBWB2), which fully integrates water demand at each time step. PCR-GLOBWB2 includes approximately 7000 human-made reservoirs, which are dynamically included according to their construction year, available in the most recently published Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD v1.3) database. By integrating the allocation function it allows the user to study the reliability of reservoirs to provide sufficient release for downstream demand. Initially, downstream reservoir demand was limited to environmental flow, while the integrated function implements irrigational, domestic, industrial, and livestock demand as an addition.
The performance of PCR-GLOBWBs reservoir scheme and the integrated function were tested for 40 globally distributed reservoirs. Performance is validated and compared using output of four model simulations and observed outflow data for a time-range of 31 years (1980-2010). Simulation products include discharge for natural conditions, the implementation of reservoirs, circumstances including reservoirs and initial demand settings, and a combination of reservoir availability and the integrated demand allocation function. 
Error metrics were given for each reservoir on a monthly basis. For twelve reservoirs the Kling Gupta Efficiency (KGE) was positive (>0.0), with maximum performance obtained for Ghost (0.64) and American Falls (0.64). Trends for the components of KGE obtained overestimations for the bias (>1.0, 27/40 reservoirs) and peak values (>1.0, 29/40), and a relatively well performing correlation (>0.5, 18/40). Highest performance trends were predominantly obtained for hydropower and within-year reservoirs, for which the average residence time is less than a year.
The ability of a reservoir to satisfy downstream demand was quantified in cumulative number of months with unmet demand. The allocation derived an average increase of approximately 65 months between the model simulations with environmental flow and allocated demand. Trends for the unmet demand obtained low sensitivity for hydropower and within-year reservoirs, while high sensitivities were obtained for non-hydropower and multi-year reservoirs, for which the average residence time is more than a year.
Both performance and unmet demand were related to the quality of meteorological forcing data. More accurate release modelled is obtained for reservoirs located in more accurately forced river basins. In conclusion, the reservoir scheme resulted in a relatively moderate performance, and the allocation function performed a more realistic representation of the downstream reservoir demand."

The Cenozoic geologic history of the basin is subjected to the oblique convergence between the Indo-Australian oceanic plate to the southwestern edge of Sundaland. The Ombilin Basin formed in the Paleogene and as its origin pre-dates the Mid-Miocene SFS, its basin architecture, therefore, forms an excellent recorder of tectonism in the pre- and early history of the SFS. Since the early Paleogene strata are well exposed in this basin, the Ombilin Basin can be considered as an analogue for other Sumatran basins, especially their syn-rift phase. Using surface geology, detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEM), and subsurface data i.e., 2D seismic lines and exploration wells, the study has been conducted to decipher the initial condition, development, and current interior structures of the basin in response to the regional tectonic settings. The research reveals that the Ombilin Basin originated in the extensional phase of Sumatra since the Early Paleogene to the Early Miocene. The geometry and structural development of the basin was then controlled by the NW-SE inherited structural fabrics, which later inverted since the Mid-Miocene onward during the intensive growth of the Barisan Orogeny. A new model for the basin development is then proposed."

The shallowing of the stratigraphy towards the east, and local lows directly affect the thickness of the overburden. The current strength measurement of 15 MPa is very unlikely representative for the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous sediments. Characteristics are a result of the depositional environment and tectonics. Both the Boekelo and the Gronau fault zone have been a major influence on the regional stratigraphy. During the deposition of the Niedersachsen sediments Europe and America started breaking apart to create the Atlantic Ocean, giving the Niedersachsen deposits their syn-rift nature. This is also likely to be the reason for its heterogeneic character, as the extension created local depocentres. The Altena group was deposited pre-rift in the large Permo-Triassic basin. The limited appearance (both in area and thickness) of these deposits are a result of the erosion that followed the Cretaceous (Sub-Hercynian) inversion."

However, the mere designation of a PA does not guarantee any degree of protection. Where the IUCN Categorizing system classifies PAs solely based on the management strategy on paper, the actual effects of this management remain undetermined. Over the past years, thousands of PA effectiveness methodologies have been developed and applied to PAs from all over the world. However, the majority of the existing assessments are not entirely fit for a quick and easy assessment of the actual quality of the protection in place. Therefore, we propose a new method that assesses the effects of the PA management and thereby reflects the actual degree of protection within the borders of a PA. We present the Protection Level Index (PLI), an index (ranging from 0 to 1) that is based on the scores for 12 equally weighted managerial, socio-economic and ecological sub-indices that are based on both the results from a questionnaire and an analysis of the spatial characteristics of the PA in a GIS. One of the great advantages of PLI is that it omits pre-defining universal optimal conditions and instead allows the PA manager(s) to put numerical quantifications into context. PLI has been tested for 7 European PAs covering a wide range of environmental regimes. The results indicate that some the sub-indices are closely related to each other and that despite the dissimilarities between the 7 PAs, they all have a similar final PLI score in the midrange around 0.63. This emphasizes the unbiased character of PLI, which makes it an ideal protected area management effectiveness method that can be applied to any PA worldwide."

Several recurring cycles were found across all proxies examined in the form of ~3.8m, ~5.2m, ~8.0m and ~19.5m cycles. The ~8.0m cycle was found to be a double ~3.8m cycle and together with the ~5.2m cycle explains nearly all elemental variations found throughout the stratigraphy. The ~19.5m cycle most likely functions as a modulation on the ~5.2m and ~8.0m cycles as the ~8.0m cycles were found to be most dominant with a weak ~19.5m cycle in the middle of the stratigraphy. REE+Y were able to capture a distinct signal throughout the entire stratigraphy, even in sections where Fe/Mn was incapable of capturing clear cycles. The REE+Y showed an antiphase relationship with Fe/Mn while Y/Ho and La were nearly in-phase with it. Y/Ho exhibited an exceedingly high coherence (0.71-0.91) with Fe/Mn at the period considered and was found to most directly respond to changes in continental input and thus climate. Due to the agreement between the cycles found in the Fe/Mn and REE+Y record we conclude that there is a direct climatological control on REE+Y in BIFs."

VEPs are used to foster environmental action within the field of (trans)national environmental governance. Nevertheless, scholars are uncertain which design type of VEP can effectively change firms’ behavior towards the aimed direction. One challenge is to attract participants to the agreement, called uptake, (and have them commit to and comply with the rules), another is to set the strict commitments, called stringency, to a level that would guarantee the VEPs effectiveness. Previous studies have indicated an inherent tension between stringency and the uptake of a program leading to an ineffective voluntary program. Therefore, it is essential to analyze how this trade-off, with suitable strategies, can be resolved to create a voluntary program as effective as aimed to be. The study’s scope was on assessing the first two levels of effectiveness: output and outcome.

This study's methodological approach was a case study on a VEP: the Dutch Agreement of Sustainable Garments and Textile (AGT). This case study was chosen due to the existing trade-off between stringency and uptake. This study had the aim to develop recommendations on how the AGT can be improved in its effectiveness from 2021 onwards. A theoretical framework was developed with indicators that influence the level of effectiveness. Desk research and nineteen interviews were conducted with participants in-and outside the scope of the AGT. The interviews were coded in line with the Grounded Theory Approach (GTA). The results have shown that the level of stringency was scaled as lenient – neutral, and the uptake of the program was scaled as very inclusive, which showed a conflicting result with the actual uptake. Strategies to implement a tier-system of sustainability, intensifying the AGT program, and creating an additional governance structure with the Dutch Government as an orchestrator, were considered the most effective solutions to solve the trade-off between stringency and uptake. Future research is required to expand the theoretical framework to deepen the second level outcome (especially the effect per participant) and examine the third level impact. When the theoretical framework is expanded, it will increase the full understanding of which variables are influencing the level of effectiveness of voluntary programs."
Detecting unwanted consequences of a decreased maintenance condition in the main waterways of drainage areas using predictive machine learning techniques,"['Roos, T.W.M.']","['Wanders, N.', 'Van Vliet, M.T.H.']",2020-08-25T18:00:10Z,en,['Machine learning; Anomaly detection; Stream gradient; Drainage area; Hoogheemraadschap De Stichtse Rijnlanden'],Water Science and Management,"Maintaining the condition of the drainage areas is an important task of the regional water authority “Hoogheemraadschap De Stichtse Rijnlanden”, abbreviated by HDSR. HDSR prefers to monitor the maintenance condition of the drainage areas continuously in order to keep the condition at an acceptable level. However, observing this condition continuously for each drainage area is financially unfeasible. The aim of the study is to develop an approach to measure the maintenance condition of the main waterways of the drainage areas of HDSR in real time. This approach requires the water level difference in the waterways, Δh, as a parameter of the maintenance condition, since Δh is linked to flow resistance. In order to develop the approach, two case studies were performed: one in the Amerongerwetering drainage area and one in the Lange Weide drainage area. During the study, machine learning techniques, such as a linear regression model, a random forest model and a gradient boosting model, were applied. The models required a large input dataset to predict the Δh values. These value were compared to the observed values of Δh. When observing a significant difference between the predicted and the observed values, the date was classified as an anomaly. The data included in the study were provided by HDSR and KNMI. The linear regression model was not suitable for the study, because of insufficient prediction quality. Both the results of the random forest and gradient boosting model showed that most of the anomalies were detected. The anomalies were analysed and were linked to possible explanations. This analysis explained that excessive vegetation has large influence on Δh. The approach proved more promising for the (simpler) Amerongerwetering drainage area, compared to the Lange Weide drainage area. The random forest model proved to be a better performing model, both statistically and visually. The study concludes that machine learning provides opportunities for the water management in the drainage areas of HDSR. However, it is recommended that these opportunities are further examined in future studies."

Most of these studies used mothers in their samples. Although much research has been done on parental self-efficacy, negative discipline and the socio-emotional development of toddlers, little research has been done to identify possible associations between these three constructs, and the influence of gender of the parent is often underexposed. The current study attempted to overcome this knowledge gap by exploring to what extent negative discipline mediates the relationship between parental self-efficacy and the socio-emotional development of their toddlers. In addition, current study also explored if the relation between parental self-efficacy and negative discipline was moderated by gender of the parent. Scales assessing parental self-efficacy, negative discipline and the socio-emotional development of their toddler were administered to both mothers (N = 108) and fathers (N = 60). Results showed that parental self-efficacy predicts their toddlers’ socio-emotional development. The use of negative discipline didn’t mediate this relationship. In fact, no associations were found between negative discipline and parental self-efficacy, nor for negative discipline and the socio-emotional development of toddlers. Neither did gender of the parent moderate the relation between parental-self-efficacy and the use of negative discipline. It is suggested that more research should be done on the relationship between ND – PSE and ND – SED. A possible direction for this is to take another measure for ND."

Eerder onderzoek wijst uit dat intelligentie doorgaans sterk samenhangt met schoolprestaties. Deze samenhang komt echter niet in ieder onderzoek even sterk naar voren. Hierbij lijken omgevingsfactoren, zoals ouderbetrokkenheid, mogelijk van invloed te zijn. Om inzicht te verkrijgen in de mate van invloed van ouderbetrokkenheid, richt dit onderzoek zich op de relatie tussen intelligentie, schoolprestaties en ouderbetrokkenheid. Dit onderzoek test allereerst de aanname dat intelligentie en schoolprestaties positief correleren. Vervolgens is onderzocht of ouderbetrokkenheid deze relatie versterkt. Dit is gedaan middels een cross-sectionele studie, waarbij jonge adolescenten (N = 497) op 12-jarige leeftijd hebben geparticipeerd. De intelligentie is binnen het onderzoek getest door middel van de WISC-III. De schoolprestaties zijn inzichtelijk gemaakt middels een vragenlijst, gebaseerd op het CITO-leerlingvolgsysteem. Ouderbetrokkenheid is gemeten door gebruik te maken van een vragenlijst, gebaseerd op de schalen van ouderlijk gedrag van Statin en Kerr (2000).

Sixty parents with a child between 24 and 48 months (M = 34.53, SD = 6.36) completed a computerized simulation with vignettes of parent-demand noncompliance episodes and child-demand noncompliance episodes. For every vignette, parents were asked to rate their attributions, both parent-causal as child-responsible, on a 6-point Likert scale. They also had to choose one of eight disciplinary strategies, which was most representative of their own reaction in this particular situation. Results indicate that both maternal attributions and disciplinary strategies are partly context-dependent. Firstly, in a child-demand situation, parents were more likely to have dysfunctional parent-causal attributions than in a parent-demand situation. Secondly, results indicate that in a parent-demand noncompliance situation, parents tend to use other disciplinary strategies than in a child-demand situation. Further research on this topic, with a larger sample size and a more heterogenic sample, is needed to verify the findings. Apart from several limitations, the study contributes to the research on parental attributions and disciplinary strategies, as it is one of the first to show that the context of a parent-child conflict plays a role in dysfunctional attributions and disciplinary strategies."

been dedicated to finding transdiagnostic maintaining processes that may serve as targets for 
intervention. In light of this, the current study aims to investigate whether worry explains the 
effect of intolerance of uncertainty (IU) on eating disorder (ED) pathology in AN patients. 
Due to its unique relation with worry, the current study examined prospective IU (i.e., a 
subtype of IU) specifically. The current cross-sectional study is part of a larger study 
conducted by a highly specialized ED treatment facility in the Netherlands, and included 
participants who were 18 years and older, female, and had an AN diagnosis (N = 178). 
Participants completed self-report measures for prospective IU, worry and ED pathology at 
the facility. Results of the regression analyses showed that IU is positively associated with ED 
pathology, and that worry fully explains this relationship. However, the explanatory value of 
IU and worry for ED pathology scores was relatively low. Thus, their clinical relevance seems 
dubious. Nevertheless, the current study is the first to demonstrate an indirect association of 
IU and ED pathology in AN through worry, suggesting that (some) AN patients may benefit 
from intervention targeting such underlying transdiagnostic vulnerabilities."

Plausibility of pathways for landscape development in peat meadows: An exploration of the Amstelscheg case study.,"['Helden, L.B.J. van']","['Dieperink, C.']",2020-08-25T18:00:17Z,en,"['soil subsidence, adaptation pathways, peat meadows, water management']",Water Science and Management,"Large parts of the Western Netherlands, including the so-called Green Heart (Groene Hart), consist of peat meadows. Soil subsidence occurs in these areas, mainly as a result of oxidation of peat above the artificially lowered groundwater level. Soil subsidence causes increased vulnerability to flooding, economic losses due to damage to homes and infrastructure and increased emissions of greenhouse gases. Therefore, governments are exploring sustainable approaches to reduce soil subsidence in peat meadows.

Currently, land use determines which water management is needed. In 2019, a design study was carried out for the Green Heart examining what would happen if water management were to be set up to stop or reduce soil subsidence and CO2 emissions, while the land use would adapt. In this same study, a case study was carried out for the Amstelscheg, for which two future scenarios were developed: Production landscape & Nature landscape. In the first scenario, agriculture remains the primary function in the area, but with more nature-inclusive agriculture, paludiculture and submerged drains, to reduce soil subsidence. The second scenario assumes maximization of biodiversity and active peat recovery, by transforming current agricultural use into nature.

There are numerous projects on tackling soil subsidence in the Green Heart, but implementations and upscaling are difficult to initiate. The route to implementation is also absent in the design study containing the two future scenarios. This study therefore focuses on what strategy can be followed to implement these future land use scenarios. One way of providing insight into what possible measures can be taken to prevent soil subsidence is by creating an adaptation pathway. This can help policymakers to decide which measures need to be taken and when. In scientific literature this adaptive approach has not been used before in the context of soil subsidence due to peat oxidation. This knowledge gap is addressed in this study.

The aim of this study is to identify the plausibility of pathways for landscape development in the Green Heart. Plausibility depends on the suitability and feasibility of a pathway. First of all, it was studied what pathways are, what pathways are used for and what the limitations of pathways are. Subsequently, a stakeholder analysis was carried out to determine which actors are important in the Amstelscheg and what their formal tasks, competences, interests, goals and problem perceptions are. The selected stakeholders were interviewed about their future visions for peatlands, the scenarios and what is needed to realize these future visions. The results of the interviews were compared in order to arrive at the most plausible pathway. In addition, a roadmap was created that provides insight into how the implementation of the pathway can be achieved.

The results show that the production landscape is preferred by most stakeholders. A combination of agriculture in a much more extensive form, places where meadow birds can breed, and possibly places where paludiculture is practiced. In addition, this study shows that within the water system there should be more focus on controlling drought and not only on controlling floods, as is still often the case in the Netherlands. Moreover, the results showed that a step-by-step approach is preferable compared to a transformation overnight, and the adaptation pathway approach can be a valuable method in this respect. Although defining tipping points proved to be a challenge for adaptation pathways in the context of soil subsidence, the method is useful for identifying different measures, prioritizing these measures and planning them over time."
"A Feasibility Study on Water Conservation Measures in Kota Lama Site, Semarang, Indonesia.","['Putri Handayani, .']","['Paul Schot, P']",2020-08-25T18:00:17Z,en_US,[],Water Science and Management,"Worldwide population growth and economic development has increased freshwater demand, and at the same
time has threatened its availability. Poor management of freshwater resources has caused freshwater demand
to exceed its supply, which is known as freshwater scarcity in terms of quantity. Especially in developing
countries, a lack of awareness has led to a decrease of freshwater quality – i.e., an increase of freshwater scarcity
in terms of quality. Nowadays, freshwater scarcity is not only experienced by arid and semi-arid regions but also
by tropical wet regions such as the region where Kota Lama Site, Semarang, is located. This small city called Kota
Lama Site, has been suffering from freshwater scarcity for many years, yet this scarcity has not been
acknowledged by local inhabitants and the city government of Semarang. The plan of Semarang’s government
to include Kota Lama Site on the list of UNESCO world heritage, made the city government initiate the Kota Lama
Site revitalization plan in 2016. Since then, the city has attracted millions of visitors annually, and the number of
commercial businesses has considerably increased (23 %). The economic growth of Kota Lama Site could lead to
a more severe freshwater scarcity if Semarang’s government remains idle in recognizing this issue. Throughout
the world, especially in developed countries, the water conservation concept has been proven to reduce
freshwater scarcity. This concept is primarily intended to preserve freshwater quality, to reduce freshwater
demand, and to conserve freshwater for efficient uses.

Studies regarding water conservation measures for Kota Lama Site is lacking, although freshwater scarcity has
become a pressing issue for this city. This study represents the first attempt in searching for the most feasible
water conservation measures for Kota Lama Site by: analyzing characteristics of its freshwater scarcity,
investigating potential water conservation measures based on its implementation challenges and freshwater
scarcity characteristics of Kota Lama Site, and performing a scoring for selected potential water conservation
measures to determine which measures are most feasible. The selection of feasibility criteria is conducted prior
to the scoring. These criteria are determined in such a way that it represents vital elements that need to be
considered by four different categories of freshwater users in Kota Lama Site, before implementing a water
conservation measure. Because, although the city government of Semarang is responsible for the
implementation and management of water conservation measures, the focus potentially shifts towards
collective action and individual responsibility.

This study reveals that freshwater scarcity characteristics of Kota Lama Site relate to: (1) the lack of freshwater
supply (-23.117.367,95 L/year) from the regional drinking water agency which is known to be of poor quality; (2)
a supply deficit of groundwater (-255.104.525,09 L/year) in the confined aquifer; (3) the unusable supply excess
of groundwater (188.172.656,36 L/year) in the unconfined aquifer; (4) unutilized annual high rainfall (above
2.000 mm/year); (5) ill-defined regulations; (6) weak laws and regulatory enforcement; and (7) unawareness of
freshwater users regarding efficient freshwater use. Selected potential water conservation measures cover the
need of Kota Lama Site’s for: (1) strong laws and enforcement of regulations; (2) programs to raise the awareness
of local inhabitants; (3) actions to strengthen institutional and community capacity; (4) funding and its allocation
for water conservation; (5) an improvement of freshwater quality; and (6) a decrement of wasted freshwater.
Finally, this study recommends that roof-water harvesting and educational incentives are the two most feasible
water conservation measures for Kota Lama Site."
The perceptions of different customers towards collaborative partnerships and sustainability in the supply chain - A case study of Trouw Nutrition,"['Visch, R.I.']","['Vaskelainen, T.']",2020-08-25T18:00:16Z,en,['Supply chain collaboration; Collaborative innovation; Sustainability in supply chains; Customer perceptions; Agri-food supply chain; Collaborative partnerships'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Supply chain (SC) collaboration with the aim to innovate can play an important role in solving various sustainability issues in the agri-food sector. However, many companies fail to have successful collaboration because of misconceptions and differences in perceptions between the SC members involved. Little research is found combining the perceptions of current collaborative partnerships and how sustainability perception can affect these. Besides, to resolve the issue of misconceptions and failure of SC collaboration, including collaborative innovation, it is relevant to study the different perceptions of SC customers. Hence, this research is aimed to get a better understanding of what the perceptions of different customers in the agri-food SC are towards collaboration, including collaborative innovation, in the present partnership. Besides, by studying the perceptions towards sustainability a better understanding can be obtained on how sustainability affects the present partnership and how it can be promoted. For this qualitative research, 20 interviews were conducted with customers from four different customer groups of the animal nutrition company, Trouw Nutrition. The findings show that the perceptions of the different customer groups towards the present partnerships are based on three dimensions (intrinsic considerations, external drivers and partnership criteria), which consist of elements that are considered as important for collaboration and collaborative innovation. The findings indicate that on an abstract level the different customers find similar elements important to the present partnership. However, more specifically for collaborative innovation, differences occur in which elements are important amongst the customer groups. Besides, it is observed that the customer groups differ in their opinion on the importance of collaborative innovation. Furthermore, findings show that the different customer groups perceive sustainability in different ways. Based on the three dimensions identified in the present partnership, it is observed that sustainability perception can affect (negatively or positively) the feasibility of addressing sustainability in partnerships and it became clear that sustainability can be promoted in two ways. First sustainability can be promoted by anticipating on existing intrinsic considerations towards sustainability, and second by external drivers that are required to stimulate them towards sustainability. These findings contribute to gaining insight in what is found important for collaborative innovation, which can be used to create more effective partnerships. Also, useful insights are given in how sustainability can be promoted which is especially relevant for the agri-food sector as this sector is challenged in enabling to feed the future sustainably."
Looking back on a short-term mission: stakeholder narratives on development,"['Leeuw, K. de']","['van Noorloos, Femke']",2020-08-25T18:00:18Z,en,"['short-term mission, voluntourism, development, narratives']",Sustainable Development,"Since the 1960s and 1970s, youth missions arose and over the decades short-term missions have become increasingly popular. Young adults favour short-term missions over long-term missions, because they prefer to participate only for a short amount of time. With this increase in popularity of short-term missions amongst young adults, a new actor in development arose. Young adult, religious volunteering groups are important to take into account when discussing the development landscape, because it enhances the understanding of the development landscape in its totality.

Voluntourism is very present in the literature, but short-term missions and the link between development aid and religion is less frequently studied. The way people think about development co-constructs their development efforts and therefore this thesis looked at the narratives about short-term missions, development and daily life changes of volunteers that participated in or provided a short-term mission. Moz Kids served as a case study for this research and participants of their short-term missions participated in this study. Additionally, managers of All Nations Mozambique, the receiving organisation connected to Moz Kids, shared their thoughts on development and short-term missions. The narratives of these stakeholders were gathered by digital interviews. Besides that, a content analysis was performed on the website of Moz Kids.

The volunteers feel like they have contributed to development by helping out at the orphanages, either by taking care of the children or building a baby house. Where the volunteers speak of the short-term mission with a helping goal, the receiving organisation speaks of it as a learning experience. Indeed, the volunteers vowed afterwards that they have learned several things and that they have made changes in their daily lives. However, the group could be divided in two: a group that made small changes in daily life and a group that made no changes at all. The sending organisation is in the middle between the volunteers and the receiving organisation and therefore speaks of a helping as well as learning experience.

Concludingly, the volunteers feel like they have contributed to development through their presence at the orphanages but also by continued support after their short-term mission. Their ideas regarding development aid have changed and a preference is given to small-scale projects of which the local community directly benefits."
Enabling circular business model innovation for plastic waste solutions: collaboration between incumbents and startups,"['Kortbeek, L.N.']","['Henry, M']",2020-08-25T18:00:19Z,en_US,[],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The role of plastics in the circular economy has recently gained attention amongst policymakers, industry and scholars as a result of increased public awareness for the plastic waste issue. Incumbents in the fast moving consumer goods sector are recognized as major contributors to this issue through the production of plastic packaging. Startups are seen as a source of radical innovation and the two parties are often investigated separately, or as competitors in the CE transition. This thesis set out to rather take their dynamics into account in assessing the barriers and enablers for circular business models for plastics in the fast moving consumer goods industry. Semi-structured interviews with circular startups were done to develop a coding framework that was used to assess CSR reports from incumbents. Insights were enriched by expert interviews on the dynamics between startups and incumbents. Results showed that technical barriers are of high importance for both startups and incumbents, which appears to be a specific characteristic of plastic. Collaboration was identified as main enabler and can be divided in the following categories: internal collaboration, supply chain collaboration and facilitated collaboration. Strategic partnerships along the value chain enable innovation and provides opportunity for startups to provide technical solutions for challenges faced by startups. Also, standards for circular use of plastics and metrics and systems for impact measurement could be established through collaboration. Furthermore, collaboration between startups and incumbents could enable collaborative learning . This creates understanding of what each other’s contribution is to the CE transition, it enables mutual sense making and can have a positive effect on the introduction of new beliefs and values with incumbents and it build mutual trust. It is therefore argued that startups-incumbent collaboration is a self-reinforcing mechanism and accelerator of the transition to a CE for plastic. Further research to validate this hypothesis is recommended."
"Awareness, Attitude & Adoption of Sustainable Product-Service Systems: A mixed method study on the influence of Social Capital on young, Dutch consumers.","['Nijeboer, E.T.']","['Janssen, dr.

This innovation is getting more general acceptance by society. To empower the diffusion of S.PSS, it is interesting to understand the adoption of S.PSS on a social level. The social capital, which are all social contacts of an individual, plays an important role in decision making for an individual, and eventually in adopting new innovations. This research focusses on the influence of bonding (e.g. family and friends) and bridging (e.g. colleagues and neighbours) social capital on the individual’s awareness, attitude, and adoption of S.PSS. A mixed method research design is applied, using a survey (n=292) to receive information around S.PSS from young Dutch customers, and 20 additional interviews to enrich the survey results. Results imply that the social capital has different influences on the individual’s awareness, attitude and adoption of S.PSS. The adoption of S.PSS by the  social capital of an individual relates to the adoption of S.PSS by the individual, especially that of their bonding social capital. The bridging social capital has influences on the adoption of S.PSS as well, but more in specific cases. Social capital helps the individual to become more aware about S.PSS, in this case the adoption of S.PSS by friends and colleagues are especially useful. The attitudes towards S.PSS are formed through sharing experiences and encouragement from friends and colleagues with whom they have shared attitudes regarding sustainability and non-ownership. Thus, the diffusion of S.PSS happens through a variation of bonding and bridging social capital, creating awareness, sharing attitudes and adopting S.PSS more easily. Interesting avenues for further research are generation gaps and the diffusion of S.PSS in cities."
Hybrid Floating Wind and Solar Plants for Small Island States and Remote Communities: Synergy or Wishful Thinking?

This is due to the high costs incurred to transport fuels to their often-remote locations which also exposes them to fluctuations in global energy prices and any changes in geopolitical relations. SISs and coastal RCs are also very vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Nonetheless, electrifying SISs and RCs is no easy feat due to the considerable technical challenges encountered in extending stable transmission lines to their locations, their financial difficulties and developmental state, the generally high initial costs of renewable energy technologies, the limited onshore space available in SISs, the variable nature of wind and solar resources, the steep continental slopes of SISs and the dependence of their people’s livelihood on their natural environment. 

This research seeks to investigate as to whether offshore floating hybrid wind and solar plants may constitute a solution to electrifying SISs and RCs domestically, in a more environmentally-friendly yet affordable manner. This is done by seeking to confirm or dismiss the hypotheses that when compared to separate systems, Hybrid Energy Systems (HESs) can exploit cost synergies due to the sharing of management and infrastructure, reliability (correlation between system output and electricity demand profiles) synergies stemming from the partial balancing of more than one Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) system, and environmental synergies as a result of the occupation of an overall smaller area by the systems. Using the Maltese Islands as a case study, the findings of this study resolve the research question driving this research: ‘To what extent can Small Island States such as Malta and Remote Communities benefit from hybrid floating wind and solar energy systems and how would an optimal hybrid system in Malta look like?’

This is achieved through stakeholder interviews, direct contact with relevant entities, literature review and the running of energy system simulations and optimisation using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) Model under different scenarios and configurations. The techno-economic outcomes and their analyses are presented, analysed and compared primarily using their Net Present Value (NPV), Payback Period (PBP), storage or supplementation capacities they require and their Levelized Cost Of Electricity (LCOE), among other criteria. These are complimented by a series of sensitivity analyses and a short environmental impact evaluation to get a comprehensive understanding of these systems. 

The cost and reliability benefits that SISs and RCs may exploit by installing offshore floating solar-wind HESs as opposed to solitary offshore floating solar and wind systems are confirmed in this study. This research also defines the likely format, key components and probable techno-economic performance of optimal offshore floating solar-wind HESs around the Maltese Islands, thus answering the research question. It also outlines several areas meriting further research. Nonetheless, given the specificity of most of the parameters modelled, these results are liable to change with any major technological shifts or site modifications."

These changes are particularly concerning in the tropics, because this region houses over half of the Earth’s biodiversity. One of the most threatened regions is southwestern Ethiopia, as part of the Eastern Afromontane biodiversity hotspot, where many biodiverse Afromontane forest areas have been converted to agricultural land. Here, the local human population is highly dependent on the natural resources that are provided by the forests. In turn, mammals raid crops in the agricultural land outside of the forests, which is a critical disservice for humans. In order to both conserve crop-raiding mammals and improve human-wildlife coexistence, a better understanding is needed of the spatial and temporal behavior of these crop-raiders in relation to their environment, and apex predator and human disturbance. Little is known about the role of humans on these interactions, particularly in the tropics. This study explores these research gaps and aims at understanding the spatiotemporal activity patterns of two crop-raiding mammals, the bushpig and common warthog, and the leopard, which is the apex predator in the region.Using data from 92 camera traps over 10,894 camera days, generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were built for each species to model their spatial activity, as occurrence, in relation to their environment (using forest cover data), apex predator presence, and human presence. Their temporal activity patterns, in relation to human and leopard presence, are modelled using kernel density functions.GLMMs outcomes showed that there was only one significant relationship between the mammal occurrences and the explanatory variables, which was the positive influence of forest cover on warthog and leopard occurrences. The temporal activity patterns suggest that humans likely influenced the temporal activity of the three mammals, whereas an influence of leopards was again not observed. The latter indicates that the top-down control of leopards on these species was absent. A potential top-down influence of humans was only observed in the temporal activity of the three target species, which suggests that they may separate themselves in time rather than space from human disturbances in southwestern Ethiopia. I discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these results for conservation efforts to improve human-wildlife coexistence and maintain biodiversity, with particular focus on the target species. There may be different mechanisms driving the observed outcomes, which underlines the necessity for future research."
Power in the Short Food Supply Chain:An exploration of Community Supported Agriculture’s Producer Empowerment Capacity,"['Mouskos, K.']","['Kalfagianni, Agni']",2020-08-25T18:00:23Z,en,['power; food transition; rural development; SFSCs; CSA; alternative food networks'],Sustainable Development,"The dominance of the current status quo in the global food landscape, which is characterized by intensive and industrialized agricultural systems and long food supply chains, functions as a source of severe environmental and socioeconomic issues. Therefore, a transition of the global food system is needed. In order for this to happen, the antipode of this aforementioned regime comprised by alternative food networks, with its most promising representative category being short food supply chains (SFSCs), needs to engage in a power struggle with the first.  Nevertheless, the literature on SFSCs lacks depth when it comes to power, as the systematic use of power theory in the field is yet to be adequately explored. Given the above, this research focused on applying power theory to explore one of the most alternative SFSCs type; community supported agriculture (CSA). Specifically, the research aimed to identify the ways in which CSA is able to empower producers in solidifying their transition from the conventional food system (CFS), assuming this was their goal. To do so, a dedicated CSA empowerment framework was devised based greatly on the work of Avelino and Rotmans (2009). The framework conceptualized empowerment, as the ability to mobilize resources, thus exercising power, in a transformative way, meaning a way which challenges the status quo described above. Depending on the kind of resource mobilized an actor can exercise one of the four power types: Ideological, Physical, Political and Economic. The empowerment framework was contextualized in the CSA and different scenarios regarding what can be deemed as transformative exercise for each of the four power types were devised. This contextualized empowerment framework was then applied to 9 CSA farms in the Netherlands, which functioned as the case studies for this research. After the collection of data through semi-structured interviews and desk research, a discourse analysis took place. The results of this analysis were used to answer the main questions of this research, while in addition the farms were evaluated based on their transformative potential, meaning their possible impact to a transition of the food system. The research concluded that despite the significant empowering pathways CSA can provide producers with, including visibility, political influence and independence, the structural obstacles posed by the dominance of the current status quo often prohibit their use, indicating that empowerment needs to be earned through an unfair struggle, in which CSA can only be an enabling tool but not the solution."
Regulatory uncertainty in the voluntary carbon offset market. The case of the carbon offset project developer.,"['Agten, H.B.J. van']","['Vaskelainen, Taneli']",2020-08-25T18:00:24Z,en,"['Carbon offsetting, voluntary carbon market, Paris Agreement, regulatory\nuncertainty, project developer, strategic behaviour, experience']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The voluntary carbon offset market is becoming an important instrument against climate change yet faces an ambiguous future with the introduction of a new global climate regime under the Paris Agreement. With as a result, the project developers in this market are facing substantial regulatory uncertainty. These organisations have been dealing with (regulatory) uncertainties multiple times as they are characteristic for carbon markets. This makes the project developers experts in dealing with uncertainties. However, academic literature has given little attention to regulatory uncertainty in the voluntary market and to how actors experienced in operating in carbon markets cope with this uncertainty. Hence, this thesis aims to examine regulatory uncertainty in the voluntary market and how project developers perceive and respond to this uncertainty. In total, the strategic behaviour of 17 project developers is analysed by conducting qualitative research. This research involved 17 semi-structured interviews complemented with secondary data and observations during a five-month internship at the project developer FairClimateFund. 
This study found that the project developers perceive the regulatory uncertainty as non-threatening. The project developers show great confidence in the future and their ability to cope with the regulatory uncertainty. High market potential combined with their expertise in operating in carbon markets, and for some of them, their independence of carbon markets influence how they perceive and react to the regulatory uncertainty. The project developers show both a general strategic behaviour as three strategic postures in their coping with the uncertainty. With these strategic postures, they pursue a different goal. They either aim to solely follow the developments around the Paris Agreement, build resilience towards the regulatory uncertainty, or influence the outcomes of the regulatory uncertainty. They are found to pursue strategies aiming to avoid, reduce, adapt and disregard uncertainty. The results indicate that actors can choose different strategies with different goals simultaneously with regards to regulatory uncertainty. They tend to use their experiences with previous uncertainties and build on earlier taken strategic actions in their coping with uncertainty. Future research is needed to identify how other actors in the market deal with the regulatory uncertainty or how regional or cultural differences effect the strategic behaviour of project developers."
Multi-stakeholder Initiatives and True Cost Accounting for Sustainable Coffee Production in Colombia,"['Visser, B.']","['Westen, A. C. M. van']",2020-08-25T18:00:22Z,en,"['Coffee, Colombia, Externalities, Multi-stakeholder initiatives, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), True cost accounting']",Sustainable Development,"Coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world in terms of volume and value. The production of coffee takes place mainly in developing countries, where 25 million coffee farmers depend directly on coffee cultivation for their livelihoods. The coffee sector has become crowded with competing VSS; producers have their coffee certified by many standards, which indicates a need for collaboration, an example is the rise of multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSI) in the coffee sector. Likewise, there is an urge to move beyond the focus on the financial benefits of certification as a method to improve value chains to account for the full cost of production.

This research used the Futureproof Coffee Collective (FCC) as a case study, an MSI initiated by a Dutch NGO active in the Colombian coffee sector using true cost accounting (TCA) for sustainable coffee production. The FCC was compared to two other MSIs operating in the Colombian coffee sector, the Sustainable Trade Platform and the SAFE Platform. Interviews and surveys were conducted with Colombian coffee producers and NGOs, and Dutch coffee SMEs, GO and NGOs, to identify the challenges of coffee production for Colombian coffee producers and how MSIs and TCA could contribute to these challenges. The combination of MSIs and TCA for sustainable coffee production has not been researched before. As MSIs are meant for coffee producers, it is investigated MSIs address the challenges coffee producers experience, while also considering the sustainability of these initiatives once the funding ends.

The results show that the main challenges for coffee producers have to do with priceand climate change. MSIs create of learning platforms, develop behavioural standards and standardized management processes. MSIs align stakeholders, which creates synergies as well as funding for impact projects for coffee producers. Though for effectively addressing the needs of coffee producers, they need to be more involved in the decision-making process, as the MSIs are created for their challenges. The results show that the TCA tool can serve as a reporting framework in an MSI through which auditing and compliance of results are ensured. Coffee producers can use the TCA tool as a smartphone farm management tool to leverage their position through transparency. Though when using the TCA tool, privacy should be considered when handling the data."

For this research a case study design was used, wherein the Plastics Pact NL (hereinafter the Plastics Pact) together with its participants were the unit of analysis. The study was implemented through conducting desk research and semi-structured interviews, having a matrix filled out, and informal observations of meetings of the Plastics Pact. Sixteen participants were included in the research, who have participated from the beginning of the pact and together covered the entire value chain. The results illustrate that the Plastics Pact influences the direction, precision of  targets, and scope of plastic strategies, internal business processes (mostly regarding monitoring processes), and connections through the value chain. Currently, interviewed participants are mostly located in the middle of the change process whereby participants have set up a strategy and an implementation plan, empowering broad-based action, and have established some short-term wins. However, these organisations encounter certain organisational, technical, and system barriers to change. System barriers are mostly experienced when participants work towards the recycled content target and the recycling target of the Plastics Pact. Interestingly, not all participants internalised the targets of the Plastics Pact. Hence, the Plastics Pact is recommended to monitor the commitment of all parties and to provide additional stimulus to these organisations, in order to prevent free riding behaviour. Further research could focus on the intra-organisational and inter-organisational changes after the completion of the Plastics Pact. Moreover, the difference in successful completion of EVAs involving sectoral actors compared to EVAs involving value chain actors could also be further explored."
Social business model for sustainable energy - Danish community energy,"['Tran Thi Minh Chau, .']","['Fumagalli, E.M', 'Jacco, F.C.M']",2020-08-25T18:00:25Z,en,"['Community energy, social business']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"This study is initiated by the observation of two phenomena in literature: social business and community energy. The community energy was studied as the grassroots social innovation responding to sustainable energy transition by promoting the engagement of civil actors in the renewable energy setups. Meanwhile, the notion of social business implies a new business form that engages in social missions to capture and deliver social values. The two phenomena share not only the same exhibition in the social embeddedness but also business characteristics since the community energy is guided to enter the energy supply market, directly competing with incumbent energy utilities. However, the understanding of mechanisms for creating, capturing and delivering social values from community energy is still lacking. The thesis aims to deliver a systematic operationalization of community energy by conceptualizing social business in the context of community energy. Four case studies in the Danish community context were analyzed on the components of the social business model, including value proposition, value constellation, social profit equation, and economic profit equation. Based on the findings from the investigation of the four cases, it is concluded that the conceptualization of social business can be reflected in the context of community energy. Their emergence is driven by social and environmental concerns such as the promotion of local empowerment in energy supply, regional development, the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and replacement of fossil fuel resources. Strong community engagement plays a critical role in project emergence and implementation. It reflects on efficient and transparent management of project operators and democratic decision-making process with the involvement of local actors to stimulate project development. The case studies found different financial means to maintain the operation. Most of them rely on the revenue of energy sales to be self-sustained, however, the commitment of the local community to the financial duties of the project proves a more sustainable business model."
Gas in European decarbonisation pathways: future infrastructure challenges,"['Bouacida, I.']","['Eichhammer, Wolfgang']",2020-08-25T18:00:24Z,en,[],Sustainable Development,"The European Union’s target to reach net-carbon neutrality by 2050 calls for deep changes to energy supply, including a sharp decrease in the consumption of natural gas. This master’s thesis evaluates the impact of carbon neutrality on the gas system, taking France and Germany as two case studies. It first identifies the gas trajectory in French and German decarbonisation scenarios, then explores the consequences of carbon neutrality on gas infrastructure and estimates the changes in methane price due to the increase in methane production cost and the decreased use of existing methane infrastructure. Our results show that gas supply and demand will radically change by mid-century, with biomethane, synthetic methane and hydrogen emerging as major energy carriers and input to industrial processes at the expense of natural gas. It appears that infrastructure planning is paramount to the achievement of carbon neutrality,
all the while the issue of infrastructure is little addressed in decarbonisation pathways. A cost simulation is conducted taking two extreme cases for distribution network development. It suggests that methane price could increase up to 72% in France and 98% in Germany between 2030 and 2050 with the increase in methane production cost and in specific infrastructure costs."
Using pattern set mining on Weigh-in-Motion data.,"['Horst, Y.M. van der']","['Siebes, A.P.J.M.', 'Groot, N.']",2020-08-25T18:00:36Z,en,['data mining; pattern mining; pattern set mining; SLIM; K-Means; WiM; Weigh-in-Motion; ILT'],Artificial Intelligence,"This research aimed to answer to which extend pattern set mining can prove to be useful for the Innovation and Datalab (ID-lab) of the Dutch Human Environment and Transportation Inspectorate (ILT). To study this, the unsupervised pattern set mining algorithm SLIM was used. SLIM finds interesting patterns in the data by searching for those patterns that can optimally compress the data. The patterns in question were travel time patterns in Weigh-in-Motion data. This data is relevant for ILT because one of its primary tasks is to inspect commercial transportation vehicles. Weigh-in-Motion systems collect data about vehicles in multiple locations along the Dutch highways. By analysing this data, more can be learned about the particularities of the transportation industry, which is helpful for inspections.
To find these patterns, three approaches were taken. First, using a simplified dataset grouped by license plates, SLIM was compared with well-known clustering technique K-Means. SLIM turned out to be more suitable, as it provided more distinctive results. Second, the dataset was made more complex by addressing the simplifications from the first approach, mainly going from binary to numeric variables. These had to be discretised, so they could be used by SLIM. SLIM still performed well but the resulting patterns were difficult to visualise. Finally, the data was grouped on businesses by adding more variables. The results were modelled as networks to visualise the patterns. This turned out to be a visualisation in which interesting patterns could be found with ease, especially with the filtering tools provided by Gephi.
In conclusion, pattern set mining could prove to be very useful for ID-lab. The new visualisation method using networks made discovering interesting patterns easier and could also be used to find other connections in the data. Interesting travel time patterns were extracted from the data, yet interpretation of the discretised continuous data proved to be challenging."

The existential decidability of power series rings over finite fields,"['Boelens, T.Y.M.']","['Cornelissen, prof.

The first approach to the problem uses tools from algebraic geometry and is described in the article \emph{On the decidability of the existential theory of $\FF_p[[t]]$} by Jan Denef and Hans Schoutens (1999, \cite{denefschoutens}). It is shown that the truth of an existential statement in a ring $R$ corresponds to the existence of a rational point on a scheme over the spectrum of $R$. We study a form of Artin approximation that allows to related decidability in power series rings to decidability in the finite residue field. Finally, we look at the dependency of the results of Denef and Schoutens on the Resolutions of Singularities conjecture.

The other approach is the one described by Arno Fehm and Sylvy Anscombe in the article \emph{The existential theory of equicharacteristic henselian valued fields} (2016, \cite{ansfehm}). Here the problem is studied in the context of the model theory of valued fields. Using results by Franz-Viktor Kuhlmann on a special class of henselian valued fields, it can be shown that the truth of existential statements transfers for a larger class of henselian valued fields with finite residue field, of which the power series ring over a finite field is an example.

Besides trying to understand the details of the proofs in the two articles mentioned above, a short introduction to the relevant fields of mathematics is given."

However, how counterfactual statements can be used to explain a Bayesian Network (BN) is a relatively unexplored topic. Because people generally prefer an explanation where one value is contrasted against another, we want to give an explanation that is both contrastive and counterfactual to explain a certain target variable in a BN. After giving a definition for a contrastive, counterfactual explanation and giving a naive approach of computing all explanations, we first constructed an algorithm to more efficiently find all explanations in an enhanced subset lattice for evidence variables that are binary valued. Secondly we explored how a monotonicity relation between the evidence and the target can be exploited to more efficiently compute all explanations for evidence that is not binary valued. We were able to derive several propositions about the inclusion of evidence variables in an explanation based on the respective ordering of the observed value for the evidence variable and the most probable and expected values for the target. With these propositions we constructed an algorithm that finds all explanations with a breadth-first search through the monotonicity enhanced subset lattice. We concluded our research by providing two different methods of selecting those explanations that are most useful for a user and giving different templates of how the explanations can be presented to the user in a textual way."

This ontology is transformed into the graph of a Bayesian network. An overview of the structure of methods making this transformation is given. Apart from combining existing methods, steps are added to this structure by drawing from the experiences in creating a Bayesian network in this research.

We show that essentially any expected element of the Brauer group can be reached. Using local class field theory we also show that the answer differs when we look at elliptic curves over the ring of integers of a local field over the 2- and 3-adic numbers."

Moreover, the eigenvalues and the behavior of the eigenvectors indicate that the positive z-axis is an attractor. On the other hand, when the parameter is positive, a periodic orbit in the neighborhood of the origin appeared. The periodic orbit was revealed using the averaging method and represented analytically. However, in the NE9 system, nested tori appeared but were demolished at a
range of initial values. Moreover, when the parameter is small and the initial radius is large, a limit set and a chaotic attractor appeared. Furthermore, the existence of a chaotic attractor was shown numerically in the NE9 system. On the other hand, in the NE8 system, we proved analytically and showed numerically that the periodic orbit is an attractor and that several attractors appeared at different values of the parameter."

The research goal of this design science study is to explore this concept and to narrow the research gap in quantitative workaround detection. In a case study at a Dutch hospital, five AGWs are identified through stakeholder interviews. The PM24AGW methodology presents a way to distinguish between workarounds and legitimate process instances through the principle of exclusion. In iterative analysis cycles, patterns of legitimate behavior are captured to reduce false positives and detect workarounds with increasingly high precision, as demonstrated on the five workarounds at the case study hospital. By capturing knowledge about the AGWs in a snapshot, non-malicious AGWs can be addressed to improve the process, after which malicious AGWs will stand out even more. The PM24AGW methodology has empowered the hospital to more efficiently catch and sanction unlawful use of EHRs, making the hospital a safer place for patients."

Using fear to persuade people into performing certain behaviour is a technique known as a fearappeal. It is often used and studied in health psychology, but so far little studies have been done in environmental psychology. A fear appeal usually consist of a threatening component and recommendation with protective action towards that threat. Since health psychology usually targets individual behaviour, this recommendation is aimed at increasing self-efficacy but since climate change is a complex global problem that needs collective action, it is argued that aiming to increase collective efficacy would be more effective. However, in climate change communication a efficacy component is often lacking. Two models that theorize different interdependency for the effects of fear and efficacy are discussed: The Extended Parallel Process Model and The Dual Pathway Model of Collective Disadvantage. Hypothesized is that a fear appeal would increase sustainable intentions and that a fear appeal would have more effect than an appeal with just fear or efficacy. 244 participants were randomly assigned to four conditions in a 2x2 design, where fear and collective efficacy were manipulated. No significant results were found to support the hypotheses, possible due to no significant effects of the manipulations. The influence of the threat of the 2020 coronavirus, as a possible accelerator in the system change needed to combat the climate crisis is discussed, as well as reframing the climate change message and the connection between health- and environmental psychology."

This can be done with a brain-computer interface (BCI) that triggers the stimulation based on real-time measured EEG. However, this is challenging, as algorithmic decision making takes time and brain states are known to change rapidly. One solution here is to forward predict the EEG time series – this enables the BCI to anticipate the occurence of brain states that are suitable for stimulation.

In this thesis we propose two convolutional neural network models for forecasting EEG time series. The first one is an adaptation of the WaveNet model developed for processing audio signals. The second one in turn is a multivariate adaptation of the first one.

We found that our univariate model is better at estimating instantaneous phase of an EEG signal compared to an autoregressive forward prediction model that has been previously used for brain-state dependent TMS. In addition, our multivariate model was not able to achieve more accurate predictions than our univariate model, but it did show slightly improved phase estimation accuracy.

In conclusion, results reported here indicate that deep learning is a feasible approach for EEG time series forward prediction."

This thesis contributes to advancing our understanding of relational global health injustice by arguing there is hermeneutical global health injustice between the Global North and the Global South. Miranda Fricker describes hermeneutical injustice as a gap in hermeneutical resources between the speaker and the hearer, which disables the speaker to interpret and make sense of his or her social experiences (2007). Most analyses discuss local hermeneutical injustice. To illustrate how it is also present globally and specifically in global health, I will provide two examples: paternalism in and the medicalization of global health. Moreover, I will, as a justification for pursuing hermeneutical justice, argue for an ecumenical account of duties from justice that appeals to both cosmopolitans and social liberals. Finally, having outlined the problem and moral basis for the obligation to remedy hermeneutical injustice in global health, I will critically examine Fricker’s normative account of the virtue of hermeneutical justice and advocate for a participatory approach instead."

It was expected that social support is positively associated with PTG. In addition, it was hypothesized that the relationship between social support and PTG is mediated by culture. As expected, results indicated that bereaved, who perceived social support, reported more PTG than bereaved, who perceived less or no social support. Even though results confirmed that bereaved from Turkey perceived social support stronger than bereaved from Germany, results did not confirm that Turkish participants show higher levels of PTG than German participants. Thus, the relationship between social support and PTG was not mediated by the cultural dimension individualism-collectivism. Implications based on these findings were discussed."

One possible approach to investigate these experiences is the analysis of written reports that document individuals’ experiences from the first-person point of view. An attempt at analysing such reports, described in Coyle et al. (2012), tries to predict which psychedelic substance is described based on a Bag of Words representation of the reports. However, this approach doesn’t provide enough meaningful information about the subjective inner experiences that users have. To overcome this limitation, the present research proposes an approach that predicts dimensions of the experiences that express information about the subjective inner state. A small subset of 120 reports in the Erowid Experience Vaults was annotated using a 5 point Likert scale for each of 8 dimensions that were identified as relevant based on Altered States of Consciousness literature. To predict these scores, seven different report representation methods and two types of regression techniques were used to create a total of 14 different models. Reports were represented using Sentiment Analysis, Bag of Words, Word2Vec and Doc2Vec approaches. The latter 3 approaches were also supplemented with Sentiment Analysis information. The most important finding is that all 14 regression models performed better compared to baseline null models in predicting dimensions relating to inner experiences. Furthermore, the models that adhered to word order and used Word2Vec/Doc2Vec techniques made better predictions compared to simple Bag of Words models. Finally, models that were supplemented with Sentiment Analysis information performed better compared to the counterpart models without this information. Additionally, challenges and suggested improvements for this new approach and some observations regarding the data are discussed. Future research could focus on investigating the influence of more variables, e.g. set and setting, on the inner experience.

However, the growing acknowledgement that a right to privacy is an important value has sparked debates about the extent to which no longer relevant personal information should be accessible online. This thought has led to the implementation of a European right to be forgotten. However, journalistic organizations are not subject to this right, as it is commonly reasoned that what they produce, is of public interest. In this thesis, I will partly disagree on this line of reasoning, by arguing that news organizations should, in some cases, respect a moral right to be forgotten in journalism. This moral right would enable some individuals to get a grip about their online reputation perpetuated in journalistic productions. As interest in the news (subject) can decrease over time, the public importance of some publications might no longer be in a justifiable relation with the individual harm that it causes. In other cases, news organizations should respect a moral right to be forgotten to allow individuals to leave past transgressions behind them and start over with a clean slate. Although press freedom and its core incentives -being societies watchdog- ought to be protected, a moral right to be forgotten in journalism that in some cases allows individuals to become no longer traceable to a particular article should be established as it is not likely to affect the holy press freedom. Journalistic organizations that are strongly committed to ethical standards should, therefore, re-evaluate the intrusion in one’s private life versus the importance of the production, when an individual requests so. They should opt for a self-regulatory framework on this matter as they possess the capacities to assess what information is in the public's right to know. In this thesis, I thus will try to balance the right to privacy with the right to a free press, by arguing for a self-regulatory framework that defines which information ought to be protected from a moral right to be forgotten and under which circumstances news organizations should be more inclined to grant an unpublishing request."
Moral requirements for energy sources: Guidelines for decision-making in an energy transition context,"['Smit, A.D.']","['Blaakman, M.', 'Peters, M.']",2020-08-25T18:00:51Z,en_US,['Ethics; Energy transitions; Energy policy; Principle of Generic Consistency; Rights; Capacity for action'],Applied Ethics,"Decisions regarding which energy source to transition to should preferably be based on an objective comparison of different energy sources. To enable this, this thesis examines which moral requirements should be met by an energy source if a society is to decide to implement this source. Eight general requirements that are applicable in all contexts are derived from Alan Gewirth’s Principle of Generic Consistency. This thesis furthermore discusses how moral requirements that specifically apply to an energy transition context can be derived from these general requirements. Moreover, this thesis provides guidelines regarding how to determine which moral requirements should be given priority in case of dilemmas. The main goal of this thesis is to deliver a method which should help energy transition decision-makers to choose the best energy source. Yet while doing so, this thesis also suggests that none of the energy sources currently in existence comes close to meeting all requirements outlined here. As such, this thesis indirectly shows that as a society, we need to improve the way we generate and consume energy."
Pruisen en het liberale Zuidwesten,"['Jong, H. de']","['Lantink, F.W.']",2020-08-25T18:00:53Z,nl,[],Geschiedenis,"De politieke geschiedenis van Baden en van Württemberg in de negentiende eeuw kenden veel overeenkomsten. Het zijn twee middelgrote Duitse staten uit dezelfde regio. Beide staten waren relatief liberaal, vergeleken met de rest van Duitsland. Beide staten werden in 1866 geen onderdeel van de Noord-Duitse Bond en kwamen pas in 1871 in een politieke unie met Pruisen. Toch kenden de twee staten één groot, onderbelicht politiek-historisch verschil; in de jaren ’60 werden weliswaar in beide staten de eerste moderne politieke partijen gevormd, maar in Baden gebeurde dit naar aanleiding van een religieus conflict, in Württemberg werden partijen gevormd over de het vraagstuk van Duitse eenwording. Dit heeft geleid tot totaal andere politieke partijen in Baden dan in Württemberg. Het belangrijkste verschil was dat Württemberg hierdoor een politieke partij met brede electorale steun had die nadrukkelijk anti-Pruisisch was, de Volkspartei. De topprioriteit van deze partij was een Württembergse aansluiting bij de Noord-Duitse Bond te voorkomen. De partij had potentie om daarin te slagen, maar deed dat niet, doordat de cruciale moties in de landdag die voor de Württembergse aansluiting bij Pruisen hadden gezorgd, gemaakt waren in 1867 en in 1870. In 1867 was de Volkspartei nog niet ver genoeg ontwikkeld om het debat te bepalen. In 1870 had het net de verkiezingen verloren.   Partijen in Baden en Württemberg hebben dus geen enorme invloed gehad op het verloop van de Duitse eenwording, maar dat de Volkspartei daar wel heel dichtbij kwam suggereert dat het voltooien van de Duitse eenwording onder Pruisische heerschappij minder onvermijdelijk was dan sommige historici beweren. Daarnaast benadrukt het ook dat Baden en Württemberg niet een en dezelfde rol hebben gespeeld bij de Duitse eenwording, zoals hun overeenkomsten misschien doen denken. In Baden was er niet of nauwelijks oppositie tegen aansluiting bij Pruisen en in Württemberg was deze heel sterk."

Eén van de gevolgen van dit beleid was een gedwongen kinderverhuizing. Nadat het beleid werd afgeschaft ontstond er veel discussie onder historici, politici en juristen over de vraag of er in Australië sprake was van genocide op de inheemse bevolking vanwege de gedwongen kind verhuizing.
In 1997 bracht de regering het “Bringing Them Home’’ rapport uit. Hierin werd de gedwongen kinderverhuizing als culturele genocide gezien. In plaats van duidelijkheid leidde, dit echter tot nog meer discussie tussen voorstanders (Nieuwe Historici) en de tegenstanders (Nieuwe rechtse Historici). 
Deze scriptie probeert de argumenten van de voor en tegenstanders op een rij te zetten. En te concluderen of er wel of niet sprake was van een culturele genocide.
Door middel van literatuuronderzoek met analyse van 7 primaire bronnen en 22 secundaire bronnen wordt een overzicht gegeven van de discussie.
Als eindconclusie kan vastgesteld worden dat er sprake is van een culturele genocide.

In combination with parameterized complexity, we can find algorithms using sublinear memory, where for non-parameterized algorithms it can be proven that we require linear memory. In this work, we investigate a broad range of problems in the streaming setting, including varying approaches to solve them. Different approaches can lead to an interesting trade-off in the number of times we inspect the stream and the memory usage. Hence, we explore both kernelization and direct algorithmic approaches for solving problems such as Pi-free Deletion, Pi-free Editing, Vertex Cover, and Edge Dominating Set. In terms of parameterization, we focus on using the parameter vertex cover, but we will also see solution size and tree-depth being used. We will see a range of upper bound results, which are partially direct adaptations of non-streaming algorithms, and partially new work. We will also see some lower bounds on the memory use given the number of passes we make over the stream."

Under these CO2 reducing scenarios, AMOC collapses in six out of the twenty-four simulations performed. The effect of the AMOC collapse in the emission reduction scenarios is a transient faster response (cooling) in the short term compensates with a slower response to emission reduction in the forthcoming decades. In non-collapsing scenarios, the emission reduction response might have initial conditions dependencies with the AMOC variability."

Inspired by Reinhart Koselleck’s conceptual history program, I examine how the explicit attempts to explain heredity in relation to these social problems interact with the Dutch interwar political culture. By means of a detailed analysis of textbooks and periodicals, as well as inaugural lectures, propaganda material, and specific dissertations, I identify four general trends in Dutch public health discourse centred around social diseases. (i) Throughout the interwar period, public health reformers came to agree that acquired characteristics were not inheritable and that environmental influences acting on the developing body could not alter the genetic blueprint. (ii) Dutch public health reformers increasingly employed heredity to discuss social diseases in relation to development instead of reproductive transmission. (iii) The strongly biologised Dutch interwar public health discourse went along with a big emphasis on environmental—and hence malleable—influences in the constitution of social diseases. (iv) Dutch public health reformers conceptualised the collective as a series of equal individuals. Revealing a focus on individual developmental health and a practical orientation towards improving the environment, I claim that this individualised public health discourse reflected and contributed to the Dutch egalitarian political culture during the interwar years, in which health was regarded as a private matter and collective solutions to social diseases were decentralised and organised bottom-up rather than top-down."

Depending on a divisibility criterion, we get a case distinction into unramified and (possibly) ramified primes. In the unramified case we find a matrix representative of the Frobenius conjugacy class in the Galois group, using information about the endomorphism ring of the reduced curve. We will generalize this to abelian varieties, which introduces some difficulties. Finally, we give a lower bound for the ramification index in the ramified case, using Newton polygons."

We show the original two-dimensional implementation of Lazeroms causes spurious numerical wiggles irregularities to appear on the ice draft. With modifications to the algorithm we show that the melt plume parametrisation can be effectively used as a tool to determine sub-shelf basal melt without causing irregular ice geometries. However we only show that the parametrisation works in this idealised test setup, we strongly suggest that more work needs to be done to evaluate the plume parametrisation in more realistic setups."

power (nPower). Prior research substantiates the belief that individuals high in nPower are more 
prone to develop and optimize prosocial behavior strategies that enable them to exert influence.  
While the power motive has been found to predict a variety of behavioral strategies, no study 
to date has examined the relation with humor ability and its manifestations as a means of 
exerting influence. The aim of the present study is to explore how the implicit power motive 
may be related to the development and expression of humor. By integrating two formerly 
distinct research fields, it was hypothesized that individuals high in nPower differ substantially 
in humor production ability from individuals relatively low in nPower, and are more likely to 
express an affiliative humor style. A total of 138 U.S. participants from the general population 
conducted several tasks and questionnaires. The ‘Picture Story Exercise’ was conducted to 
assess participants nPower. Humor production ability was measured through the ‘Cartoon 
Caption Task’. Finally, participants completed the affiliative humor dimension of the ‘Humor 
Styles Questionnaire’. The results of the present study indicate that power-motivated 
individuals do not substantially differ in humor production ability, however, they are more 
likely to use an affiliative humor style. Finally, concrete recommendations for future research 
are given, that could validate predictive conclusions that cannot be drawn from the present 
study."

However, most of the studies have been mainly conducted in Western cultures and it remains unclear how meaning in life beliefs are associated with meaning-making of loss and grief among different cultures. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between meaning in life beliefs, grief and meaning-making of loss between collectivistic and individualistic cultures. A sample of 306 bereaved German and Turkish participants answered an online questionnaire. The findings of this study reveal that greater meaning in life beliefs were associated with higher meaning-making of loss and less grief. Greater feelings of closeness to the lost one were further related to higher levels of meaning-making of loss. Cultural differences indicate that with higher levels of meaning in life, collectivistic cultures reveal lower levels of grief as compared to individualistic cultures. Additionally, culture does not significantly moderate the relationship between meaning in life and meaning-making of loss. Nevertheless, a trend reveals that compared to Germans, Turkish people report higher 
meaning-making of loss with lower meaning in life beliefs. This study is the first to demonstrate the role of meaning in life beliefs in the psychological adjustment to the loss of the loved one and how this differed between collectivistic and individualistic cultures. By investigating this association empirically, a general understanding concerning the psychological mechanisms will be enhanced, and practical help for individuals with different cultural backgrounds can be provided."

Optimal Fusion in Data-Parallel Languages: From Diagonal Fusion to Code Generation,"['Balen, D.P. van']","['McDonell, T.L.']",2020-08-28T18:00:24Z,en,"['fusion, accelerate, parallelism']",Computing Science,"This thesis investigates the necessary steps to introduce optimal fusion into a compiler for a dataparallel, array based language. Existing literature includes various practical fusion methods, which are based on local rewrites and do not consider the global optimal solution, and methods that are able to identify the optimal fusion clustering. There are no methods that use this optimal clustering to achieve optimally fused code, whilst preserving parallelism and type-safety. In this thesis, we expand upon the latter methods and ensure that the resulting fusion system preserves parallelism and type-safety. The proposed method consists of an integer linear programming formulation to identify the optimal clustering, an explicit fusion AST to encode this clustering
in the abstract syntax tree, and an explicitly loopy intermediate representation to generate fused code. In the process of developing this system, we formalise the concepts of vertical and horizontal fusion, and introduce diagonal fusion. These concepts are used in the explicit fusion AST, and allow us to preserve type-safety throughout the compiler, amounting to a partial proof of correctness. We demonstrate that this approach is viable through a partial implementation in the compiler for Accelerate, an embedded language in Haskell."

First year first generation students coming from vocational education have a higher risk of dropping out in higher applied education (hbo). Opportunity inequality is increasing for these students. This study provides knowledge on the factors that contribute to the further development and reinforcement of the educational resilience for this target group. Insight is gained on the role of higher education institutions and how they can nourish and support educational resilience to reduce both drop-out rates and inequality of opportunities. Method. Semi-structured interviews were held with students (N=5) and educational professionals (N=5) to investigate their experiences with and visions on the role of higher education institutions. Hindering and promoting factors provide tools for higher education institutions to constitute the support of educational resilience. Results. The results show that the biggest obstacle is the uncertainty of these students about their role as hbo-student. Meaningful relationships, social cohesion, a positive future perspective, material resources, diversity in classrooms and contact with role models are hindering and promoting factors. These students indicate that they need personal attention and support in which their home situation and personal circumstances are taken into account. Discussion. Higher education institutions can use the insights from this study to guide these students in their role as hbo-student. Through an intersectional approach attention can be given to the diverse background characteristics of the students that influence their educational resilience. Students can be supported by older students as role models and by making the role expectations of hbo-students explicit."

In totaliteit hebben 233 participanten tussen 12 en 18 jaar met subklinische depressieve symptomen deelgenomen aan de studie. Zij werden gerandomiseerd over de vier condities. In alle condities was sprake van een significante afname in depressieve symptomen, waarbij geen verschillen werden gevonden tussen de condities. De mediatie analyse kon niet worden uitgevoerd, vanwege de afwezigheid van correlaties tussen therapie alliantie en de voor- en nameting van depressieve symptomen. Het volgen van preventieve CGT-training waar de vier componenten aan bod komen leidt tot minder depressieve symptomen. Een betere werkrelatie tussen cliënt en therapeut voorspelde in dit onderzoek geen afname van symptomen. Mogelijke verklaringen en suggesties voor vervolgonderzoek en de praktijk worden besproken."

Existing scientific literature on the relationship between language development and internalizing problem behavior has mainly focused on toddlers. However, internalizing problems can also have profound consequences for school-aged children. This study examined the relationship between language development and internalizing problems in four to nine-year-old children. Besides, the mediating role of effortful control in this relationship was researched. Firstly, it was assumed that receptive language as well as expressive language would be negatively related to internalizing problem behavior. Secondly, it was assumed that both relationships would be mediated through effortful control. Data from 84 Dutch school-aged children were collected through language tests taken with the children and questionnaires filled out by their parents. Results indicated that there were no significant relations between receptive language and internalizing problems or expressive language and internalizing problems. Furthermore, no significant results were found for language development and internalizing problems in relation to effortful control. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that language development and internalizing problem behavior are not related. Strengths, weaknesses and implications of this study are discussed."

It draws on a model-based lesson series on the topic of soap, which was specially designed for the research. The lesson series was evaluated with the use of a pre- and post-test given to 38 students divided over two 6th grade classes. The pre- and post-test tested attitudes and understanding of science. The understanding of science was divided between knowledge on models and knowledge on soap. The soap knowledge questions’ answers were elaborated with the use of a focus group of 5 students per class after post-test. Analysis of the pre- and post-test shows that the attitude of students towards scientists becomes more positive, after the intervention. Also the general understanding of the purpose of models improves during model-based lessons. The understanding of the students was also measured according to Grünkorn’s (2014) framework and this indicated that the 6th grade students have their understanding of the purpose of models in level I. Finally students’ knowledge about soap increased because of the model-based lessons. So, Model-based lessons can therefore increase understanding and attitudes towards science in 6th grade education."

Het doel van dit bachelor eindwerkstuk is onderzoeken wat de invloed is van character narration op de representatie van vrouwelijke adolescentie in beide films. De comparatieve filmanalyse bestaat uit vier deelparagrafen. De eerste drie paragrafen behandelen ieder een thema dat in beide films een significante rol speelt en bovendien relevant is voor het beantwoorden van de onderzoeksvraag: “narratie structuur”, “vrouwelijke seksualiteit” en “opsluiting en ontsnapping”. In de vierde paragraaf wordt een antwoord gevormd op de onderzoeksvraag. De vrouwelijke adolescentie in The Virgin Suicides wordt belichaamd door de vijf Lisbon zusjes. De vertellende instantie betreft een groep van vijf buurjongens. De representatie van de Lisbon zusjes in The Virgin Suicides wordt beïnvloedt door de vertroebelde herinnering van de buurjongens, het frame van de buurjongens en de male gaze van de buurjongens. De zussen representeren een fantasiebeeld dat de buurjongens hebben van adolescente meisjes. In dit fantasiebeeld zijn de zussen gereduceerd tot een combinatie van twee stereotypen die bestaan rondom adolescente meisjes: het lustobject en de damsel in distress. De vrouwelijke adolescentie in Mustang wordt ook belichaamd door vijf zusjes. Het vertellend personage betreft het jongste zusje Lale. De representatie van de Turkse zusjes wordt beïnvloedt door Lale’s kinderlijke POV, haar positie binnen het narratief en haar female gaze. In Lale’s representatie is iedere zus een autonoom individu, elk in haar eigen fase naar volwassenheid. De Lisbon zusjes hebben gedurende het narratief geen autonomie. Op het einde van de film lijken ze met een zelfmoordpact hun autonomie te herwinnen. Dit wordt echter teniet gedaan door een laatste opmerking van de vertelinstantie. In Mustang
daarentegen herwinnen de twee jongste zusjes wel hun autonomie en vernietigen daarmee het patriarchale systeem en de male gaze. Mustang kan worden beschouwd als het antwoord van de feminist counter cinema op The Virgin Suicides, als weerspiegeling van de patriarchale maatschappij."

interaction of Work Engagement, and the Relatedness need satisfaction, within the Maltese 
workforce is being investigated. The Motivational Process of the revised JD-R Model, and the 
Self-Determination Theory are used as theoretical framework. Mediation analysis is used to 
analyse the data of a sample of 198 participants from the Maltese working population. The 
results show a positive relationship between OI and work performance through the full 
mediation effect of work engagement. The satisfaction of the need for relatedness positively 
predicts OI, work performance, and work engagement respectively. Furthermore, the results 
show a partial mediating effect of organisational identification on the relationships between 
relatedness need satisfaction and work performance, and relatedness needs satisfaction and 
work engagement. These findings indicate that within the Maltese workforce, employees are 
driven to perform both through the fit between the values and goals of the organisation, and 
their personal values and aspirations, as well as a workplace that makes them feel as part of a 
community, in which they are able to build meaningful social connections with their fellow

The central purpose of the thesis is to explore how trained attention enables the self to become one with the environment and find the home within it through the lenses of Shinto and Japanese Buddhist thought. Regarding the research methodology, the thesis presents a literature review of religious and philosophical sources connected to the Shinto and Japanese Buddhist traditions. The key ideas are that the self is a combination of five ever-changing aggregates which may be balanced through body-mind cultivation practices. With continuous efforts to strengthen the connection between body and mind, one’s attention is trained and one is able to recognize that one is always embedded in one’s environment and the relationships with the objects within it. In this way the self becomes merged with the surrounding environment and is able perceive the spiritual-material nature of one’s reality. This also makes for one’s ability to perceive awe and wonder in one’s surroundings, which is defined as the state of being at home. In conclusion, attention aids in one to become one with the environment and find the home within it by enabling one to realize of one’s embeddedness in space and cultivating one’s capacity for perceiving awe and wonder in what is often deemed only ordinary and familiar."

Through the study of worship and Bible study as sensational forms, as well the different platforms used, it can be seen that the online community has led to a lack of intimacy and meaningful communication. For some members, it meant that it became more difficult to have religious experiences and a good relationship with God. This leads to the conclusion that being online has distanced people from God."

preference, through policy and law, to specific ways of interaction between genders. Abstracted
from the phenomenon of femonationalism, civic integration policies in the Netherlands are
examined under the framework of public reason as a means of doing so. To grasp the way in
which these policies came to be, a historical embedding is given, which includes notable events
and policies as well as pivotal figures in the political shift of the Netherlands to the right. To
demonstrate the problematic nature of the civic integration policies and programmes, which may
not appear, prima facie, as insidious, the notion of the culturalization of citizenship is presented.
By explaining public reason - via John Rawls, Jürgen Habermas and Akeel Bilgrami - in contrast
to civic integration policies, the policies are shown to be unjust. However, through the case of
Shirin Musa, the benefits of state intervention are illustrated, with the complexities shown
through Rawls and his comments on the family. In conclusion, this thesis finds that states can
only guarantee citizens gender equality to the extent that they can prove that, should there be
forms of gender discrimination, they are involuntary. Should values of a comprehensive doctrine
- religious or irreligious - clash with fundamental tenets of a state, those values should be placed
second, such as gender equality in the face of gender discrimination. As illustrated through civic
integration policies and programmes, this thesis contends that the Dutch state does attempt to
give preference, through policy and law, to specific ways of interaction between genders. The
result of this is a violation of the idea of public reason, insinuative of the implementation of
unjust policy."

It also looks at how well they predict different categories of crime, namely attacks on life, theft, attacks on freedom, sexual offenses and others. This research takes the form of an ecological study using open secondary data provided by different governmental agencies in Geneva. We conducted several multiple linear regressions, examining the relationship between crime and permeability, population density and mixed land use, while adjusting for variables. We found that mixed land and population density indeed have a relationship with crime, however, permeability did not. This provides us with crucial information that will help future urban architects and crime experts work together on future developments."

consequence, municipalities are active in ensuring that older adults can actively participate in society and feel safe. 
The initiator of this research were previous findings of the Verkeersonderneming (transport agency) who conducted 
a questionnaire asking residents in Het Lage Land and Prinsenland, Rotterdam how safe they feel while traveling. 
These results reflected that with increasing age participants feel less safe while traveling (De Verkeersonderneming, 
2020a) Therefore, this result was the starting point of this research and poses the following question: What influence 
do perceptions of safety from accidents, crime, and infectious diseases have on the travel behavior of older adults in 
Prinsenland and Het Lage Land in Rotterdam, the Netherlands? 
In order to answer this question, in-depth interviews were conducted with ten participants aged 55 and older from 
the two neighborhoods in Rotterdam. The main findings were that older adults feel less safe from accidents (falling, 
being hit by a moving vehicle), but this did not impact their travel behavior. In addition, participants avoid traveling 
or avoid areas during darkness when traveling because they feel less safe. Lastly, perceptions of safety from 
infectious diseases changed and more participants used individualistic modes of transportation such as car or bicycles 
during COVID-19 than before. These findings can be useful for researchers and transport agencies like De 
Verkeersonderneming to offer insights into older adults’ perceptions of safety and how they impact their travel 
behavior."

Creativity may be a resource needed to achieve this differentiation. Therefore, it may be worth fostering it. In this research, we set off to find out how the creativity of app designers can be fostered. We proposed a conceptual design for a tool that aims at achieving this objective. The design incorporates two main concepts that are central different fields, namely analogical reasoning and app review analysis. Taking this interdisciplinary approach aimed at tailoring general creativity research to the field in question to effectively support the creativity of the app designer. In essence, the proposed tool presents analogous apps as example solutions to a similar design problem. In line with that, this research proposed a way to describe apps in analogical terms and a method and associated theory to select appropriate analogous example apps. The tool also provides visualisations of features that are automatically extracted from the app reviews for each presented app. The approach proposed in this research combines both human and machine processing in the quest to foster the creativity of app designers.

L'œuvre décrit les intrigues présentes à l’époque de la cour royale normande et donne une vue unique sur les personnages de la cour palermitaine du XIIème siècle. Les Normands sont des descendants de « vikings », qui étaient connus pour leurs nombreuses extensions territoriales. La famille normande De Hauteville a réussi à établir un royaume en Sicile qui dépassait de loin un simple contrôle du territoire. La famille s’est intégrée à la société et a eu quatre générations de domination normande. Cependant, sous les règnes de Guillaume Ier (1154 à 1166) et Guillaume II (1166 à 1169), le royaume se trouva face à des nobles rebelles, en désaccord sur la répartition du pouvoir. C'est dans cette période que le Liber Regno Sicilie ouvre son histoire.
Sur la base des analyses narratives et discursives nous avons révélé des particularités dans le texte à propos du récit et du thème de l’auteur. Ces particularités ont ouvert une partie du message politique de Falcand : la Sicile a besoin d'un roi fort, qui sait quand imposer son régime avec un comportement tyrannique et surtout, quand ne pas l’imposer. L'auteur du LRS avise le lecteur que les dangers de conflits entre les grands hommes de la Sicile et leur égoïsme nécessitent un gouvernement sévère pour les réprimer et maintenir la paix. Cependant, ce n'est pas une carte blanche pour le gouvernement de faire ce qu'il veut : les grands hommes sont également liés par les lois du royaume. Et quand ils ne suivent pas les lois, le peuple a droit à la rébellion.
Bien que les règnes de Guillaume Ier et II soient décrites avec un point de vue négatif, l'auteur décrit également le côté positif de la famille royale : les rois Roger. Ils sont les bons rois et ont apporté la paix au royaume. L'auteur fait une distinction générale entre les différents rois et implicitement nous voyons une préférence subtile au règne de Tancrède : petit-fils de Roger II, fils d'un Roger et père de Roger III. Cependant, cette préférence ne prend pas la forme d’un travail de propagande, mais devrait plutôt être perçue comme une « laus civitatis » persuasive, dans laquelle l’intérêt du lecteur et de l’écrivain sont tous les deux conservés. L'auteur appelle le peuple de la Sicile à penser par lui-même et à agir à l'unisson contre l'invasion de l'Empire allemand.
Quant à l'identité de l'auteur, à partir des données de l'analyse, nous pouvons rayer certains noms et prêter attention à d'autres qui ont été proposés par les chercheurs comme identité de l'auteur. Deux candidats semblent correspondre aux critères proposés dans ce mémoire : l'abbé de Saint-Denis, Hugues Foucaud, ou le frère de l'écrivain français Pierre de Blois, Guillaume de Blois."

By way of a close reading of the novels it will be argued how literature, as a specific form of language usage, can be instrumentalized for the sake of furthering the LGBTQIA+-emancipation in present day the Netherlands. The argumentation draws from recent insights from the field of queer studies, especially the work of Lee Edelman (1998), Heather Love (2007), José Muñoz (2009), Elizabeth Freeman (2010), and Jack Halberstam (2011). These works all connect queerness to the notion of temporality: the relationship between human existence and time. Central to their understandings of temporality are the historical consciousness of homo-, queer-, and transphobia, as well as the hope for a better future for queer individuals. With this approach, I aim to broaden the conceptualization of homosexuality in present day the Netherlands in general, and in Dutch literature, specifically. In recent years, homosexuality in the Netherlands has most prominently been discussed in relation to the uprise of nationalism since the beginning of the twenty-first century, as a result of the war on terror. Furthermore, very little research has been done on Dutch novels with homosexual protagonists that were published after the 1980s. Therefore, the thesis departs from the standpoint that research on homosexuality in Dutch academia so far is often problematic and/or inconclusive. The aim is to help further a context-specific framework about homosexuality in the Netherlands for the (Dutch) humanities in general, and for literary studies and Dutch studies, specifically."
Noir en dessins.

Cette attention pour les personnes noires s'est traduite par la production de dessins de modèles noirs. Dans cette recherche, nous avons tenté de donner un premier aperçu de l'image des personnes noires dans les dessins français réalisés entre 1800 et l'abolition de l'esclavage en 1848. Plusieurs dessins des artistes Nicolas Petit, Eugène Delacroix, Jules-Robert Auguste, Théodore Géricault et David d'Angers ont été étudiés. À partir de l’étude de ces dessins, on peut constater que la manière dont les Noirs étaient représentés de manières très diverses dans les dessins français à cette époque. Alors que Petit a été chargé de réaliser des dessins précis et professionnels de personnes noires destiné à la recherche, Auguste a fait des dessins de femmes noires pour lui-même afin d'exprimer ses désirs érotiques. Delacroix et Géricault, en revanche, ont mis l'accent sur la peau noire qu'ils se sont efforcés de représenter le plus fidèlement possible. Un motif abolitionniste se retrouve également dans les dessins, comme dans ceux de David et de Géricault. Cette variété dans représentation des Noirs s'explique par les motifs choisis par les artistes et la fonction des dessins, ainsi que par le contexte politique, socio-historique et artistique."
The Perceived Reliability of (Female) Narrators in Psychological Thrillers,"['Roggeveen, S.M.']","['You, M.']",2020-08-31T18:00:42Z,en,['Creative writing; narrator; reliability; gender; thriller; genre'],English Language and Culture,"This thesis explores techniques used in the field of creative writing to influence the reader’s perception of the narrator’s reliability. This thesis argues that the perceived reliability of the narrator is created in an interaction between the author, text, and reader, rather than being inherent to the narrator’s characteristics. This is demonstrated through the close readings of the novels The Girl on The Train, Elizabeth is Missing, and Gone Girl, which demonstrate that social subjects such as gender, age and schemas are of influence on the way the reader interprets the reliability of the narrator. Additionally, narrative structures such as the first-person point of view and the epistolary form also influence the perceived reliability of the narrator. This thesis looks at why the reader’s perception of the narrator’s reliability is important in the genre of the psychological thriller. In the three novels that are discussed in the thesis, the reliability of the narrators is perceived for what it is not, which means that the narrator is either trusted by the reader when in fact they are untruthful, or that the reader is distrusted by the reader when they are actually speaking the truth. When the reader finds out their perception of the narrator was wrong, this creates a plot twist, which adds to the shock and suspense that forms the thriller."

Door bestudering van stukken uit de ministerraad en Handelingen uit de Tweede Kamer wordt er een compleet beeld geschetst van alle gebeurtenissen. Uit deze handelswijze moet duidelijk worden of de keynesiaanse stimuleringspolitiek in deze periode daadwerkelijk kan worden aangetoond of van enige nuance moet worden voorzien.

ELF is used as a ‘contact language’ for speakers with different native languages. In this international organization, there is a variety in proficiency and no language policy is currently instated. The study answers the following question: To what extent is successful and efficient communication reached when English is used as a Lingua Franca within the Global team of Atradius Amsterdam? This research shows that while participants may indicate that there are no challenges in the communication, a deeper look into the use of ELF, communication strategies and cultural differences can prove otherwise. Additionally, the extent of efficient and successful communication largely depends on the participants’ ability to solve these issues presented. Two English native speakers, three non-Dutch non-native speakers, and five Dutch speakers are interviewed about their experiences with cultural differences and using ELF, and how this results in challenges or conflict. The results of the interviews reveal that challenges such as high expectations, confidence levels and native languages can complicate the communication process. Dutch is often used amongst Dutch employees as a result of having no language policy. Additionally, while non-native speakers focus both on correctly sending and receiving of messages by using linguistic competencies, native speakers focus more on sending a message intelligibly. Furthermore, Dutch directness can be a source of misunderstanding as Dutch and non-Dutch people seemingly have different perceptions of ‘face’. In the Global team, participants indicate that all challenges in communication are solved, and misunderstanding is hardly ever severe enough to result in conflict. Participants are able to adapt to the other speaker’s level, can fix miscommunication, and transfer any message, despite challenges in ELF and cultural differences. This implies that the team reaches efficient and successful communication. Suggestions for multinational companies include bringing awareness to ELF use and cultural differences, assessing newcomers on their proficiency and implementing a language policy to further improve the in- and external communication."

Aan de hand van theorieën betreffende metaforiek en psycholinguïstische onderzoeken naar schizofrenie wordt er bovendien nagegaan in hoeverre afwijkingen in de mechanismes onderliggend aan de menselijke Theory of Mind aan te wijzen zijn als oorzaak voor deze problemen. Ten tweede wordt er dieper ingegaan op de distinctie tussen conventionele en nieuwe metaforen om de problemen verder te specificeren en na te gaan in hoeverre deze distinctie van belang is om het taalpatroon van schizofrenie te beschrijven. Ondanks dat het onderzoeksveld nog beperkt is laat specifiek onderzoek naar metaforiek en schizofrenie zien dat schizofrenen alleen significant slechter presteren op het begrip van nieuwe metaforen. De voornaamste conclusie die uit deze analyse volgt is dat schizofrenen gezien hun specifieke moeite met nieuwe metaforen er niet in slagen om cross-domain mapping toe te passen. Dit wordt ondersteund door de Career of Metaphor Theory. Het zal in toekomstig experimenteel onderzoek bevestigd moeten worden.

Een medium dat zich actief inzet om kinderen hierover te informeren is het NOS Jeugdjournaal (Timmer, 2017). Voor een meer open samenleving, dienen dergelijke programma’s hun beelden zo inclusief en representatief mogelijk vorm te geven (Ten Thije, ter perse).

De representatie van het buitenland binnen het nieuwsdomein blijft een sterk onderbelicht aspect. Echter, een dergelijk onderzoek is juist nu, in het licht van de genoemde discussie, relevant. In dit onderzoek zijn 50 avonduitzendingen in de periode 2017-2018 van het NOS Jeugdjournaal vanuit een intercultureel communicatief oogpunt geanalyseerd met behulp van kwantitatieve analyses, een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse en een frameanalyse (Entman, 1993; Semetko & Valkenburg, 2000; Van Noije en Wennekers, 2019). Het onderzoek geeft hiermee inzicht in hoeveel tijd er werd besteed aan buitenlandse onderwerpen, welke thema’s hierbij werden belicht en vanuit welk perspectief deze geframed werden. Het onderzoek sluit zo aan bij het academische debat omtrent culturele beeldvorming van de Zelf en de Ander, betekenisgeving door middel van framing en de actieve rol die de media hierin spelen.

Uit het onderzoek is met name gebleken dat de diversiteit van het buitenland ruim vertegenwoordigd werd binnen het NOS Jeugdjournaal. Echter was de aandacht voor dit buitenland duidelijk geconcentreerd op specifieke werelddelen: Europa, Azië en Noord-Amerika. Ook was er sprake van een onevenredige verhouding tussen de Zelf en de Ander, waarbij de Zelf de boventoon voert. Desondanks deed het NOS Jeugdjournaal een geslaagde poging Nederland in een wereldwijde context te plaatsen. Zo werden de blikken van kinderen verruimd door wereldwijde ontwikkelingen te presenteren en kinderen te informeren over de rol van Nederland. 

Om de academische dialoog omtrent beeldvorming verder aan te vullen, kan het allereerst interessant zijn het gecreëerde hetero-image te onderzoeken ten opzichte van het auto-image. Verder kan een interdisciplinaire aanpak inzichten bieden in de visuele clues die bij dit onderzoek onbelicht zijn gebleven. Tevens kan het buitenlandse discours van het NOS Jeugdjournaal verder blootgelegd worden door de ingezette thema’s verder uit te diepen per werelddeel. Ten slotte kunnen de resultaten van dit onderzoek op bredere schaal geïnterpreteerd worden wanneer er in de toekomst vergelijkend onderzoek plaatsvindt voor soortgelijke, buitenlandse journaals."

vorm kreeg bij de talkshows Pauw, DWDD, De Hofbar en Op1 van de NPO tussen 1-10-2019
en 21-02-2020. Een cultural approach (Ten Thije, 2020) vormt het fundament van dit onderzoek
met theorieën over representatie (Leerssen, 2006; Forrester, 2000), groepsidentiteiten (Holliday
et al., 2016; Beller & Leerssen, 2007; Spencer-Oatey & Franklin, 2009; Fitzpatrick, 2019),

Čarapić, 2006) en framing (Lakoff, 2014; Peters, 2017).
Door middel van het kritische discoursanalyse model van Fairclough (1992) werden de
volgende drie dimensies van het talkshowdiscours geanalyseerd: de tekstuele dimensie, de
discursieve dimensie en de sociale praktijk.
Deze drie dimensies werden via diverse analyses geanalyseerd, waaruit een aantal
resultaten naar voren kwamen. Binnen de lexicalisatie-analyse bleken de boeren het meest te
worden geclassificeerd. De predicatie-analyse toonde aan dat de begrepen boer met een positief
imago en de begrepen boer met een negatief imago de beeldvorming voor het merendeel
bepaalden. De sprekers-analyse wees uit dat – in tegenstelling tot de theorie van Fürsich (2010)
- de boeren zelf, als minderheidsgroep, het discours het meest vormgaven. De analyse naar
verwijzingen liet zien dat er het meest werd gerapporteerd naar de boeren, het kabinet en
minister Carola Schouten. Uit de auto-, hetero- en meta-images bleek dat de boeren, als
voormannen van de Nederlandse natie, zichzelf het meest de slachtofferrol toerekenden. De
andere Nederlanders in het discours zagen de boeren meer als rebel, terwijl ze wel begrip voor
de boeren toonden. Echter, bleken de boeren een sterk onbegrip te hebben naar de medeburgers
uit de Randstad.
Hoewel de tekstuele dimensie grotendeels overeenkwam met de sociale praktijk, kwam
de discursieve dimensie niet overeen met de sociale praktijk aangezien het sentiment in de
samenleving niet voldoende werd gerepresenteerd in het televisiediscours. Dat sluit aan bij de
bevindingen van Schoonewille (2016) en Wasser (2019) die aantoonden dat het
televisiediscours van de NPO geen directe afspiegeling is van de Nederlandse maatschappij.
Enkele beperkingen van dit onderzoek zijn dat niet alle talkshows op dezelfde dagen
uitzonden zijn en niet alle dimensies per talkshow konden worden geanalyseerd. Ook kan de
subjectiviteit van de onderzoeker een rol hebben gespeeld bij de interpretatie van de resultaten.
In vervolgonderzoek zou men zich kunnen focussen op een cross-culturele vergelijking van
(televisie)discoursen over de boerenprotesten tussen diverse buitenlandse media."
"Muted masses, strong-willed survivors or just like us? A quantitative and qualitative study of refugee representation by contemporary Dutch ‘radical and progressive’ media platforms","['Weduwen, N.H. der']","['Besamusca, E.']",2020-09-02T18:00:23Z,en,['representation; refugees; Dutch media; discourse; progressive media'],Interculturele communicatie,"The purpose of this research is to discover new developments in representation of refugees in Dutch media, in the context of the ongoing ‘refugee crisis’. This aim was derived from previous MA ICC research detecting a shift from large faceless masses to individual victims in the Dutch media narration (Huisman, 2016, Looije, 2017 and Schüller, 2017). This study bases itself on studies of (media) representation, discourse and ideologies (Stuart Hall, 1997, Fürsich 2010, Van Dijk, 1991) and framing (Entmann, 2007). It also considers Chouliaraki’s study (2012) that theorizes about a reflective discourse, which argues for dialogue with refugees that are represented as non-victimized individuals with their own agency. This reflective discourse is interpreted as predecessor to Foucault’s counter-discourse, which sees marginalized groups creating their own discourse (Moussa & Scapp, 1996). Considering this theoretical framework, the sub- and research questions are oriented towards finding traces of reflective and counter-discourse within Dutch media discourse. A corpus is selected of three radical/progressive media platforms (OneWorld, De Correspondent, and De Groene Amsterdammer) with a total 51 articles that were published in the period 2018-2019. According to Atton (2002), these media are most likely to employ less biased ways of reporting and include refugees in shaping their stories. A quantitative study that counted the number of words given to refugees, determines that refugees are increasingly allowed to tell their own stories as a source. A qualitative study based on the discourse-historical approach (Reisigl & Wodak, 2017, Wodak, 2015, 2001) reveals three categories of refugees that are constructed and qualified through discursive strategies: the refugee as victim; as integrated young professionals and families; and as activists, writers and journalists. The category of victim being the most frequently used is in line with previous research (Greussing and Boomgaarden, 2017, Looije, 2017, Van Dijk, 1991, and Daalmans et al., 2019), but the detection of the other two is a new development. Still, this thesis concludes that while a reflective discourse is somewhat present on the radical/ progressive platforms as refugees, a counter-discourse is not, as journalists are still using refugee sources to push their own stories and arguments. They are not speaking for themselves. This study is limited due to the DHA being applied in an adapted form, which suggests that a different form of analysis might have been more suitable. Recommendations for future research include comparing the results with a corpus consisting of traditional Dutch media in a few years for now, to see if the new categories are part of a larger trend. Visual analysis of photos and illustrations of the used articles is also recommended."

Deze factoren hebben ook invloed op het personeelsbestand van organisaties. Werving- en selectieprocessen worden niet alleen door dergelijke externe, maar ook door interne factoren beïnvloed. Deze studie betreft dan ook een onderzoek naar impliciet en expliciet taalgebruik rondom diversiteit en inclusie in vacatureteksten van charterondertekenaars, zowel uit de private als publieke sector. Uit de resultaten van het hier onderzochte corpus, bestaande uit 34 vacatureteksten, blijkt dat de intenties van diversiteit en inclusie in algemene zin met name expliciet worden verwoord. In dit geval wordt gerefereerd aan het vormgeven van een diversiteitsbeleid dan wel het bevorderen van een inclusieve werkcultuur. Impliciete intenties rondom diversiteit en inclusie in algemene zin worden vooral in een taakgerelateerde context onder woorden gebracht. In huidig onderzoek is ook gekeken naar specifieke dimensies van diversiteit en inclusie. De resultaten tonen aan dat diversiteitsdimensies in de vacatureteksten van publieke organisaties zowel impliciet als expliciet vaker aan de orde komen dan in die van private organisaties. In het verwoorden van de intenties van inclusie blijkt dat in de vacatureteksten van private organisaties de sollicitant vooral bij de organisatie wordt betrokken. De vacatureteksten van publieke organisaties laten zien dat de sollicitant ook in teamverband wordt ingesloten. Bovendien tonen de uitkomsten aan dat diversiteit en inclusie met elkaar verwant zijn en daardoor niet altijd los van elkaar kunnen worden besproken. Huidig onderzoek bespreekt dan ook de complexiteit van de relatie tussen diversiteit en inclusie aan de hand van een paradox: enerzijds stimuleren organisaties de instroom van medewerkers met diverse achtergronden, anderzijds pleiten organisaties voor gelijkheid ongeacht verschillen tussen medewerkers. Het is dus nog maar de vraag of álle medewerkers daadwerkelijk zichzelf mogen zijn in een organisatie die zich met bewuste intenties inzet voor diversiteit en inclusie. 

Niet eerder werd op kwalitatieve wijze in kaart gebracht op welke manier taalgebruik een rol speelt in relatie tot diversiteit en inclusie in vacatureteksten. Eerder onderzoek toont vooral een eenzijdig perspectief op diversiteit en inclusie in enerzijds private organisaties (Avery, 2003; Avery & McKay, 2006; Cox, 1991; Ely & Thomas, 2001; Flory, Leibbrandt, Rott & Stoddard, 2019; Shore et al., 2011) en anderzijds publieke organisaties (Andrews et al., 2005; Ashikali, Erradouani & Groeneveld, 2013; Çelik, 2016, 2018; Groeneveld & Van de Walle, 2010; Siebers, 2017). Zo ligt de nadruk voornamelijk op minderheden en culturele diversiteit. Om een vernieuwende wetenschappelijke blik toe te passen, is gekeken naar meerdere dimensies van diversiteit en inclusie in vacatureteksten van private en publieke organisaties. Dit onderzoek is dan ook een waardevolle aanvulling op voorgaande onderzoeken en biedt nieuwe inzichten en startpunten voor toekomstig onderzoek."

het realisme compleet genegeerd wordt, maar de nadruk ligt op de analyse van het filmbeeld. Dat 
terwijl het medium film eigenlijk bestaat uit twee belangrijke perceptuele componenten: beeld én 
geluid. Auteurs zoals onder andere Michel Chion en Béla Balázs ondersteunen het belang van zowel 
geluidsanalyse als visuele analyse. Mijn onderzoek sluit aan op dit hiaat van de geluidsanalyse.  
  Deze scriptie onderzoekt de relatie tussen het filmisch realisme en de onderbelichte 
geluidsanalyse door antwoord te geven op de vraag: ‘’hoe draagt het filmgeluid in Roma bij aan het 
realisme in de film?’’
  Deze vraag is besproken in relatie tot het filmgeluid van Roma (Alfonso Cuarón, 2018). 
Omdat Roma beïnvloed lijkt door Cuaróns eigen jeugdherinneringen en het Italiaanse neorealisme, is 
het een interessante vraag hoe de invloed van filmisch realisme zich verhoudt tot het filmgeluid. Deze 
film maakt gebruik van opvallend achtergrondgeluid, on en offscreen geluid en diëgetisch geluid. Met 
behulp van Chions analysemethode zijn deze geluidselementen beter gecategoriseerd. Met deze 
geluidsvormen is een shot voor shot analyseprotocol gemaakt, inclusief de uitingen van het filmgeluid 
op het vlak van omgevingsgeluid, off en onscreen geluid en dialoog. Deze analyse gaat hand in hand 
met een neoformalistische analyse van de motivatie van het filmgeluid, dat vooral realistisch is 
gemotiveerd. Vandaar dat de tweede deelvraag de motivatie van het filmgeluid bevat. Het onderzoek 
concludeert met de bevinding dat perceptueel realisme in het filmgeluid van Roma de overhand heeft, 
maar dat er ook in mindere mate sprake is van een illusionistische en sociaal-realistische invloed."

Overall, results showed that the biggest determined facilitators and barriers that came forward for migrant patients were GP related.

The fact that there are some important and strong differences in components might be an opportunity to better understand the needs and preferences of the different generations. The key components that both groups had in common in this research reflect core elements of patient centered care. The need to view the patient as a unique person, understanding patients and their illness in the context of their background and wanting to establish a relationship with the patient, all answer to the facilitators of willingness to communicate and the social component of communication (apathy and knowledge/awareness of patient and relatives).

Het werk van beide auteurs wordt getoetst aan de praktische bezwaren die Frank Ankersmit en Karl Popper hebben tegen speculatieve geschiedfilosofieën. Hun belangrijkste kritiekpunt is dat speculatieve systemen als die van Spengler en Huntington de natuurwetenschappen verkeerd begrepen hebben als sociale dynamica. Dat zorgt er voor dat ze een holistische visie op het abstracte begrip ‘beschaving’ hebben toegepast. Spengler en Huntington hebben de beschaving als fysisch object bestudeerd, zonder hun theorie falsifieerbaar te maken. Hoewel de twee schrijvers uit een verschillende wetenschappelijke traditie en tijd komen, zijn hun werken allebei te definiëren als het resultaat van speculatieve geschiedfilosofie. Voor de geschiedwetenschap heden ten dage is het belangrijk om over speculatieve systemen in discussie te gaan, omdat zulke systemen weer terug lijken te komen, zoals historicus David Christian stelt."
Sound design in UNSTOPPABLE: geluid als houvast in de visuele hectiek van intensified continuity,"['Hak, M.H.J.']","['Hassler-Forest, D.A.']",2020-09-02T18:00:30Z,nl,[],Media en cultuur,"Hedendaagse Hollywoodfilms zijn steeds levendiger en intensiever geworden. Waar in de jaren ’30 
de gemiddelde lengte van een shot (Average Shot Length, ASL) nog op tien seconden lag, ligt deze na 
2000 onder de vier seconden. In extreme gevallen ligt de ASL zelfs onder de twee seconden. De
shots inhoudelijk zijn bovendien dynamischer geworden. Hoe zorgen de filmmakers ervoor dat de 
kijker zich weet te oriënteren in een dergelijke visueel weinig samenhangende weergave van de 
narratieve wereld? Een belangrijke factor is het sound design, dat een steeds belangrijkere rol is 
gaan spelen in het helpen definiëren en interpreteren van wat er visueel gebeurt. Deze scriptie gaat
dieper in op de werking en rol van sound design in hedendaagse films, aan de hand van een neo-
formalistisch geïnspireerde analyse op de dialoog, filmmuziek en geluidseffecten van twee 
sequenties uit de casusfilm UNSTOPPABLE, de laatste film van Tony Scott. De vraag die daarbij centraal 
staat is hoe het sound design van hedendaagse intensified continuity-films als UNSTOPPABLE voor 
ruimtelijke en temporele coherentie zorgt.
Uit de analyse blijkt dat de dialoog in de gekozen sequenties niet alleen de traditionele 
exposition functie heeft, maar ook de taak om de aandacht van de toeschouwer te sturen en 
bovendien bijdraagt aan de emotionele interpretatie van een scène. Belangrijke informatie wordt 
herhaaldelijk verkondigd vanuit meerdere persoonsperspectieven. De continuïteit wordt dus niet 
alleen bewaakt door gerichte informatie te verschaffen, maar ook door die informatie via 
verschillende kanalen te herhalen. Over de muziek wordt geconcludeerd dat deze een auditieve 
tegenpool vormt van het beeld in het opzicht dat de basis eentonig en repetitief is. Deze 
minimalistische shot- en scène-overkoepelende basis geeft de indruk van een coherent geheel. 
Binnen de harmonische en ritmische beperkingen is er echter nog steeds sprake van een 
empathische muzikale opbouw en afwisseling, om belangrijke momenten te benadrukken en om de 
traditionele emotionele functie te vervullen. Tot slot blijkt dat de geluidseffecten weliswaar rijk van 
klank zijn, maar niet zo gedetailleerd de diëgetische wereld representeren (al dan niet metaforisch) 
als sommige auteurs suggereren. Er zijn keuzes gemaakt in wat de toeschouwer wel en niet hoort 
van deze wereld, met de focus op het uitlichten van de handelingen van de personages en het aan 
elkaar binden van de shots. Inhoudelijk zijn de geluiden meestal een metaforische en overdreven 
verklanking van de gebeurtenissen om zo snel mogelijk emotionele en narratieve duidelijkheid te 
scheppen, vergelijkbaar met een auditieve karikatuur."

Teachers’ perspectives on the role of home cultures in Dutch international transition classes (ISK),"['Koidl, K.']","['Baauw, Sergio']",2020-09-02T18:00:29Z,en,"['Home cultures, newcomer students, ISK classes, transculturing']",Interculturele communicatie,"Abstract
Purpose:
 The purpose of this study was to investigate the teachers’ perspective on the use of students’ home cultures in international transition classes within the Dutch secondary education system. The research explored the teaching methods and practices, as well as benefits and obstacles related to transculturing. 
Methodology:
33 teachers of ISK classes (international transition classes) in the Netherlands were surveyed about the use of their students’ home cultures in class. The five dimensions concluded from the survey data were geared towards method content and approaches, obstacles, and benefits. Open-ended questions aimed at teacher’s satisfaction with transculturing in the classroom and additional needs for its implementation.
Results:
The results indicate that all participants use elements and aspects of the home cultures in their classes moderately frequently. The topics of food and festivities were used most often. Additionally, respondents experienced benefits from transculturing. The findings pertaining to obstacles were linked to lack of knowledge and lack of time. Results further indicated that the teachers wished for more implementation of home cultures and overall needed more home-culture related training, information and guidance. 
Conclusion:
Overall, the findings concord with the literature about dealing with interculturality in diverse classrooms. The moderately frequent use of transculturing may be rooted in a rather positive attitude towards the use of home cultures. In addition, the aforementioned frequency of incorporation corroborates with the teachers’ need for more training, information and guidance.

Despite the Great Recession of 2008, the political mistrust between citizens, and the increase in immigration, there was no significant populist radical right force comparable to the European populist radical right parties. Notwithstanding, after the 2019 Spanish general elections, Vox has become the third political force in the Congress of Deputies. Due to its recent political victory, a topic of debate revolves around Vox’s ideology. Through the analysis of Vox’s electoral programs, and the study of its linguist and rhetoric, this paper will establish if Vox is the new representative of the populist radical right in Spain. Although Franco’s dictatorship was established over 30 years, neither extreme nor radical right parties have obtained more than one percent of the vote since 1979. What factors have influenced the decline of the far-right? Moreover, how this decline has affected the development of Vox’s ideology? These questions will be answered throughout the thesis, finally linking the overuse of Francoist’s dogmas by the extreme right forces, and the lack of modernization by the radical right parties, with the downfall of Spanish far-right. Finally, the thesis will establish how this situation has shaped the development of Vox’s identity."

In seeking to contribute to the developing field of queer game studies, this paper coins the term ‘procedural subjectivity,’ referring to the process whereby the mechanical composition of a game invites the player into a subject-position from which the game becomes meaningful. Building on the work of Donna Haraway, Judith Butler, and Sara Ahmed, the ways in which the formal aspects of a game can queer this procedural subjectivity are explored. The computer game The Novelist is then analyzed through this framework, uncovering seemingly contradictory approaches in a liberatory rejection of dominant design philosophies on the one hand, and a metaphorical simulation of the lived experiences of LGBTQ+ people in precarious situations on the other. The author concludes that these conflicting knowledges can simultaneously be true, reflecting on the queer potential in refusing to be defined along congruent axes."

context became more emotionally charged. The study presented here is an attempt to replicate
these findings, using a newer season of Expeditie Robinson. The results turned out largely
similar. While English usage overall had increased, this study shows that the English
insertions that were used, are highly fixed words and similar to those found 15 years ago.
Still, some code-switches were found, providing support for the idea that for some Dutch

This was done by examining the restrictions of song translation and of dubbing, which indicated that the criteria of singability, rhythm, rhyme, naturalness and sense (as well as audiovisual cohesion and lip synchronization in dubbing) all need to be balanced to achieve a singable translation. Based on these criteria a comparative analysis of translated songs from the dubbed film and stage musical of The Little Mermaid was performed. The analysis indicated that the need for audiovisual cohesion in dubbing affected the rendering of sense in comparison to the musical translation, but that the other criteria were similarly dealt with in both translations."
"How Alone is a Lone Terrorist? An Analysis of a Lone Terrorist’s Strategic Choices and Relational Fields from the 2019 Attack in Utrecht, the Netherlands","['Laplante, S.C.']","['Fumerton, Dr. Mario']",2020-09-02T18:00:34Z,en,"['lone terrorism, relational fields, strategic choices']",Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"‘Lone wolf’ or lone terrorism has traditionally been illustrated as an individual operant who does not belong to a terrorist group nor is subject to external influence. However, these defining characteristics have proven to be misleading when it comes to understanding lone terrorism. Recent studies have revealed that a lone terrorist’s social ties with external networks are essential for an individual to sustain both the motive and capability to commit acts of terrorism. This suggests a paradox to the ‘lone wolf’ concept by taking issue with the assumption that a terrorist’s choices and actions exist independently of external influence and meaning. Despite this observation, how a lone terrorist’s social interactions shape their choices and outcomes of an attack continues to represent an under-researched field. 
The persistence of lone terrorism in the Netherlands has stimulated debates regarding its definition and associated counter-terrorism policy-driving assumptions. Therefore, this research investigates the ‘aloneness’ of lone terrorism by examining the strategic choices and outcomes of a lone terrorist attack that occurred on 18 March 2019 in Utrecht, the Netherlands. In doing so, this study serves to contribute knowledge about how a lone terrorist’s social relationships form and inform the interpretations upon which a lone terrorist’s choice of tactics and strategies is premised.
This research adopted the strategic action approach to uncover the meaning of the lone terrorist’s tactics and strategic trade-offs. This knowledge led to the identification of five specific fields of lone terrorist’s social interactions, conceptualized as relational fields, in relation to the attack. Consequently, this paper argues that ‘lone’ terrorism does not necessarily mean ‘alone’. To the contrary, a lone terrorist’s choices and outcomes of an attack are shaped by the meaning and values which are exchanged, formed and normalised through social interaction. This exploratory research offers counter-terrorism analysts a preliminary framework for understanding the social features of lone terrorism and serves as groundwork for a comparative analysis of cases."
De Facto Detention: Examining the impact living in a liminal ‘non-place’ has on female asylum seekers in Ireland’s system of Direct Provision,"['Crosson, D.N.']","['Slooter, Luuk']",2020-09-02T18:00:35Z,en,"['Direct Provision, Women, Asylum Seeker, Liminality, Non-Place']",Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"Years of increasing asylum claims in Western democratic states has been followed by an extraordinary
rise in detention as a means to ‘manage’ migrant populations. In doing so these states have created
‘non-places’, which are physical manifestations of the insecurity migrants contained within them
experience. The creation of these architectures of exclusion has been widely criticised by human rights
groups, and as a result the state’s ability to institutionalise them often pivots on their ability to frame
these policies as temporary, a short-term solution to deal with a crisis. Ireland’s system of ‘Direct
Provision’, a form of ‘de facto’ detention, is an excellent example of this strategy as it too was
introduced as a policy to temporarily control the influx of asylum seekers. However, this system is now
the new normal, as new centres have continued to open since it was first established twenty years
ago.

This research will contribute to the growing body of literature on the impact of detention,
homing in on the experiences of female asylum seekers in ‘Direct Provision’ to do so. I will investigate
the impact of living in liminality, which is the chronic sense of insecurity asylum seekers face. A review
of relevant literature identified certain sites of consequence in which this liminality was most palpable,
these sites related to asylum seekers’ health, ability to parent, and their employment opportunities.
With consideration for these key sites, in-depth qualitative interviews of current female residents in
‘Direct Provision’ were conducted to examine the impact of living in a liminal ‘non-place’. This research
provides an insight into the impact of liminality, but also interprets some of the ways residents actively
resist the imposition of liminality by building resilience from within the system and integrating with
the local community."
Importance of Intersectionality: The Experiences of Women of Color of Ethnic Profiling in the Netherlands,"['Chamman, S.P.']","['Mario Fumerton, Dr.']",2020-09-02T18:00:35Z,en,['intersectionality; women of color; ethnic profiling; institutionalized racism; the Netherlands; Dutch exceptionalism;'],Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"Ethnic profiling is one of the manifestations of institutionalized racism in the Netherlands. It is defined as the practice of being arrested or stopped by security officials based on ethnicity. Moreover, within this practice, it is believed that people from certain ethnic groups are more likely to commit crimes. Public and academic debates regarding ethnic profiling have been focused on the experiences of men. However, if we want to understand the practice of ethnic profiling in a holistic way, we need to incorporate the experiences of women of color.     This thesis aims to capture the experiences of women of color in the Netherlands with ethnic profiling. The aim is not to add to the list of women’s experiences but rather to understand how ethnic profiling looks like while acknowledging how gender and ethnicity, among other identity categories, intersect. To do this, I used intersectionality as my analytical frame. Intersectionality is not only about different identity categories that intersect, but especially about the outcomes of this interaction in power relations, creating inequality.    By doing semi-structured interviews, I have collected a diverse range of experiences with ethnic profiling. This range of experiences shows how women of color are marginalized in the context of ethnic profiling. The women felt that these experiences were influenced by the intersectional stereotypical ideas of black womanhood, the womanhood of Middle Eastern women, and Asian womanhood. So, these experiences did not only feel influenced by the fact that these women are of color, but, moreover, because they are women of color. The experiences of these women cannot be generalized since different ethnicities and other identity categories influence the experiences of women of color differently.    In short, the understanding of ethnic profiling will only be more inclusive and allencompassing if an intersectional way of thinking about these women’s experiences is included."

The dominant discourses on asylum seekers and refugees that are considered ‘acceptable’ and ‘normal’, are actually social constructs. For example, we perceive asylum seekers and refugees as a threat or as victims, and we regard the inflow of asylum seekers and refugees as a crisis. As such, it seems that systems of power allow for the discursive ‘truth’ of 'crisis' to be produced and sustained. Moreover, our perception of the refugee ‘crisis’ is used to legitimise how we treat asylum seekers and refugees. Do we want our current understanding of the inflow of asylum seekers and refugees to govern our (policy) approach? 
	This thesis adopts a Critical Discourse Analytic approach and operationalises Foucault’s ‘regime of truth’ as an analytical frame, to study the interaction between discourse, truth, and power. This research identifies three dominant discourses on asylum seekers, refugees, and the refugee crisis in the Netherlands from 2014 until 2019: the threat/securitisation discourse, humanitarian discourse, and human rights discourse. Powerful media and political apparatuses have status and are sanctioned to produce these dominant discourses, while asylum seekers and refugees are unheard. I argue that the regime of truth in Dutch society suspends asylum seekers and refugees between victimhood and malevolence. The systems of power that produce and sustain this regime of truth are inherently unequal and work to legitimise structural and symbolic violence against asylum seekers and refugees in the Netherlands. This thesis contributes by uncovering power relations and deconstructing established ways of knowing in discourses on the ‘crisis’ of asylum seekers and refugee."

Given the potential of performative installations as catalysers for reflection on curation, this thesis attempts to answer how to create curatorial discourse from, through and toward the artwork. To do so, Constructive Grounded Theory is used to extensively review literature on performance art, installation art, curation, and aesthetics, and afterwards conform a conceptual foundation for both analysis and reflection on performative installations and curating.
Throughout this thesis, the usefulness of speculation as a way of thinking and potentially producing the curatorial is argued and practised. By conceptually speculating on three performative installations, the exhibition is considered as a spatial and temporal medium which fuses different types of relationality, negotiation, adaptation and participation between subjects and objects, who shift in roles throughout the artistic experience, defying rigidity and fostering a fluid understanding of curating. This fluidity is argued to be agonistic, which leads to the realisation that curation has the capacity to function not as a solution but as both presenter and decoder of contemporary issues."
Bleached Emotions: A Post-emotional Analysis on Meme Culture in The 2016 Anti-Taiwan Independence Meme Fight,"['Zhou, X.']","['Glas, R']",2020-09-02T18:00:37Z,en,"['China-Taiwan conflict, the 2016 Anti-Taiwan Independence Meme Fight, post-emotionalism, meme culture, onlince civic participation']",Nieuwe media en digitale cultuur,"In 2016, a massive Anti-Taiwan Independence Meme Fight(the Meme Fight) burst between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, resulting in a tension that still exists today. At the then-moment, over 4000 mainland netizens gathered together voluntarily online and used memes to flood more than 10 pro-Taiwan independence Facebook pages in order to protest for their Anti-Taiwan Independence political value. This thesis combined the perspectives of post-emotionalism, the phatic new media, and studies on meme culture and online civic participation as a theoretical framework to understand the 2016 Anti-Taiwan Independence Meme Fight. To understand the Meme Fight is attached with the essence of understanding it as a practice of online civic participation at a larger scale of China-Taiwan geopolitical context. Within such a context, the author suggests that Internet memes expressed not only the political values but also many underlying emotions during the Meme Fight, while the collision of emotions led to the segementing and polarization of social groups who held different standpoints on whether Taiwan is or should be independent. Moreover, as expressions of emotions, the memes also bleahed the emotions by removing them from the expressions. Eventually, the emotions are actually absent in the Meme Fight."

Een onderzoek naar de theorie en praktijk van de weergave van kaarslicht in Nederlandse nachtstukken","['Paloni, M.']","['Weststeijn, T.']",2020-09-02T18:00:40Z,nl,[],Kunstgeschiedenis,"In dit onderzoek staat de vraag centraal wat de theorie en praktijk was van het schilderen van kaarslicht in nachtstukken van Nederlandse schilders die in Italië geweest zijn en in Utrecht werkzaam waren in de periode 1620-1630. Nederlandse schilders waren innovatief in het vertonen van artificiële lichtbronnen in nachtstukken en onderscheidden zich daarmee van andere schilders uit hun tijd. Tot op heden is er geen diepgaand onderzoek uitgevoerd naar de relatie tussen theorie en praktijk van het weergeven van artificiële lichtbronnen in Nederlandse nachtstukken in de periode 1620-1630.
Om een antwoord te geven op de onderzoeksvraag zijn primaire en secundaire bronnen gebruikt om de theorie van het weergeven van kaarslicht in nachtstukken te achterhalen. De primaire bronnen waren kunsttraktaten van twee Italiaanse auteurs, namelijk Trattato dell'arte della pittura (1584) van Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo en De’ veri precetti della pittura (1586) van Giovanni Battista Armenini. De Italiaanse schrijvers doen algemene uitspraken over het weergeven van licht in de schilderkunst en besteden niet veel aandacht aan de manier waarop artificieel licht in taferelen moet worden weergegeven. De auteurs geven in hun traktaten aan dat kleur altijd moet worden weergegeven met de effecten van het licht. Daarnaast schrijven zij dat een schilder kleuren geleidelijk in elkaar over moet laten lopen zonder duidelijk te maken waar een kleur begint en de andere eindigt, opdat geen harde contrasten op het doek ontstaan.
Vervolgens zijn ook twee Nederlandse kunsttraktaten bestudeerd. Het Schilder-Boeck (1604) van Karel van Mander en Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkunst: anders de zichtbaere werelt (1678) van Samuel van Hoogstraten. De Nederlandse schrijvers besteden in hun traktaten aandacht aan de weergave van kaarslicht en zijn schaduw. Volgens de auteurs moeten harde contrasten op het doek vermeden worden en moet een schilder bewust zijn van de schaduwen die door kaarslicht ontstaan.
Tot slot is onderzoek gedaan naar de praktijk van het schilderen van kaarslicht. Dit is gedaan door een selectie te maken van nachtstukken met artificieel licht van Nederlandse schilders die in Italië geweest zijn en in de periode 1620-1630 in Utrecht actief waren. Deze regio is gekozen, omdat de voornaamste schilders die nachtstukken vervaardigden met artificieel licht, zoals Van Honthorst en Ter Brugghen, uit Utrecht kwamen en na hun verblijf in Italië zijn de schilders naar Utrecht teruggekeerd. Daarom is Utrecht het uitgangspunt voor dit onderzoek. De periode 1620-1630 is gekozen, omdat dit de bloeiperiode is van het nachtstuk met kunstmatig licht in Nederland. Uit dit onderzoek is gebleken dat de theorie en de praktijk van het schilderen van nachtstukken met kaarslicht van elkaar verschillen. De auteurs willen door middel van hun kunsttraktaten de schilderkunst bij de vrije kunsten laten horen. Om het gegeven te rechtvaardigen dat de schilderkunst geen ambacht is, willen de schilders in hun traktaten duidelijk maken dat de schilderkunst gebaseerd is op de wetten van de natuur. In theorie was het navolgen van de wetten van de natuur het hoogste doel, maar deze regels waren niet altijd te rijmen met de compositorische keuzes van de schilders. Het gegeven dat schilders niet vaak de voorschriften van de auteurs navolgen heeft onder andere te maken met de iconografie van de taferelen. Kaarslicht wordt door schilders gebruikt om bepaalde elementen uit de schilderijen extra te belichten en de betekenis van een voorstelling te versterken."

taalattitudes en communicatie binnen de huisartsenpraktijk en bij voorlichting over het coronavirus. 
De groep expats in Nederland, vooral in de Randstad, is erg groot, al kent de term ‘expat’ geen 
eenduidige definitie. Het is van belang dat expats communicatie binnen de zorg en rondom de 
coronacrisis ook kunnen begrijpen.  

Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat de respondenten meer informele dan formele gesprekken in het 
Nederlands voeren. Dit kan komen doordat ze hun eigen Nederlands nog niet als vloeiend inschatten. 
Vooral het spreken blijkt (nog) lastig. Wel wil de grote meerderheid beter Nederlands leren spreken 
en een nog grotere groep vindt het belangrijk om Nederlands te spreken wanneer je in Nederland 
woont. Het Engels wordt het liefst gebruikt als voertaal bij de huisarts, ook al vond minder dan de 
helft van de respondenten dat hun huisarts het Engels vloeiend beheerst. De meerderheid van de 
respondenten met kinderen geeft aan dat hun kinderen het liefst Nederlands praten met de huisarts. 
Het is interessant om te zien dat deze expats hun eigen Nederlands beter inschatten dan de expats 
zonder kinderen. Ook vinden zij het belangrijker om Nederlands te leren wanneer je in Nederland 
woont. Ongeveer de helft van alle respondenten is tevreden over zijn of haar huisarts in Nederland. 

De respondenten maken tijdens de coronacrisis gebruik van andere mediabronnen dan waar 
ze voor de crisis gebruik van maakten. Zo lazen ze minder de (online) krant en keken ze vaker naar de 
Engelse versie van de website van de Rijksoverheid. Ze gaven aan te kunnen begrijpen wat de situatie 
is in Nederland en wat de maatregelen zijn die hierbij horen. Daarnaast vindt de grote meerderheid 
dat er via de Nederlandse overheid redelijk wat informatie in het Engels beschikbaar is en dat de 
overheid dus redelijk rekening houdt met mensen die geen Nederlands spreken. 

In de toekomst moet er meer onderzoek komen naar expats. Allereerst moet de definitie van 
‘expat’ duidelijker worden. Daarnaast kan er onder andere meer onderzoek gedaan worden naar de 
ervaringen van expats in de zorg en de mogelijkheden om meer informatie en gesprekken in het 
Engels aan te bieden. Daarnaast lijken expats met kinderen een betere Nederlandse taalvaardigheid 
te hebben en gebruiken zij het Nederlands ook meer dan expats zonder kinderen. Motivatie en 
gelegenheid zouden hiermee te maken kunnen hebben, maar hier moet in de toekomst meer 
onderzoek naar verricht worden."

De Nederlandse Partij van de Arbeid, waar dit onderzoek zich op concentreert, is wellicht wel het meest schrijnende voorbeeld. De oude machtspartij is nu een kleine fractie in de Tweede Kamer en moet met slechts negen Kamerzetels zes andere partijen voor zich dulden. Als reden voor de electorale neergang van de arbeiderspartijen wordt in de literatuur vaak verwezen naar de vervreemding van deze traditionele achterban. Dit zou het gevolg zijn van een koerswijziging van socialistische partij naar een meer op neoliberale principes geschoeide partij. In deze thesis wordt gekeken naar de koerswijziging die binnen de Partij van de Arbeid heeft geleid tot het afschudden van de oude ideologische veren. Deze thesis is specifiek niet gericht op de vraag óf er binnen de PvdA een neoliberale draai heeft plaatsgevonden. In dit onderzoek zal gekeken worden naar hoe de neoliberale omslag naar voren komt in de woorden van de partijleiders.

Het onderzoek concentreert zich op twee van oudsher belangrijke dossiers binnen de Partij van de Arbeid: Volkshuisvesting en Volksgezondheid. De vraag was dan ook of de neoliberale draai van de PvdA terug te zien was in de onderzochte uitingen van de partij. Dat bleek over het algemeen niet echt het geval te zijn. Tussen de uitspraken van Den Uyl in de jaren zeventig en Wim Kok in de jaren negentig zitten inhoudelijk grote overeenkomsten. De sociale uitgangspunten voeren de boventoon en van neoliberaal taalgebruik is weinig tot geen sprake. Het algehele politieke discours van de partij blijft gedurende de onderzochte periode vrijwel gelijk."

Isabella van Elferen’s A-L-I model of video game musical immersion provides one of the most integrated approaches to analysing sonic cues, though fails to provide a holistic account of different types of involvement with video-game environments. This is particularly problematic when it comes to investigating the open-world genre, whose enormous game locations and non-linear gameplay style substantially affect player agency through the lessening of narrative and ludic restrictions. By combining elements of the A-L-I model with spatial aspects of Gordon Calleja’s ‘player involvement’ model, I propose a means to explore video game interaction through the lens of ‘spatial involvement’. Splitting this concept into the further concepts of spatial semiosis and spatial engagement, I furthermore propose a means to collectively analyse both the contextualisation of space through wider cultural literacies, and moment-by-moment interaction with the spatial apparatus of the game environment. The Assassin’s Creed franchise provides a fruitful case study for the application of these concepts given both its relationship to the open-world genre, and its close association to the expression of real-world history. The combination of these two qualities allow for the participation in ‘historical experiences of space’ through relationships to particular game environments. Throughout this paper, I will investigate the ways in which the Assassin’s Creed games immerse through the sonic expression of space, place, and temporality, using my proposed synthesis of van Elferen and Calleja’s models."

This thesis will solely focus on one economic component that greatly defined the country’s and states’ economic progress, namely labor. It wants to make a qualitative and quantitative contribution by mainly focusing on enacted state labor laws by the Massachusetts and South Carolina legislature, while linking it with primary statistical data of the respective states’ economies. In contrast with other studies, this thesis will make a state-level comparison arguing that the early growing economic chiasm between Massachusetts and South Carolina only exacerbated during the Antebellum period, somewhat explainable by their respective state labor laws."

App’s affordances are shaping our online identity. Affordances are functional and relational aspects which frame, while not determining, the possibilities for agentic action in relation to an object (Hutchby 2001; 5). These affordances determine the possibilities and constraints to play and experiment with our online identity within the social media app. People play and are pushing the boundaries of a social media apps (Van Dijck and Poell 2013, de Lange et al. 2015). This has an impact on our culture. For example, catfishing, having fake profiles online, and buying status. The limits of shaping our online identity are widening with newer online platforms (Rogers 2013; 155), which is why there is a need of methodologies to study this phenomenon. The walkthrough method is most suitable for analysing apps in a structured way focusing on the intended goal and use (Light, Burgess and Duguay 2018). However, the walkthrough method is too generic (Gerrard 2018, Dieter et al. 2019) when trying to investigate the playful behaviour of users with their online identity. Other methods, like an affordance analysis and game analysis, better understand online identity, play and playful identities have been studied in this research. I argue that these existing methods do not fully cover this playful behaviour, and therefore it is necessary to propose a new mixed methods approach. This research discusses the overlapping and integration of the walkthrough method and affordance analysis. This is based on a theoretical framework about online identity and playful behaviour within social media. Three things spring to attention in a new method called the Playful Identity Walkthrough:
(1) The balance between wat is made possible and what is made desirable within the app.
(2) The process and elements that affects users’ online identities during the technical walkthrough.
(3) How a playful environment is created and how playful behaviour is being controlled and managed by the app’s affordances during the technical walkthrough.
These three new focus points resulted in three interventions of the walkthrough method by Light et al. (2018). These interventions are: the addition of the balance element within the analysis of the environment of expected use, the focus on online identity and discarding the logbook during the technical walkthrough, and the addition of the mediator characteristics hidden affordances and game elements during the technical walkthrough. Because of these interventions, the Playful Identity Walkthrough allows us to dive deeper into the phenomena of playful identities. By diving deeper more knowledge is gained about the role app developers and an app’s affordances have in constructing and maintaining playful identities within social media apps."

Dit onderzoek is gedaan naar aanleiding van een stageonderzoek over de spelling van het Engels in het primair onderwijs. In het onderwijs wordt geen instructie gegeven over het Engelse spellingsysteem. Er wordt van de leerlingen verwacht dat ze zich de Engelse spelling zelf eigen maken. Dat kan problematisch zijn, omdat het Engelse spellingsysteem veel minder transparant is dan het Nederlandse spellingsysteem. Om meer zicht te krijgen op de spellingvaardigheden van de leerlingen en gerichte adviezen te kunnen geven aan de onderwijspraktijk wat betreft de Engelse spelling, is onderzoek gedaan onder leerlingen van groep 5 tpo. Daarvoor is een Engels gatendictee afgenomen en zijn met behulp van twee analyses verschillende soorten schrijfwijzen onderzocht. 
Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat zwakke spellers achterlopen op sterke spellers in de ontwikkeling van hun impliciete, zelfverworven kennis van verschillende spellingcategorieën. De zwakke spellers, ongeveer de helft van de leerlingen, worden niet vanzelf spellingvaardig en zullen hier waarschijnlijk expliciete instructie voor nodig hebben. Zwakke spellers gebruiken vooral de fonologische strategie: ze spellen veel op hun gehoor. Sterke spellers gebruiken vaker spellingen die in het Engels voor kunnen komen, maar zijn onvoldoende op de hoogte van de condities waaronder deze spellingen gebruikt mogen worden. De regel- en woordbeeldstrategie worden vaker gebruikt door sterke spellers. Een opvallend resultaat is dat de leerlingen vaak niet weten welke grafemen bij specifiek Engelse fonemen horen, zoals het foneem /θ/, dat wordt geschreven als <th>. Zulke fonemen hoeven geen probleem te vormen als een leerling weet welk grafeem met het foneem correspondeert. Het zou deze leerlingen op weg kunnen helpen als hier expliciete instructie over wordt gegeven. Ook werden dyslectische leerlingen onderzocht.

They experience a so-called organizational developments gap, which arises when the architectural structure of the organization does not keep up the pace with the business growth (Flamholtz, 2016). Among others, these scale-ups will have to redesign their internal communication processes in order to make the fundamental transformation of becoming a formally planned, organized and disciplined organization. One of these many Dutch scale-ups is an IT-consultant called Plat4mation. In three years’ time, the company has grown from 40 employees and a head office in Utrecht, the Netherlands, to almost 190 employees and four additional foreign entities. By means of a mixed method approach, conducting both interviews and sending out an online survey, this study aims to investigate what kind of challenges regarding internal communication a global and multicultural scale-up like Plat4mation currently encounters in the transitional phase of becoming a professional organization. The present study specifically focuses on the internal communication flows by means of the Four Flows approach (McPhee & Iverson, 2009; McPhee & Zaug, 2000). A total of 82 employees at Plat4mation completed an online satisfaction survey that measures the internal communication flows. In addition, two managing partners were asked to clarify the need for internal communication expertise. Ultimately, Plat4mation’s challenges turned out to correspond to Flamholtz’s (2016) growing pains: employees do not know what their colleagues are doing due to a lack of activity coordination; and there is a lack of vision among employees as to which direction the company is heading in the long term because of insufficiently developed self-structured internal communication flows."

 By addressing each author’s work in the isolation of a dedicated chapter, the primary aim of this thesis is to examine how each respond to the referendum result, its subsequent years of fallout, and the fractures it uncovered in Britain’s national identity. In order to carry out this investigation, this thesis considers each novel through the lens of two distinct literary tropes: allegory and humour. This thesis shall expand on Christian Gutleben’s term ‘bleak humour’ in order to comprehend and analyse the particular vein of comedy that runs through these texts when addressing the atmosphere and culture that surrounds these novels’ discussion of Brexit. Moreover, this thesis shall present an understanding of the modern allegory which provides the grounding for an investigation into the relationship that each text engenders with its reader in an attempt to draw a response from them to Brexit.

Cyberpunk-genre stories, with their highly detailed, highly critical and exclusively dystopian visions of the future, can serve to sobering and informative tool for technological imaginaries, helping us to envision what moral and ethical problems future technological developments have in store for us so that we can pre-emptively start formulating answers to those problems. To illustrate an example of how cyberpunk can influence technological imaginaries in a meaningfully informative and possibly educational way, two quintessential cyberpunk-genre videogames were analyzed for key themes in their narratives, after which these disseminated themes were formulated into the technological imaginaries the games propose. The result is that cyberpunk-genre stories in particular offer a compelling counter-balance to utopian technological imaginaries, introducing a degree of skepticism and critique into our technological imaginaries related to human augmentation technologies in particular."

The Shi’ites - being historically marginalised - became the easy target for such sort of political coercion. My thesis makes a historical overview focusing on the Shi’a experience in Lebanon, while at the same time I use Foucault’s theory of governmentality and Gramsci’s concept of cultural hegemony in order to provide a better understanding of the ways in which both a foreign power and the Zu’ama have successfully created and maintained their power. I argue that it is exactly Lebanon’s sectarian system which has continuously proven self-destructive due to the historical and political tendency of “otherising”, as well as the country’s weak government and porous state which provided perfect soil for a number of proxy-wars within the Middle East. The main theme of this paper is Hezbollah - although almost any other political party can equally provide a great study, Iran’s influence on it provides a very complex case study of external and internal power impacts. Lebanon’s sectarian government continues to be a destructive political force in Lebanon, albeit being a place of great cultural and religious diversity. My historical and theoretical study of the ways in which the Shi’ites were subjugated adds to existing literature by using two theoretical frameworks, as well as considering very recent events."

This thesis focuses on how the criminal organization ‘Comando Vermelho’ in Rio de Janeiro faced the crisis, implementing a new array of service provision practices to meet the needs of the residents, and how its ‘crisis management’ plan impacted the overall relationship between the criminal group, the state and the citizens of the favelas.
Through applying concepts of hybrid and criminal governance literature, this thesis finds that the relationship dynamics did not change dramatically, as criminal orders existed and were operating effectively long before Covid-19 pandemic reached Brazil. The crisis re-enacted old dynamics, providing however a wider array of practices criminal orders can exploit to grow their legitimacy at the expense of state legitimacy. Criminal orders did so through implement clear
security instructions to protect citizens from the virus and promptly providing health services. This
is likely to erode state legitimacy quicker than if no crisis was present as citizens needs are intensified.
Ultimately, this thesis is in accordance with Leeds (1996) in that it finds that are state’s structural shortcomings that leave open possibilities for criminal groups such as Comando Vermelho to implement effective governance systems and crisis management plans in the neglected areas of the city."

In addition, this thesis is concerned with the role that  framing and reframing can play in the construction of a nation’s collective memory and national identity. 
	The case study through which this research of framing and reframing is conducted is the Memento Park. The Memento Park is a statue park which is situated just outside Budapest, which houses forty-one monuments which used to be located throughout Budapest during the communist era. The reason these monuments ended up at the Memento Park is that after the fall of the communist regime in Hungary in 1989, the people and the municipality of Budapest determined that these reminders of the communist era could no longer remain in the public sphere of Budapest. In this thesis, I argue that the relocation of these monuments to the Memento Park has both framed and reframed them in such a manner that the meaning they convey regarding communist ideology has changed, and that the park thereby plays a role in both the construction of a Hungarian collective memory of the communist era, and the construction of a post-communist identity.
	The most important concept that I use for this analysis is framing, which simultaneously serves as my primary methodology, as I am analysing the different frames that have been applied to the monuments in the Memento Park by moving them there. In addition to framing, I use numerous texts that discuss monumentality, collective memory of the communist era in Central and Eastern Europe, the relation between communist heritage and tourism and the relation between arts and society."

By employing the Foucauldian biopolitical lens, I question the transformation of the prenatal screening/diagnosis from a tool to monitor high risk pregnancies to a modern eugenics technology used to separate foetuses into worth living - abled bodies, and not worth living - disabled bodies. Reading the prenatal apparatus as an instance of biopolitics, I show how the medical gaze apprehends both the pregnant body and the foetus as its objects of knowledge, and regulates them through public health practices and policies. In this view, I weave different streams of feminist and disabilities theories and their engagement with the Foucauldian “truth”. On one hand, I unpack the notion of risk employed by the modern governmentality to normalise disability screening, and on the other hand, I build on the critiques on sex selection abortion and selective abortion in case of  disability. Through the analysis of a Dutch case study of the prenatal testing, I find the trend of home birth to be not only related to the safety and non-medicalisation of the birth, but also influenced by the cost-effectiveness of home-birth option compared to hospital and birth-centre options. The high perinatal mortality in The Netherlands forces the implementation of a nationwide prenatal testing praxis designed to manage the risk for foetal disabilities and to facilitate that all women can test for disabilities regardless the risk of their pregnancy. The easiness of the Non-Invasive Prenatal Test (NIPT) and the increase demand for carrier (genetic) screening raise ethical implication, such as the normalisation and trivialisation of selective abortion due to disabilities and the risk of extending the scope of the test for abnormalities, endangering our collective view on “normal” human embodiment."

Unfortunately, the majority of attempts by bisexuality and queer theorists to use bisexuality as an epistemological perspective have failed to acknowledge bisexuality as an identity/subject position. This study aims to provide an approach to bisexuality that simultaneously acknowledges the lived reality of bisexual-identifying individuals while recognising the potential of bisexuality as a hypothetical tool of analysis in queer theorising. Building on the argument that bisexuality is only truly useful to queer theory if both aspects of the orientation are acknowledged, this thesis asks: how does understanding bisexuality as a “liminal space”, encompassing both bisexuality as an identity/subject position and bisexuality as an epistemological perspective, enhance the contribution of bisexuality to queer theory? Typically used in anthropology, “liminal space” describes the gap that exists “betwixt and between” socially constructed categories.

Based on the fact that bisexual identity/subjectivity has largely been overlooked within sexuality scholarship in favour of reducing bisexuality to a hypothetical, this thesis worked predominantly with semi-structured interviews in effort to maximise the voices of bisexual- identifying individuals. Using a combination of thematic analysis and discourse analysis, the research demonstrated how bisexuality and bisexual-identifying individuals are consistently positioned between and outside of the heterosexual/homosexual binary, skirting the border of both without fully belonging to either. For this reason, this research proposes that bisexuality be understood as a liminal space. Further research is needed to fully explore the potential of this conceptualisation, and to explore the influence of intersecting identity categories in shaping bisexual subjectivity. Largely still ignored in both sexuality scholarship and in LGBTQ+ communities and activism, sexuality scholars, particularly queer theorists, would greatly benefit from sustained engagement with bisexuality – and vice versa, as to do so would finally grant bisexuality and the bisexual community the attention it deserves."

Using Jacque Rancière’s work on dissensus and Judith Butler’s work on the performativity of protest as foundation, this paper will map out some of the creative strategies used by the campaign in order to disrupt the established notion of Ireland as an abortion-free country. These examples are described and contextualized within theories on the space of appearance, politics of aesthetics, agonistics, dispossession, and performativity. Through a combination of discourse, visual, and cultural analysis I will demonstrate the disruptive nature of these aesthetics. These examples are provided along three main themes – embodied resistance, agonism between different sides of the campaign, and emotive images. I will explore how embodied protests such as Strike4Repeal and the Artists’ Campaign to Repeal the Eighth Amendment succeeded in breaking open the space of appearance and revealing the unseen abortion-seeking women. Using Chantal Mouffe’s work on agonistics, I will discuss the clash of different sides of the debate and explore how this clash revealed itself through aesthetics. I will demonstrate how the pro-choice side subverted aesthetics created by the pro-life side for their own campaign. Finally, I will illustrate how the image of a migrant woman, Savita Halappanavar, was used by the campaign to shift the focus of the debate to the bodies threatened by the Eighth Amendment and reveal what was unseen within the established social order – the violence associated with the Eighth Amendment."

By applying a constructivist approach to this problem, this thesis challenges the dominant neorealist discourse on nuclear deterrence. By researching the nuclear command-and-control structure of India and Pakistan, instead of nuclear doctrine, this thesis has produced the following conclusions. Pakistan’s nuclear posture continues to inhibit India’s ability to compel Pakistan, raising the risk of nuclear escalation. India and Pakistan are horizontally developing their nuclear forces, raising the cost of nuclear escalation. India and Pakistan’s nuclear command-and control measures are respectively trending more towards positive control, or are already positive control-oriented, increasing the risk of unwanted nuclear use. India and Pakistan are vertically developing their nuclear forces as well, expanding their capabilities to include tactical nuclear weapons and sea-based missiles, thus lowering the threshold for nuclear use. This thesis finds that the development of India and Pakistan’s nuclear posture has opened up new avenues for a crisis to escalate to the nuclear level, and increased the number of nuclear missiles that would be involved."

The mental lexicon is viewed as a network. In bilinguals, these networks can be activated at the same time and, according to the BIA+ model, are connected. Words that have similar orthographic or semantic representations in both languages, such as interlingual homographs and cognates, affect the recognition speed of a bilingual speaker. L2 proficiency can affect the recognition of these words. Most studies on bilingual word recognition use the Lexical Decision Task as a method. Due to the limitations of this method, especially for bilinguals, a new method is used to test which word type, English words, Dutch words, or English-Dutch cognates, participants will recognise most frequently. This method, developed by Dr. Zuckerman, uses a Word-Search Puzzle to study word recognition. This study also investigated the effect of proficiency on the recognition of these words. 50 Dutch-English bilinguals with varying levels of English proficiency were tested, and it was found that both Dutch words and cognates were recognised more frequently than English words. However, English proficiency did not influence the recognition of these words."

Some of the arguments made by several music educators and musicians of that time were also one of the targets of criticism. Due to Xiao Youmei’s view that ""Chinese music lags behind Western music by a thousand years,"" as well as his role as the founder of China's first professional music academy, his name has repeatedly appeared in the post-colonial criticism of Chinese music education by Chinese scholars. Those scholars believe that the implantation of the western music education system results in the adherent character of the music education and value standards in some developing countries and makes them affiliate to the West in the concept and form of music development, propelling the dissemination of ""Western Music-centrism Theory"" in the field of Chinese music education. The western music theory is currently the authoritative mainstream in Chinese music education and culture, impeding the development and spread of traditional Chinese music theory. That also leads to the lack of voice of traditional Chinese music. However, it is unfair to blame a historical figure more than 100 years ago for the over-westernization of Chinese music education, even though he directly applied the western music education system to China. This essay discusses some of Xiao Youmei’s musical thoughts and the criticisms some scholars have made about him based on related historical, political, and humanistic backgrounds, and re-evaluates his contribution and blunder from the perspective of post-colonialism."

Understanding the Battle for AI in Warfare through the Practices of Assemblage: A Case Study of Project Maven,"['Wilson, N.A.']","['Gould, L.M.']",2020-09-02T18:01:05Z,en,['Artificial Intelligence; Project Maven; Lethal Autonomous Weapons; Killer Robots; Remote Warfare; Assemblage'],Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely-heralded as a revolutionary technology across a range of domains, including defence. In this sphere, its potential for automating low-cost and low-risk forms of warfighting known as “remote warfare” has given rise to fears of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS). While the use of LAWS has been subject to intense speculation, far less attention has been paid to their development. Notably, cutting-edge AI innovation is not to be found in government-funded research labs or traditional defence contractors, but consumer technology companies. Because of this, unique controversies have arisen over its development. In the case of Project Maven, a US Department of Defense initiative seeking to leverage AI for automating drone footage analysis, employee protests eventually forced one of its contractors, Google, to end their involvement. Using Project Maven as a case study, this research therefore seeks to understand the development of an emerging Military-Technological Complex developing these technologies and an oppositional Civil Society Coalition seeking to regulate them.
Based on documentary analysis of key texts and five semi-structured expert interviews, this thesis uses an assemblage approach to examine the discourses surrounding Project Maven, the interplay of power between its elements, and their resulting configurations. It finds a tension between the compulsory powers of the Military-Technological Complex, exercised through structural, material relations, and the productive powers of Civil Society, exercised through the production and sanctioning of knowledge. It concludes that the development of consumer technologies for warfare and the associated emergence of a Military-Technological Complex reflects a broader unravelling of conventional ties between war, space and time."

Codificatie is een onderdeel in het standaardiseringsproces van een taal, waarin de taal in een bepaalde vorm wordt vastgelegd in bijvoorbeeld woordenboeken en grammatica’s. Uit eerder onderzoek voor het Meertens Instituut is een inventarisatie van codificatiemateriaal gekomen voor Limburgse, Nedersaksische en Brabantse dialecten. Ook zijn de motivaties behoren bij deze werken geanalyseerd. In het huidige onderzoek zijn deze gegevens en de motivaties met elkaar vergeleken, de chronologische ontwikkelingen bekeken en het verband met standaardisering en ontwikkelingen rondom deze dialecten onderzocht. Uit deze analyse blijkt dat Nederlandse dialecten sinds de 16e eeuw al worden vastgelegd in codificatiemateriaal. Ook is er een duidelijke stijging te zien in de periode die de dialectrenaissance wordt genoemd, vanaf ongeveer de jaren ’80 van de vorige eeuw. Wanneer de motivaties worden vergelijken blijkt dat vooral het behoud, vastleggen en stimuleren van (wetenschappelijke) kennis en waardering voor dialecten van belang zijn. Daarnaast zijn sommige motivaties uniek voor bepaalde dialectregio’s, zoals het onderscheid tussen Standaardnederlands en een lokaal dialect in Limburg. Codificering geeft blijk van belangstelling voor een dialect, maar kan ook de belangstelling en waardering op zijn beurt verhogen. Dit leidt niet tot het volledig doorlopen van het standaardiseringsproces, maar kan wel andere positieve gevolgen hebben en zorgt ervoor dat dialecten in bepaalde vormen bewaard blijven."

Currently there is a rise in the awareness of environmental security risks caused by climate change, however, notions and pursuits of unlimited economic growth have been institutionalized in politics and society. Human activity during the second half of the century came to known Great Acceleration, its impacts have affected many of the Earth's ecosystems and geology. Efforts to protect the environment were developed by the state during the Clinton administration. However, the efforts were maintained through realist strategies that did not directly account for the sources causing environmental security risks, such as the deregulation of the markets and the increase in fossil fuel production. This discourse analysis case study follows a constructivist approach to analyze the relationship between the fossil fuel industry and environmental security. The case study examines perspectives adopted by the U.S government, Barack Obama, and the Paris Agreement that refrain from explicitly challenging the fossil fuel industry. It argues that despite the growing global environmental security risks the efforts to adopt sustainable development approaches have been neglected over pursuits of economic growth and realist national security agendas."

The Arctic was imagined as a plain place, where the superpowers of the Cold War had their standoff with U-Boats and secret nuclear facilities. Gorbachev’s speech in Murmansk turned this image into something that can be understood through one word: cooperation. The Arctic became a region in which nation-states worked together to create international organizations, like the Arctic Council, to face common issues such as environmental protection and sustainable development. However, International Relations has not paid much attention to images and their impact in the international sphere. In the case of the Arctic, images had never been interpreted as a part of the international achievement contributing to the essence of what the region is today. Images have agency and are affecting the processes that shape the Arctic. The theory of Imagency explains how images become actors, as region-builders that take part in the discourse and shape the social world. Nation-states orient themselves at these images and have to interact with them to shape their own national identity in the international sphere. One region that displays this process is the Arctic and the Arctic nation-states. From 1989 to 2019, the image of Arctic cooperation heavily influenced the International Relations of the Arctic regarding that nation-states engaged with it. Nation-states took Arctic cooperation as a part of their own identity until the mid-2000, when this exact image was contested by the same states."
The English God of Water: Memory of a colonial engineer in Andhra Pradesh,"['Huber, P.']","['Mieroop, K.

Over 3,000 statues of the engineer, whose irrigation works are credited with having ended famine and bringing prosperity to the area, dot the countryside. In this paper I look at the memory of Cotton by applying Pierre Nora’s concept of the lieux de mémoire and Ann Rigney’s idea of the convergence of lieux de mémoire to the statues. The statues have become a symbol of the Kamma caste and through this they have attained political significance as well. Cotton is constantly lauded for his efforts to save coastal Andhra and he functions as an ideal for current generations as well. This continuing reverence of Cotton has turned him into an important symbol of the farmers who profit most from his works, the members of the Kamma caste. While strange at first sight, Cotton’s statues are part of a wider trend in Indian politics. Religious and political groups publicly display their power by erecting statues. The figures represented by the statues usually belong to the group whose influence they are supposed to make visible. However, the colonial context in which Cotton operated is not an important part of this memory. This has allowed him to almost become a local figure, he has become suitable as a representative of the caste and is also seen as such by others.  It is somewhat ironic that such a staunch imperialist as Cotton would be revered in a postcolonial nation, however not only does his imperialism not play a role in popular remembrance, it is also not thematised in academic works which discuss Cotton’s work."
European Counterterrorism Culture: The European response to the jihadist threat and the formulation of the sector's security culture,"['Fusiek, D.A.']","['Gerits, Dr. Frank']",2020-09-02T18:01:03Z,en,"['Security culture, European counterterrorism, european counterterrorism culture']",International Relations in Historical Perspective,"The main goal of this thesis is to investigate the reasons that made European response 
to jihadist terrorism after 2015 more successful than previous experiences with a similar 
threat. The research assumes that the roots of this development could be identified in 
the emergence of a European counterterrorism culture that the thesis introduces to 
describe: the specific patterns of behavior; the expression of norms and standards; and 
set of power relations determining EU’s approach to terrorism. The paper contributes 
to the academic debate by taking a cultural approach to the study of the evolution of 
European counterterrorism. To validate this hypothesis and to answer the research 
question, the thesis analyses the development of this sector in two decades: the
development of European counterterrorism in the aftermath of 9/11 and the European 
response to the jihadist threat after 2015. While the former aims to show the formulation 
of the elements of European counterterrorism culture, the latter has the purpose of 
further displaying the continuance of the same features in the EU’s response after 2015. 
The thesis concludes that: (a) there is a security culture present in the sector through 
the identification of the specific patterns of behavior, norms, standards and power 
relations; (b) the security culture contributed positively to the formulation of the 
European response after 2015."

Ook de liberale joodse gemeenschap heeft een ritueel om de relatie tussen twee same-sex seksuelen te zegenen, ook al is die niet gelijk aan het traditionele joodse huwelijk. Binnen de orthodoxie is niet zo’n ritueel te vinden, ondanks dat het zwaartepunt van de religieuze joden qua leden bij de orthodoxie ligt."

De graaf van den Bergh kon zich namelijk tot de aanzienlijkste adel van Gelre rekenen en had een belangrijke positie in het hertogdom. Bergh lag bovendien op een strategische plaats doordat het grensde aan het hertogdom Kleef, dat het grootste deel van de oorlog tegen Gelre vocht. De graaf was daardoor direct bij de oorlogssituatie betrokken. De situatie was bovendien diplomatiek uitdagend omdat de graaf van den Bergh zowel verplichtingen had aan Gelre als aan Habsburg. Een belangrijk element in dit onderzoek is daarom de houding die de graaf jegens de vorst aannam, teneinde zich in de complexe situatie staande te kunnen houden, en hoe die houding in de loop der tijd veranderde."

The Dutch Health Insurance Act and the Jordy Zwarts Case - Is it morally justifible for governments to require that citizens buy health insurance from private companies?,"['Suelmann, N.']","['Nyholm, S.']",2020-09-03T18:00:12Z,en,[],Applied Ethics,"This thesis delves into a lawsuit regarding the Dutch basic health insurance. In the lawsuit, it is argued that since the compulsory basic health insurance in the Netherlands is regulated by private health insurance companies, the coercive character is impermissible. This thesis will analyze this argument. First, it will examine the moral permissibility of a private health insurance company, by delving into the debate on the commodification of healthcare. Then, it will question whether the coercion of the insurance is morally permissible, by looking at several conceptions of freedom and how they apply to this argument. 

It concludes that the norms used in the market sphere of health insurance are not characteristic of a typical market, as described by Elizabeth Anderson. For this reason, the private health insurance company is just as morally permissible, if not more, than a public one. Furthermore, it shows that the arguments in the court case are based around a libertarian conception of freedom. This account on freedom argues for a free choice, but does not realize that one is not free if one does not have access to all the basic liberties. In order to be free, then, this thesis advocates for an relational egalitarian account where health insurance is seen as a basic liberty. This way, a person is only free if she has both the choice to use it, and the duty to provide it for others. This can only be done in a mandatory form."

Voor Rijkswaterstaat betekent dit dat circulaire principes nu al een integraal onderdeel moeten worden van het ontwerpproces waar IPM-rolhouders zich mee bezig houden (Dijcker, 2018). Het doel van dit onderzoek is het achterhalen van de betekenis die IPM-rolhouders geven aan circulair werken en de vormen van kennisdeling die zij interpreteren als ondersteunend in de transitie naar circulaire werkprocessen. De volgende hoofdvraag staat daarom centraal in dit onderzoek: ""Welke betekenis geven IPM-rolhouders binnen Rijkswaterstaat aan circulair werken en welke vormen van kennisdeling worden door hen als ondersteunend ervaren in de overgang naar circulaire werkprocessen?""
Dit vraagstuk is door middel van een kwalitatieve casestudie binnen Rijkswaterstaat onderzocht. Hierbij is een interpretatieve benadering gehanteerd. Er zijn zestien interviews afgenomen bij IPM-rolhouders.
Concluderend kan gesteld worden dat IPM-rolhouders binnen Rijkswaterstaat circulair werken belangrijk vinden. De grootste reden hiervoor is dat door circulair te werken milieu-impact gereduceerd kan worden. Toch spelen op dit moment economische overwegingen een grote rol in het ontwerpproces. Opvallend is dat respondenten circulariteit benaderen vanuit verschillende paradigma’s. In het ene paradigma, een meer economische worldview, wordt circulariteit beschouwd als een extra aspect om rekening mee te houden, maar moet het niet ten koste gaan van zaken die meer prioriteit krijgen, zoals veiligheid, tijd en geld. Vanuit het andere paradigma, wat meer vanuit holistische principes is ingestoken, is circulariteit een totaal ander wereldbeeld. Het is allesomvattend en vergt een nieuwe manier van kijken naar objecten en materiaal. Verder blijkt uit dit onderzoek dat circulariteit op dit moment als lastig en moeilijk uitvoerbaar wordt gezien. Respondenten ervaren een gebrek aan handvatten en de huidige werkprocessen lijken niet in lijn te zijn met de circulaire denkwijze. Respondenten zijn met name in interactie met anderen, tijdens gesprekken en workshops aan nuttige kennis gekomen over circulair werken. Sociaal leren heeft bij respondenten de voorkeur: het in interactie delen van kennis en ervaring. 
Het is goed om in gesprek tot een gezamenlijke betekenis te komen. Huidige werkprocessen zullen met een kritische blik bekeken moeten worden om na te gaan of deze nog wel passen bij een circulaire werken denkwijze. Ten slotte dient sociaal leren en kennisdeling meer gefaciliteerd en gestimuleerd te worden."

I argue that Miquela is not just a form of female representation, but also a simulation whose goal is to perpetuate the objectification and commodification of the female body through microcelebrity practice. Additionally, I also argue that in this process of simulating Miquela, her producers are exhibiting symptoms of the cyborg body by controlling the female body and constructing femininity, and normalizing and industrializing this process. I support my arguments by using James Paul Gee’s applied discourse analysis and his Tools of Inquiry for Building Tasks to analyze Miquela’s discourse about her brand, her coming out story, and her appearance and her purpose in the Zang Zach Show interview in December 2019."
Generational Differences in Employer Preferences: Using the Employer Attractiveness Scale in The Netherlands,"['Krommendijk, K.']","['Altink, W.', 'Jansen, W.']",2020-09-04T18:00:11Z,en,"['Baby Boomers, Generation Y, Generation X, Employer Attractiveness, employer preferences']","Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","This study aimed to investigate whether different generational groups, in specific Millennials (Generation Y), differ from their preceding generations (Baby Boomers and Generation X) in their employer preferences and whether this could be investigated by a translated, Dutch version of the Employer Attractiveness Scale (EmpAt) (Berthon, Ewing, & Hah, 2005). This EmpAt consists of five values: Interest, Social, Economic, Development, and Application Value. There seems to be no consensus in literature about whether there are differences between generations and their employer preferences. To be able to fill the gap of a relatively large group of retiring employees, for employers, it is important to know how to attract scarce and younger employees. This study employed a cross-sectional and questionnaire survey design. Participants were recruited using convenience sampling and were all employees of a Dutch Regional Community College. In total, there were 177 participants (120 women, 57 men, Mage = 47.2 years, age range: 24 – 66 years). The participants were classified in three groups: Baby Boomers (n = 55), Generation X (n = 72), and Generation Y (n = 50). These participants were asked to fill in the Dutch EmpAt, measured on a five-point Likert scale, ranging 1 (very unimportant) to 5 (very important). The original five factors of the EmpAt did not similarly arise in the Dutch EmpAt. Furthermore, only Development Value was significantly more important for Generation Y than for Baby Boomers. The effect of Age on Economic Value was positively moderated by Social, Development, and Application Value and the effect of Age on Interest Value was positively moderated by Development Value. These findings add to the growing body of literature that contradicts current popular literature suggesting generational differences with regard to employer preferences exist. This different perspective might shed light on an ongoing discussion regarding generational differences between empirical research and a more theoretical point of view."

Data for this cross-sectional study (N = 104) was obtained by means of an online questionnaire distributed via various social media platforms. Results of the mediation analyses indicate that developmental feedback can be seen as a weak antecedent of OCB (p = .10). Moreover, findings show that the relationship between developmental feedback and OCB is not partially mediated by AOC. Furthermore, results display that task interdependence can be also considered as a weak antecedent of OCB (p = .07). Yet, this effect vanishes in favor of a full-mediation based on AOC.

Het fenomeen ‘sharenting’ (het overmatig delen van informatie over je kinderen via sociale media) in de vorm van ouders die ‘vloggen’ (video bloggen) wordt in dit onderzoek getoetst aan de intuïtie dat het moreel problematisch is. Aan de hand van een aantal concepten dat verband houdt hiermee, is onderzocht op welke manier sharenting in strijd is met het de ontwikkeling een autonoom zelfbeeld bij kinderen. Aan de hand van theorieën van Joseph Kupfer en Robert Gerstein beargumenteer ik dat privacy een vereiste is voor het opbouwen van intieme relaties. We definiëren onszelf aan de hand van een variëteit aan relaties die we met anderen aangaan. Het autonome zelfbeeld dat kinderen hiermee ontwikkelen wordt door sharenting in gevaar gebracht omdat intimiteit en openbaarheid niet meer duidelijk van elkaar gescheiden wordt. Daarnaast focus ik me op een ander aspect van de ontwikkeling van een autonoom zelfbeeld, namelijk door te kijken naar de rol van een narratieve identiteit. Om een duidelijk concept te krijgen van het ‘zelf’, is het belangrijk om een eigen levensverhaal als narratief te construeren. De theorieën van Paul Ricoeur, Marya Schechtman en Alasdair Macintyre staan centraal in de bespreking van narratieve identiteit. Vloggen is een nieuwe manier om je narratieve identiteit tot uitdrukking te brengen. Ouders die een overmatige hoeveelheid informatie delen wat hun kinderen betreft, vertellen hiermee eigenlijk al een levensverhaal voordat het kind dit zelf kan doen. Als de morele waarde van de ontwikkeling van een autonoom zelfbeeld, zoals Kupfer dat doet, wordt aangenomen, dan concludeer ik op basis van de ondervindingen, dat vloggen moreel problematisch is voor de ontwikkeling van kinderen."

This can cause rational agents to perform sub-optimally at group level. The problem seems to stem from a disbalance in on one hand providing new information for the group (independent behavior), and other the other hand making use of this publicly available information (dependent behavior). Carried out in extremes, the fi?rst type of behavior would ignore potentially useful information, while the latter would lead to possibly incorrect herding-behavior. 
In this thesis, I investigate how in-group agents should ideally balance out the use of publicly accessible information, so that they can maximize their result as a group. A solution is provided for a speci?c example of sequential decision making, known as the urn problem. The main ?finding is that a perfect balance indeed exists, and that the information provided by early actors contributes the most to the optimal group result."

The undertaken discovery on the Sovexport Collection brings its content to the scholarly attention by revealing a number of paradoxes in the representation of the Soviet utopia. Pursuing an extensive empirical and theoretical study of the Sovexport films with the aim to throw light at their semi-fictional features, my methodology evolves within the broader framework of the semio-pragmatic approach to documentaries, which demonstrates when films can be considered as non-fiction. After having searched for the authentication tools used by filmmakers to produce the documentaries’ meaning, I bring to the fore the visions of space, nature, and technology seen as part of the utopian Communist grand narrative documented in the Sovexport films. As a result, I delineate two types of nostalgia nurtured by the dreamworlds of the examined documentaries. The first prevails in today’s Russia where nostalgia is of a reflective kind, and filmmakers emphasize that mostly individuals alien to the Soviet era and its realities are fascinated by the Communist utopia.  In turn, non-fictional films created in the West display an evoked enchantment with the Soviet utopian model, which goes beyond the mere symbols of “Sovietness”. The unveiled evidence shows that Soviet ideology is depicted as holding transformative power for the future. This can be further observed when comparing the Sovexport films with contemporary documentaries produced in the West, as the latter follow a similar strategy of blurring fiction and reality. Filling a gap in the study of Soviet cinema, the thesis thus provides a new impetus for making, viewing, and analyzing documentary films in accord with history and its complexities."

Within poststructuralism, this primacy emerges out of a heteronormative framework of legitimation, in which certain forms of kinship become legible while others do not (Butler 2004). In a socialist feminist account, the nuclear family provides a specific form of organizing reproductive labor (Bhattacharya 2017b). Accordingly, it plays a role in reproducing labor power, as well as the systemic conditions of capitalism. The integrated approach to capitalism and heteronormativity developed here, presents the family as an institution constituted through a specific form of performative, reproductive, skilled labor within the normative regulation of the state (Floyd 2009; R. Ferguson 2004). The emergent institution, however, internalizes a number of contradictions. On the one hand, it is structured by public forms of normativity and on the other, it plays a role in upholding them. These contradictions are further embedded within the systemic contradictions in capitalism (Jaeggi 2018; Fraser 2017). This has a paradoxical result: While the family manifests these crisis tendencies, it also holds potential to resolve them that emerge out of the contradictions of reproductive labor. In line with this, the contradictions of capitalism and the family can structure a post-capitalist imaginary through the lens of more adequately organizing social reproduction. Finally, these contradictions take place in an environment structured by the state. To account for this, the final chapter presents a prefigurative image of reorganized social reproduction. The Swiss institution of civil service, or in German Zivildienst, works to illustrate this (Bundesamt für Zivildienst ZIVI 2018). Specifically, it is discussed by virtue of its ability to externalize the contradictions that the family has internalized."

Vervolgens beantwoordde de respondent vragen om de constructen: organisationele reputatie, toegeschreven crisisverantwoordelijkheid en waargenomen Conversational Human Voice (CHV) te meten. Er is een hoofdeffect van excuses voor de oorzaken gevonden in effect op de reputatie.

However, little is known about the developmental language trajectories of children with 22q11DS. The aim of the current study is to investigate whether the language proficiency of pre-schoolers with 22q11DS develops differently compared to TD children by administering and analysing the standardized language measures (comprising different language domains) of children with 22q11DS aged 3;0-6;6 years old on two time points (six months apart). The children’s scores were compared with a matched TD group at the first test moment, and with norm scores at both test moments. The results showed that children with 22q11DS have an overall lower language proficiency than their peers. Children with 22q11DS showed improvement for both receptive and expressive vocabulary and for sentence comprehension between T1 and T2. Furthermore, age corrected norm scores did not differ between T1 and T2, indicating that children with 22q11DS develop at a comparable rate as their TD peers on all subdomains. Exploratory analyses suggest that children with 22q11DS have more difficulty keeping up with the developmental pace of the norm group for expressive, than for receptive language skills. These findings indicate that developmental language trajectory is language domain dependent in this population. It is recommended to start speech-language therapy at a young age for children with 22q11DS and to monitor their language development throughout childhood."

by examining how the laws interacted with society, and by exploring the interconnectedness of these laws and the Roman world. The laws did not respond to a clear cause, but were the result of several historical developments, such as Augustus’ “restoration” of the Republic. Additionally, I will further the idea that laws aimed to protect Roman citizenship, by connecting this assertion to the transformation of citizenship during the reign of Augustus."

The introductory chapter gives an overview of the WWE and its play world called kayfabe, where the author justifies the conceptualization, linking WWE fan activities and WWE’s transmedia storytelling to the concept of play and games. The first chapter conceptualizes WWE audiences as players of the game, applying the concept of playful identity to establish the double experience for fans immersed in play with respect to professional wrestling storytelling. The concept of player typologies establishes roles that fans can partake in, broadly defining their motivations for their engagement with the game. In the second chapter, the focus shifts to the wrestling ring used for staging playful transmedia narratives and WWE performers interpreted as characters in the game. I explore the performative potential of these narratives, taking into account the impact of real-life texts which influence the play world of kayfabe. The role of aestheticized WWE violence is also discussed in relation with playful engagement and the boundaries of the play. Case studies showcase how WWE narratives are shaped by real life and kayfabe, and demonstrate the participatory culture that transmedia storytelling engenders amongst its publics. The theoretical framework of the third chapter derives from the concept of Ecology of Games, framing WWE’s production as a game from a cultural studies perspective, factoring the activities of various industries and societal spheres that hold a stake in the production of WWE narratives. This framing also specuates on narrative production processes being approached playfully. In the conclusion, the author explores how the WWE is changing its storytelling methods and production values due to restrictive measures in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, forcing the WWE to experiment with available resources and technology to enhance its online and digital experience for WWE fans. Potential avenues for future research into mediatized professional wrestling are explored in the final section."

At the ritual site Cepuri Parangkusumo in the Yogyakarta region, petitioners visit daily to bring offerings to the Queen of the South, a non-Islamic sea spirit. These petitioners are almost all Muslim and thus called syncretic. But syncretism is an untenable approach because it forces us to conclude that these Muslims are not fully Muslim, among other reasons. Syncretism’s replacements do not solve these issues but obscure them, which is why I collectively call them the syncretic view. This syncretic view fails because it is not an intellectual category but a perceptional one, in which the borders of religions serve as the frame of reference. Solutions must therefore not examine border-crossing, but leave open the possibility that there is no border-crossing and study why. How do local concepts of religion draw borders? We must study the Queen rituals to learn how to approach the Queen rituals. Yet it is not enough to understand a so-called syncretic case; we must allow that understanding to feed back into our paradigm so that this perceptional bias can be alleviated. A rhizomatic perspective of religion could facilitate this. I suggest that the religiosity of the Cepuri practitioners crosses no borders because their concept of religion functions within an ecology of efficacy, and through a mode of knowledge that selects for effective knowledge rather than theoretically correct knowledge. In
this frame, the Queen rituals cannot be seen as conflicting with Islam on the basis of theoretical orthodoxy. Rather, they supplement Islamic practices with other effective ways of reaching power or God’s blessings (which are themselves a form of efficacy)."

The first of these, In the USSR and Beyond (21st of September 1990 – 4th of November 1990), was the first large-scale exhibition of Soviet art at a museum in the Netherlands and was intended to introduce artists from the USSR to the Stedelijk’s Western European audience. It was also remarkably early, having taken place before the Soviet Union itself collapsed just over one year later. The second exhibition, titled Wanderlieder, was inspired by Beeren’s existing interest in the question of Europe, first demonstrated in his 1986 exhibition Correspondence Europe. In light of the importance of these exhibitions, this thesis poses two questions. Namely, what kind of conclusions can be drawn from reconstructing Wim Beeren’s In the USSR and Beyond and to what extent was the exhibition succeed at introducing this topic to an unfamiliar Western public? And how did Wim Beeren approach the question of East and West in Wanderlieder, and to what extent was the exhibition an effective answer to the changing Europe of the early 1990s?

The interviewees were asked to assess the lack of women in politics, the gender equality policies from the UN and EU and mostly the gender quotas strategy. The thesis starts by introducing the participants in details indicating their diversity. From the very start the participants made clear the main factors of women’s underrepresentation in politics. The impact of culture and stereotypes, the ineffective ways in which policies are being implemented by the government and the lack of state infrastructures regarding childcare can prevent women from getting involved with politics.
To unravel and examine each factor separately, I started the analysis by examining the Cypriot culture from a historic perspective and the social roles of Cypriot women since the 20th century. That lead me to dive more into what prompted the shifting of social roles throughout history. Women altered their roles during conflicts from solely mother/wives to agents of peacebuilders and then strikers. By taking the role of strikers, they functioned in a peaceful manner to state intensively their demands. Demands emerging from the frustration towards the government of Cyprus and its failure to implement ratified policies from the UN and EU aiming for gender equality. The interviewees in this research interpreted gender equality policies created by the UN and EU, making explicit that it’s debatable if and how gender quotas will succeed, since the strategy can stigmatize women and portray them as the vulnerable group in need of assistance. Lastly, the interviewees provided insight into the political life as a woman and a mother, pointing out the various barriers they had to overcome. The thesis indicates a set of various causes for women’s absence in the decision-making process which are hard to be resolved solely with policies implementations."

include the corrosive effects of pigeons droppings on buildings and noise complaints. The aim of this
thesis is specify suggestions for the management of urban feral pigeon populations, based on the
ecological information regarding feral pigeons (Columba livia domestica). To provide an answer to
the research question several ecological theories are examined, such as the carrying capacity, the
Lotka-Volterra model and the ecological niche. After an examination of the ecological characteristics
of feral pigeons, an overlap is detected in the needs of the feral pigeon and the offerings of urban
habitats. The preference of the feral pigeon for urban habitats can be explained by the lack of
predators, the ample availability of nesting spaces and the constant supply of food.
After defining the problem and specifying the contributing factors, the second half of the thesis
focuses on population management options that would reduce the population size of feral pigeons
in urban habitats. Since current tactics are not sufficient, long-term or keep animal welfare in mind, a
new solution needs to be found. The findings of this thesis suggest that the most effective and lasting
method of population management is based on ecological knowledge of the habitat and the species.
To reduce the number of feral pigeons in urban habitats, the habitat has to be altered in a way that it
becomes less desirable for the species. A first step could be the banning of large-scale bird feeding
and making food waste less accessible to feral pigeons. However, there is no perfect global solution.
Every urban habitat differs and has different specific ecological characteristics, therefore to
successfully propose a population management plan, specific ecological research has to be conduct
for every city that has problems regarding their feral pigeon populations."

On the other hand, it looks at how politics, history and culture have impacted gender violence in South American societies. Furthermore, this research analyses how gender and gender violence towards indigenous and disabled women is represented in the Peruvian film La teta asustada (2009) and the Venezuelan film Brecha en el silencio (2013).
Moreover, this representation of women and gender violence is analysed from an intersectional perspective. Through this intersectional approach, the cultural representation of women and gender violence will be considered as well as their interaction with different types of discrimination: ethnic, social and disabilityrelated. This analysis also takes into account imagological studies, looking at the image of the self and the Other. To conclude, this paper argues that gender violence and women’s representation has indeed developed throughout the years but nevertheless, there is still a lack of accurate representation of minority women’s groups on big screens. Additionally, despite some government’s efforts in tackling this issue, statistics show that gender violence which in several cases leads to feminicide, still plays a shocking role in Latin American societies. This emphasises the rapid growth of social grassroot movements that aim at creating awareness to the issue and help victims and survivors of gender violence to reintegrate in societies."

According to Agamben’s theory of biopolitics the state of exception has become the rule in modernity which causes everyone to be homo sacer. Agamben however, does not mention women in his works on homo sacer, even though it can be argued that their role in the biopoliticisation of life is different than that of men. By analysing Children of Men in terms of reproductive futurism I will be able to prove how a narrative that is concerned with escaping the present is inextricably connected to biopolitics, supporting Agamben’s claim that biopolitical logics are inherent in modernity. Because Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale has a stronger focus on the feminist aspects of reproductive futurism I will analyse this text next to Children of Men, in order to give a fuller understanding of how the biopolitical logics of reproductive futurism are inherent in modernity. Eventually I will be able to conclude that both texts uphold reproductive futuristic ideas, causing them to reproduce the biopolitical logics they ostensibly criticise and by doing so the texts demonstrate the inescapability of biopolitics in modernity."
Hydrogen production on offshore platforms. A techno-economic analysis.,"['Donkers, K.M.']","['Eichhammer, Prof. Dr. W.']",2020-09-04T18:00:50Z,en,"['Hydrogen, Offshore, North, Sea, Electrolysis, Oil, Gas, Grid, Levelized, Cost, Of, Hydrogen']",Energy Science,"It is essential for the world to reassess its energy production technologies, because of the ever-growing energy demand and the developing climate awareness. One of the energy production technologies that is reaching the end of its lifetime is the oil and gas production on the Dutch Continental Shelf (DCS). As of 2019, around 150 installations are operative in this DCS. In the coming ten years, 100 of the 150 installations will be decommissioned. Approximately 10% of these 150 platforms can be re-used for future activities such as carbon capture and storage and hydrogen production. Hydrogen can play an important role in the energy transition. Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy sources, is seen as a promising technology that might enable an energy system using renewable energy on a large scale. Advantages of green hydrogen are its ability of decoupling supply and demand for energy due to its storage capacity and its ability to be transported and stored in large quantities. 
This research presents a techno-economic analysis of the costs of producing hydrogen on decommissioned offshore platforms using offshore renewable energy sources. Aim of this analysis is to compare these production costs with projected costs of producing green hydrogen using other renewable and conventional energy sources. The analysis resulted in a levelized cost of hydrogen ranging from 4.90 €/kg in the most positive scenario, where electrolyzer costs are low and hydrogen is transported to shore using existing pipelines, to 10.81 €/kg in the high cost scenarios. This is significantly higher than expected production costs of 3 €/kg of green hydrogen in 2030 as presented in existing literature. Based on the outcomes of the analysis, and using the assumptions made in this research, a competitive price cannot be reached. Future research must show whether a combination of a decreasing electricity price and an increase in capacity factor can improve the economic feasibility of offshore hydrogen production. Due to the decommissioning of offshore infrastructure and the increasing urge to find energy storage options for the growing share of intermittent renewable energy in the energy mix, offshore hydrogen production is seen as a concept with potential. This research shows however, that significant cost reduction is necessary to make offshore hydrogen production on existing platforms economically viable."
The Nature of Maussollos’s Monarchy.

It shall be argued that he represented himself and was represented in three different ways – giving him three different ‘’faces’’. He represented himself as an exalted ruler concerning his private dedications and architecture, ever inching closer to deification, but not taking that final step. His deification was to be post mortem. Concerning diplomacy between him and the poleis, he adopted a realpolitik approach, allowing for much self-governance in return for accepting his authority. Maussollos strongly continued the dynastic image set up by his father Hekatomnos concerning the importance of Zeus Labraundos and his Sanctuary at Labraunda, turning the Sanctuary into the major Karian sanctuary. This dynastic parallel can also be seen concerning Hekatomnos’s and Maussollos’s burials, with both being buried as oikistes in terraced tombs, both the inner sanctums depicting Totenmahl-motifs and both being deified after death. Hekatomnos introduced coinage featuring Zeus Labraundos wielding a spear, representing spear-won land. Maussollos adopted this imagery and added Halikarnassian Apollo on the obverse depicting the locations of his two paradeisoi. As for titulature, the Hekatomnids in general eschewed using any which has led to confusion in the ancient sources, but the Hekatomnids were the satraps of Karia, ruling their native land on behalf of the Persian King. All in all, Maussollos portrayed many characteristics of Hellenistic kingship, though the interpretation and context of these characteristics varied."
Supporting Intrinsic Motivation through IBL: Scaffolding a Physics Experiment,"['Reijerkerk, M.S.']","['Meulenbroeks, R.F.G.']",2020-09-04T18:00:45Z,en,"['Intrinsic motivation, Self-determination Theory, Inquiry-based Learning, scaffolding, radiation physics education, Ionizing Radiation Practical']",Science Education and Communication,"This study investigates the dynamics between scaffolding of inquiry based learning (IBL) and intrinsic motivation for the task at hand. Within the context of an IBL version of a 11th/12th grade physics practical (Ionising Radiation Practical), a literature survey and analysis of earlier research results was followed by two cycles of design-based research. Based on scaffolding categories from literature, earlier qualitative research was revisited, demonstrating that during the IBL work students were reporting difficulties in terms of two main areas: process knowledge, i.e., how to approach the practical and nonsalient tasks, e.g., how to use the equipment involved. Based on these results, two design cycle iterations were performed, with a total of 17 students participating in focus group interviews after each iteration. After trying out the final redesign, students reported an increase in perceived competence support, while still retaining a sense of autonomy. Moreover, student remarks suggest that the scope of support for intrinsic motivation went beyond the scaffolding itself. The results suggest that appropriate scaffolding can increase students’ competency, while retaining their autonomy, thus supporting more autonomous types of motivation in the Self-Determination Theory. Implications for education and suggestions for further quantitative research are proposed."
A Theatre of Cyborgs and Zombies: Mapping the Performance of Sacred Ritual at the Altar of Popular Culture,"['Kapor, A.']","['Kattenbelt, M.J.']",2020-09-04T18:00:37Z,en,"['media, ritual, technology']","Media, Art and Performance studies","Ever since the ancients, ritual has played a central role in human society. Traditionally exercised within a context of religious or spiritual belief systems, in late industrial and globalized society one finds its position increasingly challenged by the changing cultural landscape, in which the central role of religion in constructing shared narratives and social cohesion has been replaced by the dominant discourse of popular culture. Within this environment, the ritualistic methods are adapted to fit a new paradigm; one that is increasingly technocratic, commodifying, and dependent on structures of media power. This affects both the performance of ritual and the production of meaning which underpins the functional structures of society and its embedded values. In the following research I will attempt to map out how ritual, as the foundational element of the sociocultural apparatus, is challenged and transformed by its entanglement with new media technologies that are at work in the production, dissemination and consumption of pop culture, and how this affects both the individual participating subject as well as the broader society of which they are a part. If our society is indeed fundamentally constructed through the dynamic interplay of belief systems and associated practices, then having a deeper understanding of the role of new technologies and their various implications is essential. What I aim to achieve in this thesis is to develop a conceptual vocabulary as a set of tools to analyze and understand how the performance of ritualistic behaviors in a technocratically mediatized environment shapes the very discourse which produces it, and the implications this might have on how we should aim to participate in it."

The context is physics secondary education in the Netherlands. Semi-structured interviews with five physics teachers, three university physics teacher trainers, as well as a coach of teachers and a student coach have been conducted. The coded results suggest that teachers need support throughout their career: they need to learn to differentiate their instruction in teacher training, and their school management needs to facilitate and stimulate teachers to do so, as well as to foster a professional climate where teachers learn from each other.

Title: Pain measurement and documentation in patients visiting the outpatient clinic of the Department of Medical Oncology.
Background: Pain is common in patients with cancer but is underreported and undertreated in one-third of patients with cancer-related pain. Because the treatment of cancer has shifted more to the outpatient setting, it is important that health care professionals (HCPs) who consult the patient pay attention to pain at the outpatient clinic. 
Aim: The primary aim was to examine how HCPs conduct pain measurement and documentation in patients with cancer at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Medical Oncology. The secondary aim was to examine barriers and facilitators affecting HCPs in using pain assessment instruments among patients with cancer at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Medical Oncology. 
Method: For this cross-sectional observational study, data was collected through a digital survey. Analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and a Mann-Whitney test.
Results: Pain measurement is often or always executed by nurse practitioners (72%) or oncologists (64%) during the consult (84%) and mostly reported in clinical notes (76%). Barriers for using pain assessment instruments are not being motivated by management or direct colleagues and the absence of reminders to use pain assessment instruments. Facilitators are encouragement by direct colleagues, using pain assessment instruments based on evidence and the presence of someone who actively takes charge in working with such instruments. We could not detect any differences in barriers and facilitators in hospitals that do (not) perform pain measurement was determined.
Conclusion: Pain assessment in patients with cancer visiting the outpatient clinic of the Department of Medical Oncology is mostly performed in the traditional way by the HCP asking the patient about pain and report this in clinical notes.
Recommendations: Investigate different (digital) ways to perform pain assessment and explore patient’s experiences and expectations on discussing this topic during the consult.
 
Samenvatting	
Titel: Pijnmeting en -registratie bij patiënten op de polikliniek Medische Oncologie.
Achtergrond: Pijn is een veel voorkomend symptoom bij patiënten met kanker en wordt te weinig gerapporteerd en behandeld bij een derde van de patiënten met kanker gerelateerde pijn. De behandeling van kanker vindt steeds meer plaats op de polikliniek en daarom is het belangrijk om als zorgverlener aandacht te hebben voor pijn bij patiënten op de polikliniek.
Doel: Het primaire doel is het onderzoeken hoe pijnmeting en registratie uitgevoerd wordt bij patiënten met kanker op de polikliniek Medische Oncologie. Het secundaire doel is het onderzoeken welke belemmerende en bevorderende factoren van invloed zijn op het gebruik van pijnscreeningsinstrumenten bij patiënten met kanker op de polikliniek Medische Oncologie. 
Methode: In dit cross-sectionele onderzoek is data verzameld met een digitale vragenlijst. Data is geanalyseerd met behulp van beschrijvende statistiek en een Mann-Whitney test.
Resultaten: Pijnmeting wordt meestal verricht door een verpleegkundig specialist (72%) of oncoloog (64%) tijdens het consult (84%) en genoteerd in decursus (76%). Belemmerende factoren in het gebruik van pijnscreeningsinstrumenten zijn: geen motivatie door directe collega’s of management en niet worden herinnerd aan het gebruik van pijnscreeningsinstrumenten. Bevorderende factoren zijn: aanmoediging door directe collega’s, gebruik maken van een pijnscreeningsinstrument dat ontwikkeld is op basis van wetenschappelijk bewijs en de aanwezigheid van iemand die actief de leiding neemt in het gebruik van pijnscreeningsinstrumenten. Er is geen verschil vastgesteld in bevorderende en belemmerende factoren tussen ziekenhuizen die (geen) structurele pijnmeting uitvoeren.
Conclusie: Pijnmeting bij patiënten met kanker op de polikliniek Medische Oncologie wordt meestal uitgevoerd op de traditionele manier: de zorgverlener vraagt naar pijn bij de patiënt tijdens het consult en noteert dit in decursus. 
Aanbevelingen: Het onderzoeken van verschillende (digitale) manieren om een pijnmeting af te nemen en exploreren van de ervaringen en verwachtingen van patiënten omtrent de bespreking van dit onderwerp tijdens een consult."
The association between resilience and self-care in heart failure (HF) patients: a cross-sectional study.,"['Rijn, M.M. van']","['Weldam, S.', 'Jaarsma, T.']",2020-09-07T18:00:23Z,en,"['Resilience, Self-care, Patient, Heart Failure, Veerkracht, Zelfzorg, Patiënten, Hartfalen']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Self-care is the cornerstone of therapy to treat HF and to improve outcomes from HF. Despite the positive health outcomes of self-care, patients have difficulty mastering it. The continuous and complex demands of self-care can be seen as stressful and may require patients to apply resilient behaviours as they battle this disease. Resilience may be a helpful factor in performing self-care.Aim: To explore the association between resilience and the performance of self-care in HF patients.Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in the HF outpatient clinic at an University Medical Centre between January and May 2020. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire, and multiple regression analysis was performed to determine whether resilience was associated with self-care. Analyses were adjusted for the predetermined confounders: age, gender, marital status, education, and depressive symptoms.Results: Sixty-five patients were included, and 57 patients completed the questionnaire. Resilience was significantly associated with self-care maintenance (β.27; p&lt;.05) in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, self-care maintenance (β-.30; p&lt;.05) and monitoring (β-.40; p&lt;.01) were significantly associated with low education. There were no associations between resilience and self-care monitoring and management. Resilience was strongly associated with self-care confidence (β.51; p&lt;.01).Conclusion and implications: This study demonstrated an association between resilience and self-care maintenance. Associations between resilience, self-care management, and monitoring cannot be confirmed yet. This study contributes to the body of knowledge of influencing factors for self-care. It is recommended to pay attention to the degree of resilience in patients, and to provide tailor-made information about self-care. Further research, such as a longitudinal study, is needed to demonstrate a causation between resilience and self-care.

Achtergrond: Zelfzorg is één van de belangrijkste uitgangspunten voor de behandeling tegen hartfalen en om de gezondheidsuitkomsten van hartfalen te verbeteren. Ondanks de positieve gezondheidsresultaten van zelfzorg bij hartfalen, hebben patiënten moeite met het uitvoeren van adequate zelfzorg. De voortdurende en complexe eisen van zelfzorg kunnen als stressvol worden ervaren en kan betekenen dat patiënten veerkrachtige methoden moeten gebruiken gedurende het ziekteproces. Veerkracht kan een helpende factor zijn bij het uitvoeren van zelfzorg. Doel: Het onderzoeken van de associatie tussen veerkracht en het uitvoeren van zelfzorg bij hartfalen patiënten. Methode: Een cross-sectionele studie werd uitgevoerd tussen januari en mei 2020 in de hartfalenpoli van een universitair ziekenhuis. Patiënten werden gevraagd een vragenlijst in te vullen en met multipele regressieanalyse werd bepaald of veerkracht geassocieerd was met zelfzorg. Analyses werden aangepast voor de vooraf bepaalde confounders: leeftijd, geslacht, burgerlijke staat, opleiding, en depressieve symptomen.  Resultaten: Vijfenzestig patiënten werden geïncludeerd en 57 patiënten vulden de vragenlijst in. Veerkracht was significant geassocieerd met zelfzorgbehoud (β .27; p&lt;.04) in de univariate analyse. In de multivariate analyse waren zelfzorgbehoud (β -.30; p&lt;.05) en monitoring (β -.40; p&lt;.01) significant geassocieerd met een laag scholingsniveau. Er waren geen associaties tussen veerkracht en zelfzorgmanagement. Veerkracht was sterk geassocieerd met zelfzorgvertrouwen (β .51; p&lt;.01).  Conclusie en implicaties: Deze studie toonde een associatie tussen veerkracht en zelfzorgbehoud. Associaties tussen veerkracht en zelfzorgmanagement en -monitoring kunnen nog niet worden bevestigd. Deze studie draagt bij aan de kennis van beïnvloedende factoren voor zelfzorg. Het wordt aanbevolen om aandacht te besteden aan de mate van veerkracht bij patiënten en om zelfzorginformatie op maat te geven. Vervolgonderzoek, zoals een longitudinale studie, is nodig om een oorzakelijk verband tussen veerkracht en zelfzorg aan te tonen."
"Physical, mental and cognitive functioning in daily life of former Dutch Intensive Care patients, who perceive a decline in quality of life, one year after ICU admission.

Background As a result of improving treatments in intensive care medicine, more patients survive severe illness. Long-term consequences of an Intensive Care (ICU) admission, referred to as Post Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS), can have serious impact on a patient’s health and quality of life (QoL). Research into the experiences of Dutch ICU survivors with functioning in daily life, perceived health and QoL is scarce. 
Aim To gain insight into the experienced quality of life and the physical, mental and cognitive functioning in daily life of former intensive care patients, who perceive a decline in quality of life, one year after ICU-admission.
Method Fifteen ICU survivors, who indicated a decline in the PCS and MCS of the SF-36 questionnaire were interviewed in a generic qualitative study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted face to face and by (video)call. The interview-guide was based on the PROMIS framework, exploring physical, mental (including cognitive-) and social health. QoL was added as a domain, because of its importance to ICU-patients.
Results Theoretical analysis was applied and identified 25 themes within the 4 PROMIS domains. Major issues were cognitive problems with impaired memory and concentration, physical limitations in mobility, decreased stamina, fatigue and changed priorities and relationships. Impairments had impact on the performance of work and hobbies. Aspects such as acceptance and being independent increased QoL. Most patients found their QoL sufficient.
Conclusion Most participants indicated impairments in one or more domains of physical, mental (cognitive-) and social health. Although Health Related QoL was decreased, most participants rated their QoL as sufficient.
Recommendation Having knowledge of the outcomes in health domains and QoL of ICU-patients is relevant for caregivers. It can help them to improve healthcare and policy decisions."
Home care nurses’ views regarding nursing documentation in relation to perceived documentation burden: a focus group study.,"['Munster, A.M.']","['Francke, Prof. dr. A.L.', 'de Groot, Drs. K.']",2020-09-07T18:00:21Z,en,['Home care services; registered nurses; nursing documentation; documentation burden; electronic health record'],Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Accurate nursing documentation is essential for providing safe and efficient patient care. Increased documentation influences nurses’ documentation burden. Literature indicates that challenges with the electronic health record (EHR) documentation may affect the perceived documentation burden. Thus, an improved understanding of the perceived documentation burden is needed.
Aims: The study aims to gain in-depth knowledge about the views of home care nurses regarding nursing documentation in relation to perceived documentation burden. The secondary aim is to explore whether these views vary between home care nurses with different educational levels. 
Method: This study was conducted following an explorative, qualitative design using homogeneous focus groups (nurses with bachelor’s degrees) and heterogeneous focus groups (nurses with bachelor’s and secondary degrees). The transcripts were analysed using the thematic analysis method by Braun and Clarke (2006).
Results: A total of four focus groups (n = 28) were conducted: one face-to-face and three online. Several factors were found to increase the perceived documentation burden: the lack of perceived usefulness and importance of the documentation, which was higher for organisation-related documentation compared to client-related documentation; non-user-friendly EHR systems; lack of information exchange among healthcare professionals; organisational characteristics such as low level of organisational support; and poor integration of different documentation systems. Nurses with bachelor’s degrees experienced a higher documentation burden than nurses with secondary degrees.
Conclusion and recommendations: Documentation burden is caused by various factors. Home care nurses should be assisted by user-friendly EHR systems in which information can be transferred from other healthcare professionals’ systems. Additionally, organisations should work closely with nurses to critically assess their documentation activities. Future research should focus on further investigating the differences between home care nurses with bachelor’s and secondary degrees."
Experiences and needs of certified nursing assistants regarding coaching by bachelor educated nurses in nursing homes: A qualitative study,"['Kuppenveld, M. van']","['Persoon, A.']",2020-09-07T18:00:20Z,en,"['Certified nursing assistants, bachelor educated nurses, coaching, nursing homes, qualitative research']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Dutch nursing home care has become increasingly complex. Quality of nursing home care is endangered since certified nursing assistants are expected to provide high complex care while being educated to provide low complex care. For certified nursing assistants to remain competent, coaching by bachelor educated nurses is required. However, knowledge is lacking on how bachelor educated nurses can provide valid coaching explicitly to certified nursing assistants. Insight into experiences and needs of certified nursing assistants enables bachelor educated nurses to achieve coaching validity. 
Aim: The aim of this study was to gain insight into experiences and needs of certified nursing assistants regarding coaching by bachelor educated nurses in nursing homes. 
Method: A generic qualitative multicenter design was applied. Certified nursing assistants were purposively selected from five nursing homes. Semi-structured face-to-face and telephone interviews were conducted in March and April 2020. Analysis relied on Braun and Clarke’s thematic analysis.
Results: Two main themes emerged: bachelor educated nurses prerequisites and value of bachelor educated nurses. Certified nursing assistants (n = 9) defined prerequisites within the scope of: retaining autonomy, being visible and reachable, adapting communication style, clarifying job description, participating in care, and being equal. Certified nursing assistants perceived bachelor educated nurses as valuable when bachelor educated nurses fulfill coaching needs of certified nursing assistants through empowering, educating, and being an intermediary between management and certified nursing assistants.
Conclusion: When bachelor educated nurses meet the described prerequisites with the support of nursing home managers, bachelor educated nurses can demonstrate their value and provide valid coaching to certified nursing assistants. Future research is necessary on the perspectives of bachelor educated nurses and nursing home managers to gain a comprehensive understanding of coaching."
Wishes and preferences of nursing home residents regarding Advance Care Planning – A qualitative study.,"['Zwekars, M.J.G.A.']","['Echteld, M.A.']",2020-09-07T18:00:22Z,en,"['nursing, palliative care, advance care planning, nursing home, frail elderly']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Advance Care Planning is a communication process aiming at aligning the care goals with patients’ wishes and values, ahead of the commencement of care. This is particularly important in palliative patients with a limited life expectancy. In nursing homes Advance Care Planning helps residents plan care. However, little is known about residents’ wishes and preferences regarding Advance Care Planning.  Aim: This study aimed at gaining insight into Dutch nursing home residents’ wishes regarding Advance Care Planning.  Method: An observational, descriptive study was conducted. Data collection consisted of semi-structured interviews with nursing home residents from March until June 2020. Analyses were performed by using the six-phase analysis framework of Braun and Clark. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) framework was used to guide reporting.  
Results: Three main themes emerged: Perception of life and health, power of family, and role and position in society. Through conversations with community dwelling octogenarians (n=16), multiple factors that influence the individual Quality of Life were identified. These factors can both have a positive, and have a diminishing effect on the individual Quality of Life.   Conclusion: This study provides insight in which factors influence the daily individual Quality of Life of community dwelling octogenarians. These identified factors can give direction to how healthcare workers can target their care to improve the individual Quality of Life. Furthermore, education for health care workers should include the knowledge generated by this study to prepare them in a better way for the care of this particular group. Future research should include a more inclusive sample, gaining an even more comprehensive understanding of the factors which that influence individual Quality of Life of community dwelling octogenarians."
Exploring Experiences of Informal Caregivers with Hospital Care at Home for patients with Heart Failure,"['Nieuwenhuis, E.M.']","['Groen-van de Ven, L.']",2020-09-07T18:00:20Z,en_US,"['Informal Caregivers, Hospital based Home Care Services, Heart Failure, Nursing, Experiences']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background Hospital care at home is a nurse-led program for patients with deteriorated heart failure with continuous intravenous medication. Informal caregivers of patients with heart failure are known to experience problems with their own well-being, having insufficient support and have lack of knowledge. These may increase during the program. However, the experiences of informal caregivers with hospital care at home are yet unknown. 
Aim The study aims to explore the experiences with hospital care at home of the informal caregivers of patients who were enrolled in the hospital care at home program for deteriorated heart failure.
Method A generic explorative qualitative study was conducted, with use of semi-structured interviews of informal caregivers. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis by Braun and Clarke. 
Results During the analysis of the ten interviews five themes emerged: 1)Motivations for hospital at home, where informal caregivers saw it as their task as significant other, 2)Process of the program, where informal caregivers lacked information, 3)Mental load for informal caregiver, 4)Persevere hospital at home program and 5)Context, where home situation and patient characteristics influenced the burden of informal caregivers.
Conclusion Informal caregivers had doubts about safety by lacking information about the program. Their home situation and the patient characteristics influenced the burden of the informal caregivers. However, they saw it as their task as significant other to take the role of informal caregiver during the program.
Implications of key findings It is recommended to investigate how informal caregivers can be educated about the program. Also, health professionals involved in the program need to be aware of the context of the informal caregiver and patient in order to arrange a sufficient support system."
What predicts the success of functional recovery after lung transplantation – a retrospective cohort study,"['Grootel, J.W.M. van']","['Valkenet, K.']",2020-09-07T18:00:19Z,en,"['lung transplantation, LTx, functional recovery, lung disease, survival']",Fysiotherapiewetenschap,"ABSTRACT
Background: Lung transplantation (LTx) is an intensive medical treatment with a high risk of complications, decreased physical functioning and mortality. Functional recovery in the early phase after LTx differs greatly between patients and can influence hospital length of stay and long term physical functioning. 
Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate if preoperative physical function parameters predict the functional recovery after LTx. 
Patients and Methods: Patients who underwent screening and LTx at the University Medical Centre of Utrecht between January 2001 and February 2020 were included. Preoperative physical function parameters and conventional risk factors were entered in a Cox Proportional Hazards model. The primary outcome was the time to walk in the hospital room for the first time after LTx. 
Results: A total of 225 patients were included for data analysis. Preoperative physical function parameters were not significant in multivariate analysis. A hazard ratio of 1.663 (p=0.024) and 0.983 (p=0.039) was found for bilateral LTx and age, respectively. 
Conclusion and key findings: We found preoperative physical function parameters not to be associated with functional recovery after LTx, measured as the time to walk in the hospital room for the first time after LTx. At this moment it is too early to change the physiotherapeutic screening of LTx candidates. Functional recovery needs to be reinvestigated and defined differently in further research, to determine the role of preoperative physical function parameters in screening LTx candidates."

Applied interventions by surgical nurses when “nurses’ worry” is present: A qualitative focus-group study,"['Peerboom, F.B.A.L.']","['Schoonhoven, L.']",2020-09-07T18:00:29Z,en,"['“Nursing Staff, Hospital”[Mesh]; “Perioperative Nursing”[Mesh]; “Qualitative Research”[Mesh]; Worry; Interventions.']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Abstract

TITLE Applied interventions by surgical nurses when “nurses’ worry” is present.
BACKGROUND Hospital nurses commonly observe and respond to deterioration using the Early Warning Score (EWS). Surgical ward nurses are highly engaged in the process of early recognition of and response to deterioration. These deterioration responses are based on deviating vital signs, while nurses also act on more subjective indicators like worry. Both scientific literature and (inter)national guidelines do not mention any information about acting upon nurses’ worry. 
AIM To gain an in-depth understanding of the interventions nurses on surgical wards apply when “nurses’ worry” is present and the EWS does not indicate deterioration (EWS≥3).
METHOD A generic qualitative focus-group study with registered surgical nurses working at a hospital in the Netherlands was performed. Data was collected by focus-group interviews supported by vignettes. Data was analyzed thematically.
RESULTS Four focus-group interviews were conducted. Two sequential themes emerged from the data: ‘Searching for explanation and confirmation’ and ‘Responding by actively applying nursing interventions’. Nurses first gathered additional information about the patient and searched for a reference point. Nurses also approached others for co-assessment and verification of their observations, but held back in contacting physicians. Hereafter, nurses responded by applying nursing interventions.
CONCLUSION Nurses mainly try to formalize an in-depth understanding of their feeling of worry to convince a physician to accurately treat the patient. Spending much time on a search to this understanding leads to delays in escalating care. 
IMPLICATIONS Nurses and physicians should make agreements on how to act when nurses’ worry is present. In addition, after increasing the amount of scientific evidence on this subject, policy making is needed to create a standardized procedure when nurses’ worry is present.

TITEL Toegepaste interventies door chirurgische verpleegkundigen wanneer een niet-pluisgevoel aanwezig is.
ACHTERGROND Ziekenhuisverpleegkundigen observeren en reageren op klinische verslechtering van patiënten door middel van de Early Warning Score (EWS). Chirurgische verpleegkundigen hebben veel ervaring met de vroege herkenning van en reactie op klinische verslechtering. Deze reacties zijn gebaseerd op afwijkende vitale waarden, terwijl verpleegkundigen ook reageren op subjectieve indicatoren zoals een niet-pluisgevoel. Zowel wetenschappelijke literatuur als (inter)nationale richtlijnen bevatten geen informatie over het handelen op een niet-pluisgevoel.
DOEL Het verkrijgen van een diepgaand inzicht in de interventies die verpleegkundigen op chirurgische verpleegafdelingen toepassen wanneer een niet-pluisgevoel aanwezig is en de EWS niet duidt op klinische verslechtering (EWS≥3).
METHODE Een generiek kwalitatief focusgroep onderzoek met gediplomeerde chirurgische verpleegkundigen werkzaam in een Nederlands ziekenhuis werd verricht. Data werd verzameld door focusgroep-interviews die ondersteund werden door vignetten. Data werd thematisch geanalyseerd.
RESULTATEN Vier focus-groep interviews zijn uitgevoerd. Uit de data volgden twee opeenvolgende thema’s: ‘Op zoek naar uitleg en bevestiging’ en ‘Reageren door actieve toepassing van verpleegkundige interventies’. Allereerst verzamelden de verpleegkundigen aanvullende patiënten-informatie en zochten ze naar een referentiepunt. Verpleegkundigen benaderden bovendien collega’s voor medebeoordeling en verificatie van hun observaties, maar waren terughoudend in het contacteren van artsen. Uiteindelijk reageerden verpleegkundigen door verpleegkundige interventies toe te passen.
CONCLUSIE Verpleegkundigen proberen vooral een diepgaand begrip van hun niet-pluisgevoel te formuleren om een arts ervan te overtuigen de patiënt accuraat te behandelen. Het besteden van veel tijd aan de zoektocht naar dit begrip leidt tot vertragingen in het escaleren van patiëntenzorg. 
IMPLICATIES Verpleegkundigen en artsen zouden afspraken moeten maken over hoe te handelen bij een niet-pluisgevoel. Bovendien is, na het creëren van meer wetenschappelijk bewijs, beleidsvorming nodig om een gestandaardiseerde procedure te ontwikkelen voor wanneer een niet-pluisgevoel aanwezig is.

Title: Exploring factors of patient safety at home from the perspective of home care nurses in the Netherlands: A qualitative study 
Background: Despite the increase of home care, literature about patient safety at home and factors that contribute to patient safety at home among frail, older people is limited. Knowing which factors home care nurses believe are affecting patient safety at home is necessary to develop a valid instrument to identify complex situations.
Aim: To explore factors that affect patient safety at home among frail, older people with home care from perceived by home care nurses. 
Method: A generic qualitative design was used, and semi-structured interviews were conducted between March and April 2020 in the Netherlands. Interviews were transcribed verbatim following by the thematical analysis of Braun and Clarke. 
Results: A total of twelve interviews were conducted by phone. Identified themes were factors on the patient level: physical, mental and cognitive factors, emotion and behaviour, patient autonomy affected patient safety at home, factors on the professional level: limitations and requirements to ensure patient safety at home by home care nurses, policy factors: exterior amenities, amenities inside home and the organization culture affected patient safety at home and environmental factors: lack of insight of informal caregivers, involved informal caregivers, lack of informal caregivers, lack of financial resources, house characteristics and unsafe living conditions affected patient safety at home. 
Conclusion: Patient autonomy, lack of informal caregivers and their lack of insight, long waiting lists for nursing homes and a lack of guidelines were the main factors determined to affect patient safety at home. 
Implication of key findings: Future research should focus on developing evidence-based guidelines to help home care nurses signalling unsafe situations at home. In addition, home care nurses should focus on efficient collaboration with other disciplines to share knowledge about patient safety at home. 




Samenvatting
Titel: Factoren over de patiëntveiligheid in de thuissituatie verkennen vanuit het perspectief van wijkverpleegkundigen in Nederland: een kwalitatieve studie.  
Achtergrond: Ondanks de stijging van thuiszorg is er weinig bekend in de literatuur en zijn factoren die bijdragen aan de patiëntveiligheid in de thuissituatie bij kwetsbare ouderen onbekend. Wetende welke factoren volgens wijkverpleegkundigen invloed hebben op de patiëntveiligheid kan helpen om in de toekomst een valide instrument te ontwikkelen die de wijkverpleegkundigen helpt een complex situatie te signaleren. 
Doelen: Het verkennen van factoren die invloed hebben op de patiëntveiligheid in de thuissituatie bij kwetsbare ouderen, verkregen bij wijkverpleegkundigen. 
Methode: Een algemene kwalitatieve studie is gebruikt. Daarbij zijn semigestructureerde interviews uitgevoerd tussen maart en april 2020. Deze interviews zijn getranscribeerd en geanalyseerd met behulp van een thematische analyse. 
Resultaten:  In totaal zijn er twaalf telefonische interviews gehouden. Thema’s: factoren op patiëntniveau: fysieke, mentale en cognitieve factoren, autonomie van de client en emotie en gedrag beïnvloeden de patiëntveiligheid in de thuissituatie, factoren op professioneel niveau: beperkingen en vereisten voor wijkverpleegkundigen om de patiëntveiligheid in de thuissituatie te waarborgen, omgevingsfactoren:  gebrek aan inzicht van de mantelzorgers, gebrek aan mantelzorgers en betrokken mantelzorgers beïnvloeden de patiëntveiligheid in de thuissituatie en beleidsfactoren: externe voorzieningen, voorzieningen in huis en de organisatorische cultuur hebben invloed op de patiëntveiligheid in de thuissituatie. 
Conclusies: De autonomie van de patiënt, het gebrek aan mantelzorg en het gebrek aan hun inzicht, lange wachtlijsten voor verpleeghuizen en gebrek aan richtlijnen waren de belangrijkste factoren die een negatieve invloed hebben op de patiëntveiligheid in de thuissituatie. 
Aanbevelingen: Verder onderzoek zou zich moeten focussen op het ontwikkelen van een evidence-based richtlijn om wijkverpleegkundigen te helpen complexe en onveilige thuissituaties te signaleren. Ondertussen in de huidige praktijk zouden wijkverpleegkundigen zich moeten richten op een effectieve samenwerking met andere disciplines en het delen van kennis over patiëntveiligheid in de thuissituatie.

Development of a questionnaire regarding the communication of patients’ perspectives in palliative care: A qualitative study,"['Dieën, M.S.H. van']","['Uitdehaag, Dr. MJ', 'de Man-van Ginkel, Dr. JM']",2020-09-07T18:00:28Z,en,"['Palliative care [MeSH], patients’ perspectives, surveys and questionnaires [MeSH].']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Paying attention to patients’ perspectives improves quality of life and tailored care. Despite this, only a minority of Heart Failure (HF) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients effectively convey their preferences and wishes in conversations with healthcare professionals. In order to empower HF and COPD patients in communicating their perspectives during consultation, a toolbox has been developed in the EMpowerment of PATIEnts and their informal caregivers project. But what influence does the use of interventions such as this toolbox have? A valid Dutch measurement instrument is required to measure to what extent patients identify, communicate and document their preferences and wishes.  
Aim: This study aims to explore which items should be included in a questionnaire according to HF and COPD patients, informal caregivers and healthcare professionals to measure the extent to which the patient perspective is addressed in the communication between patients and healthcare professionals. 
Method: This is a generic, descriptive qualitative study. Secondary analysis of individual semi-structured interviews (n=30) was performed using thematic analysis.  
Results: The identified items were: 1) wishes regarding end of life; 2) wishes regarding medical treatment; 3) wishes regarding daily life; 4) the need for autonomy; 5) the need for information; 6) social-emotional needs; 7) the need for identity. In addition, facilitators and barriers to identifying, communicating and documenting wishes and needs were indicated. 
Conclusion: By including these items, the questionnaire will fully reflect patients’ perspectives and will give insight into which interventions seems to support the patient in communicating their unique perspectives in order to provide tailored care.  
Recommendations: It is recommended to check the correctness and completeness of the items identified among the target groups with a view to the generalizability of the results and the validity of the questionnaire."
The current use of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures to measure pain and factors associated with pain scores in patients with non-specific neck pain,"['Hemmer, W.']","['van der Net, J.J.']",2020-09-07T18:00:30Z,en,"['non-specific neck pain, PROM use, multiple regression']",Fysiotherapiewetenschap,"Background: Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) to measure pain are highly recommended and may improve quality of health care physiotherapy. Although, little is known about PROMs use in primary care physiotherapy to measure pain, and if the use leads to differences in number of treatment sessions in non-specific neck pain patients. Besides, understanding what determines the pain score may help physiotherapists to make better management decisions in affecting non-specific neck pain. 
Aim: This study assessed 1) the current use of PROMs to measure pain in Dutch primary healthcare physiotherapy, 2) differences in number of treatment sessions between PROM and non-PROM evaluated patients, and 3) patient- and physiotherapist-related variables associated with pain scores in non-specific neck pain patients.
Methods An observational study was conducted, based on electronic health record data in the Nivel Primary Care Database of the year 2018. A total of 1,412 patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed with non-specific neck pain and treated by a primary care physiotherapist were included. Descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney-U tests were used to explore the current use of PROMs and differences in the number of treatment sessions between PROM evaluated and non-PROM evaluated patients. A backward multiple regression analysis was used to identify associated factors with the change in pain score.
Results: Twenty-seven percent of the included patients were evaluated by using PROMs to measure pain. Three hundred eighty-six PROM evaluated patients (mean age 49±17) and 1,026 non-PROM evaluated patients (mean age 49±17) showed that the number of treatment sessions was significantly higher in PROM evaluated patients (7.1±4.5) than non-PROM evaluated patients (6.3±5.0). Multiple regression showed the age of the patient and the number of treatment sessions as associated variables on the change of pain score. Thirty-eight percent of the proportion in variance is explained by our model.
Conclusion and key findings: This study showed that the minority of non-specific neck pain patients were evaluated by PROMs in Dutch primary care physiotherapy. PROM evaluated patients showed a higher number of treatment sessions. The age of the patient and the number of treatments were found as associated variables on the change of pain score."
Supporting spiritual care in patient care: a qualitative study of barriers and facilitators of hospital nurses in the role of Link Nurse Spiritual Care,"['Kuik, A.H.']","['Cusveller, B.']",2020-09-07T18:00:28Z,en_US,"['Barriers, facilitators, link nurse, hospital, spiritual care']",Verplegingswetenschap,"BACKGROUND For many hospitalized patients, spiritual care is important. However, the spiritual dimension is not always an integrated part of nurses’ professional behavior. Previous research showed that the appointment of Link Nurses Spiritual Care (LNSCs) in a hospital can lead, in the short term, to a greater awareness of the spiritual needs of patients in nurses and more regular and competent provision of spiritual care. It is therefore important to find strategies to sustain these positive outcomes. Identifying facilitators of and tackling barriers to spiritual care is therefore important to achieve consistent improvements.
AIM This study explores hospital nurses’ experiences of the barriers to and facilitators of their ability to competently perform their role as LNSC with regard to spiritual care support, one year after implementation of the role.
METHOD A generic descriptive qualitative approach was used. Semi-structured interviews with LNSCs led by an interview guide were performed. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis.
RESULTS Eight LNSCs were interviewed. Four themes were identified: professional confidence, time, support and coaching, and team culture. These themes were theorized as factors, the presence of which act as a facilitator, while their absence acts as a barrier to performing the LNSC role competently. In this study, the lack of time for the role was the greatest barrier for the participants, while support and coaching was the most present factor, making it the greatest facilitator.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS Results from this study indicate that to sustain the promising results from previous research, all four factors should be strengthened. Emphasis should be placed on the key factors of professional confidence and time. Organizations should focus on scheduling time monthly, and the LNSCs’ professional confidence should be optimized by extending their intercollegiate meetings with educational sessions."

Title
Hand hygiene compliance in home-based nursing care: Insights from an unobtrusive observational study.
Rationale 
Every month, 270,000 people in the Netherlands receive home-based nursing care (HBNC). Patients receiving HBNC are at a high risk for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Hand hygiene is the most important measure to prevent HAIs. However, literature on HAIs and hand hygiene compliance in HBNC is scarce. 
Objective
The primary objective of this research is to examine hand hygiene performance (i.e. compliance and technique) in HBNC. Secondary objectives are compliance with personal hygiene and handling of mobile devices with regards to hygiene.
Methods
With a quantitative, cross-sectional study design data were collected at a Dutch HBNC organization. Nurses and professional caregivers were observed directly and unobtrusively. Compliance data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Pearson’s chi-square tests were performed to assess possible differences between the overall compliance and the compliance rates of the five hand hygiene moments and between the overall compliance and the professional statuses. A possible relation between hand hygiene compliance and compliance with personal hygiene was explored using correlation measures. 
Results
Twenty-two healthcare workers were observed visiting 134 patients. This resulted in 443 hand hygiene opportunities. Hand hygiene compliance for individual participants varied from 10.0% to 63.0%, with an overall compliance of 35.0%. When technique was added, this compliance rate decreased to 13.1%. The compliance with personal hygiene (81.8%) and correct use of devices (27.5%) differed strikingly.
Conclusion and recommendations
Hand hygiene was performed correctly in only 13.1% of 443 opportunities. The results of this study are a first insight into hand hygiene compliance in HBNC in the Netherlands and should be repeated at multiple Dutch HBNC organizations. These results could help in developing a hand hygiene improvement intervention for the HBNC setting."

Background: Despite a significant increase in older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and the advantages of peritoneal dialysis (PD), only 14% of older Dutch patients with dialysis use PD. This treatment requires a high level of self-management. Because older patients with ESRD have an increased risk of disease-related comorbidities and complaints, there are doubts about their self-management performance. It is, therefore, essential to gain more insight into the self-management experiences and needs of older patients with PD.
Aim: To explore the daily self-management experiences in peritoneal-dialysis of elderly patients with ESRD.
Method: A qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews was conducted. The interviews were guided by a topic list based on the theoretical framework of everyday self-management strategies. For recruiting participants, purposeful sampling is used, with inclusion criteria: 65 years of age or older, receiving PD over two months, and not dependent on PD home care. Data analysis took place through thematic analysis.
Results: Twelve participants were interviewed, eight men and four women aged 67 to 85 years. The PD experience median was 18 months. Six PD self-management themes emerged from these interviews; 1. Emotional needs, 2. Daily life with PD, 3.Health and prevention, 4.Managing PD-treatment, 5. Decision making and training, and 6.Self-management support.
Conclusion: In this study, participants have positive PD self-management experiences into their daily lives. Acceptance of health-state was supportive in coping with impairments and concerns and shared decision making increased their point of view about governing their lives. The main benefit in PD was to live an independent life. However, there must be an awareness of an increased burden in the event of further physical decline, and assisted PD should be considered.
Recommendations: Further research is recommended on how to support older PD-patients within accepting their impairment and expressing their needs, and when assisted-PD is indicated.

Titel: Peritoneale Dialyse; zelfmanagement ervaringen in het dagelijkse leven van de oudere patiënt met eindstadium nierfalen.

Achtergrond: Ondanks een toename van het aantal oudere patiënten met eindstadium nierfalen en de voordelen van peritoneale dialyse (PD), wordt deze behandeling in maar 14 % van de oudere Nederlandse dialysepatiënten toegepast. PD vereist een hoge mate van zelfmanagement en organisatie binnen het dagelijks leven. Oudere patiënten met eindstadium nierfalen hebben een hoger risico op kwetsbaarheid en de aanwezigheid van co-mobiliteiten, hierdoor zijn er twijfels over een juiste PD-zelf-management. Het is daarom noodzakelijk om meer inzicht te krijgen in de zelfmanagement-ervaringen van ouderen met PD. 
Doelstelling: Het exploreren van de dagelijkse zelfmanagement ervaringen in de uitvoering van PD bij ouderen.
Methode:  Een kwalitatieve studie is uitgevoerd door semigestructureerde interviews met een topiclijst. De interviewtopics zijn gebaseerd op het dagelijkse zelfmanagement strategieën raamwerk (TEDSS). Met een doelgerichte steekproef werden oudere patiënten met minimaal twee maanden PD-ervaring geworven voor de studie. De data werd geanalyseerd door een thematische analyse.
Resultaten: Acht mannen en vier vrouwen in de leeftijd van 67 tot 85 jaar werden geïnterviewd. De mediaan van de PD-ervaring was 18 maanden. Vanuit deze interviews zijn zes PD zelfmanagement thema’s gevonden: (1) Emotionele behoeften, (2) Dagelijks leven met PD, (3) Gezondheid en preventie, (4) PD behandeling, (5) Besluitvorming en competentie en (6) Ondersteuning van zelfmanagement.
Conclusie: Oudere PD patiënten hebben positieve zelfmanagement ervaringen in de organisatie van PD in het dagelijks leven. Acceptatie was ondersteunend in de coping van fysieke beperkingen en de gezamenlijke besluitvorming verhoogde de ervaren autonomie. Het voordeel van PD was het gevoel van onafhankelijkheid. Hierbij moet wel rekening worden gehouden met een toenemende belasting in zelfzorg bij verdere fysieke achteruitgang, en zou geassisteerde-PD tijdig moeten worden overwogen.
Aanbevelingen: Verder onderzoek wordt aanbevolen naar strategieën om oudere PD-patiënten te ondersteunen in het acceptatie proces, uiten van hun behoeften, en wanneer geassisteerde-PD moet worden overwogen."

Implementation of the quality standard Pressure Ulcer in primary care: a quantitative study of determinants influencing actual use

Background: Pressure Ulcers affect health-related quality of life in patients. In 56.6% of cases, no preventive measures were taken in risk patients in primary care. To support healthcare professionals in providing the best possible care to patients in Pressure Ulcers, professionals developed the quality standard Pressure Ulcer, which will be implemented in the Netherlands.
Aim: This study identified determinants that influence healthcare professionals in the actual use of the quality standard Pressure Ulcer in Dutch primary care.
Method: This cross-sectional study used a survey of determinants of the quality standard and applicability of recommendations, which were then measured with Likert-scales. Healthcare professionals were invited through snowball sampling. Descriptive statistics were used.
Results: Answers of 98 participants were analysed. Healthcare professionals identified 12 barriers. The most-often identified barriers were a lack of formal agreement about use of the quality standard and that not all organizations appointed someone to coordinate the implementation. Healthcare professionals identified 15 facilitators. The most identified facilitators were that healthcare professionals stated the use of the quality standard is part of their job, and the motivation to comply the colleagues and patients in using the quality standard.
Three recommendations were applicable. Healthcare professionals were divided in their opinion of six recommendations, related to the classification system, change of body position, and performance of a skin assessment.
Conclusion and implication of key findings: Focus implementation strategies mainly on organizational factors since most identified barriers were related tot hat. Most of the recommendations were applicable. Enrichment of knowledge is needed about the NPUAP/EPUAP classification system and assessment tools and materials, as well as an adjustment in the recommendation about changing the body position of the patient to make it practicable feasible.
 
NEDERLANDSE SAMENVATTING
Implementatie van de kwaliteitsstandaard Decubitus in de eerstelijnszorg: een kwantitatief onderzoek naar beïnvloedende factoren

Achtergrondinformatie: Decubitus beïnvloedt het gezondheidsgerelateerde kwaliteit van leven. In 56.6% van de gevallen worden geen preventieve interventies ingezet bij patiënten in de eerstelijnszorg met een risico op decubitus. Om zorgprofessionals te ondersteunen in het leveren van de beste mogelijk zorg voor de patiënt is de kwaliteitsstandaard decubitus ontwikkeld, welke in zomer 2020 in Nederland geïmplementeerd wordt.
Onderzoeksdoel: Dit onderzoek richt zich op het identificeren van determinanten die zorgprofessionals ervaren in het gebruik van de kwaliteitsstandaard decubitus in eerstelijnszorg in Nederland.
Methode: Dit cross-sectionele onderzoek bestaat uit een online vragenlijst over determinanten van de kwaliteitsstandaard en de toepasbaarheid van de aanbevelingen uit de kwaliteitsstandaard, gemeten met Likert-schalen. Zorgprofessionals zijn uitgenodigd via de sneeuwbalmethode. Beschrijvende statistiek is toegepast, ondersteunt door Statistical Package for the Social Science Statistics.
Resultaten: In totaal zijn de antwoorden van 98 zorgprofessionals geanalyseerd. De zorgprofessionals identificeerde 12 belemmerende factoren, waarvan een gebrek aan formele afspraken over het gebruik van de kwaliteitsstandaard en niet alle organisaties hebben iemand aangewezen voor het coördineren van de implementatie het vaakst voorkwamen. Zorgprofessionals identificeerde 15 bevorderende factoren. De vaakst voorkomende zijn dat zij het tot hun functie vinden horen om de kwaliteitsstandaard te gebruiken en mening van collega’s en patiënten in het gebruik wordt belangrijk geacht.
De meeste aanbevelingen zijn toepasbaar volgens de zorgprofessionals. De meningen over toepasbaarheid zijn verdeeld als het gaat over het classificatiesysteem, wisselligging en de huidbeoordeling.
Conclusie en aanbevelingen: Focus de implementatiestrategieën op de organisatorische factoren omdat deze factoren het vaakst werden geïdentificeerd als barrières.

Title: Is resilience associated with self-care? A cross-sectional study in patients with Cystic Fibrosis.
Background: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening progressive genetic disease. Supporting and empowering patients in performing self-care, prevents exacerbations,  improves well-being and decreases morbidity and mortality. The daily need to cope with CF and its adversities, might result in a strong sense of resilience among patients, but the association with self-care is unknown.
Aim: The aim is to explore the association between resilience and self-care in patients with CF, aged 18 years or older.
Method: A quantitative, cross-sectional study design was used. The study was conducted in the Netherlands, at the outpatient clinic of a tertiary (University) hospital. Data was collected between January 2020 – March 2020, with the use of questionnaires. The Resilience Evaluation Scale (RES) and the Self-Care of Chronic Illness Inventory (SC-CII) were used. Multiple regression analysis was used to quantify the association between resilience and self-care. Possible confounders were age, gender, education level, marital status, ppFEV1 and depression.
Results: 46 patients consented to participate and 40 patients returned the questionnaires. Mean age was 29 years (range 18-56) and 27 were female. Resilience was not significantly associated with the three self-care behaviours in univariate and multiple regression analysis (p ≥ .05). After correcting for confounders, gender (β = -.54) and negative screening for depression (β = .36) were statistically significant associated with self-care monitoring and low education (β = .63) with self-care maintenance.   
Conclusion: The results of our study indicate that in patients with CF, resilience is not associated with self-care.
Recommendations: This research is a start in identifying how resilience and self-care are associated. This association should be further researched, where self-care should be clearly defined and lack of continuity in self-care research should be prevented. 

Nederlandse samenvatting.
Titel: Is veerkracht geassocieerd met zelfzorg? Een cross-sectioneel onderzoek bij patiënten met Cystische Fibrose.
Achtergrond: Cystische Fibrose (CF) is een levensbedreigende, progressieve, genetische ziekte. Met het ondersteunen van patiënten in het uitvoeren van zelfzorg, kunnen exacerbaties voorkomen worden, welzijn verhoogd en morbiditeit en mortaliteit verlaagd. Het dagelijks omgaan met CF en bijbehorende tegenslagen, kunnen zorgen voor verhoogde veerkracht. Echter, de associatie met zelfzorg is niet bekend. 
Doel: Het doel is om de associatie te exploreren tussen veerkracht en zelfzorg bij patiënten met CF van 18 jaar of ouder. 
Methode: Een kwantitatief, cross-sectioneel design is gebruikt. Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd in een Nederlands tertiair (universitair) ziekenhuis, op de polikliniek. Dataverzameling vond plaats tussen januari 2020 - maart 2020, met gebruik van vragenlijsten. De ‘Resilience Evaluation Scale’ (RES) en de ‘Self-Care of Chronic Illness Inventory’ (SC-CII) werden gebruikt. Multipele regressie analyse werd gebruikt om de associatie tussen veerkracht en zelfzorg te kwantificeren. Mogelijke confounders waren leeftijd, geslacht, educatie niveau, burgerlijke status, ppFEV1 en depressie.
Resultaten: 46 patiënten ondertekenden het toestemmingsformulier, 40 patiënten retourneerden de vragenlijst. De gemiddelde leeftijd was 29 jaar (range 18-56) en 27 waren vrouw. Veerkracht was niet significant geassocieerd met alle drie de zelfzorg gedragingen in de univariate en multivariate regressie analyse (p ≥ .05). Na corrigeren voor confounders, waren geslacht (β = -.54) en negatieve screening op depressie (β = .36) statistisch significant geassocieerd met zelfzorg-monitoring en lage educatie (β = .63) met zelfzorg-behoud.
Conclusie: De resultaten van deze studie laten zien dat bij patiënten met CF veerkracht niet geassocieerd is met zelfzorg. 
Aanbevelingen: Dit onderzoek is een start in het identificeren hoe veerkracht en zelfzorg geassocieerd zijn. Het wordt aanbevolen deze associatie verder te onderzoeken, waarbij zelfzorg duidelijk gedefinieerd wordt en gebrek in continuïteit in zelfzorg onderzoek voorkomen wordt."

Title: Concurrent validity of the Qmentum pressure ulcer quick scan in measuring nurse’s knowlegde: a clinimetric study 
Background: Prevalence of pressure ulcers (PU) is used as a quality indicator in healthcare. The Netherlands Institute for Accreditation in Healthcare (NIAZ) is cooperating with the Canadian international accreditation program Qmentum, since 2014. Qmentum is the most renowned accreditation program in all-healthcare settings around the world and is characterized with extensive employee engagement of the healthcare organization. The first step of the accreditation cycle is the Qmentum self-assessment, to assess PU knowledge and provides an overview of the current institutional educational level. Qmentum self-assessment consists four questions. The gold standard to assess nurses PU knowledge is the Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Assessment Tool (PUKAT) and exist of 26 questions. Currently, the Qmentum tool lacks rigours clinimetric testing. 
Aim: The objective is to determine the concurrent validity of the Qmentum self-assessment compared with the PUKAT as gold standard.
Method: 90 ICU nurses filled out the Qmentum self-assessment questionnaire and PUKAT in a single session using the LimeSurvey tool. Chi square test was used to compare the PUKAT and Qmentum. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis and sensitivity and specificity analysis was conducted to assess concurrent validity.
Results: Chi Square test showed no statistical significance between the Qmentum self-assessment and PUKAT for the measurement of concurrent validity (p= 0.28). Qmentum has shown poor concurrent validity (AUC= 0.54). The sensitivity was 35.1%, the specificity was 94.3%.
Conclusion: Qmentum self-assessment showed poor concurrent validity against the gold standard PUKAT. The exact measurement domain of the Qmentum self-assessment stays unclear. 
Recommendations: Qmentum self-assessment should not be considered as a quick brief knowledge PU instrument. 
 
NEDERLANDE SAMENVATTING

Titel: Concurrent validiteit van de Qmentum decubitus quickscan in het meten van kennis bij verpleegkundigen: een klinimetrische studie.  
Achtergrond: Prevalentie van decubitus wordt gebruikt als kwaliteitsindicator in de gezondheidszorg. Het Nederlands Instituut voor Accreditatie in de Gezondheidszorg (NIAZ) werkt sinds 2014 samen met het Canadese internationale accreditatieprogramma Qmentum. Qmentum is het meest gerenommeerde accreditatieprogramma in alle zorginstituten over de wereld en wordt gekenmerkt door uitgebreide medewerkersbetrokkenheid van de zorgorganisatie. De eerste stap van de accreditatiecyclus is de Qmentum-zelfbeoordeling, om kennis over decubitus te beoordelen en geeft een overzicht van het huidige institutionele kennisniveau. Qmentum-zelfbeoordeling bestaat uit vier vragen. De gouden standaard om kennis over decubitus van verpleegkundigen te beoordelen is de Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Assessment Tool (PUKAT) en bestaat uit 26 vragen. Momenteel ontbreekt het de Qmentum-tool aan rigoureuze klinimetrische tests.
Doel: Het doel is om concurrent validiteit van de Qmentum-zelfbeoordeling te bepalen in vergelijking met de PUKAT als gouden standaard.
Methode: 90 IC-verpleegkundigen vulden de Qmentum-zelfbeoordeling en PUKAT in één sessie in met behulp van de LimeSurvey, een online vragenlijsten tool. Chi-kwadraattest werd gebruikt om de PUKAT en Qmentum te vergelijken. Daarnaast werd een curve analyse van de receiver operating characteristics (ROC) en sensitiviteit- en specificiteitsanalyse uitgevoerd om gelijktijdige validiteit te beoordelen.
Resultaten: Chi-kwadraattest toonde geen statistische significantie tussen de Qmentum-zelfbeoordeling en PUKAT voor het meten van de concurrent validiteit (p = 0,28). Qmentum heeft een slechte validiteit (AUC = 0,54). De sensitiviteit was 35,1%, de specificiteit was 94,3%.
Conclusie: De Qmentum-zelfbeoordeling toonde een slechte concurrente validiteit tegen de gouden standaard PUKAT. Het exacte meetdomein van de Qmentum-zelfbeoordeling blijft onduidelijk.
Aanbevelingen: Qmentum-zelfbeoordeling kan niet worden beschouwd als een snel beknopt decubitus kennisinstrument."
Understanding the use of diagnostic imaging for patients with low back pain in the Emergency Department: a qualitative study,"['Blokzijl, J.']","['Traeger, A.C.']",2020-09-07T18:00:35Z,en,"['Low back pain, Emergency Department, Imaging, Overuse']",Fysiotherapiewetenschap,"Background: Overuse of lumbar imaging in the Emergency Department is a well-recognised health care challenge. No intervention to date has shown robust reductions in overuse. For an intervention aimed at reducing imaging to be effective, insight into how both patients and clinicians view imaging tests is essential.
Aim: The aim for this research is to explore patients’ and clinicians’ views on the use of imaging in the Emergency Department and factors that might influence overuse of imaging.
Methods: We recruited participants from three hospitals in Sydney, Australia. We performed focus groups and/or interviews with 14 patients and 12 clinicians. Sessions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. We analysed the data using the framework analysis method within a team of four researchers with backgrounds in public health, sociology, musculoskeletal conditions, and low value care. 
Results: Patients felt that the decision about imaging is made by the ED clinician, and they are not involved in this process. Potential drivers of overuse, from a patient’s perspective, were strong expectations of imaging results, a reluctance to delay of diagnostic imaging, and external parties such as insurance companies requiring imaging. Clinicians stated that patient pressure and the inability to manage this pressure in busy emergency care setting (e.g. lack of time to develop a relationship with patients and to explain the reasons to avoid imaging) could drive overuse. Potential protective factors against overuse of imaging included providing patients with a good explanation and performing a thorough examination, and collaborative approaches to care involving good communication within ED and aligning management with primary care. 
Conclusion and key findings: We found several factors that could drive overuse of imaging in emergency care setting. Solutions to reduce overuse of imaging in the ED should include: 1) training and support to assist clinicians to provide an adequate and well explained assessment for low back pain, 2) tools to involve patients in decisions about imaging, and 3) care pathways and communication strategies that encourage collaborative approaches to care."
"Social isolation in patients hospitalized for a surgery, does it matter?","['Wind, A.J. van der']","['Eskes, A.M.']",2020-09-07T18:00:35Z,en_US,"['Cohort studies, social isolation, surgery, hospital readmission, length of stay']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Patients undergoing surgery often experience postoperative complications, sometimes leading to unplanned readmissions or prolonged hospital stay. Physical and mental factors have been identified as predictors for postoperative complications, however, the impact of social isolation during hospital admission on clinical outcomes after surgery has not yet been explored. 
Aim: To explore the relationship between inpatient social isolation and unplanned readmissions within 90 days after surgery. Secondary objectives were to evaluate relationships between social isolation and mortality, initial and total hospital length of stay (LOS), and related factors to social isolation.
Methods: Patients undergoing vascular, gastro-intestinal, urological, trauma or orthopaedic surgery in a Dutch tertiary hospital were included in this cohort study. Social isolation was measured during hospitalization using the Friendship Scale (FS). Logistic and multivariable linear regression models, adjusted for confounders using propensity scores, were used to explore relationships.
Results: In total, 118 patients were included. Almost half (48.3%) underwent (oncological) gastro-intestinal surgery. 29 patients (24.6%) were readmitted at least once and 3 patients (2.5%) died. Median FS score was 3 out of 21 (IQR = 1; 5). No significant relationships were observed between social isolation and unplanned readmission (p = .478), initial and total LOS (p = .657; p .601, respectively). Living with others, but without partner, and less quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were significantly related to a higher degree of social isolation (p =.009, p = .002, respectively). 
Conclusion and implications of key findings: No relationships were found between inpatient social isolation and unplanned readmissions, initial or total LOS. Living with others, but without partner, and less QALYs were related to a higher sense of social isolation. Related to other studies, it remains important to focus in clinical practice on patients’ personal and social factors."
Exploring the needs and possible solutions to improve the formal assessment of district nurses in home care: A qualitative study,"['Bovenkamp, B. van de']","['Bleijenberg, N.']",2020-09-07T18:00:34Z,en,"['Home care [MeSH term], district nurse, formal assessments, needs, solutions.']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Title: Exploring the needs and possible solutions to improve the formal assessments of district 
nurses in home care: a qualitative study. 
Background: Home care differs widely across Europe in financing and care allocation. In the Netherlands, district nurses are authorised in care allocation, called formal assessment. In formal assessments, the district nurse determines the care demand based on the needs of the patient. However, practice variation occurs in formal assessments, meaning there are differences in care allocation for comparable patients. Practice variation reduces quality of care. Since district nurses perform formals assessments, it is important to gain insight into the needs and possible solutions of district nurses to improve the quality of formal assessments. 
Aim: The aim was to explore the needs and possible solutions of district nurses to improve the quality of the formal assessment to determine the care needs of patients in home care. 
Method: An explorative study was conducted. District nurses were purposefully sampled. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in March and April 2020. Data was thematically analysed according to Braun and Clarke.
Results: Two main themes emerged after interviewing district nurses (n=12): district nurses needs for quality and uniformity improvement, and district nurses’ preconditions for quality and uniformity improvement. District nurses perceived learning from and with each other and education as important needs for district nurses to improve the quality and uniformity of formal assessments. District nurses defined preconditions to improve the quality of formal assessments by: retaining autonomy, more time, and structure and facilities. 
Conclusion: This study provided insight regarding the needs and possible solutions of district nurses to improve the quality of formal assessments in home care. District nurses needs to reduce practice variation could be further explored considering that practice variation plays an important role in the quality of formal assessments."

Title: Exploring the home health care nursing work environment and the relation to nurse-reported patient outcomes.
Background: A healthy work environment for home health care (HHC) nurses is important to maintain quality of care and attract and retain nurses, in a situation of growing need for HHC and nurse shortage. Most research is performed in hospital setting, therefore further research is needed to explore the nursing work environment in HHC setting. 
Aims: Determine the importance and presence of elements of work environment in current practice as indicated by HHC nurses. Secondary aim was to explore the association between healthy work environment and different job- and nurse-reported patient outcomes.
Method: A cross-sectional online survey study was conducted among Dutch HHC nurses. The survey was developed, using fifteen elements of work environment as described in literature. Descriptive statistics determined rankings of (1) important elements and (2) present elements. Associations between healthy work environment and the job outcomes and nurse reported patient outcomes were analysed using univariate regression.  
Results: Fifty-nine nurses participated. ‘Safe and healthy work environment’ and ‘working with clinically competent peers’ were most important elements. ‘Patient-centered culture’ and ‘clinical autonomy’ were most present. A healthy work environment was positively associated with ‘patient safety’ (Regression coefficient B=0.138 (Confidence interval CI 0.05:0.22)), ‘time available to coordinate care’ (B=0.198 (CI 0.07:0.33)), ‘overall quality of care’ (B=0.147 (CI 0.04:0.25)), ‘work satisfaction’ (B=0.175 CI (0.08:0.28)) and ‘satisfaction on work environment’ (B=0.187 (CI 0.07:0.30)). ‘Time available for the patient’ (B=0.04 (CI 0.07:0.14)) was not significantly associated.
Conclusion: HHC nurses considered all elements important, however not all elements were present in practice. A healthy work environment positively influences the job- and patient outcomes. 
Recommendations: implementing all elements of work environment in HHC and development of a validated instrument.

Samenvatting
Titel: Exploreren van de werkomgeving en de relatie met verpleegkundig gerapporteerde patiënt uitkomsten in de wijkverpleging.
Achtergrond: Een gezonde werkomgeving voor verpleegkundigen in de wijkverpleging is belangrijk om de kwaliteit van zorg te waarborgen en verpleegkundigen te boeien en te binden. Zeker in de situatie van groeiende vraag naar wijkverpleging en het tekort aan verpleegkundigen. Onderzoek hiernaar is veelal gedaan in ziekenhuissetting, daardoor is verder onderzoek naar de werkomgeving en associatie met werk- en patiënt uitkomsten in de wijkverpleging nodig.  
Doel: Bepalen welke elementen verpleegkundigen aangeven als belangrijk en als aanwezig. Tweede doel is exploreren van de associatie tussen de gezonde werkomgeving en verschillende werkuitkomsten en verpleegkundig gerapporteerde patiënt uitkomsten. 
Methode: Een cross sectionele, online vragenlijst studie is uitgevoerd, onder Nederlandse verpleegkundigen in de wijkverpleging. De vragenlijst is samengesteld met behulp van vijftien elementen van werkomgeving uit de literatuur. Beschrijvende statistiek resulteert in rangordes van (1) belangrijke elementen en (2) aanwezigheid van elementen. De associatie tussen gezonde werkomgeving en de werk uitkomsten en verpleegkundig gerapporteerde patiënt uitkomsten is geanalyseerd met behulp van enkelvoudige regressie. 
Resultaten: Negenenvijftig verpleegkundigen participeerden. De belangrijkste elementen waren ‘Veilig en gezonde werkomgeving’ en ‘werken met vakbekwame collega’s’. ‘Patiënt staat centraal’, en ‘Autonomie’ waren het meest aanwezig. Gezonde werkomgeving was positief geassocieerd met ‘patiënt veiligheid’ (Regressie coëfficiënt B=0.138 (Betrouwbaarheid Interval BI 0.05:0.22)), ‘Tijd voor coördineren van zorg’ (B=0.198 (BI 0.07:0.33)), ‘kwaliteit van zorg’ (B=0.147 (BI 0.04:0.25)), ‘werkplezier’ (B=0.175 BI (0.08:0.28)) en ‘werktevredenheid’ (B=0.187 (BI 0.07:0.30)). ‘Tijd gedurende zorgmoment’ (B=0.04 (BI -0.07:0.14)) was niet significant geassocieerd. 
Conclusie: Alle elementen zijn belangrijk bevonden door de verpleegkundigen in de wijkverpleging, maar niet alle elementen waren aanwezig. Een gezonde werkomgeving beïnvloed de werk- en patiënt uitkomsten positief.  
Aanbeveling: Implementeren van alle elementen van de werkomgeving in de wijkverpleging en een gevalideerd meetinstrument hiervoor ontwikkelen."

Society is facing an enormous growth in the number of older adults with mobility problems related to activities of daily living. For transition from “care to illness to healthy behavior” we need professionals who empower patients to take responsibility for their own health.
Aim: To identify which barriers and facilitators physical therapists experienced during the implementation of the Coach2Move physical therapy for the management of community-dwelling older adults (>=70 years) with mobility problems and/or physically inactive lifestyles in a pragmatic, real-world setting. 
Method: A qualitative study investigated the barriers and facilitators of the implementation of Coach2Move in sixteen various practices. Twelve random semi-structured interviews (30-90 minutes) were held with five physical therapists (PT) and seven physical therapists specialized in geriatrics (PTG). An interview protocol was developed. Each interview was audio¬taped and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using a structured thematic approach ATLAS.ti.
Results: The participating PTs and PTGs identified several barriers and facilitators regarding to the implementation of the Coach2Move program. Four themes emerged from these barriers and facilitators during data analysis. First, we found that the therapists in the trial struggled with applying the eligibility criteria. Especially people who had cognitive impairments or were less motivated were erroneously excluded. Second, the therapists positively experienced the Coach2Move training, despite the attendees had different levels of professional degrees. More emphasis could had been put on the eligibility criteria. Third, for a sustainable implementation of Coach2Move, all therapists deemed structural reimbursement of Coach2Move program by all health insurers as crucial and there has to be a continuous influx of new patients. Fourth and final, we found that the research context influenced the implementation of Coach2Move, both negatively as well as positively. 
Conclusion and key findings: Barriers and facilitators were identified in this study such as reimbursement by health insurance companies and the use of one EPD to make Coach2Move user-friendly. Before implementing Coach2Move into the field those barriers and facilitators should be taken into account."
Feasibility of the nurse nutrition intervention ‘Nurses For Food’ to improve nutritional intake in hospitalized patients,"['Henderikx, S.']","['Rieckert, A.']",2020-09-07T18:00:41Z,en,"['Feasibility Studies, Hospitals, Nurses, Patient Participation, nutrition intervention']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Feasibility of ‘Nurses For Food’ to improve nutritional intake
Background: An evidence-based nurse nutrition intervention ‘Nurses for Food’ (NFF) focussed on the nurse and the patient, has been developed to improve nutritional care and patient empowerment in hospitals. For nurses, the included elements of intervention consisted of an e-learning, work instructions, start- and follow-up meetings, and an infographic. For the patients, a Self-Evaluation of Food Intake (SEFI)® card and an infographic were provided. Here, the feasibility of NFF was evaluated.
Aim: To evaluate the feasibility of a nurse nutrition intervention ‘NFF’ in the hospital setting regarding reach and recruitment, dose delivered, fidelity of delivery, fidelity of treatment, acceptability of nurses and patients with (a risk for) malnutrition.
Method: A multi-centred quantitative feasibility study was performed wherein NFF was delivered in addition to usual care during the intervention period of five months.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this feasibility study was temporarily paused. An alternative  analysis of data was performed based on the research question ‘What is the motivation and self-reported knowledge regarding nutritional care from nurses and nurse assistants in an academic hospital in the period before implementation of the NFF study?’ An online survey that focused on different aspects of nutritional care in hospitals was sent to 175 nurses and nurse assistants working in various wards in an academic hospital. When ‘nurses’ are appointed in this article, this also includes nurse assistants.

Results The survey was completed by 54 nurses (response rate 31%). Regarding the motivation in nutritional care, 84% of nurses indicated that nutritional care is important in their daily work, while a majority (67%) felt they often lack time to provide nutritional care. Additionally, 48% of respondents felt that responsibilities of nurses in nutritional care were unclear. The self-reported knowledge regarding nutritional care is indicated with a median of 7 on a 10-point scale by the respondents.
Conclusions Nurses have an acceptable motivation and a relatively high self-reported knowledge in the treatment of malnourished patients. Yet, malnutrition is not considered as a priority among other duties.
Recommendations A nurse nutrition intervention with a context-oriented implementation strategy that focuses on nurses’ behaviour in nutritional care is essential to optimize treatment of malnourished patients and to ensure that nutrition is an important part of the nursing function."
Evaluation of the (modified) John Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility scale in surgical patients: a retrospective cohort study,"['Boerrigter, J.L.']","['Eskes, A.M.', 'de Man, J.M.']",2020-09-07T18:00:40Z,en,"['early ambulation [MESH], hospitalization [MESH], postoperative period [MESH], retrospective cohort, surgical patients.']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: The John Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility (JH-HLM) scale is developed to promote early mobility, however, in daily practice a ceiling effect in postoperative care is experienced. This study aimed to investigate whether the experienced ceiling effect of the JH-HLM scale actually exists and to evaluate if a modified version, the AMsterdam UMC Extension of the JOhn HOpkins Highest Level of mObility (AMEXO) scale is more sensitive to detect changes in mobility in hospitalized surgical patients.
Method: All patients who underwent gastrointestinal surgery were included and measured with the JH-HLM scale or AMEXO scale in two different periods. Primary outcomes were the percentage of patients with the highest possible mobility score on the first postoperative day and the percentage of patients who showed a change in mobility score between the first three consecutive postoperative days. 
Results: In total, 373 patients were included (JH-HLM; n=135; AMEXO; n=238). On the first postoperative day, 61 (45.2%) patients scored the highest possible mobility score on the JH-HLM scale compared to 4 (1.7%) patients using the AMEXO scale (p-value &lt; 0.001). During the first three consecutive postoperative days, 88 (65.2%) patients showed a change in mobility score with the JH-HLM scale compared to 225 (94.5%) patients with the AMEXO scale (p-value &lt; 0.001).
Conclusion and implications of key findings: Almost half of the patients scored the highest possible mobility score when using the JH-HLM scale which indicates a ceiling effect. The AMEXO scale appeared to be more sensitive to detect changes in mobility in hospitalized surgical patients and is therefore recommended instead of the JH-HLM scale. Future research should focus on how healthcare professionals can use the AMEXO scale to involve surgical patients to improve mobilization during hospital admission."
Usability and usage of an online eHealth module concerning dental hygiene for patients with bipolar disorder. A cross-sectional study.,"['Velde, D. de']","['Goossens, P.J.J.']",2020-09-07T18:00:40Z,en,"['usability, bipolar disorder, oral health, dental hygiene, eHealth']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Title: Usability and usage of an online eHealth module concerning dental hygiene for patients with bipolar disorder. A cross-sectional study.
Background: Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder with a life-time prevalence of 1.3% that is the sixth leading cause of disability worldwide. It causes recurrent episodes of depression and (hypo)mania, separated by intervals of normal mood. Patients with bipolar disorder have an increased risk for dental problems, which can be caused by symptoms of the disorder or the psychopharmaceuticals they use. Educating patients with bipolar disorder on oral care is essential. In general, eHealth interventions are accessible, convenient and cost-effective. However, uncertainty remains about whether emerging eHealth interventions are suitable for reaching individuals with serious mental illnesses including bipolar disorder. In 2018, an eHealth module concerning education of dental health care was developed for patients with mental disorders. The module is currently in its pilot phase. 
Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usability and usage of the online eHealth module ‘Healthy Teeth’ for patients with bipolar disorder using psychopharmaceuticals. 
Method: The study has a cross-sectional design. Questionnaires were obtained among adult patients with bipolar disorder using psychopharmaceuticals, in treatment by a Dutch mental health care organisation. Log data of the module was collected.
Results: The module scores above average on usability (median=85.0, ICR=12.5). The actual usage of the module is low; 26 respondents completed the module. The time patients took to complete the module varied widely; from 6 minutes to 20 days.
Conclusion: This study suggests that the module ‘Healthy Teeth’ is usable for patients with bipolar disorder using psychopharmaceuticals. However, the actual usage of the module was low. 
Recommendations: To increase the usage of the module there is a need to raise awareness amongst practitioners and patients on the benefits of the module and eHealth (interventions) in general."

Data of patients receiving home care pre-introduction of PH (2018) was compared to patients receiving home care post-introduction of PH (2020). Routinely collected health data was used and compared using a Mann-Whitney U test.
Results: In total, 352 patients, 176 patients per group, were included. Univariate analysis showed a significant difference in the received amount of home care (p=0.005). The median was significantly lower in the PH group (176.25, IQR=111.7-287.9) compared to the no-PH group (180.67, IQR=83.8-248.7). In addition, significant difference were observed in type and number of nursing diagnoses.
Conclusion and recommendation: Patients in PH group received a lower amount of home care compared to patients in the no-PH group. In addition, a lower number and type of nursing diagnoses were observed by home care patients in the PH group compared to the no-PH group. Keeping home care affordable, more research focused on the actual effects of PH in daily practice is needed, to be of value of the increasing demands of home care worldwide."
Transfer of patient information in relation to person-centred care: A qualitative study from the perspective of nursing home staff.,"['Poelen, A.M.M.']","['Persoon, A.']",2020-09-07T18:00:39Z,en,"['Person-centred care, transfer of patient information, nursing home staff.']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Person-centred care (PCC) is praised as an effective solution to current challenges like ageing populations, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and the spread of unhealthy lifestyles. The transfer between health care providers is essential for its success. Because of the fact that PCC consists of a person related approach, lots of information concerning an individual patient has to be transferred. It is questionable if the daily practise of transfer of patient information fits with the complexity of PCC. Furthermore, little is known about the perspective of nursing home staff in relation to this crucial transfer of patient information towards PCC.
Aim: This study aims to investigate the transfer of patient information between completing and commencing shifts in relation to PCC from the perspective of nursing home staff. 
Methods: A generic, qualitative study was conducted. An interview guide was used to structure the interviews. Data collection and thematic analysis took place iteratively.
Results: Nine providers were interviewed. Three main themes emerged from the analysis: knowing the patient, provider’s present knowledge of the patient and transfer of patient information.
Conclusion and implications of key findings: Knowing the patient is a prerequisite to offer PCC. This extent in knowing depends on the providers’ present knowledge about the patient and the content of the transfer of patient information. The needs of the nursing home staff concerning the transfer of patient information, and therewith the possibilities of executing PCC, is shaped by the differences in their present knowledge about the patient. To succeed in an effective transfer and meet the individual wishes from the staff, a clear guideline concerning the transfer and an enhanced usability of the electronic patient record is required."
"The relationship between humor styles and psychological well-being, and the role of social support and age","['Maas, B.']","['Doosje, S.']",2021-08-06T18:00:08Z,en,"['Humor styles, psychological well-being, social support, age.']",Clinical Psychology,"People tend to use humor in four different ways. Two positive humor styles (affiliative and self-enhancing) and two negative humor styles (aggressive and self-defeating). Research repeatedly showed that humor styles are related to psychological well-being. If humor styles and psychological well-being are that strongly associated, next the mechanisms that link humor styles with well-being are interesting. Because of the inherently interpersonal nature of humor, it is thought that social support could be such a mechanism. Also interesting is the exploring of contexts in which humor styles could have a more potent impact on psychological well-being, such as age differences. Research showed that there are age differences in the use of humor styles. This is why the current study will investigate the relationship between humor styles and psychological well-being, the possible mediating role of social support in the relationship between humor styles and well-being, and the possible moderating role of age in the relationships between humor styles, well-being and social support. With the use of questionnaires data was collected. The final sample consisted of 109 participants (M Age = 36.8, SD Age = 17.2), both women (n= 72) and men (n= 37). Next correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis, which also tested mediation and moderation, were used to test the hypotheses. Results showed that affiliative and selfenhancing humor were positively related to psychological well-being, and self-defeating humor was negatively related to psychological well-being. Social support mediated the relationship between self-enhancing and self-defeating humor. Age was only found as a moderator for the relationship between social support and well-being. Longitudinal studies are necessary to investigate causal direction."

In El Salvador zijn twee grote straatbendes actief: Mara Salvatrucha en Barrio Dieciocho (MS-13 en Barrio 18). Deze straatbendes hebben El Salvador een van de gevaarlijkste landen op aarde gemaakt. MS-13 en Barrio 18 zijn ontstaan in Los Angeles en zijn opgericht door Salvadoraanse vluchtelingen. Deze vluchtelingen waren naar de Verenigde Staten gevlucht tijdens de Salvadoraanse burgeroorlog tussen 1979 en 1992. De Verenigde Staten hebben sinds de jaren negentig honderdduizenden van deze vluchtelingen teruggestuurd naar hun thuisland. In El Salvador vonden de bendes de perfecte voedingsbodem om zich uit te breiden. Deze uitbreiding zorgde er in 2003 voor dat de regering van El Salvador het ‘Plan Mano Dura’ onthulde om deze bendes grootschalig aan te pakken. Dit Plan Mano Dura werd na een jaar onwettelijk verklaard door het hooggerechtshof, aangezien het in ging tegen de rechten van de mens. Om de strijd tegen de bendes door te zetten kwam de Salvadoraanse regering in 2006 met het ‘Plan Super Mano Dura’. In dit plan werd het originele plan gecombineerd met grootschalige beeldvorming over de bendes. Deze beeldvorming zal vanuit Foucault bekeken worden."

Other important voices heard are those of John Rawls, Charles Taylor, Joseph Ratzinger and Simone Chambers. The philosophical debate is linked to the case study of the abortion discussion in the Netherlands. This thesis studies what role religion plays in the abortion discussion on three different levels: organizations, media and politics. When arguing against abortion, in what way do Christian pro-life organizations, Christian newspapers and Christian political parties appeal to their religion? For example, religious metaphors, bible references or appeals to religious authorities are studied in this thesis and compared between the three different levels. My own position regarding the philosophical debate concerning what role religion should have in the public sphere is based on Simone Chambers’ theory and on the results of the case study."

The model was developed to simulate particle attachment on a micro-scale to the pore surface of a constricted pore. Fluid mechanics were modeled using the lattice Boltzmann method of fluid simulations, and particles were simulated as smooth body forces acting as an external force within the Lattice Boltzmann equation using the smoothed profile method. DLVO forces were simulated between particles, and between particles and the pore surface. A sensitivity analysis has been performed regarding four different variables influential to DLVO and hydrodynamic interactions that govern particle attachment. The variables analyzed include: particle radius, zeta potential, ionic strength and flow velocity.
   The resulting data of the model has been applied to investigate potential porosity-permeability relations at the micro-scale using attached particles as a proxy for porosity. The resulting profiles have been fitted using a generalized Kozeny-Carman and power law relation. Furthermore, coefficient analysis of said equations has been performed to investigate trends between changes in variables and coefficients. Although the fitted equations provide an adequate fit to the modeled system, further research are recommended to provide conclusive results on the coefficient analysis."

Manyara catchment in Tanzania, little is known about the role of gully erosion
in Lake Manyara catchment. Lake Manyara is a basin with no outflow making it 
vulnerable to local sediment dynamics. The biodiversity is high and the
national park that is located in the Lake Manyara catchment is an important
source of income for the region. A combination of fieldwork and modeling
with SWAT was implemented to study gully erosion in the catchment. The
fieldwork measurements consisted of the inserting erosion pins in and around
the gully heads and channels of two different gully systems and measuring
the growth. Additionally, SWAT was used to model the surface runoff and
sediment yield that is transported into one of the two studied gully systems.
Further, SWAT was also implemented to study a scenario in which the 
agricultural land cover in the area is increased. The measured sediment mobilization
ranged from 0.01 to 1.71 m3 per month. In the modeled catchment an average
sediment yield which ranged from 4.5 to 15.7 t/ha/yr was found.
 For the scenario with increased agricultural land cover, the sediment yield increased 
significantly. The exact amount of sediment that ends up in the lake is unknown,
but the current study provides an indication of the magnitude of sediment

Peter Verstraten stelt dat in Nederlandse romantische komedies vaak een stereotype beeld van homoseksuele mannen neergezet wordt. Daarom is het belangrijk om binnen de sociaalmaatschappelijke context van Nederland te kijken naar de representatie van deze specifieke groep binnen dit genre. 
In dit bachelor eindwerkstuk wordt het verschil in representatie van homoseksualiteit in de Nederlandse romantische komedies CHEZ NOUS (Oliehoek, 2013) en SINGEL 39 (Krom, 2019) onderzocht. Door de twee films met elkaar te vergelijken, wordt onderzocht of er verbetering in representatie heeft plaats gevonden, gelijk aan de stijging in acceptatie van homoseksualiteit in Nederland. Aan de hand van een methode van Dyer worden de iconography of gayness, de dialoog en de manier waarop de homoseksuele personages zijn ingebed in de narratieve structuur in de films geanalyseerd. Zo wordt onderzocht of de homoseksuele personages stereotype worden afgebeeld, hoe de sociale omgevingen in de films tegenover homoseksualiteit staan en wat de functie van de homoseksualiteit van de personages is. Hierbij wordt gebruik gemaakt van Dyer’s theorieën over stereotype en novelistic characters. Ook worden verschillende opvattingen over homoseksualiteit in romantische komedies meegenomen. Volgens Dennis Allen en Debra Moddelmog ligt heteroseksualiteit als norm ten grondslag van het genre, maar het genre blijft ontwikkelen en Kyle Stevens en Claire Hines tonen aan dat er steeds meer ruimte is voor homoseksualiteit. Ook queerness kan een bron van voldoening zijn. 
In SINGEL 39 wordt een haast homonormatieve wereld geschetst, terwijl er in CHEZ NOUS toch nog veel negativiteit rondom homoseksualiteit naar voren komt. In beide films blijkt het lastig om geheel te ontdoen van de heteronormativiteit die in het genre van de romantische komedie heerst en een homoseksueel koppel centraal te zetten."

In dit onderzoek is gekeken naar de verschillen in receptie van propaganda- en promotievideo’s, gericht op een niet-Chinees publiek. Om de mate van promotie en propaganda in een video te bepalen, is er gebruik gemaakt van de promotiecriteria van Van den Hoven en Ying (2020). De verwachting was dat de ontvankelijkheidspositie invloed heeft op de ervaring van promotie of propaganda. Ook was de verwachting dat een vooroordeel over China bepaalt of de boodschap wordt geaccepteerd. Er is gebruik gemaakt van een plus-min methode gecombineerd met een interview. In het interview werden de promotiecriteria, de propaganda- of promotiebeoordeling, waardering en acceptatie van de boodschap behandeld. Er zijn geen duidelijke verschillen gevonden in de recepties tussen de video’s, omdat de promotie- en propagandabeoordelingen uiteenlopend waren. Op basis van deze beoordelingen zijn er indicatoren voor promotie en propaganda gevonden. Overdrevenheid en de ervaring van incorrecte informatie zijn indicatoren voor propaganda. De ervaring van een informatief karakter en oprechtheid zijn indicatoren voor promotie. De afkomst van de personen in de video heeft invloed op de promotie- of propagandaervaring, afhankelijk van de voorkeur van de respondent. Vooroordelen kunnen zorgen voor zowel een promotie- als een propagandaervaring, afhankelijk van de ontvankelijkheidspositie. De ontvankelijkheidspositie bepaalt welke indicatoren ervaren worden."

Vanuit de Kunstmatige Intelligentie is gekeken naar de technologische problematiek bij het ontwerpen van een eerlijk algoritme, om zo inzicht te verschaffen in de oorzaak en daaruit oplossingen af te leiden. Vanuit de Filosofie is er een handelingsperspectief afgeleid uit de morele bezwaren en morele verantwoordelijkheid omtrent algoritmes die discriminatie veroorzaken.

Via verschillende Twitter functies, zoals @reply, @mention en retweeten kunnen beroemdheden en fans elkaar direct aanspreken, waardoor er sprake kan zijn van een echte interactie. In dit onderzoek wordt de online intimiteitsconstructie tussen fans en beroemdheden onder de loep genomen door de Twitter feed van de band twenty one pilots te bestuderen. Tweets over de tijdspanne van een jaar zijn geanalyseerd via een tekstanalyse en gecategoriseerd in de thema’s public recognition & fan maintenance, affiliation, smalle intimiteit en authenticity & sincerity, in navolging van Twitter onderzoek van Marwick & boyd.

Serb forces, under the command of Milošević, committed atrocities against the Kosovar Albanian population. This research focuses on the question of whether these acts of mass violence can be considered genocidal and does so by applying the UN-definition of genocide onto this conflict and by analyzing various primary sources. This definition is split into three parts. First, the victimized group, Kosovar Albanians, is determined and primary sources prove that they were targeted because of their ethnic and national identity. Second, primary sources prove that Serb forces committed their violent acts intentionally with the aim of destroying Kosovar Albanians. Lastly, the acts of violence itself are investigated with the use of primary sources and these acts correspond with the acts of genocidal violence as stated in the UN-definition. The intentional violence committed by Serb forces against the Kosovar Albanian population during the Kosovo War can thus be called genocidal."

The Central Communist government made use of legal, economic and cultural repression with the intention of controlling Soviet society. The central argument in this thesis is that the instigation and intensification of repression was often related to a perceived or present sense of chaos or disorder. The Bolshevik party did not hold a position of unchallenged authority in the early years of the Soviet Union and often acted out of suspicion and paranoia. Social disorder was therefore referred to as a new form of class war, partly because it could jeopardize the power of the communist regime. By analyzing all these aspects of repression, this thesis will provide an answer to the question: How were different forms of repressive policy connected to the social context of the Soviet Union between 1917 and 1941?
After social disorder was appointed the new class war, all individuals seen as threats to social order or the socialist ideal state were attacked with repressive measures. These threats encompassed a wide variety of different groups within Soviet society. Wealthier citizens, members of the old regime, petty thieves, other socialists, ethnic groups, religious believers and political opposers all became victims of the repressive policies. By eliminating these factors from Soviet society, the government hoped to create a unified socialist state that was under their complete control. The use of visual and textual propaganda aided the implementation of such policies. Campaigns were set out to rally support for initiatives such as collectivization or state atheism. The success of these policies was varied and differed depending on region and time. Throughout the years of the early Soviet Union, it does, however, become apparent that both legal and economic repression proved more successful in fulfilling the desired effect of the government than cultural repression. 
By looking more closely at the social context present before the implementation of repressive policies, a connection between the two can be found. Analyzing the reactive nature of repression can help us understand the process of large-scale, top-down repression. In order to conduct this research, several sources and theoretical works of literature were consulted. Memoirs, posters, tables, letters and reports show the motives and results of the different repressive policies. 
This thesis will discuss three different forms of repression using similar patterns. This makes it possible to compare certain aspects of these forms of repression and highlight their similarities and differences. In all chapters the motives, ways of implementation, groups targeted and results are discussed separately. The first chapter will focus on legal repression and the use of the Gulag system as a political tool. The second chapter discusses economic repression by looking at matters such as the planned economy, rationing and collectivization. In the third chapter, cultural repression and the policies of nationalization and Russification will come forward."

This thesis contributes to this body of literature, but takes on a different starting point, as it analyses the potential for inclusive smart cities in the urban peripheries of Bengaluru. Bengaluru is one of the hundred participating cities in India’s Smart City Mission.	 
 	Through quantitative and qualitative socio-spatial analyses on Bengaluru’s infrastructures in its peripheries, along with an actor analysis of the involved governance actors, I have developed a model of the infrastructural configuration for one of Bengaluru’s peripheral regions. Furthermore, this thesis entails a discourse analysis of state, market and civil society actors, on their agendas and practices regarding smart cities, urbanisation and inclusivity. Together, these methodological approaches provide an understanding on the potential of smart city development in respect to the context of the urban peripheries. 	
 	As Bengaluru’s infrastructure is under pressure through massive urbanisation, market and civil society actors take on institutionalised and hybridised functions in the governance of infrastructure. I argue that these processes will only be intensified  and utilised by Bengaluru’s smart city projects, which may have both positive and negative consequences on the infrastructural access  of marginalised groups. How these projects will turn out, is dependent on the State’s normative and ethical considerations and policy decisions. In an effort of critical pragmatism, this thesis provides five instructive pathways for policy makers to ensure inclusive smart city practices, that can prevent or alleviate the marginalisation of infrastructural access."

They have a key role in the regional development, contributing the host economies in a number of ways, including knowledge transfers, increasing diversity, bringing new specialisations, entrepreneurial activities, and improvement of human capital in general. Attracting and retaining highly skilled people from other regions is a crucial policy area for regional development and knowledge-based economies and the Netherlands is among the leading countries in this global competition. Among the home countries of migrants in the Netherlands, Turkey come into the picture as a major origin, with an increasing trend in the last decade. This research explores the perspectives of the recent wave of highly skilled Turkish migrants in the Netherlands from three interrelated dimensions: how and why the highly skilled migrants move from Turkey to the Netherlands, in which conditions they prefer to stay, and how they perceive their contribution to regional economic development. Employing a mixed strategy, primary data from an online survey and semi-structured interviews with 16 migrants and one policymaker have been analysed in this research. Besides other conclusions and policy recommendations, the key findings of this research include that highly skilled Turkish migrants provide an invaluable contribution to the Netherlands, its regional economies, and companies. Although the attraction factors have an effect on their migration to the Netherlands, their decisions primarily result from push factors in the origin. As a result, their retention and sustained contribution also depend on those factors as well as developing an attachment with the cities and integration to the communities, which is highly related with learning Dutch language and positive influences and concerns about public services."

Travel behaviour changes during times of COVID-19: A mixed methods research to the effects of COVID-19 on travel behaviour in the Netherlands,"['Hagoort, A.M.']","['Ettema, D.F.']",2020-10-13T18:00:29Z,en,['travel behaviour changes; COVID-19; coronavirus; perception; knowledge; telecommunication; mixed methods'],Urban and Economic Geography,"This study provides new insights on travel behaviour changes by researching the effects of COVID-19 on travel behaviour in the Netherlands. The main objective of this research is to test to what extent perceived risk, knowledge, and availability of telecommunication influence travel behaviour during times of COVID-19. The research adds to available knowledge about the effects of the spread of a life-threatening contagious disease on travel behaviour. This was done by using mixed methods: the sample consisted of 145 surveys and 10 structured interviews which focused on activities done during the crisis of COVID-19. The analyses show that travel behaviour changed due to COVID-19 as half of the total amount of activities were discontinued. The only type of activity that continued as usual is grocery shopping, while work- and education-related activities mostly continued at a different location. Furthermore, due to the perceived risk of getting the virus, public transport was used less and was often substituted by other modes of transport. To conclude, travel behaviour has changed due to COVID-19 and these changes are due to the perceived risk of the virus and the availability of telecommunication. Compared to the role of perceived risk and telecommunication, knowledge of the virus appears to have less influence on travel behaviour. It should be noted that the majority of the sample is highly educated which could influence the findings of the research when comparing them to other populations. Further research can give more insights on travel behaviour changes during different medical crises or focus on other types of travel behaviour."
Vehicle to Grid in Utrecht: Integrating Electric Vehicles into the Energy System of Utrecht,"['Ven, M.T. van der']","['Ettema, D.F.']",2020-10-13T18:00:30Z,en,['V2G'],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"This research concerns exploring vehicle to grid (V2G) charging in Utrecht. There are several challenges ahead in the field of energy infrastructure, mobility, energy stability and global warming. V2G could be seen as part of the solution to relieve the stress on these subjects. V2G requires special charging stations, participating electric vehicles and when organized correctly, it would resolve in a series of benefits. But if the municipality of Utrecht would be installing V2G charging stations in the near future, where would they be placed? To find an answer to this problem, this research made use of different methods. An extensive literature review was conducted to understand what V2G is. Next to that a spatial data research was conducted using an MCA as method. This resulted in the allocation of V2G charging stations over 90 selected residential neighborhoods in Utrecht. Implementing V2G requires a series of preconditions which need to be met, of which the most crucial one, apart from the availability of V2G charging stations, are in place. The dispersion of these stations throughout largely followed the pattern of the inhabitants of the city for the three future scenarios in 2025, 2030 and 2035. However, the “Vogelaar”-neighborhoods which are already disadvantaged neighborhoods show lower numbers. These are important implications for further research. Questions which arise relate to adding weights to the selected socio-economic variables, or to investigate how policy of governments or businesses play a role in stimulating V2G."

Utrecht undergoes this as well, where there is a renewed interest in increasing housing within the city to be able to support the increase in population, where new development plans are made which take place from 2015 to 2030 . With the plans being in development the aim of this research is to understand the possible effects increased density can have on the urban environment. For this research three case studies within Utrecht are researched which are all undergoing increased density. To understand the effects of density the concept of urban liveability is used to have an understanding of the effects of density on the areas. The research shows that density will have both positive and negative impacts on liveability. Where in the case studies negative impacts on health were found, mixed impacts are found on economic stability and positive impacts were found
on the culture and environments of these areas. The research also shows uncertainty around the aspect of infrastructure which is heavily impacted by the increased density within two of the case studies. This comes with the conclusion that the researched areas within Utrecht have a limit when it comes to
density, where at a certain point increased density can have a major negative impact on the urban liveability. However the design of the dense areas impacts both the positive and negative aspects of density. The research hereby shows some of the possible effects of increased density. Where the results create an increased understanding of the effects of density, and the importance of understanding the effects for future urban developments. However with the areas still being under development and that the research is a case study on one area it is still difficult to have a general statement on the effects of density on urban areas."

Mineral resources are finite and eventually all existing mines will cease operating. However, what is often excluded from studies on mining and its impact on the local host-community, is the final stage of a mine’s life-cycle: mine closure. This research set out to describe and analyse the long-term impacts of mining on the livelihoods of host-community members, including implications associated with expected mine closure. It makes use of a particular case study, being that of the Kwale Project in Kwale county, Kenya, where mining company Base Titanium is extracting minerals ever since the start of production in 2013 and is expecting to close the Kwale mine mid-2023. Primary data has been collected through ethnographic participant observation and semi-structured in-depth interviews with community members and other relevant stakeholders carefully selected through snowball sampling. Fieldwork has been carried out in February and March of 2020 in Kwale county, Kenya. Due to the global pandemic and subsequently, the ending of field work, primary data has been complemented with secondary data, consisting of a combination of textual sources (e.g. statistical data archives, previous relevant research, reports from local NGOs, CSOs and Base Titanium, and internet-accessible interlocutors). Outcomes of this research confirm that local host-community members are negatively and positively impacted by Base Titanium’s mining activities in the past, present and presumably also in the future. Positive impacts include a substantial rise in community development projects initiated and implemented by Base Titanium, enhanced skills through the provision of trainings, improved health and nutrition and promising educational opportunities. Negative impacts include adverse environmental consequences, challenges as a result from MIDR relating to conflicts on land-ownership, land use and land value as well as difficulty in sustaining livelihoods and contributing to further marginalization, unavoidable expected loss of employment opportunities, and possible out-migration of skilled mine workers. Moreover, results have brought to the fore that Base Titanium has inadvertently contributed in the creation of a dependency culture among the local community of Kwale county through its implemented Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy. This means that even after closure of the Kwale mine, the local community will be subjected to implications related to mining. Also, a consistent lack of community participation as well as limited collaboration between key stakeholders (e.g. the investor/mining company, national and local government and indigenous/affected communities), are identified as threatening local livelihoods and having adverse implications for local development."
Implementing Housing Regulations through Planning: The Case of Private Midrental Housing and Institutional Investors in Amsterdam,"['Maat, J.M. van der']","['Spit, T.J.M.']",2020-10-13T18:00:31Z,en,['Housing Development; Amsterdam; Institutional Investors; Regulations; Midrental; Housing'],Spatial Planning,"Middle-income households struggle to find affordable housing in Amsterdam due to urbanisation and a growing economy. Despite the growing need for housing, construction in Amsterdam fails to meet contemporary demand and provide affordable housing for middle-income households. Due to urbanisation and a shortage of supply, prices of owner-occupied housing and rents of private rental housing grew to excessive levels, which are too expensive for middle-income households. Additionally, the social rental sector of the Netherlands is restricted to lower income levels. To prevent the exclusion of this income group, the municipality of Amsterdam conducts a combination of inclusionary housing and rent control regulations. However, developers and institutional investors critique the regulations. According to these market parties, the regulations obstruct their abilities to sufficiently meet the shared objective of solving the shortage of private midrental housing. This research aims to explore how institutional investors, developers and the municipality of Amsterdam can efficiently implement these regulations by the following research question:
How can institutional investors and the municipality of Amsterdam efficiently implement midrental housing regulations through housing development processes of institutional investors in Amsterdam?
This research conducted a document analysis and semi-structured interviews at institutional investors, developers and the municipality of Amsterdam. By executing a single case-study, this research aims to exemplify theory and give practical recommendations.
This thesis argues that economic viability and the capacity of the municipality to implement the rules are essential for the regulations to succeed. The municipality of Amsterdam applied a collaborative approach in drafting the regulations to prevent a fallback in housing production. By consulting and addressing the resources of institutional investors and developers, the regulations aim to take financial interests into account. Additionally, the municipality of Amsterdam holds a significant steering capacity over housing developments by a tender approach for plot developments and the land lease system. Therefore, the municipality is able to obligate housing constructions to comply with their objectives before and after a property is built.
Despite the agreement, the obligations reduce potential revenues of institutional investors and developers. To overcome this effect, market parties lower construction costs by reducing the quality of midrental dwellings. Nevertheless, due to high initial costs and the accumulation of other prescribed conditions, the financial risk in housing development projects increased. Consequently, institutional investors with low-risk commitments are predominantly outcompeted by higher-risk investor groups.
To prevent the discouragement of institutional investors, the municipality can lower building costs by adjusting land values and apply a more ‘area-based approach’ of the ’40-40-20 rule’. Moreover, institutional investors can invest in existing properties and after that, initiate a property transformation to reduce competition. To conclude, this research suggests that a more extensive land capacity and a more managerial role of the municipality in area developments holds the promise to reduce competition and lower development risks. Additionally, these actions of the municipality can overcome the reliance on economic cycles and efficiently execute the objectives of midrental housing regulations."
Local Residents at Home in an Increasingly Global City: How does the increasing internationalisation of Amsterdam's population influence the place attachment of long-term Dutch residents of Amsterdam Westerpark?,"['Huiberts, T.W.']","['Visser, K.']",2020-10-13T18:00:34Z,en,['Internationalisation; population; expats; expatriates; Amsterdam; locals; place attachment; foreign residents'],Human Geography,"Amsterdam is home to a growing population of international residents that live in the city for a limited period of time – such as expats, international students and other groups of (mostly Western) temporary migrants. Although this contemporary population development is rather significant and (local) media outlets frequently report on it, there is a lack of scientific research on how this trend is perceived by the Dutch population of the city. To investigate how long-term Dutch residents perceive possible influences of the growing share of temporary foreign residents on the city and on the way they feel at place, this study poses the following research question: How does the increasing internationalisation of Amsterdam's population influence the place attachment of long-term (>10 years) Dutch residents of Amsterdam Westerpark on both the neighbourhood level and the city level? In order to answer this question, a comprehensive literature study is executed and 21 in-depth interviews with long-term residents of Amsterdam Westerpark are conducted. The most important finding of this study is that the increasing internationalisation of the Amsterdam population does not substantially influence the place attachment of long-term Dutch residents of Westerpark. There are, however, large individual differences in how this population trend is perceived among Dutch residents – whereas some love it, others resent it. The vast majority of the Westerpark residents fosters moderately positive opinions towards this trend, as they generally welcome international influences as an added value to the city. However, the same majority of the residents also voices critical notes on several aspects of the internationalisation development – which indicates a certain ambivalence among a large share of the Amsterdammers. Especially the proliferation of the English language, the effects on the housing market, and the rather limited and superficial social contacts with temporary foreign residents are mentioned frequently as downsides of this development that are not appreciated. Overall, however, the majority of the Westerpark residents is all right with the current presence of temporary foreign residents in the city and the neighbourhood. Above all, it does not negatively affect their overarching place attachment or sense of home – with the exception of small share of the residents that is predominantly critical about the development. Finally, this study advices to take the sentiments and opinions of long-term Dutch residents into account when developing policies aimed at attracting (highly skilled) foreign residents to Amsterdam – something which hitherto is largely overlooked."

Urban youth have a high demand for mobility, which is a resource of particular importance for them to prosper. The bicycle is an affordable and accessible mode of transport that since recently is gaining popularity in many cities worldwide. A knowledge gap exists in these cities on what role the bicycle plays in the lives and mobilities of youth. Therefore the research aims to understand what influence the bicycle has on the urban daily mobilities of youth in immature cycling cultures and how these mobilities are explained. The research is based on three different data sources, two systematic review analysis’, an examination of a quantitative data set of Mexico City, and empirical data from Cali (Colombia) drawn from fieldwork and interviews. These data sources give insight in the characteristics, freedoms and constraints of cycling, and what role the bicycle has in forming identities. The bicycle is often used for daily commutes, especially because it is fast and convenient in the city. It provides the rider with joy, flexibility, independent travel, control and freedom. The bicycle is an important identity marker for youth that often influences their lifestyle. However, riders risks accidents, harm or violence while cycling, which profoundly influencing their mobilities. At last, social norms have great influence on attitudes of youth towards cycling. The research argues that the bicycle matches in many ways the demand and desires of youth and their mobilities. However, since the vulnerability and exposure of cycling plays out differently for different personal factors the potential advantages are not felt by all youth. Further research is needed to better understand the relation between personal safety and cycling as mode of transport for youth."

While these are both relatively popular themes in social and development studies, the relationship between the two has not been given enough attention. This thesis will be broken up into three main sections: a theoretical section, an analysis section, and a case study. The research takes the form of a literature review, scanning relevant information to gain a full understanding of the two topics and synthesize their relationship. This will be done by first breaking down the definitions and relevance of each topic in relation to development studies, then analysing examples of global understanding, implementations and policies in various contexts. Finally, to use a more specific and in-depth example, this thesis will subsequently look at peri-urbanization and social cohesion in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, a country that has been experiencing rapid urban expansion including peri-urbanization all over the country for the last three and a half decades and dramatic social changes over the last century. Considering the three pillars of cohesion to be 1) social inclusion, 2) social mobility, and 3) social capital, this thesis finds that peri-urbanization has several different and complex effects on the multi-dimensional topic of cohesion, with some positive and some negative for various stakeholders. For instance, peri-urbanization generally leads to political fragmentation and exclusion, which hinders cohesion. It often brings economic growth, but not always inclusively and can instead exacerbate inequality. It also generally increases social capital and networks but may decrease the strength of ties. Different contexts of course see different processes, results, and changes. More empirical qualitative research is necessary for international development and social studies scholars as well as policy makers to understand cohesion in peri-urbanization. This thesis stresses that greater local political representation is necessary to bring in residents’ voices into the changes surrounding their own livelihoods and lifestyles."

the gender dynamics, vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities of smallholder farmers in the
Global South. The impact of CVC is explored by using a Systematic Literature Review
[SLR]. This entails a comprehensive selection process, classification and inclusion criteria
through which 56 relevant peer reviewed articles were selected and studied. Research niches
are found in social dynamics of CVC impacts and the very regional research scope. The
current SLR facilitates the research by showing a global, general and transparent overview on
this subject.
The relevant articles show that female and male smallholder cultivators have different levels
of vulnerability and adaptation capacity in regard to CVC. CVC amplifies gender
inequalities, enhances vulnerabilities and urges communities to become more resilient.
Women are often lacking access to representation, finances, inheritance rights, information
and knowledge. Furthermore, the research found that women cultivators in the Global South
often lack power to influence important decision-making processes to adaptation strategies
and other higher investments. Female cultivators also generally lack representations and
involvement within policies, meetings and development strategy inputs. This all makes
women more vulnerable in times of climatic stress. Gender subordination is found in all
sectors of agricultural activities, and is often driven through social, cultural and institutional
barriers.
The findings show that CVC and gender are inseparable and mutually inclusive. The higher
level of vulnerability of women seems to be linked to lack of access, assets and control over
natural resources. There is an urgent need for women and previously marginalized groups to
be included in decision-making processes and become more empowered. It is crucial to focus
on all barriers smallholder farmers might face in CVC situations. Empowerment of women is
the key to achieving more global food security and finding more resilient ways of battling
CVC."

While it is a strategic commodity for the country and provides jobs for millions of people, the rapid expansion of oil palm has brought environmental and social concerns: deforestation, land clearing, loss of biodiversity, land degradation, increase in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as land conflicts, human rights violations and challenges around food security. Although there are efforts towards more sustainable production of Indonesian palm oil, none of them deal with the existing 3.4 million hectares of oil palm plantations located in the forest areas, largely without clear land statuses and license to operate. According to current regulations, all of those plantations would need to be removed, cutting the livelihoods of 6 million rural Indonesians. The Strategi Jangka Benah was developed to reconcile the reduction of negative environmental impacts with maintaining the livelihoods of smallholder farmers whose plantations are in designated forest areas by implementing oil palm agroforestry. In order to be successful, Strategi Jangka Benah’s role will need to extend beyond sustainable forestry design, it needs to be embedded into the institutional system within which it operates. This requires institutional change. This research explored how local institutions can better facilitate the transition of smallholder oil palm farmers from monoculture plantations to oil palm agroforestry through a three-step institutional analysis process, starting with an actor analysis, followed by an analysis of the rules of the game. The last step was a capacity analysis for institutional innovation. The institutional analysis process conducted for the Strategi Jangka Benah also served as an experiment to review the existing processes, tools and academic literature related to institutional analysis, concluding that there is a need for shared understanding of institutions and institutional capacity across Development Studies, and for more research to understand how to facilitate the process of an institutional system adopting to change."

However, in terms of the recent mixed migration
flows EU values such as solidarity and respect for human dignity have not been upheld across the

of EU countries shifted. The securitisation of migration is seen as the prominent reason for this shift.
Migration became a security issue within the EU and especially the external border countries are
pressured to have strong and effective border control. Croatia is an example of this, where allegedly
the inhumane and degrading treatment of refugees and migrants has become a tool of deterrence at
the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this thesis, it will be investigated how the values solidarity
and respect for human dignity can be upheld in the implementation of EU migration policy at the
Croatian-Bosnian border. This is of crucial importance to the EU as its functionality depends on the
shared belief in values. An in-depth understanding of the situation at the Croatian-Bosnian border is
needed in order to determine how the values can be upheld. The research explores; the problems
associated with EU migration policy, the relation between the EU and the two Balkan countries, the
discrepancy between EU values in policy and in practice, and the securitisation of migration. The
central objective of this thesis is to determine whether EU values have been upheld as well as
identifying the responsibility and accountability of actors at the Croatian-Bosnian border through the

No moderating effect of chronotype was found. Explanations for these findings are given, as well as strengths and limitations of this study. The findings of this study are of great theoretical and practical value, because they show that prevention programs should focus on short-term and not on long-term health consequences when targeting awareness in the population. Suggestions for future research were given."

The impact of social support and invalidation on the severity of somatic symptoms in women with fibromyalgia,"['Schelwald, R.S.']","['Geenen, R.']",2020-10-14T18:00:11Z,en,['fibromyalgia; social support; invalidation; symptom severity'],Clinical Psychology,"The current study examines the association of perceived social support and invalidation with the severity of somatic symptoms in women with fibromyalgia, using a patient-based research methodology. The model used in this research proposes that fibromyalgia is rooted in an imbalance between the ‘threat’ system and the ‘soothing’ system, as described by Gilbert´s affect regulation model (Gilbert, 2005). This study focused on the social side of this model. Literature reveals the positive impacts of social support on health and well-being for patients, and a relation between social support and perceived pain severity. Research also indicates the potency of negative impact by invalidation, a social threat, in predicting well-being. In the current study, patients with enduring physical symptoms had identified all factors that threaten or soothe them. In the current study 64 women with fibromyalgia participated (mean age 47, ranging from 22 to 65). They completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 to establish the severity of their symptoms. Through regression analysis it was examined whether the importance placed in social support as a soother, and the importance placed in invalidation as a threat is associated with the severity if somatic symptoms. Relationship status was significantly correlated with social support (p= .03) and entered as a covariate. The regression analysis showed that neither social support nor invalidation nor the interaction between the two significantly predicted PHQ-15 values (F =1.565, p =.22, R2 adj.=.0254). This may be due to forced sorting procedure. Participants had to sort 5 piles for the value they placed in each soother and threat: if a participant regarded all soothers as equally soothing, she still had to hierarchically sort them on a scale of 1 to 5, from least to most soothing (or threatening, for threats). This may have caused a distorted view of the importance that participants placed in the social support or invalidation statements. Furthermore, participants who were in a relationship (51 participants) put higher importance in social support than did participants who were single (13 participants), with 69.33% of singles in in ‘high’ versus 92.16% of those in a relationship. This perhaps caused the sample size for low social support to become too small to generate an effect, because no good comparison could be made between low importance social support and high importance in social support. More research on the way that social support or invalidation shapes the disease experience is necessary to understand the impact of the value that people with fibromyalgia themselves place in social support and invalidation."

Creative role identity was considered as the moderator of the relationship between ambidextrous leadership and creative process engagement. The participants consisted of 98 employees (61.2% females, Mage = 29.5 years) that were asked to rate their leader’s practices and assess their own creative and innovative attitudes. Although the results of the moderated mediation analysis showed no significant link between ambidextrous leadership and innovative work behaviors, we found significant positive relationships between ambidextrous leadership and creative process engagement, creative process engagement and innovative work behaviors, and creative role identity and creative process engagement.

'Migrating' within the Kingdom - Mobility patterns and motives to move in the process of migration from the European Netherlands to Bonaire,"['Hondius, J.J.']","['Pijl, I.H., van der']",2020-10-19T18:00:18Z,en,"['North-South migration, new mobilities paradigm, migrants, mobility, late-modern Kingdom of the Netherlands, Bonaire, Dutch Caribbean Studies.']",Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship,"""This thesis examines an annually-growing migration flow from the Global North to the Global South
in general, and in particular from the European Netherlands to the Dutch Caribbean, with a focus on
Bonaire. This movement takes place in the specific context of the late-modern Kingdom of the
Netherlands. The aim of this thesis is to understand what kind of motives and incentives exist for the
European Dutch migrant to move to Bonaire, and what kind of mobility patterns are involved in that
movement. Due to the little existing literature about North-South migration within Dutch Caribbean
Studies, it has not been clear until now what kind of forces drive, restrict and produce this mobility.
The context of this migration offers more understanding of this form of mobility, where a latemodern Kingdom with a long colonial past changed its political structure in 2010. This newlyrestructured Kingdom finds itself in a fast-paced era full of developing global technologies, systems,
and policies that connect different parts of the world with each other. The  new mobilities paradigm 
of Sheller and Urry (2006) offers a deeper understanding of this fast-paced era: they argue that new
travel and communication technologies have enabled social life at a distance, and that in this new
paradigm travel becomes necessary for social life and becomes a lifestyle. Four groups of European
Dutch migrants on Bonaire are identified in this research: expatriates, residential tourists,
pensionados, and fortune-seekers. All four groups of migrants can be understood by Bauman s
concept of a late-modern tourist (1996), but all four have personal motivations and incentives. These
migrants from the Global North have a relatively great freedom in their movement and can easily
move between the European Netherlands and Bonaire. It is a privileged migrant, with access to time
and capital, who experiences freedom in their movement. However, this seemingly privileged
position of the European Dutch migrant can alter during a pandemic, which shows the restrictions of
late-modern mobility. The effects of the Corona pandemic (COVID-19) in 2020 have shown how the
borders function within the boundaries of the late-modern Kingdom of the Netherlands, and have
immobilized the ability of the  privileged  migrant from the European Netherlands to move freely
within the boundaries of that Kingdom."""

the Noordoostpolder, which lies in the province of Flevoland in the Netherlands. Emmeloord
would become the foodshed of the Netherlands. Emmeloord was the promised land for
agriculture and attracted many farmers and agricultural companies. It was also the hotspot for
seasonal workers who were very often labor migrants from outside the Netherlands. Today
Emmeloord is a multicultural society of 26.000 citizens with a Women s center. This center was
initially established in 2007 by the initiative of a few women working in the healthcare sector.
Their goal was to provide a safe meeting place for migrant women who experienced
psychosomatic complaints as a result of their isolated social situation. A few migrant women
joined this initiative. In this thesis, there will be no generalization on how women with a
migration background experience citizenship, but an individual approach where every case will
be analyzed separately. Throughout the thesis, the different challenges women, in particular, face
in their daily encounters as migrants in Emmeloord but also the opportunities they gain through
migration will be discussed. Through the application of different theories on citizenship, gender,

In the context of neoliberalism, the Dutch redifferentiation policy will be explained as an urban strategy causing gentrification under the guise of  social mixing . This policy of bringing higher-income residents into deprived neighborhoods creates a very real threat, that of the displacement of the incumbent working-class residents. However, rather than concentrating on the often-discussed physical displacement, this research focuses on the social effects of gentrification through the concept of 'indirect displacement'. This concept, together with Bourdieu s Theory of Capital (1986), shows how the renewal and the redifferentiation of the housing stock has changed the neighborhood into a place where the older established residents and newcomers live next to each other, instead of with each other. I will thus sketch a critical view on Dutch urban policy, positing that space itself becomes a  marker of class identity  (Herzfeld 2009, 22). In addition, I will use the concepts of mobility and collectivity, to give a brief, broader perspective on social transformations within the neighborhood."

This thesis looks at the barriers preventing these initiatives from jointly establishing a successful sustainable food partnership in Cambridge, one of the most prosperous and yet unequal cities in the UK. The focus is on the divide between the third sector, as Sustainable Food Voluntary Organisations (SFVOs) represent most initiatives across the city, and the public sector, as the City Council has particular responsibility and power. The central research question is this: How does the (lack of) interaction between SFVOs and the City Council in Cambridge (UK) affect the establishment of a cross-sectoral sustainable food partnership? The fieldwork for this ethnographic research was conducted over three months. The key methods used were participant observation, mainly within eight SFVOs, and semi-structured interviews with 33 research participants, representing 11 SFVOs and the Council. The research reveals that, on the one hand, due to a lack of faith and mistrust in the Council and politics in general, citizens and SFVOs express their sustainable food convictions through personalised and civic politics. On the other hand, SFVOs who do interact with the Council, mainly through the Council's Sustainable City Grants, experience an unequal power balance in favour of the Council, which puts various pressures on SFVOs. Therefore, neither the lack of nor the actual interaction between SFVOs and the Council provide a basis for joining forces in an egalitarian way to make Cambridge a sustainable food city. The societal relevance of this research is that it provides a stepping-stone to establishing a cross-sectoral sustainable food partnership in Cambridge. The understanding of barriers to partnerships around sustainable food is also a valuable contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals. The academic relevance of this research is that it fills an existing gap in ethnographic explorations into barriers to the establishment of cross-sectoral sustainable food partnerships in the UK."

The aim of the current study was to objectively describe the vertical upper-body movement asymmetry of owner-sound elite dressage horses in trot in hand on the straight and collected- and extended trot during a standardized dressage test. Differences in protraction and retraction of the fore- and hindlimb pairs were also analysed. Linear mixed models were performed for all variables with horse ID as random effect and trot condition as fixed effects. There was a significant increase in ROM of the head (p&lt;0.01), withers (p&lt;0.01) and pelvis (p&lt;0.01) for both extended trot and collected trot compared with trot in hand. For collected trot vs. trot in hand, an increase was seen in HDmin (p&lt;0.01), HDmax (p&lt;0.01), WDmax (p&lt;0.01) and PDmin (p=0.04). For extended trot vs. trot in hand, there was an increase in HDmin (p&lt;0.01), HDmax (p&lt;0.01) and WDmax (p=0.04).

An increase in DiffRetraction of the front limbs was seen for extended trot vs. trot in hand (p=0.02) and extended trot vs. collected trot (p=0.02). Factors that could have affected movement asymmetry under saddle include the increased ROM, the rider’s aids, the rider’s weight, the rider’s static or dynamic postural asymmetry, the horse’s head-neck position and the horse’s laterality pattern. Regarding trot in hand measurements, horses showed asymmetry values greater than the currently recommended symmetry thresholds. This raises the highly important question: should all of our dressage horses, based on their degree of upper-body asymmetry, be classified as lame? Or should the current symmetry thresholds be re-evaluated, at least for highly trained sports horses? These asymmetries namely might also be the result of laterality, conformation, shoeing or training. The main conclusion of this study was that no elite dressage horse will trot perfectly symmetrical, neither in a natural moving trot in hand on the straight nor in collected- and extended trot under saddle. It should be investigated to what degree detectable movement asymmetries in dressage horses can be directly attributed to orthopaedic pain or natural asymmetry in the horse’s locomotor pattern. Furthermore, studies investigating the long-term effect of asymmetrical motion on the development of musculoskeletal injuries would be appropriate as part of prevention and early recognition of orthopaedic disease in the dressage horse."

Thus, this study examines the effects of sports club membership on young people’s perception of social cohesion and social participation in the neighbourhood, while taking gender and ethnicity into account. For this research, data was
collected during face-to-face interviews and via phone interviews amongst 81 young people aged between 12 and 22 years, with an average age of 16.64 years (SD = 2.18). The participants were from 10 municipalities in the Netherlands and data was collected between February and April 2020. The perception of social cohesion was measured by using de Veiligheidsmonitor (the Safety Monitor; 2017) and social participation was measured by
using the social exclusion index (2014). The data were analysed by conducting a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). The results showed that young people with a sports club membership (compared to young people without a membership) have a significantly
higher perception of social cohesion (M = 4.02, SD = 0.07 versus M = 3.77, SD = 0.08) and social participation (M = 3.11, SD = 0.04 versus M = 2.95, SD = 0.05) in neighbourhoods.

In order to improve their 
 efficiency, a fundamental understanding of the excitation and recombination mechanisms of charge carriers in materials is needed. In this work, we investigate carrier dynamics of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and GaAs using fast electrons as the excitation source, in contrast to previous experiments in which carriers are optically induced. Our results are largely based on time resolved single photon counting measurements. The fast electrons are generated by a femtosecond laser-driven scanning 
electron microscope which generates pulses consisting of (statistically) less than one electron up to 1200 electrons per pulse at voltages between 5 and 30 kV. We analyse our results both qualitatively and quantitatively by considering Auger, radiative, Shockley-Read-Hall and Surface recombination. For CZTS, we have found a value of B = (4.8+-0.2)10^-10cm^3s^-1 for the bimolecular coefficient in optical experiments. We observe that this value becomes variable as a function of number of electrons per pulse in fast electron experiments: B / N_e^-1.1 . In the case of GaAs, the model does not show a good ?t with the data. However, we distinguish two main decay mechanisms, one in a short timescale (up to 0.5 ns) and a second one in the longer timescale (tens of ns), which we attribute to Shockley-Read-Hall recombination."

Six years later, instability has spread throughout the Sahel, while Operation Barkhane has increased its troops from 3,000 up to 5,100. This raises the question of what kind of counterinsurgency strategy Barkhane pursues in the Sahel. By using the analytical framework of ‘counterinsurgency’, this thesis analyses Operation Barkhane’s counterinsurgency and concludes that it is enemy-centric in nature. The thesis shows the complications of Operation Barkhane’s enemy-centric counterinsurgency strategy by using Barkhane’s operations in Burkina Faso as a case study. The case of Burkina Faso highlights the problematic preoccupation with the military aspect which decontextualises the ‘enemy’, focuses on the symptoms of the Sahelian crisis instead of on the root causes, and renders cooperation with the Sahelian governments unproblematic."

Uit de literatuurstudie en expertinterviews zijn zeven potentieel werkzame elementen voor de impacttheorie gesynthetiseerd: sociale ondersteuning, open en effectieve communicatie, autoritatieve opvoedingsstijl, weerbaarheid en ondersteuning binnen het gezin, bewustmaken van handelen, betrokkenheid bij je kind en stimuleren van assertiviteit. Daarnaast zijn vijf randvoorwaarden voor de procestheorie gesynthetiseerd: cultuursensitieve trainer, veilige leeromgeving, vertrouwensrelatie, genderspecifieke training en een bottom-up aanpak. Met deze elementen is een analyse uitgevoerd op de documenten van WO. Hier is gevonden dat de meeste elementen ‘enigszins’ of ‘goed’ beschreven en verantwoord werden. Desalniettemin bleken grote gaten in de programmatheorie. Een belangrijk voorbeeld hiervan is het ontbreken van het element ‘ondersteuning binnen het gezin’. Aanbevolen wordt om de theoretische onderbouwing uit te breiden van de interventieactiviteiten, de rol van de trainer en het versterken van de eigen weerbaarheid van de ouder erin op te nemen.

High resolution simulations of methane concentrations in the Netherlands using WRF-Chem,"['Quax, I.T.B.']","['Velders, G.J.M.']",2020-10-22T18:00:14Z,en_US,"['methane, emissions, WRF-Chem, high resolution simulations, greenhouse gas, climate change']",Climate Physics,"Enhanced methane CH4 concentrations account for 23% of the anthropogenic radiative forcing. This study seeks to contribute to the insights in the methane emissions in the Netherlands. In this study  the WRF-Chem model is used to conduct simulations of CH4 concentrations in the Netherlands. The aim of this study is to test the quality of high resolution simulations of methane concentration. An emission inventory with a resolution of 1 km x 1 km is used as input in the WRF-Chem model. High resolution simulations of the methane concentration in 2017 are conducted with a grid size of 3 km x 3 km, on the domain of the Netherlands. The emissions from the inventory were used as input for 13 individual tracers, one for every emission subgroup in the inventory. To test the quality of these simulations, the results are compared with  in situ measurements of methane concentration from measurement sites at Lutjewad and Cabauw. The analysis showed an underestimation of the simulated CH4 concentration compared to the observed CH4 concentration during peak events. This underestimation is probably caused by using the average CH4 emissions over the volume of a 3 km x 3 km grid as input. For this reason local plume emissions are less dense in the simulations. The observed diurnal range in the CH4 concentrations is 3 to 4 times larger at Lutjewad and Cabauw than the diurnal range in the simulated CH4 concentration during summer. The opposite would be expected from the daytime nighttime ratio of the boundary layer height, which is larger in the simulations than in the observations. Furthermore, implementing diurnal variability in several smaller emission sources did not improve the diurnal range in the simulated methane concentration. The WRF-Chem simulations correctly reproduce the wind direction for which the excess CH4 concentration is highest in Lutjewad. The relative magnitude of the excess CH4 concentration for this wind direction is underestimated in the simulations. This can be caused by the poor representation of the diffusion of plume emission in the simulation. Another cause could be underestimated methane emissions around the measurement sites. The WRF-Chem simulations showed underestimations in the magnitude of the variability of methane concentration on several timescales. In order to increase the accuracy of the WRF-Chem simulations of CH4 concentrations, further research is need to gain insight into the causes of the differences in the variability of the simulated and observed CH4 concentrations."

Het doel van dit onderzoek was om te onderzoeken hoe leerkrachten in het primair onderwijs reflecteren op het werken aan seksuele integriteit met kinderen. In totaal hebben 16 basisschool leerkrachten meegewerkt aan dit onderzoek. De data is verzameld doormiddel van focusgroepgesprekken en individuele interviews. Deze werden geanalyseerd op basis van de kernprincipes van seksuele integriteit en werden respectievelijk open, axiaal en selectief gecodeerd. Uit de bevindingen blijkt dat leerkrachten regelmatig in aanraking komen met situaties waarbij seksuele integriteit een rol speelt. Leerkrachten zetten verschillende concepten in om hier adequaat en sensitief naar te handelen. Ouders worden gezien als partners bij het werken aan seksuele integriteit, maar het is ook een uitdaging. Een aanbeveling is om op de pabo aankomende leerkrachten pedagogische vaardigheden, die nodig zijn om met kinderen te werken aan seksuele integriteit, kennis over de seksuele ontwikkeling en handvatten om met ouders in gesprek te gaan over seksualiteit en gender, aan te reiken."

Transmission and beam shaping of a Gaussian light beam passing through a dense Rubidium vapour,"['Buist, G.']","['Oosten, D. van']",2020-10-22T18:00:13Z,en,[],Experimental Physics,"Laser light can exhibit nonlinear behaviour when interacting with dense atomic vapours.
This can give rise to a variety of interesting phenomena such as slow light and optically induced transparency. Recently A.~J. van Lange measured nonlinear transmission of light through a Rubidium vapour and developed a physical model to describe these measurements. Van Lange also investigated the formation of different beam profiles, in a dense Rubidium vapour and from Gaussian input beams, as a function of intensity and optical frequency.

Here we expand on van Lange's measurements by measuring over a large frequency range which includes multiple atomic transition lines and by employing off-axis holography which allows for simultaneous measurement of the intensity and phase. Analysis of beam profiles based on the structural similarity index (SSIM) uncovered beam profiles whose path through intensity-detuning space could be described with van Lange's generalised detuning curve. Off-axis holography measurements are in agreement with regular intensity measurements but exhibits a greater amount of noise."

"Modeling waves and currents in muddy coastal
areas, with a focus on the Suriname coastal zone","['Tzampazidou, M.E.']","['Swart, Huib E. de', 'Smits, Bob P.', 'Vries, Job de', 'Nnafie, Abdel', 'Jong, Steven M. de']",2020-10-22T18:00:15Z,en,"['SWAN-Mud, Delft3D-FLOW, Mud dynamics, Waves, Currents, DELFT, GADE, Suriname.']",Climate Physics,"The mudbanks in front of the coast of Suriname are an important coastal feature and play a key role in coastal evolution by governing the flow and wave characteristics. Suriname is located in the center of the Guiana basin and it is characterized by its erosional muddy coastal area. The Amazon river is supplying the Guiana basin with about 7-10 x10^8 tons of sediment every year, leading to the formation of long mudbanks that migrate along its coasts. Moreover, the trade winds, which arrive mainly from the northeast, prevent the large Amazon plume as well as the mudbanks to extend further than 30 km offshore. Hydrodynamics in Suriname are also influenced by semi-diurnal tides that acquire a tidal range of up to 2.8 m and by waves that reach up to 4 m offshore during extreme conditions. 

Measures need to be taken in order to prevent coastal erosion and flooding and to compensate for the imminent sea-level rise. Although field campaigns took place in the past, the effect of the mudbanks on waves and tidal currents has not been extensively studied. A modeling approach is needed in order to understand in detail the complex dynamics that govern this coastal area. This study aims at identifying the correct tools in order to close that knowledge gap and provide a detailed analysis on the hydrodynamics of the area. More particular, SWAN-Mud and Delft3D-FLOW are used for the first time in order to study the dynamics in the coastal area of Suriname.

The state of the art numerical wave model SWAN-Mud is used in order to simulate waves in the muddy coastal area of Suriname. Particular attention is paid to the sensitivity of results to using different formulations for wave energy dissipation by mud. DELFT formulation (Kranenburg, 2011) shows that waves are severely dissipated as soon as they arrive at the mud layer: significant wave height reduces instantly, total and mud-induced dissipation increase sharply, wave energy is shifted towards larger frequencies, waves refract up to 50 degrees towards the coast (southwards) and orbital velocity decreases as a result of wave dissipation. DELFT formulation is in agreement with a previous study by Winterwerp (2007) at the Guyana coastline, but Gade formulation, which is tested as well, is found to have similar results except for the wave energy distribution (Wells and Coleman, 1981). 

Furthermore, the commonly-used numerical flow model Delft3D-FLOW is used in order to simulate tidal currents in the coastal area of Suriname. The main tidal characteristics are in accordance with findings in the literature, i.e. M2 is the most dominant tidal component (Augustinus, 1978), tides arrive perpendicular to the coast,  and the tidal phase does not vary significantly (Kagan and
Sofina, 2014). A coupling between Delft3D-FLOW and Delft3D-WAVE does not take place, as the latter uses the regular version of SWAN that cannot take into account the mud layer. Results from Delft3D are expected to be of higher accuracy if it is coupled to SWAN-Mud. In this case, it will be possible to model erosion, transport, and deposition of mud."

This discourse of cyberwar has been contested by scholars and professionals: in reality the event was nothing close to a war and therefore there also did not have to be military retaliation from NATO. By studying the event using Copenhagen School Securitization theory, it seems like it constitutes a failed or partially successful securitizing move i.e. an attempt at assigning an issue the identity of existential threat in order to legitimize extraordinary measures. This thesis, arguing from a post-structuralist position, views securitization as a gradual, long term process in constituted out of both discursive (speech act) and non-discursive -practices (extraordinary measures). The central question that the thesis seeks to answer is: How has a securitizing discourse on cyber threats legitimized the militarization of cyberspace in Estonia after the country experienced cyber-attacks in 2007? By making use of discourse analysis, this thesis argues that the discourse of cyberwar – or the militarization of cyber security – was shaped through its repetition over a longer time that make the immaterial/ virtual visible.  The military securitizing practices reinforced and disseminated the idea of the cyber-threat and cyberwar narrative, but were also only possible because they were legitimized through this securitizing narrative. Simultaneously, these practices imbued the securitizing narrative with the material and thereby stabilized the discourse. Instead of treating securitization according to a sequential causality, it is a co-constitutive process in which the ideational and material interact and complement each other."

Currently rural communities across the globe are facing several demographic challenges which raised interest in the concept of community resilience by scholars and policy makers. Strikingly, however, is that those traditional community characteristics are found to foster resilience. This study aims to better understand the process of resilience building so that rural communities can become more resilient through effective use of their strengths. To this end insights from complex adaptive system theory are used which makes resilience an ongoing process of experiencing adversities to which communities adapt through co-evolution and self-organization. A key theme in this perspective is human agency which helps explain how and why community members respond to changes the way they do. Adopting this perspective comes with several methodological implications and has resulted into a comparative research design that through a mixed-methods approach analyzes the resilience of the communities Edinbane and Dunvegan located in the Scottish highlands. The central argument that arises out of the findings is that in rural communities small changes can have large (un)desired consequences."

Post90s urban gay men have higher acceptance towards homosexual identity and lower acceptance towards conducting homosexual behaviour or visiting homosexual place in urban public space. They have different levels of awareness towards the heteronormativity of the urban public space. They also notice the suppression brought by such heteronormativity to their identity cognition pathway. As a compromise, they instead satisfy homosexual needs in an understated way to avoid identity exposure. Meanwhile, they transform part of homosexual social life to the relatively free and less heteronormative digital space that is more private and accessible for their group. Also, they value the geographical space such as restaurants, cafes, malls and squares, as it provides public places to develop online connections. Besides, concepts like “gay cruising” “gay neighbourhood” and “space for performance” in western research are discussed in the condition associated with the reality of China."
