How Standard Beauty Ideals Offered by Fashion Brands affect Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Self-Esteem in Men,"['Schneider, Janik']","['Cicco, Francesca di']",2022-08-03T00:01:12Z,EN,['body dysmorphic disorder; body image; self-esteem; men’s health; fashion'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","The present study investigated beauty ideal-related implications for men by exploring the effects of body positive and body idealistic images, as presented by fashion brands and social media, on body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). BDD is heavily linked to negative body image and low self-esteem, and will therefore be measured on these variables. Efforts to include men in the body positive movement have been rather spare. The movement’s purpose was to empower women of all shapes and sizes by posting images of models that are more representative of the general public. Therefore, it is hypothesized that body idealistic images have negative effects on both body image and self-esteem, whereas body positive images have positive effects. Subsequently, it was hypothesized that these body idealistic images pose a greater threat to BDD. Lastly, it was hypothesized that body image related issues are indifferent amongst men and women. Participants were exposed to either nothing, body idealistic images or body positive images followed by questionnaires that would measure body image, BDD, self-esteem and sociocultural attitudes towards appearance. Results indicated that body idealistic images have a negative effect on men’s self-esteem, and body positive images have a positive effect. This study does not indicate whether body idealistic images pose a greater threat to BDD, but it has shown that there are no gender differences. Taken together, the results indicate that men should receive equal treatment in online portrayed beauty ideals for the sake of their self-esteem."
Bridging the Theory-practice Gap: Pre-service Teachers’ Voices on Internship Experiences,"['Levy Morchio, Denise']","['Georgiou, D.']",2022-08-03T00:01:08Z,EN,['Teacher Education; Connecting Theory and Practice; Internship; Early Childhood Education; Preservice Teachers'],Educational Sciences,"The gap between theory and practice has been widely reported in teacher education and internships have been identified as a privileged way to bridge this gap. Nevertheless, there is not enough research on how early childhood pre-service teachers translate educational theory into their teaching practice during internships, especially in university programs that follow an evidence-based educational approach. This study explores the case of Chile, where university-level training for early childhood teachers is mandatory, and examines how early childhood pre-service teachers integrate theory and practice during internships. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with N = 10 Chilean pre-service early childhood teachers from two university-level programs. The results indicate that pre-service teachers are able to make meaningful connections between theory and practice during internships, both by applying the acquired theoretical knowledge during training and by reflecting on their teaching practice during university courses. Enabling and hindering factors such as the support and feedback provided by supervisors and mentors are critical in the pre-service teachers’ experience. This study contributes to research and practice with a comprehensive overview of the key elements involved in the process of integrating theory and practice during teaching internships."
Determining Chlorophyll-a degradation and its accuracy as a particle-tracer for bioturbation compared to luminophores,"['Beinum, Julia van']","['Soetaert, Karline']",2022-08-09T00:00:51Z,EN,['Bioturbation rates; Bioturbation potential; Chlorophyll-a degradation; Luminophores; Macrobenthos; Ecosystem functioning'],Marine Sciences,"By mixing sediment particles, marine bioturbating animals have an essential influence on ecosystem functioning. To estimate how animals affect ecosystem functions, it is necessary to test widely used methods for accuracy and improve bioturbation quantification methods. In this study Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and luminophores were used as particle-tracers to quantify bioturbation rates (Db) in muddy and sandy sediments of the Dutch Eastern Scheldt. The muddy site (Zandkreek) held 7.45 times more biomass and 3.64 times higher abundance compared to the sandy site (Dortsman). Luminophore- based bioturbation rates corresponded well with sediment oxygen consumption and the biological trait derived Bioturbation Potential index (BPc), which were all significantly higher in muddy Zandkreek. In contrast, estimated Chl-a-based bioturbation rates measured were not significantly different between sediment types and corresponded poorly with BPc and oxygen consumption. Also, in both sediment types Chl-a-based bioturbation rates were an order of magnitude higher than the luminophore-based bioturbation rates. Anaerobic Chl-a degradation (kd) was 50% and 25% lower than aerobic Chl-a degradation in sandy and muddy sites respectfully, but the large confidence interval highlights the variability in kd. Furthermore, kd values in this study were an order of magnitude smaller compared to kd values previously determined in other bioturbation studies. The variability in Chl-a degradation causes uncertainty in Chl-a-based bioturbation rates, owing to the linear scaling between the two variables in biodiffusive mixing models. Because Chl-a degradation varies under a range of environmental (redox) conditions, the use of Chl-a as a particle tracer in bioturbation quantification should, therefore, be considered with caution."
Should You Dare to Be Different? The Effect of Perceived Personal Distance in Early-Stage Investment Decision Making.,"['Deursen, Daan van']","['Balen, Timo van']",2022-08-09T00:00:55Z,EN,"['Start-up investment, investor decision making, cultural distance, personal distance.']",Business Development and Entrepreneurship,"Research focused on the effect of intercultural differences between investors and entrepreneurs in startup investment decision making has so far only considered cultural differences to be caused by differences in race, ethnicity or country of origin. This study argues that such a definition of culture is incomplete, and expands this concept by including the dimension of personal distance – described as differences related to thinking, value and communication – into the investment decision framework. Next to investigating the way in which the level of personal distance an investor perceives towards an entrepreneur affects their decision to invest, this study researches whether awareness of personal distance further influences this relationship. By means of an online experiment, a sample of Dutch business students were asked to evaluate the level of perceived personal distance towards a fictional entrepreneur and evaluate their decision to invest in his start-up. In this two-by-two between subjects design, participants where actively assigned to one of four conditions based on different levels of personal distance and awareness. Ultimately, this study accepts the hypothesis that perceived personal distance negatively affects the amount investors are willing to invest in a start-up, and that making investors explicitly aware of a low level of personal distance positively impacts this relationship. Further, this study shows indication of a similar, negative effect of perceived personal distance on the an investor’s likelihood of investment, but is not yet able to provide significant proof of such a relationship in light of a low sample size. The acceptance of two hypotheses results into strategical implications for entrepreneurs looking for start-up investment: they are encouraged to look for personally similar investors and highlight interpersonal similarities to increase their chances of receiving investment. On a theoretical note, this study calls for the including of personal distance as a dimension of cultural distance in the investment decision making framework, as well as revisiting the rejected hypothesis in a direct follow up study with an increased sample size."

This paper aims to investigate the relationship between non-fungible token and cryptocurrency. We want to know, weather non-fungible token and cryptocurrency are substitutes or complements. A review of the literature reveals, that this is not the first time that researchers attempt to analyse the relationship between NFTs and cryptocurrency however, this paper introduces a difference in difference methodology, which has never been used in this field before. Difference in difference is a statistical method used to establish solid cause and effect relationships. We can therefore say with confidence, that the results of this study depict a causal effect. The policy shock from the European Commission will show us, how the markets and in particular investors react to a changing sentiment in the crypto community. In previous studies, researchers believe to have found evidence of a complementary type of relationship between NFTs and cryptocurrency. The findings of this paper confirm these results and clearly show an increase in the number of buyers and an increase in sales volume, of selected non-fungible tokens after the shock."
The effect of Total Early-Stage Entrepreneurial Activity on Eudaimonic Well-Being1,"['Meer, Tom van der']","['Content, Jeroen']",2022-08-09T00:01:01Z,EN,"['udaimonic well-being, TEA, panel data, inverted U-shape']",Business Development and Entrepreneurship,"Panel data, consisting of data on 105 countries from 2005 till 2017, has been deployed to assess the effect of total early-stage entrepreneurial activity (TEA) and opportunity driven entrepreneurship on national levels of eudaimonic well-being (EWB). Additionally, moderation analyses were performed to determine whether corruption influences these relationships. Pooled OLS, fixed effects, random effects regression were used to test the hypotheses, plus some additional statistical procedures where necessary. Robust evidence was found in favour of an effect of TEA on EWB in the form of an inverted U-shape, with the maximum of EWB occurring at a TEA of 22,39%. No significant evidence was found supporting an effect of opportunity driven entrepreneurship on eudaimonic well-being, confirming findings from previous research. To explain these results self-determination, social comparison, and social contagion theory are utilised, hence, the economic questions were assessed through a psychological lens. Additionally, corruption did not moderate either of the relationships. Stimulating entrepreneurship levels within society has been found to increase GDP growth, however, there seems to be a limit to which stimulating entrepreneurship positively affects eudaimonic well-being. The contribution of the current research is providing a clearer picture regarding the effect of entrepreneurship on national well-being. The effect of TEA on national levels of EWB had, to the knowledge of the author, not been studied before."
Is green always better? The effect of renewables on the energy consumption of German households,"['Mahrholdt, Emanuel']","['Konda, Bruhan']",2022-08-09T00:01:00Z,EN,['Household energy consumption; Energy transition; Green electricity tariffs; Renewable rebound effect; endogenous switching regression; SOEP'],Economic Policy,"The adoption of green electricity tariffs is seen as one of the approaches to support the energy transition away from conventional to renewable energy sources. The anticipated environmental benefits of the tariff switch might nonetheless be mitigated by behavioral biases and counteracting effects, such as moral licensing and the renewable rebound effect. Using micro-data for 2020 from the German Socioeconomic Panel, this study explores the drivers behind the green tariff adoption by households and analyzes their resulting electricity consumption with an endogenous switching regression model. Our findings suggest that socioeconomic and attitudinal factors are mostly responsible for the adoption of green tariffs. The treatment effects for both adopters and non-adopters based on counterfactuals indicated higher consumption of electricity. Thus, the renewable rebound effect found support in this study and has to be accounted for when planning interventions in the field of energy policy."
Cultural distance and subsidiary performance in understudied countries,"['Peeters, Job']","['Kunst, Vincent']",2022-08-09T00:00:56Z,EN,['cultural distance; subsidiary performance; understudied countries; institutional \nquality'],International Management,"Since the last decades, multinational enterprises are increasingly opening up subsidiaries in 
regions outside of the Western world. These countries are different from the well-studied 
Western countries. The questions rises whether cultural difference affect the firm and the 
subsidiary in the same way in these countries. Starting from the theory of New Organizational
Institutionalism, the aim of this thesis is to research whether cultural difference in these lesser
studied countries has the same effect on the performance of subsidiaries as for the Western 
countries. By combining data on subsidiaries form Indian MNEs with the Hofstede-index, I 
analyzed the relationship. No significant relationship was found between the cultural 
difference and the subsidiary performance. Institutional quality was significant as a mediator. 
Having prior experience in the region did not serve as a mediator for cultural distance."
"Stocks, inflation, and market power.

In line with that, this work aims to identify whether companies' market power affects stock excess returns. Also, this research answers whether portfolios with different inflation hedging abilities perform differently and if investors 
would be willing to pay a premium on diversified portfolios with raised inflation exposure. These research questions are approached to be answered by conducting a time series regression analysis regarding stocks’ exposure to macroeconomic and microeconomic factors. The empirical findings suggest that, while stocks, on average, do not have a hedging ability against changes in inflation, selected stocks do. Also, regarding inflation exposure, market power does not affect stock excess returns. Additionally, portfolios with low inflation hedging abilities perform better than good inflation hedged portfolios. Lastly, creating an additional inflation risk factor in the asset pricing environment suggests that investors would be willing to pay a higher price for portfolios with a raised inflation exposure."
“Measuring the effects of the fluency of company names and tickers on the stock returns”,"['Szyll, Jakub']","['Walther, Thomas']",2022-08-09T00:00:58Z,EN,['Fluency; Investor recognition; Company names; Company tickers; Stock returns'],Banking and Finance,"Previous research in behavioral finance field shows that the fluency effect exists. In my thesis, I determine whether name and ticker fluency affect stock returns in any way. I find that stocks with fluent names and tickers do not yield higher abnormal returns relative to nonfluent stocks. I show that neither the name, nor the ticker fluency effect influences the stock returns significantly in the long run. Moreover, I show that after controlling for a large vector of company characteristics, as well as firm and time effects, the joint influence of name and ticker fluency on stock returns is statistically not significant. The presented results imply that investors are not able to exploit the fluency effect on stock returns. Furthermore, using event study analysis, I determine that a change of a company ticker to a more fluent one affects both the biggest and medium-sized companies’ stock abnormal returns positively in the short and the long run, leading to significant outperformance compared with the stocks that lowered their fluency levels when Carhart Four Factors and several firm and event characteristics are controlled for."

The main aim is to develop scientific didactics that contribute to both the literary development and the civic development of the pupil. It is also important to reduce the distance that has arisen between the school subject of Dutch and literary studies.
This educational design study consists of both a development and a validation study. In the first part, design principles are developed that form the basis for educational design in the form of teaching materials. In the validation study that follows, the teaching material is presented to an expert group of Dutch teachers and the editors of LitLab.
The main design principles are as follows: first of all, the literary texts should represent the ideological characteristics of the current era. In addition, the literary texts must be presented thematically and in context. This also applies to didactics, which in addition should be multidisciplinary, dialogical, multiperspectivistic and intermediate. Finally, it is important to integrate different language skills in the didactics.
Neoliberalism is central to the didactic design that has been developed on the basis of these design principles for validation. This theme is elaborated on on the basis of literary fragments from a recently published novel, a collection of poems and a short story. The digital LitLab format was used for this design, in particular to guarantee an intermediate and context-rich didactics.
The expert group and the LitLab editorial team identified the complexity of the material as a potential threat to the implementation of the design. Possible follow-up research in which the material is presented to a student population should support or refute this hypothesis."

Therefore, it is necessary to take a closer look at the experiences of effective service providers and understand whether platforms' current success masks the negative impacts. This paper aims to reveal the forms of value destruction in the subjective perceptions of gig workers. Qualitative data from 12 in-depth interviews with gig workers in the Dutch market showed that value creations happen at the expense of three cost types (physical, psychological, and financial). Combined with prior literature, interview findings contributed to the growing discussion around the hyper- capitalist and unfair nature of the platform business model by adopting a bottom-to-top approach. Findings provide theoretical and managerial implications, as well as potential discussions for further research."
"Do Individual Cultural Values Influence What Drives Job Satisfaction, and to What Extent?","['Bettencourt Calheiros e Meneses, Rosa']","['Boënne, Mathias']",2022-08-09T00:02:13Z,EN,['Job satisfaction; achievement recognition; promotion opportunities; trust in management; cultural values; multinational organizations.'],International Management,"The importance of finding appropriate ways to drive job satisfaction is paramount. Satisfied employees have been found to perform better and, consequently, contribute to organizations’ success. With growing globalization, multinational organizations increasingly struggle to find effective ways to deal with workforces in highly diverse cultural contexts. Using a field survey, the impact of three job characteristics – opportunities to grow within the company, achievement recognition and interpersonal trust (with regards to management) – on job satisfaction was measured, along with the moderating effect of cultural values, specifically individualism/collectivism and power distance. First, confirming past studies, a moderated multiple regression analysis showed that all three aspects of the job have a positive effect on job satisfaction, irrespectively of individual cultural values. Second, results presented evidence of an interaction between power distance and achievement recognition, showing that power distance negatively moderates the relationship between achievement recognition and job satisfaction. These findings have implications for modern-day managers and human resource practitioners who should consider power distance when dealing with multicultural teams, acknowledging that an approach such as achievement recognition will be more effective in increasing satisfaction in individuals with lower levels of power distance. The study integrates the culture factor with job satisfaction theory shedding light on how each job characteristic affects job satisfaction. This dive into cross-cultural variations extends existing research since cultural values are measured at the individual level rather than through a country- or regional-level generalization. Moreover, it analyses the effect of cultural values on the relationship between specific job characteristics and job satisfaction."

Specifically, with the development of the Alternative Model of Personality Disorders, the focus has shifted from a categorical approach to a dimensional approach, with attention on pathological personality traits and personality functioning. Additionally, research has focused on the benefits of gathering perspectives of multiple informants when assessing psychopathology. This study aimed to connect these developments, by examining the role of age in the association between parent-adolescent discrepancies in reports on pathological personality traits and adolescent-reported personality functioning. In a clinical sample, adolescents aged 14-24 (N=130), and their parents, filled in questionnaires on pathological personality traits (negative affect, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition and psychoticism) and personality functioning (self- and interpersonal functioning). Results indicated that levels of informant discrepancies were higher for internalizing personality traits, compared to externalizing personality traits. However, results showed no association between parent-adolescent discrepancies on pathological personality traits and adolescent-reported personality functioning. Additionally, there were no indications that age plays a role. Multiple explanations for these results were discussed. Future research that keeps in mind some of the limitations is recommended, as a better understanding of discrepancy in perceptions of parents and adolescents in personality pathology and its association with adolescent functioning will add to the ever-growing field of adolescent personality pathology and a more personal and dynamic approach."
"Closing Early Retirement Routes for Younger Female Partners : Evidence From The Abolishment of The State Pension Partner 
Allowance in The Netherlands","['Landman, Nienke']","['Huizen, Thomas van']",2022-08-09T00:02:10Z,EN,['pension reforms'],Economic Policy,"This study examines whether abolishing the state pension partner allowance in the 
Dutch pension system in 2015 contributed to the closing of early retirement routes for younger 
female partners. Until 2015, people with a younger partner who reached the state pension age got 
a partner allowance if their younger partner earned little or no income. The partner allowance can 
be seen as a stimulus to push retirement forward. By using a Differences-in-Differences design, 
this study estimates the effect of the pension reform on retirement decision-making, labour 
supply and training behaviour. The findings show no evidence that the younger female partners 
extended their retirement and remained active in the labour market. When focusing on the age 
gap and income, the findings only show a significant negative effect of the reform on labour 
supply for younger female partners with little or no income. Therefore, this study shows limited 
evidence for an effect of this pension reform and no evidence for a contribution to closing early 
retirement routes for younger female partners."
Using Blockchain Technology to Attract Funding for Nature-based Solutions,"['Slootman, Bas']","['Toxopeus, Helen']",2022-08-09T00:01:56Z,EN,['Nature-based Solutions; Blockchain; Sustainable Finance'],Business and Social Impact,"Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are natural solutions to societal problems. NbS offer a wide range of benefits to our society, such as climate adaptation and improvements for human health and wellbeing. Nonetheless, the solutions are not yet implemented on a large scale, mainly due to a lack of funding. This paper investigates in what ways blockchain technology can be used to overcome funding barriers that hinder the implementation of Nature-based Solutions. Qualitative research was conducted using a triangulation of data sources for robust and viable results. A framework was developed explaining the two blockchain-based mechanisms that are used to attract funding for NbS. Mechanism 1 uses blockchain to tokenize natural assets to improve their tradability, while mechanism 2 combines multiple technologies to monitor and maintain NbS more efficiently and transparently. The field is still emerging, and there are some limitations, but the outlook of using these mechanisms to increase funding for Nature-based Solutions is promising."

change, such as the time spent online, it creates a need to investigate whether negative consequences result from this. This study sought to examine the relationship between social media engagement, mindfulness, and Covid-19 related distress. Based on previous research, it was hypothesized that mindfulness would mediate the relationship between social media engagement and Covid-related distress in negative direction (hypothesis 1). Therein contained, it was expected to find a negative association between mindfulness and social media engagement; a negative association between mindfulness and Covid-19 related distress, and a positive relationship between social media engagement and Covid-19 related distress. Further, it was hypothesized that Covid-19 related perceived information overload (PIO, hypothesis 2a) and fear of missing out (FOMO, hypothesis 2b) would strengthen the relationship between social media engagement and Covid-19 related distress. The current study is characterized by a cross-sectional design which included 140 participants that were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (male = 83, M age = 36.42, SD = 11.89). The results support hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2b. The finding that mindfulness indeed acts as a mediator, points in the direction of developing mindfulness-based interventions that may effectively guide the way how social media should be approached to face less aversive affective outcomes. Further practical implications are to consider FOMO as a possible warning signal of subsequent Covid-19 related distress."
"Individual differences in posttraumatic stress symptoms in relation to a compromised autobiographical memory,

autobiographical memory deficits, notably overgeneral memory (OGM). Instead of being able
to recall specific autobiographical memories, people with PTSD seem to mainly retrieve
general events. Fifty-six severely traumatized patients completed the trauma questionnaire
PCL-5, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT)
in the present study. Contrary to the expectations, PTSD severity was not associated with
more overgeneral memory retrievals on the AMT. Next to this, the role of cue words valence
was investigated in the relationship between symptom clusters of PTSD and OGM. Also in
contrast with the expectations, high avoidance tendencies could not predict more
autobiographical overgenerality in response to the negative cue words of the AMT (Zheng, &
Gray, 2018). Neither did a high score on depressive symptoms, predict more OGM in
response to positive cues words (Mood Congruence Effects: Bower, 1983). These findings
suggests that, regardless of the difference in symptom severity or affective valence of a
preceding trigger, OGM was substantial. It may be that individual differences in PTSD and
depressive symptoms in clinical patients are poorly associated with differences in memory
specificity. The compromised specificity could only be evident when clinical patients are
compared with control patients. It is, however, hard to differentiate in AM complaints in a
group that is this severely traumatized. Future research could engage in more diverse
diagnostic groups so that the transdiagnosticity of OGM can be further examined."

In contrast: the convergence in unpaid tasks at home is occurring much slower. This research aimed to investigate whether explicitly talking about the division of unpaid tasks among couples would lead to a more equal division of household tasks and childcare. Since most research about this topic is done in a qualitative manner, this research expands earlier findings because it is done in a quantitative manner. The question was to what extent explicitly talking about the unpaid tasks does lead to a more egalitarian division of household tasks and childcare. The moderating role of women’s relative income during these conversations was also examined. For eight days, we conducted a diary study among Dutch parents (N = 142). Unexpectedly, talking about the division of unpaid tasks did not predict a more equal division of childcare and household tasks. Women’s relative income did also not moderate this relationship. Gender and relative income were significant predictors of the perceived division of childcare. Future research should focus on the desire of couples to divide the unpaid tasks equally and also look into within-person variance instead of solely between-person variance. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are also discussed in the current research."

In this global vision, to be able to outperform exceedingly, successful companies must focus on employee’s well-being by promoting supportive behaviors in a positive and safe climate. The importance to establish an inclusive culture, encourage leaders to empower followers and improve efficient cooperation in teams, are essential elements to nurture people’s wellness in the corporate setting. On this basis, the aim of this investigation is to analyse how empowering leadership and organizational inclusive culture relate each to well-being and how those relationships are influenced by the team’s process of collective mindfulness. One hundred fifty-eight working adults living in the Netherlands participated on the online survey. Results confirmed the existing positive relationships between empowering leadership, corporate inclusive culture, and well-being, meaning that the more the employees perceive their leaders as empowering as well as an established inclusive culture within the organization, the better they feel (hypotheses 1 and 2). Contrary to the expectations, collective mindfulness did not moderate those relationships, denoting that the existing direct associations are not statistically stronger for higher levels of collective mindfulness perceived (hypotheses 3 and 4). Although further quantitative studies on this subject are required to contribute more empirical evidence, those last two hypotheses must be rejected. Overall, the present findings remark the importance of creating an inclusive and safe atmosphere as well as motivating leaders in supporting and empowering followers to be able to foster people's well-being in the workplace."

Regression and bootstrap analyses were used to analyze the data. The regression analysis showed significant negative total and direct effects of attachment avoidance, but not attachment anxiety, on sexual assertiveness. Additionally, in contrast with the hypothesis, the following bootstrap analyses showed a significant negative indirect effect of attachment avoidance, but not attachment anxiety, on sexual assertiveness through body dissatisfaction. As such, higher levels of attachment avoidance were associated with higher body dissatisfaction, which was subsequently related to lower sexual assertiveness.

To stay focused on long-term goals and to ultimately achieve them, self-control is considered as a necessary capacity. While research within the topic of self-control strategies has mainly focused on intrapersonal strategies that people use to make progress towards achieving their goals, there has been little effort to integrate interpersonal strategies into the self-control literature. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine whether the relationship between trait self-control and goal progress is mediated by social support seeking. It was hypothesized that there is positive relationship between trait self-control and goal progress, which is mediated by social support seeking. An online questionnaire was used to conduct the research. Participants were recruited through social media and e-mail (N = 151). In line with the hypothesis, the results showed that trait self-control is positively related to goal progress, and this relationship is partially positively mediated by social support seeking. Two additional explorative analyses revealed that social support seeking for instrumental reasons partially mediated the relationship between trait self-control and goal progress, while this mediating effect was not found for social support seeking for emotional reasons. The current study sheds a different light on the understanding of how self-control operates and offers a foundation for developing methods for improving self-control. By continuing to investigate why people who have higher levels of self-control are more successful in attaining their goals, a more detailed understanding of the processes that are involved in self-control will be acquired."

Realising a Just Transition in the Dutch Crop Farming Sector and the Role of Organic Agriculture within this Transition,"['Rouhof, Stan']","['Akerboom, Sanne']",2022-08-16T00:01:18Z,EN,[],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Introduction
The Dutch crop farming sector and its widely utilised conventional agricultural practices contribute to 
global issues such as soil depletion, income inequality and poor working conditions, which clearly 
marks the need for a transition. Economic and environmental problems are frequently discussed but 
the notion of social justice within farming is often overlooked. Just Transition (JT) theory has 
extensively covered social justice topics within the energy sector but has not been applied to 
agriculture, a knowledge gap that this thesis addresses. (In)justices within the sector were identified 
and thereafter it was investigated how the injustices could potentially be overcome. Furthermore, 
organic agriculture (OA) is often praised for its performance on environmental and social indicators 
over conventional agriculture (CA). This thesis investigates what the role of organic agriculture is 
within the agricultural transition towards socially just practices.

Theory
Elkington’s (1997) Triple-Bottom Line was utilised to investigate the performance of OA compared 
to CA on environmental, economic, and social indicators. To identify (in)justices, the five most 
prevalent tenets of justice within JT theory, namely procedural, distributive, recognition, restorative, 
and cosmopolitanism justice, as well as eight justice principles created by Sovacool & Dworkin 
(2015) were utilised. 

Methods
A case study of the Dutch crop farming sector was utilised, whereby semi-structured interviews 
supported by additional desk research formed the data collection methods. Results were analysed 
using NVivo.

Results
The numerous identified injustices ranged from unequal financial and procedural power distributions 
negatively directed to farmers, to recognition issues and worldwide out-competing of local producers. 
Furthermore, OA has undeniable social and environmental benefits such as biodiversity- and soil 
preservation and strengthening the financial positions of farmers, alongside social projects like care 
farms. It also has some downsides such as the fact it requires higher land use, which is detrimental in 
the Netherlands where land is scarce. 

Discussion
The so-called Just Farming principles were created that guide with achieving socially just farming in 
countries with similar agricultural systems to the Netherlands. Limitations are answer biases, novelty 
issues and divergence of research questions. Future research possibilities include the application of JT 
in different sectors and bridging agricultural financial gaps. 

Conclusion
Identified (in)justices were summed up in a table and recommendations on how to overcome the 
injustices were given. Furthermore, OA should be practised more in the Netherlands and contributes 
to social justice in agriculture, but broader action is needed to meaningfully improve social justice 
within the sector"
lnstitutionalising Leaving No One Behind: a meta-analysis on worldwide national effort,"['Jong, Eileen de']","['Vijge, Marjanneke']",2022-08-16T00:01:11Z,EN,['Leaving No One Behind; Institutionalisation; Intersectionality; Policy Coherence; Policy Coordination'],Sustainable Development,"At the heart of the United Nations 2030 Agenda lies the pledge to ‘leave no one behind’ (LNOB). The real challenge of the LNOB principle lies within the translation into national policy frameworks which is open to broad interpretation (e.g., Fukuda-Parr & Hegstad, 2018). LNOB has no legally binding obligations and thus relies on much national leeway (e.g., Biermann, Kanie & Kim, 2017; Vijge et al., 2020). Although literature has widely researched LNOB and has urged for an integrated and cross- cutting approach, such an approach has not been reflected in research itself as it has been fragmented and narrow. In addition, a comprehensive analysis on the actual implementation of LNOB in countries is lacking. To fill up these theoretical and empirical gaps, this research has two objectives: i) to provide an overview of how the institutionalisation of LNOB can be analysed on a national level combining both scientific and policy literature and ii) to provide an (empirical) overview of how countries have (not) institutionalised LNOB. It will aim to answer the following question: What are the enabling (institutional) conditions and gaps for reaching LNOB in implementing the SDGs at the country level? 
To answer this question a triangulation of methods was used. First, a literature study was done to create a single framework representing how LNOB should be institutionalised. This framework consists of 29 institutional aspects divided over five broader institutional mechanisms: policy coordination, policy coherence, inclusive participation, disaggregated data, and dedicated finance. Second, this framework was used to do a meta-analysis of 77 VNRS published from 2016-2021 to analyse how countries have (not) institutionalised LNOB. Third, a correlation analysis was carried out to identify the interlinkages between mechanisms taking on a cross-cutting approach. 
The results revealed that the institutionalisation of LNOB shows many gaps, especially in terms coordination and financing. LNOB finds its way into VNR reporting and to some extent into policy making but when it comes to actual institutional structures and mechanisms to drive commitment or accountability clear gaps can be identified. Overall, countries show a lack of political commitment and will to institutionalise LNOB. The results also showed that the institutionalisation of LNOB is interlinked, but more research is needed to fully understand how this could create conducive conditions to reach LNOB. Some policy recommendations have followed from this research but what the ‘real’ impact is of LNOB on institutional structures of countries, which is crucial in understanding the progress on LNOB, remains uncertain at this point. The uniqueness of this research lies within the replicability of the analytical framework in other studies, which could be key in understanding how to best institutionalise LNOB and thus how to reach the LNOB principle."
Exploring regional patterns of scientific knowledge production on the Sustainable Development Goals,"['Ruesen, Ceder']","['Heimeriks, Gaston']",2022-08-16T00:01:24Z,EN,['complex knowledge production; SDG; Sustainable Development Goals; Knowledge complexity index; Scientific relatedness;'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"To address the pressing issues human overpopulation has created on earth, such as climate change and poverty, the United Nations (UN) introduced the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a global agenda to guide the world onto a more sustainable trajectory. To achieve the goals, the UN and scholars urge for local action, support, and collaboration of scientific research institutes. Additionally, embedding this structural transformation locally, requires new knowledge to address region specific challenges. Important in this process is to gain insights into the current knowledge base of regions, to find opportunities for new knowledge development. This study therefore aims to explain differences among European regions in complex knowledge production on SDG related research, specifically looking at the knowledge complexity of a region, it’s scientific relatedness to the SDGs, and several regional characteristics based on the SDG indicators. These concepts are drawn from literature on Evolutionary Economic Geography that argues that complex knowledge production is influenced by mechanisms of path- and place dependency. Using the CWTS wos_2113 database, scientific publications are retrieved that represent a region’s knowledge base. Data from the STRINGS project is used to identify SDG related publications. Findings show that North-Western Europe produces the most complex knowledge and has the highest relatedness to the SDGs. Following from this, four regression models are estimated, to find relationships between the variables. These models include data from before the introduction of the SDGs, 2010-2014, hereafter, 2015-2020, and with and without the inclusion of the regional characteristic variables, as these are only selected for a limited number of SDGs. The findings show that the SDGs are not equally well explained by the different variables, suggesting that there is not one model that fits all the SDGs. Nevertheless, for most SDGs a positive relationship is discovered between the knowledge complexity of regions and their scientific relatedness to the SDGs. This indicates that path- and place-dependent mechanisms also apply to the SDGs and proximity advantages should be considered. In addition, for the regional characteristic variables no general conclusion is drawn, as the indicators vary per SDG. However, surprising to see is that several SDGs show a negative relationship with the SDG research share, indicating that there is a misalignment between research priorities and societal needs. This study thus provides several promising insights and recommendations to expand the knowledge base of regions through research and collaboration, thereby aiming to accelerate the sustainability transition."
Implications of emission reduction target interaction on the conversion strategies of existing buildings to NZEB,"['Bernsen, Sam']","['Harmsen, Robert']",2022-08-16T00:01:15Z,EN,[],Energy Science,"Of all existing buildings that are currently in use, about 90% is estimated to still be in use by 2050. This creates urgency to convert existing buildings to NZEB in order to achieve international, national and regional energy reduction targets. For buildings there are short-term and long-term reduction targets set by governments which aim to reduce the energy consumption of existing buildings by a given year. This paper investigated how these targets can be met and if and how they interact when scenarios are drawn up to reach them. This was done by conducting a case study of the real estate portfolio of the KNAW (Royal Dutch Academy of Arts & Science), consisting of six different identifiably buildings, spread over five research institutes, in four different cities in the Netherlands. The research constructed two scenarios for these six buildings, setting up short-term scenario and a long-term scenario. Focusing respectively on short-term targets by implementing short-term scenario measures and long-term targets by implementing long-term scenario measures and focusing on regional policy such as the WTV (Transition Vision for Heat). The scenarios were constructed using building energy performance data, energy price predictions and energy conservation measure lists. With sensitivity analysis conducted on both energy prices and saving and cost parameters, the results from the study found negative interaction between the short-term and long-term targets for two of the six buildings under certain input parameters. These negative interactions resulted from the need for early depreciation of short-term measures when the implementation of long-term scenario measures needed to be executed."

We also discuss a simple symmetrical point cloud configuration in the plane that induces an indecomposable reducible representation on the barcode decomposition of a symmetric Delaunay complexes."
Your Waste Is Someone Else’s Dinner: Exploring the Role of Grassroots Initiatives in Combatting Food Waste in Utrecht,"['Koning, Yvette']","['Dittgen, Romain']",2022-08-16T00:01:14Z,EN,"['food waste, grassroots initiatives, food activism, social inequality, food access']",Sustainable Development,"Due to the enormous pressure of conflicts, climate change, and an increasing population, people face the consequences of not having access to healthy food. Simultaneously, the production of food, which uses heavy equipment, and high amounts of fossil fuels, water, synthetic fertilisers and synthetic pesticides, puts a huge burden on the environment itself. Yet, in a world where these problems of unsustainable food production and unequal food access exist, people still waste 390 million tonnes of food every year. This is problematic since food is not only thrown away but the resources that are used to produce, distribute and store them are wasted as well. There are however several grassroots initiatives that try to face these problems. Nonetheless, academic debates often do not include the potential of grassroots initiatives in overcoming food waste problems. Therefore, this research aims at filling in this knowledge gap by studying how three grassroots initiatives in Utrecht try to prevent food waste and measuring their impact. This is done through participant observation at different events of the three initiatives and by interviewing people that are involved in the grassroots initiatives. Additionally, people who work for the municipality are interviewed to show how food waste is put on the agenda by governmental bodies. It can be concluded that these initiatives try to reduce food waste by food and by preparing meals that would otherwise have been discarded. Through this, the initiatives do not only reduce food waste but also address issues around social inequality and social injustice. However, it can be argued that the impacts of grassroots initiatives are limited since they do not have the power to change whole food systems. Making alliances with other grassroots initiatives and with governmental bodies, such as the municipality of Utrecht, is therefore needed."

Abstract
Since the whole world is facing climate change caused by CO2 emissions there is need for sustainable development. This research focuses on the construction sector in the Netherlands since buildings are a large contributor to urban pollution. The paper specifies on high-rise ZEB development. In the long run high-rise buildings can form an opportunity to contribute to sustainable development and be a solution to the increasing housing  and office building shortage. This is currently not yet implemented on large scale. The construction sector is large and complex with a lot of different actors involved for each project. It is described as a traditional and conservative sector with low R&D expenditures. This research examens if this traditional character challenges the high-rise ZEB development by looking at the multiple institutional logics approach combined with the theory of institutional entrepreneurship. The results show a sector broad institutional field of risk averse behaviour, cost control, resistance to change, dispersed actor network and traditional regulation. These institutional logics form a stable and coherent system and challenges high-rise ZEB development because it is difficult to change a dominant stable system. However, some constructive logics including collaboration and experimentation arise. These are constructive since they are conflicting with the traditional set of logics. From the results another aspect came forward which appeared to be of quite large influence on the multiple institutional logics. These are labelled as the external factors including personnel shortages and increasing energy prices. The constructive logics in combination with the external factors are destabilizing the traditional logics and thereby creating opportunity for change. The opportunities of change can be used as starting point for institutional entrepreneurship which’s activities can be fulfilled by actors, actor groups or governmental organizations."

specialists. To add, sustainability and integrated reports provided additional validity. After gathering all the findings
from the qualitative data analysis and available literature 4 main social outcomes were identified: improvements and
protection for individual health, reshaping labour market through inclusivity and new employment creation, a greater
utility for society through additional choices or quality of circular products and responsible consumer behaviour, and
questionable fairness and ethicality of circular BM. To add, circular products might not be available for the majority
of society due to pricing. This research also includes several limitations including time constraints, possible bias,
sample size, and region. Despite the restrictions, this research might help future scholars to build systematic research
models and evaluate the outcomes not only in qualitative methods but also using a quantitative approach. To add, this
study could be considered as the starting point for circular companies while updating and creating their strategies and

"Quality of life measurements estimation from MRI data
in metastatic brain tumour patients","['Ansorena Lujambio, Eli']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-09-09T00:01:57Z,EN,[],Medical Imaging,"Brain metastases occur when tumour cells developed anywhere in the body spread to the brain. Radiotherapy (RT) is a treatment option for brain metastases that aims to eliminate the tumor cells within the brain, but it also causes healthy tissue damage that can lead to cognitive decline.
In order to measure the effects of different RT treatments on the patients, the quality of life (QoL) is measured to determine which one leads to the best cognitive outcome. For this purpose, tests with varying degrees of specificity, such as, neurocognitive assessment (NCA), patient reported outcome (PRO) and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) aim to quantify the cognitive change of the patients before and after RT. However, the high cost of NCAs, patient dependency of PROs and unreliability of KPS highlight the need for a new approach to measure the cognitive state of patients. Such novel approach could estimate the QoL of the patients solely based on anatomical markers from MRI scans, reducing costs and patient interactions alike. In order to develop such tool, the anatomical markers related to cognitive must be identified first.
In response, we performed a systematic review to analyse existing literature on the anatomical changes captured in MRI that have been linked to cognitive decline. We searched the Pubmed database where studies that evaluated cognitive change as a result of a specific anatomical change after RT were selected. Out of 298 publications, 16 were chosen, wherein tumor morphology, lesion number and location, peritumoral edema and necrosis were identified as the most relevant anatomical markers for the estimation of the QoL of brain metastatic patients based on MRI data.
We identified multiple limitations within our review regarding inhomogeneous patient cohorts, low-quality image processing and the lack of correlation between the anatomical changes and the effect that might have in the QoL of patients. Consequently, although the studies reviewed all reached similar conclusions, further research based on larger samples with more uniform patient cohorts and advanced imaging must be conducted, to be able to definitively quantify the effect these anatomical changes have in the QoL of patients after RT."

Firstly, this paper finds the main three drivers of SLE to be the positive social representations of entrepreneurship, the existence of entrepreneurial role models, and the perceived prevalence of entrepreneurship in Peru. Secondly, it finds that SLE affected the decision to become an entrepreneur in the sample by increasing their perceived desirability of entrepreneurship through three main mechanisms: by creating in them a positive awareness of the entrepreneurial career path, by enabling their entrepreneurial personality traits, and by increasing their readiness to participate in institutional support systems for entrepreneurship. Finally, the results are placed into an integrative model which adapts Krueger’s (2000) framework of entrepreneurial intentions, from theory of planned behaviour to better explain the findings in the sample."

These agreements are concluded through online platforms, leading to the expansion of the phenomenon called gig-economy. These flexible and goal-oriented jobs are questioning the “classic” employee role. Indeed, gig-workers experience issues as autonomy, financial instability, and condition of uncertainty, that previously characterized only the entrepreneurial career. The academic literature still tries to understand how these individuals should be considered, as some researchers are starting to refer to them as “microentrepreneurs”. This paper tries to add knowledge to this topic by analyzing their motivational traits in order to understand which academic opinion should be followed. The motivations that lead people to engage gig-working activities and their entrepreneurial psychological traits have been analyzed by this research in order to understand whether they own an entrepreneurial mindset or not. Taking a worker-centric approach, the results lead to the development of 4 different gig-worker profiles. Each category describes gig-workers’ motivations. Simultaneously, it verifies the entrepreneurial drivers identified by the literature about entrepreneur’s motivations. Findings shows that gig-workers perceive most of the entrepreneur’s drivers, however, their entrepreneurial mindset varies depending on which gig-working platform they engage. In fact, people that utilize Airbnb are more entrepreneurial than Temper users."

ingevuld in W9 en W10 (54.5% jongens, M leeftijd W 9 = 23.80, SD = 0,48, range 22 tot 26 
jaar). Beide richtingen zijn onderzocht met behulp van vier lineaire regressieanalyses. 
Resultaten: SCC in W9 blijkt geen unieke voorspeller te zijn voor positieve romantische 
relaties tijdens de jongvolwassenheid in W10. Andersom, is een positieve romantische relatie 
in W9 geen unieke voorspeller voor SCC in W10 bij jongvolwassenen. Wel bleken de 
regressiemodellen een significante variantie te verklaren en waren de covariaten significante 
voorspellers. Conclusie: Uit de resultaten van dit onderzoek wordt geen bi-directionele 
longitudinale wederzijdse relatie gevonden tussen een helder SCC en romantische relaties bij
jongvolwassenen in W9 en W10."
"Gamification Impact on Duration, User Engagement and Return rate for a Mobile Application.","['Zhuo, Clifton']","['Veltkamp, Remco']",2022-09-09T01:01:24Z,EN,[],Game and Media Technology,"Two models of the mobile application, Plants 4 Consumers, are compared in return rate, duration, and user engagement. The first model contains features such as virtual planting and recipe browsing. The second model contains all the features of the first model, but in addition, includes 3 mini-games, with inspirations from whack-a-mole, flappy bird, and minesweepers. For analysis, a comparison of dwell-time (duration), user engagement and return rate is drawn. The impact of the games’ factors was analysed with the GUESS questionnaire. The purpose of this project is to answer the questions: (i) Does gamification increase users’ duration, user engagement and return rate? (ii) Which key factors of gamification in the GUESS scale impacted the users’ duration, user engagement and return rate? And (iii) which key factors can be improved for future research? 30 participants (n=30) took part in the experiment. 15 participants took part in the non-gamified version of Plants 4 Consumers, and another 15 for the gamified version. Normality tests were conducted to find the distributions of each dataset, follow by inferential tests based on whether the datasets were normally distributed. Significant differences were found between the non-gamified and gamified in duration and return rate. No significance could be concluded in user engagement."
Natural Language Explanations,"['Niland, David-Paul']","['Gatt, A.']",2022-09-09T01:01:22Z,EN,"['Explainability, Explainable AI, XAI, Natural language explanations, natural language generation, Partial dependence, accumulated local effects, automl']",Artificial Intelligence,"This thesis is focused on generating natural language explanations for automated machine learning (AutoML). Research in natural language explanations is timely, given both the popularity of explainability techniques and the continued advances in AutoML. We believe that the standard explainability techniques are not explicit enough in conveying information to stakeholders. Users might prefer one mode of information over another or feel more confident with visual information. In other domains, people understand information better if it is presented in natural language. We have therefore proposed, developed and tested language generation modules that build explanations for machine learning models that can be applied to AutoML systems. This research provides a bedrock for future work on generating natural language explanations.

We have developed three language generation modules for permutation feature importance, partial dependence and accumulated local effects. During the development of the language generator modules, we conducted a preliminary pilot study to evaluate the systems. This study helped the development pro- cess and deepened our understanding of the language required to explain the graphical information. To test whether natural language explanations can offer more utility than visual explanations, we conducted a more extensive evaluation study to test which mode of explanation was more helpful: visual, textual or multimodal. What constitutes a ”good” explanation is one that helps users understand the underlying information that is being conveyed. In this thesis, study participants found multimodal explanations to be the most useful of the three modes in increasing their understanding of the underlying processes."
Teledruk bij verpleegkundigen,"['Vergeer, Femke']","['Tummers, L.G.']",2022-09-09T01:01:12Z,NL,['teledruk; verpleegkundigen; psychologische onthechting; burn-out; duurzame inzetbaarheid'],Publiek management,"Werkgerelateerde teledruk, de preoccupatie met, en drang om (zo snel mogelijk) te reageren op werkgerelateerde digitale berichten, kan negatieve effecten hebben op het welzijn en de prestaties van werknemers.

In dit onderzoek beantwoord ik daarom de vraag: Hoe ervaren verpleegkundigen het gebruik van online communicatiemiddelen voor het communiceren over roosterproblemen, welke factoren hebben effect op teledruk volgens verpleegkundigen en welke maatregelen treffen verpleegkundigen om teledruk te verlagen? Om een antwoord te geven op deze onderzoeksvraag heb ik semigestructureerde interviews gehouden met verpleegkundigen en leidinggevenden van verpleegkundigen in een breed scala aan zorgorganisaties. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat twee derde van de geïnterviewde verpleegkundigen teledruk ervaart. Daarnaast beschrijf ik een aantal factoren die teledruk volgens de respondenten verhoogt en presenteer ik maatregelen die de respondenten treffen om teledruk te verlagen. Deze factoren en maatregelen vormen mogelijk een opzet voor vervolgonderzoek naar manieren om teledruk bij werknemers te verlagen. Op basis van het onderzoek beveel ik leidinggevenden van (zorg)organisaties aan om verwachtingen rondom online communicatie duidelijk te communiceren en een gezond werkklimaat te creëren. Ook raad ik werkgevers aan werknemers die op basis van de genoemde factoren extra gevoelig zijn voor teledruk in bescherming te nemen. Aan werknemers beveel ik ten slotte aan de genoteerde maatregelen te gebruiken als inspiratie."

De afgelopen decennia maakt toerisme een grote groei door. Wereldwijd, maar ook in Nederland, stijgt het aantal toeristische bezoeken en recreatieve activiteiten. Deze groei brengt veel economisch gewin met zich mee, maar ook een aantal negatieve effecten. Veel bestemmingen zijn (nog) niet goed voorbereid op de grote toename van de toeristische sector. Hierdoor ontstaan er op een aantal bestemmingen problemen gerelateerd aan toerisme, waardoor de leefomgeving onder druk komt te staan. Een van de bekendste voorbeelden is misschien wel het overvolle Venetië, waar oorspronkelijke bewoners door alsmaar hoger wordende prijzen worden weggedreven. Maar ook dichter bij huis, bijvoorbeeld in Amsterdam en Giethoorn, zien we negatieve effecten van toerisme. Om die reden is er toerismebeleid nodig.
In de wetenschap gaven de gevolgen van de wereldwijde toeristische groei redenen om toerisme anders te bekijken. Waar voorheen toerisme vanuit economisch perspectief benaderd werd, komt er de laatste jaren steeds meer aandacht voor de benadering die duurzaam toerisme genoemd wordt. Hierbij is er naast oog voor de economische kant, net zo veel aandacht voor ecologische en sociaalmaatschappelijke aspecten van toerisme. Deze nieuwe benadering heeft in de wetenschap tot een paradigmaverschuiving geleid en wint steeds meer terrein. Echter is er over de definitie van duurzaam toerisme nog geen consensus en blijkt het bereiken daarvan moeilijk.
In Nederland hebben het NBTC en de Rli in 2019 een doorvertaling van de duurzame benadering van toerisme gegeven met de visie Perspectief 2030 en het adviesrapport Waardevol Toerisme. Er wordt hierin opgeroepen om in heel Nederland toerisme anders te gaan benaderen en tot een perspectiefverschuiving te komen. Toerismebeleid kan toerisme in goede banen leiden, zodat uiteindelijk iedere Nederlander van toerisme kan profiteren en de lusten en lasten overal in balans zijn. De overheden worden opgeroepen zelf aan de slag te gaan met een lokale doorvertaling hiervan.
Door de coronapandemie kent de paradigmaverschuiving naar duurzaam toerisme een extra dimensie. Er is een discussie opgelaaid, ook bekend als de ‘war on tourism’, waarbij het ene kamp bepleit dat dit het momentum is voor het doorvoeren van duurzame hervormingen, terwijl het andere kamp vindt dat dit niet van een zo hard getroffen sector gevraagd kan worden en er juist oog voor economisch herstel dient te zijn. Hierdoor lijkt de paradigmaverschuiving naar duurzaam toerisme een stap terug in de tijd te zetten, waarbij het economische perspectief weer meer aandacht krijgt. De vraag rijst in hoeverre men op gemeentelijk niveau al bezig is met deze paradigmaverschuiving welke factoren hierop van invloed zijn. De vraag die in dit onderzoek beantwoord wordt luidt dan ook: ‘Welke rol speelt de wetenschappelijke paradigmaverschuiving naar duurzaam toerisme op gemeentelijk beleidsniveau in Nederland en welke factoren hebben hier invloed op?’
Door het analyseren van Perspectief 2030 en Waardevol Toerisme en het interviewen van beleidsmedewerkers toerisme en recreatie in twintig Nederlandse gemeenten, kan antwoord op deze vraag gegeven worden. Op gemeentelijk niveau wordt er steeds vaker toeristisch-recreatief beleid ontwikkeld. In vrijwel alle gemeenten valt toerisme onder economie, wat de insteek van het toeristisch-recreatief beleid redelijk economisch van aard maakt. Daarnaast speelt de toeristische situatie in de gemeente een grote rol bij het al dan niet opstellen van beleid. Gemeenten met grotere afhankelijkheid van de toeristische sector voelen meer urgentie om beleid op te stellen. Gemeenten waarin weinig toerisme is, voelen deze urgentie minder. De prioriteit die in een gemeente aan toerisme wordt gegeven bepaalt dus sterk de aandacht die er in beleid voor toerisme is."
Post-graduation mobility of international students and the factors influencing it during the pandemic: a study of Chinese students in the Netherlands,"['Jiang, Chuyin']","['Cortinovis, Nicola']",2022-09-09T01:04:54Z,EN,[],Human Geography,"The introduction of the thesis sets well the ground for the research, showing the relevance and making connections to policy and academic debates. The theory section is also well developed, covering the existing literature in a systematic and cohesive way. Gaps in the existing literature (e.g. boing beyond the binary choice, feeling of belonging, COVID) are highlighted and discussed. From the theoretical framework, a good conceptual model is derived. At the same time, hypotheses 2 and 3 are not very clear and in general do not play a great role in the thesis.
Methodologically, the thesis is reasonably solid. The data collection led to a good number of responses collected and the quantitative and qualitative methods are well mixed, each section of the empirical analysis reinforcing the other. Very good choices of quotes from the interviews. Some considerations with respect to social desirability of given answers and the choice of the medium (WeChat) leading to possible bias should have been considered. The formatting and presentation of the data is essential and to the point. Graphs and other visualizations could have given a stronger impact.
The conclusions are good and show the ability of Chuyin to both summarise the findings, connect to the literature and societal issus as well as to discuss (some) of the limitations of the thesis.
Chuyin demonstrated good level of autonomy and ownership, especially by coming up with the research topic alone and manage very well throughout the trajectory of the thesis."
"Dutch, English and Everything in Between: Scenarios of the Interplay of Language Policies and Practices in Participatory Bodies at Utrecht University","['Bijl, Annick van der']","['Schneider, Carolin']",2022-09-09T01:04:55Z,EN,[],Interculturele communicatie,"This thesis analyses the current language policies and practices of Utrecht University’s
participatory bodies. More specifically, it uses the term linguistic scenarios; therefore, its main
research question is: which linguistic scenarios are currently present within the employee and
student representation of Utrecht University? This issue is highly relevant because a new,
multilingual Dutch/English language policy was recently approved by the University Council.
Hence, Utrecht University will have to find the best way to deal with multilingualism in its
employee and student representation in the coming years. In order to provide an overview of the
current situation, this study took a qualitative approach. Firstly, focus group interviews with
Dutch and international participants from various faculties, departments, and participatory bodies
were organised; secondly, the transcripts of these interviews were examined through Keyword in
Context (KWIC) analysis and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). The results of this analysis
presented the following five linguistic scenarios: 1) a strict monolingual Dutch policy; 2) a Dutch
preferential policy; 3) a strict monolingual English policy; 4) an English preferential policy; 5) a
multilingual Dutch/English policy. Furthermore, these language policies and practices are
characterised by the way in which different linguistic tools and services that support participation
are made available. Finally, it was found that these scenarios had a significant influence on the
inclusion and exclusion of Dutch and international representatives at Utrecht University."
Why are Companies Moving Back Home? An investigation into the drivers of location choice in the European apparel industry,"['McFerson, Tory']","['Rietbergen, Ton van']",2022-09-09T01:04:41Z,EN,[],Human Geography,"As a result of globalization, many firms have chosen to offshore value chain activities in the apparel industry. However, there is an increasing trend of moving manufacturing closer to home. Supply chain disruptions, demand volatility and an increasing pressure on sustainability has made many managers of global value chains consider reshoring or nearshoring segments of their supply chain. Reshoring refers to moving previously offshored production back to the country of the parent company. Closely related to this term is nearshoring, which involves moving production closer to the country of the parent company. This thesis investigates the various drivers of location choice within the European apparel industry. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight participants involved in the European apparel industry or the reshoring and nearshoring phenomena. The interviews attempt to uncover the different decision-making processes and perceptions of these trends within the industry. The analysis shows that firms consider both supply-side factors and consumer expectations when making location decisions. Control and speed of production may drive location choice from the supply side, while the increasing consumer preference for local products is driving location decision from the demand side. The pursuit of more sustainable practices can influence the location choice for apparel firms, although this is mainly through the consumer’s perceived notion of sustainability. A limitation associated with this research is the lack of individuals interviewed with direct decision-making power on the location choices of apparel firms. However, the aim of this thesis is not to provide one answer to the drivers of location choice. Instead, this is an attempt to understand the various positions within the industry on this highly relevant topic."

We extend this single-pass decoupled look-back scan to support irregular segmented scans, where we scan over a ragged array using a separate array with flags. This is then implemented into the Accelerate framework, a framework for parallel array

Artistieke ensembles en historische handelingen. Een analyse van de bijdrage van de kunstenaar Antoon Molkenboer aan de Nederlandse studentenmaskerades in het begin van de twintigste eeuw.,"['Beerse, Frédérique']","['Stolwijk, Chris']",2022-09-09T02:02:36Z,NL,"['Maskerade, studentenmaskerade, Antoon Molkenboer, negentiende eeuw, twintigste eeuw, toegepaste kunst, artistieke ensembles, ensemblefeesten, lustrum, lustrumfeesten, optocht, historische handeling, living history, kostuums, studenten, Groningen, Leiden, Utrecht, Delft.']",Kunstgeschiedenis,"Gedurende de negentiende en vroege twintigste eeuw organiseerden de Nederlandse studentenverenigingen in Groningen, Leiden, Utrecht en Delft ter gelegenheid van de lustra van hun respectievelijke universiteiten grote maskerades. Hierbij werden historische optochten nagedaan met zoveel mogelijk aandacht voor de veronderstelde historische werkelijkheid. Deze optochten groeiden al snel uit van kleine optochten in gehuurde kostuums naar enorme meerdaagse spektakels met kostuums die zo accuraat mogelijk werden nagemaakt en feestzalen die zeer precies in de juiste stijl werden gedecoreerd.
De keuze van het onderwerp van de maskerade was aan mode en de voorkeur van de verschillende universiteiten onderhevig, maar de opzet van de maskerades bleef in de basis gelijk. De studenten dede gedegen onderzoek naar de context van het historische moment dat zij gekozen hadden om na te spelen. Door de resultaten van dit onderzoek vorm te geven en aan de inwoners van de presenteren in de optocht, wer de band tussen de studenten, burgers en universiteit versterkt. Hierbij gingen de wens voor spektakel en historische getrouwheid vaak hand in hand, maar werkten elkaar ook dikwijls tegen.
Aan het eind van de negentiende eeuw werd de wens voor het spektakel steeds groter, waardoor vaker kunstenaars werden ingeschakeld om te helpen met de artistieke vormgeving van het geheel. De kunstenaar wiens invloed hierbij het verst strekte, was Antoon Molkenboer. Naar aanleiding van de Utrechtse maskerade van 1901 schreef hij een artikel over de manier waarop de maskerade nieuw leven ingeblazen kon worden en in 1903 kreeg hij in Delft de kans om zijn ideeën in de praktijk te brengen. Na het succes van de Delftse maskerade werd hij in 1904 uitgenodigd om te helpen in Groningen en in 1905 in Leiden. Zijn maskerade-loopbaan sloot hij af in Delft in 1913, nadat hij in 1911 ook in Utrecht had geholpen.
Molkenboer verschilde van de andere kunstenaars die hielpen bij de vormgeving van andere maskerades. Niet alleen liet hij zich niet beperken tot één stad, maar hij bemoeide zich naast de productie van de kostuums ook met de decoratie van de feestzaal en het ontwerpen van het gedenkalbum. 
In het artikel van 1901 richtte hij zich met name op de productie van de kostuums. Die moesten ontworpen en geproduceerd worden niet als afzonderlijke kostuums, maar als één artistiek geheel. Dit geheel zou naar een hoger plan worden getild en beter tot zijn recht komen wanneer de kostuums ook tegen een achtergrond gezien konden worden die in stijl overeekwam met de uit te beelden periode. Daarom trok hij naast de kostuums ook het ontwerpen van de decoratie van de feestzaal naar zich toe, of de studenten dit hem nu gevraagd hadden, of niet.
Molkenboers vroege maskerades werden positief ontvangen en zijn pogingen om een artistiek geheel te creëren waren, volgens de pers, goed geslaagd. Bij de laatste twee maskerades was de publieke opinie echter veranderd. Naast complimenten over de historische getrouwheid van de kostuums en het spektakel van het geheel, klonken er stemmen op die een dergelijke vertoning niet langer vonden aansluiten op de eigentijdse smaak. Het contrast tussen de gekostumeerde studenten en de burgers was te groot geworden.
In de tien jaar tussen 1903 en 1913 kreeg Antoon Molkenboer de kans zijn artistieke ideeën op grote schaal vorm te geven. Hij bouwde niet alleen voort op kennis die hij al bezat, maar kwam dankzij de maskerades ook in aanraking met mozaïekkunst en glas-in-lood, twee media waar hij later veelvuldig gebruik van zou maken. Gedurende tien jaar ontwikkelde Molkenboer zich als een zelfstandige, zelfverzekerde en zakelijke kunstenaar. Hij ging meer vertrouwen op zijn eigen kennis en kunde, trok meer taken naar zich toe en nam controle over de vormgeving van zijn artistieke ideeën."

This is facilitated through an analysis of the theatre production of Ibsen House by Simon Stone which constitutes central themes of trauma and memory. Within the context of performance, my research assembles ways of sensing, relating, and understanding to mediate different knowledge forms and develop capacities for empathic thought. My argument is that an affective presencing can further a sense of social-political consciousness, as exemplified through my analysis of Ibsen House. The impetus for this research is ecological, in that it proposes a way of thinking about our interconnectedness as entities and our positions within dominant social orders. A core analytical framework is that of affect, as per the work of Lauren Berlant, in that the thesis abides by certain beliefs as to how crisis is encountered and contemplated: first by affect, then by thought, but also simultaneously. This study comprises four outlooks that guide: first, to study the infrastructure of trauma through the environment; second, to understand the spectatorship of the wound through its relational presence; third, to locate the mediation of traumatic affects through instinctual responses; and fourth, to develop an ecological perspective of Ibsen House by situating presencing observations along existent research in the field of trauma studies."
The Development of Roman Imperial Titles from Julius Caesar to Trajan and its implications,"['Favrin, Alessandro']","['Stevens, Saskia']",2022-09-09T02:02:18Z,EN,['emperorship;imperator;princeps;Augustus;Caesar;Roman;'],"Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance Studies","This thesis explores the four terms most closely associated with what modern historians would call the emperorship, to determine Roman perspectives on who ruled the Roman world. The terms imperator, princeps, Augustus and Caesar are analysed, both in their official usage on coins and inscriptions and their unofficial use in works of literature. The focus in the analysis lies on the nature of the term - whether it is used as a title, a general term, or a name - and the meaning of the term in its particular context. This approach has been chosen to take into account both how the government presented itself and how it was viewed by its upper-class subjects. Furthermore, by tracking the linguistic evolution of these terms chronologically, it is possible to relate their development to the development of Roman rulership. In fact, using these methods it is possible to demonstrate a relationship between the development of Roman absolute rulership, known in modern historiography as emperorship, and the development of these terms into titles. As this thesis shows, the transition between Republic and Empire was a process that took long enough for contemporaries not to grasp the extent of change that for us is now evident. Not only that, the linguistic evolution, especially of the terms imperator and princeps, can be used to show that Roman rulership underwent great development during the first century. This evidence can then also be used to argue, that the term emperor has perhaps outlived its usefulness as an umbrella term, and that we need to be more sensitive to Roman perspectives on their own leadership."

This method is particularly beneficial for mod- elling international relations and the relations between smaller places. However, it also suffers from potentially introducing space-language bias into the networks. This paper creates a network of 151 European cities derived from English and French versions of Wikipedia using toponym co-occurrence analysis to be used as a case study. City-pairs in the English and French language sphere are found to have a tendency to be over-represented in the respective data sources compared to the patterns expected from gravity modelling. Nevertheless both of the resulting networks fit expected patterns, showing the applicability of toponym co-occurrence analysis."
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 using perovskites stabilized with UiO-67,"['Brink, Robin van den']","['Hutter, E.M.']",2022-09-09T02:02:16Z,EN,['Photocatalysis;perovskites;CO2 reduction; UiO-67; MOF'],Nanomaterials Science,"The effects of CO2 in our air have been widely researched and the way we are generating energy
and producing materials at this moment is unsustainable. A way to mitigate the CO2 that is
pumped into our atmosphere is to find a way to commercially convert itinto fuels or valuable
chemicals, such as CO and CH4, that can be used in our economy. Lately solar fuels have been
getting some attention.. They can be formed by using artificial photosynthesis which is based on
the reaction that plants have been performing and perfecting for millennia.

Since CO2 is a very stable molecule, catalysts are used to enhance its conversion by minimizing
the energy needed in order for the reaction to take place . One of the promising catalysts that
has been researched are perovskites. Due to their ionic nature and small bandgap they are ideal
for photocatalytic conversion. In this research, CsPbBr3 was used as a catalyst to reduce CO2 into
CO and CH4. However because CsPbBr3 contains lead which is toxic and harmful for the
environment, lead free Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite was explored as well.

One of the serious drawbacks of perovskites is their instability in ambient atmosphere and
aqueous solutions. To make them more stable the molecular organic framework UiO-67 was
used to cover the perovskite crystals. UiO-67 is a very stable molecule in aqueous environments
and also has good CO2 adsorption capabilities which will help to increase the reduction activity.
The synthesis of this UiO-67 crystal was optimised by changing reaction conditions and ratios of
starting products. This resulted in a repeatable synthesis to make mesoporous structures with a
high BET surface area.

To test the perovskites they were spin coated on top of a borosilicate wafer and placed in a
photocatalytic cell. For the combined sample the UiO-67 layer was coated over the perovskite
layer forming a heterojunction. H2 and CO2 gas were lead over the sample and the products
were analysed with a continuous GC.

To analyse the catalysts XRD, IR, Ar-physisorption, TEM and SEM were used
Pure CsPbBr3 was not unambiguously proven to be photo catalytically active but when UiO-67
was added it did catalyse the reduction of CO2 to CO. Pure Cs2AgBiBr6 was not active. However
when adding H2O to the reaction mixture Cs2AgBiBr6 did become active."

In this context, the European Union has taken to employing civilizational rhetoric as well, with official references to a ‘European way of life’ as a separate policy area and ‘systemic rivals’ as a label for powerful states which undermine the human rights based system promoted by the EU. This has occurred alongside calls for European strategic autonomy and the declaration of a ‘geopolitical’ European Commission. This thesis argues that the construction of a civilizational narrative for the European Union serves the goal of fostering a foreign and security policy more independent from the United States, the delineation of boundaries with countries identified as threats to the EU’s values on an international scale, such as China, and of pushing back against the narrative promoted by Vladimir Putin’s Russia over Ukraine."

a series of randomly generated models as well as Ising and Potts models. The
Gibbs with Gradients sampler is compared against the Gibbs sampler, and we
empirically show that while Gibbs with Gradients decreases the autocorrelation
of draws, the additional computational cost causes it to have a lower effective
sample size per second, making it worse in practice."

Het Bouwcentrum is in een hoog tempo ontwikkeld en is in vier fases gegroeid tot een groot complex. De eerste twee gebouwen zijn ontworpen door Joost Boks en zijn in 1949 en 1956 geopend. Bij de derde en vierde fase werkte Boks samen met Wout Eijkelenboom en Bram Middelhoek in Bureau Boks Eijkelenboom Middelhoek. Bij de vierde (en dus laatste) fase was Boks enkel raadgevend architect. Alle gebouwen die bij dit complex horen vormden een eenheid met elkaar. 

Er is weinig over de Bouwcentrumgebouwen geschreven. Zeker over hoe de verschillende gebouwen te duiden zijn is weinig te vinden. Vaak wordt in de literatuur enkel gefocust op het eerste en eventueel het tweede gebouw, maar de rest van het complex wordt vaak overgeslagen. Daarom wordt in deze scriptie onderzoek gedaan naar de verschillende gebouwen en hoe deze te duiden zijn. Dit is gedaan door de ambities van de opdrachtgevers (met name van Van Ettinger) te analyseren, de gebouwen te vergelijken met het oeuvre van de architecten (Boks, Eijkelenboom en Middelhoek) en door de gebouwen te plaatsen in de ontwikkelingen in de bouwwereld. 

Hiervoor zijn verschillende boeken en tijdschriften geraadpleegd. Ook is er gebruik gemaakt van het Boks-archief in Het Nieuwe Instituut en het Bouwcentrum-archief in het Nationaal archief. Er is een analyse gemaakt door onderzoek te doen naar de opdracht, de ontwerpfase, de gerealiseerde gebouwen, de constructie en de plattegronden. Uit dit onderzoek is gebleken dat de gebouwen vaak kenmerkende elementen van Boks’ architectuur bevatten en dat de ambitie van Van Ettinger een grote rol speelde bij de ontwikkeling van het Bouwcentrumcomplex. Bij de ontwikkeling van het complex werd rekening gehouden met dat de gebouwen een eenheid moesten vormen. Daarvoor moesten ze in materiaal, kleur en maatvoering bij elkaar aansluiten. Bij elke nieuwe uitbreiding veranderde de indeling van de gebouwen, omdat bepaalde functies verschoven werden. De ontwikkeling van het Bouwcentrumcomplex laat dan ook goed de ontwikkeling van het Bouwcentrum als instituut zien."
Obesity and breast cancer: Linking inflammation to aromatase activity in cancer progression and therapy resistance,"['Ronach, Jasmin']","['Kalkhoven, E.']",2022-09-09T03:01:00Z,EN,['breast cancer; obesity; estrogen signaling; aromatase; cancer immune response; macrophages; PGE2'],"Cancer, Stem Cells and Developmental Biology","Breast cancer affects an increasing number of women every year, and a major risk factor for this disease is obesity.  I studied the connection between breast cancer progression and an obese microenvironment in ER+ breast cancer, which requires estrogen to grow. For one, consumption of energy and nutrients in excess of what is required by the body helps to fulfill a growing tumor's high energy demands. At the same time, accumulation of fat tissue not only allows for storage of excess energy, but also forms an endocrine tissue, providing hormones and growth factors that support tumor growth. Another way in which I found that obesity supports a tumor is by creating a chronic state of inflammation in the body. The tumor can manipulate the inflammatory environment to hide from the immune system, grow blood vessels, invade other tissues, and eventually spread to other organs. One type of immune cell called macrophages is found in the tumor environment and seems to produce a compound called PGE2, which stimulates the activity of aromatase. This enzyme plays an important role in the synthesis of estrogens. Based on my findings, I believe that obesity assists the cancer in sustaining an inflammatory environment full of macrophages releasing PGE2. High amounts of this compound then lead to stimulation of aromatase, and synthesis of greater amounts of estrogen. The tumor can use these estrogens to grow and progress to a more advanced stage. This knowledge can help us to discover more effective future treatments. Currently, breast cancer patients usually receive a primary treatment coupled with hormone therapy, which targets for example aromatase to disrupt estrogen synthesis and prevent cancer growth. However, many women are already therapy-resistant or become therapy-resistant over time, leading to a high potential for future relapse. More research is needed into the mechanisms behind resistance to aromatase inhibitors and other hormonal treatments. Additionally, factors such as a patient's weight, metabolic health, and potential inflammation, should be taken into account when conducting a risk assessment in the clinic, seeing as obesity has been linked to a greater breast cancer risk and cancer progression."
"Intergenerational Transmission of Fatherhood Norms: Investigating the Entanglements Between Fatherhood, Masculinity, and Memory","['Johnson, Frankie']","['Olivieri, Domitilla']",2022-09-09T03:00:58Z,EN,['fatherhood; masculinity; memory; care;'],Gender Studies,"In recent years, academic literature has indicated an expansion of understandings of masculinity and fathering in contemporary Western society, shifting from hegemonic masculinity (Connell, 1980s) towards ‘caring masculinity’ (inspired by the concept of universal caregiver, Fraser, 1977; developed by Elliott, 2016, amongst others). Despite the enthusiasm surrounding the latter’s emergence, critics have both challenged the temptation to overly simplify these ideas into a ‘new’ vs ‘traditional’ father (Dermott); and questioned whether ‘involved fathering’ (key characteristic of caring masculinity) is more cultural ideal than material reality, with such fathering potentially representing re-creations of patriarchal dominance in new guises (Hearn, Gatrell, Ranson amongst others).

This research seeks to introduce the study of memory to this intersection between fatherhood and masculinity studies, in order to test the academic hypothesis of a shift in fatherhood model by investigating the prevalence of fatherhood norms within the Netherlands - specifically the influence of childhood memory in their intergenerational transmission. In other words, researching how an individual’s memory of the experience of being fathered shapes the parameters of their own engagement with, and/or adoption of, fatherhood norms, and how this ties in with their understanding, performance, and valuation of masculinity.

This research adopts an hermeneutic-phenomenological methodology, and a mixed-methods research design incorporating a survey (in Dutch) followed by semi-structured interviews (in English) to contextualise survey findings through personal stories, focusing more explicitly on childhood memories.

The goal of this research is to understand how fatherhood norms are remembered and to what extent these are transferred, in order to break negative fathering cycles in the advance towards gender equality."

Using the concept of somatechnics, this thesis highlights why this is the case. Moreover, it provides suggestions for a more somatechnically aware pedagogy for online lectures. Firstly, the dispositif of the students partaking in emergency online education will be discussed.

Since then, numerous suggestions on how to arrange the relationship between the two partners have been brought up. The economic consequences of these policy options are usually well-researched, but much less so their political feasibility in the Swiss and the EU political arena. The paper at hand closes this research gap by assessing the political feasibility of scenarios for the prospective Switzerland-EU relationship with help of the veto player theory. By linking both political feasibility and economic aspects of nine empirically identifiable scenarios, the continuation of the Bilateral path in conjunction with vertical institutional integration turns out to be the most promising way to advance the Switzerland-EU relationship. My results highlight the relevance of political feasibility considerations in analysing policy problems. A mere economic analysis often misses the mark and fails to render a complete picture. If expanded with a political feasibility analysis, the expected value of a policy option becomes much clearer."

Using a historical institutionalist analysis, the thesis demonstrates that a crisis of legitimacy of the welfare state in the 1980s caused the Dutch government to embark on a neoliberal path of reducing state influence in all areas of society, including housing. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and State Secretary Enneüs Heerma, the social rental sector was reduced from a universal provision to a safety net for only lower incomes. Housing corporations were privatised and cut off from state support. Protests against the reforms were organised under the slogan “Heerma, Not Like This!”, but resistance failed to materialise in parliament, where a majority of political parties supported the reforms. This was, among other reasons, because Heerma showed no willingness to divert from his chosen path and presented the reforms as a necessity, causing legislators to fail to see alternatives."

With patronage becoming increasingly important for the art and culture sector and the lack of research regarding present day women patrons in the Netherlands, a discourse analysis was performed. Incorporating the results from the discourse analysis performed on the case studies De Moderne Mecenas and Ik ben ook mecenas, this thesis found that agency and elitism merge as the defining characteristics of the discourse around the present day woman patron. The discourse analysis reveals that the present day woman patron claims agency through narration, the care and rights perspective and, simultaneously, troubles the public/private split. In addition, the elite position the present day woman patron takes on in our society is explored through economic, social, cultural and symbolic capital and mystification as a tool. In sum, it was found that the present day woman patron claims agency through her art patronage, but does not subvert the entire order of the art patronage community. However, by being a woman patron she does trouble the order from within by showing that art patronage is not necessarily ascribed to men. In addition, by exploring the underlying processes of the different forms of capital and mystification which the present day woman patron uses to legitimise her social position, the membership of the present day woman patron of the elite art patronage community was established."

This research on discourse analysis focuses on the 2022 Ukrainian war to explore what are the causal logics and mechanisms that are responsible for policy change during critical junctures, and which led to the revolutionary joint belief shift of becoming energy independent from Russia.

With the help of Discourse Network Analysis and semi-structured interviews with EU officials, this paper offers a relevant selection of primary and secondary data sources to comprehensively elucidate how involved actors’ discourses and sets of beliefs on EU energy policy have changed over time around the subject. This empirical approximation, therefore, allows to thoroughly map actor’s congruence and affiliation networks, with the logic of identifying dominant discourses throughout three phases –from September 2021 to July 2022.

Findings in this research rightfully show that, for the 2022 Ukrainian war, players involved in EU energy policy were capable, in the end, of modifying their beliefs and embracing new and innovative ideas in favour of energy independence from Russia. For this to happen, important political (and symbolic) events and initiatives were needed in order to activate a novel joint belief shift at the heart of the EU. Likewise, these actors successfully convinced more and more players in favour of this, making them to defect from their previous ideas and discourses.

This research, therefore, expands specific knowledge on the causal study of critical junctures, confirming that institutional change is caused if different conditions apart from the external shock itself –critical antecedents, productive conditions, or joint belief shift, among others– are met. In addition, it complements comprehensive studies on EU integration, and supports the general belief that the EU is, as politician J. Monnet once proclaimed in 1976, ‘forged in crisis’."
Unravelling the Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Household Consumption: A Decomposition Analysis of the Netherlands Between 2000-2019,"['Sütő, Gergo']","['Harmsen, Robert']",2022-09-09T03:02:20Z,EN,['GHG emissions; household consumption; decomposition analysis; environmentally-extended input-output analysis; the Netherlands'],Sustainable Development,"This study examined the relationship between climate change and household consumption in the Netherlands. During the period 2000-2019, the direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions attributable to Dutch household expenditures were reduced from 151.7 to 127.1 MtCO2e. The study aimed at understanding to what extent socioeconomic factors contributed to this reduction of emissions. Five driving factors were selected to be evaluated: population, household size, household demand, demand structure, and emission intensity. A combination of environmentally-extended input-output analysis and decomposition analysis was utilised to quantify each driver’s impact on household GHG emissions. The results indicate that the estimated -24.6 Mt reduction of emissions was facilitated by three drivers and counterbalanced by two of them. Decreasing the emission intensity of consumption contributed -30.9 Mt, and lower household demand (after inflation) and a slight shift of consumption towards less emissive sectors added another -5.0 and -1.6 Mt each. In contrast, population growth and a decrease in household size were found to have raised household GHG emissions by 12.5 and 9.7 Mt, respectively. An amount of -9.3 Mt remained unexplained due to data inconsistencies. The findings underline the importance of decreasing emission intensities as mitigations realised this way have outpaced economic growth in the past two decades. At the same time, the results also highlight the powerful role of demographic trends prevailing in the Netherlands, which prospective climate policies are recommended to address to optimise GHG emission reductions."

Overheidsinstanties gaan mee met deze ontwikkelingen en gebruiken steeds vaker middelen, zoals algoritmen en kunstmatige intelligentie, om beleid op basis van geautomatiseerde besluitvorming in te richten. Voorafgaand het implementeren van deze middelen, kunnen ethische dilemma’s voorkomen. Publieke professionals dienen dan een keuze te maken, waarbij er nooit helemaal recht kan worden gedaan bij alle waarden. Het maken van een ‘juiste’ keuze kan daardoor lastig zijn. In de weinige raamwerken over geautomatiseerde besluitvorming bij overheidsinstanties wordt niet veel aandacht besteed aan de rol van de publieke professional. Dit is problematisch, omdat publieke professionals degenen zijn die om dienen te gaan met ethische dilemma’s die voorkomen in aanloop naar de implementatiefase. Het is daardoor onduidelijk hoe publieke professionals waarden afwegen die voorkomen bij ethische dilemma’s. Het inzichtelijk maken van dit proces draagt bij aan het bewerkstelligen van een transparantere overheid.

In dit onderzoek is daarom getracht om inzicht te krijgen in hoe publieke professionals omgaan met ethische dilemma’s bij geautomatiseerde besluitvorming, zonder een oordeel te geven aan de keuzes die zij zouden maken. De onderzoeksvraag luidt als volgt: “Wat zijn de ethische dilemma’s rondom geautomatiseerde besluitvormingsprocessen, berust op kunstmatige intelligentie en algoritmen, die publieke professionals ervaren en op welke manier maken zij een afweging tussen verschillende waarden in de besluitvorming?”

Daarna is de vraag beantwoord aan de hand van negentien vignetteninterviews met publieke professionals bij de provincie Zuid-Holland. De resultaten hiervan hebben geleid tot de herontwikkeling van het conceptuele model, dat weergeeft hoe publieke professionals omgaan met ethische dilemma’s bij geautomatiseerde besluitvorming.

Subsequently, a personal interview took place. Positive, but opposed to expectations, depressive 
symptoms appeared to decrease and there was no more negative self-esteem over time. In addition, there was no difference in depressive symptoms over time between boys and girls. In accordance with 
expectations, girls appeared to have a lower self-esteem than boys during measurement moments 1 
and 3. During measurement moment 2, self-esteem did not differ between gender. Furthermore, it 
appeared that non-westerners experienced more depressive symptoms than westerners during 
measurement moment 2, which was in line with expectations. During measurement moments 1 and 3, 
the self-esteem did not differ between westerners and non-westerners. Opposed to expectations, there 
appeared to be no difference in self-esteem between non-westerners and westerners. Current study 
knows some limitations, for example that is was not included in the analyses whether or not de 
children were bullied during measurements 2 and 3. When future research studies would include this, 
a more evident image could be given on the course of symptoms within a certain victim group. Current

To answer the research questions, the quantitative analysis method was used. A total of 493 individuals participated in a cross-sectional survey and were administered four different questionnaires (Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12, Beck Depression Scale, Responses to Positive Affect, and Ruminative Response Scale). The data were collected, and SPSS 23 was used for the analysis. According to the results, positive emotional regulation is essential for predicting depression and even acts as a moderator through ""inhibitory anxiety”. However, negative emotional regulation does not seem to be a moderator in predicting depression through Intolerance of Uncertainty.  The complex interactions of IU, emotional regulation and depression were highlighted in this study, suggesting possible psychotherapeutic targets. Limitations of the study include a cross-sectional design and demographic factors such as socio-economic level and gender. Future studies could benefit by checking for comorbid situations such as anxiety disorders, which appear commonly with depression and in which IU also seems to play an important pathogenetic role."

However, research shows that watching a commemoration can also trigger emotions like anger or sadness. There might be a protective factor for these emotions triggered by commemoration, namely religion. In several studies religion is described as a protective factor for negative emotions. Not much is known about the protected factor religion after commemorating and the effect on emotions. That is why this descriptive research aims to investigate the difference in emotion in participants with PTS symptoms because of war, after watching the Dutch National Commemoration of the second world war (WWII), and in addition, whether or not being religious is a protective factor for this difference in emotions. It is also investigated what people focus on during a commemoration, and whether being religious or not makes a difference on this focus. In total 95 participants completed the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5) and reported their emotions before and after watching the commemoration. 82 participants reported what they focused on during the commemoration. A hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to examine if PTS symptoms and religion were a predictor of the change in emotions, controlled for age. Five point biserial correlations were preformed to test whether there is a correlation between religion and what touched the participants the most while watching the commemoration. There is only a significant result found for the relationship between PTS symptoms and the difference in negative emotions after watching the commemoration. These findings show how important it is to understand the impact of a commemoration on the emotions of people who experienced war. Further research could be beneficial to get more knowledge on why people with war experience have more negative emotions when looking at a commemorations and if they can participate in the commemoration in a different way that has a less big impact."

Even within postdramatic theatre, where music is not essentially sub-ordinate to logocentrism, music is often not granted the deserved attention. However, this thesis shows the extensive role that music potentially plays in postdramatic theatre. It investigates how music and musicality can contribute to a postdramatic dramaturgy. More specifically within the dramaturgy of the work ENA ENA (2021) by Greek performance maker and composer Thanasis Deligiannis. In doing so, I attempt to broaden and yet also specify and contextualise Hans-Thies Lehmann’s idea of musicalisation, who focused on orality far more than other (non-)aural signs. I look at how intrinsic qualities of music as an art form have clear similarities with postdramatic theatre, and how music’s absoluteness led to many theatre makers turning towards music as a compositional influence of their creation. Furthermore, David Roesner’s conceptualisation of musicality helps me to explore the manner in which non-aural phenomena can be experienced ‘as if’ and created ‘as’ music within postdramatic theatre. Additionally, I explore what aspects come to the fore when trying to understand music and musicality within postdramatic theatre. These aspects create a thorough outline for the many levels in which music can contribute to postdramatic theatre. However, an in-depth musical and dramaturgical analysis of ENA ENA shows that these many levels also contribute strongly to – and also inform for a great part – its dramaturgy. This thesis concludes that music-oriented analyses of postdramatic dramaturgies are necessary in order to understand the extensive contribution music has in the contemporary theatre practice, and thus it insists on opening the analytical ears of performance studies."

I examine three different forms of public religious participation in which most Athenian women could partake: holding religious office such as priesthoods (chapter 1), dedicating votive offerings (chapter 2) and participating in religious festivals (chapter 3). I use a variety of epigraphical, iconographical, archaeological and literary sources that show women’s ritual agency directly and indirectly. In my conclusion, I compare the findings and different social roles I detected in the three different forms of participation to examine the differences and similarities in the social roles detected. This eventually leads to the answer to my research question: how did the different types of female participation in Athenian polis-cults help define the portrayal of women’s social roles and vice versa? Throughout my thesis I also look at whether Athenian women’s citizenship status can be detected within sources that displays women’s ritual agency in the Athenian polis- cults."

We utilized the JLCG, the work-centrality and the f-sozU k-6 scales for each variable respectively.

Based on our results, we have been able to accept H1, implying that JLCG is more likely to be experienced by people who score high on work centrality. While results were significant for H2, moderation was not, so we do not have enough evidence to accept H2. These results imply that while there are significant factors present, the moderating role of social support could not be supported.  Lastly, we suggest further research with a more heterogeneous sample in order to further investigate these results, as well as a longitudinal research in lieu of a cross-sectional design."
"Ambiguous Indifference? An Investigation of Irish Perceptions of the Armenian Question, 1895-1924.","['Mc Hugh, Sadhbh']","['Ozavci, Ozan']",2022-09-09T04:01:15Z,EN,"['Armenian Genocide, Irish Nationalism, Recognition, Competitive Victimhood.']",International Relations in Historical Perspective,"This thesis was inspired by the Irish government’s peculiarly ambiguous position regarding the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. It is an historical research into the contemporary Irish reactions to the events that were unfolding in the Near East from 1895 to 1924. The First World War brought a new radicalism to Irish nationalist politics and saw the retrenchment of unionist loyalties to the British Empire. Nationalists in Ireland regarded themselves and their independence aspirations as the most legitimate and exceptional in the world, and therefore regarded the Armenian cause and the international sympathy it garnered with hostile competitiveness. Unionists openly expressed sympathy of the Armenian cause as a way to demonstrate their continued belief in the war aims of the British government and their commitment to remaining part of the Empire. The ways in which Irish opinion on the Armenian cause was influenced by domestic and international factors will be closely examined in this research with the aid of previously unexplored primary sources from 1895 to 1924."
"Applying Intersectionality Theory to Pluvial Flood Risk -
An empirical analysis of social vulnerability to urban pluvial flooding in Europe","['Boesler, Peppi']","['Scown, Murray']",2022-09-14T00:00:52Z,EN,['pluvial flooding; intersectionality; climate justice; urban; Europe'],Sustainable Development,"Climate change projections indicate that extreme precipitation events will increase in the future, 
leading to increased pluvial flooding and flood hazards. While there is increasing attention toward 
flood risk analysis and adaptation, pluvial flood risk is still only marginally addressed in research. 
Additionally, urbanization intensifies the frequency of flooding in cities because of a reduction in 
permeable surfaces. In the face of climate hazards, multiple forms of climate injustices in today’s cities 
are well-documented and are usually faced by marginalized and low-income communities. Despite this 
knowledge, research indicates that traditional urban (flood) adaptation policies are most often 
founded on exclusionary and technocratic approaches that tend to neglect the structural causes of 
social vulnerabilities. Intersectionality theory can help to uncover and address these multidimensional 
levels of vulnerability and can be utilized to inform such adaptation measures. Hence, this research 
will focus on pluvial flooding impacts in European urban areas with an additional focus on 
intersectional social vulnerabilities relating to climate justice issues within pluvial flood protection 
planning. Informed by intersectionality theory, this research presents an intersectional vulnerability 
index (IVI) to pluvial flooding in a European urban context. The IVI is built around 10 dimensions of 
social vulnerabilities (education, housing, special needs populations, economic status, gender, 
nationality, family structure, age, people without social networks, and infrastructure dependence). The 
IVI is then computed into a readily transferable composite index (CI).
The index is applied to two case studies and helps to unveil the most socially vulnerable districts and 
compounding social vulnerabilities of people through statistical analysis. Paired with an urban flood 
exposure dataset, districts are being identified that experience relatively high social vulnerabilities 
combined with relatively high pluvial flood exposure levels. The paper further discusses pluvial flooding 
and social vulnerabilities in a climate justice context, identifying structures of intersecting 
discriminations and resulting vulnerabilities and disproportionality in flood impacts. The thesis 
concludes with recommendations to enhance social justice within FRM."
"Science Fiction Film and Becoming Otherwise: Woundedness, Posthuman Performativity, and Reinventing Subjectivity","['Jakubiec, Justyna']","['Dolphijn, R.']",2022-09-14T00:00:55Z,EN,['Science fiction film; genetic engineering; literacy; woundedness; subjectivity; becoming otherwise; posthuman performativity'],"Media, Art and Performance studies","This thesis is about becoming otherwise. The notion of Man, occupying the central position within the 
processes of meaning-making, needs to be accounted for affirmatively. Doing so becomes increasingly 
pressing as our particular world that we live with wants to, more or less gradually, implement the 
technology of genetic engineering. Despite being present in our awareness since the 1970s, this 
technological development is still proving to face us with questions that are not at all easy to answer. 
They ceaselessly make us wonder: what would it mean to engineer genetically? What and who would
emerge if this technology was engaged with? How would we think of ourselves if genetic engineering 
became an integral part of how we make sense of the world?

This thesis shows that we are not at all oblivious to those questions. We have already been 
developing particular literacies upon discourses that are already there. Those literacies can be found in 
science fiction cinema, a genre that has always remained curious about newly emerging scientific and 
technological developments. This thesis offers a reading of two science fiction films – ""Blade Runner"" and 
""Gattaca"" – to let us come closer to the question of what would it mean to find a new unit of reference and
become otherwise about frameworks upon which we have been developing our subjectivities.

Frameworks around genetic engineering and science fiction films might not be generous. 
Nevertheless, this thesis shows that thanks to the notion of woundedness, one might come closer to 
developing an affirmative outlook on those frameworks. Becoming otherwise can take place thanks to 
the wound. Becoming otherwise, in the case of this thesis, means reinventing subjectivity and inventing a 
posthuman performative subjectivity. Nothing should be seen as predetermined. This thesis embraces 
this thought and offers us respite."
Cultural heritage buildings in the circular transition,"['Buring, Liselotte']","['Bidmon, Christina']",2022-09-14T00:00:54Z,EN,['circular economy; cultural heritage buildings; circular implementation process; stakeholder analysis'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"In 2050, 75%-90% of the existing building stock will still be standing in the Northern Hemisphere. To comply with the goals of becoming fully circular by 2050 in the Netherlands, the existing building stock needs to be considered in this process. The circular economy is currently known for lacking a social and cultural dimension, which makes its application challenging for the existing cultural heritage building stock. The transformation of CH is challenging because it has to find a synergy between cultural and social values, economic growth and environmental sustainability. Therefore, this research aims to answer how the implementation of circularity can be stimulated within the cultural heritage built environment. To answer this research question, this thesis mobilizes the literature on cultural heritage, conservation theory and the circular economy and carried out a systemic analysis of the existing circular implementation processes within cultural heritage buildings in the Netherlands. The research is performed by analysing 13 semi-structured interviews and 252 documents to assure data triangulation. The results allowed to map the CE implementation process, with the current status quo, including the main challenges for stakeholders. Next, the findings offer practical implications on how the circular transition can be stimulated within the CH built environment. The main findings suggest that the five main target areas identified to stimulate the CE implementation within CH buildings are policy support, knowledge development, stakeholder engagement and collaboration, maximum cultural value retention and the creation of new financial opportunities. The findings hold the promise of advancing theory regarding how to incorporate social and cultural dimension in the assessment of CE implementation performances. Suggestions for further research include a circular component and material level analysis of CH, a life cycle assessment of the sustainable performances of a circular CH building and the exploration of the neighbourhood approach potential."
(NO) HOPE FOR A FUTURE,"['Wormgoor, Danique']","['Henig, David']",2022-09-14T00:01:00Z,EN,['Extinction Rebellion; Futural Imaginations; Social Movements; Hope; Eco-Anxiety'],Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship,"We, living beings, find ourselves in a rapidly changing world. Humanity can no longer deny

impact our “being” and “moving” in the present world. This study draws from three months of
ethnographic research among members of Extinction Rebellion (XR) Amsterdam who are
campaigning for a climate-just world. It presents how XR members imagine climate futures,
resulting in different orientations and how this translates into activist citizenship. First, I present
how XR portrays two dichotomous futural imaginations: going extinct or surviving. However,
the rebels of XR are not a homogenous group as they demonstrate that their futural ideas are
personal, multi-layered, and more nuanced. Second, I elaborate on how these imaginations
trigger feelings and cause rebels to orientate differently towards the future. Two orientations
that strongly emerged were hope and anticipation – in the form of eco-anxiety. Third, I
demonstrate how futural imaginations and orientations impact the way of being and acting in
the present. I conclude that one can see an activating process among the rebels: The futural
imaginations affect rebels in the present as they become activist citizens. In turn, the rebels
hope they can live a worthwhile life by becoming activist citizens; a moral person that fits the
ethics and morals of XR and maybe somehow influence the future."

In this thesis, I will examine the long-lasting social, environmental, and health effects of living with toxicity and the concept of slow violence (Nixon 2011) to provide insight and a language to understand what living in a toxic world means, and to show how this is violent in many ways. As I will argue, it is insightful to regard toxicity as a form of slow violence, as this emphasizes the power imbalances and struggles of the residents who try to resist this. Within this examination of living with toxicity in the surroundings of Schiphol, I will also debate Nixon’s (2011) standard definition of slow violence and propose to expand this by focusing on the noticeability of slow violence and how this influences the way people understand, perceive and act upon living with toxicity and slow violence. To regard toxicity as slow violence and focusing on the influence of noticeability, allows aspects such as insecurity and resistance to be explored through the notion of slow violence as well."
In a Double Bind,"['Duijts, Sarah']","['Saraf, A.']",2022-09-14T00:00:57Z,EN,['dairy farming; agriculture; double bind; productivity; sustainability; adaptability; knowledge; time'],Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship,"This research is an ethnographic account of contemporary Dutch dairy farming and is the outcome of three months of ethnographic fieldwork in the Netherlands among dairy farmers. Dutch dairy farmers currently face a paradoxical situation caused by conflicting socio-economic demands. Their experiences of being food producers within contemporary changing global capitalism, which is organized by national and global ecological sustainability challenges, can be described as a double bind. To sustain their livelihood, dairy farmers are seeking alternative opportunities as respond to the paradox. They manage to do so, based on what I describe as their boerenverstand, or farmers’ knowledge. Their boerenverstand is embedded in practical as well as scientific knowledge and empowers them to determine for themselves which new agricultural developments are functioning and which are not. In addition, their exclusive knowledge is organized by their understanding of time in terms of recurrence, progress, and development. However, this notion of time is not in with the Dutch government’s vision on change and transition within the dairy sector. As a result, the different temporal horizons of the dairy farmers and the Dutch government has evoked an impasse in expectations of agricultural development and change. In short, this research describes Dutch dairy farmers’ orientations in the double bind between productivity and ecological sustainability."

Functioneren in een sturingsspagaat: Hoe ambtenaren omgaan met hiërarchische sturing wanneer zij de overheid vertegenwoordigen in netwerksamenwerkingen in het landelijk gebied.,"['Holl, Simon']","['Geuijen, Karin']",2022-09-29T00:00:45Z,NL,['publiek management; governance; meta-governance; hiërarchische sturing; netwerksamenwerking; stikstofcrisis; landelijk gebied; gebiedsprocessen; typologie; exploratief onderzoek; casestudy'],Public Management,"Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd in opdracht van de provincie Utrecht en is gericht op sturingsdilemma’s van uitvoerende ambtenaren die namens de provincie deelnemen aan gebiedsprocessen. De provincie maakt vaak gebruik van gebiedsprocessen als instrument om tot uitvoering te komen van beleid rond stikstofreductie, circulaire landbouw, bodemdaling en natuurherstel. In een gebiedsproces zitten verschillende partijen – waaronder provincies, waterschappen, boerenbelangenorganisaties en terreinbeherende organisaties – met elkaar aan tafel om voor een lokaal gebied een toekomstplan op te stellen. 

In dit onderzoek is in kaart gebracht hoe ambtenaren die de provincie vertegenwoordigen in gebiedsprocessen omgaan met de sturing vanuit de interne organisatie. Beleidsafdelingen, leidinggevenden en bestuurders passen in bepaalde situaties hiërarchische sturing toe om toe te zien dat de provinciale ambities voldoende zijn terug te zien in de uitkomsten van het gebiedsproces. Hierdoor kunnen projectleiders zich tijdens gebiedsprocessen in een sturingsspagaat bevinden. Als deelnemer van het gebiedsproces zijn zij direct onderdeel van een horizontaal samenwerkingsverband. Daarbij wordt gestreefd naar consensus, is sprake van wederzijdse afhankelijkheid en wordt gewerkt op basis van vertrouwen. Tegelijkertijd krijgen projectleiders in sommige situaties te maken met hiërarchische sturing vanuit de interne organisatie. Top-down sturing is niet altijd verenigbaar met de eerder beschreven werkwijze in gebiedsprocessen. 

In dit onderzoek heb ik exploratief onderzoek gedaan op basis van kwalitatieve onderzoeksmethoden. Middels een exploratieve case study bij de provincie Utrecht zijn de strategieën van ambtenaren in kaart gebracht. Hierbij is data verzameld door interviews af te nemen met verschillende projectleiders. Voor de data-analyse is gebruik gemaakt van een operationalisering van de concepten ‘hiërarchische sturing’ en ‘omgangsstrategieën’. Daarnaast is een typologie van verschillende omgangsstrategieën opgesteld. 

Deze typologie bestaat uit vier strategieën die ambtenaren toepassen wanneer zij te maken krijgen met interne hiërarchische sturing: opvolgen, bemiddelen, beïnvloeden en beschermen. Deze vier strategieën sluiten elkaar niet uit. Eén ambtenaar kan meerdere strategieën toepassen afhankelijk van de situatie waarin zij verkeert. Daarbij zijn twee factoren te onderscheiden die meespelen in de overweging om een bepaalde strategie in te zetten. Ten eerste is de mate waarin sturing wordt geaccepteerd door de ambtenaar van belang. Zo kan het bijvoorbeeld prettig zijn om aan het begin sturing te zoeken om posities helder te krijgen, terwijl later in het proces wijzigingen juist voor spanning kunnen zorgen omdat plannen concreter zijn geworden en er mogelijk al toezeggingen zijn gedaan. Acceptatie van sturing kan bijvoorbeeld ook verschillen door het beeld dat de projectleider heeft van sturing. Naast de mate van acceptatie is ook de plek waar projectleiders draagvlak zoeken van belang voor de strategie die zij kiezen. Als er behoefte is aan intern draagvlak wordt een andere strategie gekozen dan wanneer extern draagvlak nodig is bij samenwerkingspartners."
Sustainable Transitions for Large Enterprises: A case study of B Corporations,"['Oomen-Lochtefeld, Zulia']","['Vijge, Marjanneke']",2022-09-29T00:00:47Z,EN,['certified B Corporation; corporate sustainability; corporate transitions; large enterprises; sustainable hybrid business models'],Sustainable Development,"The urgency of the climate crisis and global inequality demands the action of all, including the private sector. While smaller, mission driven companies have initially led the corporate sustainability transition, moving towards a more sustainable economic system and remaining within planetary boundaries requires the participation of large companies as well. Increasing pressure from sustainability-oriented competitors and societal expectations are driving more companies to participate in a voluntary transition to more sustainable business models. This research uses the case study of the B Corporation (“B Corp”) certification facilitated by the nonprofit B Lab to investigate the transition that large European companies must undergo in order to successfully become a certified B Corp, including the driving motivations and the core challenges that they experience in the process. The results will contribute to literature on large enterprise pursuit of corporate sustainability and transitions to a sustainable hybrid business model. 

The results of this research find that large companies are motivated from both external sources,  including a desire for external recognition and verification and an increased competitive advantage; and internal sources, including an ambition for an internal transformation, interest from senior leadership, or to join a supportive community of businesses working on impact; but tend to evolve over time from an initial interest in external brand recognition and a collective, systems change ambition. In this transformation, large companies undergo several stages of transition, beginning with an Initial B Corp Certification which includes internal mobilization, resource allocation, documentation policies, engaging the entire company, and stakeholder governance changes. Then, companies embark on a long-term Impact Improvement Journey where they improve internal operations, connect impact to their long-term strategy, adopt a continuous improvement mindset, and celebrate successes. Finally, companies engage their value chain and join collective action initiatives Systems Change Ambassador in a mature B Corp phase. In the process, large companies experience challenges related to B Lab timelines, pricing and standards; internal challenges including a culture shift, prioritization, data management, and governance changes; and external challenges due to lack of awareness and supply chain complexities. 

Understanding how large companies can transition from conventional business models towards a sustainable hybrid business model, with the example of B Corp certification, highlights the areas of investment that are necessary to make impactful changes in corporate behavior related to social and environmental impacts and ultimately address the Sustainable Development Goals."

Hence, this research analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution of land and biomass water productivity in Metahara. WaPOR data covering 2009-2021 was used to analyze five irrigation scheme performance indicators: i) land and water productivity, ii) productivity gaps, iii) water consumption, iv) uniformity, and v) adequacy. The WaPOR data was compared to ground-level data for validation. Stakeholders were consulted to understand the results and the results of the WaPOR data were compared to two other variables: soil texture and the influence of the saltwater of Lake Basaka.

The temporal results from this research revealed that water productivity decreased over time, and that droughts explained partly for temporal variations. Furthermore, biomass did not increase, and water consumption 
 ncreased instead of decreased over time. Due to soil compaction and the related decreased infiltration capacity, more water is applied while not more water reaches the crops. Spatial variation in land and water productivity was related to the influence of Lake Basaka. Fields closer to Lake Basaka had lower productivity. More compacted and finer soil textures had a higher water consumption, better uniformity, and higher adequacy. Soil texture did not explain for spatial land and water productivity variation but did explain for temporal variations. Also, fields with a higher water consumption had an overall higher biomass production. Concluding, spatial and temporal distribution in water productivity related to the influence of Lake Basaka, soil texture, and droughts. 

This research contributes to the wider scope of knowledge in remote sensing-based data because it has proven that on-the-ground knowledge is needed to explain for varieties in time and space shown by remote sensing data. Some findings in spatial land and water productivity could only be declared with stakeholder knowledge. Nevertheless, the remote sensing-based research is valuable, and the future potential is high."
The Role of Media with Sexual Content on Adolescents’ Sexual Risk Behavior and Pleasure & the Mediation of this Association by Adolescent SDS-Stereotypes,"['Yerebakan, Deniz']","['Endendijk, Joyce']",2022-09-29T00:00:31Z,EN,['Sexual double standard stereotypes; sexuality; adolescence; media types with sexual content; sexual risk behavior; sexual pleasure'],Applied Cognitive Psychology,"Sex and sexual relationships are commonly portrayed in media and adolescents are frequently exposed to these kinds of content from various media types (i.e., social media accounts, reality television, online pornography, and music videos). Previous research suggested associations between exposure to sexual content and adolescent sexual behavior as well as adolescent sexual double standard (SDS) stereotypes. To gain deeper insight into how media with sexual content may be associated with adolescent sexual behavior, the current study investigated the relationship between the level of exposure to media with sexual content and adolescent sexual risk behavior and sexual pleasure, and whether adolescents’ SDS stereotypes mediated these associations. Data were collected through an online survey at schools in the Netherlands (aged 16-20 years, N=257). No significant associations were found between the level of exposure to media types with sexual content and adolescent sexual risk behavior and sexual pleasure. In addition, adolescents’ SDS stereotypes did not mediate the associations between the level of exposure to media types with sexual content and adolescent sexual risk behavior and sexual pleasure. However, some individual significant associations were identified based on specific media types; (1) the level of exposure to reality TV was associated with higher levels of adolescent sexual risk behavior, and (2) the level of exposure to pornography was associated with higher levels of sexual pleasure. One of the important practical implications of this research include informing sexual education programs about factors that could be taken into account when creating the content to prevent sexual risk behavior and stimulate sexual pleasure in adolescents."

These semi-arid and arid environments are subject to desertification. Africa is a heavily degraded continent, with desertification affecting over 46% of the continent’s surface. In the case of Morocco, approximately 90% of the land is classified as desert. The documentary ‘Oasis in de Orient’ is what started the interest in desertification for this thesis. M’hamid el Ghizlane is an example of a town that is threatened by desertification, causing land degradation, a change in livelihood and the displacement of people. Here, migration is seen as the best adaptation strategy to the change in environment and livelihood. Internationally as well as in Morocco there are initiatives that focus on fighting desertification using projects and plans to protect heavily degraded areas. However, the environment keeps deteriorating and the threat by desertification has gotten worse over the years. Education is seen as a good tool to shape behaviour and attitude into an environmentally positive way and to provide people with technical knowledge to prevent disasters from happening. Therefore, this research focusses on the role of education in the fight against desertification. Document analysis and a case study using interviews and observations have been used to gather data on this subject and to add to the literature on the relationship between education and desertification."

Mechtild of Guelders, duchess-pretender of Guelders, 1365-1380","[""Velt, Roos in 't""]","['Mostert, M.']",2022-10-06T00:00:33Z,EN,['Epistology; Guelders; Gelre; Duchy of Guelders; Hertogdom Gelre; Mechteld van Gelre; Mechtild of Guelders; Gelders Archief; letter network analysis; network analysis;'],"Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance Studies","184 original letters aimed at, sent by, and related to Mechtild of Guelders can nowadays be found in the archives of the Duchy of Guelders, which are part of the collection of the Gelders Archief at Arnhem; all of these letters were written between circa 1367 and 1380. Most of them stem from the First War of the Guelderian Succession (1372-1379), during which Mechtild was one of the two pretenders for the ducal throne of Guelders.
This collection of 184 letters has been described before as ‘unique’ and as ‘a small treasure’ regarding its large scope as well as being an early testimony to epistolary correspondence in the vernacular languages from the Low Countries and the Rhineland. The letters are evidence of the use of vernacular languages in the late fourteenth century, but also of politics, and they show how people in this period lived, thought, and acted in their day-to-day lives. Another interesting element is that the collection shows examples of personal and intimate communication between women, as it contains letters sent to Mechtild by some of her female relatives, wives of allies, and other noblewomen.
Also of interest is that the identity of many people that sent, received, or were mentioned in the letters can be traced. A large number of them belonged to the higher strata of fourteenth-century society, with dukes, counts, knights, ministeriales and clergymen present among them. Therefore, their names can often be found in other contemporary sources as well.
Despite the letter collection’s potential for academics, it has rarely received attention from scholars. An effort to discuss the letter collection in its entirety, alongside an analysis of the topics and people encountered in it, has yet to be made. Therefore, this thesis will paint a general, broad overview of the letter collection to lay the groundwork for further research. This will be done through two different analyses: an analysis of the different topics presented in the letters and another of the network of people represented in the letter collection as it developed with time.
This thesis consists of four chapters. The first two chapters look at the broader context of the letter collection, its history, and the political and military context in which the letters were written. In the two following chapters, the letter collection will be analysed both regarding its contents and the people mentioned in the letters.
In the first chapter, a biography of Mechtild is presented, which encompasses her life before, during, and after the First War of the Guelderian Succession. The war itself, its causes and the major events that took place during the war will be highlighted, as will certain events that are relevant to certain letters. In the second chapter, the focus will be on broader developments in late medieval pragmatic literacy and epistolary culture, and how these developments are visible within Mechtild's letter collection. 
After these two contextualising chapters, two chapters which analyse the letter collection itself will follow. In the third chapter, topics discussed in the letters will be analysed. The letters are sorted into five categories: personal matters, politics, warfare, financial matters, and law. Each category will be discussed and illustrated with examples taken from the letters. In the fourth chapter, a network analysis of the people represented in the letters is presented. This will be done through a chronological lens: the period in which the letters were written is split into four separate ‘eras’, which are based on the information presented in the first chapter. In each of these eras, certain people with whom Mechtild maintained epistolary connections will be discussed, alongside other people occurring within the broader correspondence. These connections can be linked with Mechtild to discover smaller sub-networks within the broader netw"

My methods are rooted in network science and based on data from OpenStreetMap. To acquire network data over the research period from 2013 until 2022, the Python package OSMnx was used. Several subnetworks were defined, such as the bicyclable network and the bicycle specific infrastructure. I proposed several network measures and showed the results of a selection of measures on Copenhagen, as well as three other cities of similar size. The selection of five measures can be divided into two groups: 1) Random route lengths (compared to car route length); 2) Total network lengths (% bicycle specific infrastructure). These measures are meant to quantify changes in bicycle friendliness and differences between cities, all based on OSM data.  Using combinations of different measures can mitigate the shortcomings of each measure. Therefore I recommend adding more network measures to the ‘toolbox’ for future research."

Neuroblastoma poses a big challenge for immunotherapy by secretion of immunomodulatory proteins and extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the tumour microenvironment (TME). Therefore, we aim to investigate the optimal method to isolate extracellular vesicles from the secretome of neuroblastoma tumour organoids with the purpose of preserved functional activity of the EVs. We isolated EVs from 14 neuroblastoma tumour organoids and healthy reference cells by use of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) after which the EVs were characterised and quantified. We established the EVs preserved some functional capacity in co-culture with immune cells and demonstrated the isolation method is compatible with MS analysis of the EV protein composition. Thus this study establishes a suitable method to isolate functional EVs from tumour organoids, enabling further research into their potential immunosuppressive capacity in the TME of neuroblastoma."

Through the use of quantitative methods such as word embeddings and n-gram analysis, applied to historical Dutch newspapers, the project demonstrates the Orientalist, cultural supremacist origins of the concept of the West and shows how the emphasis of the concept shifted over the course of the Cold War to become a concept of ideological superiority. Not only does this project contribute to the historiography on the idea of the West, but it also re-evaluates methodological innovations in the field of conceptual history, by incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methods to mutually support each other. By performing a close reading of Johan Huizinga’s final work Geschonden wereld, we witness the discursive shift, uncovered through the quantitative methodology of the project, occurring in actual historical discourse. Onze westersche beschaving aids in deconstructing the concept, which plays a leading role in current geopolitical tensions, and can help us re-evaluate the legitimacy and meaning of this idea."
STUDYING REPLICATION ORGANELLES USING ADVANCED FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY,"['Schlemmer, Anna-Sophie']","['Kuppeveld, Frank van']",2022-10-05T00:00:29Z,EN,[],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"The enterovirus genus comprises many human pathogens such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus 
and rhinovirus. For efficient replication, enteroviruses induce membrane rearrangements 
which require the interaction between viral and host factors such as PI4KB, ACBD3 and 3A.
Although interactions between these proteins have been intensively studied, their 
localization at replication organelle (RO) membranes is unknown. To investigate components 
of ROs in-depth, we established protocols to study coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) ROs using
expansion microscopy (ExM) and super-resolution microscopy (SRM), i.e. Olympus 
SoRaSpin10 system. Our data is the first evidence of 2A localization. The use of SRM allowed 
us to visualize the localization of the viral protease 2A at different time points of infection in 
greater detail. In addition, we could locate 3A at an early time point after infection (i.e. 
3 h p.i.), which was hardly attainable with conventional immunofluorescence microscopy.
Our data suggest that imaging at earlier time points might be possible. Moreover, both viral 
proteins were visualized as dotted structures which have not yet been observed. We
demonstrate the potential for in-depth visualization of these viral proteins and their 
colocalization with host factors using super-resolution microscopy. The Olympus SoRaSpin10 
system offers the possibility to combine SRM with live-cell imaging. Thus, tracking viral 
protein localization, RO formation and its dynamics could be further investigated."

Getting Burned-Out is a Matter of Time: Are State-Provided Family-Friendly Policies able to Moderate the Relationship Between Work-Care-Time-Accumulation and Maternal Burnout?,"['Gaal, Jessey van']","['Hoogenboom, Marcel']",2022-10-10T23:02:39Z,EN,['Work-Care Time Accumulation; Work-Life Balance; Family-Friendly Policies; Maternal Burnout; OECD-countries'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Background: Many theories found a link between stress or exhaustion from work/care responsibilities and burnout, especially for mothers with (young) children. As women are increasingly expected to combine labor market participation with family care responsibilities, so-called “double shift” working is becoming the new standard. Research on accumulation of time spend on work/care (WCTA) is scarce, and so is the evidence on the direct link between WCTA and Maternal Burnout (MB). As Family-Friendly Policies (FFPs) are believed to lower stress-levels as a result of e.g., flexible work-time arrangements, it is interesting to investigate the link between WCTA and MB, and the possible moderating role of FFPs. 
Methods: Several existing datasets were used to investigate the various concepts (Roskam et al., 2017; OECD.Stats, n.d.). A sample of 4760 working mothers in a heterosexual relationship from 18 OECD countries (Mage = 37.71 SDage = 6.92) answered questions on time spend on work/care and parental burnout between 2017 and 2019. Several models were tested with SPSS using (multiple) linear regression analysis (MLR). Results: Results showed that WCTA and MB, and most of its components, were positively and significantly related, except for Emotional Distancing, which was negatively and significantly related (H1-2). Also, no evidence was found for moderation of FFPs (H3-4). When distinguishing between policy types, the model including familiarizing policies was significant and explained more variance in MB than the model including defamiliarizing policies. However, moderation effects were not significant (H5). 
Discussion: The results of this study are surprising as state provided FFPs seem unable to decrease burnout levels for mothers that are experience high combined work and care hours, although such FFPs are implemented to establish a balance between the two domains. More emphasis may therefore be put on employer benefits and arrangements in tackling future rates of burnout among mothers."
Ethnic differences in female part-time employment in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. A capability approach to assess the opportunity of women to adjust their working hours.,"['Jahaj, Rozafa']","['Yerkes, Mara']",2022-10-10T23:02:48Z,EN,"['Capability Approach; Part-time employment; ethnic differences, female part-time.']",Social Policy and Public Health,"The differences between ethnic minority women and native majority women in the labor 
market are often neglected in research. This lack is problematic because women from an 
ethnic minority background face a multitude of challenges not experienced by native 
majority women. Not uncovering the reasons behind these challenges can increase the 
likelihood of ethnic minority women being confined to lower socio-economic levels, adds
to growing income disparities and increases chances of a lower overall quality of life. One 
of these gaps in research concerns the lesser prevalence of ethnic minority women 
working part-time and the reasoning behind this.

This exploratory study examines whether ethnic minority women have differing abilities 
to work part-time and whether they value doing so differently. By applying the Sen's 
Capability Approach, it aims to answer to what extent do ethnic minority women differ 
from native-born women in their likelihood to work part-time and to what extent these 
differences are explained by the value placed on adjusting working hours and the 
capabilities to do so?

The study worked with a non-probability post-hoc representative sample collected as part 
of the ERC CAPABLE Project to examine secondary survey data from respondents in the 
Netherlands and the United Kingdom. A linear probability model was used for 
examination. The results show that ethnic minority women are significantly less likely to 
be working part-time than native women. The value placed on adjusting working hours 
and capabilities to do so ultimately did not mediate this effect, however, offered insights 
into other human capital characteristics which predict the value that women place on 
adjusting working hours. Policies built on these findings could help uncover the target 
groups who effectively want to adjust their working hours, ultimately improving 
employment policies. The policy recommendations in this thesis aim to address goals 
beyond financial advantages by including dimensions of well-being such as the value 
individuals place on certain outcomes."
Global Changes of Flood Hazard in Cities,"['Beveren, Jasper van']","['Lutz, Stefanie']",2022-10-10T23:02:30Z,EN,[],Water Science and Management,"As the climate changes, weather patterns are expected to shift. Stakeholders (e.g. policymakers, investors, water managers and planners) are interested in how strong and how frequent future storm events might become and what this means for the climate hazard cities face. Hence, there is need for a global assessment approach that can aid policymakers and investors in determining the city’s most at risk of certain climate hazards. Risk is here defined as the product of the probability of the hazard and a measure of the associated consequence (Risk = Hazard * Exposure * Vulnerability). Climate scientists can estimate changes in climate with global top-down models. However, they can’t trust on the reliability of these models on local scales like cities, they often have difficulties determining hydrological extremes which are especially important for stakeholders. This research aims to contribute to the climate risk assessment of cities, by proposing a new approach to contribute to decision making in determining the city’s most at risk of flooding under different climate conditions. Adding to the assessment of where climate adaptation is deemed necessary. The approach used in this research moves away from conventional top-down approaches and builds on existing bottom-up approaches, utilizing a new methodology by using global datasets, and hydrological models that can simulate the hydrological extremes stakeholders are interested in.
The results show the developed workflow by testing it on the study area of Bangkok for riverine flooding under historic, climate variability and climate change conditions. Although the approach still requires work when assessing the impact of climate change, it already is in a state in which it can raise many interesting discussions about methodologies for climate risk assessments, and possibly can become an established approach in climate risk assessments. A main achievement related to scientific and management implications is that not only steps have been made to improve the reliability of rapid, global flood hazard methodologies but rather a shift in the approach on how to model climate change has started, addressing city-wide resilience issues from a holistic, global perspective. The constructed approach is a solution for the coarse scale and the misinterpretation of hydrological extremes that comes with top-down approaches. Additionally, when adding the exposure and vulnerability components of risk to the suggested approach it can provides opportunities for cities to explore whether climate disasters could have a major impact on society beyond the immediate knowledge of experts and policymakers. This information will be crucial for stakeholders identifying which cities benefit most from adaptations to climate risk under several climate conditions."
Anti-capitalist grassroots initiatives' uses of Cultural Politics to engage with Past and Future visions,"['Birkeland, Sandrine']","['Feola, Giuseppe']",2022-10-10T23:02:37Z,EN,['Collective memory; cultural politics; unmaking capitalism; anti-capitalist grassroots initiatives; future visions'],Sustainable Development,"Modern capitalist societies are widely recognised as socially and environmentally unsustainable. Technological and scientific advances are insufficient to solve the climate and ecological crises that we face. Instead, structural, cultural and social changes are needed within Western societies. These cultural and social changes are crucial and have not been given significant attention in sustainability transformation research. A cultural transformation must include a reconsideration of core beliefs, assumptions and paradigms. Anti-capitalist grassroots initiatives play an influential role for sustainability transitions due to their constituting a fruitful location for experimentation: they build alternative forms of relations to nature, alternative forms of social relations and alternative relationships to property. The work of unmaking capitalist memories and futures and making post-capitalist memories and futures forms a central part of dismantling the hegemonic power of capitalism over our beliefs, hopes, paradigms and habits. Such work is the focus of this study. Limited research has been done on the connection between future visions and past visions within transformative sustainability initiatives. Moreover, the cultural practices that are relevant for anti-capitalist goals is under-researched within sustainability academia. This research attempts to fill these gaps in knowledge.

This study examines anti-capitalist grassroots initiatives’ engagement with the past and future through cultural practices in their attempt to unmake capitalism. A multiple case study analysis was performed on four anti-capitalist grassroots initiatives in Europe. Through interviews and an in-depth analysis of the initiatives’ websites and uses of visual images, the visions of collective memory and of the future of each analysis were explored. The exploration of strategic uses of culture was done through categorising the identified recollections of memory and futuring practices into cultural politics of prefiguration, cultural politics of popularisation, and cultural politics of pressure. The results of the study show that the studied anti-capitalist initiatives engage significantly with cultural politics of unmaking in relation to the future and past. Moreover, results show that the studied initiatives make important uses of popularisation to spread their past and future visions to society. The study provides significant insights on strategies toward the building of cultural shifts for anti-capitalist goals. Moreover, the study builds theory on the role of collective memory for sustainability transformations."
Irrationality in Energy Retrofits - The influence of cognitive biases on the outcomes of the energy retrofit related decision-making process of Dutch homeowners,"['Poorthuis, Wessel']","['Liu, Wen']",2022-10-10T23:02:34Z,EN,['Prospect Theory; built environment; modelling; energy retrofits; energy renovations; Dutch; built environment'],Energy Science,"The heat transition in the Dutch built environment is lagging behind the goals set by the Dutch
government. One of the operations in the heat transition is the retrofitting of dwellings with sustainable
heating installations and insulation. These measures need to be undertaken by the homeowners. However,
there are financially beneficial investments that they do not make. Thus, non-financial factors are also
at play. This thesis examines the influence of cognitive biases on the outcomes of the decision-making
process of Dutch homeowners concerning investments in home energy retrofits.

The research is done by incorporating cognitive biases included in Prospect Theory into the built
environment model Hestia. Comparing the distribution of heating installations and energy labels
between a baseline scenario with only financial considerations and multiple simulation runs with differing
bias strengths allows for separating the influence of the biases without any other factors being present.
Parameter sweeps are done on a municipal geographic scope to examine the behaviour over a large range
of bias strengths. In addition, runs with realistic values are done on a national scale. These simulation
results are also compared to empirical validation data.

The inclusion of the reference dependence bias increases the share of gas-fired heating installations and
decreases the shares of energy labels A and B. For loss aversion, no effect is found on a national scale.
In the parameter sweeps, this bias increases the shares of gas-fired heating installations and energy label
B, while decreasing that of energy label A. Diminishing sensitivity in only gains leads to an increase in
gas and a decrease in energy label A. Diminishing sensitivity in only losses leads to the inverse. When
diminishing sensitivity is active in both domains, the share of gas-fired heating options increases while
that of label A decreases. In the case where all biases are combined, we see the same effects.

From these results, we conclude that the cognitive biases included in Prospect Theory decrease the
number and/or ambition of investments into sustainable heating technologies and insulation. However,
the effects did not change trends i.e. turning a decrease into an increase or vice versa. The biases
brought the distribution of heating installations more in line with the validation data, while for the
distribution of energy labels it is not clear."
Percutaneous cryoablation and (partial) nephrectomy of small renal tumors,"['Jong, Dennis de']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-10-10T23:02:50Z,EN,['Small renal masses; Renal tumors; Percutaneous cryo-ablation; nephrectomy; partial nephrectomy'],Geneeskunde,"Background- In the Netherlands 2700 patients get diagnosed with renal cancer yearly, the typical age is 50-70 years old. The 5-year overall survival for T1(≤7cm) renal carcinoma equals 88%. Amongst treatment options, percutaneous cryoablation(PCA) is associated with less complications and (partial) nephrectomy with better oncologic outcomes.

Methods- Between august 2015 and august 2022 all patients that received primary treatment for a small renal tumor(≤4cm) were included. For the PCA group, repeat interventions were necessary in some cases, those interventions have been included in the analysis of the perioperative complications (CDC <30 days). Oncologic outcomes have been analyzed for patients in follow-up; OS up to 5-years, local and distant recurrence rate.

Results- Total of 455 patients were included, 311 (P)N and 134 in the PCA group. The same number of (P)N’s resulted in 6,4% procedural and 24,8% post-procedural complications. Local and distant recurrence was 1,7% for both and 6 patients in the follow-up are reported dead, none caused by renal cancer. 154 PCA’s were performed, 3,9% procedural and 5,8% post-procedural complications. These patients showed 8,3% local and 6,4% distant recurrence, when correcting for confirmed malignancy this was 9,0% and 10,4%. A total of 9 deaths were reported,6 in the confirmed group, 3 caused by renal cancer.

Conclusion-. The patient selection shows that PCA is performed on older and less healthy patients and with less complications than the (P)N group. Survival for both groups was high with the oncologic outcomes favoring (P)N. These results are in accordance with literature."

Awareness was raised that these measures could increase risks of DV. Social support structure disappeared and decreasing their positive effects. Although a worldwide increase in DV was observed, Dutch government denied this. This research wants to confirm the growth in DV cases during the pandemic and look into situational factors leading to DV.
Methods: Two datasets were used to. Data from CBS answered the first two hypotheses, reflects those reporting DV or requesting advice, divided by role and function. Information per provinces was analysed for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021. A repeated measure ANOVA was performed to see if changes during the years were significant. Data from Eurofound answered the last two hypotheses, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on working and living in Europe. Data was collected during the first lockdown, right after and a year later. Outcome per question was compared over time, the difference between these outcomes was converted in percentages.
Results: Result shows that during the pandemic the request for advice increased while the amount of reports declined. The role of non-professionals became more important role during the pandemic. These results were significant. Professionals still play a key-role in identifying DV but their role did not increase significantly. During the pandemic (the experience of) financial insecurity did not increase but people still struggled to make ends meet. Throughout the pandemic, an increase in psychological problems was noticed. 
Conclusion: Results showed that the measures negatively influence the situational factors of domestic violence. Future research should take a more direct approach and research if new factors were created. Increased knowledge on situational factors could serve as a guide for future policy.

These are effective types of approaches. However, certain preconditions need to exist in order for those mechanisms to work well or optimally. Even though theoretical preconditions were previously researched, research gaps are how these translate into practice and what practical preconditions are. Therefore, this qualitative research looked at which preconditions in practice affect the mechanisms used in different anti-discrimination interventions for primary education. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 developers and/or implementers of these interventions. Respondents work at 10 different municipal anti-discrimination facilities and 8 different non-governmental initiatives. A social ecological approach was used to guide the analysis, which shows the different levels that influence individual change. This is not only dependent on intrapersonal factors, but also, and in this case even more so, on interpersonal and structural factors. Results were divided into 1) preconditions specific to particular mechanisms and 2) general preconditions that apply to all mechanisms. For the first category, example preconditions are making it fun and exciting for the mechanism of insight into differences and similarities and having a common goal for the mechanism of meeting or having contact. For the second category, preconditions were mostly related to the guest teacher or speaker and the permanent teacher. Some important general preconditions turn out to be: a safe atmosphere in the classroom, an educated guest teacher and a school (management) that acknowledges the theme of prejudice and discrimination. In conclusion, especially preconditions regarding the people in children’s environment are important in reducing prejudice and discrimination among children. However, most preconditions seem to be enhancing rather than necessary. Theoretical and practical preconditions do not have to be separated as they can be intertwined."
"A systematic review examining risk factors for depression in sexual and  gender minority subgroups: Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual sub-group analysis.","['Thompson, Faith']","['Wit, John de']",2022-10-24T13:01:00Z,EN,"['Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Depression, Minority stress']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Depression rates among lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people are higher than in cisgender 
heterosexuals. Despite the need for targeted research that can be translated into specific 
interventions, these discrete sexual minorities are often grouped together. By not 
distinguishing, subgroup differences regarding the risk factors contributing to depression 
are obscured, and resources are not optimally focused to subgroup distinctions. This 
systematic review challenges this tradition by separating out data on lesbian, gay and 
bisexual men and women in relation to risk factors for depression. An extensive search 
across PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO was conducted by two reviewers. Findings from 39 
papers suggest that LGB populations share several minority stress related risk factors and 
that the most researched risk factors, and the risk factors with the strongest association for 
depression, fall consistently within the minority stress framework (Meyer, 2003). For
lesbians, an absence of self-esteem was most associated with depression. For gay men 
internalised homophobia and for bisexual women bi-negativity was most associated with 
depression. While coming-out/disclosure of sexual identity was most associated with 
depression for bisexual men. The data does contain a number of inconsistencies, with over 
half of the 39 included studies including gay men (69.2%) and the least including bisexual 
men (25.64%). Data lacked reporting on race/ethnicity across contexts and most studies 
received mid/low-quality ratings, based on The Newcastle - Ottawa Quality Assessment 
Scale evaluation from two reviewers, due to a reliance on convenience sampling strategies
and a lack of controls. Overall, this review provides a breakdown of risk factors for 
depression in LGB sub-populations and further urges researchers to follow this approach in 
the future to uncover both research bias and the unique ways in which minority stress, and 
other risk factors, may affect the mental health needs of sexual minority subgroups."

Additionally, it was examined whether amount of visits by family carer (FC) influenced QoL, and whether this relationship was moderated by rural NHs. Data collected by Trimbos Institute (2019-2020) was used to test hypotheses. Four datasets (PwD, FC, NH’s manager and care staff) were merged into one dataset. Only suitable data was used which resulted in a subset for the current study (N = 261). A multi-level regression analysis tested the predictors of QoL. Moreover, an interaction effect between amount of visits by FC and location of the NHs is included. Results from the multi-level regression analysis showed that independency on activities of daily living, amount of visits by FC, perceptions of the caregiving role by FC, small scale care, facility size and location of the NH did not significantly influence QoL of PwD. Additionally, no support was found for the interaction effect.  Although relationships were congruent with previous research, no significant effects were found. Possible explanations for the unexpected outcomes were addressed. This study contributed to the research field by using an holistic approach. Future researchers are advised to expand on research on QoL according to the SEM. Moreover, it is advised to revise research design methods. Finally, as previous research identified differences in QoL of PwD by NHs’ location, it is advised that policy makers and health care professionals reconsider health care policies."

This study explores the effect of structural integration – determined by educational attainment 
– on (negative) experiences (such as discrimination, sense of belonging, feelings about 
hospitality and angriness due to the disadvantaged position of migrants) in the Netherlands, to 
shed light on the possible existence of an ‘integration paradox’ in the Netherlands. Using the 
framework of classical integration as well as the framework of relative deprivation, possible 
outcome expectations are predicted. Using the NIS2NL dataset, linear and logistic regressions 
are performed to test the effect of education on (negative) experiences. Next, mediation 
analyses are conducted to explain these findings. Structural integration is found to have a 
negative effect on sense of belonging and a positive effect on angriness due to the 
disadvantaged position, which suggest that there is evidence to confirm an integration 
paradox. The study however also finds that structural integration has a positive effect on 
feelings about hospitality, which suggests that there would not be an integration paradox at 
play. The study concludes that there is an integration paradox at play in the Netherlands, but 
that it is quite nuanced and only visible when studying certain immigrant experiences."
The effect of perceived opinions of relatives on the social integration of migrants in the Netherlands: Based on participation in associations and minority-majority contacts,"['Spruijt, Naomi']","['Wit, John de']",2022-10-24T13:00:55Z,EN,"['social integration, relatives, bridging social capital, migrants']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Pressure from relatives could withhold migrants from gaining bridging social capital, since family is shown to be an important factor regarding the integration of migrants (Kalmijn, 2019). Bridging social capital is positively associated with better social integration and opportunities in the host society for migrants (Kalmijn, 2019; Kogan, 2016; Lancee, 2010; Maliepaard et al., 2017; WODC, 2007). A way to increase bridging social capital is participating in associations and obtaining minority-majority contacts (Handy & Greenspan, 2008; Lancee, 2010). However, little focus is found in existing research on whether pressure from relatives affects minority-majority contacts and the participation in associations and thus social integration. Therefore, this research focuses on the influence of the perceived opinions of relatives on the participation in majority group associations and minority-majority contacts for migrants. Existing data from LISS database was used, obtained via an online survey among migrants in the Netherlands, on which a linear regression and two binary logistic regression analyses were performed. No significant relation was found between the perceived opinions and minority-majority contacts. Significant influence was found regarding the effect of perceived opinions on the participation in associations and the effect of minority-majority contacts on the participation in associations. Based on the results it can be concluded that minority- majority contacts stimulate social integration through participating in associations with majority group members. Migrants with more minority-majority contacts participate more in associations then migrants with less minority-majority contacts. Further research could provide more insights regarding these results."

Agreeableness (β = -.178, p = .024), conscientiousness (β = -.236, p = .003), neuroticism (β = .163, p < .001) and the interaction between agreeableness and conscientiousness (β = .338, p= .008) were found to be significant predictors. Extraversion (β = -.011, p = .400) was not significantly associated with changes in emotional loneliness.While the majority of personality traits significantly predicted changes in social and emotional loneliness, the amount of additional explained variance by these traits was fairly small (ϪR2 = .019 for social loneliness, ϪR2 = .025 for emotional loneliness). This was probably due to the research controlling for the previous years’ loneliness scores. This research did, however, unveil the necessity for loneliness research to analyze social and emotional loneliness separately."
Who is taking care of the elderly? Looking at facilitators and barriers in the relation between migration and care behaviour for elderly parents,"['Platenkamp, Imke']","['Wit, John de']",2022-10-24T13:00:51Z,EN,"['Care behaviour, Migration, Filial obligation, Gender, Expectations of parents']",Social Policy and Public Health,"This quantitative study explores to what extent filial obligation, expectations of parents, gender and education level strengthen or weaken caring behaviour for elderly parents for migrants and non-migrants. Previous models show a link between migration, filial obligation and care behaviour, but expectations of parents, gender and education have not been combined with migration as an predictor for care behaviour. 
	To check the hypotheses, data from the LISS panel has been used (N=234). Linear regression and hierarchical linear regression are used to analyze the data. From analyzing the data it can be concluded that being a migrant is positively linked with care behaviour. Only the interaction-effect of migration with expectations of parents was significant. Meaning that the other variables did not influence the relationship between migration and care behaviour. However, age, migration, filial obligation and expectations of parents are positive predictors for care behaviour.
	To move towards a participatory society in which family care is emphasized. Policy and interventions could focus on migration, filial obligation, age and the expectations of parents. Since this study shows that these are the main predictors for more care behaviour, a qualitative research of these predictors is recommended to get a better understanding of the rationale for this."
GENDER AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY,"['Sybesma, Lotte']","['Kamphuis, Carlijn']",2022-10-24T13:00:59Z,EN,"['physical activity, gender, social networks']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Physical activity (PA) is protective for health, but many Dutch people do not exercise regularly. This study investigated possible gender differences in recreational PA, and whether these gender differences can be explained by social network characteristics. The study aimed to answer the question: To what extent do gender differences in recreational PA levels exist, and can these differences be explained by social network characteristics (perceived social support, network homogeneity, and network size)? Survey data from the GLOBE study from 2014 were used to answer the research question, resulting in a sample of 2,812 Dutch adults. Linear regression and mediation analyses were performed to answer the research question. The analyses showed that women walk and bike more than men, but men work around the house and practice sports more. Network homogeneity and network size are significantly associated with walking, biking, and practicing sports for leisure. Men have more homogeneous, but smaller networks than women, and women perceive more social support than men. Network homogeneity partly mediates the relationship between gender and walking, but no other network characteristics mediate a relationship between gender and PA. The findings from this study prove that the social network is a protective factor for PA and can be used as a tool in exercise promotion programs tailored to men and women."
Een gedeelde visie: een stem voor iedereen?,"['Leusink, Tijn']","['Geuijen, Karin']",2022-07-22T00:01:11Z,NL,['netwerksamenwerking; gedeelde visie; participatieve inclusiviteit; procestransparantie; macht/middelen ongelijkheid; facilitair leiderschap'],Publiek management,"De netwerksamenwerking van het sociaal domein Drechtsteden, met onder andere de Sociale Dienst Drechtsteden (SDD) en de Drechtstedengemeenten als stakeholders, werkt vanaf begin 2022 vanuit een nieuwe gemeenschappelijke regeling. Waar het bevoegd gezag over beleid voorheen bij een gemeenschappelijke Drechtraad lag, ligt dit vanaf 1 januari bij de gemeenteraden zelf (Drechtsteden, 2021b, p. 2). Dit is opvallend, omdat de Drechtraad in 2019 instemde met een regionale visie waarin de inwoner centraal gesteld wordt, iets wat intensieve samenwerking vergt (sociaal domein Drechtsteden, 2019). Gemeenteraden ervoeren echter dat zij onvoldoende konden sturen op de beoogde doelen in het sociaal domein, wat resulteerde in de wens naar lokale sturing (Drechtsteden, 2021a, p. 3). Volgens de literatuur zou een gedeelde visie de doelstellingen van stakeholders echter moeten samenbrengen (Ansell & Gash, 2008; Emerson & Nabatchi, 2015). Deze tegenstelling tussen theorie en praktijk heeft geleid tot de volgende onderzoeksvraag: Op welke manier draagt een gedeelde visie bij aan de netwerksamenwerking tussen de Sociale Dienst Drechtsteden en de Drechtstedengemeenten?
Deze onderzoeksvraag is beantwoord middels een documentenanalyse en interviews met ambtenaren van de SDD en gemeenten. Hieruit blijkt dat een gedeelde visie kan dienen als rode draad en dat deze kan bijdragen aan de samenwerking wanneer die gekoppeld zou worden aan de uitvoering. Daarnaast blijkt dat een gedeelde visie alleen van waarde is wanneer deze ook wordt ervaren als gedeeld. Dit is niet het geval bij de regionale visie, die vooral wordt gezien als een visie van de SDD. Er werd al jarenlang afstand ervaren tussen de stakeholders en daarnaast voelden gemeenteraden zich niet gehoord. Er was sprake van een disbalans van macht en middelen, en een gebrek aan participatieve inclusiviteit en procestransparantie. De sturende leiderschapsrol van de SDD heeft dit verder versterkt: in deze rol heeft de SDD onvoldoende ingezet op het faciliteren van deze aspecten.
De bevindingen laten zien dat een gedeelde visie alleen kan bijdragen aan netwerksamenwerking wanneer er voldoende aandacht is voor deze onderdelen, omdat de visie anders als illegitiem wordt ervaren. In dat geval werkt een gedeelde visie averechts en belemmert deze de samenwerking: stakeholders gaan op zoek naar andere manieren om hun doelen te behalen. De tijd en energie die in het proces van een gedeelde visie zijn gestoken, hadden beter besteed kunnen worden aan het bevorderen van de positie van minder machtige stakeholders en het ontwikkelen van een inclusief en transparant collaboratief proces. De netwerksamenwerking wordt op basis van deze bevindingen aanbevolen om één of meerdere facilitair leiders van buitenaf aan te stellen met de opdracht extra aandacht te besteden aan macht/middelen ongelijkheden, participatieve inclusiviteit en procestransparantie. Daarnaast wordt de SDD aanbevolen om gemeenten beter te betrekken bij het werk dat zij doen en de keuzemogelijkheden in het sociaal domein.
Bij toepassing van deze bevindingen moet er rekening worden gehouden met drie beperkingen van het onderzoek die maken dat resultaten niet blindelings overdraagbaar zijn. Allereerst is de onderzochte casus een zeer unieke netwerksamenwerking vanwege de getrapte volksvertegenwoordiging in de Drechtraad. Ten tweede kan de transitie naar een nieuwe gemeenschappelijke regeling niet volledig worden gevangen in de beperkte omvang van dit onderzoek. Tot slot is het aantal respondenten beperkt, zijn er vooral beleidsambtenaren geïnterviewd en geen gemeenteraadsleden of bestuurders, en beperkt het onderzoek zich tot de SDD en gemeenten en zijn andere stakeholders in de netwerksamenwerking niet onderzocht. Een suggestie is om te onderzoeken hoe andere stakeholders de macht/middelen ongelijkheden of participatieve inclusiviteit ervaren."

Het doel van het huidige onderzoek was om te onderzoeken of ervaren sociale steun en gezinssamenstelling verklarend zijn voor de mentale gezondheid van Nederlandse jongvolwassenen in de leeftijd van 18 tot 25 jaar tijdens de COVID-19-pandemie. Daarnaast werd onderzocht of gezinssamenstelling een moderator is in de relatie tussen sociale steun en mentale gezondheid. Een cross-sectionele studie onder 466 Nederlandse jongvolwassenen (Mleeftijd = 21.37) werd uitgevoerd van juni 2020 tot december 2020 met een online vragenlijst over sociale steun, sekse, gezinssamenstelling en mentale gezondheid. T-toetsen lieten zien dat alleenwonenden niet minder sociale steun ervaarden, en dat mannen significant hoger scoorden op mentale gezondheid. Een hiërarchische regressie analyse liet zien dat sekse een negatieve verklarende variabele was voor mentale gezondheid, en dat sociale steun een positieve verklarende variabele voor mentale gezondheid was. Gezinssamenstelling was geen verklarende variabele voor mentale gezondheid. Ook bleek gezinssamenstelling als moderator in de relatie tussen sociale steun en mentale gezondheid niet significant. Jongvolwassen mannen en jongvolwassenen die meer sociale steun ontvingen, hadden een betere mentale gezondheid. Alleenwonenden hadden geen verminderde mentale gezondheid ten opzichte van jongvolwassenen die samenwoonden, en voor alleenwonenden was er geen sterker verband tussen sociale steun en mentale gezondheid.

European Wildcats in Limburg,"['Schoufour, Bram']","['Cromsigt, Joris']",2022-07-22T00:01:23Z,EN,[],Sustainable Development,"The European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) recently returned to forests in Limburg
after being locally extinct in the Netherlands for more than a thous and years. Wildcats
are beneficial for biodiversity because they can function as an umbrella and flagship
species in conservation efforts. To facilitate a stable metapopulation of wildcats in the
Netherlands, more knowledge is needed on wildcat presence, habitat quality and
corridors. In this study, I determined wildcat presence with a camera trap study in
forests in Zuid-Limburg. I found six wildcats in Vijlenerbos, and one each in Savelsbos,
Groote Bosch and De Molt in the Bovenste Bosketen. These are the first confirmed
sightings of wildcats in Savelsbos and Groote Bosch. Additionally, I applied an existing
habitat suitability model to analyse suitable wildcat home ran ges in the province of
Limburg. I found that habitat patches are suboptimal in Zuid-Limburg, even though it is
the only region in the Netherlands where wildcats are currently present. The most
important reasons for the low habitat quality is that forest patches are either too small
or too close to villages. Using a least-cost path analysis, I identified a connection
network for forests in Zuid-Limburg and the major obstacles where green corridors can
be established to improve the connectivity of small forest patches in Zuid-Limburg. With
these green corridors, there are more opportunities for wildcat dispersion, and forests
in Zuid-Limburg can hold a wildcat subpopulation. In Noord-Limburg, I identified 13
suitable home ranges with a total area of 276 km2
, which can hold an accumulative
subpopulation size of 76-137 wildcats. An analysis of the least-cost pathways through
Limburg revealed that villages and roads in Zuid-Limburg act as major obstacles for
wildcat dispersal. The most feasible routes to the potential home ranges in NoordLimburg might through Germany and Belgium. Therefore, international cooperation is
of vital importance when designing a corridor plan for wildcats and other species in the
Netherlands."
The legitimation of digital platforms across different markets in the Netherlands,"['Schaik, Maurits van']","['Punt, Matthijs']",2022-07-22T00:01:21Z,EN,['digital platforms; legitimacy spillovers; legitimation; digital innovation; transposition'],Innovation Sciences,"Digital platforms such as Uber, Deliveroo and Airbnb are part and parcel of present times.
Previous studies mention how digital platforms transcend market boundaries, making them
‘market-agnostic’. Practice has shown how digital platforms often disrupt the markets that
they enter, thereby formulating new rules of the game. This forms a discrepancy with what
is proclaimed in institutional theory, that is, an organization needs to conform to its
institutional environment to be perceived as legitimate. While existing literature is often
concerned with studying the legitimation of platforms through case studies that take place
in a single market, how the legitimation of digital platforms is affected on a macro-level
has hitherto remained unexplored. Hence, this study addresses the current gap in the
literature by examining how digital platforms leverage legitimacy spillovers from markets.
More formally, the study asks: to what extent does the market entry of a digital platform
in the Netherlands depends on external legitimacy spillovers? In defining external
legitimacy spillovers, the theoretical perspectives of institutional theory and organizational
ecology are synthesized in the form of the density dependence model. This study
specifically extents the basic density dependence model by taking the markets where the
platforms are active in as unit of analysis. In the model, the density of platforms in a
market is used as a proxy for legitimacy spillovers and competition. The model is applied
in the form of logistic regression analyses on two samples during the period of 2010 to
2020: the population of gig platforms and the population of sharing platforms in the
Netherlands. The results prove that digital platforms benefit from legitimacy spillovers by
other platforms in the same market on the short term, while concomitantly being
negatively affected by spillover effects from other markets. However, as local competition
between platforms becomes more intense, subsequent market entry also becomes
dependent on legitimacy spillovers from platforms in other markets. This study suggests
that the latter effect is induced by platforms that engage in institutional transposition,
which denotes the process in which the status and experience garnered in one market is
converted to another dimension. These results are integrated into a proposed visual model
that illustrates the relationship between digital platforms and spillover effects within and
between markets. In doing so, this study marks the beginning of uncovering how digital
platforms can leverage legitimacy spillovers from markets through transposition."

This study aims at understanding the role of the three components of organizational commitment (i.e., affective, normative, and continuance commitment) and job satisfaction as a mediator between work engagement and Organizational Citizenship Behaviors (OCB). Within this cross-sectional study, the data (N =151) was analyzed via a parallel mediation analysis using the PROCESS-tool. Drawing upon the Social Exchange Theory, the current study found evidence that work engagement positively relates to OCB. Moreover, affective commitment was found to partially mediate the relation between work engagement and OCB. However, normative and continuance commitment were not found to mediate the relationship. In addition, job satisfaction was not a significant mediator through which work engagement affects OCB. This study contributes to existing literature as it is among the first to provide insight into the role of all three components of organizational commitment and job satisfaction on the proposed work engagement – OCB relation. Implications for results and suggestions for further research are discussed. As affective commitment is found to mediate the relation between work engagement and OCB, the importance of identification with, involvement in, and emotional attachment towards organizations is underlined for managers and organizations in order to increase OCB among engaged employees."

Programmes that focus on important life skills of adolescents in humanitarian crisis and on their social environment have the potential to address the specific needs adolescents have in humanitarian settings. Though, high quality research on the effectiveness of life skills intervention is still lacking. Therefore, Plan International’s ‘Parenting and Adolescents Life Skill’ (PALS) programme was evaluated in this study, which focuses on both the life skills of adolescents and the parenting skills of their parents or caregivers. First, quantitative Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) data was analysed to evaluate the effectiveness of the PALS programme and to identify areas of improvement. This data was gathered during the implementation of the programme from the adolescents and parents or caregivers that completed the programme. Second, qualitative data from conducted interviews with programme implementers were analysed that provided a broader view of the improvements for the PALS programme that the M&E data could not provide alone. Furthermore, recommendations were asked for the implementation  of these improvements. The findings of this evaluation study showed that life skills interventions for adolescents that include actors from their social environment can be effective to address their specific needs in humanitarian crisis. Additionally, implementation strategies, the capacity of programme implementers, and the additional value of M&E tools should be kept in mind when developing and implementing humanitarian programming."

This study aimed to examine the relationship between task interdependence and job satisfaction when the SDT needs were present. Two organisational psychology master’s students conducted a cross-sectional study and gathered 132 participants of 18 years old and older from multiple countries and industries. Contrary to the expectations, there was no association between task interdependence and job satisfaction. There was also no interaction of task interdependence and autonomy on job satisfaction. However, when employee competence and relatedness were present, there was an interaction between high task interdependence and job satisfaction. Lack of power due to an insufficient number of participants may be seen as a critical factor in the results, although other limitations were explored. Future lines of research are discussed to fully understand why task interdependence may affect employees’ job satisfaction when autonomy, relatedness, and competence are supported."

Dit fenomeen wordt door historici ook wel ‘anglofilie’ genoemd. Kort omschreven houdt anglofilie in dat in de Verenigde Staten een bepaalde waardering bestaat voor de Engelse cultuur. Dit onderzoek richt zich op dit begrip anglofilie. Het doel van mijn onderzoek is het schetsen van een beeld hoe anglofilie, zoals die in de academische literatuur omschreven wordt, terug te vinden is in de Verenigde Staten van de eenentwintigste eeuw, en dan specifiek in Amerikaanse fan-pagina’s, magazines en kranten.  Het onderzoek biedt niet alleen een historische weergave van het begrip anglofilie, maar laat ook zien dat anglofilie in de eenentwintigste eeuw nog te vinden is in de Verenigde Staten. 
Als onderzoeksmateriaal heb ik gekozen voor casussen uit de Engelse mediawereld, namelijk zogenaamde Engelse heritage films en series. Dit genre films en series zijn vaak gebaseerd op klassieke literaire werken, geassocieerd met historische kostuumdrama’s. Heritage films en series geven echter geen weergave van een werkelijke geschiedenis, maar ze schetsen een ideaalbeeld, ofwel een mythisch beeld van de Engelse cultuur en het Engeland uit oudere tijden. Voor dit onderzoek is er gekozen voor drie Engelse heritage films en series, namelijk Pride and Prejudice (2005), The King’s Speech (2010) en Downton Abbey (2010-2015). De focus ligt hierbij echter niet op de inhoud van de films en series zelf maar op de discoursen en debatten eromheen. Deze discoursen en debatten zijn te vinden op artikelen van Amerikaanse websites van kranten en magazines die gaan over anglofilie en de groeiende populariteit van bovengenoemde heritage films en series in de VS. 
Het onderzoek is onderverdeeld in drie hoofdstukken, waarbij elk hoofdstuk zijn eigen thema heeft met betrekking tot anglofilie. Deze thema’s komen voort uit de academische literatuur en zijn tevens meermaals terug te vinden in de Amerikaanse bronnen. In het eerste hoofdstuk staat de performativiteit van anglofilie centraal. Het tweede hoofdstuk gaat over het ideaalbeeld van Engeland dat geconstrueerd wordt in de Amerikaanse bronnen. Tenslotte kijk ik in het derde hoofdstuk naar de manier waarop anglofilie fungeert als kritiek op de Amerikaanse cultuur en maatschappij. Op basis van mijn bronnenonderzoek stel ik dat er nog steeds sprake is van anglofilie in de VS van de eenentwintigste eeuw, waarbij die te vinden is in artikelen van Amerikaanse websites van kranten en magazines, maar ook in Amerikaanse fan-pagina en conferenties die zich focussen op de Engelse cultuur. Er zijn echter enkele verschillen te constateren tussen het begrip anglofilie dat in de academische literatuur beschreven wordt en de uitingen van anglofilie zoals die in de bronnen te vinden zijn, bijvoorbeeld de connectie met een specifieke politieke ideologie."

Historisch en theoretisch gezien is een first past the post-systeem vrijwel onvatbaar voor grote hervormingen, omdat de partijen die hervorming zouden moeten doorvoeren zelf het meest profiteren van de status quo. De dynamieken die de politiek ertoe bracht om een bindend referendum over fundamentele kiesstelselhervorming voor te leggen aan de kiezers, is door analyse van act contingent factoren toch inzichtelijk te maken. Een reeks gebeurtenissen die volgde na inherente en uitvergrote systeemgebreken, begon na een toonaangevend rapport van een Royal Commission. De radicale aanbeveling tot hervormingen die het rapport bevatte, werden door de twee grote partijen in eerste instantie gebruikt om electoraal gewin mee te behalen. Toen beide partijen zich hadden gecommitteerd aan de belofte voor een referendum hierover, zou eenzijdig afstand doen van deze belofte zware electorale verliezen betekenen. Na een klinkende overwinning voor verandering van kiessysteem in een indicatief referendum in 1992, stemde een meerderheid van de Nieuw-Zeelandse kiezers in 1993 in een bindend referendum voor vervanging van het oude kiessysteem door een radicaal nieuwe. Dit onderzoek laat zien dat aanvullend onderscheid tussen negatieve en positieve act contingency zinvol is, en dat in het geval van Nieuw-Zeeland een consultatief proces meer invloed had op factoren van act contingency dan andersom."
Borstkanker belichaamd in verhalen,"['Hage, Lisa']","['Sonnenschein, Johan']",2022-07-23T00:01:37Z,NL,['borstkanker; medical humanities; discoursanalyse; bibliotherapie; life writing; Susan Sontag; Arthur W. Frank;'],Nederlandse Literatuur en Cultuur,"In deze scriptie wordt antwoord gegeven op de vraag hoe borstkankernarratieven zich tot het vermeende toxische borstkankerdiscours verhouden. Het startpunt van het onderzoek is tweeledig. Enerzijds ga ik uit van het gegeven dat er veel psychische klachten bij patiënten met borstkanker ontstaan en van het gebruik van literatuur als methode ter verlichting van deze klachten. Anderzijds ga ik uit van een vermeend toxisch (borst)kankerdiscours, zoals dat is beschreven door Susan Sontag, Arthur W. Frank en G. Thomas Couser. 
Susan Sontag stelt dat er sprake is van een toxisch discours dat door metaforen wordt gevormd, en dat een negatieve invloed heeft op de behandeling van en het morele oordeel over de patiënt. Arthur W. Frank stelt dat er sprake is van een toxisch discours, waarbij er eindeloos gestreefd wordt naar herstel en de patiënt door het jargon van de medische wetenschap wordt gekoloniseerd. G. Thomas Couser stelt ten slotte ook dat er sprake is van een negatieve beeldvorming, waarbij de vrouwelijke patiënt door zowel haar geslacht als gezondheid wordt gemarginaliseerd. 
Een narratief dat volgens Frank het meest ideaal is voor dekolonisatie van patiënten, is een zoektochtnarratief dat wordt verteld door een verteller via een communicatief lichaam. De verteller heeft als communicatief lichaam een ziektenarratief waarbij er sprake is van verlangen, het toeval wordt omarmd, er een dyadische ziektebeleving is en de verteller geassocieerd is met zijn lichaam. Hierbij worden het dominerende lichaam, het spiegelende lichaam en het gedisciplineerde lichaam als minder ideaal beschouwd, omdat zij in het ziektenarratief niet dezelfde vier kenmerken hebben. Ook het chaotische lichaam is niet ideaal omdat het geen narratieve structuur meer kent. De combinatie van het communicatieve lichaam met het zoektochtnarratief, waarbij de ziekte als reis wordt beschouwd, draagt er het meest aan bij dat de lezer ook een communicatief lichaam wordt en daarmee zijn stem terugvindt. 
Om boeken te kunnen inzetten als bibliotherapie bij borstkanker dienen deze aan te sluiten bij de ervaringen van de patiënt met borstkanker en dus over deze ziekte te gaan. Daarom richt dit onderzoek zich op life writing borstkankernarratieven. Uit bibliotherapeutische bronnen blijkt dat reflectieve teksten leiden tot meer reflectie bij de lezer op zijn eigen proces. In het geval van borstkanker leiden reflectieve teksten dus tot (meer) reflectie op het eigen ziekteproces. De teksten faciliteren daarmee (de)kolonisatie binnen de ziekte-ervaringen van de patiënt.
Uit de bronnen blijkt het discours zoals Frank, Sontag en Couser dat beschreven nog te bestaan. De auteurs tonen vaak een gedisciplineerd lichaam als verteller en maken gebruik van metaforen als eufemisme voor hun borstkanker. Hiermee houden deze teksten het discours in stand. Hoewel de auteurs ook vaak gebruik maken van een communicatief lichaam mist hierbij de nodige reflectie. In de teksten is tegelijkertijd, door reflectie, ook kritiek op het discours te vinden. Het reflecteren op het eigen gedrag, of het bekritiseren van vertoond gedrag door artsen kan worden beschouwd als een bevrijding uit het door Sontag geschetste toxische discours."
De effecten van positieve interacties met leeftijdsgenoten op het welbevinden van kinderen in de kinderopvang en de rol van emotionele zelfregulatie,"['Verschuren, Marijntje']","['Romijn, Bodine']",2022-07-23T00:01:33Z,NL,[],"Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Achtergrond. De vraag naar de effecten van de kinderopvang op het welbevinden van kinderen is een steeds actuelere vraag geworden. Ten eerste omdat steeds meer kinderen naar de kinderopvang gaan en ten tweede omdat de eerste jaren voor het jonge kind een belangrijke basis leggen voor de verdere ontwikkeling van het kind. Doel. Het doel van deze studie is om te achterhalen of emotionele zelfregulatie een belangrijke modererende rol speelt op het welbevinden van kinderen en daarbij de cruciale rol van relaties met leeftijdsgenoten in de peutertijd meegenomen. Methode. Huidig onderzoek maakt gebruik van data uit een dieptestudie genaamd preCool, dat bestaat uit kinderen die in 2010 twee jaar werden gevolgd tot de leeftijd van vijf jaar. De onderzoeksgroep bestond uit 113 Nederlandse kinderen die op peuterspeelzalen of kinderdagverblijven zaten. De data is verzameld door verschillende observatiemeetinstrumenten. Emotionele zelfregulatie werd in dit onderzoek meegenomen als moderator. Een multipele regressieanalyse is gebruikt om de hoofdeffecten en het interactie-effect van de variabelen ‘interacties met leeftijdsgenoten’, ‘emotionele zelfregulatie’ en ‘welbevinden’ te meten. Resultaten. Huidig onderzoek toont aan dat positieve interacties met leeftijdsgenoten gepaard gaan met een hogere mate van welbevinden bij peuters op het kinderdagverblijf. Het toevoegen van emotionele zelfregulatie laat hierbij geen significant effect zien en de interactieterm laat ook geen gezamenlijk verband zien. Conclusie. Emotionele zelfregulatie speelt geen modererende rol op het welbevinden van kinderen. Wel blijken positieve interacties met leeftijdsgenoten een belangrijke voorspeller voor het welbevinden van kinderen op de Nederlandse kinderopvang."
Mind the gap: the difference between policy goals and implementation around fitting education for gifted students,"['Vleeskens, Marijn']","['Barsegyan, Vardan']",2022-07-23T00:01:32Z,EN,"['Policy-implementation gap, fitting education for gifted students, regional partnerships']",Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems,"The gap between policy goals and implementation is one of the main reasons for policy failure. Fitting education for gifted students has emerged as a relatively new policy field in the past decade in the Netherlands. This is partly a result of a report that showed that Dutch education does not meet the needs of gifted students, which often causes social-emotional problems and underperformance for these students. In the case of the policy on fitting education for gifted students, schools are concerned with the implementation of the policy goals that the regional partnerships these schools are part of formulated in 2019. In this study, the policy-implementation gap was examined by analysing data on partnership goals (n=122) that were combined with data on schools and their implementation of the policy (n=1046). The policy goals were compared to the actual implementation, resulting in a measurement of the policy-implementation gap. Results of univariate statistical analysis showed that there is indeed a gap between the policy goals as formulated by partnerships and implementation of policy goals by schools. The gap mainly presents itself in the policy goals that take more effort, time, and money to implement. Additionally, six hypotheses were tested on the effect of school involvement with policy-making, school support for policy goals, and school satisfaction with the partnership and the moderating effect of the level of centralization on these effects. Results of multiple regression analysis showed that there was not enough evidence to reject the null hypotheses in favour of the formulated alternative hypotheses. Regression analysis did show that the policy-implementation gap is larger for secondary schools and for larger partnerships. Based on these results, three policy recommendations on teacher education programs, monitoring within secondary schools, and monitoring and close contact with schools in large partnerships were formulated."

Experiencing affective reactions: How can negative affect predict goal pursuit after self-control failure?,"['Pearson, Jessica']","['Gillebaart, Marleen']",2022-07-26T00:00:45Z,EN,"['self-control failure, negative affect, positive affect, goal pursuit, mediation']","Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Self-control is crucial in understanding human behaviour and reasoning. It has a huge impact on one’s mental as well as physical well-being, among many other areas. However, it is inevitable to experience self-control failure, where we give in to temptations that hinder us in our goal pursuit. Such a failure does not have to be seen as a defeat – some may actually come out stronger and become more confident in pursuing their goal. Nevertheless, some decide to quit after failing once or multiple times.  The current study focussed on the process of self-control failure in goal pursuit, and how negative emotions experienced after self-control failure predict goal pursuit. This mediating effect was explored through means of an online questionnaire, which covered the (1) main characteristics of the participants, (2) self-control failure, (3) goal pursuit, and (4) the PANAS scale, (5) importance of the goal, and (6) type of goal. The results showed no significant effect for a mediation of negative affect in goal pursuit only a significant (negative) direct effect between self-control failure and goal pursuit. Therefore, the hypothesis was not supported. An exploratory analysis was performed, where positive affect was examined as the mediator. These did give a significant negative mediation effect, meaning that not experiencing positive affect after self-control failure would negatively predict goal pursuit. Unfortunately, this study was severely underpowered, thus no definitive conclusions could be drawn. Further research with a larger sample size is needed to determine the actual significance of these effects."
Ongelijk Ontevreden? Een kwantitatief onderzoek naar de invloed van autonomie op de arbeidstevredenheid van artsen en verpleegkundigen.,"['Verhorevoort, Juul']","['Boer, Noortje de']",2022-07-26T00:00:49Z,NL,['Job autonomie; arbeidstevredenheid; professionaliteit; traditionele professionals;\nsemi-professionals; contactambtenaren'],Publiek management,"Door veranderingen in de Nederlandse zorgsector ligt de nadruk steeds meer op kwantiteit van de

zorgprofessionals. Echter, een universeel antwoord op de vraag welke factoren van invloed zijn op 
de arbeidstevredenheid van artsen en verpleegkundigen lijkt te ontbreken.

In dit onderzoek wordt er gekeken naar de invloed van autonomie op de arbeidstevredenheid bij 
artsen en verpleegkundigen. In het bijzonder wordt de rol van professionaliteit in de relatie tussen 
autonomie en arbeidstevredenheid bekeken. Dit wordt onderzocht door antwoord te geven op de 
onderzoeksvraag: “In hoeverre beïnvloedt autonomie de arbeidstevredenheid en wat is de rol van 
professionaliteit van artsen en verpleegkundigen hierin?” Het hebben van autonomie zou, volgens 
empirische onderzoeken en literatuurstudies, mogelijk van invloed kunnen zijn op de 
arbeidstevredenheid en daarmee op het tekort in de zorg. Op basis van de literatuur wordt ervan 
uitgegaan dat de invloed van professionaliteit sterker is bij artsen dan bij verpleegkundigen, omdat 
meer professionaliteit gepaard gaat met meer autonomie en mogelijk meer arbeidstevredenheid. 
De resultaten van dit kwantitatieve onderzoek, met behulp van een vragenlijst (n = 108), laten zien 
dat (1) autonomie een positieve invloed heeft op de arbeidstevredenheid van artsen en 
verpleegkundigen en dat (2) professionaliteit geen invloed heeft op deze relatie en dat deze invloed 
niet sterker is bij artsen dan bij verpleegkundigen."
"Using peer assessment in online

deciding which behavioural and

amount of work. The most applied evaluation tools in MOOCS therefore comes in the form
of peer assessment. This form of assessment is affected by a multitude of variables, which
have not always been accounted for in existing research. The present study aims to provide
a clear overview of knowledge and gaps on the different variables that affect peer
assessment, by categorizing these into behavioural and structural variables. Specifically, a
lack of knowledge exists on the behavioural variables affecting the peer assessment
process and outcomes. This knowledge is extended by empirical findings. The present
study consists of two parts with two different research methods: the first part provides a
structured overview of variables that affect peer assessment and identifies knowledge gaps
through a systematic literature review. To generate new insights on most particularly the
behavioural variables, three focus group sessions with university students were carried
out. During these focus groups, opinions and experiences with regard to peer assessment
were discussed. These focus group sessions comprise the second part of this research. This
paper especially contributes to existing knowledge by unravelling the variable motivation
and the potential ways to increase student motivations for thoroughly and truthfully
engaging in the peer assessment process. Although this study contributes to determining
how peer assessment is most optimally implemented, many ambiguities still exist around
the optimal implementation of certain variables. Therefore, providing a straightforward
advice for optimal course design is not reasonable, though a clear overview with
recommendations and trade-offs for each variable is given. The present study helps course
designers to decide which identified variables of peer assessment to implement in the
course, and remaining knowledge gaps are identified for which recommendations for future
research are made."
Balancing Costs and Driver Satisfaction in Cargo Train Driver Scheduling,"['Gottenbos, Mats']","['Hoogeveen, Han']",2022-07-26T00:00:57Z,EN,['driver scheduling; simulated annealing; robustness; driver satisfaction'],Computing Science,"This study considers the problem of scheduling cargo train drivers to perform a given set of activities, which is an important problem for our client Rail Force One. In this multi-objective problem, a trade-off must be found between monetary costs and driver satisfaction. Solutions must adhere to many real-world constraints, like maximum shift lengths, minimum resting times, contract hours, and driver qualifications. They must also deal with multiple types of drivers with different starting locations, varying salary rates throughout the time frame, and differing scheduling rules.
To solve this problem, we developed a simulated annealing algorithm to find high-quality schedules. This algorithm includes a simplified but high-performance robustness model that focuses on the idle time between consecutive activities, as well as a satisfaction score comprised of twelve criteria for each driver. By using varying weights between estimated costs and satisfaction throughout the simulated annealing search, a Pareto-optimal front of schedules is created representing the trade-off between the two objectives.
Experimental analysis using real-world data shows that the results of the algorithm are feasible and produced in acceptable runtimes. The generated schedules outperform the client's human-made schedules in cost-effectiveness, driver satisfaction and robustness. Consequently, the algorithm can reduce planning staff workload while increasing the client's profits and their drivers' satisfaction."

To get back to four-dimensional spacetime, we have to compactify the other dimensions. However, these compactifications typically lead to extra massless fields, the moduli, and we have to give them masses to get a phenomenological effective field theory. This is called moduli stabilization. In this thesis we will focus specifically on type IIB string theory compactified on so-called Calabi-Yau orientifolds. For this theory, the moduli can acquire masses by turning on extra background fields or fluxes. We will calculate the trace of these mass values corresponding to two of these moduli, the axio-dilaton and the complex structure moduli and try to find constraints for this trace. We then find that this can be written in terms of a special metric, called the Hodge metric. We also discuss further constraints on these moduli masses by relating them to the so-called flux number and looking at three special cases for the complex structure moduli space: the case of one complex structure modulus, the case of the complex structure moduli space as an Kähler-Einstein manifold and the case where we look at the boundary of the complex structure moduli space."

Visual literacy and nudges are two potential contributing factors to the ability to understand process models and reduce clutter. In this study, we researched by using an online questionnaire (N = 37) whether we could enhance the understanding of process models with the help of nudges, visual literacy and the interaction effects between the nudges and visual literacy. We executed a univariate ANOVA to compare the effect of the nudges on the understanding of process models with the two nudge conditions, visual literacy and all possible interactions as predictors. The results showed that nudges do not significantly influence the understanding of process models, whichwas not in line with our expectations. Visual literacy may have a significant influence, which aligns with our expectations. There was one significant interaction between visual literacy and the arrow nudge; however, not in the direction that we expected, therefore, not in line with our expectations. Given our small sample size, our significance could rest on a coincidence. We offer no open-and-shut conclusions about enhancing the understanding of process models with the help of nudges, visual literacy and the interaction effects between the nudges and visual literacy."
Explainable AI methods in clinical practice to obtain satisfactory performance and doctors’ confidence,"['Sobiczewska, Julita']","['Mosteiro Romero, Pablo']",2022-07-26T00:01:04Z,EN,['explainability AI; machine learning; clinical data; natural language processing;'],Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can greatly contribute to many fields of medicine by creating cutting-edge, efficient and effective methods to treat, monitor, and analyze patient records. Unfortunately, the lack of transparency of the models causes limited adoption of AI techniques in the treatment of patients. In order to use AI systems in medical practice, models that interpret the decisions made by these systems are applied. Such models are called Explainable AI (XAI).
This thesis presents a comprehensive analysis on application of XAI models in the medical field through literature review and experimental work. I carry out two clinical classification tasks to gain better understanding on which explainability methods and NLP models should be used in the different classification tasks in clinical practice to obtain satisfactory results and doctors’ confidence. Throughout the experiments I follow a framework proposed by Markus et al. with recommendations for choosing between different explainable AI methods.
Obtained results show that the framework with recommendations help with the decisions during study execution, but there are some ambiguities in the graph. This thesis points out the problem of non human-interpretable explanations. In addition, considerations and improvements to the previously proposed framework are presented."
Accelerating Sum Types,"['Hoef, Rick van']","['McDonell, Trevor']",2022-07-26T00:00:54Z,EN,[],Computing Science,"Parallel array languages are programming languages that make it possible to write highly parallel programs without knowing the intricacies of parallel programming and hardware. In this thesis, we present an optimization for the memory usage of parallel array languages, specifically geared towards sum types. Sum types are algebraic data types with more than one constructor, which are used to denote a choice between multiple different variants. Examples of applications of sum types in parallel programs are material choices in a ray tracer and parameters to a fluid simulation. We introduce a new representation of sum types that aligns with the struct-of-arrays memory layout that parallel array languages commonly use. We show that this representation is close to optimal with respect to memory usage, and that it is an improvement over existing representations that are suited for a struct-of-arrays memory layout. This representation is implemented in the POSable library, which generically converts non-recursive Haskell 98 data types to this representation. Accelerate is a functional parallel array language embedded in Haskell that supports sum types. The POSable library has been integrated in Accelerate, which shows the viability of the approach."

door wetenschappers als Tetsuya Matsubayashi en Michiko Ueda omschreven als “alarmerend”. Zij geven aan
dat suïcidaliteit een toenemend gezondheidsprobleem is, waar een oplossing voor gevonden moet
worden. Empathie en betrokkenheid bij het ziektebeeld worden hierbij als belangrijke componenten gezien om
de toename in suïcidaliteit tegen te gaan. Film kan mogelijk een rol spelen in het oproepen van deze
empathische gevoelens en betrokkenheid. Wetenschappers als Cole, Carlin en Carson beargumenteren dat film
de kijker in staat stelt om zich te verplaatsen in een patiënt, hetgeen begrip en empathie op kan roepen voor een
ziektebeeld. Daarnaast kan film emoties opwekken, erkenning geven of juist discussies aanwakkeren bij een
publiek, allen componenten die als essentieel worden ervaren in de bestrijding van suïcidaliteit.
Er is binnen het werkveld van de medical humanities echter nog weinig onderzoek gedaan naar de
specifieke relatie tussen film en suïcidaliteit en de bestaande onderzoeken zijn enkel kwantitatief van aard. Dit
betekent dat de manier waarop film de complexiteit van een suïcidaal ziektebeeld weer kan geven grotendeels
achterwegen blijft. Vandaar dat ik, door de film i’m thinking of ending things (2020) als casus te nemen, poog te
achterhalen hoe filmische middelen als, een onbetrouwbare verteller, crosscutting, mise-en-scène en metaforen,
ingezet kunnen worden om empathie en betrokkenheid bij een suïcidaal ziektebeeld te creëren. Hiervoor heb ik
gebruik gemaakt van de filmwetenschappelijke literatuur omtrent character interiority, oftewel de gedachten,
gevoelens of fantasieën van een karakter, en puzzelfilms, een genre dat de kijker actief betrekt bij de film door
de ontwikkelingen in het narratief als een puzzel te presenteren.
Uit de analyse is gebleken dat ITOET de mentale staat van een suïcidaal karakter tot een puzzel maakt,
die de kijker zelf moet oplossen. De vier filmische elementen vervullen hierbij allemaal een dubbelrol. Aan de
ene kant sluiten zij aan bij de kenmerken van een suïcidaal ziektebeeld terwijl zij tegelijkertijd dienen als
puzzelstukjes die de kijker aan elkaar moet verbinden. De kijker raakt nauwer betrokken bij de mentale staat, die
gepaard gaat met een suïcidaal ziektebeeld, doordat deze als een puzzel wordt gepresenteerd. Het publiek wordt
namelijk, in haar poging de puzzel op te lossen, onderdeel van de gedachtestroom van een suïcidaal karakter,
waardoor ITOET de kijker uitnodigt om de mentale staat van een suïcidaal karakter op zichzelf te betrekken. Op
deze manier poogt ITOET empathische gevoelens en een nauwere betrokkenheid bij een suïcidaal ziektebeeld te
creëren.
De resultaten van deze filmanalyse vormen de aanleiding voor mijn oproep om de
onderzoeksmethoden binnen de medical humanities te veranderen. Het is immers niet mogelijk om de relatie
tussen film en suïcidaliteit enkel op basis van de bestaande kwantitatieve methoden te achterhalen. Door middel
van filmwetenschappelijke theorie, als charachter interioriy en puzzelfilms, kan er onderzocht worden hoe het
medium filmische elementen in kan zetten om empathie en betrokkenheid op te wekken. Hierdoor kunnen
de medical humanities, op basis van het voorgestelde vervolgonderzoek, mogelijk bijdragen aan de strijd tegen
suïcidaliteit als toenemend gezondheidsprobleem."
Emotional response to climate hazards on Twitter,"['Jacobs, Marieke']","['Kleinhans, Maarten']",2022-07-28T01:01:53Z,EN,['Emotions; Linguistics; Artifical Intelligence; Climate Hazards; Public response; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Twitter;'],Earth Surface and Water,"In this study Twitter data have been analysed to gain information about public response to climate hazards by using artificial intelligence techniques. An increasing body of research has suggested that the processing of information, decision-making and action-taking, and behaviour with regards to climate change, hazards and risks are largely determined by emotions. This opens up the possibility to study the relation between climate hazards and emotional expressions, responses and effects. Understanding tweet activity and its associated emotions before, during and after climate hazards can have significant implications for interventions towards preparedness, safety, regulations and recovery during future climate hazards. In addition to global response, information about tweet activity and emotional response in different regions can add to these implications and interventions. Twitter is chosen as social network forum due to its global usage, the current purpose of Twitter with regards to sharing opinions and expressions, the coverage of a very wide range of topics and the fact that the analysis of a large amount of data is facilitated for scientific purposes.
The main question of this thesis is as follows: How does the public respond (emotionally) to climate hazards on Twitter? 

First a literature study was conducted that discusses climate change and natural hazards, psychology of emotions and behaviour and its link to climate change and the expression and recognition of emotions in linguistics. This is followed by an outline of previous research regarding climate hazards, social media and emotions.
Concepts from literature regarding emotions and emotion recognition were integrated to collect and analyse Tweet datasets from Twitter for three different climate hazards. Tweets were collected before, during and after these climate hazards. Tweet datasets were collected by selection on specific words, start and end date and locations. This was followed by the extraction of emotions from the tweet texts in these datasets. The resulting tweet and emotion data were analysed to identify patterns regarding tweet activity and emotional response. Three climate hazards were selected: A sudden temperature rise on Antarctica, a Tornado outbreak in South West USA and Hurricane Ida in South West USA. All three events were short-lasting events that lasted between 1-3 days to be able to analyse the tweet and emotion trend before, during and after the event on a 4-week timescale. Tweet activity peak during the core event and show a gradual decrease during the recovery phase. The results show that the emotion anger is substantially larger for the hurricane and tornado cases in comparison with the Antarctica case, which can be explained by the visible impacts during the hurricane and tornado hazards and the association of hurricanes and tornadoes to climate hazards. The tornado event shows substantially more fearful reactions than the hurricane event. It is suggested that this difference in fear and anger proportions lies in the predictability or controllability of the event. The found tweet activity and emotional response patterns in this thesis can be useful for governments and organisations to communicate more effectively with the public by aiming for better preparation and recovery of climate hazards and also enhancing positive attitude towards climate change topics."

a warming climate and human-driven subsidence, a consequent from engineering and
damming the natural flow and cycle of river systems. In addition to housing a vast biodiversity,
attenuating storm surges and holding a large economic value, wetlands also act as the largest
carbon sink per hectare. The Mississippi Delta has long undergone severe land and wetland
loss with 5000 km2 of wetlands disappearing from the Louisiana coastlines. A multiproxy
approach using bulk sediment, geochemical and palynological analyses has been conducted
on a 38.7 m core taken during the installation of a subsidence monitoring superstation close
to the Mississippi River, southeast of New Orleans. This new data, in addition to previous
stratigraphic lithology description, has been used to interpret the depositional evolution of
the Holocene Mississippi River Delta (MRD) and explore the carbon storage potential of the
delta environment. An initial Holocene transgression between 38.7 and 28 m has been
interpreted. Increased fluvial input into the coastal marine realm, but remaining within a pro
delta environment between 27 and 19.5 m is inferred primarily through biomarkers. A
lithology change between 19.5 and 9.5 m shows the transition from marine pro delta towards
a more terrestrial environment with the deposition of a delta mouth bar. 9.5 to 2 m reflects a
predominantly terrestrial environment. Here the influence of delta lobe switching on the
depositional environment is clear with the St. Bernard, Lafouche and Plaquesmines-Modern
sub-deltas redirecting and redistributing water and sediment across the Mississippi Delta
landscape. Within the upper 2 m human influences such as damming the MRD are shown in
the environment, reducing sediment load and therefore terrestrial signals to the study site.
Two zones of optimal carbon storage have been identified, with the lithology, palynology, BIT
Index and FC32 1,15 inferring a wetland environment. Carbon storage potential is inferred
through total organic carbon and the n-alkane carbon preference indicator. The data supports
initial lithological interpretation of the MRD and highlights the need for the protection and
restoration these wetland environments with high carbon storage potential."

I argue that from a possible third perspective there are valuable insights available that in my opinion has been overlooked because mostly this perspective is categorized under the group of Deontology. I describe this group as Christian-Traditional. Although the association is reminiscent of a theological approach, I would like, on the contrary, to show three valuable insights from a philosophical approach that are a valuable addition to the debate. Firstly, I show the value of stating that uttering a lie also makes you a liar. Secondly, I argue that truthfulness and honesty are in practice more important moral categories than lying. And thirdly, I argue that in complex cases involving lying, such as the case of the Nazi at the door, there may be no right answers to the question of whether one should lie in such a situation. In themselves, I think they are three valuable insights, but these three elements together also show that categorizing the debate differently yields valuable insights that may have been overlooked because of the current categorization."

embodiment, affective production and perception, intertextuality,
and the boundaries of play, this research investigates the role of language use
in facilitating playful interaction and affect. TTRPG sessions are entertaining,
playful experiences aimed at collaborative narrative building through
the use of synthetic characters in a fictional world. Players speak as their
characters, acting out their desires, motivations, and actions. The goal of
TTRPG play is the collaborative construction of a narrative, and work in Discourse
Studies has established that emotional narratives are more compelling
and impactful than their non-emotional counterparts, generating identification
and involvement from audience members with story world characters.
TTRPG players, however, are in the unique position of both audience and
creator, since their response to story world stimuli has the capacity to influence
events in the narrative being constructed. Work in games scholarship
illustrates that in emotional story world circumstances of conflict, loss, resolution,
and levity, players employ affective cues to represent their characters’
emotions, even if it ’bleeds’ into a strong emotional response that has potential
negative repercussions for the player. This research attempts to address
the question of why players perform this affect, examining ten excerpts of
play from Critical Role, an actual play Dungeons & Dragons show, that
immediately follow or concern emotional story world circumstances and analyzing
them for affective cues, their appraisal and affirmation, navigation
across the game-reality boundary, and players’ capacity for creative language
use. Ultimately, this work aims to contribute to the broader question of why
we play narrative games and what we get out of them, through its analysis
of the role played by language in facilitating creative interaction."

The main point of this research is to answer the question of whether the underlying revenue model of the game Sky: Children of the Light comes at a cost to the “meaningful experience” of compassion represented by the text of the 
game, and how it does that. The research is performed through a textual analysis of in game elements such as the narrative, world design, character representation, interactivity, social mechanics, reward system and microtransactions. The findings show that while the game’s narrative, world design and social mechanics work in favor of guiding players towards cooperative actions and facilitate positive feelings of compassion, the underlying system of cosmetics-based rewards and slow progression tied to microtransactions overshadow the feelings of compassion in later stages of the game, instead conflating the meaning of compassionate actions with in-game currency and detaching them from any emotional involvement of the players."

The analysis showed that NVEs were regularly used to support communicative strategies, as well as moments of trust and intimacy, thus supporting the creation of interpersonal relationships. While the relevancy of nonverbal behavior on the creation of rapport could be observed overall and situation-specifically, due to the significant impact of context, multifunctionality, and individual behavior, generalizations concerning single NVEs could not be established."

These sex differences are known and accepted, but the underlying pathobiology of these differences are still largely unknown. The transcription factors KLF-4 and ER were found to play an important role in the disease development of atherosclerosis, so in this study ChIP-seq was performed to unravel the downstream genetic regulation of these transcription factors in plaque primary cells (PCs). This study points to KLF-4 as an important player in the disease progression of atherosclerosis by acting as a repressor. Furthermore, H3K4me2 modification were found associated with target genes involved in the same processes in both PCs and HASMCs and the smooth muscle cell marker genes MYH11 and KLF-4 are active in both cell lines but not in HEK293 cells pointing to a smooth muscle cell origin of PCs. Lastly, fourteen out of the nineteen pre-defined PC specific genes were found to be candidate target genes of either KLF-4 or H3K4me2 in PCs, validating the cultured cell line. These findings can be used in further research to validate the role of KLF-4 in the disease development of atherosclerosis and the role of the found candidate target genes could be further uncovered."
None of my business: Why corporations should assume responsibility for structural injustice and why they do not,"['Wernly, Mario']","['Sauer, Hanno']",2022-08-01T00:00:29Z,EN,['Business & Human Rights; Structural Injustice; corporate responsibility'],Applied Ethics,"Human rights violations are a common by-product of complex global economic structures. These violations should be understood as manifestations of structural injustice. Structural injustice occurs when societal processes construct structures that leave groups or individuals vulnerable to domination and deprivation. The traditional understanding of responsibility, which requires a causal link between an action or omission and a harm, is too narrow to assign responsibility for such circumstances. Therefore, a complementary account to assign responsibility for structural injustice is necessary. Iris Marion Young with her social connection model and various other authors try to provide such an account. While assigning responsibility to corporations that go beyond ensuring that they do not violate human rights themselves, these approaches are not demanding enough: they make it too easy for corporations to shed responsibility and facilitate strategies to deny responsibility. These shortcomings can be explained with reference to three reasons: the understanding that corporations’ primary role is to maximise private profits (ideology); the human inclination to put priority on closer relationships, on the immediate future, and on harms they directly cause in their normative reasoning (motivation); and indeterminacies about how ideal and just structures would look like, how to get there, and who should do what (collaboration)."
Routing electric cargo bikes: a hybrid solution approach,"['Hesselmans, Sam']","['Akker, Marjan van den']",2022-08-01T00:00:40Z,EN,['VRP;VRPLTT;Optimization algorithms;SA-ILP'],Computing Science,"Cities are getting more and more congested and environmental impact is becoming a larger point of interest for both customers and companies. Because of this more delivery companies are choosing to use cargo bikes instead of vans for the last-mile delivery of packages. This brings an interesting challenge as most vehicle routing problem solutions are created with vans in mind.
We study the vehicle routing problem for electric cargo bikes. Cargo bicycles differ from vans since they have less power and lower weight. Because of this, the difference in travel speed caused by the weight of the load and also by the slope of the road is significant for cargo bicycles, whereas this is negligible for vans. Hence, load-dependent travel times have to be taken into account when we want to find a good routing solution. Specifically, we consider the vehicle routing problem with load-dependent travel times for cargo bicycles (or VRPLTT) as proposed in an earlier paper by Fontaine. This problem is a variant of the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows using a single depot.
Our contribution is threefold. Firstly, we present a hybrid solution method based on combining column generation and local search. Such hybrid methods have previously been applied successfully on VRP models. We show that we can improve the solutions by applying this method. Secondly, we show how to introduce a constant wind in the VRPLTT model and present computational results showing different routing decisions are made when incorporating this wind. Lastly, in the original model, travel times are deterministic. This might not be a correct representation of the real world as travel times are not deterministic, especially in the city. Therefore, we show how to include stochastic travel times in our solution algorithm for VRPLTT and present computational results based on real-life instances."

Daarnaast wordt er gekeken naar een mogelijke modererende rol van sekse binnen dit verband. Dit onderzoek hoopt daarmee bij te dragen aan het verbreden van kennis en de doorontwikkeling van interventies. De broer/zus relatie wordt gedefinieerd aan de hand van warmte en conflict. In huidig onderzoek is er gebruik gemaakt van een reeds bestaande dataset met cross-sectionele data. De dataset bestaat uit 327 jongen en 396 meisjes (N= 723) in de leeftijd van 11 tot 14 jaar (M=12,6; SD= 0.7). Voor het beantwoorden van de onderzoeksvraag is er gebruik gemaakt van een hiërarchische multipele regressieanalyse. In huidig onderzoek wordt een significant verband gevonden tussen warmte en conflict en de sociale competentie van adolescenten. Daarnaast wordt sekse een significante moderator bevonden in de relatie tussen warmte en sociale competentie. Uit een aanvullende analyse komt naar voren dat warmte bij zowel meisjes als jongens een significante positieve invloed heeft op de sociale competentie. Dit verband is sterker voor jongens dan voor meisjes. Dit suggereert dat de aanwezigheid van warmte samenhangt met sociale competentie. Tot slot wordt er gevonden dat conflict een significante negatieve invloed heeft op sociale competentie bij meisjes. Bij jongens wordt dit verband niet gevonden. De aanwezigheid van conflict zal zeer waarschijnlijk leiden tot lager sociale competentie bij meisjes."
What works in Policing: Gender and Communication,"['Brug, Sanne van der']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-07-31T23:00:47Z,EN,[],Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems,"The author examined the relation between gender of the police officer and the communication between police officers. Possible mechanisms of gender in relation to communication were derived from the gender role theory and previous research. In addition, it was intended to include the moderator regarding the gender of the colleague during the communication. The sample existed of 98 police officers, from 5 different training locations in the Netherlands. The results of four logistic regressions showed that the effect of gender on the communication between police officers was not significant. There was no gender difference in verbal and nonverbal communication. The moderator, opposite or same-sex colleague, was not used in the analysis due to a lack of respondents regarding the female same-sex couples. Nonetheless, the control variable age was positively related with the variable nonverbal communication. This means that elder police officers communicate more nonverbally than younger officers. Given the limitations of this study, the findings suggest that additional research on the impact of gender on communication might be beneficial. Additionally, as this study didn't specifically address the impact of age on nonverbal communication, this topic can be a subject for further research as well. The goal of policy advice is to increase the existing knowledge of nonverbal communication by educating the younger police officers from the experience of the more senior officers. Policy interventions aimed at communicative diversity, with the condition that diverse communication is more effective, should take into account the most effective diversity policy, reinstating diversity managers."
A Detached Search for Connection: The Role of Affect and Contemporary Society in Millennial Women’s Fiction,"['Woude, Sara van der']","['Ferwerda, Susanne']",2022-08-01T00:00:39Z,EN,['millennial literature; affect theory; Rooney; Dolan; detachment; neoliberalism; dissociative feminism'],Literatuur vandaag,"This thesis investigates the role of detachment in fiction written by authors from the millennial generation (born 1981-1996). This is a highly relevant subject, as detachment from the self, others and society inhibits both personal wellbeing and societal progress. In order to gain insight into the state of attachment among the millennial generation, I have analysed interpersonal relationships in Naoise Dolan’s Exciting Times (2020) and Sally Rooney’s Beautiful World, Where Are You (2021), specifically by looking at the characters’ dialogue and inner monologue. I argue that in their portrayal of platonic and romantic relationships, the novels each present opposite views on the interaction between personal wellbeing and the political climate. Where Dolan’s novel depicts the stance that societal circumstances must first change in order to repair individual psychological health and engagement, Rooney’s novel presents the idea that small-scale connections can aid the restoration of both personal wellbeing and attachment to society and progress. The variation in these approaches affirms both the actuality of the debate on millennial detachment and the potential that fiction has to offer scenarios and solutions for the real world."
The big Avoidance Project: The relationship between Neuroticism and conditioned avoidance,"['Lepenioti, Georgia']","['Krypotos, Angelos']",2022-08-01T00:00:31Z,EN,[],Clinical Psychology,"Neuroticism trait is highly associated with mental disorders and psychopathology. Higher levels of neuroticism have been suggested to coexist with higher levels of avoidance and avoidance behaviors are considered to have a crucial role in anxiety-related disorders. Although neuroticism has been the most frequently studied personality trait in stress research, only a few studies have examined how it is related to the acquisition of conditioned avoidance. The aims of this study were two (1) to investigate the relationship between neuroticism trait and conditioned differential avoidance, (2) to investigate the relationship between neuroticism trait and differential relief rating. The experimental design of the study was based on experimental procedures used in the study of San Martin and her colleagues (2020) and consisted of 3 phases: 1) Pavlovian phase, 2) Instrumental phase, and 3) generalization phase. In a sample of 195 participants (N=195), two lamp colors (CS +) were associated with an aversive sound (US), while a third color was not (CS -). Next, participants could effectively avoid the US (CS + av), by clicking a button during the presentation of the CS +, but not during the presentation of the CS + unav. Avoidance generalization was investigated via button clicks during morphed colors between CS + av and CS + unav. During the experiment, participants completed relief rating, fear rating and US expectancy rating scales. Results did not reveal a significant relationship between neuroticism trait and differential avoidance (CS + av, CS -) and between neuroticism trait and differential relief rating. Taken together, individual differences in neuroticism did not play a significant role in avoidance frequency and in relief rating. However, the avoidance conditioning paradigm was successful, showing that participants successfully acquired the contingencies, learned what to fear and avoid, as well as generalized their fear and avoidance to similar stimuli."

The methodology of this study consisted of two major parts: a critical discourse analysis based upon Fairclough’s model (1995, 2010), and an online survey. The latter was used to find out what kind of disability language is more commonly used on Dutch medical and non-medical websites (N=6) in comparison to British medical and non-medical websites (N=6). In turn, the results showed that only instances of person-first language (PFL) were found on the Dutch websites, such as the frequently occurring phrase ‘mensen met autisme’ (people with autism). On the other hand, the British websites almost exclusively used identity-first language (IFL), like the phrase autistic people. These findings were then compared to the results from the survey. A total of 307 Dutch adults, of which 273 identified as (self-diagnosed) autistic, participated in the survey. The participants’ responses to quotes from the aforementioned Dutch websites (N=12) as well as their ratings of Dutch autism-related terms (N=10) were analyzed. In contrast to the websites, the majority of the participants preferred the use of identity-first over person-first terms, including ‘autistisch zijn’ (to be autistic) and ‘autist’ (autie). This means that there is a disconnect between the disability language preferred by members from the Dutch autism community and its use on Dutch medical and non-medical websites. However, in comparison to findings from (non-)native English-speaking autism communities (Bury et al., 2020; Kenny et al., 2015), the autistic terms that were most endorsed in the present research partially resembled those prior findings. In other words, the highest and second highest rated terms in this study, ‘autisme’ (autism) and ‘autistisch zijn’ (to be autistic), corresponded to the highest ranked terms in Kenny et al.’s (2015) and Bury et al.’s (2020) studies, respectively."

In order to create natural, circular, animal-friendly, and resilient aquaculture systems, aquaculturists must strive to understand these complex biogeochemical processes to replicate natural conditions and maintain resilience to disequilibrium. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur and the role of these elements in living organisms, whilst going into detail on the role of the North Sea seafloor microorganisms on the nitrogen cycle to improve their understanding and management in closed circular aquaculture systems farming North Sea biota. The paper also reviews the physical and ecological characteristics of the North Sea seafloor sediments, which consist of permeable sands, also referred to as ´biocatalytic filters` due to their ability to stimulate microbial activity by trapping dissolved and particulate organic matter from the water column. We subsequently highlight the reasons for the ecological importance of maintaining the biogeochemical cycles, especially the N cycle, in a healthy balance, and present the key concepts aquaculturists farming North Sea biota must take into account to maintain this balance. We conclude the review with a summary of the critical knowledge gaps which must be considered in future research on this topic to aid in the management and creation of more sustainable and self-supporting closed circular aquaculture systems."
Adopting Time-Aware Long-Short Term Memory for Psychosis Prognosis Prediction,"['Galanty, Maria']","['Schnack, Hugo']",2022-08-03T00:00:37Z,EN,"['Psychosis Prognosis Prediction,  PPP, Long-Short Term Memory, LSTM, Time-Aware Long-Short Term Memory, TLSTM']",Artificial Intelligence,"Schizophrenia is a complex and heterogeneous disorder because different underlying biological deficits may manifest the same symptoms across individuals. Therefore, the effective treatments can vary from one patient to another. Medicine helpful for one person, may not work or even worsen the condition of another. Individualized and accurate prediction of long-term disease course and therapy response may help navigate treatment decisions. Thus machine learning methods might be useful in treatment outcome prediction. Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) variant capable of handling long-term event dependencies, which are common in medical data. However, it does require regular time intervals between events. In contrast to standard LSTM, Time-Aware LSTM (T-LSTM) can handle and incorporate information about irregular time intervals in data via a time decay function. 

The goal of this study was to compare the performance of LSTM and T-LSTM models for the psychosis prognosis prediction (PPP) task, which tries to predict if a patient will be in a remission state. OPTiMiSE dataset, which comes from a clinical study investigating whether switching antipsychotics improves outcomes in first-episode schizophrenia patients, was used in this research. First, we checked if there was any performance difference between LSTM and T-LSTM models. Second, we investigated the effect of adjusting the T-LSTM decay function shape by learning its parameters through the backpropagation procedure. Parametric sigmoid with one and two trainable variables was used as a time decay function.

We managed to improve and obtain more stable results, while adjusting the decay function shape to the PPP application. The area under the curve (AUC) score increased from 0.65 for LSTM and T-LSTM models to 0.69 for the T-LSTM model with one trainable variable parametric sigmoid."
The influence of parent perceived stress on the relation between co-regulation strategies and infant emotion regulation skills,"['Haas, Emma de']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-08-03T00:00:44Z,EN,"['Emotion Regulation, Co-regulation, Stress, Infants, Parents']",Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"A positive parent-child relationship plays a key role in early emotion development. Part of the parent-child relationship is the process of co-regulation, which is an essential for infant emotion regulation development. Existing research indicates that parents’ stress has a negative influence on co-regulation and therefore is suggested to have a negative influence on the early development of emotion regulation as well. In this study, it is examined if there is an association between co-regulation strategies and infant emotion regulation and if this relation is moderated by the level of parent perceived stress. A sample of 225 infants and their parents was studied. Parent report questionnaires were used to examine parent perceived stress, infant emotion regulation and co-regulation. Six co-regulation strategies were analysed separately. Ignoring the child is negatively correlated with emotion regulation skills. This can be explained by age dependent effects of co-regulation strategies. Expressing the emotions of the child is positively correlated with emotion regulation skills, which is in line with existing literature and the concept of mind-mindedness. Parent perceived stress moderates the relation between using calm voice and emotion regulation skills as well as the relation between distracting and emotion regulation skills. Recommendations for clinical practice are to teach parents to perform less ignoring and more articulation of emotions for two-year old children. Future research must include more lower educated parents and more fathers. Also, longitudinal design is recommended to further study the age specific effects of active versus passive co-regulation strategies."
Psy-Flex: Assessing Psychological Flexibility in a Clinical Sample,"['Manferrari, Jakob']","['Schok, Michaela']",2022-08-03T00:00:39Z,EN,['Psychological Flexibilit; Psy-Flex; Clinical Assessment; Clinical population; PTSD; Depression'],Clinical Psychology,"The psychological flexibility model provides a transdiagnostic framework where disorders can be treated differently from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. There is growing evidence in support of psychological flexibility being an important factor for wellbeing and linking its shortage with psychopathology. The Psy-Flex is a self-measure questionnaire of six items that aims to assess all the six components of psychological flexibility.
This research has three different aims. The first aim is to investigate if the Psy-Flex can discriminate between a clinical and a non-clinical sample. The second purpose is to investigate whether the Psy-Flex can differentiate between PTSD and depression samples. The third aim is to compare the Pys-Flex with PTSD checklist for DSM5 (PCL-5) and the State-trait Anxiety Index (STAI-6) to validate its construct validity.
To do so, a questionnaire composed by the Psy-Flex, four items of PCL-5 and five items of STAI-6 was developed. The survey was then distributed to a pool of university students and to specific social media groups.
The result shows that the Psy-Flex yields significant different scores between individuals from a clinical sample and a non-clinical sample, but it fails to distinguish PTSD from depression, making it a useful screening tool but an unreliable tool for differential diagnosis. The results are further supportive of the construct validity of the Psy-Flex when compared to the PCL-5 and STAI-6.
Future research should focus on developing cut-off scores of the Psy-Flex to be used in the discrimination process between clinical and non-clinical cases."

Their heterosexual colleagues do not share the same experience but are crucial for diversity and inclusion (D&I) efforts. The support for D&I efforts depends on the self-interest of all stakeholders and heterosexual employees have the most influence. Perspective-taking is associated with increased empathy and helping behaviour. We examined how inclusive, heteronormative, and exclusive organisational climates affect heterosexual employees’ support for D&I policies and LGB inclusion. By exposing heterosexuals to an exclusive organisational climate, enabled them to take a perspective which is novel to them but not to LGB employees. We expected that being suppressed in their free sexual expression could harm their self-interest and perspective taking increases their empathy thereby leading to an increased support for D&I efforts. Research on the impact of harming heterosexual’s self-interest, by suppressing their expression of sexual orientation, on their support for D&I efforts is limited. Participants were exposed to either an inclusive, heteronormative, or exclusive organisational climate and their positivity towards the working climate, their support for D&I policies and LGB inclusion, and their perceived importance of these efforts were assessed. Participants felt significantly less positive in the heteronormative and exclusive climate than in the inclusive climate. However, besides their aversion to exclusive climates no difference in the support for D&I efforts could be observed. The findings indicate that heterosexual employees are as averse to heteronormative climates as they are to fully exclusive climates."

Research shows that dating apps may foster the relationship development process, but also hinder this process. Additionally, there is much disagreement about the degree of self-disclosure – an important aspect involved in relationship formation – in online and offline dating settings. It was hypothesized that self- disclosure has a positive effect on the relationship development process and that the degree of self-disclosure is higher in online dating settings. Besides, the online dating setting was expected to slow down the relationship development process. Taken together, it was hypothesized that self-disclosure mediates the effect of dating setting on the relationship development process. A cross-sectional study (N = 144) has been conducted among 18- to 29- year-olds who were involved in a relationship at time of participation. Contrary to predictions, regression analysis showed that self-disclosure causes a slower relationship development process. Independent samples t-test showed no significant difference in the relationship development process, nor the extent of self-disclosure between the two dating settings. Self- disclosure thus does not mediate the effect of dating setting on the relationship development process. Further research is needed to further explore the effect of self-disclosure on the relationship development process, incorporating relationship duration and type of dating app. In addition, it may be valuable to create an up-to-date scale for measuring the relationship development process."

Hidden in plain sight – Extracellular vesicles in saliva and sputum as biomarkers of lung cancer,"['Bruin, Glenn de']","['Wauben, Marca']",2022-08-05T00:00:46Z,EN,[],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Lung cancer causes the most deaths of any cancer worldwide. An important reason for this is the fact that the disease is often diagnosed too late. Easier methods for the early detection of lung cancer would therefore greatly contribute to the overall survival chance. Saliva and sputum are easily collectible bodily fluids that contain many biological molecules. Among these molecules may be profiles that are unique to lung cancer. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived vesicles secreted to transport cargo between cells. These vesicles are released by all known cell types and come in many shapes and sizes, with the subcategories of EVs mainly being separated by size and the biological route through which the vesicles were generated. EVs are found in all bodily fluids, including the saliva and sputum, and are thought to be a reflection of the state and the origin in which the cell that released them is currently in. EVs are known to carry a wide range of cargoes, namely a mix of selected lipids, proteins and even genetic information. As EVs arrive to other cells they are taken up, thereby inducing phenotypic changes in the recipient cells. Since multiple studies have described specific functions of EVs in the context of lung cancer and that certain molecules may be enriched specifically on those EVs that are derived from lung cancer cells, EVs may carry potentially useful biomarkers. Considering that EVs are retrieved from all bodily fluids, and that lung-derived vesicles are more abundant in sputum and saliva, there may be valuable information in these vesicles that can aid in the diagnosis of lung cancer. In this review, we investigate what sets lung cancer-derived EVs apart from healthy EVs and how these differences may be exploited in the future in a clinical setting. To this extent we collected and set out the most recently available literature on salivary or sputum-derived lung cancer EVs together with more established findings on the role of EVs in lung cancer and currently known lung-cancer biomarkers, and we discuss the future clinical implications of the information at hand."
Additional value of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy for epilepsy diagnostics in the normal appearing epileptogenic zone,"['Gutiérrez Santamaría, Sofía']","['Vincken, Koen']",2022-08-05T00:00:39Z,EN,[],Medical Imaging,"Epilepsy affects 50 million people worldwide approximately, thus it is considered one of the most common neurological diseases. For this reason, a reliable diagnosis is of paramount importance. Neuroimaging plays an essential role in the evaluation. Although CT scans are typically the first modality used to detect the underlying cause of an epileptic seizure, they are likely to miss the majority of the epileptogenic lesions. Therefore, other imaging modalities are used to detect the cause of epilepsy. MRI is generally performed; however, it only identifies structural pathology in the epileptic brain in one third of the epileptic patients. For that reason, MRS is a promising tool in the detection of the normal appearing epileptogenic zone. This modality detects abnormalities that are invisible to a conventional MRI because metabolic abnormalities often precede structural changes.

TLE is the most common form of focal epilepsy in which about 20% of patients have negative structural MR images. The majority of the reviewed studies confirm that NAA, Cr and Cho are the most commonly used metabolites to identify the epileptogenic zone in MRI negative TLE and ETLE. Moreover, NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho and NAA/(Cr+Cho) are the most widely accepted ratios for lateralization of the normal appearing epileptogenic zone. Furthermore, NAA and MI have been reported as the metabolites that best enable the study of seizure spread."

Data from the Dutch Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) study collected in 2017 were used. The sample included 7392 adolescents aged between 11 and 18 years old (M = 14.16, SD = 1.66).
In line with expectations, a simple linear regression showed a main effect for gaming. A higher score on gaming predicted a higher BMI. Social media use did not play a role. Furthermore, a higher score on physical activity predicts a lower BMI, but healthy diet did not play a role. Contrary to expectations, a healthy diet and physical activity showed no buffering effect on the link between screen time and BMI. Thus, gaming is positively connected to BMI, and physical activity is negatively related to BMI, but physical activity cannot counteract the negative influence of gaming on gaining weight."

However, the results showed that poor parental monitoring and low self-control were significant predictors of delinquent behaviour, which suggests that delinquent behaviour among adolescents could be prevented or reduced by the degree of parental monitoring and self-control."

Empowerment is geen significante voorspeller voor het drinkniveau op T2. Dit impliceert dat alcoholgebruik door minderjarigen meer wordt beïnvloed door omgevingsinvloeden dan door individuele factoren, wat informatief is voor toekomstige interventies."
Depressive symptoms and Problematic Cannabis use among Adolescents: Gender Differences and the Mediation Effect of Self-Medication,"['Splunder, isis van']","['Peeters, Margot']",2022-08-05T00:00:45Z,EN,"['Depressive symptoms, experimental cannabis use, problematic cannabis use, coping strategy, emotion regulation, self-medication, adolescents.']",Youth Studies,"Aim: This study investigated the longitudinal relationship between depressive symptoms and experimental and problematic cannabis use. In addition, the effects of gender and self-medication on this relationship were assessed. Method: A three-wave longitudinal sample of adolescents aged 12 to 19 years (N = 1673, 43,8 % boys) was selected from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). Results: In the larger group, depressive symptoms did not predict (problematic) cannabis use. However, results revealed that among experimental users depressive symptoms were higher compared to non-users. In addition, the interaction showed that the relationship between depressive symptoms and experimental cannabis use was stronger among boys. Regarding gender differences, girls scored significantly higher on depressive symptoms compared to boys, and boys scored significantly higher on problematic cannabis use compared to girls. Self-medication did not explain the relationship between depressive symptoms and cannabis use. However, self-medication showed a positive relationship with (problematic) cannabis use. Conclusion: Findings suggest that problematic use is not associated with depressive symptoms, though depressive symptoms are higher among male experimental users. Male adolescents dealing with depressive symptoms are thus a vulnerable group when it comes to the development of problematic cannabis use."
The Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Feelings of Loneliness Among Extraverted and Introverted Adolescents in the Netherlands,"['Broijl, Djura']","['Heu, L.C.']",2022-08-05T00:00:44Z,EN,['adolescents;loneliness;extraversion;COVID-19;well-being;lockdown;distancing measures;mental health'],Youth Studies,"The spread of the COVID-19 virus has led to lockdowns and distancing measures, which resulted in drastic changes in social interaction of adolescents. This research is aimed at studying how the lack of social contacts during the pandemic may have influenced feelings of loneliness among Dutch adolescents, with a special focus on extraverts and introverts. Data from the longitudinal ‘YOUth Got Talent’-project was analyzed in this study. The sample contained 1471 male (41.3%) and female (55.7%) adolescents, aged 16 to 25 (Mage=17.85,.SD=1.95), from different MBO-schools in Utrecht. As predicted, feelings of loneliness increased over time. Also, significant results were found between W1 and W3 (p <.001), W1 and W2 (p <.010), meaning that there were more feelings of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, than before, in 2019. These findings support the relation between increased feelings of loneliness, and distancing measures regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. However, no support was found that extraverted adolescents experienced more loneliness in response to the lockdowns than introverted adolescents. Because this study focused on loneliness and extraversion during the pandemic, further research is needed to clarify the relationship between extraversion and social isolation, since there may be a difference."

Data from the Conflict and Management of Relationships (CONAMORE) study collected between 2001 and 2005 were used. The sample included 921 adolescents between 13 and 18 years old. Adolescents’ music preferences, measured in wave 3, were subsumed under the general labels of Rock, Pop, Urban, Elite and Dance. Identity formation was measured in wave 5 in two dimensions: commitment and reconsideration. The results showed that contrary to expectations, Rock fans did not score lower on commitment, and even scored lower on reconsideration. Another notable finding was that Pop fans showed positive outcomes on all variables, that is more commitment and less reconsideration. No gender interactions were found. Thus, results suggest that adolescents who prefer Pop, and to a lesser extent Rock, music show positive outcomes in their identity formation, and that this holds for both boys and girls."

Zur Beantwortung der Forschungsfrage ist zuerst eine Literaturstudie durchgeführt worden, in der beide didaktischen Herangehensweisen definiert wurden und demzufolge Arbeitsdefinitionen und Prinzipien abgeleitet werden konnten. Die Prinzipien der beiden Konzepte dienten als Grundlage für die Entwicklung von Unterrichtsmaterialien, am Beispiel der deutschen Einheit, in denen Multiperspektivität und kulturelles Lernen als didaktische Herangehensweisen zusammengebracht wurden. Diese Verbindung wurde mithilfe von authentischen Materialien, in denen unterschiedliche Perspektiven der deutschen Einheit präsentiert wurden, gestaltet.

Zur Prüfung der Anwesenheit der Verbindung von Multiperspektivität und kulturellem Lernen in den Unterrichtsmaterialien hat eine Fokusgruppe von drei Deutschlehrer*innen und drei Geschichtslehrer*innen die Materialien kommentiert. Mit der Methode des lauten Denkens wurde untersucht, welche Prinzipien die Lehrenden, ohne Vorkenntnisse über die integrierten Konzepte, in den Materialien erkannt haben. Dieses Vorgehen hat gezeigt, dass alle Prinzipien von allen Lehrenden mindestens einmal in den Unterrichtsmaterialien erkannt wurden. Die Einschätzung der Lehrenden stimmte häufig mit der angestrebten Einteilung der Prinzipien in der Handreichung überein. Damit kann festgestellt werden, dass die Materialien eine Verbindung der beiden Konzepte ermöglicht haben. Die Konzepte der Multiperspektivität und des kulturellen Lernens zeigen viele Verbindungen auf und können daher zum fachübergreifenden Unterricht für Deutsch und Geschichte einen Beitrag leisten. Die Prinzipien beider Konzepte sind nicht nur im theoretischen Bereich zu vereinen, sondern können auch in der Praxis verbunden werden und die Lernenden sprachlich und historisch bilden. 

Diese Masterarbeit hat gezeigt, dass beide Konzepte einander ergänzen. Die Verbindung der Prinzipien der Multiperspektivität und des kulturellen Lernens trägt dazu bei, dass die deutsche Kultur und die Deutschen, im Rahmen des Deutschunterrichts, betont werden können. Lernende bekommen einen Einblick in den Zusammenhang der deutschen Gesellschaft im Laufe der deutschen Einheit und der Zeit darauffolgend. Die Verbindung beider Konzepte liefert für den Geschichtsunterricht konkret einen länderspezifischen Schwerpunkt. Der (historische) Kontext einer bestimmten Gesellschaft wird erweitert.

Zum Einsatz in der Praxis ist eine Handreichung zu empfehlen, in der kurz erläutert wird, wie die Multiperspektivität und das kulturelle Lernen verbunden werden können."
Chronic Itch Relief Through Affective Touch in Romantic Couples,"['Dragomir, Antonia']","['Schielen, Zoë']",2022-08-09T00:01:27Z,EN,"['chronic itch, affective touch, C fibres, treatment, romantic partner']",Neuropsychology,"Chronic itch is a common condition in dermatological diseases that severely impacts the patients’ quality of life. The majority of them also suffer from psychiatric disorders. It is a heavy burden especially for those that are not responsive to anti-histamine medication. Therefore, there is an urgent need for treatment to be developed for these itch patients. Recent research has uncovered a promising technique for reducing itch: affective touch. Affective touch represents a slow velocity (3 cm/s), gentle touch, which was found to alleviate electrically induced itch. Both itch and affective touch are mediated by unmyelinated nerve fibres in the hairy skin of humans, called C fibres, and they also share common brain activation areas. As this affectionate caress is most often present in romantic relationships, we hypothesise that itch will be even more inhibited when affective touch is applied by one’s partner. In this study, we collected data from six couples. The participants were subjected to six minutes of electrical itch, with simultaneous affective and then non-affective touch, applied by their partner and the experimenter, respectively. A non-parametric ANOVA for a within-subjects design was conducted. The results of the study did not show any significant difference between conditions. Importantly, the low power of the experiment cannot lead to conclusive evidence. However, the trend of the results does seem to be in line with our expectations. In conclusion, future research is recommended to use larger samples to investigate whether the effect of the romantic partner’s touch can be confirmed."

Modelling and quantifying runoff and soil loss for a degraded and restored Jordan side wadi,"['Gotink, Emily']","['Jong, Steven de']",2022-08-10T00:01:03Z,EN,['Drylands;Land degradation;Jordan side wadis;RHEM;Surface runoff;Water erosion;Water harvesting;Watershed rehabilitation'],Earth Surface and Water,"Water erosion is the most widespread land degrading process worldwide. Especially in drylands, this
process is intensified by anthropogenic pressure on soil productivity, resulting in a self-reinforcing
effect of topsoil removal, declining vegetation and increased runoff generation. This process is also
ongoing in Jordan, where recurring droughts, years of overgrazing and mismanagement of agricultural land has led to removal of native vegetation and consequential land degradation through water
erosion. Steep slopes of the side wadis that border the Jordan Valley exacerbate these problems,
causing flash floods and clogging of water collection ponds. A SIDA-FAO-funded project of The
International Centre for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA) arose to test rehabilitation
implementation on small scale and thereby increase local stakeholders’ preparedness for uptake
and out-scaling. Therefore, this research aimed to study and quantify surface runoff and soil loss
in a Jordan side wadi during its degraded state and after modelled implementation of restoration
measures. Simultaneously, erosion hotspots and restoration potential were identified for targeted
erosion control. A hydrological pre-assessment was performed for model validation, using the curve
number approach, runoff ratios and erosion feature field analyses. An erodibility map was created
in GIS based on literature, datasets and field validation. Representative hotspots were selected for
additional fieldwork to collect input for the Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM). This
process-based hillslope model was chosen for runoff and soil loss quantification as it has proven to be
successful for the Jordan rangelands. It requires rainfall data, soil texture, slope- and cover characteristics. The CLimate GENeration model (CLIGEN) was bias corrected with a local rainfall data,
resulting in a 300-year simulation of rainfall statistics. Soil texture and cover characteristics were
collected through fieldwork at the hotspot classes and a stream network assessment was performed
to obtain representative slope-length combinations, which were used to upscale from hillslope- to
wadi level. The degraded scenarios yielded a runoff ratio of 10,7%, which was in agreement with the
hydrological pre-assessment. Soil loss was estimated to be 2,31 ton/ha/y, with maximum hotspots
of 4,99 ton/ha/y. This was lower than expected, which could likely be attributed to high rock content at the fieldwork sites. Restored equilibrium scenarios yielded an average reduction of 21,8%
in runoff and 53,4% in soil loss for the entire wadi, emphasizing the impact of increased vegetation
cover on the ecosystem’s resilience. Direct impact of intended WH structures was assessed by a
script based on pit dimensions, infiltration rate and trapping efficiency. Runoff process description
of the script lacked detail, underestimating runoff capturing capacity and overestimating sediment
buffer capacity, yet providing a rough tool for determining optimal pit dimensions and spacing.
This yielded an average decrease of 35% in runoff and 71% in soil loss for the restorable scenarios."
The Mediating Role of Self-Esteem in the Relationship between Romantic Attachment and Quality of Life in Late Adolescence.,"['Caissotti di Chiusano, Margherita']","['Gericke, Renate']",2022-08-10T00:01:09Z,EN,[],Clinical Psychology,"Abstract
The way we attach to others romantically highly influences our possibilities of forming healthy, satisfying relationships. This study explores the mediative role of self-esteem in the relationship between romantic attachment and quality of life in late adolescence. Specifically, it was expected that higher levels of avoidant and anxious attachment would predict lower global self-esteem, in turn predicting a lower quality of life. Moreover, differences between Italian, Dutch, and German participants in such relationships were analyzed. To do so, the Revised Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR-R), the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, the Quality-of-Life Scale (QOL) questionnaire, were administered on a sample of 136 European adolescents, ranging from age 18 to 24. Results showed that, in avoidantly attached participants, self-esteem fully mediated the relationship between attachment and quality of life. For anxiously attachment participants, a partial mediation effect of self-esteem was found. However, when observing Italian, Dutch, and German participants separately, no mediation effect was found."

disadvantages of using a certain set up and how best to calibrate it is important for
researchers choosing a setup for their study. When using an eye tracking setup without
screens a lot of relevant questions remain unanswered regarding how to calibrate and use
the setup. To answer those questions, a screenless remote eye tracking setup with custom
built offline calibration software was used to record the gaze of both eyes of participants
while they looked at several calibration and validation points. This gaze data was used to
determine the way to calibrate this setup that results in as accurate and precise data as
possible and investigate the effect of binocular and monocular data on the accuracy of the
results to determine which is better. The constancy and predictability of the parallax error
was also studied. The results show that the use of binocular or monocular accuracy led to an
improvement in the accuracy of the data, but it cannot be concluded that this difference is
significant. Using more calibration points does significantly improve the quality of the data
when comparing a 4-point calibration to a 9-point calibration. However, the improvement is
so small that in most interaction studies the improvement is not worth the extra time a 9-point
calibration takes. The results concerning the distance between calibration points show no
difference in data quality when using calibration points placed further apart. The parallax
error seems constant enough to manually correct for it with some experience and knowledge
about the forward shift of the object from the calibration plane and the location of the stimulus
relative to the centre of the screen. It is recommended to test one’s setup extensively before
using it in an experiment to determine the best way to calibrate it and use the data and to
gain insight into how big of a parallax error one can expect."
Increasing Algorithm Appreciation in AI-based Decision Support Systems through Encouraging Theory of Machine,"['Olejnikov, Katharina']","['Liefooghe, Baptist']",2022-08-10T00:01:11Z,EN,['artificial intelligence; algorithm appreciation; algorithm aversion; trust;\ntheory of machine; decision making'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","While the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for decision-making is widespread, the technology cannot be fully realized when the end-user mistrusts it. To increase algorithm appreciation, literature supports the idea of clarifying how AI works. Rather than presenting AI as a black box, the framework Theory of Machine proposes an approach to explain artificial intelligence to end-users by contrasting it to human thinking. The present research examines the effects of Theory of Machine priming on algorithm appreciation. One hundred twenty-eight participants were randomly assigned to a priming condition where artificial intelligence was introduced as
in Theory of Machine or as a black box. Namely, comparing human to algorithmic judgment or by only giving technical descriptions of AI’s reasoning, respectively. Afterwards, participants performed an age guessing game where an algorithm aided as a decision support system. The extent to which participants aligned their answers to the algorithm’s advice was used as a measurement for algorithm appreciation (weight of advice). Additionally, task difficulty was manipulated to explore possible moderation effects. Based on previous
literature it was hypothesized that a Theory of Machine framing will increase algorithm appreciation compared to the Black Box framing. The hypothesis was not confirmed. The results showed no significant difference between the means of the weight on advice score on the framing conditions or task difficulty. We conclude that a Theory of Machine framing does not influence algorithm appreciation. Several explanations for this effect, limitations of the study, and suggestions for further research on how to increase trust in AI are considered."

In total, 94 participants between 18 and 35 years completed an online questionnaire consisting of the relevant study variables. Bivariate correlation analyses revealed that both lower sense of societal community and greater ethno-cultural identity conflict were significantly correlated with both decreased life satisfaction and more psychological symptoms. Greater ethno-cultural identity conflict and lower sense of societal community were significantly correlated with lower self-esteem. Lower self-esteem was significantly correlated with lower life satisfaction and more psychological symptoms. Mediation analyses revealed that these associations were partly mediated by self-esteem. The findings highlight the promotion of the internalization of two cultures, social support, and community belonging among LGBTQ+ identifying individuals with migration background to protect their mental health and enhance life satisfaction.

Worsening renal function and all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure: an update of the literature,"['Kamarioti, Maria']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-08-10T00:00:48Z,EN,"['worsening renal function, heart failure, prognosis, all-cause mortality']",Epidemiology,"Background: Despite the numerous evidence-based treatments for heart failure (HF), its prognosis has only shown moderate improvements in the past decades. Worsening renal function (WRF) is common among patients with HF, however, its impact on prognosis remains controversial. Some studies have shown that WRF is associated with unfavorable outcomes in HF populations including increased short- and long-term mortality. Conversely, others did not reveal a specific prognostic value of WRF suggesting that it is probably not related to increased mortality in some HF patients.

Objective: The objective of this review is to give an update of the literature from 2012 onwards on the relationship between WRF and mortality in patients with all types of HF to further clarify the prognostic significance of WRF on HF, which has not been established yet.

Method: We performed a literature search of the PubMed database for studies that investigated the relationship between WRF and mortality in HF patients. The literature search was limited to studies conducted between 2012 to 2022. Our primary focus was on studies that examined the association between WRF and mortality in HF patients (≥ 18 years old) with a confirmed diagnosis of HF in either the ‘acute or ‘chronic’ phase of the disease. Regarding WRF, we included only studies with a precise description of the WRF definition. The primary outcome measure was defined as all-cause mortality.

Results: Twelve studies were identified, six of which revealed WRF to be an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. However, there was inconsistency across the studies in terms of the definition of WRF, the timing of WRF occurrence, the type of HF patients, and the studied risk factors.

Conclusions: Taken together, there is still controversy regarding the prognostic impact of WRF on HF, and there is no gold standard to assess “true WRF.” Therefore, future studies are required to investigate the relationship between WRF and HF by using a more consistent definition in terms of the timing of WRF occurrence, as well as by including more homogeneous populations with respect to the risk factors."

The aim of the current study was to investigate which clinical phenotypes might be helpful in the diagnostic process to better differentiate between bvFTD and PPD patients. The study sample consisted of 268 patients, seen on the screening day of the Social Brain Project at the VUmc Amsterdam. In this cross-sectional study, 103 bvFTD patients were compared with 64 PPD patients on their baseline scores on several questionnaires, cognitive screeners and neuropsychological assessment. These were used to measure behaviour, neurocognition, social cognition and mental impact. Regarding behavioural questionnaires, PPD patients were more affected on the MADRS, measuring depressive symptoms. Within neurocognition, bvFTD patients were more affected on cognitive screeners, global cognition and language. Regarding social cognition, bvFTD patients were more affected on the Ekman 60 faces test, measuring emotion recognition. In conclusion, this study suggests that bvFTD patients might be differentiated from PPD patients by depressive symptoms, overall cognitive functioning, language and basic social cognitive functioning. These findings contribute to the literature and the clinical diagnostic process of differentiating between bvFTD and PPD patients."

Elevated levels of touch deprivation are found to be related to an altered evaluation of touch. This is particularly interesting concerning touch with an affective component, frequently described as CT-optimal touch. In current research, the relation between touch deprivation and the pleasantness perception of three different touch conditions (i.e. slow, fast and static touch) is examined. Furthermore, we examined whether the pleasantness perception of touch of the receiver is different from the toucher. The expectation was that the pleasantness perception of slow and fast touch was related to touch deprivation. In addition, we expected that being the receiver of slow touch entails a higher pleasantness perception than being the toucher. The present study was conducted during two science festivals and 102 individuals participated. In line with our expectation, the pleasantness perception of slow touch was related to touch deprivation. However, in contrast to our expectation, the pleasantness perception of fast touch was not related to touch deprivation. In neither of the touch conditions, the relation between pleasantness perception of touch and touch deprivation was modulated by the participant's role (either receiver or toucher). Therefore, the relation between pleasantness perception of touch and touch deprivation is dependent upon the type of touch and either being receiver or toucher holds no difference regarding pleasantness perception of touch. Current research possibly indicates that during times of restrictions of touch, an altered evaluation of touch is related to touch deprivation and reflected into higher levels of pleasantness perception of slow touch."

The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between loneliness in lockdown and psychological flexibility (PF) in a student population (H1) and to see if this relationship is mediated by activity adaptability (H2). 
An online questionnaire was created to collect self-reported data. The sample consisted of N = 90 students. A linear regression was performed to test H1 and a mediation analysis in PROCESS was performed to test H2. 
Results. Results revealed that PF was negatively related to feelings of loneliness in lockdown. Furthermore, results showed that this effect was not mediated by activity adaptability. 
The current study provides evidence for the negative relationship between PF and loneliness in lockdown among students. Knowledge on factors that influence loneliness in lockdown is needed, as it can be used to create future interventions that aim to tackle loneliness in lockdown. The current results provide support for Acceptance and Commitment based interventions that promote PF. For future research it is recommended to investigate the causal relationship between PF and loneliness."
Pre-training on vocabulary and its effects on educational television programs as medium for literacy education,"['Nijstad, Mike']","['Kester, L.']",2022-08-17T00:00:57Z,EN,['Literacy; text comprehension; vocabulary; pre-training interventions; educational television programs'],Educational Sciences,"A growing proportion of people leaving school are low-literate. Concurrently, children have an increasing access to watching video content, including educational television programs. Research has shown that exposure to educational television programs among primary school children had positive effects on learning in terms of text comprehension. The given development of the access to and use of video content, argues for reconsideration of this earlier findings.
To properly make advantage of educational television programs to improve literacy, additional measures to lower the cognitive load of this programs is necessary. In this study, focus is on pre-training as such a measure. The research question of this study is: Does pre-training on vocabulary enhance the positive effects of educational television programs on text comprehension? To formulate an answer to this question, a pre- and post-test design with three groups was used. The difference in test scores was interpreted as the learning effect and thus the dependent variable. Due to insignificant results, no generalizable conclusions could be drawn from this research. However, the scores on the post-test are higher than the pre-test scores. Therefore, the results encourage further research into the effects of the combination of pre-training and educational television programs on text comprehension."

With regards to the microbiome, we show that bacteriophages are numerous in the body and can both protect or disturb the status quo, protecting against foreign invaders but also containing the ability to transform bacteria into more toxic variants. When entering the blood circulation, bacteriophages encounter a variety of factors influencing their longevity, ranging from complement and innate immune cells to antibodies produced by the humoral immune response.

This thesis aims to achieve a description of behavior, like chained decisions, that better resembles everyday functioning. With this purpose in mind, we investigated the differences in the distribution of reaction time of single and double decisions and their relation to WM. This was done by using a clinical task that measured the span of WM and by using reaction time tasks that consisted of color and contrast judgment tasks. Three levels were used in the reaction time tasks, single decisions, double independent decisions, and double dependent decisions. These tasks were used to get the drift rate, boundary separation, and non-decision time of reaction times of the EZ-diffusion model. There was an effect on all three parameters on single decision tasks compared to the double decision tasks. However, no effect was found between the double independent decisions and the double dependent decisions.
Also, the link between the cost of making a double decision and the span of WM was nonsignificant although in the expected direction. Follow-up research is recommended to test these effects with a higher statistical power."
How high should the Minimum Tax be?,"['Jong, Harmen de']","['Kommer, Victor van']",2022-08-17T00:00:47Z,EN,['corporate income tax ; OECD ; minimum tax ; kanbur-keen model ; tax haven; profit shifting; GloBE ; Pillar Two'],Economic Policy,"In 2016, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) created the Inclusive Framework on BEPS. This multilateral organization seeks to create and implement policy responses to economic developments that rendered existing global tax agreements outdated. The Inclusive Framework published blueprints for a global plan to combat profit shifting in 2020. This notably includes a global minimum corporate income tax rate.If it is too low, it hardly reduces incentive for MNEs to shift their profits and the main difference it makes is that tax havens can increase their tax rates without fear of competition from other havens with even lower rates. Setting the tax rate for this minimum tax comes with a complicated trade-off. If it is too low, almost all of the revenue gains accrue in tax havens and non-havens face the economic effects caused by their firms facing higher costs without getting much in return. If it is too high, it will reduce profit shifting to such a large extent that the minimum tax will cost tax havens much more than they gain from it. At that point, they are incentivized to undermine the system. I calculate how tax revenues per jurisdiction change as a consequence of the introduction of a minimum corporate income tax rate, using data on profit shifting from Tørsløv et al. (2018) and mathematical modelling of the relationship between tax rates and profit shifting based on the Kanbur-Keen model (Kanbur and Keen 1993; Keen and Konrad 2013). Using this output I recommend an optimal minimum rate for various metrics of optimality.  I find that 15%, the rate currently chosen in the proposals, is the most recommendable tax rate."

Ocean Dynamic Sea Level Projections During the 21st Century Along the Dutch Coast,"['Jesse, Franka']","['Drijfhout, S.S.']",2022-09-09T00:01:39Z,EN,['sea level; sea level rise; regional sea level; dynamic sea level; CMIP; CMIP5; CMIP6; Dutch coast; North Sea; AR6; AMOC; linear regression; Monte Carlo sampling; mixed layer depth'],Climate Physics,"One of the major contributors to sea level rise along the Dutch coast during the 21st century is Ocean Dynamic Sea Level (ODSL). ODSL is defined as the sea level anomaly due to ocean currents, wind stresses and local thermosteric and halosteric effects. Along the Dutch coast, climate models project an ODSL rise between 0 - 35 cm at the end of the century, depending on the emission scenario. Hence, this accounts for a large part of the total projected sea level rise of 30 - 120 cm along the Dutch coast. It is important that climate models are able to model ODSL correctly. However, the current state-of-the-art climate models from CMIP5 and CMIP6 show a large spread in ODSL projections and ODSL rise at the Dutch coast increased significantly between CMIP5 and CMIP6. One hypothesis for the latter is the larger increase in global mean temperature in CMIP6. This increase is larger than the assessed ranges provided in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In this study, we aim to improve the quality of ODSL projections from CMIP5 and CMIP6 by better understanding the processes that influence ODSL change along the Dutch coast. First, we use linear regression models to identify the reason for a model’s ODSL change. The processes we consider as explanatory variables for ODSL change are global surface air temperature (GSAT), global mean thermosteric sea level (GMTSL), and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength. Using only GSAT as a predictor variable works for the CMIP5 ensemble but does not explain all long-term changes for CMIP6. Including an additional predictor variable improves the model. More specifically, we find that the model using predictor variables GSAT and AMOC performs best at predicting ODSL change at the Dutch coast for both CMIP5 and CMIP6. For most individual models, we find that an increase in GSAT, and a weakening of the AMOC, relate to an increase in ODSL along the Dutch coast. The regression analysis results are combined with Monte Carlo sampling to generate probabilistic ensembles of ODSL projections consistent with the AR6 assessed ranges of GSAT and GMTSL. This method enables us to correct the ODSL change for the high temperature bias in CMIP6 models. We find that the effect of GSAT is too small to explain the difference in ODSL between CMIP5 and CMIP6. However, we see that the sensitivity to GMTSL and AMOC increased in CMIP6 which could point to a difference in model dynamics between CMIP5 and CMIP6. Furthermore, we find that the location of deep convection is important for ODSL along the Dutch coast. We see that models that show a deep mixed layer in the Greenland Sea for the period 1975 - 2004, project a larger rise in ODSL at the Dutch coast for both ensembles."

Previous research reported on potential associations between different types of risk behavior, such as between problematic social media use (PSMU) and binge-drinking. However, insights on how this link exactly manifests are limited. This study aims to increase the insights into this potential link by including a potential moderator, namely parental monitoring. Parental monitoring is known to be a protective factor for both PSMU and problematic drinking behavior. The LEF data was used to test our hypothesized model. The sample that was used, included (N= 2103) adolescents aged 11 till 18 (M = 14.68, SD = 1.33). Based on the results of this study it was concluded that adolescents who have symptoms of PSMU are more likely to engage in binge drinking, which was in line with the expectations of this study. Parental monitoring did not moderate the relation between PSMU and binge-drinking, which was not in line with the expectations of this study. In addition, high parental monitoring seemed to be related to less binge-drinking. The findings of this study underline the importance of more research regarding the relation between PSMU and binge-drinking. Additionally, it gives information on how parents could deal with risk-behavior."

These inconsistencies lead to difficulties when trying to combine data from different sources which is also a problem for the CBG (dutch centre for genealogy), an organisation that helps people with genealogical research, since historical data is seldomly stored in a single database. There is a reliance on the ability to combine multiple data sources in order to provide a full picture of the story that the available data tells. The goal of this paper is to use a linked data approach to construct an ontology: a standardised structure with consistent rules about classes of entities in the data as well as relationships among them and their properties. This ontology facilitates compatibility, accessibility, and reusability of the CBG library database, providing the CBG with an opportunity to combine their data with other sources, but also allows the data to be more accessible for other institutions or research. This paper describes the step by step process of the ontology construction while taking lessons and considerations from other cultural heritage institutions that also make use of ontologies. The ontology is created by taking a subset from schema.org and using the Protégé application to turn this into an ontology. Main findings and lessons learned include the need for exact and explicit definition of the difference between series, volumes, and issues, as well as the choice of adding classes to increase the scope of the ontology versus the decision to keep it as simple and modular as possible. Linked data technologies are expanded upon step by step and the construction of a standardised ontology as done in this paper is a step towards improving usability as well as the knowledge base."

Towards a circular infrastructure in the Netherlands - A Mission-oriented Innovation System analysis,"['Swartjes, Jip']","['Hekkert, Marko']",2022-09-09T01:03:21Z,EN,['mission-oriented innovation System; mission-oriented innovation policy; circular economy; infrastructure sector;'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The Introduction discusses the formulation of the mission to transition towards a circular economy by 2050 set by the Dutch government to address pressing societal challenges. Here, the infrastructure sector is an important sector to become circular as it uses a vast amount of materials, energy, and water. This research aims to aid the transition by analyzing how governance actions target the systemic barriers in the innovation system, thereby taking into account the implementation and coordination of the mission at regional and local governmental levels.

The Theory section discusses the change of innovations policy towards the formulation of missions and the importance of mapping out innovation dynamics to aid the implementation and monitoring. It argues that a new innovation system perspective is needed since existing approaches are inadequate to capture the ‘wicked’ nature of societal-challenge based missions. Therefore, the ‘Mission-oriented Innovation System’ perspective was proposed, followed by an approach consisting of five stages to analyze a MIS, including a problem-solution diagnosis, structural analysis, system function analysis, systemic barrier analysis, and reflection on governance actions.

The Methodology describes the data collection methods used to analyze the case study, consisting of a policy document, event analysis, two workshops with a total of 39 participants, and 23 interviews with foursets of experts stemming from varying organizations. Through a thematic analysis, each stage of the MIS analysis was analyzed.
The Results section presents the findings of each stage of the MIS analysis. To summarize, it reveals three systemic barriers by connecting weakly fulfilled system functions with underlying structural components. The first barrier concerns the lack of development, diffusion, and adoption of knowledge. The second barrier concerns the lack of market formation, preventing innovations from scaling up. The last barrier concerns the lack of guidance and coordination. The last stage indicates that planned governance actions only partially address the barriers and provides recommendations for additional ones. 

The Discussion advocates the MIS as a useful framework and provides insights for further development, including the importance of incorporating the effect of a multi-level governance structure and increased need for (policy) coordination on a mission's progress.

The Conclusion states additional governance actions might be required to target the root causes of the systemic barriers in order to aid the transition. Where there seems to be a need for more coordination, partially because decentralized governmental organizations struggle to implement and pursue national ambitions which hampers the mission's progress."
Community renewable energy (CRE): governed democratically?,"['Jochemsen, Nenya']","['Mees, Heleen']",2022-09-09T01:03:22Z,EN,['democratic legitimacy; energy democracy; community energy; community initiatives'],Sustainable Development,"One of the biggest challenges of the 21st century is to shift from finite and fossil fuel-based energy sources to renewable and clean energy sources, in order to mitigate climate change. It is crucial that this transition enfolds democratically, to avoid the risk of exacerbating social inequalities within and between communities, instead increasing effectiveness and legitimacy of the transition and its outcomes. Practitioners and scholars increasingly point to community renewable energy (CRE) initiatives as legitimate agents in governing a democratic energy transition. In an attempt to fill the empirical knowledge gap on the often-assumed democratic legitimacy of CRE initiatives, the following research question is posed: How and to what extent is democratic legitimacy pursued and met by community renewable energy (CRE) initiatives in their governance of energy generation projects in the city of Utrecht? 

In answering this question, an analytical framework of democratic legitimacy, operationalized by indicators borrowed from literature on energy democracy, was applied to governance practices of CRE in Utrecht. In a comparative case study containing four different CRE initiatives, varying in their energy form and maturity, data was primarily collected by means of interviews and document analysis. Triangulation of data sources and methods allowed an in-depth assessment of the pursuit and success of CRE initiatives in meeting democratic principles, nuanced by analytical considerations of different project stages and effects of municipal support. 

Results show that CRE initiatives are democratically legitimate to a moderate to extensive degree, with transparency as a core principle. However, significant differences between principles and initiatives exist, so the assumption that CRE initiatives are per definition democratically legitimate is proved incorrect. Municipal support had mixed effects on the democratic legitimacy of CRE initiatives. By providing subsidies, network steering and adapting the regulatory and policy context, the municipality proved primarily supportive to input and throughput principles. Trade-offs were made by decision-makers in CRE initiatives, pressured by resource limitations and based on the perceived necessity of certain principles to achieve the envisioned outcomes, varying per initiative. Four factors that influenced differences in democratic legitimacy between initiatives included the maturity of the initiative, the pursued energy form, the complexity of the stakeholder arena and location practicalities. 

Future research could build upon this first attempt to create an analytical tool suitable to assessing democratic legitimacy in the energy sector and could assess the potential of public-private-civil partnerships in strengthening democratic capacities of CRE initiatives in their emergence and upscaling. Decision-makers in CRE initiatives are recommended to discuss a collective perception of democratic legitimacy with participants and stakeholders, and to deploy its partnerships for sharing expertise and best practices. Municipal officials and policy makers are recommended to consider the specific democratic needs of CRE initiatives and the democratic effects of municipal support, and to adapt its regulatory and policy framework to increase the administrative role and facilitation of CRE initiatives. These considerations and adaptations are necessary to steer the ongoing energy transition in a democratic and legitimate way."

Gentrification has been shown to negatively impact social cohesion through decreased neighborhood attachment and social interaction between incumbent and new residents. Therefore, tools that increase social cohesion would be beneficial to cities that have policies which result in gentrification. Urban community gardens have previously been used as a strategy to encourage social cohesion through their ability to increase social connections, and create positive atmospheres. However, these studies were not placed in the context of a gentrifying neighborhood. This led to the development of the research question, How can urban community gardens promote social cohesion amidst gentrification? Based on this, a novel conceptual framework was formulated combining previous literature similar to this topic. This framework includes four causal mechanisms of Mood-boosting, Neighborhood Attachment, Expanded Social Networks, and Empowering Participation, which were posited to result in social cohesion. An urban community garden, Vredestuin Noord was selected as the subject of this case study as it is located in a gentrifying neighborhood of Liskwartier in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Interviews based on the conceptual framework took place with both staff and volunteers of the community garden. Results from this research suggest that an urban community garden that boosts volunteers’ mood, increases neighborhood attachment, expands social networks and empowers its participants has the ability to promote social cohesion amidst gentrification. This has implications for cities who have urban renewal strategies that result in gentrification, but still desire to maintain or improve the social cohesion of their city."
Energy democracy in the warmth transition,"['Driessen, Niels']","['Witte, Patrick']",2022-09-09T01:03:20Z,EN,['Energy transition; warmth transition; warmtepomp; Energy democracy'],Spatial Planning,"According to the Dutch national government all neighborhoods need to be transitioned to sustainable heating sources by 2050. This goal, related to the phasing out of natural gas, is following up on the globally agreed sustainability goals and is recently strengthened by the will to become independent from Russian imported natural gas. Often, this warmth transition is approached from a technical perspective, but more importantly it is as much as a societal transition as well. The goals previously stated ask for speed and efficiency in the transition. The societal aspects however create an opportunity for the redistribution of power relations and enabling of collective participative communities. In the literature these collective principles are combined by the concept called energy democracy.

Several approaches were seen to promote collective participation in the transitional projects. Municipalities organized ways to collectively and efficiently provide advice on insulation measures and had thoughts on initiating collective purchasing programs. These generic approaches are especially effective for citizens living in the selected neighborhoods for this research, constructed between 1995 and 2005. Apart from the similarity in insulation standards and design these suburbs are often characterized by citizens who are able to financially invest and have the knowledge to do so. These aspects contribute to the increased participation within these generic measures in these suburbs. In suburbs with a relatively lower level of knowledge and less financial capabilities these generic measures do not have the same effect. In these cases, this generic municipal wide approach is leading to exclusion since not every citizen is able to financially invest, or has the knowledge, to contribute. Projects focusing on specific neighborhoods which include intense participation processes adapted to the target group are an opportunity for the promotion of energy democracy.

Apart from the scale and focus the energy democracy approach also comes with a change in the current governance mode. By making use of existing citizens’ networks, such as energy corporations, the power is able to be transferred from municipalities and market parties to civil society. As concluded in this research, a transition becomes theirs when they are able to decide and organize a collective transition themselves with the support of the government. Only then the sustainable energy system becomes democratically owned as in line with the principles of energy democracy. This is currently not the case in the operationalization of the transition. In this transitional phase municipalities have the potential to shift their mode of governance to self-governance and take a more supportive role. However, additional financial support from the national government is needed for municipalities to truly have the ability to implement the principles of energy democracy.

Municipalities argue that this shift is seen as complex since market parties are more benevolent in taking financial risks compared to private citizens. Large scale collective programs need pre-investments in research, tenders to select contractors and above all courage of local initiators to start without knowing if success is achieved. In comparison, market parties are used to taking these risks. This makes upscaling the principles of energy democracy questionable. More research should be conducted to the practicalities of implementing ideas on energy democracy in the field. On the other hand, municipalities are seen experimenting with multiple innovative ideas to collectively organize the all-electric transition. Sharing these innovations on nationwide platforms would help government officials in this early stage of the transition. Additionally, municipalities could make more use of the already existing energy corporations."
The Perceived Impact of the Covid-19 Recovery Funds on Primary School Leaders’ Use of Leadership for Learning Elements,"['Brouwer, Helma']","['Henrichs, Lotte']",2022-09-09T01:03:24Z,EN,['Covid-19 recovery funds; Leadership for Learning; collective efficacy; diverse team expertise'],Educational Sciences,"The Covid-19 lockdown closings raised concerns about possible learning disadvantages among students. As a result, Covid-19 recovery funds (CRF) were made available to remedy possible learning disadvantages. The purpose of these funds will be to enable schools to undertake interventions to support the students. Organizing this requires good leadership.
The current study was conducted within a school-university collaboration with SPO Utrecht, a board of public schools. It was investigated how Covid-19 recovery funds impacted primary school leaders’ use of leadership for learning (LfL) elements, including how diverse team expertise relates to collective efficacy.
A mixed-method study was conducted. Teachers filled out a survey to study how they perceived leadership, collective efficacy, and diverse team expertise. Also, school leaders were interviewed to investigate whether they use elements of leadership for learning in their leadership style before and after the Covid-19 recovery funds. Results displayed a positive effect of diverse team expertise on collective efficacy. And school leaders showed elements of LfL after using CRF. It is recommended that further research be conducted into these effects. A practical recommendation has been made to help school leaders increase diverse team expertise."
Energy justice in urban energy transitions,"['Wal, Sannah van der']","['Akerboom, Sanne']",2022-09-09T01:03:14Z,EN,['Energy justice; local governance actors; urban energy transitions; energy transition; just transitions; just governance; multi level governance'],Sustainable Development,"Cities are increasingly seen as important places to govern the energy transition. 
Even though transitions require major changes that have significant societal influence, the consideration of justice within energy policy is limited. As the energy transition is governed through multiple levels of governance, it is essential to study who has the power to allocate benefits and burdens 
across areas of society. This study builds on previous research by combining the concepts of energy justice and multi-level governance to explore the role of local governance actors in promoting just urban energy transitions. 

This research analysed the case study of the LIFE project in Amsterdam, which aims to develop an inclusive energy platform for the neighbourhood and specifically included social goals. The 
study specifically focused on whether the LIFE project could be considered just for the local residents. Through desk study, semi-structured interviews and additional data analysis, this research aimed to answer the following research question: “How is energy justice understood 
by local governance actors of urban low-carbon energy transitions and how is its 
implementation influenced by a multi-level governance context?”.

The first part of the research compared the values of local governance actors, resident representatives and residents regarding the LIFE project across the three tenets of energy justice; distributional, procedural and recognitional. The results showed that among local governance actors different emphasis was placed on including local residents and vulnerable groups among them and that they had a narrow view of distributional justice. They make an 
effort to include elements of energy justice but lack in aligning their view of what is considered just with the view of residents. 

The second part of the research showed that European and national levels of governance influence local governments by determining the overall direction of the energy transition, setting the legal framework and funding municipalities. Local governance actors are, however, 
more influential over elements of energy justice within the local implementation of energy strategies and projects, as they can use their policy instruments to decrease financial inequalities, improve elements of procedural justice and specifically target disadvantaged 
groups by promoting social initiatives.

This study showed that even when energy projects specifically include social goals, this does not necessarily result in just decision-making. All in all, local governance actors could do more to promote just transitions by enhancing their understanding of energy justice ansld broadening the implementation of local policy instruments"
A partial solution to the similarity extension problem,"['Keuper, Noah']","['Marseglia, Stefano']",2022-09-09T01:03:13Z,EN,['Conjugacy Extension Theorem; Conjugacy Extension Problem; Similarity Extension Theorem; Similarity Extension Problem; LM-correspondence; 2x2 matrices'],Mathematical Sciences,"The Similarity Extension Theorem roughly states that two matrices are similar over every localisation of a specific ring if and only if there is a finite integral extension of that ring where they are similar. Since the Similarity Extension Theorem was proved a question that remained was finding this extension. The goal of this thesis is to dive into this problem and propose a method of solving it in a specific setting, with the hope that this can be extended to a broader setting in the future. This was done by going over the proof of the Similarity Extension Theorem and trying to adapt it by using a theorem from Watson such that it returns an explicit extension. We succeeded in finding a method that returns a solution for two 2x2 matrices with some additional conditions. However we suspect some of these conditions can be avoided or relaxed with some additional research. This method therefore could be a good addition to current methods whenever we are looking at 2x2 matrices. And can be a start for anyone trying to generalise this method to larger matrices."
The application of process mining in determining employee well-being,"['Lugtigheid, Sven']","['Beerepoot, Iris']",2022-09-09T01:03:12Z,EN,"['Process mining, Employee well-being, Job demand-resource model, Organisational mining and Resource mining']",Business Informatics,"The monitoring of well-being has become increasingly popular in the last decade as higher employee well-being results in better performance and reduces the number of burnouts. Surveys and interviews are the most popular instruments for determining well-being. However, these instruments are cross-sectional, making it difficult to continuously monitor well-being. Process mining is a discipline that has the potential to measure well-being without this drawback. This project investigates to what degree work-related parts (job demands & resources) of well-being can be determined with process mining. 

A literature study revealed that five job demands & resources can be measured based on human behaviour, these being: workload, time pressure, monotonous work, autonomy and social support. These five can measure burnout, boredom and work engagement to a great extent. We investigated which process mining 
techniques are related to the selected job demands & resources. We observed that workload, time pressure, monotonous work and autonomy can be measured in their entirety through process mining whilst social support can be measured partially.

Finally, a case study was conducted to analyse whether the proposed application of measuring the job demands & resources is correct. Four of the five job demands & resources have a medium correlation with the key strain or motivation that they theoretically should measure. Only time pressure has no significant relation with its theoretical strain, burnout. 

To conclude, three out of the five job demands & resources, workload, monotonous work, and autonomy, can be measured entirely using process mining and one, social support, partly."

Cycling highways and resistance: How citizen participation can influence citizens' resistance to cycling highway projects,"['Schreurs, Koen']","['Pilo, Francesca']",2022-09-09T02:01:26Z,EN,['cycling highway; resistance; split ladder of participation; NIMBY; citizen participation'],Spatial Planning,"Since the last decade, cycling highways have been used as a means of combating traffic jams, but in the Netherlands these cycling highway planning projects are often confronted with public resistance (Beijnink, 2021; EenVandaag, 2019; Guit, 2021; Hellegers, 2021; Hilbers et al., 2021; Leeflang, 2021; Polman, 2018; Redactie, 2019; Savenije, 2020; Schilthuizen, 2022). In the coming years, expanding the national cycling highway network will play an increasingly important role to combating traffic jams and improving the accessibility of cities and regions, but also stimulating bicycle use in the Netherlands in general (Ministerie van Algemene Zaken, 2019). A cycling highway is geographically more complex and larger than an average location-based spatial project often running through several provinces, making it unclear who has the interest, who has the lead, and whether the right form of citizen participation is being applied. This research is set up to contribute to a better understanding of citizens' resistance to cycling highway projects, more specifically on how participatory processes change the level of citizens’ resistance during the planning process of these cycling highway projects. Therefore, the following research question is formulated:

How does the participatory process during the planning process of a cycling highway  change the level of citizens' resistance to the cycling highway project?

The study is set up to qualitatively analyse the views and considerations of planning officials, cycling experts, civil servants, and citizens on resistance to cycling highway projects. This is done by interviewing planning officials, cycling experts, civil servants, and citizens that have experience with citizens’ resistance in planning processes. A literature review on infrastructural projects from a planning perspective and citizens’ resistance forms the basis for the semi-structured interviews. Questions are asked about their experiences with resistance, citizen participation, power relations, and what can be learned from their experiences in terms of citizens’ resistance to cycling highway projects. Based on the theories and concepts described in this thesis, the conceptual framework outlines how levels of participation, and levels of trust and problem-solving influence levels of citizens' resistance to location-based spatial projects. Less is known about which factors cause resistance in cycling highway planning processes and how participatory processes change the level of citizens’ resistance during the planning process of these cycling highway projects. Based on multiple criteria, the cycling highway Cuijk – Mook – Nijmegen (known as MaasWaalpad) was chosen as a case study, which had resistance in several places along the trajectory: Resistance in Lierdal (Vereniging Bos en Kuil) and resistance in Cuijk."

Anti-partyist sentiments and institutional resilience. Why Italian anti-party politicians did not produce institutional change in the 1990s,"['Noord, Daniël van']","['Corduwener, Pepijn']",2022-09-09T02:03:35Z,EN,['anti-party sentiments; institutional change; Italy; Second Republic; institutional resilience;'],History,"At the start of the 1990s, a combination of domestic and international factors contributed to a rapid decline in legitimacy for the traditional political parties and growth of anti-party sentiments in Italy. Because of the strong connection between parties and Italian democratic institutions this also led to a decline in the legitimacy of these institutions, which created momentum for institutional reform. With the electoral victory of the anti-party coalition in 1994 hopes for additional reform were high. However, in 1998 very little reform had been achieved: rather than change the period consisted mostly of institutional resilience. By analysing parliamentary debates and using anti-party and historical institutionalist literature this study investigates the paradox of an electorally successful movement calling for institutional change and subsequent institutional resilience. It builds upon the distinction between those anti- partyists who oppose parties per se or in general and those who oppose only incumbent or specific parties. The analysis shows that their institutional effects are so different that it is debatable whether general and specific anti-partyism should be considered two variants of the same sentiment. Furthermore, it shows that institutional resilience is not only the result of pre- existing constraints and limited actor agency, but also of the existence of actors that seek continuity while actively masking as agents that desire change. This does not only explain the lack of institutional change in Italy but may also indicate the institutional effect of anti-party sentiments and politicians in other countries and periods."
Towards Increasing Robustness Against Occlusions for Preterm Infant Pose Estimation in Videos,"['Navarro San Martin, Roberto']","['Poppe, Ronald']",2022-09-09T02:03:29Z,EN,"['Computer Vision, Infants, NICU, TCN, CNN, Pose Estimation, Deep Learning, AI']",Artificial Intelligence,"Preterm Infant birth rates are rising globally; the causes and implications are yet not fully understood. However, it is clear that preterm infants are more likely to develop a myriad of developmental disorders in comparison to full-term infants. Given the sensitive nature of these infants, they require extensive monitoring and supervision. This monitoring is often performed in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). Current techniques for monitoring infant activity are obtrusive as they require the use of needles and electrodes which can be painful or uncomfortable for the preterm infants. Recently, there has been a surge in unobtrusive monitoring techniques, in particular video-based approaches. These approaches rely on behavioral signals present in video which can be captured by estimating the pose and motion of the infants. Current SOTA systems rely on models trained predominantly on adults to estimate the pose and motion of infants, which lead to significantly worse performance scores in down-stream tasks. Additionally, infant data is often extremely hard to collect and of low quality, with poor lighting conditions, severe perspective distortions and occlusions; this lack of data makes it hard to train deep-learning models which are known to be data reliant. Due to the low quantity of data available, this research created the Synthetic (and real) Preterm Infant Sequences (SPIS) dataset by leveraging a SMIL, a vertex-based statistical volumetric model, and SMPLify, a 2D-to-3D lifting approach to create augmented sequences of synthetic infants. This dataset was then used to train the Preterm Infant Pose Estimator (PIPE) model for infant motion modeling. Additionally, to tackle the challenges of occlusions in the preterm infant domain an occlusion augmentation module for Temporal Convolutional Networks was developed. An ablation study was performed in order to validate the performance of the PIPE for medical applications. This work identified that the occlusion augmentation technique was not sufficient for the preterm infant domain. Additionally, the results indicated that the fine tuning the pose estimation and temporal convolutional networks to preterm infant motion improved the performance of the PIPE architecture significantly, indicating that further work into the preterm infant domain for pose estimation is required. Overall, the PIPE architecture did not achieve results that were sufficient enough to be used for subsequent tasks in the preterm infant domain."

This agreement between law and prose provides grounds for the mutual influence between these two categories, not in the least as some of the passages within the laws appear almost verbatim in the prose tales. The similarities between the genres of prose and law, as well as the possibility to insult a person and therewith cause a loss of status, have given rise to the main question whether the insults and compliments in the prose tales are derivative of actual societal norms and values as specified by the laws. And where the laws give examples of insult, contemporaneous Welsh praise poetry provides a baseline for specific commendable characteristics such as generosity, wisdom, and beauty, which occur to some degree in prose as well."

It is attempted to discover how energy justice is envisioned by the government through a policy analysis, and how citizens strategize to gain benefits or avoid burdens of the transition by interviews with citizens of Meeden. The policy analysis is conducted on two documents, the Energietransitieplan 2015-2019 and the Inpassingsplan 2017. Energy justice is envisioned as participation and compensation. Citizens of Meeden indicated that there should be an equal distribution of burdens and benefits, options for participation, and revenues should be invested in the area. Participation methods have, so far, felt like ‘checking a box’ and not as a chance for them to join in the decision-making process. They deployed several strategies in attempt to increase their influence. These included, among other things, the foundation of a citizen protest group, collecting signatures, or occupying the local townhouse. For the energy transition to be just, inclusion and participation can play important roles in increasing social acceptance, driving innovation, and distribute the burdens and benefits equally."
Small Islands – Large climate change challenges. Household resilience to climate change vulnerabilities - a case study of Bonaire,"['Zander, Nina']","['Dittgen, Romain']",2022-09-09T02:03:38Z,EN,['climate resilience; household climate resilience; Small Islands (SI); Caribbean Small Islands; Bonaire'],International Development Studies,"Small Islands (SIs) often have a small capacity to resist or recover from the increasing impacts of climate change and, therefore, increasing climate resilience is necessary. However, knowledge and research on climate resilience, especially in the context of (Caribbean) SIs are limited in number and quality, although imperative for increasing it. Additionally, research, while proven beneficial, often overlooks the household-level. Therefore, this study researched household climate resilience (HCR) in Caribbean SI-context – in this case Bonaire. Since the aspects determining HCR depend on geographic context, this context was first studied for Bonaire. Through 13 key-informant interviews, complemented by desk research, the main climate vulnerabilities, their impact on Bonaire and its households, and the aspects making Bonairean households resilient for these were identified. These aspects were used as indicators to form a composite score measuring HCR through online household surveys. Hereby, the barriers to HCR and differences in HCR between socio-demographic groups were identified. Results showed an average HCR-score for the sample (N=183) of .455 out of 1 (SD=.11) – indicating HCR is not low, but also not high. The following aspects negatively contributed to HCR: expected damage to homes, amount of savings, insurance covering damage from climate change (vulnerabilities), incomes, dependent income sources, vulnerable neighbourhoods, alternatives to electricity, water, and food, social resilience, community response, government response, awareness of climate change, information and education on climate change impacts, and steps to prepare for this. Furthermore, the following households are less inclined to be climate resilient: bigger households, households with high kid ratios, households with younger household heads, households speaking fewer languages, households not fluently speaking English, and households with a higher level of obtained education. This study knows limitations that possibly impacted these results, like the limited representativeness of the household sample. Although this study adds to the knowledge base of SI-context HCR, additional research is beneficial. Therefore, recommendations for further research are provided. The same goes for policy recommendations."

Traditional methods of mapping UGS are mainly field surveys, however, the development of (very) high-resolution satellite images, together with machine learning and deep learning techniques has provided a faster way of extracting UGS at a large scale. This paper employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to conduct semantic segmentation of UGS from Sentinel-2 imagery for multiple cities around the globe. The main architectures used were U-Net model from base level and U-Net model with ResNet-50 and VGG-16 backbones pretrained on ImageNet. Results show that U-Net with pretrained ResNet-50 backbone achieved the best performance, with the average OA, IoU, F-score, and AUC of 0.9695, 0.9188, 0.9572, and 0.9584. When testing our model on external cities, the metrics above became 0.8767, 0.5570, 0.6448, and 0.6534, respectively, showing a relatively good generalization ability of the model to predict UGSs where benchmark city data is not available, for instance, cities in the global south. Moreover, our model identified some UGSs which are not in the ground truth datasets because of the hard definition of UGS, such as golf courses and cemeteries. However, since these areas indeed provide similar functions and benefits as UGSs, we argue that our model might be a potentially effective way to get more complete datasets for UGS distributions."
The Impact of Maternal Mental Health on Infant Temperament in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"['Aalbers, Vera']","['Junge, C.M.M.']",2022-09-09T02:03:32Z,EN,['Maternal anxiety; infant temperament; COVID-19 pandemic; surgency; negative affect; effortful control'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Aims: To determine associations between maternal pregnancy and parenting related anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent infant temperament development at 3 to 6 months old, as well as to determine significant contextual mediators.

Study design: 380 mother-infant dyads from across the United Kingdom reported on their pregnancy and parenting related anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. At 3 to 6 months postnatally, they also reported on aspects of their infant’s temperament, ranging from surgency (responsiveness and positive emotions), negative affect (negative emotions), and effortful control (ability to regulate emotions). Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to examine the expected association between prenatal maternal mental health and infant temperament traits, controlling for contemporaneous maternal mental health. Maternal and infant characteristics were examined as potential mediating factors.

Results: Pregnancy and parenting related anxiety were associated with less favourable infant surgency and negative affect, when controlling for contextual variables. Effortful control, however, was not related to maternal mental health over the course of the pandemic. Gestational age, general maternal anxiety levels, and maternal education were all correlated with surgency, either directly and/or mediated by parenting related anxiety scores.

Conclusion: The findings of this study underline the importance of paying attention to the mental health of expectant and new mothers during the COVID-19 situation and potential future pandemics, as it may be related to their infants’ temperament development in their first months of life."
"Energy Transition in the Municipality of Utrecht:
An outlook on inclusivity within public participation, the energy

the Netherlands specifically, rising sea levels, loss of biodiversity, extreme weather occurrences and 
air pollution could seriously jeopardize quality of life. One of the contributing factors towards the 
problem is the way society uses and produces energy in a harmful way towards the environment.
The use of non-renewable sources of energy is contributing to this problem in the Netherlands. The 
energy transition towards sustainable energy sources by 2050 requires impactful alterations 
throughout European countries down to local municipalities in various states Netherlands. Within 
the scope of the Participatory Value Evaluation, Customer Journey model and in light of the

Those images widely deal with forms of female as well as Jewish alterity which are, as will be demonstrated, interwoven in the novel in a complex way. The academic background of this contribution consists of a research landscape that lacks clarity, had problems in interpreting the novel and, therefore, often lead to questionable conclusions. Based on a broad analysis of the images of the female as well as the Jewish ‘Other’ used in Kolmar’s novel this thesis aims to fill some of these gaps in research. At the same time, it shall be demonstrated how those images are, not least as a result of an unconventional reinterpretation of the myth of Medea, are deconstructed in the course of the narration. Eventually, it is intended to show in which way Gertrud Kolmar initially allegedly mimes the western-occidental discourse of her time in order to let its logic burst by adding subtle and differentiated modifications.  For reaching this goal this paper makes use of the technique of close reading as well as insights from the field of discourse analysis and feminist deconstruction."
"Theatre of the Real and Public Space as a Platform for Social Engagement

Taking as my main case study the performative protest Inventory that occurred in Eleusis, Greece in 2018, my research question is formulated as such: How does Inventory as theatre of the real employ archival materials and public space in order to activate social engagement?
In this thesis, I argue that an artistic re-interpretation and re-presentation of a fact can present a version of the truth, while at the same time it places the spectators in positions where they gain social awareness and they develop social engagement. To support this view, I conducted research thinking of theatre as one of the most vital aspects of life that intervenes in the personal and political and gives voice to the voiceless.
Initially, drawing from the field of theatre and performance studies, I use materials from Peggy Phelan, Diana Taylor, Rebecca Schneider, Myriam Van Imschoot and Jeroen Peeters. These authors approached the archival logic differently and created the framework for the relationship between the performance and the archive. My first chapter is dependent on Carol Martin, Jules Odendahl-James, Janelle Reinelt, Claire Bishop and Amelia Parenteau who discuss the characteristics of theatre of the real and documentary theatre, explaining the tendency of theatre-makers to compose factual materials with aesthetic imaginaries (Chapter 1). Next, I continue with texts from Sigrid Merx, Liesbeth Groot Nibbelink, and Christopher Balme who place the public space in the center of attention. These authors investigate how public space performances can transform the audiences and passers-by into dynamic compositional forces of artworks, how they provide them with visibility and how the space functions as a platform for the development of democracy (Chapter 2). Lastly, my collaboration with the choreographer Tzeni Argyriou and visual artist Vassilis Gerodimos in Inventory and the dramaturgical triad addressed by Merx and Groot Nibbelink; composition, spectator and context constitute the dramaturgical analysis of the performance, where the theories from the first two chapters are applied (Chapter 3). 
In this thesis, I create a research method that unfolds the main aspects of Inventory. Starting by introducing theatre of the real and documentary theatre, I create a map of how theatre uses stories that have been forgotten, bringing them to the fore and activating them in the present. Starting the research from the function of archives in contemporary performances, I proceed to public space. Public space in this thesis is primarily associated with reality, sociability and politicization. In this research, I think of both archives and public spaces as pivotal and radical elements of theatre. Therefore, I suggest that when these two are combined, the result is a theatre of the streets, of reality, of the past that comes and touches the present and re-frames it with one single vision: social change."
"Assyrië is van iedereen, behalve van de Assyriërs","['Mussa, Christin Mussa']","['Meulen, Sjoukje van der']",2022-09-09T03:01:31Z,EN,['Assyrië; kolonialisme; postkolonialisme; oriëntalisme; britisch museum; westen;'],Kunstgeschiedenis,"In 2019 vond de tentoonstelling I am Ashurbanipal king of the world, king of Assyria plaats in het British Museum. De tentoonstelling was geheel gewijd aan de Assyrische koning Ashurbanipal en zijn liefde voor spectaculaire paleizen, zijn meedogenloze behandeling van vijanden en het bewaren van kennis in de eerste bibliotheek ter wereld. Kort na opening sprak de Assyrian Confederation of Europe het museum aan op het niet benoemen van het bestaan van de moderne Assyriërs. De tentoonstelling beschreef het verhaal van een uitgestorven cultuur met allerlei clichés en stereotyperingen van deze oude beschaving. Bij nader onderzoek blijkt dit narratief met betrekking tot Assyrië de literatuur en het wetenschappelijke discours te domineren. 
 
Het discours rond Assyrië is in de negentiende eeuw in het Westen door westerse historici gevoerd. In 1842 begonnen de archeologische opgravingen door Engeland en Frankrijk in Mesopotamië, destijds onderdeel van het Ottomaanse Rijk. Dit leverde naast de reeds aanwezige tekstuele bronnen, ook artefactueel bewijs op voor het bestaan van deze beschaving. Sinds de archeologische opgravingen in de negentiende eeuw in Mesopotamië, is Assyrië onderworpen geweest aan imperialistische, nationalistische en koloniale inmenging door het Westen. 

In dit onderzoek is het niet benoemen van het bestaan van de moderne Assyriërs door het British Museum het start- en kernpunt. Omdat dit gegeven in verbinding staat met het stereotiep narratief over Assyrië uit de negentiende eeuw, luidt de onderzoeksvraag: In hoeverre wijst het niet benoemen van de moderne Assyriërs in het huidige westerse kunsthistorische discours op een continuering van het negentiende-eeuwse westers imperialisme?

Door een cultuurkritische en met name postkoloniale lens wordt het kunsthistorisch discours rond Assyrië in het Westen beschouwd en geanalyseerd. Belangrijke theorieën, die zijn voortgekomen uit het postkoloniaal discours en de invloed van het negentiende-eeuwse Westers imperialisme op gemarginaliseerde culturen hebben onderzocht, vormen de theoretische kern van dit onderzoek. De problematiek aangaande het discours rond Assyrië en de invloed daarvan wordt zichtbaar door analyse van de tekst bij de vaste tentoonstelling Assyrië in het British Museum op metonymische elementen."

Through a qualitative study based on 16 interviews conducted in Kosovo in the Spring of 2022, it finds that the issue of missing persons does not in itself foster distrust between the communities. Yet, by being increasingly politicized by both sides, and by playing into existing war narratives that are reinforced by a lack of contact between the groups, it continues to impact intergroup trust in Kosovo as long as it remains unresolved, and as long as families of missing persons are forced to experience ambiguous loss. While much research has examined how it impacts families to not know what has happened to a missing loved, this study contributes to a better understanding of the consequences of ambiguous loss on an intergroup level, and how the legacies of Kosovo conflict (1998-99) impact the relations between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo today."
Improving online  rating systems using machine learning,"['Dalsum, Bas van']","['Corten, Rense']",2022-09-09T03:01:22Z,EN,"['Machine Learning, reviews, dutch language, NLP']",Applied Data Science,"The online marketplace relies heavily on reviews to establish trust between the customer and the seller. These reviews are often both in written and star-rating form. In this paper, I use reviews scraped from the site werkspot.nl, a Dutch online market platform for small construction work, to analyse the sentiment reflected in the written review, and to predict the rated amount of stars. This study aims to investigate if the rating system can be improved by recommending star ratings based on the written review. I train a deep learning-based Bi-directional Short and Long Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict both the multi-class (5-star rating) and the binary sentiment (positive or negative) rating. 
    The results suggest that this method has the potential to be of use for this application, but there are some issues to be resolved before this is possible. For instance, both models suffer from overfitting on the training data, resulting in lower model performance scores when testing the model on untrained data. One of the likely reasons for this is the extreme disparity between high and low ratings in the data. I elaborate more on this further in this paper. Overall, the main finding is that while the training results for both binary and multi-class are good, improvement is necessary to implement the model in real-world applications."

It turns out that with the methods discussed in this thesis, it is not possible to extract questions and classify multiple choice questions with high accuracy. Also, there are some robustness concerns discussed in this thesis. In this research, the classification of multiple choice questions turns out to be most successful with a convolving measure of dissimilarity as defined in this paper, in combination with a decision tree classifier, to an accuracy of 99.49%. However, due to an accuracy of the preprocessing of 91.14%, the accuracy of the total process is insufficient to be applicable, since it is 90.68%. In conclusion, it is not advised for CITO to implement the methods discussed in this research for the automatic grading of multiple choice questions."

This thesis looks into the way liveness in a livestreamed performance of electronic music can be increased. Although a livestreamed concert should not be compared to a physical concert, some theories on liveness in the physical performance of electronic music also apply to digital performance. One of the major influences on liveness in both modes of performance is the amount of visual agency, as the audience should be able to connect visual cues to sonic elements. In livestreamed concerts, interactivity and intimacy are elements that can increase the liveness and make it a unique experience. This thesis discusses two case studies of livestreaming platform GÂRDEN that underline the importance of visual agency and show how it can influence the matter of liveness of the performance. They also show how the cameras can influence the visual agency both positively and negatively. The case studies also include an effective and a less effective attempt at interactivity and intimacy, showing the difficulties of turning a livestreamed performance of electronic music into a unique experience."

De opkomst voor deze verkiezingen lag rond de 50 procent, terwijl de opkomst bij de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen rond de 80 procent ligt. Uit onderzoek van Ipsos bleek dat jongeren tussen de 18 en 24 jaar voornamelijk thuisblijven in plaats van dat zij naar de stembus gaan. Een laag opkomstpercentage, zorgt voor problemen. Bij een lage opkomst is de uitslag namelijk niet representatief en kan de legitimiteit van de gekozen partijen in twijfel worden getrokken. Het doel van huidig onderzoek is daarom om inzichten te tonen in het stemgedrag van jongeren. Door middel van interviews worden stemmotieven van jongeren in beeld gebracht en wordt de stembereidheid van hen gepeild. De uitkomsten van huidig onderzoek kunnen daarmee op de lange termijn wellicht bijdragen aan het verhogen van het stempercentage. Daarnaast dient huidig onderzoek als aanvulling op de wetenschappelijke literatuur, omdat kwalitatieve onderzoeken naar de stembereidheid van jongeren nog niet vaak zijn uitgevoerd. 
	Allereerst is er een literatuuronderzoek uitgevoerd, waarin eerdere onderzoeken naar dit fenomeen zijn behandeld en zijn de belangrijkste begrippen uitgelegd. Daarna is er een empirisch onderzoek uitgevoerd. Dit onderzoek was kwalitatief van aard. Er werden namelijk achttien interviews afgenomen met respondenten uit verschillende leeftijdsgroepen. De interviews zijn hierna gecodeerd en geanalyseerd middels het computerprogramma Nvivo 20.	In het resultatenhoofdstuk is allereerst de vragenlijst uitgelegd, die op basis van het literatuuronderzoek tot stand is gekomen. De uitkomsten van huidig onderzoek zijn verdeeld in vijf punten: het belang van stemmen, de lage stembereidheid, de directe omgeving, de campagnes en voorlichtingen en het bevorderen van de stembereidheid. Uit de resultaten bleek onder andere dat jongeren tussen de 18 en 24 jaar zich minder politiek betrokken voelden dan andere leeftijdsgroepen. Zo volgden zij het politieke nieuws minder, vonden ze de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen oninteressant en was er geen rol weggelegd voor hun directe omgeving. Tevens vonden zij de campagnes en voorlichtingen van de overheid en de deelnemende partijen onvoldoende. Ook zouden jongeren op basis van de theorie van beredeneerd handelen eerder de intentie krijgen om niet te stemmen.  Een specifieke groep jongeren was minder gemotiveerd om te gaan stemmen dan anderen: de first time voters. Zo waren zij minder politiek betrokken, vonden zij stemmen niet belangrijk en ontbraken gesprekken met hun directe omgeving over de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen. 
	Er kan geconcludeerd worden dat huidig onderzoek een beter inzicht heeft gegeven in de stembereidheid van jongeren tussen de 18 en 24 jaar tijdens de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen van 2022. Echter, er is nog volop ruimte voor vervolgonderzoek. Zo kan er bijvoorbeeld een longitudinaal onderzoek worden uitgevoerd naar de stembereidheid van jongeren, of kunnen campagnes en voorlichtingen van de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen worden onderzocht om te zoeken naar verbeterpunten."

How these challenges can be addressed on the secondary level remains understudied. This research aimed to fill that knowledge gap by studying a Dutch case of a blended course for high-performing students aged 15-18. We studied how the educational video clips, hand-in tasks, and face-to-face sessions contribute to the students’ experiences in a blended upper secondary mathematics course. We focused on experiences of flexibility, interaction, learning processes, and learning climate. We interviewed eight students, across four schools, in addition to four teachers and one designer of the course, and coded the interviews using a priori coding. We conclude that all three aspects, face-to-face sessions, hand-in exercises, and videos contribute to students experiencing flexibility in a blended course, leading to a good learning climate. However, flexibility causes poor time management among some students. Interaction with peers helps students to organize their learning process. Our research also suggests that enthusiastic presenters and elaborate feedback can improve students’ opinions on the course. Remarkably, some students found a blended course not much different from their regular non-blended courses. Our results underline that students that forego most aspects that distinguish a blended course from an online course often experience a worse learning climate than students that embrace both the online and the face-to-face aspects of a blended course."

important influence on the decisions related to pursuing higher levels of education. 
Additionally, we employ structural equation path analysis model in order to explore the 
relationship between gender role attitudes, the level of education and the weekly hours of work

dramatic. It is found that traditional attitudes substantially reduce the investment in education 
and that attitudes have crucial effect on the hours of work women spend within a week. We 
conclude that gender role attitudes have a significant and large impact on the decision of 
women in the Netherlands to invest in their education on the one hand, and on the decision to 
participate in the labour market on the other."

International Conflict Resolution through Mediation: Under which Conditions does the European Union effectively mediate?,"['Jaumann, Elli']","['Esch, Femke van']",2022-09-09T03:03:04Z,EN,[],European Governance,"Although the European Union can be considered the most successful internal peace project in history, 
it is questionable whether the EU successfully acts as a global security player externally. This thesis, 
therefore, examines the role of the EU as an inter- and intrastate mediator and explores the question 
of whether and under which conditions the EU is effective in its mediation efforts. The 
conceptualization of mediation effectiveness consists of a two-dimensional theoretical framework that 
distinguishes between objective effectiveness – whether and to what extent a peace agreement was 
signed – and subjective effectiveness in terms of internal EU goal-attainment. To empirically measure
the effectiveness of mediation, qualitative case studies and qualitative comparative analysis (QcA) are
conducted. The empirical analyses aim at identifying common conditions among the cases influencing 
mediation effectiveness and thus, determining under which conditions the EU mediates effectively, 
respectively ineffectively. The conditions influencing mediation effectiveness can be differentiated into
two dimensions: 1. Concurrent factors which can be understood as characteristics and behaviour of a 
mediator, such as the mediator’s leverage, coherence, and mediation strategy, and 2. Context factors, 
such as the severity of the crisis and the conflicting party’s willingness to compromise. The empirical
results show, firstly, that the EU overall does not exceed a medium degree of effectiveness in direct 
mediation cases, but the EU ismore effective when mediating as the sole mediator in a specific conflict. 
Secondly, leverage and coherence of a mediator are necessary conditions for mediation to be effective, 
and together with the conflicting parties’ willingness to compromise, these conditions are considered
sufficient to explain mediation effectiveness. These results entail important policy recommendations 
for the EU to change its mediation behaviour and to adopt the mediation approach to the context of a 
specific crisis."

In this thesis, I posit the postpartum as an entrance point, a portal, to lean into the inherent transformational and vulnerable characteristics of humanity that are so often denied, especially to women and mothers, in Western philosophy. This study is based in posthumanist theory (Braidotti, 2013) in which the Western idea of the individual and the contained subject is problematized to imagine an alternative relational and situated subjectivity. I use arts-based methods, working with the medium of linocut printing to allow participants to explore conceptions of the postpartum in focus groups. I discuss how the medium of linocut printing provides a unique way for the participants to process their ideas and reflection and argue for this medium to be incorporated into arts-based research. 

Throughout this study, I argue that experiences and perceptions of the postpartum period by women/birthing people located within Europe can challenge Western conceptions of the human by reclaiming the abject liquids associated with this time, advocating for increased vulnerability and care, rethinking static conceptions of the body that are contained by the skin, and troubling the self/other binary. The troubling of the self/other binary in the postpartum is explored both through the relationships between birth giver, child, and community and through cultural food-based rituals, which showed how food in the postpartum moved between the self and the other as a connecting force, creating alternative meanings in Western and non-Western traditions (food as regulation and control vs. care). I discuss the philosophy behind “bounce back culture”- in which women in the West are expected to bounce back to their pre-pregnant state after birth, and analyze the negative affects this mindset has. I put forward a new feminist figuration: the Posthuman Postpartum, that confirms and expands upon posthuman theory by questioning the assumed separation involved in birth and further problematizing food as a relational and culturally situated force."

This study focuses on sustainable use (i.e. frequent usage over a longer period of time) of the Tovertafel for people living with dementia, which is an interactive serious gaming projector meant to improve the user’s Quality of Life. The research question is as follows: How have care homes in the Netherlands and Belgium that master sustainable use of the Tovertafel dealt with barriers to sustainable use and implemented its facilitators successfully, and what can be learned from these care homes to support sustainable use in other care homes? To be able to answer this question, the project consisted of three phases. During the first phase, a literature study was done on the Tovertafel, dementia, sustainable use and the factors influencing usage (i.e. facilitators and barriers of sustainable use). Simultaneously a prestudy containing quantitative analysis of Tovertafel usage data and qualitative interviews with Tover employees was conducted. This resulted in a clear definition of the scope of this study and an overview of the needed theoretical background. The second phase consisted of a quantitative survey among Tovertafel users to elucidate the definition of sustainable use and select the interview participants for the third phase in a grounded way. From this study we can conclude that sustainable use of the Tovertafel is defined as usage of at least three times per week (i.e. above-median), six months after installation (i.e. when the novelty effect was expected to be worn off). Frequent users turned out to be more satisfied with their usage frequency (58%) than infrequent users (20%) and therefore one could say that a minimum usage frequency of three times per week should be promoted among new and current users to facilitate sustainable use. The third phase of this study contained in-depth follow-up interviews among care homes mastering sustainable use. During the interviews, care home employees mastering sustainable use elaborated on their perception of the facilitators for sustainable use and potential support measures that could help them and others to keep using the Tovertafel frequently. Based on the findings, a framework for facilitators of sustainable use has been developed, including an extended version showing the related concepts. Having a usage-coordinator, and employees being sufficiently willing and having sufficient knowledge were the most often implemented facilitators. Together with having an engaging technology, these facilitators were perceived as most important by the participants. The biggest hurdles were unmotivated colleagues, an insufficient variety of user experiences, and the complexity of rotating the Tovertafel. By maximizing the facilitators and minimizing the barriers, sustainable use will be facilitated and therefore one will benefit from its advantages longer."
Exploring Gender Roles and Sigmund Freud’s Taboo in the Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin,"['Werdnik, Paula']","['Borzaga, Michela']",2022-09-09T04:02:27Z,EN,['Taboo; gender roles; Anais Nin; diary; diary writing; psychoanalysis; self-representation; women writers; feminist literature; censorship; the self;'],Literatuur vandaag,"This Master's thesis explores Anais Nin's controversial first unexpurgated diary, titled Henry & June. The thesis explores the ways in which the diary has been an influential literary space of self-representation for women writers, both as a platform of self-fashioning and as a safe space for exploring taboo topics. This thesis explores various taboo notions such as lesbian desire, queerness, non-monogamous relationships, female sexuality, incest, the fragmented self, and childhood trauma. Sigmund Freud's notions of the taboo and pscyhoanalysis, as defined in Totem and Taboo (1913), act as a theoretical framework within this thesis.

While the diary has historically received less critical attention than other life-writing genres such as the autobiography, this thesis proposes that the diary can act as a feminist literary space in which conventional gender roles can be challenged through writing, the self can be explored, and taboo topics can be addressed."

Let’s break the ice: an experimental investigation of the effect of team building on human-robot interaction,"['Liu, Catherine']","['Hortensius, Ruud']",2022-09-09T04:02:32Z,EN,['social robotics; team building interventions; human-robot teaming; collaboration'],Applied Cognitive Psychology,"As the field of mobile robotics advances, autonomous robots are becoming more capable of collaborating with their human counterpart. However, in order to have social robots working alongside in our everyday life, much work remains to be done to improve the social interaction between humans and robots. As a result, we conducted a lab study that experimentally evaluated the effect of a team building intervention on people’s short- and long-term perceptions of a social robot. 61 participants took part in a collaborative quiz game using a commercially available robot, with half of them engaging in a range of team building exercises and the rest simply finishing the game. The exercises included setting goals, clarifying job roles, and developing interpersonal relations. The quiz game was followed by a social interaction, which participants repeated the next week with no exposure to the robot in between. The findings suggest the intervention did not yield to a more positive view of robot or the experiences, and that the perceived robotic traits and the experiences remained stable over time. However, we discovered that individuals who felt more strongly connected with the robot had a more positive perception and interaction experiences, demonstrating the potential benefits of building a cooperative relationship at an early stage of human-robot interaction. The findings offer practical implications for robotic developers to consider incorporate a fun and engaging collaborative game that helps “break the ice” when introducing social robots for the first time. Future research is required to investigate how a collaborative game influences team identification, as well as other team perceptions and cooperative behaviors."
Belfast’s 21st Century Apartheid: How Does Segregation Influence How Catholic Youth Experience and Navigate Life in Belfast?,"['Kinney, Eli']","['Slooter, Luuk']",2022-09-09T04:02:18Z,EN,['Segregation; Ethnic division; Spatial formation of identity; Everyday peace; Belfast;'],Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"This thesis explores how the entrenched segregation of Belfast’s Catholic and Protestant communities influences the daily experiences and navigation of life for Catholic youth growing up in the post-conflict city. To address this inquiry, a qualitative ethnographic approach was conducted to understand how segregation, and the mechanisms that maintain it such as Belfast’s interface barriers, combative discursive landscapes, and schools and sports give rise to the making of place. The range of meanings attached to Belfast’s segregated spaces influences social norms, patterns of living and ultimately assists with the formation and (re)production of social identities. I argue that the array of meanings derived from segregated (and non-segregated) spaces in Belfast determines how Catholic youth experience and navigate their life throughout the city. To interpret their varied behaviour and strategies to navigate life in different parts of the city, I utilised Mac Ginty’s (2014) framework of everyday peace to facilitate a dialogue between the empirical evidence and theory. The thesis concludes by arguing that segregation plays a fundamental role in shaping patterns of life for youth and it ultimately dictates the strategies used to cope with and navigate life in a deeply-divided post-conflict society."

ladina-mestiza political identity within the Guatemalan context and women’s movement,
mainly based in two decolonial feminist perspectives. First, the new mestiza consciousness of
Gloria Anzaldúa (1987) and secondly, in the ladina-mestiza political identity proposed by
Yolanda Aguilar (2019). Ladino is a category created by colonial elites in Guatemala, that in
the 19th century became the official identity to include all non-indigenous people, as such it
aspires to Western whiteness and lifestyle (Taracena, 2019).
Historically, ladina feminists have made reflections to deconstruct, to a certain extent,
the Western feminism that influenced the women's movement in Guatemala. These
theoretical-political learnings and points of tension have mainly been around gender and
social class oppressions. (Monzón, 2015) As Aguilar (2019) remarks, ladina women have
done personal and collective reflections on mestizaje, over the last decades in the country.
The reflections on who they are and where they come from have led some to self-identify as
mestizas. However, there is still a pending discussion in terms of racism within the women’s
movement. As Aguilar proposed in her book Femestizajes (2019), the category
ladina-mestiza as a political identity offers a new horizon to critically acknowledge the racist
past and the anti-racist present of the ladina women questioning their privileges. In this
research, I aim to shed light on the question: what is the political potential of mobilizing a
new ladina-mestiza consciousness as a political identity in Guatemala?"

In addition, many also have an activist focus, where they have the additional goal of a more accepting and inclusive high school environment. This thesis is the output of a three-month field research period within high schools in the cities of Breda and Tilburg, arguing that LGBTQ+ students within high school Gender and Sexuality Alliances (GSAs) experience feeling unsafe in their school environment. In addition, this thesis shows how LGBTQ+ students navigate the unsafe school environment and how safety is embodied by different places and people. Beyond the academic world, this thesis tries to incent a debate in the Dutch education system and local governments on inclusion and exclusion within high schools, and the importance of safety, especially for minority students."

After the migrant movement came to Ijmuiden around the eighties and lived nearby and worked in Tata Steel, there has been the marginalization of the lower-class society in Wijk aan Zee regarding health. Tata Steel Ijmuiden is a Dutch multinational steel manufacturing company, hereafter named Tata Steel, which has been allowed to pollute the Ijmond for decades; just recently been brought to hold by the foundation Frisse Wind and an RIVM report (Kreling & Schoorl. Volkskrant, 2022). It is the most significant source of pollution in the Netherlands (Nos Nieuws, 2021), and with the lack of anthropological research on the social problems Tata Steel is creating by polluting the Ijmond, my thesis will contribute to addressing the debates concerning this contestation. The foundation Frisse Wind wants to represent the people’s voice of the Ijmond contested by Tata Steel’s pollution and sues them for this reason. The RIVM report helped Frisse Wind by highlighting Tata Steel’s contestation by measuring their emissions and the effect it can have on people living in the Ijmond. During my fieldwork and whilst conducting interviews, I have come across the struggle of workers of Tata Steel being economically and socially tied to work at a factory, marginalizing their health. During my fieldwork, I have followed members of Frisse Wind through the social, political, and economic debates and dilemmas within the discourse of industrial pollution.
Furthermore, I have experienced the fight for social justice within the foundation as an anthropologist and how it affects my position as a researcher. Trapped between Tata Steel and Frisse Wind, between residents and workers, I have portrayed the overall discourse of industrial pollution and how it is perceived to be affecting the health of people in the Ijmond, where I specifically found social contestation because of this in the town of Wijk aan Zee, which is why I have specified my research on this town. From the social contestation between different perspectives on the risk of health arose from this, I have found a new way of citizenship by dealing with these different contestations. This portrayal shows how the division between Tata Steel and Frisse Wind is not black and white but has multiple layers, where priorities and economic and social marginalization colour this discourse. I use the concepts of trust and risk to understand how people in the region of the IJmond perceive how the risk of Tata Steel’s pollution is contesting their health."

Vulnerability to energy poverty is not just dependent on high prices, low income, and energy-inefficient housing and appliances, but moreover on sociodemographic factors such as household composition, age, health, gender, and cultural background, and (energy-specific) poverty traps. Using the energy justice framing, this thesis shows how alleviation efforts, including the domestic energy transition, are only partly effective. While most efforts, such as a government compensation for the energy bill for poorer households and a head-started energy transition in the low-income neighborhood of Overvecht, do aim at reducing uneven distribution of energy costs and benefits, citizens are not sufficiently made part of of the procedure how these policies and efforts are made and not all needs are recognized."

This thesis explores how Dutch people who desire to remain childfree imagine and realize a good life and future. The individual accounts collected in this research show aspirations and concerns Dutch people who desire to remain childfree have regarding a good life and future. That is having the freedom and flexibility to develop and pursue the dreams they envision personally. The privileged and secure position these people are situated in enables them to realize aspirations and manage concerns about their life and future. Nevertheless, these people face stigmatizations such as selfishness, immaturity, and emotional instability in the exploration. These stigmatizations are constructed through heteronormative and pronatalist representations in popular media, advertising, healthcare, and education. These Dutch people who desire to remain childfree challenge these stigmatizations. They do this by exploring different forms of kinmaking and parenthood, such as raising children collectively instead of exclusively and establishing kinstructures based on friendship and identity instead of bloodlines. This thesis contributes to the interdependency between scholarship on voluntary childlessness and the anthropological research on the good life and anthropology of the future."

As the name reveals, participants share feelings of unheardness: they feel excluded, disregarded, and ridiculed by the mainstream, not only in politics and the media but also in their social lives. Scattered senses of belonging create a divide in society. Missing belongings are found somewhere else: Participants experience a renewed sense of home with like-minded people. Isolation combined with contemporary issues such as a general lack of meaning in lives and overall free floating fear and frustration created perfect circumstances for mass formation, an enormously radicalizing phenomenon that comprises how specific group formation influences people’s capacity to think critically and causes them to lose their individuality (Desmet 2022). In sum, the goal of this thesis is to critically examine and analyze the ways in which the (non-)belongingness of Ongehoorde Nederlanders nourishes their right-wing mass formation. To do this, this thesis is structured as follows: First, I elaborate who Ongehoorde Nederlanders are. Second, I elaborate on the sense of (non-)belonging of Ongehoorde Nederlanders. Third, I will describe how this non-belonging ensures they rise as a mass. Lastly, I conclude by advising to start including Ongehoorde Nederlanders through patient conversations."

There is increased consideration of these communities as a site of inspiration for a more sustainable mode of living from; academia, the communities themselves as they seek to further their visions, and advisory and governing bodies. Hitherto the majority of literature has taken the form and governance of intentional communities as their object of focus, namely an overt focus on why such communities tend to fail, or instructing them how they can avoid failure, by locating failure in their internal structures and governance rather than in the effects of the surrounding context.

Autonomous Mothers,"['Kooij, Loes van der']","['Marrewijk, E. van']",2022-09-14T00:01:41Z,EN,[],Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship,"Research by several gynecologists has already shown that 10 to 20 % of women found their childbirth process traumatic (Hollander & Stamrood 2017). Further research has even shown that 1 to 3% of women are even left with post-traumatic stress disorder (De Graaff et al. 2018, 649; Hollander & Stamrood 2017). In the study by Hollander and Stramrood (2017), 2200 women with traumatic childbirth experiences hardly mentioned any medical reasons for their trauma because, even though childbirth in the Netherlands is physically safer than ever, resulting in minimal maternal and infant mortality in this century, many women feel they have lost autonomy over their childbirth, which they perceive as the primary cause of their trauma. According to anthropologist Davis-Floyd (2003), over the last 300 years in the Western world, we have increasingly shifted toward a technocratic birth system in which emotion, intuition, and respect for the physiology of birth have been replaced by the assumptions that the baby develops mechanically and involuntarily in the woman's body, that the physician is in charge of the baby's proper development and growth, and that the physician will deliver the baby at the time of birth (Davis-Floyd 2003, 28). A system that provides a physically safe birth and environment for mother and child, in which lives are saved and opportunities are generated. But at the same time, this system also causes a loss of confidence in the body by the care provider and woman, which reduces the woman's autonomy during, but also before birth."

Role-Playing with Virtual Actors in an Online Communication Training: The Influence of Different Character Representations on User Experience and Learning Outcome,"['Wagensveld, Lisa']","['Nimwegen, Christof van']",2022-09-29T00:00:54Z,EN,['virtual humans; deepfakes; communication training; video role-play; user experience; learning outcome'],Human-Computer Interaction,"Effective communication is an important workplace requirement and can be improved through soft skill training programmes. A frequently used method for training interpersonal skills is through role-play. Faculty of Skills, the training agency this research is conducted for, uses video role-play in their online training programmes.
These videos are currently created by recording actors in a studio, however, this is an expensive and time-consuming process. Therefore, this research investigates whether digital alternatives (i.e., deepfakes and virtual humans) could replace actors in these videos without coming at the expense of the learning outcome
and user experience. Thus, the following research question was formulated: ”How do different character representations in a virtual communication training influence the experience and learning outcome of trainees?”.
To answer this, a between-subjects study was designed, in which participants (N = 103) were randomly assigned to either the A) actor, B) deepfake, or C) virtual human version. Participants completed a short training programme and filled out a survey afterwards. The results show that there is no significant difference in learning
outcome between the three groups. Additionally, participants did not rate the quality of the training significantly
different. The quality of the characters, however, was rated significantly lower by participants from the virtual human group. Yet this version was rated as more inventive than the other two. No significant differences where found for other components of the user experience, such as how enjoyable, interesting, or attractive the
training was. Furthermore, no significant differences were found in the feeling of engagement, presence or immersion. Finally, four video characters (2 male, 2 female) of each version were rated based on several statements. The virtual humans were generally rated worse than the other two groups. An explanation for this could be due to the less natural sounding text-to-speech (TTS) voice, or perhaps due to factors such as the length of the video or design choices regarding the appearance of the character. On the other hand, gender of the character did not seem to influence the perception. Based on the results, Faculty of Skills could potentially start tests with actual clients, in which they offer them personalised role-plays that are delivered faster
and at a lower price. This way, it can also be verified whether these results hold up after a full-length training programme as well."

The trial found no impact of BCG vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence or infection severity.  As a secondary analysis, we examined factors associated with cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection and infection severity.
Methods: Participants completed a baseline and endline questionnaire. Additionally, they completed daily/weekly diaries within a mobile phone application. Blood sample collection for SARS-CoV-2 serology testing occurred twice during follow up; serology results could distinguish natural infections from COVID-19 vaccination responses. Infections were classified as proven (by participant-reported positive test with or without seroconversion), possible (seroconverted but no participant-reported positive test), unlikely (due to inconsistent data), or unknown (due to insufficient data). The 55 participants in the latter two categories were excluded from the analyses. Furthermore, only first infection episodes were included. Infection severity was classified as: 1) no infection; 2) asymptomatic infection; 3) mild infection; and 4) moderate/severe infection. We used logistic regression to model cumulative infection and ordinal logistic regression to model infection severity. Each covariate of interest was first modelled in univariate models, followed by stepwise forward multivariable models using a cut-off of p=0.05 for retention in the model. 
Results: During follow-up, 277  infections occurred in 273 participants of 16.6% were asymptomatic, 61.0% mild, and 22.4% moderate/severe; only four participants acquired a second infection. In univariate models, taking hypertension medication, having a higher number of patient contact hours per week, having had COVID ward duty, working in internal medicine departments (compared to urgent or intensive/medium care or other hospital departments) and being female were associated with higher risks of infection as well as severe infection. In the multivariable models, the increased risk associations with hypertension medication and the work-related variables persisted. 
Conclusions: During the first year of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands, healthcare workers were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at work and their levels of risk for both infection acquisition as well as infection severity were associated with work-related conditions."

The research investigates three questions: 1) Do the teachers of the ‘Cattaneo-Deledda’ school believe that 21st century skills should be an important part of the school curriculum? Why/ why not?; 2) In what way(s) do the ‘Cattaneo-Deledda’ teachers believe 21st century skills should be integrated in student learning? To what extent do they believe in the importance of each proposed change? ; 3) Would the ‘Cattaneo-Deledda’ teachers be willing to integrate such changes in their teaching? Why/why not? 
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven of the schools’ teachers. All interviews happened in Italian and were thematically coded according to the ideas reported within the ‘P21 21st Century Learning Framework’. The study’s relevance lies in digging into teachers’ opinions, rather than practices. Teacher beliefs may clarify where the Italian education system is lacking and which policies can be designed for change to occur. The results showed that the teachers are in favour of teaching 21st century skills and practices, and that their beliefs mostly match the ideas encompassed in the P21 framework."

Health Service has started to invite companies into the system to try and tackle these problems, for 
example by providing digital health solutions. This privatisation is often viewed by the public as a 
threat to free healthcare, but also brings significant opportunities. Digital health is suggested to 
streamline healthcare processes, lower the pressure on healthcare professionals, and provide easy 
access for healthcare consumers. In its development, the digital health market is facing challenges 
that need to be overcome to serve its part in healthcare. Taking the case of digital health primary 
care platforms in Greater Manchester, this research focused on what barriers market actors 
experience while forming the market and proposes policy trade-offs to tackle these.
Frameworks of Boon et al. (2022) and Flanagan et al. (2022) were used to specify the digital health 
market formation processes and regional industrial policy trade-offs. A Historical Event Analysis 
(HEA) and interviews were used to gather and analyse data. The HEA clarified the context of the 
research by connecting events from 2012 to 2022 to market formation indicators and aimed to show 
an either inhibiting or facilitating function to the process. Interviews were conducted with an 
interview guide derived from the HEA narrative and aimed to validate and add to the narrative while 
also exploring the factors that influence developments in the digital health market in relation to the 
isolated events. 
The HEA and interview outcomes led to the following barriers: SME and multinational market entry 
inhibition by strict and changing regulation, expensive and time-consuming evidence gathering value 
proposition for gaining legitimacy, healthcare digitalisation causes health inequalities to worsen, lack
of integration into GPs’ workflow and IT systems as a barrier of adoption, healthcare digitalisation 
causes health inequalities to worsen, and data usage by companies is ambiguous to the consumer.
As of the upcoming implementation of Integrated Care Systems, local actors will increasingly gain 
legitimacy to exert influence on their region through decision-making in healthcare. This research 
suggests shifting the attention in policy to a narrower framing of the problem, a more diverse network 
and customization of the institutions to the actors in digital healthcare."
Mass Hierarchies and Scaling Scenarios for Perturbatively Flat Flux Vacua,"['Rottier, Maarten']","['Gursoy, U']",2022-09-30T00:00:32Z,EN,['Moduli stabilization; fluxes; super potential'],Theoretical Physics,"Within the setting type IIB string theory compactifications on a Calabi-Yau orientifold, we systematically analyze the scaling behavior of the superpotential W0 and the moduli masses with respect to the flux-induced tadpole charge Nflux. We do this for a set of explicit geometries in the large complex structure regime. In particular, we use a recipe proposed by Demirtas, Kim, McAllister, and Moritz (DKMM) in combination with a recent statistical analysis of Carta, Mininno, and Shukla (CMS) to solve the F -term equations for this set of geometries. We will go beyond the effective approach taken in this recipe, allowing us to explicitly compute the masses of the moduli. We furthermore stabilize a single Kähler modulus utilizing the KKLT- recipe. For all models investigated by CMS, we find that the bounding region of the distribution of W0 with respect to Nflux can be described by an exponential scaling. Furthermore, we find that the mass of the lightest modulus scales as a power law with respect to W0, indicating that smaller values of W0 give rise to lighter moduli. The most interesting finding is that the mass scale of the heaviest modulus competes with, or drastically exceeds, the Kaluza-Klein scale of the compactification for all of these models. We consequently compute the scaling of the ratio between the heaviest modulus and the Kaluza-Klein scale with respect to Nflux, indicating that these models need unrealistically large flux numbers in order to give a correct mass hierarchy. We extend the analysis to a handful of models with three complex structure moduli, one of which admits a flux vacuum with a correct mass hierarchy."

They have a positive influence on the ecosystem and the well-being of local citizens. This is widely recognizable now with the United Nations (UN) mentioning public urban green spaces accessibility in their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). To make the most of PUGSs, create them, and manage them sustainably we need to understand them and their spatial and temporal characteristics better. There is also a need for more accessible and cheaper PUGSs datasets so that officials and locals can use that in designing more sustainable neighbourhoods and cities. While spatial PUGSs data for some cities are available in land use dataset, these are often inaccessible to outside researchers, and not updated frequently. Hence there are methodological limitations on how PUGS can be created more efficiently for a wider usage. Deep learning methods with the usage of satellite images are a great way to achieve that because they can capture geometric patterns of land cover types using freely available satellite images of moderate spatial and temporal resolution. This study evaluates two convolutional network architectures, U-Net and U-Net with a ResNet-34 encoder, for semantic segmentation of PUGSs at a metropolitan level from multiple cities worldwide. Open-source data, mainly Sentinel and ground truth data about PUGSs from various open data portals are used as an input data. The chosen best model had an average test Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0,5610, and average test F1 score of 0,64515 across two external cities, which is a moderate to good performance of the deep learning model in detecting PUGSs. It shows that this approach is promising to create reliable, new PUGSs datasets that can help officials in urban planning."

This battalion of volunteers served under United States command and were part of some of the most crucial battles during the war.
Existing literature reveals that the Dutch government was not a willing participant of the Korean War, but were persuaded by the United States because of its political pressure. The Korean War came at an inopportune moment for the Netherlands because they were rebuilding its nation after the Second World War and had just lost the majority of the Netherlands East Indie. The limited existing literature state describe the course of the Netherlands in Korea and show that the government withdrew its attention to the conflict almost immediately after entering the war in 1950. Nevertheless, the war lasted 2 more years and Dutch troops stayed in Korea until December 1954 where they worked closely with the United States under the flag of the United Nations.
These previous studies have looked at the actions of the Dutch government in a descriptive manner. They have failed to analyze these decisions critically or academically. As a result, this study has drawn from these descriptive studies and has analyzed the foreign policy of the Netherlands in regard to the Korean War through the lenses of multilateralism and allyship with a focus on the Dutch-American alliance specifically as this relationship has shown to be to most influential in regard to the Dutch government’s decisions during the Korean War. Additionally, small-state theory has been applied to look at the Netherlands’ position in international politics and whether the relationship between a large state, the United States, and a small-state, the Netherlands, has been affected by the Netherlands’ position.
During this study, the following research question was analyzed ‘How was the Netherlands influenced internally and externally in its foreign policy regarding the Korean War and the deployment of the NDVN’? Dutch policy regarding the Korean War was influenced by several aspects. The Netherlands was undergoing a change in foreign policy from an independent and neutral policy to one that was influenced by Atlanticism and focused more on alliances. Although these alliances, especially the Dutch government-American alliance, were at the center of foreign politics for the Dutch government, the Netherlands had a complicated relationship with the United States. While the Netherlands did confront the United States several times regarding its Korean War policy, Dutch diplomats were generally a loyal ally within United Nations and NATO context. This is partly due to the position of the Netherlands as a small state that felt the need to side with bigger states such as the United States. In regard to the Korean War, the Dutch government cabinet did not prioritize its participation and sacrificed the welfare of its troops because of the lack of attention from the government after the NDVN’s initial deployment. The Dutch government focused more on issues closer to home such as the development of NATO and the unresolved issue of Netherlands New Guinea instead."
Ecological Impressionism: Envisioning a New Framework of Ecological Aesthetic Politics,"['Cate, David ten']","['Raessens, J.F.F.']",2022-10-06T00:01:01Z,EN,[],"Media, Art and Performance studies","In times of climate crisis, the question of reimagining society ecologically is more
urgent than ever. The response to the ecological crisis remains inadequate, and
global climate change mitigation goals are increasingly considered unrealistic. To
break through the limitations of contemporary politics to tackle the crisis, this
thesis considers an ecological aesthetic politics – that is to say, an aesthetically
conceived framework for reimagining politics ecologically. In order to do so, this
thesis discusses what Jacques Rancière calls the sensible, that which can be
perceived and thought in a particular configuration of reality. In contemporary
western society, this sensibility falls short in perceiving and thinking a way out of
ecological disequilibrium. Therefore, it must be reimagined, for which aesthetic
politics provide fecund ground. In this thesis, as it is situated in media studies, such
an aesthetic-political imaginary is first historically traced, and then adapted to
contemporary medial forms. It is argued that an ecological sensibility can be
negotiated when medial forms go through an aesthetic-political transformation. 

Historically, this transition is identified in the art movement of Impressionism.
The Impressionists changed academic painting by leaving the studio for the
outdoors, dismantling the stability of perception and blending it with natural
inspiration. This transformation was taken a step further by the literary
impressionists, who conceived of the nonhuman objects of human perception as
having a subjectivity of their own. With this precedent, this thesis examines
contemporary media of animation film and videogames to bolster contemporary
understandings of an ecological aesthetic politics based on shared principles of
instable perception and nonhuman subjectivity. Their interpretations exemplify
how animation film is continuous with Impressionism’s strategies of pictorial
redefinition, and also envision how such a framework would prospectively apply
in the medium of videogames, by constructing an ecological aesthetic politics
model from the ground up. Because of the origin of the principles of ecological
aesthetic politics, this framework may be referred to as ecological impressionism."
Diamond in the Rough: Een culturele biografie van het oorlogsmonument in Derry/Londonderry,"['Rem, Janneke']","['Plets, G.F.J.']",2022-10-06T00:01:06Z,NL,['Noord-Ierland; erfgoed; Eerste Wereldoorlog; oorlogsherdenkingen; monumenten; nationalisme en unionisme'],Cultural History of Modern Europe,"In Noord-Ierland is al honderden jaren spanning tussen de protestantse unionisten en de katholieke nationalisten. Deze strijd lijkt op het eerste gezicht vooral gebaseerd op religieuze en politieke overtuigingen. Pogingen om beide groepen nader tot elkaar te brengen werken maar tot een zekere hoogte, en onder de oppervlakte blijven de spanningen aanwezig. Deze scriptie gaat verder dan de politieke en religieuze verschillen en onderzoekt juist hoe de cultureel-historische dimensie, en dan met name erfgoed, heeft bijgedragen aan het conflict. Door een culturele biografie op te stellen van het Diamond War Memorial vanaf haar oprichting tot aan het uitbreken van de Troubles wordt getracht de relatie tussen de verschillende bevolkingsgroepen en het monument te analyseren en te ontdekken hoe het monument heeft bijgedragen aan de verdere verdeling van de bevolkingsgroepen.

Door middel van een discours analyse op kranten en archiefstukken wordt een beeld geschetst van het monument en de manier waarop deze werd ontvangen en gebruikt gedurende haar bestaan. Hieruit wordt duidelijk dat het monument een belangrijk onderdeel van algemene herdenkingen raakt, namelijk oorlogsherdenkingen. Deze waren in Noord-Ierland vaak protestant unionistisch van aard, en werden verbonden met het monument. Daarnaast laat het onderzoek zien dat het monument werd gebruikt in verschillende protestant unionistische herdenkingen van sektarische gebeurtenissen uit de geschiedenis. Hierdoor werd het meer en meer een representatie van de protestant unionistische herinnering. De katholieke nationalisten herdachten belangrijke gebeurtenissen in hun geschiedenis op een andere manier, waarbij het monument minder voorkwam in de plechtigheden. Het monument werd dus in de jaren tussen haar oprichting en het uitbreken van de Troubles een overwegend protestant unionistisch symbool."
Possible Ethical and Social Implications of Artificial Uterus for the Right to Abortion. A perspective of Feminist Bioethics.,"['Brambilla, Giulia']","['White, Lucie']",2022-10-06T00:00:59Z,EN,['Abortion; Feminist Bioethics; Ectogestation; Ectogenesis; Artificial Uterus; Artificial Womb; Feminism; Bioethics; Right to abortion;'],Philosophy,"The researchers predict that within five years it will be possible to use the artificial
uterus and the partial ectogenesis process on human fetuses. In light of this
consideration, it is necessary to develop a feminist bioethical debate capable of
analyzing the possible implications, not only ethical, but also social, to which this
new technology could lead us. In particular, it is necessary to analyze what could be
the implications that the artificial uterus could have on the right to voluntary
termination of pregnancy.
In this thesis I will first deal with the systematic review of the stages that led to the
development of the artificial uterus and then specifically analyze the relationship of
the latter with the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy. In this regard, I
support the thesis that, although the artificial uterus can represent an important
opportunity from the point of view of medical progress, it is still necessary to place
important limitations on its use in order to protect and defend the right to
abortion."
Noise from stochastically excited structures: Modelling the noise from marine propellers excited by a turbulent boundary layer,"['Berg, Ravi de']","['Capel, P.J.S. van']",2022-10-06T00:00:58Z,EN,"['Vibrations, stochastic excitation, turbulent boundary layer']",Experimental Physics,"People do not always realise sound is of great importance underwater. Marine life is
strongly affected by underwater noise. The source of underwater noise this work focusses
on is that of non-cavitating marine propellers. This noise is caused by pressure fluctuations
on the propeller, which arise because of the turbulent inflow generated by the ship
wakefield and hull, and the turbulent boundary layer on the blade. These fluctuations
are so complicated, that they are basically random but with known statistical properties.
Therefore, we need a stochastic approach to calculate the radiated noise. We need to first
calculate the response to this stochastic excitation and consequently the radiated noise.
To this end, we first show that we can calculate the response of a multi-degree-offreedom system under stochastic excitation. We demonstrate that we can calculate the
response of proportionally damped linear systems through a modal approach. A modal
approach is a valid approach, because the resonances of a system dominate the response.
Apart from this, we also show that we can calculate the response through modal analysis
for non-proportionally damped systems. This approach uses state-space to allow for modal
analysis.
These multi-degree-of-freedom systems are the basis of further calculations on real
geometries. The finite element method is employed to calculate the response of systems
with arbitrary geometries. A finite element system behaves largely in the same way as a
multi-degree-of-freedom system. We show that we can calculate the response of both the
proportionally and non-proportionally damped systems. These calculations are verified
for very simple systems by using analytical computations. One limitation of the nonproportional finite element method is that a point loading seems to give deviating results
for COMSOL Multiphysics and our state-space approach. However, this is not a large
limitation, as real world applications mostly use surface loads. Also, this difference does
not arise for proportionally damped systems.
Finally, to calculate the radiated noise of a system, we show that we can use structuralacoustic coupled systems. A modal analysis using the state-space approach, allows us to
calculate the response of the structure, and the pressure response in the fluid. Integrating
the cross-spectra of these responses at the interface gives the radiated sound intensity
spectrum. It turns out however, that the resulting pressure and structural response are not
the same for our calculations and the one done by COMSOL Multiphysics. Especially for
high density fluids (such as water), the results deviate significantly.
Further research into this topic should focus on finding an explanation for this
difference, for example by using an open-source software package to calculate system
matrices, or by finding the system matrices of a simple system by oneself, using the (semianalytical) expressions for a simple system. Experimentally verifying the results would
bring this part of the research to a close. Additionally, more research on characterising the
pressure spectrum caused by the inflow turbulence and turbulent boundary layer on a
marine propeller would make the calculations relevant for real-world applications."

Since many Middle Eastern migrants and refugees were neglected in the woods by Belarussian and Polish authorities, their rights were violated. However, the EU did not interfere, even though the institution is internationally obligated to comply with the safeguarding of the human rights of migrants and refugees. This shows one of the many contradictions that are a part of the EU’s ontology. This thesis analyses the history of the contradictions and violations that have taken place in the field of human rights of migrants and refugees. In addition to this, this thesis leads you through the pathways of the EU-Belarus conflict, by showing more contradictions in the EU’s attitude towards human rights in general and finally, this thesis argues that the EU’s goal in the EU-Belarus border crisis is to defeat Lukashenko rather than save people’s lives."
Screening Homonormativity and Queer Resistance: Irish LGBTQ Community Responses to Mainstream Film and Television Representation,"['Cremin, Sarah']","['Dupont, Wannes']",2022-10-06T00:01:03Z,EN,['LGBT; LGBTQ; queer; film; television; Ireland; visibility; representation; homonormativity; screen media;'],Cultural History of Modern Europe,"Visibility in media and society has been a central concern for Western LGBTQ activists for many decades. Seeing LGBTQ people on screen has frequently been positioned as an essential tool to force mainstream, heteronormative society to recognise LGBTQ experiences, and to allow isolated LGBTQ people to connect to a community and form their queer identity. These ideas shaped discourse about media in the 2000s, a period which saw the rise and commercialisation of overt LGBTQ visibility in mainstream film and television. While much of this media representation has been explored in depth in literary and media studies, there have been far fewer audience reception studies which attempt to understand the complex and diverse ways in which LGBTQ people decode the media they consume. This thesis highlights audience perspectives by taking the Irish LGBTQ community periodical Gay Community News (GCN) as a case study. It analyses its editorial and reader-submitted content relating to LGBTQ representation in screen media, placing these discussions within the context of changes in Irish society. Through this, it highlights the persistent homonormativity which was present in discourse about visibility across this period, along with the tension within the LGBTQ community between politics of assimilation and liberation."

A research to the differences in obtaining future cultural, social and economic capital through education between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.","['Hoogstraten, Ruben van']","['Hoogenboom, Marcel']",2022-10-18T15:00:36Z,EN,"['Social capital, economic capital, cultural capital, educatoin, socioeconomic status, students']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Introduction: Education stimulates social mobility from students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. In contemporary society, due to social policies, people are given the opportunity to follow an education, which is less determined by someone’s socioeconomic background. As a result, more and more people are highly educated, leading into an opportunity trap (Fishman, Ludgate & Tutak, 2017). As a consequence, it remains unanswered whether education is a means of stimulating social mobility. In this study, the contribution of education on the change of someone’s socioeconomic status (SES) will be examined. Bourdieu’s concepts of capital (i.e., cultural, social and economic) will be used as an indication of SES. Resulting in the following question: To what extent does education contribute to the differences in obtaining future cultural, social and economic capital?  Methods: The data used for this study comes from the LISS panel and the sample for this study consisted of 261 participants. A quantitative research method is used to analyse the data. Results: It is indicated that education does not show an interaction effect on the relationship of relative change from someone’s starting capital towards someone’s ending capital. Starting capital, however, does show a significant result in the relative increase of that capital. Discussion: Although, no effects of education on capital change were found, this study did show that your starting capital is an important factor in capital development. It appears that when you start with relatively more capital, you also end up with relatively more capital compared to others. This research has shown that there are mutual differences in the possession of capital and that these differences continue to exist later on. This applies for social and economic capital, but not for cultural capital."
"To what extent do the perceived barriers of availability, affordability and quality of fruit and vegetables explain socioeconomic inequalities in fruit and vegetable consumption among adults in The Netherlands","['Kelly, Caoimhe']","['Kamphuis, Carlijn']",2022-10-18T15:00:40Z,EN,"['Socioeconomic position, diet inequity, perception, fruit, vegetables, the Netherlands, consumption, affordability, availability, quality']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Consumption of fruit and vegetables has been shown to be below recommended intake levels among adults in the Netherlands, acting as a risk factor for health. Countries such as the UK and USA show there is an association between Socioeconomic Position (SEP) and fruit and vegetable consumption, whereby lower fruit and vegetable intake is often associated with socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. However, there has been little empirical research to whether there are differential views surrounding affordability, availability, and quality of produce between groups differing in socioeconomic characteristics in The Netherlands. The present study investigates to what extent perceived barriers of availability, affordability, and quality (AAQ) of fruit and vegetables explain socioeconomic inequalities in fruit and vegetable consumption using the 2004 Dutch GLOBE study. Linear regression analysis was carried out to test whether household income was a predictor of fruit and vegetable consumption as suggested by previous research. This was followed by a mediation analysis examining whether the relationship between SEP (household income) and fruit and vegetable consumption were mediated by the perceptions of AAQ of fruit and vegetables. There was no significant relationship between household income in fruit and vegetable consumption. Results indicated that the relationship between household income and perceived barriers of AAQ of vegetables was significant. Fruit and vegetable consumption was not mediated by the perceptions of AAQ of fruit and vegetables. Therefore, it is likely individuals do not differ in their perceived views in relation to affording, accessing and obtaining high quality fruit and vegetables regardless of SEP. This study did not find that individuals with high, middle, or low incomes differed in their fruit and vegetable consumption among adults in The Netherlands."

because they are marginalised and insufficiently researched. The urgency presents itself because
worldwide 19-40% of female sex workers initiate selling sex underage, meanwhile 80% of the 
worlds HIV positive women are in Sub-Saharan Africa during regional a youth bulge. The review 
analysed the experiences of YWSS, particularly how their social institutional environment affects
their health, because environments influence wellbeing. The mixed methods SPIDER analysis 
used identified 18 articles representing 17 sub-Saharan African countries. Results depict social 
institutional environments that fail to acknowledge or respond to YWSS’s vulnerabilities and 
marginalisation leading to poor health. YWSS experience social and institutional barriers to 
accessing general health and legal services, usually in the form of harassment or policies 
preventing access. YWSS also lack services tailored specifically for youth to access independently,
especially minors. This support deficiency increases risks of experiencing violence, poor mental
and physical health such as mood disorders, STIs, and HIV. Due to the unforgiving environment,
YWSS hide their occupation to stay safe, and seek alternative venues for support such as traditional 
healers for health and gangs for protection from violence which can be dangerous and exploitative.
In conclusion, more research needs to be done on YWSS in sub-Saharan Africa because the
understanding of their experiences is limited, especially for minors. Policies on sex work and how 
to treat minors who sell sex need to be revised with the intent to decriminalise sex work, and ensure
that health and legal services are available, accessible, and age appropriate for all YWSS, even 
minors."
Negative Birth Experiences (NBEs) in the Netherlands: A qualitative content analysis on the driving factors of NBEs from the #breakthesilence social media campaign,"['Giron, Nikita']","['Bal, Michèlle']",2022-10-18T14:00:31Z,,"['Negative birth experiences, Women, interpersonal factors, systemtic factors']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Introduction: Recently there has been increasing awareness on negative birth experiences (NBEs) that occur among women in the Netherlands. The Dutch social media campaign, #genoeggezwegen (#breakthesilence), shared the stories of these women who endured such negative and traumatic birth experiences. This study aimed to identify the driving factors of NBEs in the Netherlands by analysing the stories shared by the #GG campaign, in order to better understand why NBEs occur in the first place. Methods: A qualitative content analysis study was conducted using an existing dataset of #GG stories collected from the 2016 campaign and produced by van der Pijl et al (2020). Stories were analysed through a deductive and inductive coding procedure using Bohren et al’s work on the mistreatment of women during birth and the WHO framework on improving maternal care.  Results: 416 stories were included for analysis. Themes that were identified were: health system conditions and constraints; power dynamics between the care provider and client; poor communication; lack of professionalism; culture surrounding natural childbirth; lack of emotional support; discrimination; and misinterpretation of interaction between the care provider and the client. Managing expectations was identified as an overarching theme.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates how several factors can interplay and influence a woman’s experience of birth. Such factors can be at the interpersonal level, in which clients may need to manage expectations better and care providers provide better care. These determinants, however, are accompanied by and may also be influenced by systemic/institutional level factors, implying that there are changes to be made at a structural level to prevent NBEs."
Insight into what role in-group favouritism and out-group degrading play among the anti-vaccination discourse,"['Ismail, Hafsa']","['Stok, Marijn']",2022-10-18T15:00:38Z,EN,['Twitter; In-group favouritism; Out-group degrading; Content codes; Anti-vaccination discourse'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Background: By providing insight into the different types of arguments used by anti-vaccination proponents on Twitter, this study aims to contribute towards the development of an effective method that also considers the anti-vaccination discourse.  Insights from the Social Identity Theory and the Identity Based Motivation Theory were used as theoretical lenses to understand the role of in-group favouritism and out-group degrading within the anti-vaccination discourse. 
Methods:  The analysis of this research was based on an iterative process. A total of 2000 tweets were randomly selected out of 85000 tweets for further manual coding. Once the 2000 tweets were categorised and analysed for content, all the anti-tweets were selected for further analysis. This subset contained 58 tweets which were categorised under eleven different content codes.
Results: This study showed that the in-group members, who refer to those against vaccinations will degrade the out-group members as a way of enhancing the in-group. Almost half of all anti-tweets contained out-group degrading (48%). In addition to this the in-group favours their group-members and regard their in-group highly. However, they are not present in large numbers (19%). This study also showed that different types of arguments are used by anti-vaccination proponents and there are differences in the type of arguments and the use of in-group favouritism and out-group degrading.
Conclusions: Only a small body of work has examined whether Social Identity Theory and the Identity Based Motivation Theory are implicated in anti-vaccination tweets on Twitter and to what extent they play a role. Therefore, it is extremely important to conduct further research to develop an effective method that incorporates the anti-vaccination discourse."

Methods: The data used for this study comes from the longitudinal DiYo project. The sample for this study consisted of 1,886 participants. The data obtained were analyzed through a quantitative research method. Results: Duration of Instagram and Snapchat use was found to be a significant negative predictor on adolescent boys' thoughts about their bodies. Furthermore, duration of Instagram and Snapchat use was not found to be a significant predictor of how adolescent boys felt about their bodies. Additionally, adolescent boys' thoughts and feelings about body image were found to be significantly related. Finally, regardless of whether you are an adolescent boy, or an adolescent girl was found to have an impact on the relationship between the duration of Instagram and Snapchat use and how adolescents think and feel about their bodies. Conclusion: The influence of using Snapchat and Instagram is negative, but weak, when it comes to adolescent boys' body image. Given the weak influence, in further research it would be interesting to see what other external factors can influence a negative body image of adolescent boys. Regardless of whether you are an adolescent boy or girl, the relationship between the use of Snapchat and Instagram and the body image of adolescent boys and girls remains weak. Based on this weak relationship, further research is recommended."

fairness, also known as individualizing moral foundations. Regression models and multiple 
mediation models were used to investigate whether this interaction holds true in a non-US 
context, namely the Netherlands. The results supported the predicted mediating role of 
individualizing moral foundations, with no mediating effects of the binding moral foundations of 
loyalty, authority and purity, in the relationship between political ideology and 
environmentalism. These results indicate that right-wing individuals endorse less in 
environmentalism due to lower concerns for individualizing moral values compared to left-wing 
individuals. These findings confirm the important role of moral values in addressing 
environmentalism to mitigate climate change."
The Effect of Income on Sustainable Food Choices,"['Berg, Goos van den']","['Kamphuis, Carlijn']",2022-10-18T13:00:49Z,EN,"['sustainable food consumption, income']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Background: Income influences the consumption of sustainable food, but this may differ per type of sustainable food. The current study distinguishes two types of sustainable food consumption: sustainable food choices that save money and sustainable food choices that are expensive. The theory of planned behavior is used to explain how income groups differ in their purchasing of sustainable food that is expensive, by taking importance of food price into account as a potential mediating factor. The scarcity theory is used to explain how income groups differ in their purchasing of sustainable food that saves money, by taking financial scarcity into account as potential mediating factor.
Methods: Data from a correlational survey was used. A nationwide sample of 1055 respondents living across the Netherlands completed the survey. Respondents reported demographic factors, their income, whether they experienced financial scarcity, if they found the price of food important and their sustainable food purchasing. PROCESS v3.0 by Hayes was used to do a mediation analysis.  
Results: There was no significant relation between income and purchasing sustainable food that saves money. Neither, did income have a significant relation with purchasing sustainable food that is expensive. Financial scarcity was not found to have a mediating role between income and making sustainable food choices that save money. Importance of food price did have a significant role as a mediator between income and purchasing sustainable food that is expensive.
Conclusions: Income does not have an effect on sustainable food consumption. However, the importance individuals place on the price of food does have a mediating effect on the relation between income and expensive sustainable food. Future research could examine other explanatory factors for sustainable food consumption and might focus on a different way of measuring sustainable food consumption."

Furthermore, scientific arguments are most prominent in the pro-vaccination Tweets as opposed to the anti-vaccination and hesitant Tweets. In the anti-vaccination Tweets, the importance of doing research yourself is highlighted and posters express a lack of trust in science. In the hesitant Tweets, the importance of good information provision is seen as important."

Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) and for the person close to them: their significant other. This could have 
long-term impacts, such as psychological distress. The current study investigates if social support and 
physical independence of persons with SCI/ABI and their significant others (dyad) predict their life 
satisfaction six months after inpatient discharge. 
Research question: Does perceived social support of the person with SCI/ABI and their significant other 
and physical independence of the person with SCI/ABI measured shortly after the start of inpatient 
rehabilitation, predict life satisfaction of both persons in a dyad six months after inpatient rehabilitation?
Method: Data were used from the POWER-study, a prospective quantitative longitudinal study conducted 
in 12 rehabilitation centres in the Netherlands among dyads between 2016 and 2018. Persons with 
SCI/ABI and their significant others filled in self-reported questionnaires separately at the start of 
inpatient rehabilitation and six months after inpatient discharge.154 dyads were included. Data were 
analysed using SPSS with independent t-tests, Pearson’s chi-squared tests, Pearson correlations and
MANCOVA. 
Results: Dyads of the SCI-group scored lower on life satisfaction then dyads of the ABI-group. Life 
satisfaction of persons with SCI/ABI were correlated with life satisfaction of significant others. Perceived 
social support of the person with SCI/ABI and their significant others are not related to their life
satisfaction. Physical independence is a predictor for the life satisfaction of the dyad.
Conclusion: The relationship of life satisfaction between the dyad indicates that dyadic health should be 
considered. Therefore, significant others should be included to a greater extent in the rehabilitation and 
predictors such as physical independence can serve as risk screening during rehabilitation."

The literature on homelessness prevention in the Netherlands did not report on how the country's four largest municipalities (i.e., Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht) counteracted such access barriers, to support vulnerable EU-LM, during the period 2016-2019. Therefore, this thesis aimed to research the municipal actions developed by these municipalities to prevent their EU-LM from becoming homeless, between 2016 and 2019. To do so, four case studies were conducted, corresponding to each of these municipalities. For each one, was performed a document analysis of policy papers that accounted for the municipal actions implemented to prevent the risk of EU-LM homelessness. The analyses were developed in relation to Gaetz & Dej's (2017) theoretical model of the causes and prevention of homelessness. As a result, 6 municipal actions were identified in Amsterdam, 4 in Rotterdam, 12 in The Hague, and 5 in Utrecht, which demonstrated different governmental strategies to counteract the structural, system, and individual and relational leading factors of EU-LM homelessness. The comparison of the case studies showed that the municipality of The Hague prevented the three leading factors of EU-LM homelessness, continuously during the research period. This thesis produced new knowledge on the history of EU-LM homeless prevention in the Netherlands considering Gaetz & Dej's (2017) theoretical model and helped to establish the basis for future research on the field."

Through content analysis of key legal and policy documents and conducting semi-structured interviews with professionals involved in supporting asylum seekers, this research analyses how those with symptoms of PTSD are accounted for by the Immigration en Naturalisatiedienst (IND), Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and healthcare professionals during their asylum procedure in the Netherlands. Academically, this study aims to take an innovative stance on exploring asylum seekers’ support throughout their procedure whilst experiencing trauma, by utilising data triangulation in combination with Fassin’s (2013) and Legido-Quigley et al’s (2019) theoretical frameworks. This will provide an in-depth, interdisciplinary insight into how the current system can be improved in order to better account for the challenges introduced by PTSD symptoms, thus providing enhanced support for asylum seekers throughout their procedure. The findings demonstrate that whilst there exists legislation and policy with which to guide support for those with PTSD, in practice this is hindered by structural constraints and differing approaches by the IND, NGOs and healthcare professionals. This results in significant power imbalances between professionals and asylum seekers, as well as amongst professionals. For future practice to reform, an individualised asylum procedure, stronger multilateral communication and training is needed in order to be able to better support traumatised asylum seekers through an extremely turbulent period."

Many of these measures however are mandatory but left unchecked, leaving it up to people to decide whether or not to comply to these measures. One of these measures is COVID-19 related self-isolation. When a person has contracted covid, they are supposed to stay at home. In the current study factors are discussed which influence compliance to such a measure. Using different levels of influence (individual, social and structural) and the theoretical domains framework a set of factors was found to possibly explain compliance behavior. Individual  factors included in the model were gender(women comply more than men), age(The older the more compliant, up until 60+ when people become less compliant), educational level(The higher educated the more compliant), perceptions about health(The more negative perceptions, the more compliant) and worries about employment (The less worries the more compliant). Social factors were perceived social isolation (the more isolated the less compliant). Structural factors were beliefs about the current measures to mitigate the spread of covid (The more positive the more compliant). Using a logistical regression on the binary dependent variable did or did not break their COVID-19 related self-isolation compliance was predicted using the former variables. Results indicate age, gender, educational level and perceptions about health are significant predictors of compliance. Self-isolation was not. Beliefs about regulations and worries about employment had to be omitted due to concerns with the assumptions of a logistical regression. Gender, age and perceptions about health followed the hypothesized effect. Educational level did not. Explanations for this are given in the discussion, together with limitations, strengths and avenues for further research."

However, nowadays, people living with HIV (PLHIV) can live as long as someone without HIV due to medication. The virus is treatable, but researchers are still looking for a cure for PLHIV. At the same time, little research has been done on what PLHIV consider a cure and, more importantly, whether they want to be cured. Objective: This research aims to determine what PLHIV’s views are about an HIV cure. Methods: Twelve PLHIV were recruited in April-May 2021 through the Dutch HIV Association and HIV counselor(s). Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted. This study uses thematic analysis to analyze the interviews. Results: Thematic analyses revealed three levels of central themes and several sub-themes which reflect the conception of PLHIV: (i) views of PLHIV about a cure; (ii) reasons for a cure (stigma, changes in their lives, and side effects); (iii) concerns about an HIV cure for PLHIV in The Netherlands. Conclusions: This study concluded that PLHIV suggests that PLHIV want to be cured because they would experience less stigma and fewer side effects of medication. Therefore their quality of life (QoL) will increase. Furthermore, a sterilizing cure is considered a cure. However, PLHIV have concerns about the cure procedure, and they have doubts about their personal health level, and the process of an HIV cure will affect their health."
"Carsharing, a solution for transport poverty: A research on the B2C carsharing market in the four largest cities in the Netherlands","['Ophoff, Robert']","['Wit, John de']",2022-10-24T13:00:48Z,EN,"['Carsharing, mobility, transport poverty']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Recently carsharing has become perceived as an option to make cities more livable. Carsharing is a new mobility option benefitting users in different ways. Carsharing can offer a solution for individuals at risk of not being able to reach destinations, which hinders participation in society, also known as transport poverty. However, previous studies have shown that carsharing is being embraced by people who are already mobile. This study investigates how shared cars are distributed across Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht and how this distribution is related to demographic factors. This study also tests how mobility policy is related to the link between shared mobility and transport poverty. The study is done on the basis of CBS data at neighbourhood level and the number of shared cars offered by platforms. By linking these different data, it became clear what the relationship is between demographic and geographical variables on the one hand and the number of shared cars on the other.						This study concludes that the number of shared cars in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht is related to the income of a neighbourhood. People in neighbourhoods with a higher income and employment rate have more shared cars at their disposal. This means that people with an increased risk of transport poverty have fewer shared cars at their disposal. And although Rotterdam and The Hague indicate that they want to use shared mobility against transport poverty, these two cities do not differ in their distribution compared to Amsterdam and Utrecht."
Family-work conflict and its implication for job performance in the Dutch health care sector,"['Marsen, Linda']","['Wit, John de']",2022-10-24T13:00:46Z,EN,"['Health care workers, job performance, health care sector, family-work conflict']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Background: Labor shortage among Dutch health care workers is a current issue, of which a main 
indicator is decreasing job performance. Existing research has proven that work characteristics 
are predictors of job performance, but family-work conflict as an indicator has scarcely been researched, especially among health care workers. This thesis therefore aims to explore the possibility of a causal relation between family-work conflict and health care workers’ job performance. 
Methods: By using data from the Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences [LISS] panel, 
health care workers were selected (N = 670), and regression analyses were performed to examine 
a causal relation between family or job characteristics and job performance while controlling for 
health as a mediator. 
Results: Family characteristics hardly predict job performance, except for care for children as an 
individual predictor. Job characteristics predict job performance, while health does not function 
as a mediator. 
Conclusions: Additional research on the subject of family-work conflict in relation to job performance among health care workers is advocated. It is hereby proposed to involve behavioral and 
cognitive aspects as predictors. It is also recommended for research institutions to support interdisciplinary research on the subject to gain an integral view on the matter"
The effect of educational level on ethnic differences in labor market position in the Netherlands,"['Haak, Anouk']","['Wit, John de']",2022-10-24T13:00:40Z,EN,"['labor market position, minority groups, educational level, discrimination']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Aim. The aim of this research was to increase the knowledge of the effect of educational level on the differences between ethnic minority groups and native Dutch in labor market position. Discrimination could partially explain these differences, and the statistical discrimination theory indicates that the effect of educational level differs on the ground of ethnical background. This study examined the extent to which the differences in labor market position occur between ethnic minority groups in the Netherlands and native Dutch, examined whether educational level as an effect on this relation, and examined whether those differences decrease when educational level increases.
Methods. Two binary logistic regression analyses with moderation were used to examine this effect. Labor market position is measured with probability of being unemployed and probability to have a temporary contract in comparison with a permanent contract. 
Results. Results show, as expected, that people with a Moroccan, Turkish, Surinamese or Antillean background are more likely to be unemployed. Besides, when employed, minority groups, with the exception of people with a Surinamese background, are more likely to have a temporary employment contract. However, this study has found no significant effect of employment level on this relation.
Conclusion. As the effect of educational level on labor market outcomes does not differ between ethnic minority groups and native Dutch, this study could not state that the disadvantaged position of minority groups decreases when educational level increases. Further research is required to examine why less perceived discrimination does not show relatively lower disadvantaged chances on indicators of labor market position."

Thus far, research on this topic has been scarce and inconclusive and no research has looked into the experiences of cultural institutions in the Netherlands following the budget cuts of 2012. This research aims to assess the experiences of cultural institutions and to determine whether or not a Matthew effect is present for income flows and location between 2013 and 2016 using a mixed methods design. Data from 474 cultural institutions across the Netherlands were analysed and interviews were conducted with directors representing 11 museums and pop music venues in the province of Utrecht. Gini coefficients showed no Matthew effect for income flows, and no significant trend differences could be found between institutions within or outside the Randstad metropolitan area, both attested by the results of the interviews. The large differences, although stable, between cultural institutions and their experiences within the Netherlands were very apparent. Small institutions struggle to innovate and grow. One-time investments can kickstart a positive spiral towards a more socially relevant an financially healthy position for these small institutions."

Scholars have written extensively about the ways in which the Russian president employs the past in his policy, but an overarching analysis of how Putin has instrumentalised the history of the tsars and the Russian Empire is still missing. Based on over 20.000 speeches and other primary sources that were scraped from the Kremlin website, this thesis supplements the existing literature by analysing how Putin has used history as a usable past to consolidate his power base. Systematically, it traces and plots the development in Putin’s usage and timing of different historical modalities between December 1999 and December 2021. While Putin initially used imperial history as an inspirational tool to strengthen society and international ties, the past gradually transformed into a weapon. Putin waved and swinged this rhetorical sword at home and abroad to justify his actions and secure his power position. By analysing how this occured, this thesis adds more insight into the cards that Putin holds and plays, as history is one of the key weapons of the Kremlin to uphold domestic support."

this research is to identify patterns in time series data from 2021 and forecast when the machine is
going to fail, allowing the source specialist to take preventive action. In this study, a classical machine
learning algorithm and five different neural network architectures were analysed and implemented
to predict a beam decay. The results of the forecasting methods were compared to a baseline model
to decide whether patterns of a beam decay exist. The implemented models were able to reach the
performance of the baseline model but not surpass it. Given the current measurements, it is not

Calcified cartilage tissue engineering: a comparison of hydroxyapatite and β-tricalcium phosphate bioinks,"['Bhushan, Saraswati']","['Dias Castilho, Miguel']",2022-07-14T00:00:47Z,EN,[],Regenerative Medicine and Technology,"654 million people worldwide suffer from knee osteoarthritis, resulting in a reduced quality of life for patients and a burden on the healthcare system. Tissue engineering strategies represent a promising alternative to current surgical interventions in the repair of osteochondral tissue. Tissue engineering strategies have neglected the critical role of the calcified cartilage zone in providing a mechanically competent interphase between soft viscoelastic cartilage and stiff bone. This results in bi-phasic osteochondral scaffolds failing due to phase delamination and dislodgement. The aim of the present study is to propose a new bioink for engineering calcified cartilage tissue. Our study presents a comparison between a hydroxyapatite (HA)-based biomaterial ink and a β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP)-based biomaterial ink. While solvent-based extrusion printing has been used to fabricate HA- PCL (hydroxyapatite- polycaprolactone) scaffolds, to our knowledge, this technique has not been used for the fabrication of β-TCP-PCL scaffolds. Solvent-based extrusion printing can be performed at room temperature avoids the disadvantages associated with printing at high temperatures. The hypothesis is that β-TCP-PCL will induce chondrocyte hypertrophy and faster deposition of a mineralized calcified cartilage layer due to the higher solubility of β-TCP compared to HA. Our study is the first to show that the novel bioink composed of β-TCP-PCL can be processed with solvent-based extrusion printing in the same way as HA-PCL. The biomaterial inks with the highest ceramic concentrations (70%HA- 30% PCL and 70% β-TCP- 30% PCL) have the highest yield stress and consequently best shape fidelity, while printing resolution is similar with a minimum interfibre space of 0.5-1 mm for all concentrations of both groups. Solvent based extrusion printing can be used to print centimeter sized porous scaffolds with both materials (70%HA- 30% PCL and 70% β-TCP -30% PCL). Macropores were in the range of 300-900 um, which facilitates to bone ingrowth. We found that PCL does not mask the ceramic phase and there is a higher release of calcium and phosphorous ions from the β-TCP material. The in vitro experiments showed that cells remained viable and metabolically active over 28 days. In terms of the production of matrix components, small amounts of glycosaminoglycans were produced. Collagen type II was not produced by any of the groups, while Collagen type I was produced by all groups. It is possible that the chondrocytes de-differentiated and consequently produce fibrocartilage. However, to investigate whether the ceramic ions induce chondrocyte hypertrophy and the deposition of a mineralized matrix, a Collagen type X staining and ALP assay should be performed. Therefore, further investigation is required to truly conclude whether the higher soluble β-TCP results in the faster production of calcified cartilage."
Change Detection and Semantic Segmentation of Historical Maps to Detect Indicators of Soil Contamination,"['Barnhoorn, Quintess']","['Kreveld, Marc van']",2022-07-14T00:00:45Z,EN,['historical maps; topographic maps; change detection; semantic segmentation; convolutional neural networks; convolutional recurrent neural networks'],Artificial Intelligence,"Historical maps are commonly used as a source of information to find indicators of soil contamination. The Netherlands has an extensive collection of historical maps, which makes it possible to analyse maps of any location from up to 200 years in the past. Because the analysis of the maps is time-consuming, an automated solution is sought. This thesis makes the first step in this regard by semantically segmenting 90 years of historical maps and detecting changes in the landscape per decade. Automatic change detection with historical maps is a novelty. The methods for this are based on work on remote sensing data. To perform both segmentation and change detection, one general convolutional neural network architecture is proposed, of which several variations are tested. The variations serve to distinguish and compare three main influences on the performance: the first is the influence of multi-temporal inputs on semantic segmentation. Adding the map from a decade after the segmented map to the input did not result in significantly higher performances overall; it is primarily useful in situations where a feature is drawn ambiguously while it is drawn clearly in the decade after it. The second influence is the chosen method to combine multiple maps. The two methods that were tried, namely concatenation and Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units, did not differ in performance for any task. Concatenation is therefore concluded to be the superior method, as it is faster and simpler. The final influence is the choice of performing the two tasks simultaneously or individually. Performing both tasks improved the change detection score while decreasing the segmentation score. Overall, the models learned to generalise features on maps from different decades and locations, with a semantic segmentation F1 score of 88% and a change detection F1 score of 72%. These scores are significantly higher than those of the baseline models based on random forests, which shows the added value of using neural networks for tasks that benefit from context information."

Pain is the main debilitating symptom of degenerated IVD, mainly caused by the ingrowth of nociceptive nerve fibres into the deeper layer of the IVD. The production of pain-related neuropeptides by IVD cells is also responsible for the triggering of nociceptive stimuli involved in pain perception. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the nerve ingrowth processes and the expression of these pain-related markers in degenerative disc disease to determine new strategies for pain treatment. Indeed, it has been shown how the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, celecoxib (CXB) is able to halt degeneration and address IVD-related pain via intradiscal delivery, reducing systemic side effects. In the present study, the presence of nerve fibres and the expression of the neurotrophin NGF in the degenerated IVD were determined in rat and canine models. In addition, the pain-related markers expression was evaluated in vitro in human nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) cell cultures, upon stimulation with TNFα. Overall, pain marker expression was increased upon proinflammatory stimuli. However after CXB treatment, their expression was increased in a dose-dependent manner, in contrast to what is observed in vivo, suggesting the presence and influence of other factors which play a crucial role in the therapeutical effect of CXB in vivo. Moreover, an in vitro model was established using mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants cultured in conditioned media of human inflamed IVD cells to evaluate the effects of the latter on neurites growth. Surprisingly, inflamed conditioned media seems to not have any effect on neurites outgrowth, as well as for the CXB-treated one. However, both conditioned media seemed to have a protective effect against neural cell death, resulting in higher number of living neurons. Certainly, follow-up studies are necessary to determine the mechanisms behind pain in the degeneration of intravertebral discs, including neurites ingrowth and neuropeptide related to pain."

Dit kan leiden tot een gebrek aan sociale acceptatie voor plannen onder zowel inwoners als raadsleden en besluitvorming rondom duurzame energieopwekking electoraal riskant maken voor politieke partijen. 

De regio U16 vormt de focus van dit onderzoek. In de regio is gewerkt aan een regionaal bod, bestaande uit inbreng van zestien gemeenten, waarover op regionaal niveau afstemming is geweest. De besluitvorming voor deze eerste fase van de RES, de RES 1.0, heeft tussen juni en september 2021, zes tot negen maanden voor de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen van 2022, plaatsgevonden. Dit roept de vraag op in hoeverre beslissingen rondom de RES in de regio U16 zijn beïnvloed door de verkiezingen die kort op de besluitvorming volgden. 

Om een goed onderbouwd antwoord te geven op deze vraag is literatuuronderzoek gedaan naar verschillende factoren die invloed kunnen hebben op uitkomsten van besluitvorming: sociale acceptatie, besluitvorming onder riskante omstandigheden en de invloed van verkiezingen op beleid. Vervolgens zijn de variatie in besluitvorming en de verschillende factoren empirisch onderzocht door middel van interviews met betrokken wethouders en raadsleden, het terugkijken van raadsvergaderingen en het analyseren van relevante documenten.

Dit onderzoek biedt een eerste inzicht in de invloed van gemeenteraadsverkiezingen op beslissingen rondom de RES 1.0. Dit is zeer relevant met het oog op de herijking van de RES in 2025, omdat de besluitvorming over de RES 3.0 in 2025 kort voor de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen van 2026 plaatsvindt, terwijl de besluitvorming waarschijnlijk meer risico’s met zich meebrengt.

Op basis van de verzamelde data kan worden geconcludeerd dat in de regio U16 beslissingen rondom de RES 1.0 in wisselende mate zijn beïnvloed door de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen. In sommige gemeenten was de invloed bijna nihil, terwijl de invloed in andere gemeenten groter is geweest. In de gemeente Montfoort is niet ingestemd met de RES 1.0 en in verschillende gemeenten zijn partijen afgeweken van eerder ingenomen standpunten. Daarnaast zijn in sommige gemeenten in de regio partijen groter geworden die stevig hebben ingezet op de RES 1.0 in hun campagne."
Aanval als beste verdediging?,"['Lubberink, Iris']","['Meulen, Martijn van der']",2022-07-14T00:01:03Z,NL,['werkplaatsagressie; agressie; boa; BOA; welzijn; coping; burgeragressie'],Publiek management,"Burgeragressie richting boa’s komt steeds vaker voor en kan negatieve gevolgen hebben voor het welzijn. Boa’s kunnen coping hanteren om met werkplaatsagressie om te gaan en de negatieve gevolgen ervan mogelijk te verminderen. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om de gevolgen van werkplaatsagressie voor het welzijn in kaart te brengen en de rol van coping hierin te verkennen. Meer kennis hierover kan ervoor zorgen dat negatieve gevolgen van werkplaatsagressie kunnen worden tegengegaan. Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: Hoe beïnvloedt werkplaatsagressie het welzijn van boa’s en wat is de rol van coping hierin?. 
Om antwoord te geven op de onderzoeksvraag zijn er empirische deelvragen en verwachtingen opgesteld. Deze deelvragen en verwachtingen zijn onderzocht door semi-gestructureerde interviews af te nemen met boa’s uit verschillende gemeenten. Op basis van de theorie werd verwacht dat werkplaatsagressie een negatieve invloed heeft op de arbeidstevredenheid en de fysieke en mentale gezondheid van boa’s. Uit de bevindingen blijkt echter dat werkplaatsagressie de arbeidstevredenheid in de meeste gevallen niet vermindert. Een mogelijke verklaring hiervoor is dat boa’s meer positieve dan negatieve baankarakteristieken in hun werk ervaren. Wel kan werkplaatsagressie de fysieke en mentale gezondheid van boa’s negatief beïnvloeden. Echter, dit is niet altijd het geval en kan mogelijk worden verklaard door het soort agressie, de interpretatie van agressie, de gemoedstoestand van de boa en de ervaren sociale steun. Deze thema’s kunnen, naast coping, mogelijk als alternatieve moderators fungeren in de relatie tussen werkplaatsagressie en welzijn. Vervolgonderzoek kan deze thema’s verder verkennen. 
Daarnaast is onderzocht welke copingstrategieën boa’s hanteren bij werkplaatsagressie. Uit de bevindingen blijkt dat boa’s alle copingfamilies van Tummers et al. (2015) kunnen hanteren bij werkplaatsagressie. Daarnaast kwam uit de bevindingen van de boa’s de copingstrategie de-escaleren naar voren, die kan worden gezien als aanvulling op de copingfamilies. Vervolgonderzoek kan onderzoeken of deze copingstrategie ook door andere frontliniemedewerkers in de publieke sector wordt gehanteerd. 
Verder werd op basis van de theorie verwacht dat actieve copingfamilies een positief effect hebben op de relatie tussen werkplaatsagressie en het welzijn en dat passieve copingfamilies een negatief effect hebben op deze relatie. Uit de bevindingen blijkt echter dat actieve coping geen garantie is voor een positief effect op de relatie en dat passieve coping geen negatief effect garandeert. De copingeffectiviteit en veiligheidswaarborging leken belangrijker te zijn in het mogelijk verklaren van het effect van coping. Vervolgonderzoek zou deze thema’s verder kunnen onderzoeken.
Er zijn enkele implicaties voor de praktijk. Zo zouden boa’s voldoende middelen moeten hebben om met werkplaatsagressie om te kunnen gaan. Daarnaast moeten de copingstrategieën rantsoenering, agressie en het buigen en breken van regels, zoveel mogelijk voorkomen worden. Tot slot moeten boa’s met elkaar in gesprek over copingstrategieën die effectief blijken te zijn, om van elkaar te kunnen leren."
Efficient and Effective Super Resolution for Single Images using Deep Learning,"['Blijderveen, Steven van']","['Telea, Alex']",2022-07-14T00:00:41Z,EN,['Super resolution;GAN;Neural networks'],Artificial Intelligence,"Super resolution is a class of techniques that aims to increase the resolution of an

cient and effective super resolution method for single images using deep learning.
To tackle this issue, a comparison between different deep learning super resolution
solutions had to be made to find the best framework to improve upon. It was found
Real-ESRGAN is the best starting framework for its fast inference and high quality
output. To improve this framework to the needs of Stapes IT the option of con-
tinuous floating point upscaling factors was added. This was done by cascading
the existing factor 4 and factor 2 models to a factor 8. To quantitatively measure
the quality of the models an image data set relevant to the company was created
and tested using the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Multi-Scale Structural
Similarity Index Measure (MS-SSIM) metrics. For both these metrics, a higher score
indicates a better result. Comparison to the existing SDMD model on the custom
data set shows our cascaded model performs well with PSNR and MS-SSIM scores
of 20.794 and 0.836 compared to 18.042 and 0.730 for SDMD. Using a combination of
Lanczos4 interpolation and linear image blending the model is able to upscale to any
floating point value between 1 and 8 from the existing 2 models. Tested on the same
custom data set the models show a slowly declining average MS-SSIM score linearly
correlated to the height of the upscaling factor starting with 0.984 for an upscaling
factor of 1.5 till 0.836 for factor 8. We conclude that our method proves that creating
super resolution images with continuous upscaling factors is practical, delivering
decent high resolution images and can be implemented in a digital environment for
commercial and practical use."

Improving groundwater level models with machine learning,"['Bischof, Balázs']","['Wanders, Niko']",2022-07-12T00:00:56Z,EN,[],Earth Surface and Water,"To respond to climate change and urbanization, water management systems will need to
adapt in the next decades all over the world, including the Netherlands. Hydrological modelling and
the simplification of real-world processes are vital for managing water resources and systems. In the
future decades, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and neural networks (NN) are projected to
be critical in supporting humans in handling increasing volumes and diversity of data, extracting
relevant information for a specific variable, and offering viable answers to crucial issues. Numerous
articles have showed over the last decade that ML can help hydrologists to model transdisciplinary
and complex systems that are challenging to simulate using standard numerical modelling methods.
Machine learning and neural networks are becoming essential tools for hydrological analysis since
they allow us to handle large amounts of data and extract significant and hidden information, as well
as correlations between hydrological variables. The objective of this study is to enhance the
performance and prediction skill of an existing groundwater level model by evaluating the impact and
relevance of ML model selection and input datasets. For this purpose, a process-based ML approach
was implemented, using the National Hydrological Model for physical consistency along with different
types of input features including meteorological, hydrological, and environmental variables. The
findings reveal that both applied methods are capable of predicting groundwater levels and boosting
the numerical model's capabilities. To better represent and visualize these results a groundwater map
was created for average summer conditions in 250m resolution for the whole area of the Netherlands.
Furthermore, in order to facilitate future groundwater management and research, the feature
importance was evaluated in various situations to examine the overall picture of variable relevance.
The estimated feature importance values and the model’s error results were further examined to
determine whether there are any spatial pattern or trend in the outcomes. From this, it can be
concluded that the model is suitable for modelling typical groundwater levels, but it suffers from
significant error when predicting groundwater extremes, despite the fact that the errors and results
are still more closely related to actual groundwater levels than the numerical model's results. As a
result, the approach works poorer in the southern areas of the Netherlands, such as Limburg and
Maastricht. Additionally, a model was also conducted to explore if the difference between the
numerical model's outputs and real groundwater levels could be estimated. Different scenarios were
investigated, and a generic, simplified model was developed which can predict the errors between
simulation values and actual groundwater observations with an adequate accuracy. This simplified
model might help to model hydrological and environmental processes, since by using this model
groundwater level predictions can be generated without knowing any actual groundwater level values.
In summary, the work includes a detailed description of methodology, demonstrating the required
steps in creating a machine learning model that can predict hydrological processes. The findings can
be used in future study to improve groundwater level predictions and, as a result, water management
strategies in order to reduce the detrimental effects of future groundwater level extremes that could
result in severe droughts or floods."

Impliciete genderstereotypen omvatten onbewuste denkbeelden over mannen en vrouwen die gebaseerd zijn op een automatische respons.

Ook de sekse van het kind bleek geen significante voorspeller te zijn voor de impliciete genderstereotypen van kinderen. Met betrekking tot implementaties voor de praktijk kan gesteld worden dat het van belang is om bewustwording te creëren bij zowel vaders als moeders over de factoren die invloed hebben op de ontwikkeling- en vorming van (traditionele) genderstereotype denkbeelden bij kinderen en hoe kan worden voorkomen dat kinderen zich hierdoor beperkt voelen in de invulling van hun toekomst."
Developing a reactivatable model for for HIV-1 Env expression mimicking latent infection,"['Roovers, Daan']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-07-12T00:00:53Z,EN,[],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"The development of latent infection allows HIV-1 to evade the immune system, providing a major obstacle in the search for curative treatment. The so-called ‘shock and kill’ strategy tackles this problem by reactivating HIV-1 gene expression in latently infected cells, relying on cytopathic effects and the immune system to clear infected cells. Surface presentation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein may be essential to this strategy, as Env is the only viral protein expressed on the cell surface during infection. In this study, Jurkat T-cells were modified to express HIV-1 Env containing an optimised GFP reporter in the fifth variable loop of gp120, driven by the authentic HIV-1 Tat-dependent LTR promoter. Env expression was induced by Panobinostat treatment, indicating that the cell line may serve as a model for Env expression in latently infected and reactivated cells. Treatment with interferon-α-2a was shown to affect the expression of Env during reactivation. The creation of this model cell line presents a powerful tool for research into HIV-1 Env. In furtherance of the ‘shock and kill‘ strategy, a genome wide screen could be performed to identify host factors that affect Env surface levels during latency reversal. The generated cell line was transduced with lentiviral vectors introducing a CRISPR-based knockout of GBP5, resulting in a considerable reduction in basal and IFN-induced expression. In later research, these KO cells can be used to demonstrate the interplay of Env expression with known restriction factors of Env in the context of HIV-1 reactivation."

Vanuit literatuur kwam naar voren dat er een zwak positief verband tussen werkhouding en een betere taalvaardigheid bestaat. Ook laat literatuur zien dat risicofactoren in het gezin zoals een lage ses of armoede, taalvaardigheid van kinderen kan beïnvloeden. Het modererende effect van de risicofactor gezinsomstandigheden was nog niet eerder onderzocht bij het verband tussen de werkhouding en taalvaardigheid. Methode: Voor deze studie is een normatieve steekproef van 265 participanten gebruikt. Taalvaardigheid is gemeten met de cito-scores van de Cito taal voor kleuters van midden en eind groep 2. Voor de werkhouding en de risicofactor gezinsomstandigheden zijn twee door de leerkracht ingevulde vragenlijsten gebruikt: Cohortonderzoek Onderwijsloopbanen (COOL) en het gedeelte gezinsomstandigheden van de Risicocumulatieindex. Resultaten: Het onderzoek heeft zoals verwacht aangetoond dat een minder goede werkhouding een zwak negatief voorspellende waarde heeft op taalvaardigheid midden groep 2. Bij het verband tussen de werkhouding en taalvaardigheid eind groep 2 is eerst gecontroleerd op taalvaardigheid midden groep 2. De werkhouding heeft na deze controlefactor nog nauwelijks effect op taalvaardigheid eind groep 2, waardoor de hypothese niet wordt bevestigd. Evenmin blijkt de risicofactor gezinsomstandigheden het verband tussen de werkhouding en taalvaardigheid te beïnvloeden.

"Obtaining diffuse scattering signal from X-ray
diffraction experiments on lysozyme","['Savenije, Arnold']","['Kroon-Batenburg, L.M.J.']",2022-07-12T00:00:50Z,EN,['Lysozyme; X-ray diffraction; diffuse scattering'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"For decades, X-ray diffraction has been used to determine protein structures in
crystals to atomic level. Nevertheless, while performing X-ray diffraction
experiments, the information regarding the dynamics of the protein molecule has
been largely ignored. This information is contained in the so called diffuse
scattering signal. However, obtaining this diffuse scattering signal remains
challenging because of its low intensity and strong overlap with the signal
originating from the crystal solvent. In this research we describe how to make
suitable protein crystals and how to perform X-ray diffraction experiments to
maximize the diffuse scattering signal. Furthermore, we describe methods to
mask intense features such as Bragg reflections and ice scattering. Then we
demonstrate the mapping and scaling of experimental images to the 3-
dimensional reciprocal space. These experimental 3-dimensional reciprocal
space maps can be compared to reciprocal space maps of models that represent
the diffuse scattering signal. We observe that using method III, sharp features
such as Bragg reflections can be removed as good as performing a modefilter.
Next, if Any is not able to calculate scalefactors without fluctuations, the mean can
be used after strong intensities that do not occur at least 1% as the most frequent
occurring intensity have been removed. Using this approach the experimental
reciprocal space maps show similar features compared to the model maps
concluding that this newly described method can be used to isolate the diffuse
scattering signal. Nevertheless, many features in the model map cannot be
observed in the experimental map. We suggest that this is rather due to the low
photoncount obtained during X-ray diffraction experiments than experimental
data processing and asks for a different approach in performing X-ray diffraction
experiments"

examined whether this phenomenon occurs in the Netherlands. This research investigates if
there is a relationship between the gender-typical occupations of parents and the gendertypical career aspirations of their children. Additionally, we explore whether this relationship
is moderated by the gender of the child. In this study a distinction is made between the two
parents (father and mother) and the gender of the child. 142 Dutch families participated in this
research. These families al consisted of working parents with children between the ages of six
and twelve (40% boys, 60% girls). A questionnaire and a computer task were administered to
the participating families. The parents participated independently and the children under the
supervision of the investigator. The following topics were discussed within the questionnaire
and the computer task: stereotypical expectations about yourself with regard to career and
family, explicit gender role stereotypes, implicit gender role stereotypes, gender identity,
parents’ professions and more. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that no
relation was found between the professions of the parents and the career aspirations of the
children. The gender of the child also did not moderate the associations between parents’
gender typicality of occupation and the gender typicality of children’s occupational aspiration.
It has been recommended that further research will be conducted in the future. This
consecutive research should pay attention to the long-term development of childrens’ career
aspirations. It also should pay attention to the modelling function of the parents and other
adults in the child’s environment. The parents are important role models for the children and
therefore they should encourage their children to choose a career that matches the interest and
competences of the child instead of the gender. This will help to achieve gender equality in
the Netherlands."
A nano-IR study on the mechanistic degradation of UV-exposed PET films,"['Hijlkema, Arjan']","['Meirer, Florian']",2022-07-13T00:00:43Z,EN,[],Nanomaterials Science,"The occurrence of nanoplastics has recently gained awareness as a potential environmental concern. This
has emphasized the necessity to better understand their formation pathways. A relatively new nano-IR tool,
photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM), can provide a way to investigate this; offering a combination of highly
space-resolved topographic and chemical information.

We developed a spectral degradation series using the surface sensitive grazing incidence attenuated total
reflectance (GI-ATR)-IR spectroscopy, in order to better understand the information gathered from PiFM nano-
IR hyper maps of UV-degraded PET films. Spectral features indicative for carboxylic acid end groups were
found to be formed in the film upon UV exposure. These features were additionally found on the outer surface
of the film with PiFM. Yet, their presence showed to be inconsistent over multiple PiFM scans. Also, initial
indications were found in the PiFM scans suggesting differences in the spectral features that may arise from
other (degradative) processes, such as through changes in crystallinity. These results demonstrate the usefulness
of PiFM to differentiate chemical information at the nanoscale, and may help to unravel the formation process
of nanoplastics. However, the observed variability, inconsistency, and proneness to many measurement variables also
underline its complexity.

Furthermore, the development of morphological features measured by the atomic force microscopy (AFM)
scans suggested the initial presence and growth of spherulite-like structures upon UV exposure. Over time, and
upon submergence in water, these morphologies were transformed into more lamellar-like ridge structures which
were elongated in a preferred orientation, seemingly inherent to the structure of the film. For the assessment
of the spectral relation to topography, a tangible methodology was developed. This revealed the heterogeneous
distribution of spectral features and structural properties to the surface topography. In this regard, the most
exemplary observation was a frequently observed asymmetrical distribution of spectral features with respect to
the formed cracks."
Investigating Research Master students’ interests in Research Integrity to improve its education,"['Zandstra, Romy']","['Veldkamp, Alice']",2022-07-13T00:00:55Z,EN,['research integrity; research integrity education; research master students; ethical dilemmas'],Science Education and Communication,"Research Integrity (RI) covers ethical concerns during the different stages of the research cycle. RI 
education has gained attention in response to a series of scandals of misconduct, and means to 
teach students Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR). However, current RI education is not rated 
highly and considered boring by Research Master (RMA) students at Utrecht University, jeopardising 
its ability to reach its goals.

This research aims to identify topics within RI that RMA students find most interesting, so RI 
education can then be shifted to focus more on those topics, hopefully reawakening RMA students’ 
interest in RI. A secondary aim was to discover if a RMA student’s Graduate School was an important 
determinant for their interest in certain topics within RI. 

The study consisted of two parts, a questionnaire to collect quantitative data on which topics within 
RI are important to RMA students of Utrecht University, and then semi-structured interviews to 
gather qualitative data on why these topics are considered relevant or interesting. The questionnaire 
received 114 responses from students of the Graduate Schools of Humanities, Natural Sciences, Life 
Sciences, Teaching, Social and Behavioural Sciences, Geosciences and Pharmacy. The interviews 
numbered four in total, with students from the Graduate School of Teaching.

The questionnaire revealed that topics on communicating with and support from supervisors, ethical 
handling of both quantitative and qualitative data (from safekeeping participants’ privacy to 
selecting proper statistical methods), collaboration with peers and referencing correctly are
perceived as most important. 

Interviews and qualitative data from the questionnaire showed that especially the first two topics 
(supervisor and data) are considered important, due to the large impact both have on the eventual 
success and graduation of a student. The ‘collaboration with peers’ topic received more diverse
responses, with some students finding it unnecessary to further learn about, while others do find it 
important. ‘Referencing’ was generally considered an important topic, but not as important as the 
other three.

When looking at differences between the different Graduate Schools, the topic ‘data’ seemed most 
divisive. There were both major differences in what kinds of data (qualitative or quantitative) 
students from different Graduate Schools were familiar with, resulting in different ethical concerns 
being raised, but there was a differing level of guidance required as well. Maths-related RMA 
students do not collect or have to work with any type of data for their research, whereas the 
Graduate School of Geoscience students are taught hardly anything regarding data, as well as RI in 
general and referencing, so they have great need for education regarding these topics.
 
Keeping these nuances in mind, the results imply that RI educational developers should focus on 
flexible education and include several different ethical dilemmas regarding the four topics of 
supervisor, data, collaboration with peers and references, with the RI teacher then selecting the 
appropriate ones for the students and maybe sub-dividing the students into different groups based 
on interest."

Examples of sensors that are used to collect lifelog data are (wearable) cameras, GPS, and sensors collecting biometric data. This activity results in lifelogs, that is, multimodal databases containing large amounts of data that is challenging to navigate. Related research mostly focuses on lifelog retrieval; building a system which can retrieve specific data of the lifelog. These systems are made to enable the user to retrieve certain memories. Yet, they lack in supporting exploration of the data for leisure browsing or situations with a less clear information need, for example, when people only vaguely remember a certain situation. A good visualization of a lifelog's content and the ability to filter it as needed could encourage and support such exploration, but related studies are sparse. Therefore, in this thesis we aim to determine if geospatial visualization and temporal filtering techniques can be used to make lifelogs accessible and easy to search and explore. To achieve this, we implemented and evaluated a system, the Lifelog Browser, which visualizes the LSC'20 test collection, a benchmark lifelog dataset, and makes it accessible. The system features three different geospatial visualizations (Dot map, Cluster map and Heat map) and three different temporal filtering techniques (color-coded Week matrix, color-coded Month matrix and Custom drop-down), which were evaluated for suitability for different search goals in the context of lifelog data. This was done through a user study which included both a lifelog exploration and retrieval challenge, inspired by the Lifelog Search Challenge. Our results show that this type of system is suitable for lifelog access, search and exploration and that out of the chosen approaches, the Cluster geospatial visualization and Custom drop-down temporal filtering technique are considered most useful for lifelog exploration and search."

Thermostatic systems are a simplification of thermodynamic systems, retaining only the information necessary to discuss equilibria. Port-Hamiltonian systems are a generalization of classical mechanical systems that allow for energy to flow in and out of a system. The theory we use to formalize the composition of both of these systems is the theory of operads and operad algebras, and we hope to demonstrate that this theory has rich application beyond our use of it, and thus is a promising future point of study."

Daarnaast stellen verschillende sportorganisaties als de KNVB, KNLTB en SportUtrecht dat thuisgevoel bijdraagt aan ledenbehoud, een nieuwe aanwas van leden en actieve vrijwilligers. Echter waar mensen zich thuis voelen, worden ook mensen uitgesloten. Er is al onderzoek gedaan naar waarom specifieke groepen, als LHBTI’s en mensen met een migratieachtergrond, zich niet thuis voelen bij een sportvereniging. Echter ontbrak er nog kennis over welke elementen ervoor zorgen dat men zich wel thuis voelt bij een sportvereniging en of dit wenselijk is.
Het doel van dit onderzoek is om inzicht te krijgen in de betekenisgeving van leden van Nederlandse sportverenigingen met betrekking tot het ervaren thuisgevoel en of dit wenselijk is voor de sportvereniging. Het is daarbij belangrijk te achterhalen welke factoren hierbij een positieve rol vervullen om zodoende sportverenigingen te kunnen adviseren over of en hoe zij thuisgevoel op de vereniging kunnen creëren. De volgende onderzoeksvraag staat daarbij centraal:

Welke betekenis geven leden van een sportvereniging aan het ervaren thuisgevoel op de vereniging en wat zijn hiervan de beleidsimplicaties op verenigingsniveau?

Om een antwoord te kunnen geven op de onderzoeksvraag is gebruik gemaakt van een casestudy bij voetbalvereniging S.v.S.S.S. uit Udenhout. Het belangrijkste raamwerk in het onderzoek is het PPP-model of Place Attachment (Scannell & Gifford, 2009) en daarnaast is gebruik gemaakt van de theorieën rondom ‘beloningness’, homogeniteit en socialisatie. Vervolgens hebben 12 interviews met leden van S.v.S.S.S. en drie observaties bij de sportvereniging plaatsgevonden. 

Uit de dataverzameling bleek dat thuisgevoel op de sportvereniging wenselijk is en dat de ons-kent-ons-cultuur, het dorpse karakter van de vereniging, veiligheid en respect, het gevoel gewaardeerd te worden en jezelf te kunnen zijn, het gevoel erbij te horen en de herinneringen die men heeft bij de fysieke plaats de belangrijkste elementen zijn om je thuis te voelen bij een sportvereniging. Een aantal van deze elementen zijn te organiseren door de sportvereniging.

Op basis van de resultaten wordt de sportvereniging aanbevolen om in te zetten op een thuisgevoel bij de leden en de bevorderende elementen te organiseren en faciliteren. Eventueel vervolgonderzoek zou zich kunnen richten op het reproduceren van dit onderzoek in de context van een ‘stadse’ vereniging."
Implementation strategies for circular business models in emerging fashion start-ups,"['Raganato, Marco']","['Appelman, Jaco']",2022-07-14T00:01:13Z,EN,['Fashion industry / Sustainability / Regenerative textile / Recycling / Circular Business Models / Start-ups / LCA'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"Due to industrialisation and the explosion of the “fast fashion” phenomenon, the production of textiles and clothes has more than doubled in the last two decades and is expected to increase by a further +30% in the next 10 years (Textile Exchange Report, 2020). 

Worldwide, only 20% of the clothing produced is recycled, while the remaining 80% is incinerated or landfilled (Koszewska et al., 2018). As a result, the fashion industry is considered the second most polluting sector in the world and must evolve urgently. 

Therefore, a “paradigm shift” is necessary in order to implement sustainability and circular economy principles in this market system which has such a tremendous economic and environmental impact.
Different techniques for the production, recycling and reuse of textiles have recently been developed, but they need to be improved and opened up not only to multinational brands but also to small emerging businesses.

Hence, this literature review attempts to provide an overview of the most innovative and recent techniques for the production, recycling and reuse of textiles and clothes available on the market today with relevant case studies. In addition, it offers a number of practical tools useful for the transition from linear to circular business models, particularly for fashion enterprises. 
Finally, it suggests an involvement of all major stakeholders throughout the value chain to implement sustainability and thus achieve a shared and synergic economy; generating holistic multiple-added value and business models that are resilient to change and future-proof."

“Un-shelfing shelved assets to boost deal activity”,"['Haan, Floor de']","['Springer, Klaas']",2022-07-15T00:00:32Z,EN,['Kempen; Business; Finance; Deal activity; Life science; Shelved assets'],Science and Business Management,"The first quarter of 2022 has shown an unfavorable stock market environment for companies active in the life science and health sector. The Kempen Life Science & Health (LS&H) sector team of the investment banking department saw this reflected in a decreased deal activity. This, consequently, meant that the sector team was not measuring up the amount of deals they partook in the first quarter of the year prior. The stock market and all activities surrounding it are known for its endless opportunities and entrepreneurial environment. This means there is always room for business development and ways to be creative and work around external factors. The problem at hand was decreased deal activity and the goal was to increase deal activity. LS&H sector team is active in different types of deals, one of them being the sale and acquisition of assets. For life science companies these assets often come in the form of drugs. Many companies have drugs that they are no longer developing/ testing, otherwise known as shelved assets. If a company has shelved assets which it no longer plans to develop further, then they might be interested in selling said asset. This is where the LS&H team can step in and facilitate the process by reaching out to companies and inquire whether they are interested in selling or acquiring shelved assets from/ to another company. 

This thesis explores the idea of facilitating deals as a possible form of business development. This was done by creating a theoretical framework of background information such as information on the life science stock market, the ‘normal’ drug developing process, the drug repurposing/ reviving process, and approaches for drug repurposing. This is followed by a quantitative and qualitative research where both the current and historic shelved asset landscape is represented. The quantitative research is in the form of a database that was created, where all currently shelved assets of life science companies were logged and analyzed. Shelved assets were admitted to the list based on a set of criteria and analyzed to gain insight in current trends and patterns. The qualitative research was a search into previous cases where a shelved asset played a central role. Examples of deals where the sale of a shelved asset led to a successful drug are described in this thesis to give some context to the possibilities and potential they hold. 

The key take aways from the theoretical background were that the life science stock market and thus deal activity were down in the first quarter of 2022, as is mentioned at the beginning of this text as well. Furthermore, ‘normal’ drug development and clinical testing is extremely expensive and time consuming. For this reason, it might be interesting for companies to look into shelved asset drugs that has already been developed and been through some clinical trials. This shelved asset can be used for the intended disease it was developed for, in this case it will be referred to as reviving a shelved asset, or it can be tested in another disease, this will be referred to as repurposing a shelved asset. There are a few different approaches that can be taken to figure out which disease the repurposed drug might be effective in. The approaches can be divided into two types: computational approaches (data driven) and experimental approaches (research driven). 

In conclusion, the combination of current and historical data shows that shelved assets are very prevalent and deals concerning shelved assets can be very successful. The main point of interest is however whether this approach could facilitate deals. After analyzing all the data, it seems that pro-actively proposing shelved assets as deal opportunities could benefit deal activity."

Investigation of cerebral vascular abnormalities in TOF-MRA brain images,"['Donno, Giulia De']","['Kuijf, Hugo']",2022-08-18T01:00:35Z,EN,['Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysm (UIA); Aneurysm detection; Z-score; TOF-MRA; Atlas; Vessel abnormalities'],Medical Imaging,"Abnormalities in the arterial system can lead to a series of cerebrovascular diseases including unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs). UIAs are present in around 3% of the population, and upon rupture, 35% of cases result in death and most of the survivors are left with long-term disabilities. Aneurysms are usually small in size and vary greatly in shape and position in the vessel configuration. It is one of the reasons why up to 10% of UIAs are missed during screening. For this reason, in this study, an automatic atlas-based method of at-risk-areas and aneurysm detection is presented. The pipeline outputs a color-coded map that can be superimposed on the TOF-MRA image, indicating areas that diverge from the average healthy anatomy in the form of Z-scores. High Z-scores are potentially linked to the presence of abnormalities. This method was tested on 19 TOF-MRA containing one aneurysm above 5 mm in radius and 18 images with healthy anatomy. After preprocessing, the TOF-MRA underwent vessel segmentation and vessel radius calculation. The resulting image, as well as the preprocessed atlases registered to the patient’s space, are then used to calculate the Z-score maps. Using two different types of segmentation for evaluation, aneurysms were detected in up to 17 images out of 19. An analysis of the Z-scores in areas outside the segmentations showed no statistical differences compared to the Z-score map from healthy subjects. This method has the potential to be useful in a clinical setting, as well as research, as part of larger projects."

However, park creation had been a conservation tool since the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The aim of this thesis is to explain why the 1960s witnessed a new surge in park creation. In this thesis, I argue that a conservation regime change took place between the 1920s and 1960s, from a regime based on the idea that parks should protect “wilderness” and “pristine” nature, to a regime based on the idea that the main function of parks was to protect threatened species. I argue that the rise of a global “park-species” conservation regime was enabled by the synergy between the conservation tools of park creation and “red listing” (classifying and
prioritizing species in order of their perceived extinction risk by creating threatened species lists). In this regard, I argue that conservationists increasingly used threatened species lists as a biopolitical conservation instrument with which to exert influence over territories, while park creation can be considered as a territorial conservation instrument with biopolitical implications. I argue that the entanglement between these two conservation tools altered the way in which conservationists could exert power over territory, people and species, which enabled the surge in protected areas in the 1960s. To analyze these phenomena, this thesis is focused on a case study of the conservation of the Javan rhino (Rhinoceros sondaicus) in the Ujung Kulon Wildlife Reserve on Java, Indonesia (former Dutch East Indies), between the 1920s and 1960s."

Carbon colonialism: How forest-related carbon removal projects in the Global South reproduce colonial power structures,"['Nous, Namera']","['Biermann, Frank']",2022-09-09T03:02:41Z,EN,['carbon dioxide removal; carbon colonialism; justice; postcolonialism; discourse'],Sustainable Development,"Current efforts to limit global warming are falling short and forest-related carbon dioxide removal (CDR) projects are increasingly relied upon by states to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. CDR in the forest sector encompasses reforestation, reduced deforestation, afforestation, as well as silvicultural investment and sustainable forest management. The term carbon colonialism was introduced to describe CDR-projects as a new variation of colonialism by using climate policies to reproduce power structures that allow for the exploitation of the Global South. Under this term, CDR-projects have been criticised for promoting continued overconsumption, placing the burden of the resulting negative environmental impacts on the Global South, and reproducing historically oppressive systems with colonial dynamics. As forestry is mentioned as a priority in terms of adaptation and mitigation in achieving the Paris goals in around 50% of the Nationally Determined Contributions as updated in 2021, the number of CDR-projects on an international level will increase in the coming years and it is therefore crucial to consider these justice-related problems. 
This paper unveils and criticises power structures that are present in the discourse on CDR-projects and spaces for action by conducting a Postcolonial Critical Discourse Analysis (PCDA) of the UNFCCC annual reports, COP session documents, as well as related COP documents from the UNFCCC platforms REDD+ and Climate Action, retrieved from the UNFCCC website in the period of 2015 to 2021, yielding a sample of 231 texts. Postcolonial theory is aimed at uncovering issues of oppression, inequality and fighting for equal access to resources and power internationally. This is combined with Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), a research strategy focused on highlighting power imbalances and injustices in textual discourse and how these are reproduced and perpetuated. The insights from this research reveal that carbon colonialism is present in the discourse on CDR-projects as most projects take place or are planned in the Global South and there is an overemphasis of its potential positive effects and relative ignorance of its potential negative effects and environmental justice issues. There is currently still limited political liberation of formerly colonised countries and addressing this in international climate discourse is a first step in challenging these power inequalities and advancing the cause of environmental and social justice."

Theoretical and Practical Aspects of Isolation Forest,"['Sterkenburg, Mark']","['Oosterlee, C.W.']",2022-09-09T03:02:49Z,EN,[],Mathematical Sciences,"Outlier detection methods are becoming increasingly more popular, for example, in the financial world to detect fraudulent transactions. In this thesis, we explore the Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm which is a data-driven anomaly detection method. This method distinguishes itself from other outlier detecting methods, because it isolates the outliers directly instead of creating a profile of the normal instances. However, there is not much theory known behind this algorithm and therefore this is explored in this thesis. Theory based on the number of random splits needed to isolate a datapoint is developed and numerically validated with the IF algorithm. Moreover, new outlier detection methods are developed by combining the original IF algorithm with the theoretical formulas of this algorithm. With these methods, the outliers in multi-dimensional datasets can be detected due to the projection they are using to transform multi-dimensional datasets into one-dimensional ones. We test these methods rigorously for multiple different datasets and that shows us very good performances of some of these new methods. Furthermore, the original IF algorithm is used for further testing of multiple components of this algorithm. For example, the impact of pruning the isolation trees and the number of trees on the performance of the algorithm are tested. Also, different scoring functions are tested in combination with this algorithm. The IF algorithm is also compared with two other outlier detection methods and shows very good results when detecting the most outlying points of multiple random datasets. Finally, a real-world financial dataset is used to test the new methods and the original IF method on. On this dataset, the Transformed IF method gives more accurate results than the original IF algorithm."

Learning analytics can be shown on dashboards (LADs) and provide formative feedback. Students use points of reference to compare their performance to. This study researches LADs using social reference frames and progress reference frames. LADs with social reference frames compare students’ performance to their peers’ performance. LADs with progress reference frames compare students’ performance to their own previous performance. On the LADs, score delta is presented too. This shows students the difference between their score and their point of reference. Research has shown different effects of LADs with different reference frames. More specifically, the effect of LADs with different reference frames on self-efficacy has not yet received much attention. This study has researched the effects of LADs with a progress reference frame and a social reference frame on self-efficacy, the effect of the direction of score delta on self-efficacy, and whether score delta has a moderating effect. No significant results have been found. Previous research has found that LADs with reference frames increase motivation, social anxiety and stress. Possibly, these factors have mediated the effects. Nevertheless, a negative effect has not been found either. This means that the choice of the type reference frame is irrelevant."
Supply and consumption diversity of NPO’s genres on linear TV and on demand,"['Coetzee, Janke']","['Nguyen, Dennis']",2022-09-09T03:02:50Z,EN,['competition; open diversity; diversity-as-received; diversity-as-sent; reflective diversity; genre diversity; public service media'],Applied Data Science,"Over the last few decades, the process of platformisation has been acknowledged and researched more often, including its impact on public service media (PSM). The Dutch public broadcaster, NPO (Nederlandse Publieke Omroep), has adjusted accordingly to the digitisation of services by offering their on demand service, NPO Start. While doing so, NPO maintains a public task of reaching different audience groups by maintaining the public values diversity and pluriformity. Therefore, it is significant to analyse whether NPO meets their audience’s demands by offering diverse content. Hence, this research aims to analyse whether the supply and consumption diversity of NPO have changed between linear TV and on demand over the last four years with regards to their genres. This is especially significant within these times, in which the media landscape is altering continuously and rapidly and NPO strives to remain relevant to their audience. In order to analyse this, the operationalisation conducted by van der Wurff (2004) is adopted by implementing the concepts of open diversity-as-sent, open diversity-as-received, reflective diversity, intra-channel diversity, and inter-channel diversity. Here, the competition of channels is also crucial to reflect on, as this influences what the audience watches. The results suggest that there are differences in consumption diversity between linear TV and on demand as well as between prime time and daytime. This is related to the channel diversity, which emphasises NPO’s policy in which certain audience groups are aimed to be reached on particular channels and during particular time frames. It is crucial to continuously analyse whether current adjustments in their policies meet their audience’s demands in order to remain relevant and maintain social welfare."

business in ways that respect the social- and natural environment. When CSR engagement is
perceived as sincere, it can serve as a strong tool to attract prospective employees
(Crumpacker and Crumpacker, 2007; Kim & Park, 2011; Kumari et al., 2020). This study
examines whether this positive effect especially holds for people who care deeply about the
environment. Given that environmentally conscious individuals value the preservation of
natural resources, they are likely to be attracted to organizations whose CSR commitment
comes across as sincere. With an experimental between-subject design we examined whether
environmentally conscious individuals, in particular, are receptive to the sincerity of CSR
statements. Participants were asked to fill out a survey during which CSR engagement was
manipulated to evoke variety in perceived CSR sincerity. Surprisingly, environmental
consciousness did not increase job attraction towards socially responsible organizations.
Thus, more research is needed to confirm the important role of individual environmental
values in considering new job positions."

Daarnaast liep een recordaantal militairen PTSS op. Er zijn twijfels over de legitimiteit van de aanwezigheid van Nederland in het land vanwege een onduidelijke vijand en een vertekend missiedoel. Wegens de ellende die oorlogsvoering veroorzaakt is het relevant om het faciliterende gedachtegoed hiervoor te onderzoeken. Conflicten komen voort uit antagonistisch onderscheid tussen groepen, waarin een verharde tegenstelling is ontstaan tussen het zelfbeeld en het heterobeeld. Onderzoek naar beeldvorming in boeken is relevant vanwege de wisselwerking tussen literatuur en invloedrijke culturele fenomenen als groepsvorming en nationalisme en de rol die deze spelen in het legitimeren van oorlogsvoering. Eerder onderzoek op het gebied van representatie van nationale en culturele verschillen beperkt zich grotendeels tot Amerikaanse cultuurproducten of Nederlandse mediaberichtgeving. Om meer inzicht te krijgen in hoe Nederlandse literatuur vormgeeft aan nationale en culturele verschillen en hiermee geopolitiek geweld zoals in Afghanistan legitimeert, heb ik een imagologische analyse uitgevoerd op drie Nederlandse militaire autobiografieën over de missie in Afghanistan gedurende de periode 2006-2009. Hierbij is onderzocht welke binaire Zelf-Ander-opposities tot stand komen en met welke tekstuele strategieën deze worden gevormd.
Uit de corpusanalyse konden vier Zelf-Ander-opposities worden ontwaard, namelijk de ISAF-militair versus de Talibanstrijder, de ISAF-militair versus de Afghaanse burger, Nederland versus de coalitiegenoten en de krijgsmacht versus de politiek. Binnen deze opposities wordt de Ander gedifferentieerd aan de hand van vijandelijk vuur, ideologische conventies, oriëntalistische stereotypering, humanitaire stereotypering, nationaliteit en institutionele cultuurverschillen. Daarnaast veronderstelt mijn analyse dat oorlogsvoering in dit corpus wordt gelegitimeerd op basis van een combinatie van xenofobe en paternalistische retoriek als tekstuele strategieën. Vervolgonderzoek zou kunnen uitwijzen of de bevindingen overeenkomen in Afghaanse literatuur of met een groter corpus. Aan de hand van de conclusie wordt aanbevolen om kritisch academisch onderzoek naar antagonistische beeldvorming en literaire conventies te blijven uitbreiden om waar mogelijk onnodige oorlogsvoering te kunnen voorkomen door maatschappelijke bewustwording."
Multispecies Justice. Philosophical and political considerations for multispecies futures.,"['Grelle, Rosalie Le']","['Kalfagianni, Agni']",2022-09-09T04:01:55Z,EN,[],Sustainable Development,"The consequences of climate change, such as the massive decline in biodiversity and the increasing magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events, have challenged the western theorisation of a disentangled relationship between humans and nature, with interdependence all the more evident. This dichotomous imaginary, cemented by the philosophies of the enlightenment, makes the interrogation of our anthropocentric ontology almost unimaginable.
The emerging field of Multispecies Justice (MSJ), however, gives the possibility to think differently and reconfigure biocentric individualism around questions of ontology, ethics, and justice. This disruptive potential is due to the fact that MSJ profoundly interrogates western anthropocentric knowledge creation by having the ambition to practice relational ontologies. This research proposes an in-depth analysis of MSJ’s potential by conducting a theoretical, as well as an empirical, analysis.
The first part of the research included explorative and philosophical research for the consolidation of MSJ, considering that its literature is rather fragmented. Jointly, artistic research was conducted to probe the possibility of shaping multispecies imaginaries by building bridges between art and science. Secondly, by using the findings of this first analysis, this research addressed the concretisation and practicability of MSJ by con- ducting political scientific research that analysed the extent to which MSJ is reflected in sustainable governance practices. Through the integration of the results of the theoretical as well as the empirical analysis, this research laid a foundation to cement Multispecies Justice in our collective imaginary by giving innovative ways to reconceptualise a justice that encompasses all living beings of the Earth."

Hieruit blijkt dat de middeleeuws-christelijke lichtmetafysica te herleiden is tot principes uit de laatantieke neoplatoonse filosofie, en dat het middeleeuws kunstbegrip gerelateerd is aan de metafysische kwaliteiten van licht. De geschriften van abt Suger van Saint-Denis maken deze relatie op sprekende wijze inzichtelijk. In de tweede plaats worden publicaties bestudeerd die betrekking hebben op de aanwezigheid van een metafysische betekenislaag in de vroegnederlandse schilderkunst, en worden de belangrijkste argumenten die hiervoor pleiten uiteengezet. Tevens wordt aandacht besteed aan publicaties waarin een materieel-iconografische interpretatie van licht en zijn effecten in de vroegnederlandse schilderkunst wordt voorgesteld. Hieruit zal blijken dat een materiële en metafysische iconografie elkaar niet per definitie uitsluiten, maar dat zij ook als aanvulling op elkaar ingezet kunnen worden. In de derde plaats zal aan de hand van De aanbidding van het Lam Gods en Madonna met kanunnik Joris van der Paele worden betoogd dat een combinatie van opvattingen uit de metafysische en materiële iconografie de moderne beschouwer in staat stelt de complexe, vaak gelaagde symbolische betekenis van licht, transparantie en glans in Jan van Eycks schilderkunst vollediger te begrijpen. Ten slotte worden de belangrijkste bevindingen uit bovenstaande onderdelen samengevat om een antwoord te formuleren op de onderzoeksvraag, en zullen suggesties worden gedaan voor vervolgonderzoek."
Beyond punitive opposition: cancel culture in relation to queer storytelling,"['Pardo, Morena']","['Olivieri, Domitilla']",2022-09-09T04:01:44Z,EN,"['cancel culture, punitivism, queer storytelling, worlding, audiovisual fiction']",GEMMA: Master degree in Women's and Gender studies,"Abstract


Cancelling has become an increasingly resonant word in the past years, and it has adopted particular modes in the field of pop culture and media. This research aims to explore the ways in which cancel culture relates to and with contemporary Western works of visual fiction, by analyzing the cases of the independent feature film Adam (2018), by Rhys Ernst, and the third season of mainstream comedy series Master of None, titled Moments in Love (2021). 

Firstly, by the means of a genealogy, I situate cancel culture in a trajectory of kin practices of accountability and punishment. Accompanied by abolitionist thinkers, queer and feminist theory and criminology, I analyze which notions of accountability and justice are encompassed in these cancellation efforts, and how they are related with punitivism, activism and social justice movements. Guided by these main questions, I also inquire around further interrogations that preeminently emerge from this subject matter, such as where does cancel culture happen, who are the agents of cancellation, why do we regard it as a form of culture, what does it mean to cancel work of fictions, and how could we come to regard this phenomenon otherwise. Through a diffractive approach (Barad, 2007) that refuses oppositional readings and argumentations and seeks to staying with the problem/atic, I examine how cancel culture influences practices of queer storytelling as worlding, understood by Donna Haraway (2016) as a form of world-making with. 

Through this engagement, I argue that, as a punitive oppositional practice, cancel culture seeks to separate itself from conflict, accountability and relational world-making by trying to make the problem/atic disappear."
Desert Power: A Chronological Comparison of Dune and Its Relationship With Contemporary American Views Towards Islam,"['Vlaanderen, Abel']","['Gillett, R.A.']",2022-09-09T04:01:53Z,EN,['Dune; Islam; America; islamophobia; racism; close reading; world-building; science fiction; Frank Herbert; David Lynch; Denis Villeneuve;'],Cultuurgeschiedenis van modern Europa,"This study sets out to examine the relationship between Frank Herbert’s science fiction epic Dune and contemporary American views towards Islam. It investigates the first Dune novel (1965), the 1984 film adaptation by David Lynch and the most recent reworking by Denis Villeneuve, entitled Dune: Part One. I posit that a chronological comparison of their historical contexts can illuminate how Americans viewed Islam in the 1960s, the 1980s and today. This is inspired by John Rieders thoughts on the science fiction genre as “historical and mutable.” I approach this study by close reading the texts of the three works in question and then confronting my findings with secondary literature on the contemporary American views of Islam. David Greenham’s conceptualization of close reading is helpful here, especially his thoughts on the adversarial context. In this study, I also use reviews of both film adaptations in order to illustrate my results. The concept of world-building as theorized by Mark Wolf is central to this analysis. This means that I focus on the building blocks of the Duniverse, not on plot or character development. Language features prominently, because it is important for the construction of imaginary worlds. Two final significant concepts here are drawn from adaptation studies: an archival and teleological reading of adaptations. Here, recent research by David Amadio on Dune (1984) helps our thinking about the Islamic and Arabic elements of Dune (1984) and Dune: Part One. This study finds that consumers use already existing knowledge to “fill out” an imaginary world and that this influences how a world is seen. This suggests that dominant ideas of Islam are mirrorred in Dune. Finally, this chronological comparison identifies numerous areas for further research on Dune and its historical contexts."

A systematic review should include all relevant studies, regardless of the language it is conducted in. Machine translation of abstracts helps here, but it is unknown how classification performance changes when abstracts are translated. This study simulates the active learning process with English datasets, and with the same datasets that were machine-translated to German, Spanish and Turkish. A key step in the active learning pipeline is the generation of a vector representation of the text, using a feature extractor. The feature extraction methods tf-idf, Doc2Vec, FastText and SBERT were compared on their classification performance for all languages. The results show that no consistent disadvantage to translation can be found for the selected datasets, except for FastText."

De meeste gemeenten hadden in het woonbeleid al doelstellingen over het realiseren van
sociale woningbouw, maar nemen steeds vaker ook het middeldure segment op in woonbeleid

In dit onderzoek is naar het antwoord gezocht op de vraag: ‘In hoeverre zijn gemeentelijke
beleidsdoelstellingen voor een verdeling van woningbouwcategorieën effectief?’.
Beleidseffectiviteit is hiervoor eerst benaderd als ‘conformiteit’. Dit is de mate waarin de
uitwerking van beleid overeenkomt met de van te voren bedachte doelstelling. Hiervoor is
geprobeerd bij gemeenten binnen de Metropoolregio Amsterdam een statistische vergelijking
te maken tussen de verdeling van woningbouwcategorieën, beleidsdoelstellingen, de
plancapaciteit en uiteindelijke realisatie van woningen. Ten tweede is beleidseffectiviteit
benaderd als ‘doorwerking’. Doorwerking vindt plaats wanneer beleid als hulpmiddel wordt
gebruikt bij het maken van beslissingen. Hiervoor zijn interviews verricht met medewerkers
van gemeenten.

De scope van het onderzoek werd beperkt door de beschikbaarheid van gegevens over
woningbouw in verschillende categorieën en de mate waarin deze te vergelijken zijn. Toch
lijken de gevonden resultaten bij beide benaderingen van beleidseffectiviteit erop te wijzen
dat doelstellingen over woningbouwcategorieën effectief zijn om te sturen op het realiseren
van betaalbare woningen."
The extent of sentiment on sexual health topics between moderated and non-moderated websites,"['Lai, Jaimy']","['Veltkamp, Remco']",2022-09-09T04:01:50Z,EN,"['sentiment, dutch, Nederlands, fora, sentiment analyse, sentiment analysis']",Applied Data Science,"Sexual health information shared online is not always credible. Due to the nature of the internet, and how it allows anyone to create or spread content, often misinformation occurs, and being misinformed about (sexual) health can be dangerous. This sparks a research interest to create a model that can predict credibility, in this case, sexual health information. To create a model, we must identify which factors mediate and modulate credibility. In this study, the aim is to evaluate ’sentiment’ as a marker of credibility prediction. Using a moderated and a non-moderated source, we can compare if there is a significant statistical difference between the sentiment on sexual health information between the two sources. A statistical difference would indicate that sentiment is a promising candidate for credibility predictions, and the sentiment can tell sources apart in terms of credibility. Using a rule-based method (Pattern.nl) to compute sentiment and statistical analysis methods, it was concluded that there was no statistically sig- nificant difference between the credible and non-credible sources in terms of sentiment. However, some intruiging patterns surfaced such as the non-credible source scoring higher on high levels of sentiment, or a subtopic within sexual health information that did return statistically significant with a small effect size. Therefore, more research should be conducted to further analyze this marker."
Agent-Based Modelling of Trans-Atlantic Bird Flights,"['Blom, Axel']","['Gravey, Mathieu']",2022-09-09T04:02:15Z,EN,[],Applied Data Science,"Many North American bird species migrate towards South America to spend the
colder seasons. Occasionally, some of the birds that were meant to migrate south arrive
in Europe, far outside of their normal habitat. It is hypothesized that strong, eastward
winds allow these vagrant birds to reach the other side of the Atlantic oceans.
This paper presents a model for simulating migratory bird flights that takes wind speeds
into account to gain some insight in the influence of wind circumstances on these bird
flights. Simulations were run with birds starting on the eastern coast of North America
between 30◦and 70◦latitude in the autumnal months of 2016 to 2020 using two different
strategies for orientation.
Results show that strong eastern winds allow birds to reach Europe from North America.
Factors that distinguished birds that reached Europe from other birds in this model are a
high wind speed and a starting position between 45 and 56 . While high eastward wind speeds make it possible for Nearctic birds to reach Europe, they might not sufficiently explain the phenomenon of vagrants: when birds navigate towards a goal, the wind speed and direction has a much smaller influence on the trajectory. Other orientation strategies or malfunctioning of the navigation apparatus of birds might provide more explanation."

Despite a growing body of literature on minority stress, research investigating its connection to the psychological needs of sexual minorities is still scarce. As rural sexual minorities have been shown to experience more stigmatization and are thus more exposed to minority stress and potentially also more need frustration, the moderating role of rural culture was taken into consideration. Therefore, it was the aim of the present study to investigate the relationship between minority stress and basic psychological need satisfaction/frustration, and the moderating effect of rural vs urban residency. 156 non-heterosexuals (57.1% women, 16% men, 26.9% other genders; mean age = 24.6) completed the cross-sectional online survey. Contrary to the expectations, moderation analyses showed no significant effects of expected rejection and self-concealment in relation to need satisfaction and frustration, nor any moderating effect of the geographic residence. Yet, significant effects of gender were found. Limitations are discussed and suggestions for additional research are provided."

In addition, the global sequencing surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants generated a great share of information on the emergence and spread of new variants that has been valuable for governments on taking appropriate measurements to control the disease spread, but also for researchers for the evaluation and updating of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. 
This report demonstrates some of the possible applications of the Ion Torrent Genexus Integrated Sequencer and the Seegene Allplex SARS-CoV-2 Variant I PCR assay during the COVID-19 pandemic, including diagnostic assay evaluation, the investigation of vaccine breakthrough infections, and SARS-CoV-2 variant surveillance. First, SARS-CoV-2 sequencing performance data of the Genexus regarding sequencing limits, and the quality of variant typing and cluster analysis is shown. Followed by the application of NGS in examining the cause of N-gene dropout and N-gene shift results in the  diagnostic Allplex 2019-nCOV real-time PCR assay. In addition to the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays, the role of NGS in the investigation of the cause of 14 vaccine breakthrough infection cases is demonstrated.

Om meer inzicht te krijgen in de relatie tussen tekstkwaliteit en de verschillende soorten kennis over schrijven is de tekstkwaliteit van adviesbrieven van eerste- en vierdeklassers onderzocht. 43 leerlingen uit een havo-brugklas en een 4-havoklas hebben een adviesbrief geschreven met adviezen over schrijven. De brieven zijn beoordeeld en de adviezen zijn geanalyseerd. Hiermee is indirect de kennis van de leerlingen gemeten. Naast de kwaliteit van de brieven en het type kennis over schrijven is onderzocht of een relatie aangetoond kon worden tussen de kwaliteit van de brieven en het type kennis van de leerlingen. De brieven van vierdeklassers waren gemiddeld beter dan die van eersteklassers, maar er kan geen verschil in kennis aangetoond worden tussen leerlingen van beide leerjaren. Voor vierdeklassers is er een relatie aangetoond tussen tekstkwaliteit en lagere- en hogere-ordekennis, kennis over gedrag en kennis over hulpbronnen. Op basis van de verwachtingen van dit onderzoek, is de bevinding dat de relatie tussen hogere-ordekennis en tekstkwaliteit aanwezig is het belangrijkst. Het lijkt zinvol om het schrijfonderwijs meer te richten op het vergroten van dit type kennis. Daarnaast moeten leerlingen ondersteuning krijgen in hoe ze moeten schrijven, om te kunnen schrijven."

Het beleidsmatige uitgangspunt draait om de vraag welke capaciteiten de overheid van burgers veronderstelt om toegang te krijgen tot en gebruik te maken van het beleid. In dit onderzoek worden de veronderstelde capaciteiten vergeleken met de daadwerkelijke capaciteiten van een belangrijke beleidsdoelgroep in het rechtsbijstandsstelsel: kwetsbare burgers met verminderd denk- en doenvermogen.

Om een antwoord te formuleren op de hoofdvraag is wetenschappelijk onderzoek verricht middels documentanalyses en kwalitatieve interviews met politici, ambtenaren, sociaal advocaten en burgers. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat er een zekere discrepantie lijkt te bestaan tussen de veronderstelde en daadwerkelijke capaciteiten van burgers om toegang te krijgen tot het gefinancierde rechtsbijstandsstelsel. Door deze discrepantie bestaat het risico dat burgers die in aanmerking komen voor gefinancierde rechtsbijstand bij hun geschil, dit niet krijgen en zo tussen wal en schip belanden.

De bevindingen van dit onderzoek dragen bij aan de wetenschappelijke kennis over beleidsmatige uitgangspunten, de rol van kwetsbare burgers en de interactie tussen deze concepten in de praktijk. Het onderzoek levert daarnaast aanknopingspunten voor vervolgonderzoek op het beleidsterrein van het gefinancierde rechtsbijstandsstelsel en andere beleidsterreinen.

Dit onderzoek levert inzicht in weeffouten die de discrepantie binnen het rechtsbijstandsstelsel in de hand werken. Op basis van deze weeffouten doet dit onderzoek twee aanbevelingen om de verhouding tussen de veronderstelde en daadwerkelijke capaciteiten van burgers te verbeteren:

Aanbeveling 1: Het versterken van de eerste lijn rechtshulp:
In dit onderzoek is gebleken dat de huidige vormgeving van de eerste lijn rechtshulp hoge drempels opwerpt voor kwetsbare burgers om toegang te krijgen tot het gefinancierde rechtsbijstandsstelsel. Praktisch wordt aanbevolen om de eerste lijn te versterken door het aantal juridisch loketten uit te breiden, de openingstijden van het loket te verbreden, het beltarief af te schaffen en het takenpakket van het juridisch loket te verdiepen en te verbreden. Het doel is om burgers in een vroeg stadium adequaat te voorzien van hulp bij hun juridische probleem en daardoor escalatie van het probleem te voorkomen.

Aanbeveling 2: Het verkleinen van de actie- en keuzearchitectuur van burgers:
In dit onderzoek is gebleken dat burgers veel zelfredzame acties moeten ondernemen om toegang tot het rechtsbijstandsstelsel te krijgen, wat in veel gevallen niet lukt. Het verkleinen van de actie- en keuzearchitectuur komt tegemoet aan de verminderd zelfredzame capaciteiten van kwetsbare burgers en zorgt voor een betere verhouding tussen de veronderstelde en daadwerkelijke capaciteiten van burgers. Praktisch wordt aanbevolen om de actie- en keuzearchitectuur te verkleinen door het experiment om burgers te verplichten zelfstandig hun aanvraag voor een toevoeging te doen niet uit te voeren. Daarnaast wordt aanbevolen om de mogelijkheid te creëren dat het juridisch loket namens burgers een toevoeging of een RATZ-regeling aanvraagt."

As the use of hydrological models to simulate water availability over large regions of the world becomes feasible, establishing methods to turn model output into actionable insights is necessary. The use of globally available open data for drought hazard assessment based on hydrological models enables scientists and water managers to better understand how cities are affected by drought, regardless of the economic resources available to achieve this. Using metrics directly derived from hydrological model output makes it possible to maintain a high level of automation (and consistency) across cases, even when large samples of cities are assessed. In this thesis, I propose an automated approach to measure drought hazard at a city scale using a global hydrological model, apply it to four cities located in different regions, and assess the extent to which the approach can reproduce city-specific urban drought occurrences recorded in literature and a climate incident database. Results show that the approach can replicate most urban droughts reported in literature in the case study cities; however, several modelled droughts did not match drought incident records of a global database. This research expands existing hazard assessment methods by offering a fully automated approach to measure drought severity, frequency, and persistence based on modelled water storage. Additionally, it points out the practical challenges in determining thresholds for drought in cities. The developed approach can be used to achieve an initial understanding of the current drought hazard any city faces, and it sets the ground for hydrological model-driven assessment of future drought hazard in cities."
Understanding the role of banks in overcoming financial barriers to agroecological transitions from a systems thinking perspective.,"['Hollywood, Jamie']","['Runhaar, Hens']",2022-09-28T23:00:31Z,EN,[],Sustainable Development,"Intensive agricultural practices have contributed to global sustainability challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, soil degradation, food insecurity and groundwater pollution (Skaalsveen et al., 2019; El Bilali & Allahyari, 2018; Xu et al., 2018; Leip et al., 2015; Postel, 2000). Agroecology, a pathway to “green” agriculture through the application of ecological principles, has been proposed to increase the sustainability of food- systems and agriculture (Gliessman, 2018). The problem central to this research is that financial barriers hinder systemic transition of agriculture towards agroecology (Anibaldi et al., 2021). The financial barriers established in the literature are insufficient economic (dis)incentives, lacking transition funds, and limited access to finance (Vermunt et al., 2022). This research seeks to understand what practical solutions or innovations can be implemented by banks to overcome these barriers, and gain insights as to the systematic transformation potential of banks towards agroecological transitions. To do this, two banks were selected, Rabobank and Triodos, and key stakeholder groups therein were identified. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and analysed to establish existing and proposed solutions to the financial barriers. The Motivation, Capability, Implementation and Results (MCIR) framework was subsequently employed to analyse the adoption of solutions and innovations within the banks (Chai & Yeo, 2012). Comparative analysis of the banks resulted in inter-organisational and field-wide learning opportunities. The analysis identified 19 solutions and innovations across both banks, 10 within Rabobank, and 9 within Triodos. There were substantial differences in the solutions of the banks, attributed to differences in organisational form, values and principles, and bank size. Through implementation of the MCIR framework, shortfalls in overcoming the systemic barriers within the banks were established."

to improve water and food security, and to increase biodiversity. Because of
positive feedback loops between vegetation and precipitation, regreening has the potential
to lead to the restoration of local and regional water cycles. However, in arid
and hyper-arid regions, the amount of available rainwater is not sufficient to sustain
the initial stages of regreening. A technology that uses solar energy to evaporate
seawater may be able to enhance convective rainfall. The main research question is:
Can evaporation through technology potentially be used for water cycle restoration
in arid and hyper-arid regions?
Using atmospheric boundary layer theories as described by Stull (1988), a simple
atmospheric column model was developed and coupled to a surface model with a
dynamic vegetation component. Results of sensitivity analyses with this numerical
model show the importance of atmospheric conditions and it is found that evaporation
through technology has the potential to be effective in regions with a relatively
moist and cold atmosphere. Regions that satisfy these conditions and also have a
dry soil are mostly found 25-35°N near coasts and/or in mountainous areas.
One such area is the Sinai Peninsula. Numerical simulations using ERA5 reanalysis
data as boundary conditions show that the evaporation technology can increase
precipitation locally, but this increase is small. However, because of the wind directed
southward and up the mountain range of South Sinai, the technology has the
potential to cause precipitation non-locally as well as is shown by simulations where
the atmospheric column is moved along a streamline.
In conclusion, enhanced evaporation through technology has the potential to be
used for regreening projects if atmospheric conditions are favorable. However, more
research is needed and the potential adverse effects, such as warming, need to be
taken into consideration."

To unpack how knowledges are constructed in aquaculture and delta management in the two deltas, a qualitative study was conducted, inspired by Actor-Network Theory and rooted in a process of co-creation with co-researchers in India and Vietnam. This involved studying how actors that work on aquaculture/delta management, at various levels of governance, understand and frame salinity, by historicizing aquaculture developments in the two deltas and analyzing six sub-cases which highlight key controversies revolving around salinity.

The results of this study firstly indicate that, historically, the desire to promote shrimp aquaculture has been a manifestation of a global policy push and business interests and that these business interests continue to shape aquaculture, delta management and elite framings of salinity. The analysis of the sub-cases shows that in professionals’ framings of salinity, the diverse salinity realities of other actors are reduced into one particular form of salinity, often expressed as a single line on a map or a single ‘problematic’ concentration of salt. This suggests that policy level framings of salinity in both deltas are reductive and do not sufficiently reflect the diversity of salinity understandings and framings of actors at the ground level. The reduction of the diverse salinity realities into one dominant narrative facilitates and legitimizes the development of brackish water aquaculture and hydraulic structures, which conflicts with the interests of many actors at the ground level and can feed into inequities. This suggests that specific knowledge systems at the policy level shape aquaculture/delta management in the two deltas and render it technical and apolitical. This thesis therefore concludes with the recommendation for future practitioners to be more open-minded, modest, reflexive and embrace interdisciplinarity in rethinking the management of associated sustainability problems."
Enhancing multi-level collaborations to upscale short food supply chains in Utrecht,"['Jeandrain, Lucie']","['Dermody, Brian']",2022-10-01T00:01:10Z,EN,['Short Food Supply Chains; Local Food System; Collaborative Ecosystems; Upscaling;'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The global food system is in dire need of reform. How we produce and consume food contributes to some of society's most pressing challenges. As a reaction, short food supply chains (SFSCs) have developed in Europe, supported by the idea of producing and consuming food in a way that respects both the environment and the different actors in the food chain. Utrecht, the fourth biggest city in the Netherlands, is also following that trend, and many initiatives that seek to offer fresh and local food to citizens have arisen. Nevertheless, this alternative system remains relatively small compared to the conventional value chains. This thesis examines how SFSCs of Utrecht can be upscaled through the creation of meaningful collaborations while still respecting the primary identity of SFSCs i.e., small and local. The acceleration mechanisms of Gorissen, Spira, Meynaerts, Valkeringa, & Frantzeskaki (2018) are adapted and then combined in a novel conceptual framework with the concepts of transformative alliances and actors of Haan & Rotmans (2018) and the different collaboration levels offered by Mittal, White, & Krejci (2017). This framework highlights the way different types of actors are creating transformative alliances to foster system change. These theories are then visualised using social network concepts which allowed for a thorough overview of the different actors collaborating to strengthen SFSCs in Utrecht. Based on these observations, recommendations on how to strengthen SFSCs are formulated. These are mainly focused on connectors and topplers who appeared to be critical actors in unifying, assembling, and giving relevance to SFSCs and later upscale SFSCs.
The results help to further define how upscaling processes occur within a local context. The research offers a new narrative on how alternative markets such as SFSCs are being developed by creating meaningful collaborations between diverse actors. Moreover, the methodology suggests a novel and concrete way to visualise how actors are coming together to challenge and modify the conventional systems. It is believed that these findings could be applied in similar regions where SFSCs evolve to then further develop the conceptual framework created."
Scaling impact of grassroots initiatives for sustainability within food policy councils,"['Fiore, Francesca']","['Feola, Giuseppe']",2022-10-01T23:00:31Z,EN,[],Sustainable Development,"As civil societies increasingly acknowledge sustainability challenges, sustainability transition (ST) studies have investigated more and more the role of grassroots organisations in triggering scalable change. Attempts to frame such topics have focused particularly on the innovative contribution of grassroots innovations and developed analytical models to identify their scaling strategies. More specifically, upscaling, out-scaling, and capture models have been developed. However, as effective outcomes have proven to be hard to identify, ways in which grassroots organisations exert influence at a larger scale are still under investigation and needing of more empirical application.  
The current study employs the aforementioned models, integrating them with another diverse body of literature on social movements and constituent power. Consequently, the notion of grassroots initiatives for sustainability (GISs) is used as an umbrella term to avoid constraining the scope to specific theoretical paradigm, and leaving the doors open for unexplored contributions.
The units of analysis are GISs scaling through food policy councils (FPCs) in two city-regions: Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Lucca, Italy. By conducting an Event-Structure-Analysis (ESA), the research reconstructs the history of the formation of the FPCs with particular attention to GISs’ roles.  The aim is ultimately to discover how GISs scale their impact through platforms fostering interactions among multiple stakeholders. The results show that GISs exerted remarkable influence by taking different and evolving roles over time. Primarily alternating collaborative, activist and strategic tactics, depending on the context and institutional support. Although in various forms, the role of the political agency of grassroots initiatives proves essential for GISs' scaling in both case studies, suggesting a necessity to integrate more political conceptualizations into ST research. 
Considering these results, the present research finally proposes a nuanced interpretative spectrum integrating and reformulating the above-mention models, with specific emphasis on the political contribution of GISs."

With less focus on documentation and more focus on developing working software, documentation tends to be overlooked. In this research, we sought to address the challenges found in documentation by exploring the impact of Agile RE activities on the documentation in multi-team software projects. We conduct documentation analyses and eight semi-structured interviews with experts from two multi-team Agile Software Development (ASD) projects. The findings address the variations

in how ASD is adopted at scale and the RE activities that are embedded in these practices as well as the documentation artefacts used. We identify the challenges and strengths facing the documentation artefacts and the documentation processes within the teams. Previous studies on software process initiatives address process improvement in agile teams but hardly address the issues found in the documentation.

Therefore, we propose the DIFFC model, a lightweight treatment that focuses on the strengths of feedback within agile teams. Our model is validated via an experiment in two multi-team software projects. As a first step, the results are promising with potential for improvement in future research. Our treatment may assist practitioners in addressing the issues found in their documentation and improving their documentation processes."
Impacts of freshwater salinity levels on crop productivity in agricultural river basins in the United States.,"['Cunningham, Andrew']","['Vliet, Michelle van']",2022-10-02T23:00:33Z,EN,['Salinity; Crop Production; Watersheds; North Dakota; Water Quality; Middle Sheyenne; Forest Watershed'],Earth Surface and Water,"Freshwater salinisation is an increasing global concern as it is a major factor which contributes 
to reductions in crop yields. Investigating the impacts of salinisation on crop productivity and 
monitoring the current levels of salinity in agricultural basins is crucial to ensure the prevention 
of yield declines.
The Great-Plains is one of the most important agricultural regions in the United States and vital 
to the nation’s economy. In recent years challenging environmental conditions in the Great 
Plains coupled with land-use change has increased the risk of salinisation and sodification and 
these patterns have been studied. Few studies have investigated exceedance salinity thresholds 
for different crop types and estimated loss of crops within the Great Plains of the United States.
There can be great insight in synthesising surface water, groundwater and soil salinity data with 
crop data and conducting analysis on a watershed level. Therefore, the objective of this thesis 
is to investigate spatiotemporal trends in salinity levels, its relation to crop specific salinity 
threshold exceedances and potential crop losses in a selection of agricultural watersheds in 
North Dakota over the last two decades. The results of statistical tests such as Mann-Kendall 
and Wilcoxon-Sign tests show that surface water salinity tends to increase a considerable 
amount downstream, even at a watershed scale, and increased from 2001-2020. Furthermore, 
crop salinity threshold analysis shows that over the past decade, a greater number of crop salt 
tolerance thresholds have been surpassed. Synthesis of crop acreage data and crop salinity 
threshold data showed the maximum potential production of dry beans – a saline sensitive crop 
– is impacted by temporal trend of increasing salinity. This thesis also elaborates on salinity 
management measures utilised within the study region and possible solutions to the increase in 
salinity."

For this study, data from an online survey on political ideology, scientific trust, anxieties, and knowledge related to COVID-19 was used. Findings showed that important antecedents of COVID-19 scepticism were COVID-19 related knowledge and age. In addition, the effect of COVID-19 related knowledge on COVID-19 scepticism was especially strong for young participants. Based on these findings, it is concluded that COVID-19 scepticism relates most to GMO scepticism.

It is crucial to investigate whether parenting practices are effective to reduce children’s social media use and which mechanisms may intervene in the relationship between them. In our paper, we will focus whether children’s self-control mediates the relationship between (parental) restrictive mediation and children’s intense social media use. Furthermore, we tried to depict if active mediation in addition to restrictive mediation contributed to children’s social media use. Methods: Children aged between 9-18 years old (N=404) completed 4 questionnaires as being the Reactive Restrictions Scale, Parenting Style inventory II, Self-control Scale and Intensity of Social Media Use Scale in an online environment. To test the mediation effect of children’s self-control between restrictive mediation and children’s social media use, we conducted multiple regression analysis using Baron and Kenny’s (1986) statistical method. Also, to see active mediation’s contribution on children’s social media use, we conducted hierarchical regression analysis. Results: We concluded that children’s self-control partially mediates the relationship between restrictive mediation and children’s social media use, also, we observed that active mediation could not significantly contribute to the children’s social media use next to restrictive mediation. Discussion: Our results contradicted what the self-control theory argued (Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990) and demonstrated that the higher children are exposed to restrictive mediation, the lesser self-control they would have. Moreover, it is important to present that when parental restrictive mediation increases, children use more social media which indicates the strict parenting rules might not help to decrease children’s social media use. Even though we could not find a significant effect of active mediation next to restrictive mediation, for the future researches, looking to the main effect of it would be valuable."

Mechanotransduction pathways play a critical role to mediate mechanical load-induced myocardial remodeling, whereby the morphology and function of cardiomyocytes and the extracellular matrix are altered, resulting in changes in cardiac function. Mechanical loading not only governs the function of the adult heart but is also responsible for normal morphogenesis of the cardiovascular system during prenatal development. In this review, the role of mechanical load in development, health, and disease are highlighted. First, how mechanical load governs the development of the heart from a primitive heart tube to a functional organ, its role in the maturation of the vasculature, as well as the mechanisms which control load-induced cardiac alterations in the adult heart during exercise and pregnancy are discussed. Subsequently, the mechanisms that contribute to mechanical load-induced pathologic cardiac remodeling are underlined. Mechanical overloading of the heart due to pressure or volume cause different alterations in cardiac structure and function which lead to heart failure. These differences translate to differences in disease phenotype that are reflected on pressure-volume loops. Next, the therapeutic interventions for mechanical load-induced heart failure are explored with a focus on mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices. Insights into the various types and function of these devices, as well as the mechanical unloading-induced mechanisms that contribute to reverse remodeling are provided. Finally, the current in vivo and in vitro models of mechanical loading and unloading are presented. These models have allowed for various discoveries in the field of cardiac mechanobiology. However, although significant advances have been made in our knowledge of the function of cardiac mechanical load, several mechanisms underlying cardiac mechanical properties, load-induced pathologic remodeling, and unloading-induced reverse remodeling remain unexplored. Thus, future advancements of in vivo and in vitro models are necessary to fill the gaps in our current understanding of myocardial mechanical properties, mechanotransduction, and reverse remodeling."

Methods: In-dept semi-structured interviews were performed by asking questions about researchers’
perspective on sex and gender differences in medical research, obstacles in different research phases,
as well as enrollment and retention strategies. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed
verbatim. Results: Researchers reported being aware of the importance of including sex and gender

strategies. There were strategies implemented by certain medical departments that were more
successful than others. However, some researchers noted no activate strategies to overcome obstacles.
Overall, my results matched prior literature. Conclusions: this study highlights the knowledge gaps
that are still present in research regarding the enrollment and retention of women in medical research.
To close the gap and guarantee better outcomes and health to all sexes and genders multiple strategies
must be activated. All stakeholders need to collaborate to achieve a common goal: equality in female

Rechten van cliënten worden geschonden door het gebruik van ongelimiteerde vrijheidsbeperkende maatregelen. Echter, blijkt het terugdringen van de inzet van vrijheidsbeperkende maatregelen een complex proces. De druk op de zorg neemt toe, waardoor de zoektocht naar alternatieve zorgmaatregelen wordt gestagneerd. Om de inzet van vrijheidsbeperkende zorgmaatregelen en onvrijwillige zorg terug te dringen, is noodzakelijk dat bewustwording en kennisoverdracht worden verhoogd. 
Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te achterhalen hoe de gehandicaptensector onvrijwillige zorg kan terugdringen en vrijwillige zorg kan stimuleren. Hiervoor is een onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: In hoeverre kan de kans op een onvrijwillige zorgmaatregel van de Wet zorg en dwang bij volwassenen met een verstandelijke beperking worden verklaard door individuele cliënt kenmerken? Op basis van dit resultaat kan een risicoprofiel worden samengesteld die gebruikt kan worden het terugdringen van onvrijwillige zorgmaatregelen. 
Om de onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden zijn verschillende analyses uitgevoerd met informatie uit het administratiebestand van de Wet zorg en dwang binnen de Stichting Zozijn. De participanten zijn cliënten die zorg ontvangen, meerderjarig zijn en waarvan individuele cliëntkenmerken zoals mate van beperking, sekse en leeftijd bekend zijn. Uit de analyses bleek dat de grootste voorspeller voor de kans op een onvrijwillige zorgmaatregel versus vrijwillige zorgmaatregel de mate van beperking is. Hoe zwaarder de mate van beperking, hoe groter de kans op een onvrijwillige zorgmaatregel. Dit duidt erop dat de zwaarte van de beperking invloed heeft op de vrijwilligheid van zorgmaatregelen. 
Op basis van deze resultaten wordt aanbevolen om in het terugdringen van onvrijwillige zorgmaatregelen de cliëntendoelgroep met een zwaardere mate van beperking als aandachtgroep te nemen. Eventueel vervolgonderzoek zou zich kunnen richten op de mechanismes en trends in andere organisaties binnen de gezondheidssector omtrent de Wet zorg en dwang."

This is especially relevant as the Dutch government has over time been investing more and more in deprived neighbourhoods in order to tackle social issues. In context of the participation society, the government expects residents to be active within their own community. Therefore, they involve neighbourhood initiatives and its active residents to help tackle such social issues. We know that areas hit by urban renewal programs, such as the Empowered Neighbourhoods Program, are afterwards seen as flourishing. The Indische buurt in Amsterdam is such a neighbourhood and both seen by the council of Amsterdam as well as its residents as a neighbourhood to be proud of. However, what we do not know is what exactly happens to the neighbourhood as a renewal program ends and less resources are once more available. This paper will look at this specifically within the context of people owning or active within a neighbourhood initiative. What role do they play within their community? How do they relate to each other? What behaviour do they show? A qualitative ethnographic fieldwork study was conducted in order to ascertain how these active participants shape the Indische buurt after the Empowered Neighbourhoods Program finishes. Merton’s Strain Theory and Agnew’s General Strain Theory were used to get an understanding of the field and its active participants. This paper will show that certain people have more opportunities for being successfully active within the neighbourhood. Next to personal consequences, such as being excluded, feeling unvalued and experiencing competition, on a bigger scale this leads to division within the neighbourhood and less faith in local authorities. These consequences are contrary to the councils social policies for the neighbourhood."

The influence of gender role beliefs on HIV testing behaviour amongst South African men, and the interaction effect of race","['Brown, Taylor']","['Ditzhuijzen, J.M. van']",2022-10-08T00:01:30Z,EN,[],Social Policy and Public Health,"In South Africa, men remain disproportionately unreached for HIV testing and treatment compared to their female counterparts, and other men who have sex with men. This gap becomes more evident when looking at the different ethnic groups, where HIV prevalence and risk is higher amongst Black/African men. Existing research highlighted colonial and Apartheid past on ideals of masculinity, and how this manifests between different racial groups. This thesis explores the relationship between gender beliefs and HIV testing behaviour and examines the moderator of race. Using constructionist gender, postcolonial, and intersectionality theory, this thesis posits that the segregated past of South Africa has resulted in a socially hierarchical structure of masculinity, enacted through daily decisions that affect men’s health. Multiple logistic regression was performed to test the predictor of gender role beliefs, followed by a second multiple logistic regression model to examine the interaction effects of race. Gender beliefs were not significantly predictive of HIV testing behaviour (p = .207) when compared with more commonly studied variables, such as financial means (p <.001), employment year-round (p = .039), and being divorced (p = .033). Main effects and moderator analysis were conducted. Race was a significant interaction effect in the relationship between gender role beliefs and HIV testing behaviour relating to recent testing. This was observed with the change in Wald Chi-square changing between main effects (398.624, p = .000) and interaction effects (16.426, p = .170). This resulted in a rejection of the initial hypothesis, revealing that gender role beliefs, as approximated in this thesis, do not outweigh the statistical significance of common predictors. Race as a moderator aligns with theories of postcolonialism and intersectionality. This thesis concludes with recommendations of future research elaborating on the interaction effects of race, and to focused on human-centred design when implementing interventions."

The factors influencing the division of care responsibilities between parents 
have previously been studied. With the improvement in women’s economic position and the 
change in traditional gender norms, the question is whether these factors remain present in 
today’s society. This study examines the relationship between Dutch parents' educational 
level and their division in care tasks, by examining the impact of gender norms and income 
inequality of Dutch parents. Method. This research is based on quantitative data from the 
LISS data archive (N=196). Multiple regressions were performed to test the relation between 
level of education and the division in care tasks. A positive effect of level of education on the 
division in care tasks was expected. Gender norms were expected to function as a mediator 
and inequality in income were expected as a moderator. Results. Parents with a higher levels 
of education have more liberal gender norms that cause them to share work and care more 
equally compared to parents with lower levels of education. A direct relation between 
education level and the division of caregiving tasks was not found, nor was the influence of 
income inequality on the distribution of caregiving tasks. Conclusion. Current gender norms 
affect how Dutch parents divide work and care. This is in line with earlier research showing 
that the strong care culture in the Netherlands is very decisive. This research indicates the 
need to develop interventions that question and criticize traditional gender norms in order to 
strive for more equal opportunities and less financial dependence for women."

Shaping the changing landscape of clinical evidence: a multi-stakeholder perspective on the feasibility of a pay-for-proof pricing model for improved access to innovative drugs in the Netherlands,"['Brinkhuis, Francine']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-10-20T00:00:40Z,EN,['Patient access; market access; reimbursement; oncology; cancer; drug regulation; managed entry agreement; value-based healthcare; personalized healthcare'],Drug Innovation,"After a novel drug has obtained market authorization in the EU, decisions must be made on a national level
regarding the reimbursement of the treatment. This process is often informed by Health Technology
Assessment (HTA) agencies, who are responsible for assessing the effects of the treatment in the context
of a specific healthcare system. In these assessments, HTA agencies aim to shed light on the relative
effectiveness of the drug in comparison to the therapy that is generally applied to quantify its added
therapeutic value. Due to tight healthcare budgets and increasing expenditures, making well-informed
reimbursement decisions is becoming increasingly important.

The randomized controlled trial (RCT) is a study design that is often considered the gold standard,
as directly comparing the effects of a newly proposed therapy against an existing treatment in one single
study provides the highest level of evidence. However, several trends are ongoing that result in a growing
number of drugs being developed through study types that deviate from the traditional RCT design. The
lack of strong comparative evidence in these study designs hampers an adequate assessment on the
relative effectiveness of treatments. Ultimately, this results in significantly delayed patient access or even
no access at all.

Payment models have the potential to manage uncertainties that are associated with a drug
through flexible agreements regarding its reimbursement. The objective of this study was to assess the
feasibility of an innovative pay-for-proof (PFP) payment model and contribute to its development,
ultimately advising Roche Nederland B.V. whether the Dutch healthcare system is ready for the
implementation of payment models that aim at improving access to drugs associated with new types of
evidence. In the PFP model, the price of a drug is based on data obtained through clinical trials as well as
the growing data from real-world practice, in which higher levels of evidence are rewarded by declining
discounts, thereby reflecting the real-world value of innovations.

Interviews were conducted with internal and external stakeholders of Roche. Results indicated
that stakeholders believe current reimbursement procedures are not sustainable, whereas the PFP model
was perceived as a fair and robust alternative that enhances flexible reimbursement and enables reflection
of the real-world value of innovations. Main challenges include complex methodologies associated with
real-world data and the need for a solid data-infrastructure. Further, the differential pricing used in the
PFP scheme may possibly result in resistance due to perceived unfairness.

For successful implementation of the PFP scheme in the Netherlands, several recommendations
were made. First, (1) ensure the scheme is easy executable for medical specialists. Further, (2) make use
of an existing data-infrastructure instead of developing a new platform. Next, (3) propagate the highest
price as reference price and clearly link discounts to specific conditions to justify differential pricing. More,
(4) before engaging in the scheme, define which uncertainties remain and always ensure a link between
these uncertainties and the conditions applied in the scheme. Last, (5) ensure active involvement of
relevant stakeholders during implementation of the PFP model. Hence, the PFP model contributes to
Roche’s Pharma Vision 2030 to achieve 3-5 times more patient benefits for 50% less costs to society."
Environmental Impact Assessment of Transport Infrastructure Transformation Projects: A Case Study of the Utrecht Science Park,"['Vermaas, Benthe']","['Rosales Carreon, Jesus']",2022-10-20T00:00:33Z,EN,[],Energy Science,"Keeping urban areas accessible and attractive under the stress of population growth, while also facilitating the mitigation of climate change and achieving climate goals, is an urgent and complicated challenge. The Utrecht Science Park (USP) currently faces this challenge, having made plans to transform its transport infrastructure. Consequentially, this study aims to develop a model that can assess the environmental impact of the USP transport infrastructure transformation project and that provides an evaluation of possible mitigation measures. Following the methodological steps of environmental impact assessment, the Transport Infrastructure Project Environmental Assessment (TIPEA) model was developed. The TIPEA model uses life cycle assessment as a supportive tool to provide a holistic environmental assessment. The TIPEA model has three transformation phases incorporated: the construction, use and demolition phase. In addition to most studies, the use phase includes passenger displacement. Furthermore, the TIPEA model has the ability to compare the environmental impact of two system boundaries. The system boundaries examined are passenger displacement on USP grounds (B1) and commute displacement (B2).
The application of the TIPEA model to the USP transformation project has led to two important conclusions. First, the original plans have the ability to reduce the environmental impact of the USP. Depending on the chosen system boundary, the embodied environmental impact of the transformation on the global warming potential is paid back within 9.5 years (B1) or 13.3 years (B2). However, this is not in time to facilitate the aim of the Utrecht University to reach climate neutrality in 2030. Therefore, the environmental impact must be reduced further to reach this aim. Second, as the use phase contributes to up to 67.5% (B1) or even up to 99% (B2) of the global warming potential, it has a significant effect on the environmental impact of the project and a high mitigation potential.
To reduce the environmental impact of the USP transformation project, the effect of three mitigation measures has been studied: inducing a modal shift in passenger displacement, using alternative asphalt road surface layers and constructing an alternative type of parking garages. All three possible mitigation measures have the potential to mitigate the environmental impact of the project. However, the extent to which these measures mitigate the environmental impact varies significantly between the measures and is greatly dependent on the chosen system boundary. Thereby, the results highlight the importance of setting proper system boundary conditions and climate goals in order to effectively mitigate climate change."

To better understand what a mood playlist is, I have theorized different aspects which are of importance when it comes to the mood playlist in a theoretical framework. First of all, I am discussing what a mood is and how moods are influenced. While moods are mostly influenced through emotions, which in turn can be aroused and perceived through music, aesthetics play an important role as well. This is because they function as a contextualization or adjective of the mood in a mood playlist. Secondly, I am explaining the characteristics of a playlist through a history of the playlist. Through doing this, I reveal the playlist’s characteristics as well as from which medium they are inherited. The third part of the theoretical framework contextualizes the listening side of affective mood regulation. This includes a discussion on the changing role of music in everyday life as well as new listening modes and a comparison to the Muzak corporation. To show how these mood-regulating processes work in practice, I have conducted a case study wherein I analyse a mood playlist. This analysis largely consists of three parts. The first shows how the aesthetic is featured throughout the playlist, the second is a general discussion of the playlist's musical properties and the third discusses four mechanisms of emotional arousal that potentially lead to the theorized mood."
"Skewed Selective Acquisition: Sampling Bias in Active Learning and its Influence on Operational Classification

Performance","['Flesher-Clark, Alec']","['Krempl, G.M.']",2022-10-20T00:00:46Z,EN,['Active Learning; Machine Learning; Class Imbalance; Sample Selection Bias; Classification'],Artificial Intelligence,"Active learning aims to provide supervised learning models with highly informative and succinct data, but can also introduce sampling bias as the resulting labelled dataset often no longer follows the original data distribution. Due to sampling bias, the training data no longer represents the environment that the model will operate in, which can either be harmful or helpful to classifier performance. One form of sampling bias is class bias, where the labelled dataset no longer follows the class distribution of the population data. Through experimenting on 15 different binary-classification datasets, this thesis studied active learning sampling bias through class bias and its relation to operational classification performance.

First, this thesis investigated four main factors in the active learning cycle that might influence active learning sampling bias in labelled training data. The chosen factors were the choice of active learning algorithm, machine learning classifier, the level of class imbalance in the unlabelled data pool and the class ratio of the initial training set. All factors had an effect on sampling bias and on classifier performance, with varying degrees of severity. The level of class imbalance had the largest influence on active learning algorithms introducing more sampling bias.

Afterwards, various experiments were conducted using three active learning debiasing methods: hierarchical sampling, QUerying Informative and Representative Instances (QUIRE) and Active Learning By Learning (ALBL).  These query strategies were compared in terms of trained classifier performance and sampling bias mitigation. In these experiments, utilizing informative-based query strategies like uncertainty sampling led to the highest amount of sampling bias but also the highest performance. While the three debiasing methods resulted in less sampling bias in the labelled dataset, they were generally outperformed by uncertainty sampling. Of these methods, hierarchical sampling performed the best, achieving a performance which was marginally worse than uncertainty sampling. These results suggest that using active learning algorithms that introduce sampling bias can boost performance, especially in high class imbalance situations. However, careful consideration should be taken before implementing more sampling bias introducing active learning algorithms. In cases where sampling bias in training data is harmful, either by raising issues of fairness or by yielding a shortsighted classifier, using a well-performing but more representative-based active learning method like hierarchical sampling or density-weighted sampling is recommended."
The notions of ownership of NFTs in virtual economy of metaverse as presented by Mark Zuckerberg,"['Shah, Noreen']","['Vries, Imar de']",2022-10-19T00:00:43Z,EN,['NFTs; ownership; metaverse; Mark Zuckerberg; virtual objects'],New Media and Digital Culture,"When Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook's shift to Meta last year, it was a surprising move in the technology world. With possibilities to virtually connect all facets of life, including work, play, learning, and more, Zuckerberg's metaverse promises a true sense of presence in a virtual environment. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will play a vital part in the metaverse by serving as legal records of digital ownership to validate virtual goods and services. The ownership of virtual objects in the form of NFTs is unlike prior digital and virtual items due to their enhanced legality and exclusivity. The research used textual analysis to examine how Twitter users make sense of NFT ownership by assessing their views, fears, and speculations surrounding owning NFTs. The findings of this thesis reveal the multifaceted nature of ownership of NFTs. NFT ownership is characterized by low object awareness, ambiguous legal rights, and a perceived lack of control in the case of some NFTs. However, they are likely to become desirable status symbols in the metaverse due to their high self-investment nature, satisfying various utilities."

The Effect of Deep Learning-based Source Separation on Predominant Instrument Classification in Polyphonic Music,"['Ligtenberg, Diego']","['Kranenburg, P. van']",2022-10-20T00:00:49Z,EN,"['music instrument classification, music source separation, deep learning, autoencoder, convolutional neural network, multilabel classification']",Artificial Intelligence,"Music instrument classification is the task of detecting individual music instruments in music tracks.
It remains a challenging task, particularly in polyphonic music. Prior research has shown that
analytical-based music source separation can increase the performance of instrument classification.
Music source separation is the art of extracting isolated instrument groups called stems from music
tracks. We propose a novel deep learning-based source separation model in the time-frequency
domain that learns to generate a combination of the ’vocals and other’ stems. Additionally, we
develop a postprocessing algorithm that increases the subjective performance of these stems. We
also compare the objective performance between these raw and postprocessed stems and measure
which of the stems positively impacts instrument classification. We find that only the postprocessed
stems positively impact the performance of instrument classification. In addition, we perform
instrument-wise analysis to examine which classified instruments are most affected by music source
separation. We find that the cello, clarinet, piano and violin were the only instruments that
were positively impacted. This research confirms the importance of the source-separated stem’s
quality. The instrument-wise analysis gives insights into which instruments benefit most from
source separation and what source separation quality improvements are needed to increase the
performance of instrument classification."
Predicting diagnoses of patients in the Emergency Room: a multi-label text classification approach,"[""Hart, Hanna 't""]","['Mosteiro Romero, Pablo']",2022-10-20T00:00:48Z,EN,['Multilabel Classification; Natural Language processing; BERT; Sequence-to-sequence; Deep learning; Medical Language Processing; Electronic Health Records; Emergency Room'],Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have big potential in the medical domain because there is so much data available.

This thesis aims to build an AI model that predicts diagnoses of patients from the History of Present Illness (HPI) text, to support clinicians in the Emergency Room (ER). The implementation of such a model can be of help to reduce diagnostic errors, and lower the workload of clinicians in the ER. No previous work has tried to make a predictive model for diagnoses, that can support clinicians in the ER, based on Dutch HPI texts that is explainable as well. A multi-label dataset with more than 120,000 HPI texts with corresponding diagnosis labels was used to train a simple baseline model and three deep learning models, including a sequence-tosequence model and two BERT-based models, to compare to each other. After testing and evaluating the models by F1 score, it was found that none of the models achieve high performance on the whole dataset. Interestingly, the two BERT-based models did achieve high performances when trained on smaller samples of the dataset, consisting of diagnoses that are more difficult for clinicians to distinguish. Therefore, it is proposed to further research this idea of more specific models, to support clinicians to make a decision between more specific diagnoses."

"Admitting Totality, The Individual Approach of Ladislav Čemický to Stalinist Socialist Realism (1949-1956)","['Ostatníková, Kristína']","['Troelenberg, Eva']",2022-07-23T00:02:48Z,EN,['socialist realism; Stalinism; Ladislav Čemický; totalitarian art; artistic identity; propaganda; Slovak art; post-colonialism; socialist realist art; socialist realist painitng;'],Art History,"This thesis examines the approach of Ladislav Čemický towards the socialist realism which 
was a method of artistic creation created in the USSR and forcefully applied to the countries 
within the sphere of Soviet influence around the middle of the 20th century. Ladislav Čemický 
was one of the very few Slovak artists who actively supported the onset of socialist realism in 
Slovakia, but because this field remains largely under-researched, the conclusions regarding his 
identity and attitudes towards the method consist of a few brief generalized notions lacking 
complex and critical analysis.
Today, Ladislav Čemický is mostly known for his modernist pre-totalitarian art before 1948 
and is considered the “father of the modern Slovak watercolour”. His monographists, all 
publishing before 1989, left out the era of the Stalinist socialist realism (1949-1956) without 
the needed critical evaluation; they all however admitted his support of the method. In 2019,
for the first time, in the scope of the first general overview of the Slovak Stalinist socialist realist 
fine arts, Alexandra Kusá very briefly critically evaluated his art of the era, concluding that he 
was a successful socialist realist artist. The Stalinist socialist realism thus presents a big gap in 
the life and work of Ladislav Čemický, and it can be assumed that it truly played an important 
role but because it was disregarded in 1956 and proclaimed a mistake, it was doomed to be 
forgotten and never admitted.
This thesis aims to re-claim this period of Čemický’s endeavours and answer the tow-fold 
question regarding Čemický’s approach to the foreign method: What were the attitudes of 
Ladislav Čemický towards socialist realism and how did he translate the method to both his 
theoretical and practical artistic identity during the era of Stalinism in Slovakia (1949-1956)? I 
closely analyse all Čemický’s activity in the period of the Stalinist socialist realism based on 
the critical study of the primary written and visual sources and their contextualisation in the 
Slovak art historical scope as well as in relation to the Soviet model which was set as an example 
to be followed. I study Čemický’s attitudes within his institutional involvement, his nuanced 
attitudes in the support, enforcement, and application of the method, as well as his individual 
artistic identity based on the theoretical and practical legacy. By positioning Čemický’s 
attitudes and artistic identity in relation to both his peers and the Soviet model, I not only show 
to what extent he managed to successfully understand and apply the desired Soviet example, 
but I also change the ever-present centre (USSR) and periphery (Slovakia) narrative. By 
positioning Čemický into the centre, I come to more complex findings and also uncover his 
interplay and modification of the Soviet method which presents Čemický in a different, more 
complete light than was known until this point; supporting the fidelity to oneself, to reality, and 
a degree of creative artistry even in the age of totality.
By critically re-claiming this period in Čemický’s life, it can be concluded that he was much 
more than a follower of the Party-line propaganda and rather he was an honest, patient, helpful, 
and realistic enforcer of the method, attempting to make the process of transition from 
modernism to socialist realism as successful and smooth as possible. He did not blindly copy 
the Soviet model but rather showcased a notable degree of its accommodation, proving that he 
stayed true to his interests and reality even in the era of political control. Throughout the era, 
Čemický was a socialist ideological artist, but did not give in to the empty, completely 
fabricated Party propaganda."
Designing an Interface for an Explainable Machine Learning Risk Model for Predicting Illegal Shipbreaking,"['Treur, Sander']","['Hauptmann, Hanna']",2022-07-23T00:02:41Z,EN,['HCI;Human Computer Interaction;XAI;Explainable Artificial Intelligence;Human-Centered Design;Visual Analytics;Information Visualization;Usability;Understandability;Trust;Reliance'],Human-Computer Interaction,"In the battle against 'beaching', referring to the illegally dismantling of ocean-going vessels, the IDLab as has developed machine learning models to provide predictive risk assessments of currently active ships. As the predictions that the models produce will support decision-making of the ship inspectors of the Dutch Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques were used to find explanations for the predictions. As these inspectors are experts in their domain, but novices in the field of (X)AI and data science, challenges arise with regard to making the model results accessible for them. This exemplifies a larger question on how humans interact with (X)AI and concerns aspects such as visualisation and interaction, with the aim to make predictive machine learning models accessible, understandable and trustworthy for the decision-making end-users. As existing XAI visualisation studies mainly target data scientists, the current research contributes to getting a better understanding of how to effectively design XAI visualisations for end-users. In this research, a dashboard interface design is proposed, which was created following a systematic top-down approach, including a literature review, requirements analysis with stakeholders, brainstorm and sketching session, low-fidelity prototypes, focus group sessions, the implementation of a high-fidelity prototype and a final experiment with the target users. The resulting prototype was evaluated in terms of understandability, usability and reliance, and indicated promising results. The interface was received positively by the inspectors and findings from the evaluation show no reason to assume that there are major flaws in the design. Furthermore, the proposed design for the model explanations was found to be understandable in terms of visuals, while also opening the door to new challenges regarding trust in XAI models and interpretability of their explanations."
"""Rock May Not Be Ruining the Planet, but It's Certainly Not Helping"": Sustainable Development at Dutch Music Venues.","['Duijsens, Eline']","['Ahrendt, Rebekah']",2022-07-23T00:02:53Z,EN,['Sustainability; Live Music; Concerts; Music Venues; Venues; Policy; Policy Analysis; Environmental Policy; Single Use Plastic'],Musicology,"In recent years, musicians and music industry professionals have become aware of the environmental impact of the live music sector. Since the decline of record sales due to streaming, tours have taken over as the primary income source for musicians. Therefore, the global live music sector continues to grow in revenue—27 billion USD in 2019—, but also emissions. The enjoyment of live music continues to have a negative impact on the environment in terms of emissions and physical waste.
In this thesis, I address the environmental impact of live music with special attention to the role of venues. My focus is on the Netherlands because of its significant live music scene, but also due to the unique legal hierarchy of the nation that places international treaties above domestic law. The now-famous climate case of Stichting Urgenda has shown that the Dutch government has been neglecting its duty to reduce emissions economy-wide as set out in the 2016 (ratified) Paris Agreement. The thesis considers the steps taken—or not—by Dutch law and policy aimed at reducing the environmental impact of music venues, as received and enacted by the venues themselves. Through semi-structured interviews with employees of five Dutch popular music venues I establish the obstacles and motivations for the venues to take environmental action. I then analyze Dutch local and national policy regarding sustainability following Thomas Birkland’s methods for policy process analysis, demonstrating the gaps between policy and practice.
In Chapter One, I define sustainability. In Chapter Two, I establish the environmental impact of concerts. In Chapter Three and Four, I elaborate on the Dutch policy context and plastic policies. In the three final chapters, I present the findings of the interviews and highlight relevant policies.
The findings of this thesis support the conclusion that sustainability policies for arts and culture, and in particular the live music sector, need improvement. Financial support for the sustainable development of the live music sector lacks and resources related to subsidies and sustainable development in general are not sufficient. Additionally, the venues studied here demonstrated that single-use plastic regulations are unnecessarily loose and may in fact be counterproductive. Ultimately, the government needs to step up their economy-wide sustainable policy and collaborate with the music sector to effectively and quickly make enjoyment less harmful to the environment."
The Limits of Postcolonial Democratisation: Decolonisation and the Persistence of Colonial Institutions in Nigeria,"['Korfage, Daan']","['Rosen Jacobson, Liesbeth']",2022-07-23T00:02:50Z,EN,['colonialism; decolonisation; postcolonialism; democracy; authoritarianism; democratisation; Nigeria; Africa; Biafran War; historical institutionalism; political history'],Geschiedenis van Politiek en Maatschappij,"In the early 1960s, Nigeria was seen as an example of successful decolonisation, and when civil war broke out in 1967, the conflict was simplified and misunderstood as interethnic or religious violence. In reality, the failure of electoral democracy was the result of a complex history in which colonial legacy played a formative role. Using Wunyabari Maloba’s concept of incomplete decolonisation, and source material consisting of colonial policy documents, correspondences and newspaper articles, this thesis explains how the persistence of colonial institutions inhibited the development of true and sustainable democracy in postcolonial Nigeria from 1960 to 1975.

Tracing political institutions, imposed by the British during the 1950s, this thesis analyses to what extent these institutions persisted during the first fifteen years of independence in Nigeria, and assesses how compatible they are with democratic values. The British paternalistic methods of “building democracy” seemed successful on the outside, but behind the façade of electoral democracy, colonial attitudes and institutions transferred to the First Republic. Some important traits of British colonialism that persisted in Nigeria include the flawed system of federalism, the intolerant stance against political opponents, and the disregard for public opinion. The political system had authoritarianism, tribalism and exclusion built in due to its colonial roots, which led to internal colonialism, and inhibited national unity and democratic party politics. The colonial institutions slowly tore the country apart, resulting in the devastating Biafran War and a vicious cycle of authoritarianism."

Sinds de jaren tachtig is het semantisch veld rondom het concept hierdoor veranderd. Politieke denkers die zich over het algemeen laten verdelen over links en rechts hebben een andere opvatting over welke concepten in relatie staan tot het neoliberalisme. Daarom zijn er in de periode van 1982 t/m 2014 twee verschillende semantische velden omtrent de term tot stand gekomen. Bij de VVD gaat men uit van een semantisch veld dat doet denken aan het ordoliberalisme; de meer gematigde Duitse variant van het neoliberalisme. Dit semantisch veld bestaat uit onder andere de concepten volkomen concurrentie, prijsmechanisme, open markten en rechtstaat. Aan de linkerkant van de politiek wordt sinds de jaren negentig het semantisch veld ingevuld door concepten als kapitalisme, privatisering en eigenbelang. Sinds de jaren negentig wordt de term door politieke denkers aan de linkerzijde namelijk veelal gebruikt als socialistische strijdleus tegen politiek-economisch beleid dat als onwenselijk wordt beschouwd. Hierdoor is onder andere het onderscheid tussen de begrippen kapitalisme en neoliberalisme minder helder geworden. Doordat de linkerzijde een pejoratieve betekenis ging toekennen aan de term kwam de VVD als verondersteld neoliberale partij in het beklaagdenbankje terecht. Daarom zien we bij deze partij een ambivalente houding ten opzichte van de term in deze 32 jaar. Zo zien politieke denkers van de partij zich in de jaren tachtig niet als neoliberaal, in de jaren negentig wel en rond de Kredietcrisis bestaat het neoliberalisme ineens helemaal niet of bestond het alleen in het verleden. Politieke motivaties hebben de betekenis van de term daarom ernstig doen verwateren."

De formele instituties zijn vooral gericht op de arbeidsparticipatie van vrouwen en zijn relatief succesvol gebleken op dit vlak.

A variety of social, economic and political tensions and racial antagonisms conspired to create a surge in the prevalence of racial violence, in particular white-on-black violence. Through looking at the depiction of the events of the Red Summer of 1919 and the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 in contemporary printed news media, this thesis examines the portrayal of both black and white racial identities in regard to the violence that was committed in order to assess what common narratives surrounding racial violence were prevalent during this time period. These narratives typically depict one group as the aggressor or instigator of violence and the other as the victim of violence, and in turn influence the conceptions and ideation of contemporary readers. This thesis ultimately posits that, in contrast to the spectacle-like elements of the depictions of lynchings which sought to emphasise white violence as a tool of oppression, the news depictions of instances of mass racial violence generally emphasized and connected the committing of violence to African Americans, while white Americans were depicted as victims. The disparate attention and coverage that resulted in the formation of this narrative fed into a broader trend of white supremacist thought, which presented and considered the actions and autonomy of African Americans as a threat to the existing racial hierarchy and white superiority enforced by white supremacy."

Nearly fifty years of Soviet occupation have shaped the cultural and collective memory of Lithuania and with it, its attitude towards Russian music. Therefore this paper suggests that while an “embargo” on Russian music culture is considered a symbolic act of support towards Ukraine, the issue should be viewed in a wider framework that considers geopolitical and historical contexts from the perspective of memory studies. Based on a critical discourse analysis of Lithuanian media coverage on Russian music, this paper suggests that the embargo on Russian music in Lithuania entails distancing itself from the oppressor and from the cultural space that Lithuania and Russia once shared."
Scheduling Electric Buses with Stochastic Driving Times,"['Bruin, Philip de']","['Akker, Marjan van den']",2022-07-28T01:00:42Z,EN,['Vehicle Scheduling Problem; Simulated Annealing; Hybrid Algorithm; Simulation'],Computing Science,"In this thesis we look at the Stochastic Electric Vehicle Scheduling Problem. In this problem we are given a set of trips, and we need to schedule vehicles such that each trip is driven. We apply this problem to electric buses, where we want to minimize the operating cost taking the battery life into account. Here, we want to make our schedules more robust against delays. These delays could be caused by, for example, various traffic conditions, or passenger loads, as these factors have an effect on the driving time. Thus, in order to make our schedules more robust against these delays, we use stochastic driving times instead of deterministic driving times. Not only the driving time itself could be a source of delays, but also the energy consumption. Bus drivers have different driving styles, which affects the energy consumption, and thus the time needed for charging. Thus, we also consider the energy consumption to be stochastic.

To achieve this, we use a combination of simulated annealing and simulation. Here, we use simulation to calculate the cost of a solution. This, however, comes with a performance penalty. Thus, we try different methods of determining how many simulations we need, such that we still make a correct choice about which solution is better. The techniques we consider here are: Optimal Computation Budget Allocation, Indifference Zones, and a method we developed ourselves, which uses t-tests.

We show that the use of some of these methods can increase the runtime performance while performing similar in terms of their final score. Furthermore, with our use of stochastic driving times, we see in increase in the punctuality of the buses, and they also arrive a bit earlier at the start of their trip. However, we also see a slight increase in operating cost, as we need slightly more buses compared to when we use deterministic driving times."

Readers can be shown that sexualities and identities perceived as ‘abnormal’ are as valid as those labelled normative. Such counter-stories are especially important for young adults who struggle with their sexual and gender identity. They need to have literature they can relate to since this enables them to think more critically about their emotions and remind them they are not alone in their feelings. Through initiatives such as de Diversity & Inclusivity Code, Dutch cultural institutes attempt to ensure they represent the broad diversity of Dutch society. However, while the availability of queer young adult literature (YAL) has seen an increase in the global literary market, this thesis discovered there is still much to gain in the diversification of the Dutch literary field aimed at queer teenagers. The data indicated that the overall queer representation in Dutch YAL published in 2021 corresponds to the average of queer teenagers in the Netherlands. However, a closer look at these statistics showed that many sexualities and identities remain underrepresented or not represented at all. Additionally, the close readings revealed that heteronormativity is challenged in queer YAL, but cisnormativity remains present and largely untouched."

When the advice of the Education Council is followed, inequality of opportunity up to the third grade will be combated. But with the old system is reinstated after the third grade, inequality of opportunity will arise again. It is therefore important to introduce a system after the third grade in which children receive appropriate education. To establish this, I argue that it is necessary to provide personal education, whereby children can follow subjects at the level that suits them. The capability of choice, the factor of participation, and the inequality of opportunity which can be understood as structural injustice, must therefore be properly explained. These three factors are closely related. Allowing this to play a big role in policy-making regarding education, will contribute to combating inequality of opportunity and better education for every child. Shadow education also shows the added value of personal education on results. Through this line of inquiry, I found that personal education is important because it contributes to the proper development of each child's capabilities. This allows me to conclude that personal education, in the shape of taking courses at the level that fits the child, should also take place after the third grade."

Meta-Critique: Critiquing Visions on the Female Body on Instagram,"['Tukker, Sanne']","['Lange, Michiel de']",2022-07-28T01:02:28Z,EN,['Instagram; critique; postfeminism; neoliberalism; body positivity; affordances'],"Media, Art and Performance studies","My summary is threefold. Firstly, I found that Instagram’s affordances facilitated multiple outcomes but that because the platform itself is embedded in a culture informed by neoliberalism and postfeminism, one of the outcomes was that women can feel like they are at competition with each other. On the other hand however, I found that women can also feel like they have been provided the tools to critique the platform they find themselves on. Although the described affordances of visibility, persistence, editability and association appear more likely to uphold dominant standards on the platform, critical accounts use those same affordances in an attempt to break down those same dominant standards. 
	Secondly, I explored which dominant discourses about female body norms are explored on critical Instagram accounts. What I found, is that on Instagram, levels of self-surveillance are heightened because of the high standards that women feel like they have to abide by. This in turn, may foster feelings of competition among women, as they feel like they must be better than other women on the platform or must at least try to be perfect. As competition is thus easily fostered on the platform, solidarity is broken down. In an attempt to go against the grain on the platform however, not only do the critical accounts critically go against dominant discourses on Instagram, but they also attempt to form online collectives of solidarity. 
	Thirdly, I explored how norm-defying accounts provide critique through their visibility on Instagram. What has become clear through that exploration is that visibility can be incredibly empowering to those who usually do not see themselves represented in everyday media. Critiquing the standard however, has been shown to be difficult for the one providing critique, by several academics because people have a natural sense of wanting to belong. Going against the grain online, a space where both patriarchal restrictions as well as women’s resilience are persistent, can be challenging even when it appears that online, women have been provided the means to do so. Nonetheless, users that I analysed exemplify that providing critique on the culture on the platform that they find themselves on is possible. They share similar sentiments with regards to body normativity on Instagram and manage to create a form of online solidarity through their use of hashtags, commenting on each other’s content and using language which indicates they are speaking to a larger crowd. Although the examples discussed throughout my thesis do so in different ways, they manage to go against the deconstruction of solidarity that is often found on Instagram with its focus on competition and its neoliberal and postfeminist informed discourses.
	All in all, I have located a form of critique on Instagram that I named meta-critique. This type of critique has been described to arise through the workings of three factors on Instagram namely the levels of different affordances on Instagram as described in chapter four, notions of online solidarity and the difficulty to escape Instagram’s neoliberal informed postfeminism. The content that I have analysed shows that women can use Instagram’s affordances in order to show that which is usually hidden, such as “imperfect” skin or “imperfect” bodies. This is not done by dismissing popular Instagram practices such as posting selfies of photos of oneself wearing a bikini, but rather by taking these popular Instagram practices and trying to change the narrative around them. It has also become clear that although critical Instagram users have found themselves in an online environment which is strongly informed by neoliberal and postfeminist narratives, they manage to go against these narratives. These practices showed by the critical accounts that I analysed have shown what I consider to be meta-critique."
"Greening Novib: Historicizing the Environmentalization of Novib's Developmental Aid, 1986-1992","['Wit, Annabel de Wit de']","['Gerits, Frank']",2022-07-28T01:02:32Z,EN,['Developmental Aid; Environmentalization; Historicization; NGOs; Novib'],International Relations in Historical Perspective,"In the second half of the 20th century, the global environmental discourse experienced a major change. From a focus on conservation and preservation until the late 1960s, sustainable development became the norm in the 1970s and 1980s. Hereby, the concept of environment changed as well during this period, environment degenerated from a limited concept, which was mainly related to agriculture and nature itself, to a concept that was completely intertwined with human survival. This study will demonstrate that this change in discourse is reflected in the norms and practices of Novib, a Dutch developmental NGO, within the form of ‘environmentalization’. By examining primary sources from the Oxfam Novib Archives situated in the National Archives in the Hague this study will attempt to illustrate this process of environmentalization within Novib’s policy through the years 1986 to 1992. The focus of the analysis is on Novib's discourse, norms, and practices of both North-South relations and the related link between environment and development. In doing so, this study not only extends the existing work on environmentalization by applying it to foreign aid but brings in a historicizing factor as well by applying the contemporary theory of environmentalization to a historical case."
Mapping Neuronal Activity in the Brain Using Hemodynamic Activity to Quantify a Disconnect Between Normal and Abnormal Coupling,"['Irgolitsch, Frans']","['Mulder, Martijn']",2022-07-28T01:02:24Z,EN,['deep learning; machine learning; neuro-vascular coupling;'],Artificial Intelligence,"In this project we tried to develop a machine learning method for learning the neu- ronal activation patterns based on hemodynamic activity in the mouse brain, both represented as functional connectivity optical intrinsic signal (fcOIS) imaging. The goal of this method is to quantify the hemodynamic coupling in the brain and use it to look for a disconnect in brains that are subject to pathology or aged.
For this, two deep learning architectures were developed which are both suited to recreating data based on an encoded input. These architectures are the varia- tional autoencoder (VAE) and the variational autoencoding generative adversarial networks (VAE-GAN). These architectures use the hemodynamic data to create a re- construction of the neuronal activity. As the fcOIS data consist of data which have both spatial and temporal elements, a combination of convolutional and recurrent layers is used in the architectures to try and learn the features in the data.
Unfortunately, the architectures did not produce satisfactory results. The samples generated by the VAE suffered from mode collapse and the VAE-GAN produced blurry results. The samples generated by the networks are not suited for further investigation into the quantification of the coupling. We do show, however, that the VAE performs slightly better in this task with the current parameters. Improvements might be made by obtaining more data from the mice and by pre-training parts of the architectures used."
"Demistocracy: a means to rebalance political powers in contemporary France?
An ethical inquiry into democratic innovation","['Valluy, Claire']","['Nyholm, Sven']",2022-07-28T01:02:30Z,EN,['democracy; democratic innovation; deliberative democracy; epistocracy; ethics; power (im)balances; France; Yellow Vests; Grand Débat National; Citizens’ Initiative Referendums.'],Applied Ethics,"This paper starts by taking a Foucauldian genealogical approach to uncover the power imbalances which underpin the French political arrangement in 2022. It advances that such imbalances are two-fold. First, it notes the separation, or lack thereof, of the legislative and executive powers. Second, and crucially, it recognises a power asymmetry between the governing powers and the citizenry of France. It explores how to resolve such power asymmetries and ensure ethical governance, by investigating innovative democratic practices. In doing so, I subscribe to a rule-based instrumentalist approach. In order to anchor this research in a concrete context, I focus on the claims of the Gilets Jaunes – Yellow Vest protesters – to Citizens’ Initiative Referendums (RICs), and on the government’s response, i.e., its attempt at furthering participative and (pseudo)deliberative practices – The Grand Débat National (GDN). I suggest why RICs are not necessarily the way forward. Additionally, following an empirical ethics methodology, I provide an explanation as to why the GDN failed to rebalance powers. I finally broaden our épistèmes, and analytically argue against Estlund’s postulate for democratic authority by invoking Brennan’s epistocratic argument. Estlund’s argument is particularly relevant for my argumentative purposes as it intends to provide support for a democratic political arrangement that is epistemic in nature. I proceed to sketch research avenues for democratic innovation in France by suggesting that we should favour a hybrid system: demistocracy. I conclude and briefly address potential concerns with this proposal."

This thesis investigates whether BERT, a contextual language model, can be used to identify dual-use goods based on a short description of the good and whether it can be improved by augmenting it with relational dual-use knowledge. Two methods from augmenting BERT are explored: by further pre-training BERT on relevant synthetic sentences from the KELM corpus and by augmenting it with knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) created from Wikidata. The use of KGEs can improve the performance of a logistic regression model on the dual-use identification task. All implementations of BERT perform well on the dual-use identification task and have a better performance compared to the logistic regression models. None of the BERT implementations augmented with relational dual-use knowledge outperformed the plain implementation of BERT."

Het uitgangspunt voor deze analyse is het idee dat culturele producten over het algemeen een grotere invloed hebben op het (her)vormen van de publieke herinnering dan historisch onderzoek. Hoewel er de laatste jaren veel historisch onderzoek is verricht naar de Indonesische Onafhankelijkheidsoorlog, worden de resultaten hiervan vaak maar door een kleine, geïnteresseerde groep gelezen. Het grote publiek komt echter vooral met het onderwerp in aanraking doormiddel van fictionele representaties van de geschiedenis in bijvoorbeeld een film of roman. De analyse in deze scriptie richt zich dan ook op het narratief over de Indonesische Onafhankelijkheidsoorlog dat via fictionele werken als De tolk van Java en De Oost wordt overgedragen. In de analyse van beide werken wordt gebruik gemaakt van inzichten uit zowel cultural memory studies als postkoloniale studies om inzicht te krijgen in de manier waarop deze roman en film de Indonesische Onafhankelijkheidsoorlog representeren en op welke manier ze zich verhouden tot de postkoloniale discussie over de omgang met deze oorlog in Nederland. Met gebruik van een uit de narratologie afkomstig instrumentarium wordt in kaart gebracht wat de lezer/kijker op basis van deze twee werken te weten komt over de Indonesische Onafhankelijkheidsoorlog, wiens verhaal er wordt gerepresenteerd en ook hoe de geschiedenis van dit in Nederland toch moeilijk ‘herinnerbare’ verleden wordt overgebracht. In deze scriptie wordt getoond hoe De tolk van Java en De Oost als ‘herinneringsmakers’ fungeren en op welke manier ze, in meer en mindere mate, een ‘tegenherinnering’ vormen die een tegengeluid biedt tegen het dominante Nederlandse discours rondom de Indonesische Onafhankelijkheidsoorlog. Hoewel De tolk van Java en De Oost zeer verschillend zijn, presenteren zij het publiek allebei een vertelling die korte metten maakt met lang gekoesterde narratief dat Nederlandse militairen in Indonesië zich over het algemeen ‘correct’ hebben gedragen. Tegelijkertijd kunnen zowel De tolk van Java als De Oost vanuit een postkoloniaal interpretatiekader, nog kritisch beschouwd worden."
"WEST NILE VIRUS IN EUROPE: Epidemiology, drivers of transmission and an integrated approach to surveillance and control.","['Olufotebi, Ifeoluwa']","['Brand, Judith van den']",2022-08-02T00:00:53Z,EN,['West Nile Virus; Europe; spread; transmission; surveillance; control; prevention'],One Health,"West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito borne virus that is maintained in nature in a bird-mosquito-bird transmission cycle. Mosquitos can occasionally infect humans and other vertebrate animals like horses and crocodiles.  Most West Nile virus infections are characterized by subclinical signs like fever, headache, and weakness; however, infections can also progress to more severe neurological manifestations and death.

It was initially discovered in the West Nile province of Uganda and the virus is widely distributed in Africa, Europe, Australia, and Asia. In recent years, sporadic cases and major outbreaks have increased in Europe, especially in countries around the Mediterranean Sea, the South-Eastern region, and Central Europe. In addition, recent pattern also shows the geographical spread of the virus towards the Northern part of Europe.  The increased geographical spread and occurrence of WNV infections in Europe makes it a public health concern. Therefore, this literature review provides an overview of West Nile Virus infection in general, evaluating the spread across Europe and factors that influenced the distribution.

The spread of the virus can be influenced by the migratory behavior of birds. Migratory birds can cause re-introduction of the virus in an area and the host competence among resident birds can also have an impact on the continued circulation of the virus. The Culex species of mosquito is the most ubiquitous species in Europe, and it plays a significant role in the transmission of WNV. It has two different biotypes which differ in their physiological and behavioral capacity affecting transmission dynamics in different regions. Also, climate change is an important environmental driver for WNV transmission. Higher temperatures play an important role in the growth rate of mosquito population, viral replication rate and contact rate between host and mosquitos. Precipitation creates favorable conditions for interaction between mosquito and hosts and affects the larval stage of the mosquitos.

The interaction between environmental drivers, reservoir host and mosquito vector are complex. Hence, an integrated approach to surveillance, prevention and control can help mitigate the impact of the virus within Europe and this is further discussed in the review. Vector surveillance of mosquitos can help early identification of WNV circulation. Dead bird and active bird surveillance can provide information about the potential risk of introduction of WNV within an area. Also, active, and passive surveillance of horses can help monitor the virus circulation and ensure prompt identification of outbreaks within the equine and human population. Human syndromic surveillance and routine screening of blood transfusion and organ transplantation is also an effective strategy for WNV surveillance. Regarding control, vector management of both larva and adult mosquito population are efficient control measures. Vaccinations are only currently available for horses, hence more preventive methods against WNV are advised.

To conclude, for the different surveillance, prevention, and control strategies to work. It needs to be an integrated approach that is tailored to each country epidemiological situation to optimize efficiency and rational use of resources. This would involve a multisectoral collaboration between veterinarians, epidemiologist, public health workers, public institutions, and other allied professionals to ensure early detection of the virus, appropriate control, and an efficient response during an outbreak."

In vivo molecular imaging could be used to accelerate the development of new nanovaccines. To obtain these images the nanovaccine must be radiolabeled. This study aimed to optimize the radiolabeling of a new Human Serum Albumin (HSA) NP bound to bevacizumab (NPA-B) and studied the biodistribution of NPA-B in mice after subcutaneous injection. The different parameters studied for optimization of radiolabeling were: influence of decreasing the end volume on size stability, influence of adding saline to NPA-B on size, stability of NPA-B at pH 4 and stability of NPA-B during 180 min. NPA-B were double radiolabeled (bevacizumab with [67Ga] GaCl3; HSA NP with [99mTc] TcO4Na) and subcutaneously administered to mice. SPECT/CT images showed activity in axillary and inguinal lymph nodes which indicates that immune cells transport NPA-B to the lymph node to initiate an immune response. In future studies bevacizumab will be replaced for S and N severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) proteins to study the biodistribution of a novel COVID-19 vaccine."

The first chapter explores theories behind authorship, controversial authorship as well as fanfiction and paratexts. In the second chapter these theories are used to contextualize and analyze how fanfiction writers struggle with Rowling's presence in the Harry Potter universe. Consequently, fanfiction writers use paratexts to articulate their disapproval of Rowling's Tweets and use them and their works of fanfiction to appropriate the Harry Potter universe and thereby reject Rowling."

"Adult Attachment, Mental Health and the Potential Mitigating Role of Psychological Flexibility","['Mathijsen, Marit']","['Geenen, Rinie']",2022-08-02T00:01:08Z,EN,"['attachment, psychological flexibility, mental health, ACT.']",Clinical Psychology,"The association between attachment and mental health has been extensively researched in recent decades (Bowlby, 1969; Kafetsios & Sideridis, 2006; Karreman & Vingerhoets 2012; Magai et al., 2016). An attempt has often been made to understand which aspects of attachment may be particularly important for wellbeing. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is centralized around the concept of psychological flexibility and its importance in overcoming problems. This thesis examines the possible association of the interaction between psychological flexibility and attachment with mental health by performing a moderator analysis. It was hypothesized that psychological flexibility moderated the association between the insecure attachment style and reduced mental health, such that there would be a lower association between the insecure attachment style and reduced mental health with higher psychological flexibility than at lower levels. The mindful dimension of psychological flexibility in particular was expected to be a potential moderator, which was tested in a second moderator analysis. The regression analyses confirmed a significant association of psychological flexibility with mental health. However, there was no association found of attachment and mental health. Also, no interaction effect was found of psychological flexibility and attachment with mental health. The outcomes are limited by the cross-sectional design of the current study. A clinical experiment is suggested to determine whether psychological flexibility can overrule the potential negative effects of insecure attachment."

Connecting at a Distance: Fostering Empathy in Remote Healthcare Applications,"['Defauwes, Bas']","['Lykourentzou, I.']",2022-08-04T00:00:53Z,EN,['Empathy;Telehealth;'],Human-Computer Interaction,"In recent years, remote healthcare has become more and more relevant. It provides
unique advantages and can increase accessibility to healthcare for many. Although
remote healthcare has unique advantages, it also has some unique drawbacks. One
of these is the negative experiences of patients and health-care providers (HCP)
using remote healthcare. A systematic literature review revealed that both patients
and HCP dislike remote healthcare, and feel it is often ’cold’ or impersonal, but
research that measures empathy between patients and HCP surprisingly does not
find a significant difference between empathy in remote healthcare and face-to-face
settings. In light of this, this research aims to answers the question: ""How can
technology foster the necessary degree of empathy between patients and healthcare
providers, to improve the quality of telehealth applications?""

To answer this question, semi-structured interviews were conducted with general
practitioners (GPs) and their utterances were analysed using a design thinking approach,
using customer journeys and bottom-up pattern analysis of their utterances.
The goal was to output a set of design recommendations grounded in the literature,
which have been validated through a qualitative approach.

The interviews revealed that empathy was not actually lacking between patient and
HCP. HCP did often have strong negative opinions of remote healthcare. It was
hypothesized that these negative opinions led them to believe that the empathy
they can convey using remote healthcare was lacking, even when in reality patients
were satisfied. This would also explain the revelation from the literature review that
indicated that there was no significant difference in empathy between face-to-face
and remote settings. The created customer journeys, supported by the discovered
patterns, revealed three types of opportunities for changing the negative opinions of
GPs: Opportunities to persuade GPs to try more remote healthcare, opportunities for
GPs to share knowledge about remote healthcare, and opportunities to reduce the
stress GPs experience.

Implementing the created design recommendations based on the discovered opportunities
might change the negative opinions GPs have of remote healthcare. In turn,
the empathy they experience and expect during their use of remote healthcare might
improve."

as an alternative approach that is based on the microscopic details of the particles, which are encoded in the excluded volume. With the use of symmetry arguments, a basis of the excluded volume of two banana-shaped particles in terms of symmetry-adapted functions is constructed. This microscopic approach opens up many opportunities for describing the complicated phases and phase transitions of liquid crystals of anisotropically-shaped particles."
The Relationship Between Mindfulness and Social Anxiety Disorder: The Mediation Effect of Self-Concept Clarity,"['Battjes, Marie Claire']","['Tuijl, Lonneke van']",2022-08-03T00:01:43Z,EN,"['social anxiety disorder, mindfulness, self-concept clarity, mediation analysis']",Clinical Psychology,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders. Prevention may be particularly important for SAD as only a low number of individuals seek treatment and high personal costs are associated with the disorder. Recent research has suggested that mindfulness might be a resilience factor for the development of SAD, as well as that mindfulness-based interventions are effective in the treatment of SAD. Current research examines the relationship between mindfulness and SAD and proposes SCC as a mediational factor. A number of 432 undergraduate students completed self-report measures aimed at measuring trait mindfulness, SCC, SAD and self-esteem. Results from the mediation analysis indicated that SCC was indeed partially mediating the effect of mindfulness on SA symptoms, even after controlling for gender and self-esteem. The found mediational role of SCC is novel and if assumed causal directions can be confirmed in future research, current results can potentially provide opportunities for improving current prevention programs for SAD."
Speech-based Depression Prediction with Symptoms as Interpretable Intermediate Features,"['Steijn, Floris van']","['Kaya, Heysem']",2022-08-04T00:00:43Z,EN,"['depression, interpretable machine learning, explainable AI']",Artificial Intelligence,"Mood disorders in general and depression in particular are common and their impact on individuals and society is high. Roughly 5% of adults worldwide suffer from depression. Commonly, depression diagnosis involves using questionnaires, either clinician-rated or self-reported. Due to the subjectivity in questionnaire methods and high human-related costs involved, there are ongoing efforts to find more objective and easily attainable depression markers. As is the case with recent audio, visual and linguistic applications, state-of-the-art approaches for automated depression severity prediction heavily depend on deep learning and black box modeling without explainability and interpretability considerations. However, for reasons ranging from regulations to understanding the extent and limitations of the model, the clinicians need to understand the decision making process of the model to confidently form their decisions. In this work, I focus on speech-based depression severity level prediction on DAIC-WOZ corpus and benefit from PHQ-8 questionnaire items to predict the symptoms as interpretable high level features. I show that using a multi-task regression approach with state-of-the-art text-based features to predict the depression symptoms, it is possible to reach a viable test set Concordance Correlation Coefficient performance comparable to the state-of-the-art systems, while improving on the interpretability of the overall prediction system."
The Relation of PSMU and ADHD Symptoms and the Interaction with Gender,"['Kuipers, Fleur']","['Ouvrein, Gaëlle']",2022-08-04T12:00:31Z,EN,"['Problematic social media use, ADHD symptoms, multiple regression, Dutch youth']",Youth Studies,"Previous studies on the relation of problematic social media use on ADHD symptoms (attention deficit, impulsivity, and hyperactivity) lacked focus on the relation of gender. This relationship and whether it interacted with gender was cross-sectionally investigated in the current study among adolescents aged 11 to 16 in the Netherlands. Data from the 2017 wave from the Digital Youth Project (DYP) was analyzed. This sample included N = 696 respondents after data cleaning aged between 11 and 16 (M = 12.94, SD = .03). In line with previous studies the results of the multiple regression analysis showed that problematic social media was related to the ADHD symptoms. However, the interaction with gender was not substantiated. The current study adds to research regarding the relation and substantiates that future policies be shaped similarly for boys and girls. In short, problematic use of social media is related to ADHD symptoms, and gender does not interact with this relation according to the results of the current study."

"Examining psychological problems in adolescents: the associations with flourishing, resilience and social support","['Pel, Irene']","['Kleinjan, M.']",2022-08-04T12:00:42Z,EN,[],Youth Studies,"Background: Compared to ten years ago, the percentage of young people between 12 and 25 years old reporting psychological problems has increased significantly from 7% to 8% (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, 2018). Psychological problems can result in numerous short- and long-term problems. Therefore, it is of importance to examine potential protective factors.
Aim: Protective factors associated with psychological problems are amongst other things  flourishing, resilience and social support. The present study aims to further examine the associations between these potential prospective factors and psychological problems. In addition, the moderating effect of gender within these associations is assessed.
Methods: Data from the national representative Dutch Sentinel Study is used (N = 5,398), including adolescents aged 12-16 (M = 14.45, SD =1.34).
Results: Results of the multivariate regression model indicate that flourishing and resilience are both associated with a decrease in psychological problems. Contrary to what was expected, social support was not significantly associated with psychological problems. When taking gender into account, the association between flourising and psychological problems appeared stronger for girls compared to boys.
Conclusion: Flourishing and resilience function as protective factors for psychological problems. Further research is needed to confirm and further clarify the stronger association between flourishing and psychological problems, especially for girls."
Loneliness and (excessive) alcohol use among adolescents in the Netherlands and the effect of the parent-child relationship,"['Oude, Coco de']","['Heu, L.C.']",2022-08-04T12:00:36Z,EN,['alcohol use; loneliness; parent-child relationship;  adolescents'],Youth Studies,"A small group of adolescents drink heavily, which may lead to negative health outcomes such as brain damage. Although alcohol is often consumed with others, research also shows that adolescents sometimes cope with feelings of isolation, by drinking more alcohol. In addition, the parent-child relationship might influence the relation between loneliness and alcohol use, serving as a protective factor. The current study investigates the longitudinal relation between loneliness and alcohol use among adolescents and the effect of having a positive parent-child relationship. Data from the first three waves of the ‘YOUth Got Talent’-project (Inchley et al., 2017; Stevens et al., 2018) is used. The sample contained 390 students (Mage= 17.33, SDage= 1.34), from different MBO-schools in Utrecht. Results of the regression analysis showed an effect in the opposite direction than hypothesized: lonelier adolescents predict decreased alcohol use of adolescents. Accordingly, it was not found that lonely adolescents with a good parent-child relationship consume less alcohol. Other non-family related relationships may play a more important role in predicting alcohol consumption. The results suggest that further research should consider the social environment."
The association between introversion and the motives of using music among adolescents in the Netherlands,"['Heurter, Bibi']","['Heu, L.C.']",2022-08-04T12:00:38Z,EN,"['Introversion, Emotional Music Use, Background Music use, Gender, Age, Moderation']",Youth Studies,"Research has shown that listening to music can especially help adolescents to deal with problems and improve their mood. However, among adolescents there are differences in motives for listening to music in daily life due to personality. For instance, extraverts and introverts differ from each other and in the way they use music.  This study looked at whether the personality trait introversion influences the motives for using music. In addition, it is investigated whether gender influences music use and whether it moderates the association between introversion and music use. Music use is subdivided into ‘emotional music use’ ( emotional regulation) and ‘background music use’(music as background stimulus) .The sample contained of 1079 female (70.7%) and male (29,3%) adolescents. The age range varied from 13 to 30 years (M= 20,3, SD= 3.61). A Linear Regression analysis was performed. As predicted results indicated that people that score high on introversion are more likely to use music as emotioanl regulation.
Also, results indicated that people who scored low on introversion are more likely to use  music as background stimulus. Furthermore, an effect of gender was found on music use but the results did not indicate that there was an moderating effect of gender on the relationship between introversion and music use. This study shows the importance of individual differences in music use, based on the personality trait introversion."
"Relationship Status, Feeling Sad, Openness to New Experiences and Gender Differences in Preference for Listening to Sad Music among Late Adolescents and Emerging Adults","['Kranendonk, Sara']","['Bogt, Tom ter']",2022-08-04T12:00:46Z,EN,"['romantic relationship, sad music preference, openness to new experiences, feeling  sad, gender']",Youth Studies,"Listening to sad music may evoke sadness in certain people, which is typically assumed to be undesirable. The aim of this study was to investigate if: (a) being single contributes to listening to sad music, (b) gender and openness to new experiences moderate, and (c) feeling sad mediates the relationship between being single and listening to sad music. The study had a cross-sectional design, with N = 238. The participants were late adolescents and emerging adults (18-29 years old). The analyses only showed a significant result for the main effect of openness on listening to sad music. Therefore, according to the results in this study, being single is not related to late adolescents and emerging adults listening to sad music more often. There is also no difference between males and females in their incline to listen to sad music. No interaction effects were found for gender and openness. Feeling sad is also not found to be a mediator. A bigger sample, with a focus on adolescents,could reveal different outcomes in future research. Because, some marginal significant positive effects were found with regard to the potential moderating effects of gender and the mediating effect of feeling sad."

This study aimed to explore whether parental control moderates the relation between internet gaming disorder (IGD) and school attainment, and whether these relationships are further moderated by gender. Methods:As part of the Digital Youth Project of the University of Utrecht, a one wave sample of 11- to 18-year-old adolescents (N = 1327) was used. The students answered questions to measure the problematic use of gaming, levels of parental control and school attainment. Results: The excessive use of games and high levels of parental control were negatively related to school attainment; however, this study did not find a significant interaction between parental control and internet gaming disorder in relation to school attainment. In addition, the interaction was also non significant regarding gender. Conclusion: This study provides further evidence that excessive gaming affects school attainment negatively, and that parental control does not buffer IGD in its relation to school attainment, for both boys and girls."

Therefore, it is important to identify risk factors from various domains that contribute to adolescents’ BD. The current study investigated which factors in the individual (enhancement and coping motives), peer (descriptive and injunctive norms), and parent (alcohol-specific rules and parental monitoring) domain contributed to the BD prevalence among adolescents in a Dutch municipality, as well as the moderating role of gender and frequency of alcohol use. Dutch adolescents (N = 1006) aged 11 to 17 completed an online self-report questionnaire on drinking motives, social norms, (alcohol-specific) parenting practices, alcohol use, and BD. Logistic regression analyses per domain showed that stronger enhancement motives, and positive descriptive and injunctive norms increased the likelihood to engage in BD, while strict alcohol-specific rules decreased the likelihood to engage in BD. Together, only stronger enhancement motives (individual) and more positive injunctive norms (peers) remained significant. These findings have implications for the development of multi-level interventions that are pressed to be needed for complex problems as adolescents’ BD."

Building on social learning theory and cultivation theory, this study examined adolescents' music preferences in relation to sexual gender stereotypes and sexual objectification. Complementing previous studies, it examined not only sexual objectification of the female body but also of the male body, and whether this relationship differs between boys and girls, and between religious and non-religious adolescents. Correlation and regression analyses of data from a 2010 sample of 480 Dutch high school students, aged 13 to 16, showed that music preferences were associated with sexual gender stereotyping and sexual objectification. Urban music was consistently related to higher levels of sexual gender stereotyping and sexual objectification. There were no significant differences between boys and girls. Among non-religious adolescents compared to religious adolescents, a preference for electronic music was associated with higher sexual gender stereotyping and sexual objectification of boys. Further research should focus on exploring ways in which urban music can be used to keep adolescents from sexual gender stereotyping and sexual objectification, and instead educate them about gender roles and sex in a positive, healthy way."
Giving in to desires: Examining the relation between trait hedonic capacity and happiness and the mediating role of regulatory focus.,"['Dano, Jonas']","['Versteegt, Lisanne']",2022-08-09T00:02:59Z,EN,['trait hedonic capacity; happiness; promotion focus; prevention focus; selfregulation'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","It has become commonly known that self-control is needed to act in line with long-term goals and to shield ourselves from conflicting hedonic goals. Most research on self-regulation strategies focuses on long-term goal pursuit as the successful outcome, while engaging in hedonic goal pursuit is seen as self-control failure. Recent research showed that hedonic goal pursuit, as well as long-term goal pursuit, predicted higher levels of well-being. The aim of the present research is to broaden the consequences of hedonic goal pursuit and to look for possible underlying mechanisms. This study predicts an association between trait hedonic capacity (THC) and happiness and proposes regulatory focus as a possible mediator. A cross-sectional study was conducted, using an online questionnaire which covered (1) regulatory focus, (2) happiness, (3) trait hedonic capacity, (4) demographic statistics (gender, age and level of education). The results showed that THC is positively associated with happiness and the relationship between trait hedonic capacity and happiness was positively mediated by promotion focus and negatively mediated by prevention focus. The present research support a new view on self-regulation, as it showed that hedonic goal pursuit is also associated with higher levels of happiness. Moreover, the results imply that a regulatory focus plays a significant role in the relationship between THC and happiness."
"The relationship between negative affect regulation, positive affect regulation and depression and the moderating effect of gender","['Bom, Tosca van der']","['Boelen, Paul']",2022-08-09T00:02:56Z,EN,[],Clinical Psychology,"Depression is currently the third leading contributor to the global disease burden, and it is expected that it will rise to the first place by 2030. Identifying underlying mechanisms in depression is specifically pressing and could lead to valuable implications for the development of effective psychological treatments. Most of the research on emotion regulation and depression has focused on negative affect (NA) regulation, but there is a growing interest in investigating positive affect (PA) regulation. The aim of the present study was to examine to what extent NA and PA regulation contribute to depression and to investigate whether gender was a moderator of the relationship between NA and PA regulation and depression. The study was conducted in a specialized mental health care facility in the Netherlands, with N = 374 participants. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR) determined depression. The Responses to Positive Affect Questionnaire (RPA-NL), consisted of the subscales dampening and positive rumination, determined PA regulation. The Ruminative Response Scale (RRS-NL), consisted of the subscales brooding and reflection, determined NA regulation. There was a significant correlation found between NA regulation and depression and PA regulation and depression. Results showed that NA regulation was a more important contributor to depression than PA regulation, but looking at NA and PA regulation simultaneously, brooding, dampening and positive rumination made a unique contribution to depression. Gender was not found as a moderator between NA and PA regulation and depression. Concluding, the current study gave insight into the extent to which NA and PA regulation contributes to depression and suggested that NA and PA regulation are important factors associated with depression, which may be relevant to consider in treating depression. Suggestions for further research, limitations of the present study and implications for clinical practice were discussed."
The Influence of Job Demands and Job Resources on Work-life Balance: The Role of Passion for Work,"['Kis, Zsofia']","['IJbema, J.F.']",2022-08-09T00:02:57Z,EN,[],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","In the present study, the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model is used as a framework to investigate the influence of job demands and job resources on individuals’ passion for work and in turn, their work-life balance. Building on the dualistic model of passion (Vallerand, 2015; Bélanger, 2021), I predicted that job demands (i.e., workload) would increase individuals’ obsessive (but not harmonious) passion, which in turn would be positively related to work-life conflict. Conversely, I predicted that job resources (i.e., autonomy, social support) would increase individuals’ harmonious passion, which in turn would lead to work-life balance. I further examined if passion for work (OP vs HP) could mediate the effect of job demands and job resources on work- life balance and work-life conflict. In total, 140 participants were included. I found some support for my model. As expected, as employees were provided with more job resources (i.e., autonomy, social support), they showed higher levels of HP. Whereas as employees were facing more job demands (i.e., workload), they shower higher levels of OP. The results also show a partial mediation effect of OP on the relationship between job demands (i.e., workload) and work-life conflict. In addition, HP also partially mediated the relationship between job resources (i.e., autonomy, social support) and work-life conflict. These findings extend the literature by showing that the influence of job demands and job resources on work-life conflict can be partially explained by individuals’ passion for work. The present study gives insight into the complexities of the relationship between job demands, job resources, passion for work, and the degree to which employees’ work activities are in conflict with other life domains."
Does Executive Compensation Negatively Affect Firm Performance in a Crisis?,"['Visch, Maurits']","['Engelen, Peter Jan']",2022-08-09T00:02:45Z,EN,['Corporate Governance; COVID-19 Crisis; Firm Performance; Executive\nCompensation'],Financial Management,"The goal of this research is to assess the effect of types of executive compensation on firm
performance in the recent COVID-19 crisis in the Netherlands. The reason for this is that
good corporate governance mechanisms depend on organizational and environmental
circumstances, which differed during the COVID-19 crisis. Hence, this research answers the
following research question: ‘What is the role of certain forms of executive compensation on
firm performance during the COVID-19 crisis in the Netherlands?’. The research has been
conducted using a fixed-effects regression analysis from panel data about the Netherlands’ 67
largest listed firms. It can be concluded that incentive executive compensation positively
impacts return on equity during crisis times. Furthermore, total executive compensation
negatively impacts Tobin’s Q during crisis times. However, most effects of types of executive
compensation on firm performance were non-significant in crisis times. Thus, if firms want to
alter their executive compensation, they should apply incentive-style compensation structures
to improve firm performance during crisis times."
