"How Grassroots Organizations Reimagine Girls’ Right to Play Online Games:
 A Qualitative Research Among Sub-Saharan Africa","['Frinking, Hannah']","['Groot, Tjitske de']",2023-10-12T23:00:57Z,EN,"['girls’ right to play, online games, grassroots organizations, gender justice, Sub-Saharan Africa']","Youth, Education and Society","Girls’ right to play is not always evident worldwide, as most spaces are gendered spaces, reflective of gender roles and power dynamics. Girls’ right to play is limited in several areas, including the online gaming playfield. This thesis investigates the role of grassroots organizations among Sub-Saharan Africa in promoting girls’ right to play online games and presents findings from seven grassroots organizations among Sub-Saharan Africa. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was used and identified key pillars related to: (1) girls' access to online games, (2) girls’ empowerment and agency through participation to online games, and (3) the transformative effects of girls’ participation to online games in the community. The findings highlight several gender inequalities girls face in their communities such as gender roles, digital gender divide, poverty and gender-based violence. These inequalities limit girls in their right to play online games. Moreover, the results shed led on the importance of girls to participate in these areas, as participation in online games could improve their skills, reinforce their self-confidence, and could provide economic benefits. Girls’ participation to online games strengthen their social position, as efforts from the grassroots organizations include the involvement of the whole community and men, seeking for collective action and responsibility. The thesis ends with recommendations for practice and future research, such as the inclusion of the experiences of girls who benefit from the strategies employed by grassroots organizations."
"Norms & Adolescent Sexual Health- The Role of Parents, Peers and Religion on Adolescent Sexual Satisfaction through Sexual Emotions","['Baturlar, Ozge']","['Ditzhuijzen, J.M. van']",2023-10-01T00:00:45Z,EN,['adolescent sexuality; injunctive norms; sexual emotions; sexual satisfaction'],"Social Challenges, Policies and Interventions","Adolescence is a crucial period for promoting positive sexual health outcomes. In this study, we aimed to gain insight into the role of injunctive norms about sexuality in adolescents' positive sexual experiences. Using three-wave longitudinal data from 160 adolescent boys and girls in the Netherlands (Mage=15,47, SDage= 1.32), we investigated the impact of injunctive norms from parents, peers, and religion on adolescents' positive (i.e., feeling happy, proud, and loved) and negative (i.e., feeling ashamed, dirty, and guilty) emotional experiences with sex, and whether these emotions could predict their sexual satisfaction. Additionally, we tested the effects of injunctive norms on adolescents' sexual satisfaction through positive and negative emotional experiences with sex. As initial analyses revealed gender differences, we examined these associations separately for boys and girls while taking their age into account. Findings from multiple linear regression analyses showed that for boys, being older was related to experiencing higher levels of positive emotions and lower levels of sexual satisfaction. Moreover, perceiving parents as more sexually approving and peers as less sexually approving were related to experiencing higher levels of sexual satisfaction, but these associations were not mediated by positive nor negative emotional experiences. For girls, perceiving parents as more sexually approving was related to higher levels of positive emotions. Both for boys and girls, experiencing negative emotions with sex seems to be a factor that might hinder sexual satisfaction. Overall, our study findings show that adolescents' perception of what is (dis)approved by their parents and peers interferes with their positive sexual outcomes. Moreover, it highlights the role of gender in shaping various aspects of adolescents' sexual experiences. These insights highlight the necessity of sex education in promoting equality and addressing biases related to social norms, gender, and sexuality."
Exploring Preferences and Acceptbaility of Policies to Reduce Socioeconomic Inequalities in Health Across Various Social Groups - A Cross-Sectional Study in the Netherlands,"['Dietzfelbinger, Lea']","['Kamphuis, Carlijn']",2023-09-30T00:01:25Z,EN,"['Preference, Public Acceptability, Socioeconomic Policies, Health \nInequalities']","Social Challenges, Policies and Interventions","This study explores acceptability and preference for policy approaches addressing 
socioeconomic inequalities in health in the Netherlands. Sixteen relevant policies were 
classified as structural, agento-structural, agentic, and process policy (public involvement). 
A cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2023 among Dutch-speaking individuals aged 
18 and above, living in the Netherlands. A non-probability (snowball and convenience) 
sampling method was used to distribute the survey via various social media channels and 
existing contacts. Acceptability was measured on a seven-point Likert scale. To assess the 
preference of policies, respondents were required to pick three policies they considered most 
important in reducing socioeconomic inequalities in health. Educational level, measured by 
the highest degree, was used to assess respondents´ socioeconomic status (SES), categorised 
in two groups. Covariates included were age, gender, employment status, being a welfare 
recipient, working in the social or health domain and perceived responsibility. 87% of the 
participants (N=331) had high and 13% low or middle education backgrounds. In general, 
agento-structural policies received high acceptability and preference scores. The quality of 
social housing and public involvement received high scores of acceptability, respectively 
preference. Education did not show any differencesin the acceptability of either of the policy 
types. Differences were observed in the preference: individuals with low/ middle educational 
levels scored higher on structural policies while individuals with high educational levels 
scored higher on agento-structural policies. Yet, the regression analysis did not show
educational level as a significant predictor of acceptability and preference. Age, gender, and
perceived responsibility were positively related with all four policy types, serving as 
covariates. Non-welfare recipients showed higher acceptability towards agentic policies and 
lower preference towards structural policies. Dutch policymakers should prioritize agento-
structural policies and particularly focus on improving the quality of social housing. A
participatory approach involving various stakeholders is recommended to reduce 
socioeconomic health disparities."
Shaping How Others See Us: Utilising Beauty Practices for Social Influence and Public Imaging in the 15th Century,"['Feodorov, Hannah']","['Versendaal, Rozanne']",2023-09-30T23:01:13Z,EN,['Beauty; 15th century; Women; Social mobility; Self-fashioning'],"Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance Studies","15th-century ideas around female beauty and beauty culture were just as nuanced as today's. With strong cultural ideas around beauty and behaviour as a reflection of inner virtue, French and Italian women used cosmetics and idealised images to adhere to the beauty standard. This thesis asks to what extent elite women's application of these beauty practices could be used to facilitate social influence. This thesis addresses the gap between scholarly discussions of beauty as a concept and how cultural expectations changed how beauty practices could be applied throughout the different stages of elite women's lives. Through an analysis of selected texts and passages by 15th-century authors Isabella d'Este, Anne of France, Christine de Pizan, and Laura Cereta, this thesis will examine how these female authors viewed beauty and women's application of beauty practices through three stages of life. This thesis will examine the three stages of unmarried youth, becoming a young married woman, and finally entering old age and widowhood. For each stage of life, the chapters will analyse textual and visual sources through the lens of self-fashioning as a tool for self-representation and female agency."
How Translocality Shapes Dutch-Cape Verdean Families,"['Eeckhout, Mare van den']","['Zoomers, Annelies']",2023-09-30T00:01:14Z,EN,['Cape Verdeans; Dutch-Cape Verdeans; Families; Translocality; Transnationalism; Translocal Families; Transnational Families; Migration; Identity; Remittances; Translocal Family Relationships'],International Development Studies,"Cape Verde is a country with a rich and long migration history, which has led to the belief
that there are more Cape Verdeans that live outside of the country borders than within. Cape
Verdean migration flows span across the whole world, meaning that Cape Verdean families
often are scattered throughout different places. This dispersion has led to many families
maintaining families across between the different places, creating translocal relationships.
Not only does translocality influence these families, but also the individual family members.
This research therefore sets out to examine the role of translocality for Dutch-Cape Verdean
families and their members. This is done by focusing on the role of translocality for the actual
relationships within these families as well as other types of networks, for the identity
formation of the individual members, and for translocal practices that are important for the
Dutch-Cape Verdean families. This is done by exploring the views and experiences of
several members within these translocal families, both in the Netherlands and in Cape Verde.

This thesis uses a qualitative research design and the primary data was collected through
personal surveys in the form of face-to-face conversations and in-depth interviews. To ensure
that both the family members that moved away and those who stayed were properly
included, the fieldwork was split in two. The first half of the research was carried out in the
Netherlands, particularly in Rotterdam, to delve into the perspectives and experiences of the
Cape Verdean members that migrated to the Netherlands. The second half of the fieldwork
took place in Cape Verde, on Sao Vicente and Santiago. Here, the perspectives of the
members that stayed in Cape Verde were researched.

The outcome of this research shows that translocality plays a vital role for the
relationships of Dutch-Cape Verdean families. Translocality also has a big impact on the
individual family members, through identity formation, different types of relationships and
networks, and the translocal practice of remittances."
BOTTO-UP FLOOD MANAGEMENT AND ITS IMPACT ON LIVELIHOOD IN JAKARTA,"['Dessyta Octavera Santi, Dessyta']","['Batubara, Bosman']",2023-09-30T00:01:32Z,EN,['flood management; bottom-up; community; participation; livelihoods'],International Development Studies,"The past research illustrates top-down flood management in Jakarta since the colonial era 400 years ago. One of the common flood managements offered by Jakarta’s local government is through a river rehabilitation project, evicting riverbank settlements. By taking a bottom-up approach, this qualitative research aims to reveal the bottom-up flood management practices conducted by three kampungs in north Jakarta: Kampung Tongkol, Kampung Lodan, and Kampung Krapu, organized by KAKC (Komunitas Anak Kali Ciliwung/Ciliwung Sub-River Community). In response to the eviction threat, KAKC proposed a “Penataan Kampung (Kampung Maintenance)” concept instead of eviction. This effort is not only to protect them from eviction but also to be part of the city’s flood management as a whole. This paper presents the existing flood management conducted and the upcoming practices designed by KAKC.
Recently, numerous development programs, including flood management, often transformed the source of livelihoods, and that transformation significantly impacted the livelihood security of vulnerable groups. Therefore, KAKC and its community feared not only losing their house but also their workplace as their source of living. Losing both house and a source of living would significantly worsen the financial situation and well-being of the already poor households.
The research’s findings were drawn from field visits with ethnography methods, photo elicitation, in-depth interviews, and random small discussion sessions with KAKC members and the inhabitants of three kampungs. This research found that flood management practices by KAKC illustrate an unconventional approach as an alternative to common flood management derived from hydrologists’ ideas, which is dominant with big infrastructures such as canal systems, dredging, clearing, and normalization of river projects. It proves that KAKC, as a local community, have their own approach and depicts its crucial role in the development process. KAKC practices in flood management illustrate more active and quasi-participation instead of passive. Lastly, flood management and livelihoods are mutually interconnected and impact each other."

Additionally, it is expected that organizational commitment will at least partially mediate the relationship between democratic leadership style and performance."
THE IMPACT OF REVASCULARIZATION SURGERY ON HEADACHE IN PATIENTS WITH MOYAMOYA,"['Gallego Moyano, Daniela']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-09-30T23:00:49Z,EN,[],Medicine,"Background and Aims: Significant headache in moyamoya vasculopathy is not uncommon but the pathophysiology is poorly understood. We aimed to investigate if headache in moyamoya patients improves after revascularization surgery and whether this is associated with improvement in cerebrovascular reactivity.
Methods: For this single-center retrospective study, adult patients with moyamoya vasculopathy who underwent extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery between January- 2010 and September-2022 were selected from a database with consecutive patients who had MRI with cerebrovascular reactivity studies. Clinical data including a headache history and imaging data were collected through systematic chart review. We assessed the association between headache and cerebrovascular reactivity before and after uni- or bilateral revascularization surgery.
Results: Fifty-one patients were included (mean age 4213 years, 37 women (73%)). Thirty- three patients (65%) had bilateral moyamoya vasculopathy and 14 (27.5%) underwent bilateral extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery. Thirty-five patients (69%) reported headache pre-surgery. Features included: episodic headache (96%), preceding aura (12%), predominantly throbbing headache (47%) with nausea/vomiting (39%), and/or photo/phonophobia (11%); 62% of patients lost workdays because of headache.
Headache improved in 24/35 (69%) patients after surgery with reduction in pain severity (median VAS from 7 to 3; p <0.01) and sick leave (62% to 19%; p=0.0024). CVR improved in 25/38 (66%) patients who had pre- and post-surgery CVR-MRI, which was associated with headache improvement (OR:13; 95%CI: 1.3-124). Younger age was also associated with headache improvement post-surgery (OR:0.88; 95%CI: 0.81-0.96).
Conclusions: Headache in moyamoya vasculopathy improved in most patients after revascularization surgery and was associated with improvement in cerebrovascular reactivity, supporting the hypothesis of a vascular origin of the headache."
"3D Human Reconstruction on the Multi-View,
In-The-Wild, YOUth data","['Kalyuzhnyy, Vlad']","['Poppe, Ronald']",2023-10-01T00:00:52Z,EN,['2D Pose Estimation; Camera Calibration; 3D Human Reconstruction'],Artificial Intelligence,"The main goal of this research thesis is to retrieve three dimensional human body models, of the parent and
infant, depicted in the private YOUth dataset, from multiple uncalibrated cameras. The previous research in
this area is primarily reliant on ground-truth annotations of two dimensional poses across the multi-view data
or the prior knowledge of the camera parameters. To this end, we develop a mechanism which bridges two
dimensional pose estimation methods with camera calibration and three dimensional human reconstruction
models. To reliably achieve our goal, we study the mechanisms of top-down and bottom-up two dimensional pose estimation methods, as well as, one-stage and two-stage three dimensional human reconstruction
strategies. To link the data between these different models, we develop a pipeline which identifies the same
individual across sequential frames and different points of view, ensuring to accommodate for missing, or redundant, information. We quantify the quality of the reconstruction based on the estimated two dimensional
pose data. The study of the qualitative results show the implications of challenges, such as occlusions and two
dimensional pose detection ambiguities, which cannot be accounted for in the absence of ground-truth pose
annotations or ground-truth camera parameters."
Properties and Applications of Hawkes Processes,"['Bergman, Peggy']","['Ruszel, Wioletta']",2023-09-30T23:01:16Z,EN,[],Mathematical Sciences,"Point processes in probability theory are special stochastic processes which model the occurrence 

of events (points) in some space and parameterized by their frequency. Hawkes 

processes are general point processes where the frequency can be self-exciting or mutually 

exciting. They occur in various areas such as geological sciences, epidemiology and financial 

mathematics. The focus of this thesis lies in discussing different types of Hawkes processes 

and their properties as well as presenting financial applications. The (linear) Hawkes process 

or self-exciting Hawkes process is a process with a single counting process such that that the 

occurrence of an event increases the probability of the occurrence of another event. In the 

case of the (linear) Hawkes process, we prove the Law of Large Numbers and the Central 

Limit Theorem. Moreover, we study the Hawkes likelihood function and the Hawkes loglikelihood 

function. Besides a self-exciting Hawkes process there exists a mutually exciting 

Hawkes process, which is a process with multiple counting processes that are depended on 

each other. Meaning that the occurrence of an event in one of these counting processes 

also lead to an increased probability of an event occurring in the other counting processes. 

We study the Hawkes likelihood function and the Hawkes log-likelihood function for the 

mutually exciting Hawkes process. The marked Hawkes process is a (linear) Hawkes process 

with added random variables called the random marks. We prove the Hawkes likelihood 

function and the Hawkes log-likelihood function as well as the Central Limit Theorem. 

Furthermore, we derive the dynamics for the Hawkes jump-diffusion model given by three 

stochastic differential equations and prove the Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit 

Theorem for this particular model."

"Urban Renewal and Disconnect: Varying Perceptions on the Value of Urban Development in Tbilisi, Georgia","['Kotzias, Nikos-Pavlos']","['Martins Sampaio, Dora']",2023-10-17T01:01:20Z,EN,['Territorial Stigma; Urban Renewal; Tbilisi; Georgia; Sustainable Urban Development; Dispossession; Developing Cities; Community Fabric'],International Development Studies,"In recent years, many cities in the developing world have been experiencing explosive upwards and outwards growth, with economic development often outpacing the capacity of citizens to adapt. A key tool in the reconfiguration of the urban space can be found in Urban Renewal, as an attempt to reverse and prevent decay. Urban renewal, in theory and practice, is often presented as the all-encompassing solution to existing problems whilst simultaneously enabling for further development, particularly in terms of bringing different stakeholders together. However, the degree to which urban renewal facilitates such an interaction, supplementing an integrated planning strategy that empowers and includes local communities remains largely unexplored. In most developed cities, urban renewal has had an eroding effect on the community fabric and used to mask or justify inequality and segregation. As such, the present research serves an examination of whether a similar process can occur in a developing setting. It set out to conceptualise and rationalise urban change by investigating whether urban renewal in Tbilisi has contributed to a sense of ‘disconnect’ between residents and institutions.

This paper examined existing literature on urban renewal and drew comparisons with data gathered from Tbilisi. A survey with 62 residents, 30 interviews, an analysis of secondary data and local media attempted to understand the effects urban renewal has had on the connectedness of different stakeholders, primarily through an exploration of territorial stigma.

The results of the research confirmed the complexity of the urban experience and the multiplicity of adaptation strategies towards –desirable or undesirable- change. It claims that urban renewal has indeed contributed to disconnect, a dual widening gap between residents and their institutions, as well as between residents themselves. It uncovered how urban renewal has failed to address perennial issues, formalised inequality, challenged notions of possession, and fundamentally altered the enfranchisement of residents in relation to change. Nevertheless, the study also acknowledges the centrality of context in being able to attribute or substantiate the interlocking of disconnect with any of these phenomena. This proves that further and more systematic research is necessary, while also proposing an enhanced understanding of urban renewal, marginality, and territorial stigma as analytic tools. Therefore, it concluded that any branding of urban renewal as 'sustainable,’ even when employed exploratively, ought to be approached with caution, particularly in terms of transparency, optimisation, and emancipation."
Binnenstedelijke gebiedsontwikkelingen in de stikstofcrisis,"['Munnik, Lynn de']","['Buitelaar, Edwin']",2023-10-17T01:01:08Z,NL,['Binnenstedelijke gebiedsontwikkelingen; stikstof; wet- en regelgeving; gemeenten; projectontwikkelaars; doorlooptijd.'],Spatial Planning,"De vergrote aandacht voor de stikstofdepositie van gebiedsontwikkelingen op Natura 2000-gebieden is in lijn met de duurzaamheidsgedachte die de afgelopen jaren binnen de maatschappij heerst. Het juridische kader die voor de reductie van de stikstofdepositie bestaat, kent sinds de vernietiging van het Programma Aanpak Stikstof in 2019 een grote hoeveelheid aan wijzigingen. Daardoor heeft Nederland de afgelopen vier jaar te maken gehad met een stikstofcrisis die voor maatschappelijke en politieke onrust zorgde. Uit de huidige wetenschappelijke kennis blijkt dat wijzigende, strenge, onduidelijke en/of te veel wetten en regels invloed kunnen hebben op de doorlooptijd van gebiedsontwikkelingen. Dit schept de verwachting dat stikstofwet- en regelgeving de doorlooptijd van binnenstedelijke gebiedsontwikkelingen kan beïnvloeden. Toch is dit nog niet eerder onderzocht. Daarom beoogt het onderhavige onderzoek deze kenniskloof op te lossen. De focus ligt hierbij op de invloed die gemeenten en/of projectontwikkelaars op de werking van stikstofwet- en regelgeving op de doorlooptijd kunnen hebben. Deze focus is in het licht van de huidige woningnood in Nederland van belang, omdat potentiële vertraging door stikstofwet- en regelgeving dient te worden voorkomen. Zodoende hanteert het onderzoek de volgende onderzoeksvraag: “Hoe kunnen gemeenten en/of projectontwikkelaars invloed hebben op de werking van de stikstofwet- en regelgeving op binnenstedelijke gebiedsontwikkelingen, in het bijzonder op de doorlooptijd?”.

De onderzoeksvraag wordt onderzocht aan de hand van casusonderzoek naar twee geselecteerde binnenstedelijke gebiedsontwikkelingen. Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd middels het verrichten van een literatuurstudie naar de bestaande wetenschappelijke kennis, bureauonderzoeken naar de vigerende stikstofwet- en regelgeving en de context van de casussen én het afnemen van diepte-interviews met betrokken respondenten bij de casussen. Hieruit is gebleken dat de belangrijkste knelpunten in de stikstofwet- en regelgeving voor de doorlooptijd van binnenstedelijke gebiedsontwikkelingen de vele wijzigingen, het restrictieve karakter en de onduidelijkheid zijn. Deze knelpunten leiden echter niet automatisch tot vertraging, vanwege de enige mate van vrijheid die er bestaat voor gemeenten en/of projectontwikkelaars om een invulling te kunnen geven aan de toepassing van de stikstofwet- en regelgeving. In de stikstofwet- en regelgeving bestaat namelijk geringe mate van bestuurlijke afwegingsruimte en enige mate van handelingsruimte. Belangrijk bij de omgang met de stikstofwet- en regelgeving blijkt het reduceren van onzekerheid en risico’s tijdens de planvormingsfase, maar ook om soms wel risico’s te blijven nemen. Toch toont het casusonderzoek ook aan dat gemeenten en/of projectontwikkelaars niet altijd in staat zijn de potentiële vertragende invloed van de stikstofwet- en regelgeving te voorkomen. Indien er té veel wijzigingen plaatsvinden en grote onduidelijkheid is, kan het lastig worden de negatieve gevolgen van de stikstofwet- en regelgeving te beperken. Ook is de werking van de stikstofwet- en regelgeving context- en tijdsafhankelijk, wat de invloed van gemeenten en/of projectontwikkelaars kan beperken. Concluderend valt dus te stellen dat gemeenten en/of projectontwikkelaars invloed hebben op werking van de stikstofwet- en regelgeving op de doorlooptijd van binnenstedelijke gebiedsontwikkelingen, maar dat deze invloed door verschillende factoren belemmerd kan worden.

Deze uitkomst van het onderzoek nuanceert de bestaande wetenschappelijke kennis over de werking van wet- en regelgeving op de doorlooptijd van gebiedsontwikkelingen. Het toont aan de deze werking deels afhankelijk is van de manier waarop er mee om wordt gegaan. Daarnaast is de werking ook deels context- en tijdsafhankelijk."

This research project aims to determine the impacts on local people’s livelihoods and the three main sustainable dimensions of EU-funded green transition projects in rural areas in Western Spain. The case study to demonstrate so is the Francisco Pizarro solar plant, the largest in Europe. Climate change has had a negative impact on people’s livelihoods all over the world lately. Renewable energy projects are the ones to help keep them under control, eventually. The entire socioeconomic framework cannot be understood as separated from the green energy transition as shifts in the renewable energy system impact the economy. The methodology applied to develop this research is mainly qualitative, but there are also some quantitative inputs. Semi-structured research interviews and participant observation were carried out through the in-field internship to collect the required data. The results obtained from the data collected in the fieldwork demonstrate that the impact of this specific case study on local people’s livelihoods in rural areas in Western Spain depends mainly on local authorities. They are responsible for developing several social initiatives to improve local people’s livelihoods. They conclude that there is a lack of monitoring and policy initiatives from the regional government and the company to ensure that these macro renewable energy projects positively impact local people’s livelihoods as they are doing at the economic and environmental levels."

The Effect of the Meaning and Experience of Place on Mapping Behaviour,"['Kerkhof, Amber van de']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-10-17T01:01:15Z,EN,['Platial;Places;Mapping Behaviour;Place Attachment;Cartographic Experiment;Eindhoven'],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"This thesis researches the role of platial connection and personal demographic and geographic characteristics on an individual’s mapping behaviour. Recently, individuals increasingly use their geographic voice by participating in crowd-sourced and voluntary geographic data collection and visualisation. Simultaneously, there is a demand for better understanding places and how the meaning of place can be portrayed in maps. By investigating the connection of mapping behaviour as influenced by the extent to which people feel a platial relationship, the understanding of individual influences on mapping initiatives can be understood better, together with gaining insights in how to research mapping behaviour.

A self-administered online questionnaire including interactive mapping exercises was carried out. Participants performed mapping exercises of five secondary schools (of which they attended one; three schools inside Eindhoven, two outside Eindhoven) by tracing the geometry on aerial images of the area they saw as belonging to that place. The mapped area size, number of placed nodes and time spent on the exercise constitute the variable ‘mapping behaviour’. Questions relating to the personal relationship with those places were also included, together with personal demographic and cartographic questions. The data was analysed quantitatively through linear mixed effect models and qualitatively. Schools were chosen to portray ‘locational familiarity’, places that cause relationships based on the location instead of their thematic function.

This study showed that the personal platial relationships with specific places do affect the way individuals map these places, both quantitatively (in ways of included areas, time spent on mapping and the usage of nodes) and qualitatively through used language. The personal demographic and geographic characteristics are of less impact and require further study to rule out their significance. Due to the limitations of the available cartographic research tools for designing mapping experiments and the limited data sample, future research can add on this exploratory study by looking into additional mapping behaviour variables and the inclusion of different types of places that allow for parametric sampling."
Partnership-led Regeneration of Heritage Protection Zones,"['Kobosilová, Tereza']","['Friendly, Abigail']",2023-10-17T00:00:44Z,EN,"['heritage, partnership, participation, urban and rural regeneration, heritage protection zones, conservation areas']",Spatial Planning,"Like all parts of our environment, designated historic areas, whether urban or rural, are under pressure to adapt to social, economic and climatic challenges. It is, therefore, important to actively manage their development alongside their legal protection. In recent years, an integrated approach to heritage in planning aimed at sustainable heritage development has gained increasing theoretical and practical support. As the concept of integration is based on the realisation of a shared vision, the incorporation of participatory practices is considered essential for the successful regeneration of historic areas.

However, to what extent this is the reality in practice with already designated heritage assets varies largely from case to case. The governance structure and participation procedures in existing heritage protection zones and their impact on their development remain a largely under-researched issue. In order to explore how the participation of the public sector, the private sector and civil society can enhance protection and development in heritage protection zones, two partnership programmes aimed at regenerating heritage zones were studied. Within the context of the Dutch protective instrument of “beschermde stads- en dorpsgezichten”, the analysis of the municipal scheme Dorpsontwikkelingsmaatschappij shows how the Frisian village of Ee tackled the issues of physical deterioration of the historic built environment and economic decline through a collaboration between the province, the municipality and citizens. To explore governance in England's 'conservation areas', the case of the Heritage Action Zone programme, which has been applied in several conservation areas across the country, shows how collaboration between Historic England, local authorities, NGOs and citizens has helped to improve a physically and economically deprived historic area in the city of Sunderland.

The case studies show that cultural heritage status does not necessarily imply a restriction on development, but rather can be seen as an opportunity for further activities in the area. The Dutch and English examples demonstrate how top-down measures can initiate or enhance bottom-up initiatives in protected areas in different ways, thereby strengthening the protection of the area and encouraging its further development. Heritage protection zones and other protective instruments play a significant role in preserving our cultural heritage. However, merely regulating the development within these areas falls short of securing their long-term future. Therefore, governing bodies must take measures and encourage active cooperation and participation in historic urban areas to enable them to adapt to changing times."

Findings indicate differing impacts, PT MPG (steam power plants) negatively impacts most livelihood capitals except the financial capital, while PT Socfindo (palm oil plantation and CPO factories) exhibits positive impacts on livelihood capitals except the natural capital. These findings support the idea that FDI within the same category can exhibit different impacts that depend on company management, regional policies, and local institutions. The study also emphasizes that resource-based FDI leads to inevitable negative impacts on local environments, but the severity of it can be reduced.

With a predominant emphasis on migration from the south to north countries, which constitutes only 15% of total global migration, the influence of migration within the Global South—comprising 85% of global migration—remains inadequately explored. Addressing this gap, the research sheds light on the under examined topic of south-south migration, specifically investigating the contributions of Syrian refugees to Lebanon's development. Syria stands as the world's largest producer of refugees. Among its neighboring countries, Lebanon, alongside Turkey and Pakistan, hosts 30% of the global refugee population. As such, Lebanon holds the highest per-capita number of refugees, with more than a quarter of its population composed of refugees. However, this study employs a dual methodology including in-depth interviews and life narratives, engaging a diverse cohort of 44 participants, incorporating representatives from NGOs, host community members, and refugees themselves. The findings of this research highlight that Syrian refugees in Lebanon contribute to the country's development in various dimensions. The majority of refugees in this research actively engage in fostering new markets, introducing new skills, establishing cross-border connections, and stimulating the local economy, thereby contributing to local development. However, this research also shows that the extent of refugees' contributions is influenced by the challenges they confront. Additionally, the role played by NGOs in facilitating refugees' involvement in development-related activities also holds a key role."
Justice in Soil Governance: A Critical Discourse Analysis of Stakeholders' Justice Perspectives Regarding the Proposed EU Soil Health Law,"['Hanson, Pia']","['Kalfagianni, Agni']",2023-11-02T01:02:08Z,EN,[],Sustainable Development,"Soils are of critical importance to human societies, as they provide a host of ecosystem services and harbor roughly a quarter to a third of all living things on Earth; soil degradation and biodiversity loss are pressing sustainability issues at both the global and the EU level. While soil degradation has a number of justice dimensions, there is relatively little academic work that explicitly makes the link between justice and soil governance. This thesis aims to provide a better understanding of stakeholders’ justice perspectives regarding EU soil health policy and how these perspectives may relate to stakeholder coalitions and policy proposals for the EU Soil Health Law proposed in 2022.
To this end, the thesis augments the pluralistic justice framework developed by Biermann and Kalfagianni (2020) to include multispecies justice perspectives alongside liberal-egalitarianism, cosmopolitanism, the capabilities approach, libertarianism, and critical perspectives. The research follows principles of critical discourse analysis to analyze statements made by 31 stakeholders regarding EU soil policy in the context of past developments in EU soil initiatives and identify stakeholders’ perspectives and policy proposals. The dimensions of justice that are considered in this analysis are subjects, spatial scales, temporal scales, causes of injustice, and justice mechanisms. Insights from the Advocacy Coalition Framework are used to supplement the analysis and gain a better understanding of coalition dynamics and their potential implications for the development of EU soil policy. The analysis was conducted on a sample of statements made by 31 out of a total of 189 stakeholders that gave feedback to the European Commission’s 2022 Call for Evidence for the proposed EU Soil Health Law.
The results of this research indicate that all justice perspectives included in the analysis can be identified in statements made by the 31 stakeholders. The most common justice perspectives identified in the statements are libertarianism and liberal egalitarianism. These findings align with past developments in EU soil policy, as libertarian perspectives appear to have played a crucial role in past opposition to EU soil legislation. The analysis of stakeholder statements also identifies two main existing coalitions, one around a libertarian justice perspective and another coalition comprised mainly of civil society actors around a mixture of justice perspectives. While there are a number of policy proposals shared primarily by stakeholders within each of these two coalitions, the analysis also found policy proposals shared by stakeholders across and beyond these coalitions. The findings illustrate the potential of an analysis of justice perspectives to identify and understand stakeholder coalitions and policy proposals. They also imply that EU policymakers should consider the dominant justice perspectives and coalitions among stakeholders when trying to develop effective soil policies, as these appear to have an influence on the positions of decisionmakers from EU Member States."
BUSINESS CASE EFFECTS OF A BATTERY ACTING ON THE AFRR MARKET COMBINED WITH INTRADAY CHARGE MANAGEMENT,"['Verbeij, Rob']","['Kramer, Gert Jan']",2023-11-02T01:01:54Z,EN,"['Battery, aFRR, intraday, businesscases effect']",Energy Science,"The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources for electricity generation has made it increasingly difficult to match supply and demand on the grid. This creates an increasing demand for flexible power to respond to grid needs. A battery energy storage system (BESS) is an example of a flexible asset.
First, the added value of BESS for the electricity system was investigated. It can be concluded that adding BESS for grid stabilization reduces the imbalance price and thus makes renewable energy projects more financially attractive due to lower imbalance costs. A BESS can contribute to imbalance cost reduction in two ways: actively or passively balancing. Active means that participation is preselected through bidding, with the transmission system operator (TSO) providing the connection and activation. Passive balancing means a voluntary contribution to grid imbalance, stimulated by live publication of imbalance prices. The entry of BESS reduces imbalance costs for both forms of balancing, compared to a scenario where batteries do not enter. In the general sense of grid stabilization, it can be said that active balancing is more efficient way of balancing, however, creates a smaller supply of available power overall.
The provision of active balancing power, is done through the automatic frequency restoration reserve market (aFRR). However, the choice deployment for BESS should not only be made on the basis of grid stabilization, there should also be responsible financial compensation in return.
This thesis research investigates how a BESS can bid into the aFRR market with its full power and the added value of this market on a battery's business case. Using literature and published documents from TenneT, the conditions a BESS must meet to be able to bid its full power have been identified. It has been found that a BESS can offer its full power by applying charge management supported by an intraday energy transaction Next, this study examines the data flows required in Scholt Energy organizational structure to make this possible. From this, it appears that the current organizational structure allows for the control of aFRR combined with intraday charge management, but means that data communication of purchased intraday deals goes through Scholt Energy. Technical simplification and the added value of market stacking occurs the moment it is possible to connect to the extended crowd balancing platform (CBP) for aFRR delivery. Here the involved parties for aFRR delivery, intraday charge management and BESS control are all connected.
After having established how a BESS can legally and organizationally participate with its full capacity in the aFRR market, the possible financial outcome has been investigated. This involved investigating the returns of different battery dimensions (being different power to storage ratios) on the aFRR market. This was done by modelling four bidding strategies. The models were run based on the historical revenue achieved in 2021, 2022 and 2023, where 2023 outcomes were based on the first quarter and extrapolated. From the outcome it can be indicated that in 2022, BESS revenues on aFRR were highest, followed by 2023 and lastly 2021.
Revenue from just the aFRR market needs to be put into perspective against other markets to which the battery has access. The comparison model compares the revenues of the aFRR revenue model with historically achieved revenues of a battery in the Frequency Restoration Reserve (FCR) and imbalance market. This shows that the aFRR market does give a significant increase on a battery's revenues, even when the balance Service Provider (BSP) does not have perfect foresight on the profitability of each market. For a future scenario, this effect is even greater.
This same effect can be seen for payback period of the BESS. Here, it has been found that the payback time of a BESS ...."
Analyzing long-term sand wave patterns in the Marsdiep Inlet,"['Geessinck, Lieke']","['Vegt, Maarten van der']",2023-11-02T01:02:02Z,EN,['sand waves; ADCP; tidal currents; Marsdiep inlet; Texel; Wadden Sea; tidal basin'],Marine Sciences,"The Marsdiep inlet is a part of the Wadden Sea, located between Den Helder and Texel in the Netherlands. It
is four kilometers wide, has a depth of maximally 27 meter and is dominated by semi-diurnal tidal currents.
Sand waves are present on the sea bed of the Marsdiep, and they migrate under the influence of tidal currents.
It is important to investigate these bed form features, to gain better understanding in their characteristics
and migration. Two Acoustic Current Doppler Profilers (ADCPs) are mounted under a ferry, which crosses
the inlet up to 32 times a day. The ADCPs measure the depth of the sea at 8 different locations per second
when the ferry is crossing the inlet, this data was collected from 2010 to 2021. The data was corrected for
tides and geometry, placed in grid cells and averaged over one month. The study area was divided into
3 parts, where subsequent sand waves were clearly visible. The sand wave characteristics were analyzed
and tracked over time. The most northern area has symmetrical sand waves with an average height and
wavelength of 2.16 m and 144 m, respectively. The sand waves did not migrate in the direction of the
currents, probably because the area is deep, and currents are weaker at deeper levels. This was not observed
by previous research. A seasonal cycle was found in the first four years of the data, with higher sand waves
during summer with respect to winter months, which was also observed by previous research. The second
area was located in the south of the inlet, but was hard to analyze because one large anomaly was present
during the first 6 years of the analysis. The sand waves had a height and wavelength of 3.64 m and 187 m,
respectively, and they migrated about 70 m per year, on average. The most southern part analysed in this
research was the most stable during the 11 years. It had a sand wave height and length of 2.9 m and 114
m, respectively, and the sand waves migrated on average 80 m per year. The methods for determining the
sand wave heights worked quite good, but the methods to find the other characteristics can be improved, for
example by cross-correlation techniques."

Passive acoustic monitoring is used to monitor vocal activity of birds, which play a key role in forest ecosystems as seed dispersers. Communication between birds seems most profitable during a peak of bird singing in the morning, known as the dawn chorus. Anthropogenic disturbances leading to increased light levels affect the timing of this chorus in individual species. This research sheds a light on the effect of forest restoration on the dawn chorus using automatic detection methods to identify bird sounds from acoustic data. Machine learning methods like clustering and pattern matching were used alongside a manual analysis to describe the dawn chorus in protected forests as well as restoration sites around Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. 
Restoration sites were found to have lower species richness and increased interference from insect sounds. No difference was found between timing of the dawn chorus in both forest habitats. This can possibly be assigned to changes in community composition and decreased detectability of species in insect-dominated landscapes. Future research could further disentangle these effects, by filtering of acoustic data, development of workflow pathways and the use of stronger machine learning methods that allow for more reliable species-specific detection. In the current state of automatic acoustic methods, close cooperation with local experts is recommended to achieve effective monitoring in tropical rainforests."

The aim of this study was to explore the effects of cognitive distortions on internalizing problems, and uncover whether gender differences exist within this relationship. Method Data from 535 adolescents (260 boys and 275 girls) aged twelve to nineteen were analyzed in a cross-sectional design. Self-reported questionnaires examined adolescents’ cognitive distortion levels, clustered in subscales of self-centering, blaming others, minimizing/mislabeling and assuming the worst, as well as internalizing problem levels. Results T-tests revealed that cognitive distortions were more prevalent in boys compared to girls, while girls reported higher rates of internalizing problems. Furthermore, correlation effects revealed that higher rates of cognitive distortions were found to relate to increasing internalizing problems. No significant moderation effects were found for gender in the relationship between cognitive distortions and internalizing problems. Conclusion This study was the first to examine whether gender differences play a role the association between cognitive distortions and internalizing problems. The lack of significant moderation effects indicates that boys and girls dealing with depression or anxiety do not require different treatment approaches regarding cognitive distortions. However, more research is necessary to establish a comprehensive picture of how this relationship is shaped."

Current treatments are hampered by the avascularity of the tissue and eventually do not provide an appropriate tissue repair, especially in the long term. Biofabrication techniques have been taking hold in the cartilage regeneration field to develop potential alternatives to current treatments. However, scaffolds lack to resemble the native tissue both biologically and in terms of mechanical properties. The inclusion of cells in scaffolds was shown to allow degradation to occur in tandem with tissue formation and the use of 3D culture systems can potentially lead to a more precise resemblance of the natural cell microenvironment. The aim of this study was to use extrusion-based bioprinting to deposit Articular cartilage chondroprogenitor cells (ACPCs) aggregates included in gelatin methacryloyl (gelMA) inside melt electrowritten “box-like” scaffolds. We aimed to reproduce both the cartilage component and the fibre-reinforcing component of the native tissue by converging the two biofabrication techniques, together with the use for the first time of ACPCs aggregates. In this study, we bioprinted on top of flat and tilted surfaces, showing the possibility to fabricate scaffolds with anatomically relevant angles, thus shapes. The metabolic activity was investigated and no significant difference was found over 7 days, suggesting its mantainance over the evaluated period of time. Upon quantification of the aggregate viability, no significant difference was found over the same period on top of flat and tilted substrates. This study suggests that the combination of extrusion-based bioprinting of aggregates and melt electrowriting is promising to achieve implants tailored according to anatomically relevant shapes."

Assessing the Performance of a Hebbian Learning Rule in Semi-Supervised Learning,"['Klock, Oscar']","['Berger, Florian']",2023-11-30T00:00:59Z,EN,"['Neural Network, Machine Learning, Hebbian, Semi-Supervised, Brain-inspired']",Neuroscience and Cognition,"Imagine you’re trying to teach a young child to identify different objects,
like apples, bananas, or shoes. If you show them only a few pictures of each
item, they might struggle to recognize these objects in various forms. But, as
you show them more pictures and examples, they get better at identifying them.
Now, consider computer models that work similarly. They need examples (or
data) to learn and recognize patterns.

This study investigated how different computer models learned to recognize
two types of patterns: handwritten numbers (from the MNIST dataset) and
different clothing items, like shirts and shoes (from the Fashion MNIST dataset).
These datasets are like the picture books you’d show a child, but for computers.
The computer models Recurrent Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural
Network (R-BCPNN) and the Feedforward BCPNN (FF-BCPNN) were the
main models. ”Recurrent” means the model has a memory of sorts — it can
recall past information, much like how our brains remember past experiences.
”Feedforward” on the other hand, doesn’t have this memory feature. These
were benchmarked against other, similar, models.

The study found that the R-BCPNN, was especially good at recognizing
patterns even when there weren’t many labeled examples to learn from. It’s like
a child seeing many pictures of apples but only a few have the text ”apple”.
This is crucial in real-world scenarios where we often don’t have thousands of
labeled examples to teach our models. In such situations, the R-BCPNN shines,
showing its potential in ”semi-supervised learning”. This term means that the
model is learning with both labeled examples (like a picture of an apple labeled
”apple”) and unlabeled ones (just the picture with no name).

The way the models learn was to first use unsupervised learning to learn
representations of all the different samples. This meant that they never received
the labels corresponding to the samples. The idea was that even without the
labels, the models could group similar samples together by representing them
in a different way. Then, the models could use these new representations when
training on a few labeled samples.

An initial hypothesis was that it would be possible to choose samples from
commonly recognized patterns (called ’popular’ attractors) to make the models
perform better. It’s like assuming a child would better identify an apple if shown
the most common apple pictures. However, labeling these kinds of samples did not
increase the classification accuracy.

In conclusion, this study delved deep into the world of computer models
and their learning capabilities. It underscored the importance of ”memory”
in these models, especially when there’s limited data. It also opened doors to
understanding the human brain better and designing models that might one day
replicate our learning processes. The world of computer learning is vast, and
this research has laid a foundation for further research on biologically plausible
computer models in semi-supervised learning."

programs. Therefore, understanding stigma towards individuals with mental illness is crucial for
promoting inclusion and advancing the mental health systems. However, there is limited research
focused on factors that contribute to stigma reduction. The Moldovan government in collaboration
with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation have been implementing a mental health
reform (MENSANA) in Moldova, aimed to establish a community based mental health system. This
study is aimed to examine the differences in stigma levels using the Community Attitudes towards the
Mentally Ill (CAMI) scale across various socio-demographic characteristics. Additionally, the study
explored the association of piloting districts with the mental health reform and the overall score of
CAMI. In a cross-sectional study, the sample comprised 2973 adults. One-way ANOVA and T-test
were used to assess the difference in CAMI scores across socio-demographic variables. Moderation
analysis was conducted using PROCESS version 3.5. Results from the analysis of variances indicated
slightly higher stigma levels among individuals with lower educational attainment (F=10.813, df1=3,
df2=2969, p-value=<0.001). The independent t-test revealed that stigma levels were slightly higher
among males who lacked social contact with individuals with mental illness (t=-4.257, df=2971,
p<0.001; t=-5.322, df=2971, p<0.001). Although social contact was not found to be a moderator of
piloting districts with mental health, a significant main effect was found, demonstrating that stigma
was lower among those who have prior social contact experiences with individuals with mental illness
(B=0.0855, SE=0.0167, t=5.1149, p<0.001). This study demonstrated that prior contact experiences
with the mentally ill is a significant predictor of stigma level. To that end, follow-up research is
needed to concretize the results into a stigma reduction program in Moldova"
The role of microbiota derived peptidoglycan fragments in diseases and therapies,"['Berkel, Kevin van']","['Zoete, Marcel de']",2023-11-30T00:01:01Z,EN,[],Infection and Immunity,"The human gut microbiota, inhabited by diverse microorganisms, including bacteria, plays a pivotal role in maintaining our overall health. In its normal state, the human gut microbiota exhibits stability, resilience, and a mutually beneficial relationship with the host. Furthermore, it plays a crucial role in various  physiological processes, such as metabolism, immune function, and nutrient absorption. Peptidoglycan fragments derived from the human gut microbiota, acting on immune receptors, are important in preserving this symbiotic relationship, but disruptions in this balance can lead to the onset of various diseases. This literature review aims to explore the potential link between peptidoglycan fragments and the development of different diseases. Additionally, it delves into the therapeutic applications of peptidoglycan. It has become evident that disturbances in peptidoglycan sensing, particularly involving NOD-like receptors (NLRs: NOD1 and NOD2) and peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGLYRPs), contribute to intestinal dysbiosis and the emergence of several diseases, including Crohn's disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, and cardiovascular conditions. Notably, these disruptions also impact the development of cancer, especially colorectal cancer (CRC). However, peptidoglycan fragments exhibit a dual role, promoting tumorigenesis while also inhibiting it, for instance, by enhancing the effectiveness of PD-L1 anti-tumor immunotherapy. Consequently, peptidoglycan fragments used as therapeutics to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy hold promise for the future. Furthermore, the development of inhibitors targeting NLRs and PGLYRPs offers potential in slowing the progression of the aforementioned diseases. Patients suffering from conditions like Crohn's disease could potentially benefit from the utilization of probiotics, paraprobiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation. These therapeutic implications, whether utilizing or inhibiting peptidoglycan or its immune receptors, offer promising prospects for the future. However, it is essential to underscore that further research is necessary to carefully weigh the benefits against the risks and ensure a balanced approach to disease management."

domestic workers (FMDWs) in Andalusia, Spain. Paid domestic work in Spain, as well as around the world,
is characterized by precarity and lack of legal recognition. Because of the overrepresentation of female
migrants in this sector, abundant literature has addressed this topic by exploring how intersecting systems
of oppression situate these women in a disempowered position in their host societies. But despite these
constraining structures, FMDWs navigate their everyday lives implementing collective and individual
actions to improve their personal situation. Engaging in labour migration is itself an act of agency that has
ambivalent effects towards their empowerment and wellbeing. Some women are quickly successful in their
projects, while most endure hard working and living conditions in the hope of eventually achieving a better
quality of life. This research uses the capability approach to account for the wellbeing of FMDWs according
to their values and interests, as well as the use of their individual agency for achieving their desired
functionings. The data of this research was collected over a period of three months in Andalusia through
interviews, observation, and one focus group. This research found that migrating and becoming a domestic
worker in Spain has both empowering and disempowering effects on Latin American women. However, it
is still a sector characterized by precarity and abuses. Relational factors and personal resources define the
situation of each FMDW, although the migration status and time spent in the country are determinants on
their (dis)empowerment. Overall, it was found that these women have high levels of agency and awareness
towards their situation. However, how this translates to an increase of their wellbeing and capabilities is
limited by a context of global inequalities and constraining institutions in Spain."

The central theory used in this thesis is Johnson’s blowback theory. I will argue in this thesis that the negative consequences of the US drone strikes are the civilian casualties caused and the meaning given to these civilian casualties by the local actors in Afghanistan. To operationalise the meaning given within the blowback theory, I have combined the blowback theory with framing by Jabri combined with Benford and Snow. To make sense of the secrecy element of the blowback theory, I have engaged with epistemic politics, as presented by Gould and Stel. Presenting this thesis, I have provided new guiding options for operationalising the blowback theory. Often, scholars jump to recognise blowback in new Taliban recruits without first researching the meaning-making processes on the local level as to how the Taliban was able to recruit more members. I argue that the grievances that arise from the civilian casualties caused by the US drone program can be used to mobilise collective action. Nevertheless, this research is based on limited anecdotal research. I have not researched this in depth. Much more research is needed.]"

highlighting the need for resilient flood risk management in Urban areas. Involving public and 
private stakeholders and the community in the formulation of policies and decision-making 
procedures is essential to the governance of water resources. For efficient flood control and 
equitable decision-making, a coordinated and inclusive strategy encompassing the public and 
private sectors, stakeholders, and public participation frameworks is required. Despite having 
a strong flood defense system, the Netherlands needs to be e resilient due to hazards from 
urbanization, climate change, and economic expansion. To improve the resilience of the 
Dutch city of Utrecht which experienced extreme water events in recent years, the 
Municipality of Utrecht has adopted a governance approach for climate adaptation. To 
effectively manage flooding in Utrecht, the Municipality, Waterboard, Safety Regions, and 
other stakeholders work together. It is crucial to employ adaptive methods, accept 
uncertainty, and develop damage-prevention plans in managing flood risk. This thesis aimed 
to evaluate the flood risk management of Utrecht. The study assesses flood-proofing 
strategies and the adaptability of flood management and governance to safeguard urban 
areas from the effects of precipitation and climate change. The research examines the steps 
taken by Utrecht's flood management governance and their efficacy in boosting resilience 
using a literature review, policy analysis, and stakeholder interviews. Three components of 
policy and planning, infrastructure and technology, and community engagement and 
participation were selected to evaluate the flood risk management and governance of Utrecht 
based on different literature. In the thesis's conclusion, suggestions are made for enhancing 
Utrecht's flood management and governance. The importance of ongoing stakeholder 
cooperation, openness, and public involvement is highlighted. The study emphasizes the need 
for a thorough and inclusive approach to improve flood resilience in urban areas and helps to 
comprehend community engagement and collaboration in water management governance."
"The politics of money, growth-dependency and monetary transformation - The case of the Makkie time-bank in Amsterdam-Oost","['Golenvaux, Diane']","['Alakavuklar, Ozan']",2023-10-01T01:01:01Z,EN,['money; monetary transformation; growth-dependency; community currencies; time-banks'],Organising Social Impact,"Global financialization has led the politics of money and debt to be increasingly contested. Debt-based monetary creation, accumulation and artificial scarcity engrain competition, exploitation and growth dependency in capitalist economies. Through the proliferation of complementary currencies, communities show that there are ways to reclaim and reorganize monetary systems to sustain their livelihoods beyond capitalist market relations. This research presents a critical framework to analyze monetary logics in capitalist economies as well as in community currency networks. Community currencies are based on the principle of cooperation, monetary abundance and plurality and hence have the potential to diversify and democratize the economy. Time-banks foster greater social capital, care, solidarity and collaboration within communities. They have a different value system and facilitate economic exchanges that would not take place otherwise. The case of the Makkie, a time-bank from Amsterdam-Oost, is analyzed through the lens of institutional logics: the conflicting relationship to the surrounding political-economic environment, the values, meanings and rules of the network, as well as to socio-economic practices it enables. Since 2012, the expansion of the network and progressive co-optation by the local government has infused the gift-economy network organized around use-value and solidarity with welfare rules and capitalist practices. The difficulty of the Makkie network to sustain itself without the municipality funding, and to stay embedded in the community in spite of scaling-up represent important challenges for community currencies."

Herbivory and Water Level Management on Wetland Vegetation 
Development, The case of Oostvaardersplassen park, The Netherlands.","['Carrasco Oliva, Gabriela']","['Temmink, Ralph']",2023-09-30T00:02:25Z,EN,"['Rewilding, Herbivory, Vegetation development, reed, Novel Ecosystem']",Sustainable Development,"Wetlands play a crucial role in providing ecosystem services that contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, human activities have led to widespread degradation of wetlands over the past three centuries, increasing efforts for wetland restoration.
In some cases, restoring wetlands to their original ecosystem state may no longer be feasible. As a result, new restoration paradigms have emerged as alternative approaches to enhance ecosystem services and resilience, such as rewilding. Active rewilding actions, including the emulation of dry 
periods to create stochastic disturbances, and the introduction of ""ecosystem engineers"" for trophic restoration, are currently employed in Oostvaardersplassen park, The Netherlands. A recent induced 
drawdown, initiated in 2020, aimed to regenerate vegetation by following the natural wetlands cycle. However, this restoration effort faces challenges from red deer (Cervus elaphus) herbivory, which might limit vegetation development.To address this issue, this study investigated the effects of red deer herbivory and artificial water level management on vegetation development during the early stage of ecological succession. The research involved an exclusion experiment in the wetland area of Oostvaardersplassen park. By exploring the co-occurrence of these rewilding measures, the study aimed to fill knowledge gaps regarding the impact of red deer herbivory on wetland vegetation following a drawdown. Particular attention was given to the development of the common reed (Phragmites australis) species, as 
reedbeds serve as vital habitats for numerous species.
On the one hand, the study's findings demonstrated that deer herbivory had adverse effects on reed presence, coverage, and height. On the other hand, in the short-term, herbivory exclusion led to an increase in vegetation coverage. However, other vegetation diversity variables were not significantly affected by herbivory. Additionally, water level fluctuations resulted in different vegetation communities over time, and higher water levels had a negative impact on vegetation development.
This research reveals the negative impact of deer herbivory on reed development and highlights potential limitations to overall vegetation growth when herbivory pressure persists. The insights gained from this study are valuable in shaping wetland restoration and management strategies, ultimately contributing to the preservation and enhancement of wetland ecosystem services. To ensure the progression of this ecosystem towards a boom phase, implementing preventive measures to reduce deer impact will be crucial. By doing so, wetland restoration efforts can effectively steer the development of a diverse and resilient ecosystem that benefits both biodiversity and the fulfillment of wetland-related SDGs."

This study aims to fill the empirical knowledge gap concerning local perspectives and experiences on new cities. Through focusing on affected local populations, the study investigates how the early stages of the project relate to inclusive development, specifically the safeguard ‘Free, Prior, and Informed Consent’, and the ‘right to the city’ concept. Using a qualitative case-study research design, through household interviews and focus group discussions, this study focuses on the local mechanisms of a water management project in the Sepaku village. The results show that the new city evolves in nonlinear and fragmented ways, resulting in a co-occurrence of rural and urban activities that blur the rural-urban divide. Second, in several cases, the proposed land acquisition for the project did not align with the international safeguard ‘Free, Prior, and Informed Consent.’ Third, divergent perspectives were found, often showing the project’s inability to adequately involve local people. Fourth, the divergent aspirations and needs unveiled why some farmers aspire to maintain their current livelihoods while the younger generation wishes to participate in the new city. Altogether, these results reveal the early challenges surrounding inclusive land governance and people’s right to the new city. Finally, several suggestions reveal what can be done better to include local populations and what future research should assess."

High-resolution grain size analysis using photos,"['Bakker, Casper']","['Price, Timothy']",2023-10-26T23:01:25Z,EN,['Grain Size Analysis; photo-optometry; Correction Method; Volume-by-weight; Area-by-size'],Earth Surface and Water,"Grain size is an important factor that influences sediment transport at beaches. Traditional methods of obtaining grain size properties, such as sieving or settling tube, are time-consuming and labour-intensive, which limits the ability to map large sections of a beach in the spatial and temporal domains. This leads to significant simplification of the spatio-temporal variability of the beach sediment, whereby an entire
section of the beach is defined by a single property.
In this study, grain size distributions are analysed using pyDGS. This method involves capturing images of sediment samples, significantly reducing fieldwork while enabling higher-resolution sampling. This study addresses the main challenge when using various grain size analysis methods, where the areal (pyDGS) and volumetric (sieve) measures are not directly comparable. To effectively utilise pyDGS as an alternative to mechanical sieving, we introduce a novel correction method. In contrast to the traditional correction method, which relies on correction exponents obtained through additional sampling methods, our method utilises information extracted from the images. It involves a three-step process for all grain size classes within an image: 1) calculate the total number of grains in the photo frame, 2) estimate the volume of each grain class, and 3) compute the mass of each grain size category by multiplying the number of grains by their volume and density. In this study, the grain shape was estimated and calibration was done with sediment samples that were photographed and sieved. In total, we analyzed 380 sediment photographs, with 43 sediment samples also sieved for direct comparison. The results of our novel correction method were compared to those of the traditional correction method. Our study reveals that the errors associated with D90, D84, D50, and D25 are similar. However, for D16 and D10, our novel method achieved a 4% reduction in RMSE and a 7% reduction in MAE for
D16, and a 24% reduction in RMSE and a 19% reduction in MAE for D10. During the most recent field campaign, we photographed a total of 24 cross-shore rows. This extensive dataset demonstrates the potential of our approach, which would be unfeasible with traditional grain size analysis methods. 
The main contribution of this research is the introduction of a novel correction approach, enabling the conversion of area-based measurements into volume-by-weight measurements. This approach eliminates the need for generalisation and offers a more precise correction method for individual images. Making it particularly valuable for larger beach sections. Despite challenges related to grain shape uncertainties and sediment variability, the new method provides a more effective way of correcting the images for improved accuracy.
While pyDGS does exhibit significant errors that prevent it from providing absolute values, it cannot fully replace mechanical sieving. However, its high spatial resolution capabilities offer a valuable tool for studying the temporal evolution of grain size at beaches. This method provides insights into relative patterns in grain size evolution, enhancing our understanding of beach sediment dynamics and contributing to more effective coastal management strategies."

Halfway through ninth grade, these students have to choose which subjects they will elect for the rest of their secondary education career and which they will drop. However, it is mandatory for all students to continue with all subjects through 9th grade and all subjects are considered in the end-of-year evaluation, creating a motivationally controlling environment. This mixed- methods study, utilizing questionnaires and focus group interviews, examines the motivational profiles and perceived support for basic psychological needs (BPNs) of 9th-grade students who have elected chemistry in their SCC and students who have not.
In line with self-determination theory, the questionnaire results reveal a positive correlation between BPN support and autonomous motivation. Furthermore, students who had not elected chemistry (N=144) experienced significantly more controlled forms of motivation and significantly less support of their BPNs compared to the students (N=132) who had elected chemistry. Focus group interviews with the former group of students (12 participants in total) provided recommendations for supporting their BPNs. They expressed a desire for more autonomy by having control over their learning goals and more variety during the lessons. They also emphasized the need for structured instruction, demonstrations, and personal assistance. Additionally, a positive teacher-student relationship was identified as being crucial for them.
This research highlights the importance of need-supportive teaching, especially in an inherently controlling school situation. Implications are discussed."

Obtaining a high-resolution connectome, where individual neurons and synapses are annotated, has long been a challenge, with most complete connectomes containing just a few hundred neurons and
synapses. However, a groundbreaking achievement has been the recent elucidation of the connectome of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which includes thousands of neurons and millions of annotated synapses. These comprehensive connectomes are invaluable as they enable the comparison of neural connections between different brains, even across species, shedding light on how changes in brain connectivity can impact brain function and behaviour. This review explores the path that led to the creation of the most extensive and detailed connectome to date. It also provides an overview of the strategies for approaching comparative connectomics. The development of these extensive connectomes has been driven by advances in electron microscopy systems and computational tools, which have streamlined the automatic annotation of neurons and synapses. While traditional methods for comparing connectomes have primarily relied on morphological neuron comparisons, there is a growing demand for approaches rooted in the connectivity of neurons. Graph matching emerges as a pivotal technique to determine neuron correspondences across different brains, yet challenges persist in finding an accurate and scalable solution, particularly for large brains."

Tijdens zijn presidentschap voerde Nasser een feministisch beleid dat door theoristen bestempeld is als het ‘staatsfeminisme.’ Hoewel dit beleid erin slaagde grote mijlpalen te behalen wat betreft de politieke rechten en arbeidsmogelijkheden van vrouwen, betekende de autoritaire manier waarop het werd doorgevoerd dat veranderingen niet doordrongen tot alle lagen van de samenleving en dat onafhankelijke feministische organisatie verboden was. Daarnaast had Nassers ideologische tegenpool in de vorm van het Moslimbroederschap een volledig andere kijk op de maatschappelijke rol van vrouwen. Het Broederschap beargumenteerde dat gescheiden genderrollen onderdeel waren van een holistisch islamitisch systeem, waarin de man een publieke en de vrouw een domestieke functie diende te vervullen. Via primair bronnenonderzoek zullen hun standpunten geanalyseerd worden, waarna deze geplaatst worden in een breder theoretisch kader. Hierbij zal gevonden worden dat zowel het standpunt van Nasser als dat van het Moslimbroederschap in grote mate bepaald wordt door utilitaire in plaats van absolute ideologische overwegingen; beide partijen worden voornamelijk gemotiveerd door de pragmatische benodigdheden van hun positie binnen het Egyptische politieke systeem. Hiermee probeert dit onderzoek aansluiting te vinden met een breder wetenschappelijk kader dat probeert de perceptie van een absolute dichotomie tussen islamitische en seculiere partijen te nuanceren, onder andere op het gebied van vrouwenrechten en feminisme."

Roughly 100% of the total DIC increase over this period can be related to the increase in Cant concentration. In the depth range where the products of organic matter remineralization are high on top of the Cant increase, the decreased TA/DIC ratio results in an increased sensitivity for the pCO2, pH and H+ ions.

Onderzoek naar gezondheidssystemen in andere landen laat echter zien dat deze systemen nog niet optimaal gebruiksvriendelijk zijn. Daarom is het belangrijk om te evalueren hoe gebruiksvriendelijk de systemen in Nederland zijn. Omdat niet elke praktijkmedewerker een systeem hetzelfde beoordeelt, differentieer ik in functies. Dat betekent dat ik in dit onderzoek kijk hoe de systemen worden geëvalueerd op gebruiksvriendelijkheid, en of deze score afhankelijk is van de functie die de praktijkmedewerker bekleedt. ASP en Scipio zijn geanalyseerd aan de hand van een enquête. Daaruit bleek op het eerste gezicht dat Scipio over het algemeen slechter werd beoordeeld dan ASP. Maar, dit effect werd genuanceerd: het hangt namelijk af van aan wie je het vraagt. Huisartsen vinden Scipio inderdaad significant slechter dan ASP. Huisartsassistenten zijn daarentegen minder kritisch: zij beoordelen de twee systemen hetzelfde. Assistenten zijn dus minder kritisch, of de asisstentmodule van Scipio is evengoed als die van ASP.
Hierdoor weten de ontwikkelaars op welke aspecten zij ASP en Scipio moeten verbeteren. Sanday is onderzocht aan de hand van een hardopwerktaak. De momenten waarop de participanten afweken van de ideale taakuitvoering zijn geanalyseerd aan de hand van een classificatie van ernst.

oorspronkelijk uitgegeven door het Boston Women’s Health Book Collective als cursussyllabus,
heeft een grote impact gehad op de agency van vrouwen wereldwijd. De opgetekende ervaringen
van vrouwen en de specifiek voor hen bestemde (medische) informatie in OBOS stelden vrouwen
in staat om op een nieuwe manier invulling te geven aan hun vrouw-zijn en dit bespreekbaar te
maken met andere vrouwen, waartoe het werk expliciet uitnodigt.

Het grote aantal vertalingen van OBOS geeft inzicht in de regionale context van
feministische bewegingen in de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw. De uitdaging om OBOS te
vertalen was vaak groot: de onderwerpen die besproken worden waren vaak niet alleen sociaal-
maatschappelijk gevoelig of zelfs taboe, ook de juridische en culturele context van deze
onderwerpen verschilde per land aanzienlijk. Daarnaast brengt de expliciet feministische identiteit
van OBOS ook uitdagingen met zich mee: hoe kan hieraan recht worden gedaan en tegelijkertijd
de culturele identiteit van de vertaling worden gerespecteerd?

In dit onderzoek wordt gekeken naar de Nederlandse vertaling van OBOS, getiteld Je
lichaam, je leven (1975), vertaald door Heleen Pott en Liesbeth van der Sluys en bewerkt door Anja
Meulenbelt. Hoewel de vertaling een succes was, te zien aan de herdruk die nog geen jaar later
plaatsvond, zijn er nauwelijks Nederlandstalige publicaties over Je lichaam, je leven. In een tijd waarin
het zelfbeschikkingsrecht van vrouwen nog steeds geen vaststaande zekerheid is, refererend naar
de herroeping van het recht op abortus in de Verenigde Staten in 2022, loont het juist om te kijken
naar een werk als Je lichaam, je leven. Dit onderzoek richt zich specifiek op het hoofdstuk waarin
abortus besproken wordt, een onderwerp dat direct verband houdt met het zelfbeschikkingsrecht
van vrouwen.

Het doel van dit onderzoek is het in kaart brengen van de vertaalkeuzes die gemaakt zijn
in Je lichaam je leven aan de hand van een theoretisch kader over vrouwengezondheidsteksten en hun
vertaling en tekstfunctie, ingebed in feministische vertaaltheorie. Om te onderzoeken welk effect
de vertaalstrategieën van de vertalers hebben op de lezer, maken we gebruik van de notie
perlocutionairy translation, die Annie Brisset in 1990 introduceerde. Een perlocutionaire vertaling,
volgens Brisset, heeft een tot actie aanzettend effect op de lezer van een tekst. Aan de hand van

In the Mekong Delta, upstream sediment trapping by dams and local sand mining practises have already proven to rapidly change the deltas morphology in the form of river bed deepening and coastal retreat, resulting in land loss and increased salinisation in the delta. Further processes that contribute to these problems in the delta are delta-wide subsidence due to groundwater extraction and global sea level rise (SLR). This study aims to provide an overview on the projected changes in sand transport mechanisms due to SLR, subsidence, river bed lowering and discharge alteration by dams. For this, a delta-wide DELFT3D-FM hydro- and morphological model is used to illustrate the current complex sand dynamics inside the delta. This study shows the influence of human impact on the deltas internal sand dynamics by separately testing the systems response to SLR sea level, subsidence, river bed lowering and an altered discharge. In the end, projected changes on sand dynamics for 2040 were simulated. The results confirm the different distinct hydrodynamic regimes present in the delta. In the fluvial dominated tract seaward sand transport is highly variable and rates are 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than in the estuaries downstream. Here, a reduced wet season discharge results in lower net annual sand transport volumes. Deepening the river bed lowers water levels relative to the banks, effectively capturing the peak flow, reducing the deltas buffering capacity. This ultimately increases the seasonality of the sand transport in this region. In the fluvial-tidal regime, seaward sand export increases by the amplified tidal velocity amplitude as a result of SLR, subsidence and river bed deepening. In the tide-dominated regime, seaward sand export rates decrease as increased water depth in the wide estuaries results in a large increase in the estuaries cross-sectional area, reducing the tidal flow velocity amplitude. Sand influx from the Mekong is expected to decrease as wet season discharge is reduced. Furthermore, increased erosion rates can be expected near My Thuan, contributing to the already present river-bank instability. Lastly, the low transport rates in the smaller estuaries show that sand replenishment is slow, therefore exploitation in these regions will have long-term consequences for the sand availability here. The results of this study can be used to identify locations where morphological changes can be expected in other deltas worldwide."

Ook blijkt psychologische inflexibiliteit sterker samen te hangen met internaliserende psychopathologie (r=.71) dan met externaliserende psychopathologie (r=.38). Het modererend effect van leeftijd is alleen gevonden bij de samenhang met psychologische inflexibiliteit en externaliserende psychopathologie. Daarbij is een sterker effect gevonden voor jongeren met een lagere leeftijd dan bij jongeren met een hogere leeftijd. Concluderend suggereert dit onderzoek dat er een sterke samenhang is tussen psychologische inflexibiliteit en internaliserende psychopathologie, ongeacht de leeftijd van jongeren. Dit onderzoek is relevant voor de klinische praktijk, omdat de resultaten van dit onderzoek aanknopingspunten bieden voor verder effectonderzoek. 
	Psychopathology has a negative impact on the lives of youth. Psychological inflexibility is seen as a transdiagnostic factor for psychopathology. The aim of this study was to gather information about the relationship between psychological inflexibility and (internalizing and externalizing) psychopathology in youth and the effect of age on this correlation. In total, 601 Dutch people aged 15 to 25 years completed a questionnaire about psychological inflexibility and psychopathology. Correlation and moderation analyzes were performed. The results show that there was a correlation between psychological inflexibility and psychopathology (r=.68). Psychological inflexibility also appears to be more strongly correlated with internalizing psychopathology (r=. 71) than with externalizing psychopathology (r=.38). The moderating effect of age was only found in the correlation with psychological inflexibility and externalizing psychopathology. A stronger effect was found for young people with a lower age than for young people with a higher age. In conclusion, this study suggests that there is a strong association between psychological inflexibility and internalizing psychopathology, regardless of age. This study is relevant for clinical practice, because the results of this study provide starting points for further effect research."

Toch bleef haar werk tot nog toe onderbelicht in de architectuurgeschiedenis. Dit oeuvre-onderzoek richt zich specifiek op haar werk. Aan de hand van haar carrière wordt inzichtelijk gemaakt hoe praktisch ze opdrachten aanvloog en hoe ze op ideeën kwam. Ook wordt duidelijk dat Verschuuren de rol van interieurarchitect zeer belangrijk vond, hoewel ze zelf erg bescheiden was. Vervolgens wordt uitgebreid ingegaan op de ontwerpen van drie verschillende gebouwtypen: een kantoor, een luchthaven en een theater. 
De kantoorontwerpen van Nel Verschuuren werden gezien als vernieuwend en zijn toonaangevend in de Nederlandse interieurarchitectuur. Ook haar ontwerp voor Schiphol, voortbouwend op het ontwerp van Kho Liang Ie (1927-1975), werd destijds als voorbeeld gezien. Haar theaterontwerp is minder bekend, maar bijzonder is dat ze hier elk meubelstuk zelf heeft ontworpen. Door kenmerkende ontwerpelementen per gebouwtype te benoemen, ontstaat een beeld van haar signatuur. De conclusie die daaruit volgt: de interieurarchitectuur van Nel Verschuuren mag niet in de vergetelheid raken."

toddlers (36 months old) and mothers’ parenting behavior. Further, the effect of parenting
stress to explain this correlation was examined. Methods: 244 mother-child dyads were
recruited from multiple midwifery practices as a part of the YOUth cohort study. Both moms
and toddlers took part in four parent-child interaction tasks, in which parenting behavior was
measured through supportive presence and structure and limit setting. Mothers also filled out
online questionnaires about their child's self-regulation skills and the amount of parenting
stress they experienced as mothers. Results showed that the relationship between the self-regulation
skills of toddlers and supportive presence was fully mediated by parenting stress.
A significant negative correlation (p < .001) between toddler self-regulation skills and the
amount of parenting stress mothers experienced. No significant correlation was found
between toddler self-regulation skills and structure and limit setting. Parenting stress does not
seem to explain the relationship between toddler self-regulation skills and structure and limit
setting. Conclusion: Findings from this study can be valuable insights to stimulate
interventions to reduce parenting stress and improve adequate parenting behavior. Reducing
parenting stress might be achieved through knowledge improvement, learning coping skills
and through parents’ social networks, offering them more support during parenting."

Method: The participants were 230 early adolescents (Mage = 12.54, SD = .67), enrolled in Dutch schools. The cross-sectional data was collected through the online questionnaire on social competence by Valkenburg & Peter (2008), the Sibling Relationship Questionnaire-Short version (SRQ-S) and the Network of Relationships Inventory (NRI). Results: A T-test for independent samples shows that early adolescents with a harmonious sibling relationship scored significantly higher on social competence than early adolescents with a conflictual sibling relationship. However, regression analysis using PROCESS shows that the association between sibling relationship types and social competence is not significant. Parental support has a significant association with social competence, which means that early adolescents with more parental support scored higher on social competence. Parental support is not a significant moderator for the association between sibling relationship quality and social competence. Conclusion: The results show that it is important to take into account multiple subsystems in the (nuclear) family in research of social competence of early adolescents. Considering these results, interventions can be developed and used to prevent or minimize deficits in, or to promote social competence. In these interventions, the focus should not be on just one subsystem within the family, but other systems and the family as a whole should be highlighted."

Method. The data is collected through the use of questionnaires. The quality of the sibling relationship in terms of warmth and conflict was measured by the Sibling Relationship Questionnaire. Adolescent internalizing problems were measured by the Youth Self Report. The data is collected by questioning 560 adolescents between the age of 11 and 19. Results. A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted. The results shows that more warmth in the sibling reltionships is associated with less internalising problems. In addition firstborns show more conflict in the siblings relationships than did later borns. The effect of the quality of the sibling reationship on reporting internalising problems is not moderated by birth order. Conclusion. Warmth in the sibling relationship is an inportant element in reducing / preventing of internalising problems by adolescences.

And the first place goes to…: A qualitative study on the impact of the Healthy City Index on theplanning of healthy cities,"['Kroon, Ellen']","['Monstadt, Jochen']",2023-11-16T08:34:42Z,EN,['Healthy Cities; Healthy City Index; case study; urban planning; city rankings and indexes'],Spatial Planning,"There is a remarkable growth in the appearance of city rankings and indexes. City rankings and indexes are frequently used to evaluate cities’ performance in achieving sustainability and health. However, there is a dominant concern in urban studies that the impact of city rankings and indexes is under-examined. Consequently, this study explores the impact of city rankings and indexes on the planning of healthy cities. The main research question guiding this study is: “How do city rankings and indexes impact the planning of healthy cities?”. To answer the research question, qualitative research methods were used. Specifically, a case study approach involving semi-structured interviews. The case used was the Healthy City Index developed by the consulting and engineering firm Arcadis. In total, 24 experts were interviewed. The experts included experts employed in municipalities included in the Healthy City Index, an expert from Arcadis, the initiator of the index, and one expert with profound knowledge on the topic of healthy cities. 
The study concludes that a city ranking or index, specifically the Healthy City Index, has limited impact on the planning of healthy cities. The limited impact is derived from various findings. Firstly, the Healthy City Index has limited usefulness in addressing the main challenges of planning healthy cities. Secondly, the increased awareness of the topic, due to the Healthy City Index, is short-lived and diminishes over time. Thirdly, municipalities do not actively focus on increasing performance on the Healthy City Index to plan a healthy city. Fourthly, considering the limitations, the suitableness of using the Healthy City Index for the planning of healthy cities by municipalities is limited. Lastly, the Healthy City Index is not actively used as a strategic steering tool, limiting its impact. The main impact of the Healthy City Index currently lies in highlighting the topic’s urgency, providing evidence for reaffirming existing problems and formulating tasks, and stimulating inter-municipality learning and collaboration. However, this impact is significantly based on speculations and influenced by circumstantial factors within municipalities. Consequently, in its current state, the Healthy City Index is more a marketing tool for Arcadis than it has profound impact on the planning of healthy cities by municipalities.
The main research limitations of this research are the case-specificness, the broad selection criteria for municipal experts, the lack of general municipal perspectives on city rankings and indexes, the broad research scope, and the time constraints during the expert interviews. Consequently, this study opens up various opportunities for future research."
"Understanding the challenges for citizens in the municipal heat transition: A case study of the city of Itzehoe, Germany","['Rehder, Jana']","['Vela Almeida, Diana']",2023-11-17T00:01:16Z,EN,['Energy Transition; Heat Transition; Energy Justice; Energy Citizenship'],Sustainable Development,"In light of the immense challenges of the energy crisis that Germany and many other European countries are currently facing, it becomes evident that a far-reaching energy transition is needed. While a shift away from fossil fuels can be seen in the German electricity sector, the heating sector remains in a fossil lock-in, as only 17.4 % of the domestic and industrial heat used in Germany was produced by using renewable energies (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz, n.d.).  
The transformation of the heating sector requires using and intelligently combining locally available energy potentials while considering existing infrastructure. Therefore, municipalities play a central role in the transition process.  But most importantly the transition of the heating system includes many measures that take place within people’s living spaces, which puts domestic energy users at the core of the transition process, necessitating a shift from passive consumerism to increased involvement. 

Therefore, the objective of this research was to understand the challenges for citizens’ involvement in the heat transition. To do so a case study was conducted in the city of Itzehoe, Germany based on survey research, interviews with local key actors, and a policy analysis. 
The results indicate that the HT in Itzehoe is still at an early stage being a system widely dominated by fossil fuels, but it also suggests that the citizens of Itzehoe are aware of the importance of the energy transition and are motivated to contribute to a more sustainable energy system. However, it also shows that it is important to not overemphasize the responsibility of individuals, as the data suggest that a wide range of structural challenges hamper citizens’ involvement. 

An overarching and reoccurring theme is the necessity to develop a clear vision for the transition process and the necessity to improve the information flow from the national government, the municipality, the utility provider, and actors from the housing sector to the citizens to make involvement possible. This is especially relevant for the plans for heating networks, as these significantly influence homeowners’ decision-making, Further, it can be seen that the current political framework does not take the different financial situations of homeowners into account and fails to protect tenants from over-proportional allocation of costs."

Regulating metabolic flux, especially in stress conditions, is essential to cell survival. An increasing number of studies suggest that the spatial organization of metabolic enzymes within the cell plays a critical role in regulating metabolic flux. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it is speculated that enzyme sequestration is a common mechanism of downregulating product synthesis rates in starvation conditions. Particularly, sequestration by filament formation is reported as a prevalent phenomenon. In this study, we investigate filament formation of CTP synthase in situ, using a cryo-CLEM tomography approach. We identify three individual instances of filament bundles and characterize them through filament averaging. To enable efficient implementation of rapid GPU-based template matching for locating CTP synthase in non-filamentous form, we develop a subvolume-based template matching approach. Altogether, we present a methodology that can be adapted for mapping out the spatial organization of metabolic pathways, to improve our understanding of how cells control their metabolism."

The close relation to the terrestrial ecosystems causes coastal lagoons to be vulnerable to impacts that are caused by human activities on land. 

The state of the coastal lagoons and the impact of human activities, is unknown for the Wider Caribbean Region. This study analyzes nitrate (N), phosphate (P), heavy metals, sedimentation rate and diatoms to reconstruct the recent development of four coastal lagoons in the Caribbean. Diatoms are used as proxy as they quickly respond to changes in water quality. Using short sediment cores, for four lagoons human impact is assessed. The lagoons have varying degrees of impact, from high (Fresh 
Pond, Sint Maarten), to medium (Spanish Lagoon, Aruba; Santa Martha, Curacao) to low impact (Saliña Bartol, Bonaire). Surface sediment samples were collected from eleven additional sites to provide a spatial context.

Expected was that 1) levels of N, P, and heavy metals increase with increased human impact, that 2) biodiversity increases with decreasing human impact, and that 3) diatoms are a valuable and useful proxy for reconstructing water quality and environmental conditions. Results of heavy metals and N and P impact show that indeed human impact is most strongly pronounced in the site that was selected as high impact site (Fresh Pond, Sint Maarten). The medium and low impact sites do not show clear signs of human impact. Furthermore, results show that there 
is no correlation between diatom diversity and P, Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), and Nickel (Ni) concentrations. Although the Zinc (Zn) concentrations seem negatively correlated with diatom diversity, this is mainly caused by the low diversity of diatoms in the ponds on Sint Maarten. Observed diatom diversity is influenced by dissolution of diatom valves. Poor diatom preservation can bias results. As alkalinity, salinity and morphology of diatoms can strongly influence preservation, these factors are analyzed. Data suggests that species that are morphologically robust are less susceptible to dissolution in hyper saline conditions. A comparison of diatom assemblage between modern and sediment surface samples show that differences in observed diatom assemblage are substantial."

emerging field of study, primarily focusing on challenges faced and strategies applied during the
initiation phase of permaculture enterprises. This research seeks to bridge a critical gap in the
existing literature by exploring the factors that shape the strategies employed by long-term
successful permaculture practitioners in southern Australia. Through an explorative case study,
this research, while partly affirming prevailing literature on permaculture practitioners' challenges,
strategies, and the factors that mold these strategies, uncovers unique revelations that shed new
light on permaculture practices.
The study uncovers the paramount importance of individual-level factors, notably motivation,
intricately intertwined with practitioners’ personal values, diverse knowledge, creativity, and
adaptability and success perception, while also highlighting the substantial influence of sociallevel factors, such as shared values, communal interests, and the presence of a supportive
community that facilitates their journey. It has become evident that, while posing varied
challenges, institutional level factors showed less relevant for the strategic decision-making of the
permaculture practitioners.
While focused on the context of southern-Australia, this research has created important insights
into the potential of permaculture practitioners, by analyzing examples of long-term success. The
research also provides a stepping-stone into the relatively underexplored domain of long-term
success in permaculture enterprises, offering promising prospects for future research. Further
investigations may extend our understanding and contribute to the advancement of sustainable
transformations within the agricultural sector."

Such implausible policy positions would hitherto have been as disqualifying in the eyes of electorates that were thought to take political decisions based on good sense.  So, did the British electorate simply abandon that good sense in 2016, or did it not exist in the first place? How has the influence of right-wing populism become so pronounced in Britain over the last decade? This thesis will use three international case studies – the Falklands War, the attacks on 9/11 and the 2007-2008 financial crisis – to try to answer these questions."

In particular, little is understood about the impacts of offshore wind farms on marine resource dwellers in the South of Italy. By taking the first offshore wind farm of the Mediterranean in the Gulf of Taranto as a starting point of analysis, this work aims to unpack the emotional responses and risk perceptions of fishermen under socio-environmental change and uncertain circumstances in the context of Taranto. Specifically, I argue that, in the context of Taranto, fishermen rely on the function of the sea, considering it as an identity marker that drove them to develop emotional involvement, specific sea-oriented expertise, and self-motivation to cope with change and uncertainty. Therefore, drawing attention to the sea is paramount to grasping how emotions, change processes, risk exposure, and resilience are interpreted, experienced, and produced. Based on three months of ethnographic fieldwork, this study draws on participant observation, small talks, spontaneous conversations, and semi-structured interviews with recreational, commercial, and professional fishermen. Among my interlocutors, disinterest, anger, and optimism/lack of optimism, emerged as affective reactions concerning the wind farm and further transformations within the broader change scenario. Furthermore, by examining the mutual interplay between emotions, change-related risk perceptions, and imaginations of the future, I demonstrate how ‘diversification’ and ‘social identity’ (Johnson et al. 2014) can be indicators of sociocultural resilience to cope with the perceived risks in the fishing-based community."
The Vjosa Wild River National Park as a Legal Innovation: Creating Transformative Change in Albanian River Governance,"['Störbrock, Rebecca']","['Acevedo Guerrero, Tatiana']",2023-10-01T00:00:57Z,EN,['Vjosa River; Transition Theoory; Reparative Innovation; Wild River National Park'],Sustainable Development,"The Vjosa River in Albania is considered the last European wild river and is a riverine ecosystem of European importance due to its diverse flora and fauna. However, the increasing demand for energy and economic development in Albania has exerted political pressure to install hydropower plants also in the Vjosa River Basin. A coalition of local and international environmental NGOs successfully stopped several hydropower projects on the Vjosa River and has advocated for the establishment of a Vjosa National Park to ensure the integrity of the riverine ecosystem. Against all opposition, in March 2023, the first Wild River National Park was declared and led to the establishment of a new legal category of Protected Areas. This legal innovation is a milestone for global nature conservation and comes with implications for Albanian river management more broadly. Therefore, this research examines which lessons can be drawn from the case study of the Vjosa River about a transition in Albanian river governance by employing an exploratory case study design. Theoretically, this question can be examined by applying transition theory and the novel concept of reparative innovations. Reparative innovations aim at addressing wrongdoings through the process of reparation and facilitate reconciliation by considering historical contexts. The Albanian historical context is characterized by its Communist past, which comes with challenges for the ongoing transition to democracy and EU accession. 
Despite the successful National Park campaign, the proper enforcement of the Wild River National Park is considered a management challenge for the Albanian government due to weak compliance with national and international environmental standards. Therefore, a right of nature approach provides an alternative in cases where environmental law cannot ensure environmental protection. Legal personhood for rivers stipulates rights and duties for a river that can be enforced in court and has been applied to rivers around the world. Such an approach has been shown to address historical inequalities in post-colonial contexts, however, this practice has not been explored in a post-Soviet context yet. For this purpose, this research showcases how the declaration of the Vjosa Wild River National Park created favorable conditions for the conferral of legal personhood on the Vjosa River. Stakeholder analysis and semi-structured interviews were used to identify stakeholders´ perceptions of the discourse on the Vjosa River and to identify new visions advocated by environmental NGOs, which challenge the current Western growth-oriented regime of Albanian river management. A transition in Albanian river management is becoming more evident and has been accelerated by legal innovations emerging from niches and are supported by landscape actors. This research contributes to the academic debate on transition theory by investigating the role of legal innovations in a transition."
Realizing Interoperability within the Dutch Military Healthcare System,"['Gijsen, Karlijn']","['Roelfsema, Hein']",2023-10-02T00:00:44Z,EN,['Interoperability; Healthcare; Military'],Science and Business Management,"The healthcare sector has tremendous potential to increase efficiency and treatment accuracy through technology, resulting in cost reduction which in turn, increases healthcare accessibility. This is particularly critical for military healthcare, as military personnel lack the freedom to choose their healthcare providers. Additionally, the health of our military directly impacts the military position of the Netherlands. The interoperability of medical patient data facilitates efficient care delivery, contributing to cost-effective and improved healthcare outcomes. Therefore, this research aims to systematically identify and analyze the key barriers preventing the Military Healthcare sector from reaching a desired state in terms of the efficient exchange of medical patient data.
	The conceptual framework utilized in this research combines the gap analysis model and the European Interoperability Framework (EIF). The conceptual framework divides the research into five steps using the gap analysis model in which the EIF provides a segmented overview of the barriers. The five steps of the gap analysis are 1) assessing the current state, 2) defining the desired future state, 3) identifying the gaps and 4) barriers, and 5) providing recommendations to bridge the identified gaps and reach the desired state. In step four, the barriers are segmented according to the EIF in legal, semantic, organizational, and technical layers. A qualitative research design was employed to execute the steps of the gap analysis. Semi-structured interviews and literary research were conducted with a study population consisting of 10 relevant stakeholders involved in handling medical patient data within the Defense Organization. In addition, a semi-structured interview was held with an interoperability expert to provide recommendations. Sampling was done through snowball and purposive sampling. Data collection involved recording and transcribing interviews. The data analysis process utilized thematic coding to identify key themes and barriers.
	The results showed that an interoperable Military Healthcare system is desired, either by allowing hospitals and other practicians to seamlessly interact or by providing patients with wearables. However, this research showed that the Military Healthcare sector is still far from achieving an interoperable system. The bottlenecks primarily lie in the exchange of information with operational healthcare, between first- and second-line healthcare, and between the CMH and civil hospitals. Barriers to achieving interoperability were primarily identified in the technical layer and organizational layers. In addition, some barriers in the legal and semantic layers are indicated. However, this study points out that the barriers in the technical layer can be easily overcome with the current technological innovations and legal barriers can be overcome by the new WEGIZ law. To overcome the barriers, this study indicates further deepening of the organizational barriers by interviewing more stakeholders and involving DGO leadership and the Minister of Defense. In conclusion, the pursuit of interoperability in the healthcare sector holds immense potential. By addressing the identified barriers and fostering collaboration among stakeholders, the path can be paved for a future where seamless data exchange and interoperability become the norm. Ultimately, leading to better healthcare outcomes not only for the Dutch Defense Organization but for all."

For successful implementation, steward-ownership is researched as a potential solution. A grounded theory research was conducted to analyze the link between stakeholder theory and steward-ownership, the strategy behind this, and the differences among starters and switchers. Therefore, the following research question was answered: How do organizations adopting steward-ownership create stakeholder value? And how does this differ between starters and switchers?. Qualitative data from twelve conducted in-depth interviews with stewards of steward-owned organizations were analyzed that provided insights into the strategy in these organizations to create stakeholder value and what the role of steward-ownership was. The findings of this analysis showed that steward-ownership can be seen as a viable structure to implement stakeholder theory, because it is a credible approach that allows more time for stakeholder engagement, balancing stakeholder interests and building a community. Whereas a difference is found in long-term perspective of switchers and the uninterest of financial stakeholders of starters, steward-owned organizations adopt a broader range of stakeholder groups and values."

Firstly, many wonder about its relevance and true motivations as it is not an international organization. As explained in Chapter 3, the FATF is seen as a tool of the G7 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to implement a neo-liberal agenda. Secondly, the growing interest of different economies in moving away from the US dollar as the leading international trade currency can weaken, among others, the enforceability capacity of the FATF, which relies on the response of the international financial system to US regulations. Therefore, the sustainability of the FATF depends on its perceived legitimacy. Consequently, this paper discusses legitimacy as an essential element of the FATF, explains how the FATF and its legitimacy are embedded in the coloniality matrix of power (CMP) from a Latin American perspective, and suggests other options for how the FATF could strengthen its legitimacy."

A deeper understanding of the hematopoietic process can have promising clinical implications for the development of immune therapies where the composition of the immune system needs to be altered. Numerous lineage tracing techniques which introduce genetic modifications have been employed in model systems. Approaches in humans usually require the detection of somatic mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA at single-cell level. Here, we perform retrospective lineage tracing by detecting somatic mitochondrial mutations in single-cell sequencing data, and use them as natural genetic barcode to link genetic regulators of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to cell fate in PBMCs. We employ previously published scATAC-seq data from two replicates of CD34+ HSPCs and two replicates of PBMCs from the same donor with a three months time interval, to identify mitochondrial variants. Lineages biased clones were quantified with a chi-squared test, and differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways were inferred. In contrast with previously published results, we observed clones with a significant bias towards the lymphoid, myeloid, and HSC self-renewal lineage. However, regulatory networks of these clones showed minimal overlap between the replicates, indicating uncertainty in the results.

While translation processes in other areas of translation, ranging from news translation, to audiovisual translation, to computer game translation, have drawn increasing attention from researchers in translation studies, the processes followed in board game translation have hardly been researched. The data for the study was gathered by online and in-person interviews containing questions regarding the general translation process, revision and implementation. The data were analyzed using content and thematic analysis. The findings highlight that, while some parts of the processes are similar among all participants, the size of the publisher and their financial position are factors that strongly influence the form the process takes."

Listening to Albanian Youth Activists: The Potential of Activism in Fostering Sociopolitical Efficacy and Generating Hope,"['Najmeddin, Roshn']","['Szytniewski, Bianca']",2023-10-17T01:01:36Z,EN,"['youth activism, youth engagement, sociopolitical efficacy, critical consciousness, non- institutionalized activism, Albania, Tirana']",International Development Studies,"This study explores the engagement of Albanian youth in sociopolitical activism within a post- communist context. Using narrative inquiry, youth activists were interviewed to understand the factors shaping their activism and its relationship with sociopolitical efficacy. The findings counter prevailing narratives of youth apathy, highlighting their capacity for change within constrained circumstances. Participants display proactive agency and sophisticated critical reflection, attributing disengagement to systemic and historical factors rather than indifference. Borrowing a framework inspired by critical consciousness, this paper explores the potential of youth-led bottom-up activism in cultivating the skills, civic knowledge, and agency necessary for meaningful sociopolitical engagement in an unresponsive and distrusted political landscape. Historical mistrust emerges as a significant barrier, rooted in Albania's past. Motivations for engagement in activism span from strong emotions to being inspiration by peers, underlining the multifaceted nature of commitment. The study underscores youth-led activism's potency in cultivating critical awareness, amplifying sociopolitical efficacy and collective agency, and infusing a much-needed sense of hope. Addressing gaps in the literature, this research provides unique and rich insights into youth motivations and the impacts of their activism on themselves. It emphasizes the importance of listening to youth voices and considering contextual nuances in the process of understanding and researching youth (dis)engagement. Furthermore, it suggests the potential of integrating non-institutionalized youth activism into development initiatives, emphasizing youth’s role and capacity as agents of change. In essence, this paper highlights the significance of integrating youth activism and civic education into the field of international development studies. Engaging established networks and actors already cultivating youth-led activism enriches our comprehension and advancement of the transformative power wielded by young people, ultimately promoting inclusive and contextually sensitive sociopolitical change."
Tourism in the circular city – a study case of the museum circularity in Amsterdam,"['Arni Dewi Boronnia, Arni']","['Frantzeskaki, Niki']",2023-10-17T01:01:25Z,EN,"['Circular city; tourism circularity, museums; museum circularity; Amsterdam']",Spatial Planning,"In the face of urban population growth and the heightened demand for tourism, urban areas confront multifaceted challenges beyond their foundational needs. The linear economic paradigm that supports the tourism industry, which dramatically worsens the environment, makes these problems worse. As a result, improving the tourism industry is essential to the viability of moving toward a circular economy. This study explores the possibilities of a continuous circular economy approach that has been incorporated into the city's policy framework since 2015 in order to address the ongoing over-tourism problem in Amsterdam. The study explores the impact of museums on Amsterdam's transition into a circular city, focusing on their crucial role in the tourism industry.  Through a methodological compound of 7 semi-structured interviews and an analysis of 9 documents, data triangulation is ensured. The research is structured across three levels of circular economy transition: micro, meso, and macro levels. The adaptive responses of museums to Amsterdam's circular city strategy are examined at the micro level. Findings show that museums are moving toward sustainability and circular practices, driven by factors like energy efficiency and architectural constraints. A collaborative multi-stakeholder paradigm encompassing museums, suppliers, and governmental bodies is revealed by the second study question, which looks into the governance mechanisms of circularity inside museums. Within cultural institutions, this collaborative structure encourages extensive and environmentally responsible circular processes. Furthermore, the challenges and enablers for implementing circularity within museums functioning within the tourism sector are also being examined in this research. Challenges include limited financial resources, regulatory limitations, and awareness inadequacies. However, the inherent value attached to museums and the growing public demand for sustainability serve as powerful drivers for change. By highlighting museums' ability to be agents of sustainable change within the complex web of urban tourism and the circular city, this study emphasizes the necessity of preserving cultural legacy while reducing ecological effects."

Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) practices and their livelihood outcomes in Andhra Pradesh, India. 
Andhra Pradesh is characterised by any aspects of the agrarian crisis and as a response to these 
problems adopted the agroecological practice of ZBNF. I applied the sustainable livelihood framework 
in combination with intersectionality during this research. In addition, I investigated several steps of 
the research on different scales of analysis to unravel otherwise hidden (power) dynamics.
The methods used consisted of semi-structured interviews with ZBNF farmers and experts. 
Additionally, participatory rural appraisal methods have been used during women’s self-help groups. 
At last, participant observation was used to create a more complete image of ZBNF in Andhra 
Pradesh. The research was executed in the Tenali and Madakasira regions of Andhra Pradesh, which 
have distinct agroclimatic and socioeconomic characteristics. 
The results showed that on a household level, livelihood capitals consisting of indigenous 
cows, social capital and land ownership/tenancy affected the adoption of ZBNF practices nuancedly. 
Improving health, cutting cultivation costs and improving soil health were the primary motivations for 
adopting ZBNF practices. Zooming in showed that women had different livelihood capitals compared 
to the household level. Women’s self-help groups appeared to increase knowledge of ZBNF practices, 
providing financial and physical capital. However, no evidence was found that these individual 
livelihood capitals consistently translated into adopting ZBNF. The double time burden of women
(especially from the low economic class) might hinder translating individual livelihood capitals into
ZBNF adoption. Additionally, intra-household work division and decision-making did not change after 
adopting ZBNF practices. At last, ZBNF farmers perceived changes in household livelihood outcomes
such as improved well-being, especially health, cultivation cost reduction, improved soil 
characteristics and decreased vulnerability to external shocks. However, the well-being of women 
from a lower class might be affected differently due to the increased workload associated with ZBNF. 
Concerning the broader field of agroecology, this research has found some evidence for its 
transformative aspects confronting industrial (inter) national food systems. It showed how 
intersectional identities are embedded in multiple aspects of ZBNF, such as intra-household decision-
making and women’s involvement in agriculture. At last, this research shows the usefulness of 
investigating sustainable livelihood from multiple levels of analysis, unravelling otherwise hidden

Women’s perspectives on non-migration decisions in the face of environmental risks: A comparative multi-case study in Bangladesh","['Gunsenheimer, Sarah']","['Mallick, Bishawjit']",2023-10-17T01:01:34Z,EN,['environmental non-migration; women’s perspectives; gender inequality; Bangladesh; intersectionality'],International Development Studies,"Bangladesh, being highly vulnerable to cyclones, floods, and droughts, is among the countries most affected by climate change. Within the Bangladeshi society, gender inequalities place women's health and livelihoods at particular risk. Women also face limited opportunities for migration due to restricted access to resources and societal expectations regarding their roles. Given the non-gender-neutral nature of the climate crisis, this research delves into women's perspectives on non-migration decision-making processes amidst climate change-induced risks, exploring voluntary and involuntary non-migration decisions. Employing a multi-case study design, the study compares decision-making processes of women in both rural and urban settings. A combination of observational data, in-depth interviews, and visual storytelling is used to explore the subject comprehensively. The findings reveal a general trend, with rural women expressing a preference to remain due to place attachment and strong community bonds, while urban women tend to desire migration due to adverse living conditions and a sense of place disconnection. The study highlights the intersectionality of social identities, such as class, religion, education level, and age, in shaping women's experiences and aspirations. Through this research, a deeper understanding of women's perspectives on non-migration emerges, offering insights that can inform gender-transformative policies and interventions in the context of climate change-induced risks in Bangladesh."
The Galapagos Paradox: Negotiating Conservation and Human Development,"['Druten, Sarah van']","['Dittgen, Romain']",2023-10-17T01:01:27Z,EN,"['political ecology, conservation policies, environmental governance, neoliberal conservation, living conditions, Galapagos islands']",International Development Studies,"This research examines how conservation policies shape the living conditions of residents of Santa Cruz, the most populated island of the Galapagos Island in Ecuador. By using a political ecology framework, this research aims to understand how the economic and political factors of conservation policies shape local living conditions. Through a combination of in-depth interviews, observations and informal conversations this research sheds a light on the complex trade-offs between conservation and human development. The creation of the Galapagos reserve resulted in a significant shift in power dynamics, moving authority from locals to foreign organizations and, eventually, the Ecuadorian government. Later on, the government’s economic interest in tourism has driven its expansion alongside conservation. The prioritization of nature conservation and the development of a tourism-friendly island have overshadowed investments in local services and increased competition over resources. The unequal power dynamics intensifies the situation as locals experience unequal distribution of benefits and burdens. Conservation policies contributed to the transformation of traditional livelihoods towards the service sector. Furthermore, policies also shaped human-environmental relations of residents. Local disempowerment and the commodification of nature have resulted in a disconnection towards their surroundings. Another result of the unequal power allocation and conservation policies is the discontent among some residents which results in resistance and non-compliance of some rules. The findings of this research contribute to a broader understanding of the socio- environmental challenges and opportunities in conservation policy implementation, with implications for sustainable development and to create more inclusive development strategies in the Galapagos and similar contexts around the world. Future efforts should stress environmental education, local agency, and collaborative nature-society relations."

Navigating indoor spaces requires indoor models. Depending on the use, such indoor models may need to be created quickly, such as in an emergency. Creating these models in real-time could help emergency responders to better interpret the situation by applying location-based services on the models that are created on-the-fly, such as navigation and spatial measurements. These services also requires a sufficient quality of the models. This work presents a methodology for automatically creating an IndoorGML model from a benchmark dataset in near real-time using a simulation of the scanning process. The timestamps of the dataset was used to simulate the scanning of the building. The rooms were identified and reconstructed by detecting the doorways and extracting the points scanned prior to detection. The results demonstrate the models' completeness but highlight challenges such as limitation in accuracy of the geometry and a delayed reconstruction of the doorways and navigation graph. This work contributes to science in a unique way by exploring how to create an indoor spatial model in real-time, and highlighting the challenges involved. At the same time, it also considers how to evaluate such a model."
Shrinkage and migration: problem or not?,"['Versteegen, Joris']","['Szytniewski, Bianca']",2023-10-17T01:01:29Z,EN,['Population shrinkage; Migration; Regional perspective; Media analysis; Framing; Discourse; Regional newspapers; Othering; Ageing'],International Development Studies,"This thesis examined the way Dutch regional newspapers reported on the topics of shrinkage and migration in Dutch shrinking areas. The framing of and discourse on both these topics influences the way people think about shrinkage and migration in their local area, which in turn has an impact on policy. A better understanding of the role of regional news media in forming the discourse on these topics helps us be more critical news consumers and look at topics we care about with more nuance. Finally this could lead to a more informed public and contribute to a healthy democracy.
For this research the northern region of Groningen-Drenthe, with the newspaper ‘Dagblad van het Noorden’ and the southern region of Limburg, with the newspaper ‘de Limburger’ were looked at. Both regions are classified as shrinking areas by the Dutch government. A news media analysis of newspaper articles from these two Dutch regional newspapers over the period of 2015 until 2022 showed that the frames and discourses on both the topics of shrinkage and migration were roughly similar in both newspapers, likely due to key similarities between the two regions. The newspaper de Limburger framed migrants slightly more negatively in comparison to the newspaper Dagblad van het Noorden. What stood out was the large number of articles on refugees; although being the smallest group of migrants coming to the Netherlands, this group was overrepresented in articles in both newspapers.
Both newspapers were mostly similar in their reporting on the topic of shrinkage and its effects. The dominant discourse posited shrinkage as a problem. A counter-discourse, mostly found in opinion articles in both newspaper challenged this negative framing often stating that the problems of shrinkage were exaggerated. A significant part of the discourse on shrinkage concerned the ageing population, a problem which both regions face."

Cambodia reacted to the impact of the compound
shock on their livelihoods from 2020 to 2023. The compound shock consists of the COVID-19 pandemic
and the 5Fs crisis, comprising further disruptions in the prices for food, feed, fuel, fertilizer, and the
accessibility of finance for agriculture. The research is exploratory and built upon livelihood theory,
focusing on adaptation and coping strategies. The study gathered data through 25 interviews with
smallholder farmer households. The findings show that the impacts of the compound shock are
primarily related to price inflations and mobility restrictions. The identified consequences include
reduced profitability of farming activities and a worse household financial position. Diversified income
sources and the possibility of using their production for consumption did dampen the severity of the
impacts for some households. The findings show that most households used savings and the sale of
non-productive assets to cope with the impacts. The employed strategies do not per se affect livelihood
sustainability, but they do erode the buffer capacity of the households. Based on the findings, the study
makes several policy recommendations to strengthen the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, including
stimulating diversified income on-farm and off-farm, re-engaging youth, and giving incentives for a
switch to organic farming."

Europe's energy crisis as an unintended consequence of Ostpolitik: How the maneuverability of German foreign policy became increasingly narrow and eventually deadlocked,"['Draaijer, Tom']","['Boon, Marten']",2023-10-31T00:00:42Z,EN,"['Ostpolitik, historical institutionalism, Nord Stream 2, critical junctures, unintended consequences']",International Relations in Historical Perspective,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted Germany to abandon its Ostpolitik foreign policy, 
which aimed at fostering closer ties with Russia through economic cooperation on the basis of 
energy agreements. Although Germany has now shifted towards military power and European 
defense following Scholz’s Zeitenwende speech in February 2022, its alignment with its Western 
allies has been complex, as evidenced by the tensions surrounding the Nord Stream 2 project.
Moreover, Germany’s Ostpolitik significantly contributed to the current German and European 
energy dependence on Russia. To understand the influence of German energy policy on its 
adherence to Ostpolitik and the divergence from its allied partners' Russia policy, this study 
examines three critical junctures represented by the Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhhorod gas agreement in 
1981, the Nord Stream 1 agreement in 2005, and the Nord Stream 2 agreement in 2015.
Employing the theoretical framework of historical institutionalism, the study reveals how 
these policy decisions, favoring Russian gas, gradually locked Germany into a path dependency. It 
uncovers a self-reinforcing mechanism within Ostpolitik, where economic interdependencies with 
Russia consistently took precedence over alternative energy options. Additionally, unintended 
consequences of the policy gave rise to German-Russian networks across economic, political, and 
cultural dimensions, institutionalizing Ostpolitik and influencing social perceptions in its favor. 
Ultimately, the study concludes that Germany’s divergence from its allied partners can be 
attributed to the persistent influence of Ostpolitik and its self-reinforcing feedback loop, 
underscoring the evolving nature of the concept beyond a static foreign policy."
Optimal Control of Lettuce Greenhouse Horticulture using Model-Free Reinforcement Learning,"['Jansen, Yde']","['Alechina, Natasha']",2023-08-30T23:01:00Z,EN,"['Greenhouse, horticulture, optimal control, reinforcement learning, optimization, weather forecast']",Artificial Intelligence,"A greenhouse is an important growing system that can provide a controlled climate environment and
allow for crop growth in a changing outdoor climate. Due to the high energy cost, labor and resource
scarcity, optimal and automated control of greenhouse horticulture is becoming more and more important
with the aim of optimizing resource usage while maximizing crop production. Outdoor weather is
a critical disturbance when controlling greenhouse climate and it complicates the modelling and optimization
processes.
With the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and improved sensing techniques, Reinforcement
Learning (RL) is getting more and more attention due to its learning-based control strategies,
independent from having a good model. Up to now, most of the RL applications in greenhouse climate
control do not consider outdoor weather forecast while making control decisions, which means plenty
of useful information is missed and this might lead to control actions which are not optimal. Therefore
in this project, we investigated how weather forecast horizons will affect optimal control of greenhouse
horticulture using reinforcement learning.
After going through different deep RL approaches, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Twin-Delayed
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) stand out because of their capacity to consider continuous
state-action space. As the weather prediction will mainly work well in the short-term due to forecast
uncertainty, moreover, long-term weather forecast will bring various unnecessary noise and a large state
space. As a result, our work mainly focused on short-term weather forecast horizons of 0, 3, 7, 11, 15,
19, 23 time steps of fifteen minutes. To investigate how horizons can affect the control performance,
these seven different horizons were used in experiments using the state-of-the-art continuous control
algorithms, SAC and TD3.
After demonstrating the proposed approaches in a lettuce greenhouse, we found that SAC consistently
performed better than TD3 with higher rewards in terms of crop production and net profit,
while resource use was comparable. Furthermore, inclusion of weather forecasts proved essential for
both algorithm learning stability, as well as its training and generalization performance, resulting in
increased yields and net profits, while reducing resource use and the amount of indoor climate constraint
violations. Moreover, we can also conclude that four hours of weather forecast is the best option.
Longer predictions did not increase performance, whereas using shorter forecasts quickly degraded
performance."

A Comprehensive Review","['Baehr, Marianna']","['Keizer, Peter de']",2023-10-30T00:00:47Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"Chronic liver diseases remain a worldwide leading cause of mortality and morbidity. A link between the disease progression and burden of senescent cells in the organ has been established. There is 
a growing interest in assessing the effectiveness of anti-senescence drugs in liver diseases. However, despite the increased curiosity, a general review of the advances in the field was missing. We show the anti-senescence drugs and their testing setups, as well as present novel, promising drug-screening liver platforms. We found that despite a high number of anti-senescence agents, many of them were not tested specifically for liver disease. Our research concentrated on newly designed compounds specifically to target senescence, as well as repurposed drugs while providing background into intricacies of senescence as a highly ambivalent cellular process. The compounds were tested usually using two-dimensional cell lines or mice models, with little to no focus on three-dimensional in vitro setups. In these cases, we provided examples of novel liver experimental techniques such as organoids, spheroids, liver buds, organs-on-chip, and bioprinting, that could be applied to senescence research. The mechanisms of action of the described compounds varied greatly- with some of them not targeting senescence directly. Their testing platforms were mostly either too simple or too complex for the beginning stages of drug development. Given that liver disease is still highly undiagnosed, and its increasing prevalence is being prognosed, we believe that there is a need for physiologically relevant models that are also time and money-efficient for correct assessment of novel anti-senescence compounds."

systems can enforce certain biases and cause a lack of diversity within their recommendations. 
Research has focused on countering these problems with the use of context-dependent recommender 
systems. Interestingly, there has been a lack of focus on activity based music listening behavior. This 
study uses different analysis methods to research the correlation between user activity context and 
musical preferences. Results show that there are significant differences between different activities and 
the musical features that are contained within a song. Thereby suggesting a use for activity context 
within music recommender systems. Contrastingly, results from the clustering, classification and the 
user survey show that it remains difficult to determine which songs are listened to in which contexts of 
activity. On top of showing that musical taste can not solely be determined by activity, these results 
show that musical preference remains distinctly subjective and recommendation algorithms will 
forever struggle in determining the right music for the right person at the right time. Concluding, while 
activity context shows promise in being useful in recommending music and helping overcome biases 
and lack of diversity within recommendations, an activity based method should be combined with 
other algorithms such as content based recommenders. Thereby helping to adhere to users’ broad and 
expansive musical preferences while ensuring relevant and personal recommendations."

This domain perspective is chosen so that domain experts without process mining experience can learn the opportunities and challenges that are specific to their domain. The results show little difference between the domains regarding the types and perspectives of process mining. There are differences between domains in opportunities and challenges. Some are shared by multiple domains whilst others are domain-specific as they originate from the characteristics of that domain.

Healthy Choices in Transportation,"['Beek, Dagmar van']","['Kamphuis, Carlijn']",2023-10-27T23:01:09Z,EN,"['transportation choice, health values, active transportation, car use']","Social Challenges, Policies and Interventions","Background: Globally obesity rates and car use are increasing. Active transportation is suggested to mitigate both problems. In the Netherlands, 47% of all car trips are short-distance trips under 7.5 km, which can easily be converted into active transportation modes, such as walking or cycling. Most Dutch citizens do agree on the importance of exercise and movement, with fitness being the most practiced sport. The aim of this research is to explore the relationship between the health values of Dutch active gym members and their transportation mode choices. To ultimately broaden transportation choice literature as well as serve to develop more efficient and effective transportation policies or interventions. Methods: A total of nineteen active gym members of a local gym in Utrecht have been interviewed, nine car users, and ten cyclists. Interviews contained topics relating to transportation behavior, health values, and a combination of the two. Interviews were coded using Nvivo and analyzed alongside existing literature and conceptual framework. 
Results: Cyclists and car users have similar health values but differ in sports-related goals. Cyclists primarily focus on preventing health-related ailments and maintaining fitness, while car users mainly work out to build muscle. The type of sports-related goals was strongly linked to chosen transportation mode. Other aspects that can support or undermine the use of active transportation were habit, attitude toward cycling, and experienced barriers to cycling. Conclusion: Car users do value their health and are aware cycling is healthier, however, cycling is often not aligned with sports-related goals. Other factors such as habit, attitude, and experienced barriers often override the health benefits associated with cycling. Interventions that focus on providing knowledge on health benefits and policies that create barriers to car use are recommended."

In order to lower this rate, it is necessary to reach the 95-95-95 goals from the Joint United Nations Programme. The accomplishment of these goals will be more realistic by concentrating on rising the number of HIV infected individuals having a suppressed viral load. According to earlier research, a behavioural and social approach will be effective in addressing this. Since there is a gap in published research regarding experiences with ART adherence and (the implementation of) viral load testing in eSwatini this thesis studies the existing gap using the concepts of medicalisation and biopower. The following research question is formulated: How do people with HIV and health providers experience and practice HIV treatment adherence and HIV viral load testing in the context of an implementation study in eSwatini? This research question is answered by using a qualitative research design, using in-depth and semi-structured interviews. Initially, sensitising concepts were established, which supported coding of the transcribed interviews. It was expected that people living with HIV would feel empowered because of the use of viral load tests. Nevertheless, due to power dynamics between health providers and people living with HIV this was not the case. In the context of the MaxART study in eSwatini, people with HIV did not feel empowered because their HIV treatment adherence was medicalised, and they explained that they felt criticised."

While most protocols rely on static culture systems to create these cell aggregates, scalability limitations have impeded their broader application. In this regard, dynamic culture systems offer an advantageous approach by enabling automated aggregate production, which not only ensures scalability and workload reduction but also aligns with good manufacturing practices (GMP) and facilitate clinical translation. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of collision-based self-assembly of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (hBM-MSC) aggregates and their subsequent chondrogenic differentiation within the same spinner flask setup. Moreover, qualitative analyses of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) protein expression were performed to study the effect of the hydrodynamic environment on cell aggregation in comparison to static culture. Given that stirring rate influences cell-cell collisions, in this study different velocities of the spinner flask were examined to determine the most favourable one for spontaneous hBM-MSC aggregate formation. The identification of appropriate stirring rate allowed dynamic spinner flask culture (1x10^6 cells/mL) of the spontaneously formed aggregates for up to 21 days using two different donors. Dynamically cultured aggregates showed significant variation in aggregates size and shape as opposed to static culture. Importantly, dynamic culture did not affect aggregate viability, although cell death was observed due to the large size of the aggregates. When assessing cell differentiation, staining of dynamically cultured aggregate sections for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and collagen II showed inter- and intra-aggregate heterogeneity in comparison to static culture. Moreover, NCAM protein expression was not modulated by the hydrodynamic environment, although reduction on its expression was observed in chondrogenically differentiated cells within the aggregates.

However, the observation of considerable heterogeneity in dynamic culture highlights the need for further exploration to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms governing these variations."

Despite the predominant link to poultry, pigs are a significant source of infection. This scoping review delves into the understanding and implications of the monophasic variant of Salmonella Typhimurium (MST) in pigs within the EU between 2018 and 2023. It also explores the challenges associated with controlling Salmonella and discusses how genomic studies have been instrumental in refining current predictive models.
A rigorous screening process led to the inclusion of 35 studies. Key findings elucidate the growing epidemiological significance of MST in the pig sector and its increasing association with multi-drug resistance. The review also identifies gaps in country-specific data from 15 EU Member States, emphasizing a need for a comprehensive, EU-wide approach. The challenges tied to Salmonella control in pigs arise from varying contamination levels, the continuous evolution of Salmonella strains, and a pressing need to enhance surveillance measures.
Genomic studies have been pivotal in refining current predictive models, but a lack of real-time monitoring data is a hurdle. An integrated One Health approach, combining human, animal, and environmental health considerations, may offer a path forward. This research paper underscores the critical role of interdisciplinary efforts, routine audits, and engagement with the pork industry to devise targeted interventions. The study concludes by emphasizing the importance of real-time data collection and continuous refinement of existing strategies to effectively combat the threat of salmonellosis in the EU."
Fairness and Explainability in Chest X-ray Image Classifiers,"['Bel Bordes, Gemma']","['Giachanou, Anastasia']",2023-11-05T00:00:46Z,EN,[],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare, particularly for interpreting medical images. However, there are growing concerns regarding the presence of biases in these AI models, which raise important fairness considerations. This study investigates biases in artificial intelligence (AI) models for chest X-ray diagnosis and explores the role of Explainable AI (XAI) in understanding model decisions. Biases were observed in model performance across different patient groups and diseases. Various XAI techniques were employed to generate explanations for model decisions, and comparisons were made with explanations provided by doctors. We identified an optimized version of occlusion as the most accurate XAI technique in this case, which also provided a consistent accuracy of the explanations across all patient groups. Indeed, the explanations remained equally accurate regardless of variations in model performance for different subgroups,
suggesting the absence of model bias amplification. Evaluating the correctness of XAI explanations posed challenges due to the limited availability of ground truth. In order to increase the power of our analysis, we explored alternative evaluation methods, like deletion or insertion curves, but reported them as unsuitable for chest X-ray images. We have therefore established some recommendations for using XAI on chest X-ray images. Given the reported absence of biases in the explanations, our aim is also to instill confidence in clinical stakeholders regarding XAI techniques."

Still, in the Netherlands >30% of women with breast cancer undergo a mastectomy. Partial breast reconstruction aims to provide better esthetic outcomes, quality of life and patient satisfaction in large breast tumors, preventing mastectomy. This can be achieved, among other techniques, using chest wall perforator flaps. Drain use often combined with overnight hospital stay used to be common practice. The aim of this study is to investigate whether omitting drains following chest wall perforator flaps reconstruction in daycare is safe regarding postoperative complications. Secondary outcome is patient satisfaction as reported in the Breast-Q questionnaire. METHODS 36 patients were included for this retrospective study. Data was extracted from the electronic patient record. Breast-Q questionnaires were sent to patients. Complications were scored according to Clavien-Dindo after 30 days, 60 days and 6 months. Results were compared with literature. RESULTS Overall complication rate was 41,7% after 30 days, 25% after 60 days and 13,9% after 6 months. The Breast-Q response rate was 66,7%. Breast-Q scores were: psychosocial well-being 83, satisfaction with breast 80 and physical well-being 75. DISCUSSION The results of this study were similar to results found in previous studies. Breast conserving surgery with partial breast reconstruction using chest wall perforator flaps without using suction drains in daycare treatment is feasible."

environments. Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domains are well-known environmental sensors that are widespread in bacteria, archaea, plants and other eukaryotes. While plant LOV proteins have yet only been found to have light-sensing roles, the conservation and divergent roles of LOV domains in other kingdoms of the tree of life suggests a possible additional role for plant LOV domains in oxygen sensing. Here, we describe the role of plant LOV domains in light perception and we investigate whether plant LOV proteins could indeed function in oxygen sensing by analyzing the roles and mechanisms of LOV domains in light sensing proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana as well as oxygen sensing roles of LOVs in other species. Both commonalities and differences are seen for light-sensing proteins regarding the roles of their LOV domains, and their functioning appears to be flexible. Looking at the oxygen sensor proteins, it is noticeable that all described oxygen-sensing proteins function via changes in redox status of the FMN/FAD cofactors, and that it was often seen to go together with light sensing functions. Known plant LOV proteins could thus possibly have an extended redox-based oxygen sensing role. Lastly, as some highly similar PAS domains are found to be involved in Light-Oxygen-Voltage, we propose a new protein family LOV related (LOVr)."

fractures. However, data about the influence of MCI on complications after hip surgery is scarce, and 
studies using standardized test are missing. The main aim of this study was to identify the influence 
of the outcome of the Mini-Cog on postoperative complications, in patients aged ≥65 years, with a 
proximal femur fracture undergoing hip surgery.

Methods:
This is a substudy of the MCHOPIN study, a multicenter prospective cohort study. Data is based on 
the database set of the MCHOPIN study. The primary outcome of interest was postoperative 
complications. Subgroup analyses for sex and age were performed. 

Results: 
A total of 351 patients were included in this study. They were categorized according to their outcome 
of the Mini-Cog, into the ‘’possibly not mild cognitive impaired group’’ also the Mini-Cog - group 
(n=230) and the ‘’probably mild cognitive impaired group’’ also the Mini-Cog + group (n=121). 42.5% 
of all the included patients developed postoperative complications. Significant statistical differences 
were seen in the total amount of postoperative complications between the Mini-Cog – and the MiniCog + group. More in the Mini-Cog + group developed postoperative complications. After preforming 
subgroup analyses no statistically difference were found. 

Conclusion: 
More postoperative complications in the Mini-Cog + group were found. However this study, shows 
the complexity between the different confounding factors, and their influence on postoperative 
complications. For further research it is recommended that more confounding factors on 
postoperative complications and MCI should be identified."

The disease is characterised by retinal vasculopathy, white matter lesions, focal and global brain dysfunction, and several systemic manifestations. These symptoms arise from C-terminal truncating mutations in the three prime repair exonuclease-1 (TREX1) gene. The mutations lead to the insertion of a premature stop codon, inducing the production of truncated proteins. How these truncated proteins exactly cause the disease manifestations is not yet known. However, prior studies appeared to indicate endothelial dysfunction as an important mechanism. Besides endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and serotonergic system malfunction have also been proposed as potential underlying mechanisms. Hence, these processes could potentially help to bridge the gap between the truncated TREX1 proteins and the clinical manifestations of RVCL-S. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the main suggested theories concerning the pathophysiology of RVCL-S, including ideas for diagnostic markers and novel therapeutic targets"

Employing a cross-sectional design, we surveyed 129 participants from non-western backgrounds. The survey encompassed demographic data, attitudes toward Covid-19 regulations, personal Covid-19 encounters (operationalized as Covid experience), and acquaintances' Covid-19-related deaths. Established scales, including the Flexibility Index Test (FIT-24) and RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (RAND SF-36), quantified psychological flexibility (PF) and assessed quality of life (QoL). Contrary to expectations, Covid experience (CE) and known fatalities (D) did not significantly predict PF or QoL. However, a positive link between PF and QoL was observed. Notably, PF did not moderate the relationship between Covid-19 distress indicators and QoL, as initially hypothesized. In summary, the findings demonstrate a positive link between PF and QoL. However, PF moderating the relationship between CE/D and QoL was not observed. This underscores the unique impact of PF on well-being within the context of Covid-19."

Ever since its discovery, science has been trying to create drugs from mRNA, which finally materialized in the form of the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 messenger RNA vaccines. Stability has long been an issue in mRNA vaccine design. The instability of mRNA molecules can partly be found in the composition and modification of its nucleotides. Pseudouridine nucleotide modifications stabilized mRNA enough for clinical use, whereas RNAs high in adenosine and uridine nucleotides or those containing UpA or CpG dinucleotides are degraded more quickly than RNAs lacking the (di)nucleotides. This leads to a natural suppression of CpG and UpA dinucleotides in mRNA. The cause of CpG dinucleotide suppression can be found in DNA methylation, where methylated CpG DNA can spontaneously deaminate into TpG dinucleotides. The cause of UpA dinucleotide suppression is however unconfirmed but might find its roots in RNA editing, CpG methylation or gene expression. Degradation of UpA dinucleotide-containing mRNAs is similarly uncertain and may be attributed to RNase L or AU-rich element RNA binding proteins (AUBP), which can stabilize or destabilize mRNA. Herein, current theories on UpA suppression and degradation will be reviewed in addition to adenosine and uridine modifications to discuss which factors surrounding (di)nucleotides and nucleotide modifications influence the stability of mRNA. Finally, this review hypothesizes a link between evolution towards UpA dinucleotide suppression and avoidance of destabilizing AUBP binding."

LCNC frameworks are easy to use, visual drag-and-drop development platforms that enable employees with domain knowledge to develop applications without a proper programming background (citizen developers). This study assessed how three different LCNC frameworks, SAP Build, Mendix and Neptune compare based on a quantification method of their feature set. Furthermore, the strengths and weaknesses of these LCNC frameworks are determined and analysed based on their impact on the IT world. The findings show that Mendix has the average highest potential based on its features, having the highest collaborative development support and the most graphical user interface features. SAP Build has the strongest interoperability support, and the strength of Neptune is within the reusability feature. The strengths and weaknesses of each LCNC framework differ, therefore the impact of each LCNC is dependent on the specific use case. A recommendation to Accenture is made on how to position LCNC frameworks to their clients based on this research. LCNC framework adoption leads to the overall benefits
of an increased development speed and cost reduction and drawbacks in customisability in general. The recommendation for a specific LCNC framework highly depends on the needs and sector of the client."

machineries aimed at the faithful division of the complete genome into two identical daughter
cells. Errors in this regulation can lead to aberrant chromosome segregation and often cause a
form of chromosomal instability (CIN). This cellular phenotype is frequently found in cancer and
other malignancies and can arise through mutations in important regulatory tumor suppressor
genes or the overactivation of oncogenes. Besides cellular oncogenes, numerous viral
oncogenes have been described over the last decades. The targets of these viral proteins are
often important regulators of mitosis. This viral influence on mitotic regulation can interfere with
normal chromosome segregation, increasing the risk of CIN. This review discusses how viral
proteins interfere with the cellular machinery that ensures faithful chromosome segregation,
using a selection of examples. Viruses can deregulate cell cycle progression by interacting with
proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoints or DNA repair, activating or inhibiting the anaphase
promoting complex (APC/C), causing centrosome overduplication, (de)stabilizing microtubules,
or disturbing cytokinesis. Examples are provided for each of these interactions, intermittently
focusing on retroviruses and especially the Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1).
Implications are drawn for cancer research and virology, and a possibility for the use of CINinducing
viral proteins as a mechanism to enhance oncolytic viral therapy is considered. The
interplay between viruses and the cell cycle is an important field that requires more
interdisciplinary efforts in research and can contribute greatly to our knowledge of the origins of
cancer and possible treatments."

However, therapeutic peptides require carriers to reach the tumour site, as they are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream. The advancement of nanomedicine allows us to solve this challenge by entrapping the peptide inside polymeric micelles. Passive targeting, using the Enhanced Permeability and Retention effect (EPR) and selective release of cargo from the nanocarrier in response to stimuli endogenous to tumour tissue (such as reduced pH), are envisioned to be implemented in the delivery approach. This work exam-ines three maleic anhydride derivatives as possible substrates for pH-sensitive linker synthesis on a model therapeutic peptide. The novel aspect of this study is binding a model peptide into polymeric micelles using a maleic acid amide-based linker. Although these maleic anhydrides have been previously employed for pH-sensitive drug delivery applications, in this study, side product formation significantly decreased the effectiveness of the investigated tool. The results presented in this work raise questions towards the employment of maleic amide derivatives in such systems as side product interference could not be avoided."

The existing solver was implemented partly on the CPU and partly on the GPU, leading a large performance overhead due to context switches. This, among other performance issues, made it unfeasible for practical application. Additionally, the grid-based manner in which the boundaries for solids were implemented limited the range of problems it could accurately depict and solve. Moreover, the abundance of hard-coded features made it cumbersome to use. In this thesis, these problems are resolved as follows: Nearly the entire solver has been ported to the GPU, eliminating the performance overhead introduced by context switches. A host of additional runtime and memory optimizations are implemented into the program. The implementation of boundaries has been improved to handle arbitrary geometries. Finally, a basic command-line interface has been introduced to set a range of solver parameters when launching the program. In optimal situations the runtime is decreased by a factor exceeding 1000x and the memory footprint is reduced by up to a petabyte. In more general cases the runtime decrease is often in the triple digits and the footprint is reduced by many gigabytes. With the introduced improvements the way is paved for the solver to be a tool that is used by researchers in the field of fluid dynamics."

Nevertheless, this task cannot be solely completed by humans, and therefore requires the utilization of Machine Learning (ML) models. However, a concern arises in terms of the lack of transparency of these models, which could have major consequences in high-stake scenarios. Hence, it is critical to provide explanations if we anticipate using such models in fields such as law enforcement. However, many visualisations have been developed to explicate Machine Learning (ML) models for data scientists instead of decision makers. This creates an issue as data scientists have distinct objectives when interacting with an ML model compared to decision makers. While data scientists possess technical knowledge, they lack domain knowledge and seek solutions to improve the model. Conversely, decision makers utilise the model’s output to inform their decision making processes. They possess domain knowledge but lack technical expertise. Due to distinct characteristics and different requirements when dealing with ML models, they also require a different explanations. In collaboration with the National Police Lab Artificial Intelligence (NPAI), this research developed a way to effectively visualise local explanations of ML models for decision makers in the law enforcement domain. We focused on decision makers within public order and safety domains. The interviews unveiled several prerequisites that were integrated into the design. The evaluation demonstrated that decision makers comprehended the visualization and that the tool facilitated decision making. Nevertheless, it emerged that the explanation was not entirely comprehensible to the decision makers. They could pinpoint the characteristics that influenced the classification of the risk and identify the risk that the model attributed to the incident. However, they lacked the ability to discern which features made a larger contribution, and the uncertainty score proved challenging to interpret."

Van piramide naar cirkel,"['Zuijdendorp, Maaike']","['Amsterdam, N. van']",2023-10-03T00:00:44Z,NL,"['Holacracy, zelfsturende organisaties']","Organisaties, verandering en management","Hoewel de meeste organisaties zijn georganiseerd volgens een management hiërarchie kent deze organisatievorm nadelen als rigiditeit en bureaucratie, die vooral problematisch zijn omdat de huidige organisatie context dynamisch en complex is. Er wordt al jarenlang, door zowel organisatiewetenschappers en beoefenaars gezocht naar alternatieven voor de management hiërarchie. Een stroming van zelfsturende organisaties probeert aan deze nadelen te ontkomen door de management hiërarchie te verwijderen en autoriteit radicaal te decentraliseren. Dit onderzoek komt te gemoed aan de behoefte aan meer onderzoek naar ervaringen van medewerkers in zelfsturende organisaties. De zelfsturende organisatiemethode die is onderzocht is holacracy, een methode van zelfsturing waar nog weinig empirisch onderzoek naar is gedaan. De centrale onderzoeksvraag is: hoe ervaren medewerkers holacratisch werken?
Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd via de kwalitatieve methoden interviews, observaties en bestudering van documenten. Er is gekozen voor kwalitatieve methoden om zo de ervaringen van medewerkers uit eerste persoonsperspectief te begrijpen en zo in de beschrijving ervan recht te kunnen doen aan de complexiteit en meerstemmigheid van ervaringen.
De resultaten laten zien dat door de gedecentraliseerde besluitvorming medewerkers meer autonomie en snelheid in besluitvorming ervaren. Ook wordt de vrijheid gewaardeerd om het takenpakket zelf samen te stellen. Het wegvallen van de manager-ondergeschikte relatie wordt door sommige uitvoerend medewerkers als plezierig ervaren, anderen missen hierdoor sturing. Voor oud- managers is het wegvallen van deze hiërarchische relatie een uitdaging omdat er grote verandering in hun gedrag wordt verwacht. Deze gegevens maken dat het niet altijd lukt volgens het formele systeem van decentralisatie van autoriteit te werken. In het maken van beslissingen wordt soms nog gezocht naar consensus of er vindt beïnvloeding plaats door medewerkers zonder formele autoriteit. Bij beïnvloeding speelt de informele hiërarchie een rol.
De belangrijkste conclusie is dat holacratisch werken genuanceerd wordt ervaren. Op de ervaringen van medewerkers zijn vooral het wegvallen van de hiërarchische manager-ondergeschikte relatie en het niet altijd werken volgens de formele gedecentraliseerde autoriteit van invloed. Doordat het formele systeem niet altijd wordt nageleefd lijkt er een informele hiërarchie te bestaan waarin de oude management hiërarchie doorwerkt.
Dit onderzoek draagt bij aan wetenschappelijke en maatschappelijke zoektocht naar alternatieven voor de management hiërarchie en biedt organisaties inzichten om holacracy succesvol te implementeren.
Beperkingen zijn dat slechts de ervaringen van enkele medewerkers zijn onderzocht bij een beperkt aantal holacratische organisaties. Dankzij de hiaten in de organisatiemethode, het aanpassen van de methode aan de organisatiecontext en het niet altijd werken volgens de formele regels bestaat de kans dat verschillen in ervaringen eerder hieraan te wijten zijn dan aan de organisatiemethode zelf. Verder volgt mijn belangrijkste beperking uit de bevinding dat het organisaties niet lukt de methode zuiver toe te passen. Hierdoor is het niet mogelijk geweest om de potentiële ervaring van het organisatiemodel bloot te leggen.
Vervolgonderzoek zou kunnen differentiëren tussen ervaringen van verschillende type medewerkers en persoonlijkheden. Daarnaast zou verder onderzocht kunnen worden of de niet persoonsgebonden manier waarop holacracy autoriteit decentraliseert kenmerkend is voor holacracy of dat dit voor alle zelfsturende organisaties geldt. Ook kan in vervolgonderzoek aan dacht uitgaan naar de informele hiërarchie binnen holacracy en de mogelijke nadelen die hierdoor worden ervaren."

guidance, and a lack of structure resulting in this field being stuck in high-level principles and guidelines,
fostering an environment where organisations are adopting their own interpretation of PbD which leads
to inconsistent practices and potentially suboptimal solutions. The aim of this research is twofold: (1)
structure the privacy-by-design domain by identifying key factors and formulating greater themes and
categories to gain an understanding of the functional composition, and (2) create a concrete guiding
artifact for the application of PbD in the form of a focus area maturity model to aid practitioners in
closing the gap between principles and real design. This research used design science as the overarching
paradigm guiding the creation of the maturity model artifact. A concrete maturity model design method
was constructed based on method fragments from existing methods that target maturity models. Two
multivocal literature reviews were conducted to find PbD factors which were aggregated through a
coding approach and subsequently used for the formulation of maturity model elements that populate
the maturity matrix. The validation consisted of a focus group interview and the evaluation consisted of
a survey presented to participants who had performed an assessment using the created assessment
instrument. The main result of this research is a focus area maturity model for privacy-by-design. The
proposed model allows organisations to assess their PbD maturity and it suggests improvement actions
for maturity development. The accompanying assessment instrument consists of a web-based tool that
provides an automated assessment experience and can generate a shareable maturity report. The overall
PbD maturity of organisations who performed an assessment was found to be low with all but one not
reaching the first maturity level. Practitioner attitude towards the proposed model was neutral to
moderately positive. Additional research should address the limitations of this work by aiming to
increase the generalisability of the proposed model for different legal systems and organisation types,
and by investigating practitioner attitude on a greater scale."

enquêtes. Zo is de sfeer en onderlinge omgang tussen getuigen en de Enquêtecommissie
hevig veranderd. De Enquête Aardgaswinning Groningen is veel strakker en minder los dan
de RSV-enquête. Die veranderingen en de verschillen in context, hebben echter niet geleid tot
een groter risico op de aanwezigheid van de bevestigingsbias en blame games bij de
Enquêtecommissie.

De conclusie van het onderzoek is dan ook dat de mate waarin de parlementaire enquête als
verantwoordingsinstrument wordt bedreigd door het risico op de aanwezigheid van de
bevestigingsbias en blame games bij parlementaire enquêtecommissies niet groter is
geworden. Dat die bedreiging niet groter is geworden, is een hoopgevende conclusie. Dit
onderzoek is wel verkennend van aard en dus is vervolgonderzoek nodig, maar de Enquête
Aardgaswinning Groningen laat zien dat het instrument nog kan werken in het huidige
politieke landschap. Net zoals de RSV-enquête destijds een ankerpunt was voor veel
daaropvolgende parlementaire enquêtes, zo kan de parlementaire enquête naar de
Aardgaswinning in Groningen dienen als nieuw ankerpunt voor nog komende parlementaire
enquêtes. De Parlementaire Enquête: het kan nog steeds."
Change In ESG-Firm Behaviour After Adoption Of SBTi,"['Schuiling, Valerie']","['Derwall, Jeroen']",2023-10-02T09:12:44Z,EN,['SBTi; ESG; emissions; science-based targets'],Sustainable Finance and Investments,"This thesis studies the Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi) and their effect on corporate ESG-behaviour. Using Refinitiv, a universe of 3,141 firms is created including 962 SBTi companies with the remaining companies being all firms with consistent ESG-Score data from 2013-2021. Applying a firm-fixed effect model I examine three separate hypotheses concerning SBTi adoption affecting emission, ESG-Scores and environmental innovation in the years 2013 until 2021. Over all firms I find a gradual decrease in emissions and increase in ESG and Environmental Innovation Scores across most years, possibly due to recent climate awareness and regulation. The SBTi did not have any significant effect on emission no matter if we look at total emissions, scope one or scope two emissions, showing that setting the targets did not influence company action. ESG and Environmental Innovation Scores on the other hand were slightly negatively influenced, which could result from the SBTi’s stricter regulations, time lags or the financial strain approval fees put on firms. Generally, the research suggests taking a closer look at SBTi firms since greenwashing concerns cannot be disproven."

It is one of the many outcomes of globalisation. Such multilingual environments are particularly apparent in universities, in which obstacles may arise due to the diversity associated with each person’s cultural and linguistic background. As a response, it is suggested that there are several ways to mediate multilingual conversations, including through translation, code-switching, lingua franca and lingua receptiva. This research focuses on the two latter notions, where lingua franca and lingua receptiva are employed to bridge conversations involving parties from various cultural and linguistic contexts. To this end, this research utilizes an experiment model involving a multilinguistic group of 6 (six) participants in a group conversation setting where 2 (two) selected issues are discussed in two separate sessions, each using one of the two communication modes. The data is derived from the content analysis of the discussions using two communication modes as well as in-depth interviews from each participant. The results show that both communication modes are effective in promoting participation among multilingual students in a conversation. However, lingua receptiva has been observed to promote greater inclusion among these participants, especially at preserving the diverse linguistic backgrounds of the participants while still facilitating interaction similar to ELF. For participants who have less knowledge in a particular language, they can rely on the responses of other participants who are proficient in that language to actively participate in the conversation. This demonstrates the benefits of multilingualism and lingua receptiva conversation."

A Multi-Modal Approach to Open Domain Question Answering: Dense Retrieval of Regions-of-Interest,"['Garzoni di Adorgnano, Massimiliano']","['Gatt, A.']",2023-10-20T00:00:46Z,EN,['multi-modal retrieval; transformers; multi-modality; regions-of-interest; open-domain question answering'],Artificial Intelligence,"This master thesis proposes a multi-modal retrieval system for open-domain question answering, building upon dense passage retrievers and incorporating multi-modal information to retrieve candidate regions of interest (ROIs) from document images given a user query. Our main research goal was to investigate the efficacy of dense representations of questions and multi-modal contexts in retrieving relevant content, and evaluating the impact of multi-modal information compared to uni-modal baselines. To this end, the study leverages the VisualMRC dataset which offers annotations for visual components, particularly ROIs such as titles or graphs, to facilitate efficient con- tent retrieval. The proposed methodology involves pre-processing the multi-modal ROIs, employing a bi-encoder setup to encode the question and ROIs separately, and use such encodings to calculate similarity in their shared multi-dimensional embedding space. The training objective is achieved through contrastive learning by passing to the model a question, along with one positive and k negative contexts, and minimizing the loss function by reducing the negative log likelihood associated with the positive ROI. We evaluate our trained models on three different modality scenarios, text-only, vision-only, and multi-modal, and we evaluate their retrieval performance on standard metrics such as Normalized Cumulative Discounted Gain @ k, Mean Reciprocal Rank @ k, and Recall @ k. The results reveal the benefits of both vision-only and multi-modal approaches over text-only, while also highlighting challenges related to the number of negative ROIs. Our results support the first hypothesis but raise questions about the second, suggesting that the inclusion of layout information may not always improve retrieval performance. The strengths of our approach include efficient ROI retrieval and dataset adaptability, while limitations involve dataset variability and encoding techniques. In light of this, we suggest several avenues for future work such as exploring new datasets, incorporating hard negatives in contrastive learning, and refining ROI dissimilarity. Additionally, we speculate that integrating keyword matching and retrieval-augmented generation approaches could enhance the retrieval pipeline. Overall, the present thesis hopes to advance research in multi-modal retrieval models, emphasizing the importance of visual and textual context for open-domain question answering."
Is the Irish political stance towards genetically modified crop cultivation shifting?,"['Leahy, Iseult']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-10-20T00:00:43Z,EN,[],Bio Inspired Innovation,"Historically, Ireland has maintained a firm stance against genetically modified (GM) crop cultivation, resulting in an outright ban. Through examining recent Irish political debates this staunch opposition to GM crops may be slowly shifting. A pivotal moment occurred on March 9th 2022 when scientific expertise was incorporated into the political discussion. Their input highlighted recent advancements in GM technology, assessing the potential benefits and risks of adopting GM crops. The discussion reflected a societal shift in perspectives from concerns of ""playing God"" to new apprehensions of Ireland's agricultural competitiveness on a global scale. Numerous factors may contribute to the evolving political openness toward GM crop adoption. This paper identifies four primary drivers that underpin this shifting perspective. First, our imperative to mitigate the effects of climate change, prompting consideration of GM crops as a potential solution. Second, political post-pandemic willingness towards innovative science. Third, the recent advancements in GM agricultural research. Finally, the economic significance of GM crop cultivation and the impact on Irish farmers if this innovation is not utilised. As the agricultural industry evolves to adapt to changing circumstances, this paper underscores the importance of a nuanced approach that balances public perception, scientific evidence, and economic imperatives in shaping future policy decisions."

Sometimes it pours, drips, or evaporates. It may be barely enough to fill your cup, or spill over the edge. Either way, one is usually thirsty for more, and there is always someone in charge of serving. This thesis explores the extent to which the Dutch East India Company (VOC) attempted and managed to exert authority over the natural knowledge produced by its long-distance information networks in the seventeenth century. It will do so using tea as a case study. First, an overview of the VOC’s knowledge directives created throughout this period will be provided. By carefully analyzing the available archival material, it will be argued that the Company’s administration, apart from being a political, military and colonial enterprise, can and should also be regarded as a producer of knowledge, with strong ambitions pertaining the authority over this knowledge’s content, transmission and security. Then, to better understand to what extent these directives were actually followed, a closer look will be taken at the endeavors of VOC officers to gain natural knowledge of tea and the tea plant. This will be done by first focusing on the information acquired and produced by the Company’s overseas knowledge networks, and then addressing the reception of this knowledge in the Dutch Republic. As we will see, careful (re)consideration of the stories of tea and authority leads not only to new historical insights into both of them, but also to the refutation of the specious dichotomy between restriction and circulation. It will be argued that instead, the VOC’s attitude towards its knowledge-producing activities can better be described as aspiring ‘restrictive circulation’. The story of tea shows that irrespective of this ambition, the hodgepodge of actors and materials moving through space and time calls for more nuanced and varied approaches to the history of commerce. Operating from the field of history of science, this thesis aims to do its bit."

De Relatie Tussen Body Image Exposure op Social Media en het Lichaamsbeeld van Jongens en Meisjes in de van Leeftijd 16-18 jaar,"['Holstege, Daniëlle']","['Henricks, L.A.']",2023-10-20T00:00:48Z,NL,[],"Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Abstract
Tegenwoordig wordt social media veel door adolescenten gebruikt. Toch brengt het gebruik van social media ook zorgen met zich mee. Zo zijn er steeds meer studies die suggereren dat social media een negatieve relatie heeft met het lichaamsbeeld van adolescenten. Daarom is in dit onderzoek het volgende onderzocht: “Wat is de relatie tussen body image exposure op social media en het lichaamsbeeld bij adolescenten in de leeftijd van 16-18 jaar. En is deze relatie verschillend voor jongens en meisjes?”. Body image exposure betekent de mate waarin adolescenten worden blootgesteld aan foto’s rondom het lichaamsbeeld van anderen.
Een online zelf-rapportage vragenlijst is ingevuld door 47 adolescenten in de leeftijd van 16-18 jaar (36.17% jongens/63.83% meisjes, M = 17.34 jaar, SD = 0.79 jaar). Een PROCESS moderatie-analyse is uitgevoerd in SPSS. Hieruit is, tegen de verwachting in, gebleken dat body image exposure op social media geen relatie had met het lichaamsbeeld van adolescenten. Ook verschilde deze relatie niet voor jongens en meisjes. Wel bleek dat gender een significante voorspeller is van lichaamsbeeld, waarbij meisjes een negatiever lichaamsbeeld ervoeren dan jongens.
Voor vervolgonderzoek wordt een grotere en aselecte steekproef aanbevolen. Daarnaast is er een methodologische beperking in hoe het begrip body image exposure is gemeten. Daarom wordt aanbevolen om de onderdelen van dit begrip apart van elkaar te meten. Tot slot is het zinvol als er interventies, gericht op mediawijsheid, worden ingezet voor adolescente meisjes. Het doel daarvan is om hun sociale media kennis te vergroten en hun lichaamsontevredenheid te verminderen."
Gedeelde Aandacht en Taalontwikkeling in Jongens en Meisjes,"['Poel, Marie van de']","['Timmermeister, Mona']",2023-10-20T00:00:53Z,NL,[],"Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat er een verband is tussen geslacht en taalontwikkeling, waarbij meisjes hoger scoren dan jongens. Gedeelde aandacht wordt gezien als een voorspeller van taalontwikkeling, en deze vaardigheid wordt ook eerder ontwikkeld door meisjes. Het is niet bekend of gedeelde aandacht een rol speelt in deze relatie tussen geslacht en taalontwikkeling. Hier onderzochten we of gedeelde aandacht een mediator kan zijn in de relatie tussen geslacht en taalontwikkeling, aan de hand van de volgende onderzoeksvraag; ‘Zijn er verbanden tussen geslacht, gedeelde aandacht en taalontwikkeling bij 2;0 tot 4;11- jarige kinderen, en wordt een mogelijk verband tussen geslacht en taalontwikkeling gemedieerd door gedeelde aandacht?’.
3
De steekproef bestond uit 78 gezonde Nederlandse kinderen (40 jongens en 38 meisjes) tussen 28 en 60 maanden oud. Data over taalontwikkeling werden verzameld door middel van de Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), en data over gedeelde aandacht werden verzameld door middel van de Early Sociocognitiv Battery (ESB). Ten eerste werden drie enkelvoudige lineaire regressies uitgevoerd om de correlatie tussen geslacht, gedeelde aandacht en taalontwikkeling te toetsen. Vervolgens werden de drie variabelen gecombineerd in een mediatiemodel om te analyseren of gedeelde aandacht een mediërend effect heeft dat het verband tussen geslacht en taalontwikkeling zou kunnen verklaren.
Er was geen significant effect tussen geslacht en taalontwikkeling, of tussen geslacht en gedeelde aandacht (mogelijk door het kleine aantal participanten), hoewel meisjes iets hoger scoorden op zowel het gebied van gedeelde aandacht als taalontwikkeling. Opvallend genoeg was er wel een significant effect tussen gedeelde aandacht en taalontwikkeling, wat de mediërende rol van gedeelde aandacht tussen geslacht en taalontwikkeling zou kunnen aangeven.
Het is aannemelijk dat de relatief kleine steekproef de reden is voor het feit dat de correlatie tussen geslacht en taalontwikkeling gevonden in de literatuur niet gereproduceerd werd in dit onderzoek. Echter is de bevinding dat er, zelfs zonder het verband tussen geslacht en taalontwikkeling, een verband is tussen gedeelde aandacht en taalontwikkeling. Dat is indicatief voor een potentiële rol van gedeelde aandacht als mediator tussen geslacht en taalontwikkeling. Vervolgonderzoek met een grotere steekproef is nodig om dit aan te tonen"
Passief gebruik van sociale media en het zelfvertrouwen: De rol van sociale vergelijking,"['Joustra, Tommy']","['Henricks, L.A.']",2023-10-20T00:00:50Z,NL,[],"Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Samenvatting
De laatste jaren blijkt het passief gebruik van sociale media steeds verder gestegen en lijkt dit
negatieve gevolgen te hebben voor het zelfvertrouwen onder jongeren. Onder sociale media
worden sites als Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat en TikTok verstaan (ook wel sociale
netwerksites; SNS). Het doel van dit onderzoek was om het verband tussen passief SNSgebruik
en het zelfvertrouwen te bekijken om te onderzoeken of dit verband wordt
gemedieerd door opwaartse sociale vergelijking (vergelijken van zichzelf met anderen die
volgens hen meer waard zijn). In totaal hebben er 70 adolescenten tussen de 16 en 18 jaar
meegedaan aan het onderzoek. Zij hebben online vragenlijsten ingevuld via Qualtrics (een
aangepaste versie van de Multidimensional Scale of Facebook Use, de Rosenberg Self-
Esteem Scale en de opwaartse sociale vergelijkingsvragenlijst). Om het mediatie effect van de
opwaartse vergelijking te bepalen is er gebruik gemaakt van de PROCESS-macro. Uit de
resultaten blijkt dat er sprake is van een direct negatief verband tussen ‘passief SNS-gebruik’
en het ‘zelfvertrouwen’ onder jongeren. Wanneer er wordt gecontroleerd op de mediator
‘opwaartse vergelijking’ blijkt dat er sprake is van een volledige mediatie. Meer passief SNSgebruik
hangt dus samen met meer opwaartse vergelijking, maar meer opwaartse vergelijking
met een lager zelfvertrouwen onder jongeren. Beperkingen en aanbevelingen voor
vervolgonderzoek staan in het huidige onderzoek beschreven."

Understanding the pathways and fate of microplastics in this region is crucial, as the nearshore zone is considered to be a hotspot that accumulates microplastics. The motion of microplastic particles is determined by incoming waves, currents, dispersive processes related to turbulence, and the settling velocity of the particles. To investigate the fate of floating and sinking microplastics– specifically, whether they beach, get trapped in the nearshore zone, or escape towards the open ocean– a 3D wave-averaged Lagrangian Particle Tracking Model (LPTM) is developed and employed. It was found that majority of floating microplastics released offshore eventually beach. The remaining particles stay trapped in rip circulation cells. In contrast, sinking particles released offshore tend to escape towards the open ocean. Those that manage to enter the surf zone, reside therein with only a small fraction of particles beaching. When sinking particles are released close to the shoreline, a small percentage of them is able to escape towards the surf zone and further into the open ocean. In the shoaling zone, the linear component of the Stokes drift velocity moves floating particles towards the surf zone, where they get trapped in the rip circulation. Close to the shoreline, components of the Stokes drift velocity cause microplastics to beach. Sinking particles are addtionally subject to the undertow that moves them offshore, which results in less beaching. The relative importance of processes that drive particle motion depends on the environmental conditions, such as the wave height, wave period, wave angle of incidence, but also the bathymetry and buoyancy of microplastics themselves. Results of this study are ultimately useful to improve parametrizations of"

Agroecology in Practice: Designing a Food Forest in the Utrechtse Heuvelrug,"['Winckler, Pia']","['Dermody, Brian']",2023-11-02T00:01:14Z,EN,['food forest; agroecology; transdisciplinarity'],Sustainable Development,"This thesis explores sustainable design principles for a climate-adaptive food forest (FF) at estate Zuylestein in the Utrechtse Heuvelrug. The landowner wished to integratea former forested area into the productional focus of the entire estate while restoring the look of a forest as required by national monument legislation and adapting to climate change. FFs represent an agroecological, sustainable way of producing food while benefitting the local community and nature. It can thus be seen to in crease food sovereignty. For this purpose, the estate needed to be evaluated from a social-ecological system (SES) perspective to reveal constraints, opportunities, and goals for the FF. Further, benefits, services and income opportunities of FFs needed investigation. Lastly, the vision and priorities of the main stakeholders needed to be considered. Scientifically, this thesis systematically assessesgeneral design principles for FFs in temperate regions, with a focus on climate adaptation. Further, the ap proach of the thesis being transdisciplinary with a social-ecological lens, adds to literature on transdis ciplinary projects. In this thesis, transdisciplinary work means the co-production of knowledge with the main stake holders as well as consultations with FF practitioners. Soil analyses were conducted to evaluate soil fertility and water availability. Interviews with the landowner completed the necessary social ecological knowledge on the system. What the target state of the FF should be and how a transforma tion could be facilitated was further informed by conducting a scenario and backcasting workshop with the main stakeholders. Reviewing scientific and grey literature completed the picture. By applying these methods, in an iterative process, design principles were derived. Most importantly, sufficient startup funds for the beginning years, when the system is still vulnerable need to be secured. Further, to establish resilience, effort should be put into increasing soil health by increasing the pH level and water availability through increasing the soil organic matter content. During the maturing of the FF the income streams need to be flexible as different produce can be grown at different succes sion stageswhilethe design of the FF becomes visible. To avoid disturbing the FF, most of it should not be publicly accessible. To gain revenue from food production, the layout should not be too complex to enable easy management and harvesting. These principles can be applied to sites with similar condi tions. To ensure sustainability, the local social-ecological context should always be evaluated with care and transdisciplinary collaborations fosteredto ensure context-specific results."

Echter zit er een verschil tussen de jongeren die hulp nodig hebben voor hun mentale gezondheids- problemen en jongeren die ook daadwerkelijk mentale hulp hebben ontvangen. Dit staat ook wel bekend als de onvervulde zorgbehoefte. Literatuur toont aan dat cultureel- en sociaal kapitaal invloed hebben op het al dan niet vervullen van deze zorgbehoefte onder jongeren met mentale gezondheidsproblemen. Het doel van dit onderzoek is te verklaren in hoeverre cultureel kapitaal invloed heeft op het hebben van een onvervulde zorgbehoefte onder jongeren met mentale gezondheidsproblemen van 18 tot en met 25 jaar, en welke relatie sociaal kapitaal hierin speelt. Hierdoor kan bepaald worden waarop geïntervenieerd zou kunnen worden om ervoor te zorgen dat jongeren die hulp nodig hebben voor hun mentale gezondheidsproblemen deze hulp ook zoeken en krijgen. Aan de hand van een multivariabele logistische regressie inclusief het testen van eenzaamheid als moderator is gevonden dat de relatie tussen cultureel kapitaal en het hebben van een onvervulde zorgbehoefte onder jongeren met mentale gezondheidsklachten anders is voor jongeren met verschillende niveaus van eenzaamheid, welke gedefinieerd werd als een vorm van sociaal kapitaal. Tevens blijkt dat jongeren die aangeven sterk eenzaam te zijn een significant hogere kans hebben op het hebben van een onvervulde zorgbehoefte bij mentale gezondheids-klachten. Beleid zal daarom gefocust moeten zijn op laagdrempelige toegang tot mentale gezondheidszorg en het doorbreken van het taboe over gevoelens van eenzaamheid. Op deze manier kunnen jongeren worden voorzien in het hebben van een vervulde zorgbehoefte."

Abstract
Climate education is a part of geography lessons. What exactly is taught and the way it is taught
depends on the orientation of the teacher. Orientations can be classified based on learning goals,
purposes and underlying convictions of the teacher. One teacher might want to teach about the
physical processes of climate change, while another wants students to be able to deal with the
consequences of climate change. A quantitative instrument to determine the ratio of orientations of
geography teachers concerning climate has not been developed yet. This study shows how such a
quantitative measuring instrument can be formed. Based on already executed qualitative research,
variables of ten orientations have been converted to survey questions with which the ratio of
orientations has been established. The one dimensional and two dimensional questions based on
those variables give the opportunity to create a short survey for a large quantitative study."

a scientific, strategic management and business context. Plagued by their intangibility and
abstract nature, canvases pose a unique challenge to their users in terms of definition and
comprehension. The core objective of this research is to answer the central question: ”What
actually is a canvas?” To this end, the paper seeks to establish a robust definition of a canvas
through comprehensive research and analysis.
The research process starts with a broad literature review, followed by an extensive survey
of existing types of canvases to lay a solid foundation for further analysis. Existing definitions
for each canvas type are gathered and compared, with a specific focus on finding commonali-
ties that can contribute to a holistic definition. The structure and characteristics of canvases
are meticulously broken down, analyzed and presented to understand their key components.
Simultaneously, the academic status of canvases is investigated, highlighting how they are
referenced, utilized, and treated within scientific discourse. Existing and potential evaluation
methods for canvases are studied to better understand their current uses, and to shed light
on their inherent qualities and effectiveness. Lastly, the research focuses on identifying the
typical users and creators of canvases, aiming to gain insight into the contexts of use and

Comparison of two-stage stochastic optimization and adaptive robust optimization for European day-ahead electricity market clearing.,"['Loo, Joran van der']","['Fumagalli, Elena']",2023-11-02T01:01:09Z,EN,['Market clearing; Electricity networks; Robust optimization; Stochastic optimization; Wind uncertainty'],Energy Science,"The current deterministic day ahead market clearing in wholesale electricity markets, which was constructed around dispatchable and controllable electricity from conventional producers, is in need of adaptation to address the increased uncertainty resulting from the integration of variable renewable energy sources. Through their stochastic nature, variable renewable energy sources are non-dispatchable and output cannot be controlled, potentially resulting in grid imbalances in cases of forecast errors. Two-stage stochastic optimization and Adaptive Robust optimization utilizing the Column-and-Constraint generation algorithm are proposed for the day ahead market clearing in a case study on the Dutch, French and German wholesale electricity markets. A framework of performance indicators is constructed to evaluate- and compare the models on their ability to maximize the social economic welfare, increase system security of supply and integrate variable renewable energy sources in the energy mix. The results of the case studies indicate an increased social economic welfare through improved system security by the proposed models, drastically reducing the occurrence of load shedding events. The stochastic model outperforms the robust formulation during the in-sample scenarios, however proving vulnerable to unexpected stochastic output realizations during the out-of-sample scenarios. The Robust model, showing the highest degree of system security of supply because of its conservative nature, significantly decreases the integration of variable renewable energy sources in the energy mix while requiring the highest amount of upward reserve capacity. Both proposed models indicate a need for increasing the upward reserve capacity in energy systems with high penetration of variable renewable energy sources, while decreasing the utilization of installed stochastic producer capacity. Results of the sensitivity analyses indicate an increased system security to unexpected output realizations of the stochastic model by increasing the in-sample size, although increasingly extended computational time was observed for solving the problem. The sensitivity analysis on the budget of uncertainty of the robust model showed a direct trade-off between integration of variable renewable energy sources and system security of supply, while a relationship between the distribution of installed stochastic producer capacity among the stochastic producers and the budget of uncertainty revealed potential market inequalities in real-world applications of this formulation."
Spatial Storytelling in Yad Vashem: An Ethnographic Exploration on the (Dis)Placement of the Sacred in Israel's National Holocaust Memorial,"['Dijkstra, Wytze']","['Tamimi Arab, P.']",2023-11-02T00:01:17Z,EN,['Holocaust memory; reflexivity; ritualization; spatial storytelling; Yad Vashem'],Religious Studies,"[""""This thesis traces the interface of Holocaust memory and religious text, symbolism, and motifs at 
Yad Vashem, Israels official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. Working with the notion
of spatial storytelling, I analyze how religion is infused into the commemorative practices of Yad 
Vashem, and how this is spatialized on the memorial’s grounds. Taking ‘storytelling’ as the 
primary methodological concept for my ethnographic engagement with Yad Vashem, this thesis 
explores issues of reflexivity through putting researcher-researched dialectics center stage. 
Through spatial analysis and by following the body’s course through Yad Vashem, I suggest how 
mentalism and materialism can be thought off conjointly in walking over Yad Vashem’s grounds 
and in engaging with changing understanding of trauma in Israel and its visual repercussions on 
the landscape of Yad Vashem. The thesis ultimately argues that the nature and location of religion 
at Yad Vashem can be understood in terms of transferable biblical quality onto Yad Vashem’s 
grounds. Through sacred reference and ritualized practice, Yad Vashem cloaks the memory of 
the Holocaust in a biblical garb, begging the question whether the stories of the Holocaust 
themselves are not stories of a new Bible. The analysis necessitates a reflexive turn inwards that 
further denaturalizes the concept of ‘religion’ itself. Through taking serious (dis)placeable biblical 
quality and pointing to a biblical idea, the thesis points to the interconnections of memory,
religion, and sacrality, whilst simultaneously questioning the effect of the sacred status for 
Holocaust memory itself.""""]"

RELATIVISTIC ATOM IONIZATION
CROSS SECTION BY ELECTRON IMPACT","['Brudanin, Valerii']","['Gursoy, U']",2023-11-02T00:00:59Z,EN,"['Theroretical spectroscopy, atomic cross section,  electron energy loss spectroscopy, relativistic quantum mechanics, Dirac-Hartree-Fock']",Theoretical Physics,"The elemental composition of materials in the Transmission Electron Microscope is
probed by inner shell ionization of atoms by a high energetic electron beam. Proper elemental quantification of the material requires detailed knowledge of the electron-atom differential ionization cross section (DCS). In the current work, the cross section is calculated in
the context of relativistic quantum mechanics. Relativistic effects become important due to
the high energy of the electron beam. The atomic dynamics is calculated in a fully relativistic setting, using Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) solutions for the atomic bound and continuum
wavefunctions. The relaxation of the atom due to the ionization by the beam needs to be
taken into account. To address this, a continuum wave is computed in a self-consistent field
of an ion. Non-orthogonality between atomic and ionic wavefunctions leads to additional
corrections. They are shown to be important at low energy of the ionized electron which is
particularly interesting for materials with elements which have close ionization energies"
De veranderende maatschappelijke rol van sportclubs: bij wie ligt de bal? Een case study naar de besluitvorming rondom de aanleg van een kunstgrasveld bij een voetbalclub in een wijk met een lage sociaal-economische status,"['Groot, Jelle de']","['Bottenburg, Maarten van']",2023-10-02T00:00:46Z,NL,[],Sports Policy and Sports Management,"Deze masterthesis gaat over de veranderende maatschappelijke rol van sportverenigingen in wijken met een lage sociaal-economische status.
Het is een casestudy naar de besluitvorming over de aanleg van een kunstgrasveld bij voetbalvereniging SVO De Dreef in Overvecht, een Utrechtse wijk met een lage sociaal-economische status.
De afgelopen jaren is de vereniging niet in aanmerking gekomen voor subsidie door de afdeling Sport van de gemeente Utrecht, omdat de afdeling Sport bij de toekenning van subsidies voor sportfaciliteiten een rekenkader gebruikt dat zich beperkt tot het aantal actieve leden die aangesloten zijn bij de sportbond.
Dit rekenkader houdt geen rekening met andere aspecten, zoals de bijdrage van sportclubs aan maatschappelijke vraagstukken.
De afgelopen jaren hebben SVO De Dreef en een aantal stakeholders geprobeerd om andere financieringsmogelijkheden in kaart te brengen, maar het is tot op heden niet gelukt om de business case rond te krijgen.
De besluitvorming over de aanleg van het kunstgrasveld is daardoor in een impasse beland.
De volgende onderzoeksvraag staat in dit onderzoek centraal: Wat zijn volgens de betrokken organisaties de oorzaken van de impasse in de besluitvorming over de omzetting van een grasveld naar een kunstgrasveld op het sportcomplex van SVO De Dreef en hoe kan deze impasse worden doorbroken?
Er is aan de hand van semi-gestructureerde interviews onderzocht hoe de stakeholders die direct betrokken zijn bij de impasse deze impasse formuleren en hoe zij denken dat de impasse kan worden opgelost.
Daarnaast is de effectiviteit van deze kerngroep geobserveerd en zijn verschillende documenten geanalyseerd die bijgedragen hebben aan de kennisvorming over de impasse.
Aan de hand van deze theorieën is de governancevorm van de kerngroep bepaald en is onderzocht met welke inhoudelijke, institutionele en strategische complexiteiten de stakeholders te maken hebben en hoe deze ondervangen kunnen worden.
Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de beperking van het rekenkader van de afdeling Sport tot puur sportspecifieke eisen door de kerngroep als belangrijkste inhoudelijke oorzaak van de impasse wordt gezien.
De kerngroep rond SVO De Dreef wil dit niet afwachten en richt zich voor de tussenliggende jaren daarom op andere vormen van financiering.
Het organiseren van dit traject vraagt, mede door de verschillende institutionele achtergronden van de betrokken organisaties, om meer regie dan het losse werkverband dat de kerngroep tot voor kort met elkaar vormde.
Om de impasse te doorbreken is het daarom ook van belang om de governancevorm van de kerngroep te veranderen.
Dat lukt alleen als de financiering van het kunstgrasveld niet zozeer als een sportgerelateerd vraagstuk wordt gezien, maar vooral als een maatschappelijk vraagstuk.
Daarnaast dienen ook andere complexiteiten ondervangen te worden om de effectiviteit van de kerngroep te vergroten.
Door de governancevorm aan te passen en het vraagstuk te reframen, kan een beroep worden gedaan op het college van burgemeester en wethouders en de gemeenteraad om alsnog in te stemmen met financiering van het kunstgrasveld op korte termijn en op lange termijn om het rekenkader van de afdeling Sport aan te passen.
De bal voor het doorbreken van de impasse ligt dus in eerste instantie bij de kerngroep om de regie te nemen op het in gang zetten van een politiek-bestuurlijk proces.
Daarna ligt de bal bij het college van burgemeester en wethouders en de gemeenteraad om de maatschappelijke rol van sportverenigingen te honoreren en mee te laten wegen in subsidie-eisen."
"Introduced grazing in Western-European coastal dune systems:
a review of the effects on flora and fauna","['Nugteren, Annika']","['Verweij, Pita']",2023-10-10T00:00:40Z,EN,['coastal dunes; introduced grazing; species richness; biodiversity'],Environmental Biology,"Western European coastal dunes are vulnerable ecosystems that are at risk of losing valuable biodiversity due to a decrease in dune dynamics and an increase in vegetation encroachment. This poses a threat to the flora and fauna of Natura 2000 priority habitat types related to open, dynamic coastal dune systems. Introduced grazing with animals such as horses, cattle, and sheep is used to reduce encroachment, with their effect depending on the used grazing regime, grazing pressure, and species assemblage. To assess the impact of introduced grazing on Western-European coastal dune systems, a literature review is conducted. This review assesses the impacts of grazing on flora and fauna in coastal dune systems in Western Europe, including areas managed by PWN in the Netherlands. The objective was to determine whether the effect of grazing in Western-European coastal dune systems is similar to that observed in PWN-managed areas. Results of this literature review shows that the effects of introduced herbivores on flora and fauna are complex and context specific. However, grazing has overall been found to enhance plant diversity and reduce the abundance of species linked to encroachment while promoting the growth of herbaceous indicator species linked to the conservation of that specific habitat. The impact on vegetation structure differs across studies, but in most cases grazing increases the openness and reduces shrub cover. Grazing has a neutral or positive effect on butterfly richness and abundance, but the impact on other invertebrates depends on their habitats and requires more monitoring to be concluded upon. Extensive grazing has a mixed effect on breeding birds, depending on the preferred habitat of the bird species. The findings from studies conducted both inside and outside of PWN areas suggest that the impacts of grazing are varied. Local context and external factors strongly influence the impact of grazing. Environmental factors may have a greater impact on flora and fauna than introduced grazers. Due to the difficulty in generalizing results across different systems, a better understanding of the interactions between grazing, habitat, and external processes is crucial for the effective management and conservation of coastal dune ecosystems."
Contingent value rights on the rise in life sciences and healthcare M&A,"['Dorp, Renée van']","['Bhaskarabhatla, Rajani Singh']",2023-10-09T23:01:19Z,EN,['CVR; M&A; Life sciences'],Science and Business Management,"Background | Financial advisers in the field of life sciences and healthcare M&A observed an apparent upward trend in the use of a unique form of payment called Contingent Value Right (CVR). In the context of public Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A), CVRs are contractual agreements in which the buyer commits to paying an additional consideration to the seller when specific payment triggers are met. Upon further research, multiple sources either confirmed or anticipated the increase in the use of CVRs, particularly within the life sciences and healthcare industry in the United States (Golden & Hanks, 2023; KPMG, 2023; Miller, 2023; Wagner Partin et al., 2023). Over the past decade, the average number of M&A transactions including a CVR, across all industries, was roughly 6 per year. However, in the first months of 2023 alone, the life sciences sector witnessed at least four public acquisitions with a CVR as part of the deal structure (AstraZeneca, 2023; Becker, 2023; Ipsen, 2023; Satsuma Pharmaceuticals, 2023). Interestingly, this trend appears to be quite notable in the United States while being completely absent in Europe.

Research questions | In this research, the primary objective was to address the knowledge gaps related to the apparent upward trend CVRs in biopharma deal structures. We aimed to uncover underlying reasons driving this trend and to discern the factors contributing to their frequent use in the United States compared to Europe. Furthermore, we set out to identify the specific situations in which CVRs prove to be particularly valuable. Our ultimate goal was to gather insights and formulate recommendations for the financial advisers at Van Lanschot Kempen.

Relevance | Knowledge of emerging instruments such as CVRs is essential for staying competitive in the highly specialized field of financial advisory. More specifically, clients in the life sciences and healthcare sector look for advisors with both financial expertise and industry-specific knowledge. In the end, this report will assist financial advisers at Van Lanschot Kempen in providing ‘personal’, ‘specialized’, and ‘entrepreneurial’ solutions to their clients, in line with three of their four core values. 

Methods | This study used literature research and expert interviews to gain insights into the trends shaping the use of CVRs in the broader biopharma M&A industry. In addition, a case study of the Lilly-Sigilon acquisition (June 29, 2023) was carried out (Eli Lilly & Company, 2023a). The reason to include a CVR in the deal structure is shaped by a variety of factors that may not always be readily apparent. Therefore, these factors should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. By using this combination of research methods, we managed to obtain insights into the use of CVRs at both the industry level and the company level.

Conclusion & recommendations | Based on our research, we have strong indications that the use of CVRs in biopharma deal structures will continue to increase. Moreover, once a legal precedent is set, we foresee that this trend will expand into Europe. We identified four reasons for a biopharma companies to include a CVR in their deal structure, namely to bridge a valuation gap, to mitigate risk, to sweeten the deal, or due to lack of alternative options. We recommend financial advisers to educate themselves on the structure and valuation of CVRs, two of the most complicated aspects of this instrument, and to engage legal professionals who understand the structure and applicability of CVRs in the European context."
No brain no gain: single-cell RNA sequencing in the study of brain tissue,"['López-Amo Calvo, Beatriz']","['Ruigrok, Ynte']",2023-10-09T23:01:30Z,EN,['scRNA-seq; brain models; neurodevelopment; single-cell omics; in vitro'],Regenerative Medicine and Technology,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is applied in molecular biology to quantify and analyze gene expression of individual cells present in a tissue sample. During the last 14 years, the technology underwent an exponential evolution towards automation and high- throughput. Current platforms enable the simultaneous analysis of hundreds of thousands of cells, requiring large computational power to analyze the sequencing data output and increased complexity of data-processing. However, scRNA-seq contribution to tissue heterogeneity characterization outweighs its high technical demands, especially in the study of the brain. ScRNA-seq application in human samples and animal models has been reviewed several times, but no review collects the contribution of scRNA-seq technology applied to in vitro models in the study of the human brain development, aging and associated diseases. This review compiles a representative collection of publications with scRNA-seq data application in in vitro brain models. It demonstrates that scRNA-seq data alone or in combination with other single-cell omics has proven useful to validate fidelity and reproducibility of in vitro models of the human brain, as well as for the identification of novel cell types or gene expression signatures associated with neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders. Single-cell transcriptomics are still in development, but hold a great potential in future research in developmental biology and translational medicine."
Beautiful Resistance in Palestine: The Use of (Performative) Arts as a Strategy to Decolonise,"['Werkhoven, Ellen van']","['Cristiano, Fabio']",2023-10-09T23:01:05Z,EN,['Beautiful Resistance; Cultural Resistance; Art; Settler-Colonialism; Political Economy; Normalisation; Palestine; Ethnography'],Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"With the multi-faceted, complex dynamics of the Israeli Occupation of Palestine, a feasible solution seems further away than ever. Yet, all sorts of forms of resistance occur aiming to oppose the settler-colonial power structure. So does the understudied notion of beautiful resistance. It is defined as the means, and practices aiming to build peace within oneself through arts, education, and culture. This thesis explores the concept of beautiful resistance by unpacking it through three analytical categories. Central to this thesis is, therefore, the question of how practices of beautiful resistance can be understood as a strategy to decolonise Palestine. Beautiful resistance can only be sufficiently understood, once its practices are understood in the context of settler-colonialism and its political economy. Based on eight weeks of ethnographic fieldwork, practices of beautiful resistance are analysed by observing and discussing the complex dynamics between art, culture, and resistance with key agents in the field. This thesis presents a critical exploration of beautiful resistance by demonstrating 1) the inextricable relation with settler-colonialism, 2) the complex network of actors constituting the political economy in which beautiful resistance is embedded, and 3) how in this context practices of beautiful resistance result in the normalisation of the status quo, in other words, the continuation of the Occupation of the Palestinian West Bank and Gaza. The academic and practical application of the notion of beautiful resistance demands a context-specific framework adapted to the oppressive structures of settler-colonialism and its adherent political economy."

Furthermore, this study assesses whether migration background influences the relationship between PF and Qol (H3). Non-western migrants did not report significantly lower PF and QoL compared to the Dutch cohort (H1) and neither a significant difference in PF and QoL had been found (H2). The moderation analysis did not support the hypothesis that migration background influences the relationship between PF and QoL.

The Relationship Between Sexual Self-Esteem and Sexual Satisfaction in Dutch Adult Women and Men: The Mediating Role of Sexual Assertiveness,"['Mutz, Rosa']","['Brink, Femke van den']",2023-10-09T23:01:28Z,EN,['Sexual satisfaction; sexual self-esteem; sexual assertiveness'],Clinical Psychology,"Sexual satisfaction (SS) is an important aspect of people’s sexual wellbeing and has been shown to bolster relational and overall wellbeing. Yet, SS is frequently investigated from a perspective of preventing dysfunction rather than enhancing wellbeing. Positive Psychology theory posits that sexual self-esteem (SSE) may play a crucial role in forming sexually satisfying partnerships by enabling people to be sexually assertive and thus facilitate more sexually pleasurable experiences. The present study aimed at further understanding this mechanism by investigating the mediating role of sexual assertiveness (SA) in the relationship between SSE and SS in men and women. In a cross-sectional design, 303 women and 85 men from the Netherlands completed an online survey measuring SSE, SA, and SS. Analyses revealed significant positive bivariate correlations between all study variables for both men and women. Significant results of a mediation analysis showed that SA partially mediated the association between SSE and SS. A subsequent moderated mediation analysis revealed that gender did not moderate any of the associations between SSE, SA, and SS. These findings corroborate prior research into the relationships between SSE, SA, and SS and suggest that there are no meaningful gender differences regarding the examined mechanism behind SS. The results indicate SSE and SA as suitable intervention points for enhancing SS."

Isotope composition of foraminiferal tests and mollusc shells are adequate proxies as their isotope uptake for shell carbonate formation is representative for the isotopic composition of ambient water. The oxygen and carbon isotope ratios can provide information about (changes in) paleotemperature and paleosalinity. For paleosalinity, a mixing line framework with freshwater and seawater endmembers can provide insights into the temporal variability of paleosalinity. Here we show that reconstructing paleoenvironment and paleoclimate in MIS5 of the North Sea Basin with stable isotopes is taxon dependent. We found that the isotopic composition of mollusc shells largely reflects temperature of ambient waters. Furthermore, we found that the isotopic composition of foraminifera shells of Ammonia beccarii is largely influenced by salinity. Reconstruction shows a shift during MIS5e in the Amersfoort Basin from polyhaline to euhaline conditions and back with an increasing impact of the Rhine River, and a three-stage temperature evolution during MIS5a in the southern North Sea. This study is anticipated to be a starting point and recommendation for further reconstruction of paleoenvironment and -climate of MIS5 in the North Sea Basin."

The study of online violent extremists is a topic currently under-represented in academia, notably in the field of International Relations, which has historically been slow to adapt its concepts to emerging non-state actors. While a security culture describes a set of behavioral patterns that follow particular interpretations of security, being composed of groups that seek to achieve security by counteracting perceived threats, an Insecurity Culture is one constantly aware or convinced of threats while being unable or unwilling to field a solution. The field of Security Studies provides the best inroad for an IR-based study of how these internet-based far-right conspiracy communities function. These serve to demonstrate examples of radicalization, the ‘bubble’ effects of closed-off chat rooms, and the ideological convergences between different conspiracies under the QAnon umbrella."
Investigating User Experience for Local Community Platforms,"['Linden, Anna van der']","['Nimwegen, Christof van']",2023-10-24T00:00:55Z,EN,[],Human-Computer Interaction,"A strong local community is important for the well-being of its residents, and this can bring numerous benefits, both social as well as economic benefits. While this contributes to the development of a strong local community, technological advancements have allowed for the creation of community building through digital means. A local community platform is easily distributable and accessible for members of a
community and helps to build connections, enables the sharing of skills and assets, and facilitates a local currency wallet.
However, designing a community platform for everyone in a community is challenging since the platform and its interface must be accessible and understandable for all members of a community. Different users have different needs when using a local community platform, and there are specific design guidelines for different users which makes designing a platform difficult.
So, there is a need for a set of design guidelines specifically developed for local community platforms. To establish these guidelines a systematic literature review was conducted, so the guidelines were based on relevant literature; this resulted in 5 design guidelines. However, the guidelines needed to be validated by practice as well, so a case study was done using an existing local community platform called
LocalforLocal. In this case study, first a user test was done with the existing LocalforLocal platform, then the guidelines were applied to create an iterated version and the user test was conducted again. Then the results were compared to see if the guidelines had an impact on the user experience of the platform. The AttrakDiff survey showed a partially significant increase in usability and engagement, and the
System Darkness Scale showed a non-significant decrease in the darkness of the system. Furthermore, the task results and the qualitative results showed an increase in user experience.
The results from the case study showed that the guidelines had an overall positive impact on the user experience, which means that the guidelines are appropriate for designing local community platforms. Future work includes replicating the case study with other local community platforms with a more diverse sample of the population. By validating the guidelines even further they could become the norm for designing local community platforms."

In recent years, more has been uncovered as to how PD develops and is maintained. Fear generalization (FG), the tendency to respond fearfully to cues less and less like a prior learning experience, is one factor that has been associated with PD. Trait anxiety (TA) is a well-established and measured anxiety construct which has been shown to correlate with PD. This study examines TA as a moderator between FG and panic symptoms (PS). A non-clinical sample (N = 85) was exposed to a fear generalization paradigm. Both electromyographically measured fear-potentiated startle responses (EMG) and self ratings were used to record responses. After finishing the generalization paradigm, participants completed  questionnaires which measured PS and TA. Participants were divided by median along two PS measures and TA. A repeated measures analysis of variance revealed no significant interactions in the EMG responses, but did find significant three-way interactions in the self rating data. Additionally, the data indicated low responses to the conditioned danger stimulus in the risk rating data, which prevents further interpretation of the effect as a form of fear generalization. The findings shed more light on how PD could develop or maintain. Limitations of the study include the use of a non-clinical sample and a potential lack of power for finding generalization effects in such a population. The effects of using different instruments for measuring fear responses, and potential new avenues for research are discussed."

This thesis will analyze the reception of this garment, whose symbolism as a romantic symbol of Spanishness was already complex, through the analysis of the references in the historical press and any existing image of the Empress sporting it. Eugénie proved to be well aware of the power of fashion as consort, which she used together with her factual power as regent. This thesis aims to highlight the importance of her (self) representation, especially her apparel, in negotiating and defining her identity as Empress of the French and her transnational background. She was Spanish and French, Countess of Teba and Empress of France, a political figure and a fashion icon, and the complexity of her figure deserves a deeper understanding."

Ouders die zich minder competent voelen in de opvoeding maken vaker ouder-oorzakelijke attributies en maken vaker gebruik van harde disciplinering. Tot het heden zijn parental self-efficacy en ouder-oorzakelijke attributies echter altijd los van elkaar bestudeerd waardoor het onbekend is hoe deze cognities samenwerken. In dit onderzoek wordt onderzocht of ouder-oorzakelijke attributies een mediërende rol speelt in het verband tussen parental self-efficacy en harde disciplinering. Ontwerp. Moeders uit Nederland (108 moeders, Mleeftijd = 32,72) met een kind (50,9% meisjes) tussen 23 en 51 maanden (Mleeftijd = 34,88) oud namen deel aan dit onderzoek. Moeders rapporteerden over de ervaren parental self-efficacy, ouder-oorzakelijke attributies en het gebruik van harde disciplinering in de opvoeding. Resultaten. De resultaten van dit onderzoek tonen aan dat er geen sprake is van een mediërende rol van ouder-oorzakelijke attributies in het verband tussen PSE en harde disciplinering. Er worden wel significante relaties gevonden tussen alle gemeten concepten. Conclusie. Aangezien deze studie correlaties tussen alle concepten heeft gevonden, moet er meer onderzoek worden gedaan naar de aard van deze verbanden. Daarnaast zou ook meer onderzoek gedaan moeten worden naar in hoeverre de concepten parental self-efficacy en ouder-oorzakelijke attributies als aparte constructen gezien kunnen worden."
The Role of Context in Disability Intervention: Realist Evaluation of the Work and Respect Project from the Liliane Foundation,"['Loo, Kenya van de']","['Hoogenboom, Marcel']",2023-10-27T23:00:54Z,EN,"['disability, realist evaluation, disability intervention, livelihood, community-based rehabilitation']","Social Challenges, Policies and Interventions","All youth deserve the chance to take advantage of their rights. However, youth with a disability often experience poverty and socioeconomic exclusion, especially in low-income countries such as Kenya and Rwanda. The Liliane Foundation’s livelihood-centred initiative called the Work and Respect Project aims to teach youth living with a disability the skills and a trade to gain a livelihood and to make their community more understanding and inclusive of disability needs. This study used Pawson and Tilley’s (2004) Realist Evaluation to investigate how the intervention would interact with Kenya and Rwanda’s context, mechanisms, and proposed outcomes. Therefore, this study poses the following research question: Does the Work and Respect Project produce the desired outcome of livelihood improvement among youth with disability and disability inclusivity in Kenya and Rwanda? Further, do they change the existing mechanisms to do so? This study called for a content analysis of qualitative data in the form of reports, information sheets, letters, and qualitative monitoring and evaluation data collected by the LF. This thesis used a coding technique to answer the research questions. Codes were predefined and stemmed from concepts from RE, namely context, mechanisms, and outcomes. After this, the second coding round was inductive thematic coding from the first rounds of coding. The analysis used three predetermined codes and produced twelve thematic codes. Both societies exclude youth with disabilities, specifically socio-economically and educationally, primarily due to negative cultural perceptions of PWD. The activities implemented by the Work and Respect Project aimed to change these perceptions but differed specifically to fit in the context towards inclusive societies and empower the youth. After applying realist evaluation, the program theory concludes that the Work and Respect Project can change the context and influence mechanisms to create better, more inclusive societies in Kenya and Rwanda. This can be attributed to introducing disability education and sensitization training in these societies."
The Algorithmic Reimagination: exploring critical making with algorithmic tools in new media art,"['Suppaiboonsuk, Kwan']","['Lange, Michiel de']",2023-10-27T15:02:08Z,EN,['AI as creative materials; playful media culture; generative AI; algorithmic tools; affordance;reappropriation; imagination; sociotechnical imaginaries'],New Media and Digital Culture,"This study examines the creative potentials of algorithms and how AI tools may be utilized by
media artists to reappropriate them from tools of discrimination to tools of liberation. Through a
case study and a critical making assignment, key findings regarding AI affordances are
identified and related to appropriation in creative practice through the lens of play theory. AI
affordances offer a range of possibilities for creative practices, which, when creatively
appropriated, redefine the values and purposes of algorithms. The reflective capabilities of
algorithms allow for deeper reflections on societal issues, making media art a powerful platform
for addressing algorithmic bias and sparking critical discussions. Insights derived from critical
inspection of tools and creative practices are used to develop the notion of the algorithmic
reimagination. Algorithmic reimagination is a notion that embodies skills and attitudes that seek
to challenge the dominant logics of algorithms and open pathways for actions. By embracing the
spirit of play and imagination, artists can engage with algorithmic tools to provoke discussion,
while envisioning a more just and equitable future. This paper highlights the significance of the
algorithmic reimagination in shaping the narrative and impact of algorithms in contemporary
society and in paving the way for a more inclusive and ethical AI culture from the domain of

Risk factors and outcomes of NEC in preterm and low birth weight infants with a congenital heart defect,"['Chin On, Sergei']","['Nijman, Joppe']",2023-10-27T00:00:39Z,EN,"['NEC, Necrotizing enterocolitis, Preterm and low birth weight infants with a congenital heart disease.']",Selective Utrecht Medical Master (SUMMA),"In this study population of 64 preterm and LBW infants with CHD, the incidence of NEC was substantially
higher than the general population. This incidence coincides with the experience that prematurity, LBW
and CHD increase the risk for NEC up to 100- fold. This study population exclusively consisted of
vulnerable preterm infants under 35 weeks of GA which explains the high incidence of NEC in this
population.
The predisposing conditions for NEC in this population of preterm and LBW infants with CHD were
invasive ventilation, received CPR and sepsis preoperatively, and duration of 1st invasive ventilation, PHT
and iNO treatment postoperatively. Factors with noticeable difference between the NEC and no-NEC
group were gestational age, birth weight, type of feeding and surgical characteristics. These results
should be carefully interpreted due to lack of power.
As expected, NEC significantly increased the risk of mortality in the infants of this study population, the
deaths directly or indirectly attributed to NEC or its complications.
This study ads to the understanding of the ambiguity of many different variables. The results of this
study will hopefully support future risk factor studies, act as a basis for prospective and multicenter
studies and will hopefully add to future preventive strategies."
Traditional Augmentation Versus Deep Generative Diffusion Augmentation for Addressing Class Imbalance in Chest X-ray Classification,"['Lan, Xinhao Lan']","['Salah, Albert']",2023-10-26T23:01:36Z,EN,[],Artificial Intelligence,"Medical image analysis has advanced rapidly with the integration of deep learning techniques. However, the challenge of unbalanced datasets and the need for effective pre-processing methods remain significant difficulties in achieving optimal classification performance. This thesis aims to investigate the effectiveness of various image dataset augmentation techniques and the potential of diffusion models for chest x-ray image classification, focusing mainly on the data unbalance problem.

After obtaining a high quality dataset using various data and image preprocessing methods,
we used traditional data augmentation methods such as rotation, flipping, blurring, and
contrast modification to increase the number of positive class samples. In addition to
traditional augmentation methods, several diffusion models are introduced to synthesize
new chest x-ray images to further strengthen the minority class and address data imbalance. The performance of these methods was evaluated using specific metrics and compared to established baseline models.

The results showed that while replacing labels and masking images can introduce errors, the selected combination of preprocessing methods showed promise in improving classification performance. These results also indicated that traditional data augmentation methods, after careful fine-tuning of the hyperparameters, achieved significant performance improvements over the original baseline model. The application of diffusion models further improves the final classification results. Moreover, the images generated by the diffusion models, compared to traditional augmentation methods, do not merely modify the original images, but introduce some new image information, leading to improvements in various metrics.
Our results demonstrate the importance of augmentation methods in addressing data imbalance and improving the results of chest X-ray image classification. The research describes the most important image generation techniques that yield superior classification results while overcoming the hurdles of imbalanced datasets. These findings have profound implications for the medical field and machine learning specialists, signaling a promising path for improving diagnostic accuracy and patient care in chest X-ray image analysis. While current methods show potential, further research, particularly in the areas of stable diffusion models and deep learning-based image classification, is needed to make significant
advances in the field."
Identity (re)constructing of (ex)recurrent homeless individuals,"['Palm, Mette']","['Gigengack, R.A.']",2023-10-27T23:01:01Z,EN,"['Recurrent homelessness, role-exit, identity, stigma']","Social Challenges, Policies and Interventions","Exiting homelessness is not only about transitioning to housing, but also about dealing with a precarious stigmatized social identity and regaining self-worth. This case-study explored how (ex)recurrent homeless individuals in Utrecht understood their identity and used identity work through the process of role-exit to (re)construct their identity. The concept of the performative Self (Goffman (1963), the process of role-exit (Ebaugh, 1986) and theory on identity work served as theoretical lens. By means of narrative analysis, yearly interviews of four (ex)recurrent homeless participants were analyzed of the period 2019-2023. Two key themes emerged, reflecting ‘identity work in daily life engagements’ and ‘identity work in engagements with institutions’. With regard to first, findings revealed that 1) participants understood themselves as being able to exit the ‘homeless’ role, allowing them to transcend associated self-representations, 2) they socially distanced themselves from other (ex)homeless individuals to avoid stigmatization, 3) previous mannerisms became redundant or hindering and remnants of the former role where incorporated into their new identities, and 4) participants used status mobilization as a form of impression management to profile and protect their identities. Regarding the latter, it was found that 1) participants felt excluded from society and believed they were only helped by institutions if that was monetarily valuable, 2) they refused help from care facilities as an act of resistance to protect their self-respect, 3) participants creatively used the dependent perception that caregivers held of them to achieve their ends, and 4) when accepting help, participants downplayed the hierarchy and power imbalance between themselves and the caregivers. Overall, this study highlights that the process of role-exit and identity (re)construction should not merely be understood as a process of the (ex)homeless individuals, but also of the non-homeless people because they keep the homeless individuals from changing or transitioning their positions."

This study aimed to build upon this work by also investigating the interaction between feedback reference frames and an achievement goal orientation’s valance, i.e., approach or avoidance, and emphasising the need for progress indicators that are individualised to one’s achievement goal orientation. To this end, we created and evaluated four alternative dashboard designs of an existing learning analytics dashboard to cater to each achievement goal orientation in the framework by Elliot and McGregor. Results show limited significant effects in the evaluation scores by performance-approach and mastery-approach-oriented students to an upward social feedback reference frame and an absolute achievement feedback ref­erence frame, respectively. No effects were found for the achievement goals of negative valance. Considering methodological limitations and sample size, the findings indicate that while the con­ceptual distinction between approach and avoidance achievement goals is solid, understanding its implications in the design of learning analytics dashboards may prove difficult. It is important to understand and address these nuances in order to accommodate every learner effectively."
“Let’s break it into smaller steps”: the possible role of social workers in improving the access of vulnerable smokers to smoking cessation support.,"['Smit, Isabel']","['Kamphuis, Carlijn']",2023-10-27T23:01:03Z,EN,[],"Social Challenges, Policies and Interventions","Background: Smokers with a lower socioeconomic status or migration background experience multiple barriers to accessing smoking cessation support. Previous studies suggest that social workers could play a significant role in reducing these barriers. The aim of this study is to explore what role(s) social workers can play in improving access to smoking cessation support and their readiness to fulfill these roles. 
Methods: In 2022 and 2023, semi-structured interviews as well as participatory learning and action sessions were conducted in the Netherlands amongst smokers with a lower SES or a migration background, smoking cessation support providers, social workers and external experts in multiple living labs, in the Netherlands. Interviews were coded using a combination of deductive and inductive coding; data were analyzed thematically.
Results: Important barriers for accessing smoking cessation support as reported by interview participants included difficulties in perceiving, seeking, reaching and engaging with the support, as well as concerns related to the appropriateness, approachability, intensity and affordability of smoking cessation support. To overcome these barriers social workers could motivate this group of smokers to quit smoking, proactively refer them to smoking cessation support and provide individual or group support. Social workers feel capable of addressing smoking cessation but lack organizational support, hindering their motivation to discuss it. When social workers feel capable, have the opportunity and motivation to fulfill these roles, this does not necessarily lead to performing this behavior.
Conclusion: Participants agree on multiple roles social workers could fulfill to reduce the barriers smokers with a lower SES or migration background experience in accessing smoking cessation support. To fulfill these roles, it is recommended to gradually integrate cessation support into their daily responsibilities through the provision of concrete and small practical assignments, allowing social workers’ capabilities, opportunities and motivation regarding the uptake of these roles to increase."
"Understanding the Relation between Frequency of Technology Usage on Work life Balance: The Role of Age, Occupation and Education","['Princen, Jette']","['Berkel, J. van']",2023-10-27T23:01:05Z,EN,[],"Social Challenges, Policies and Interventions","Background: Technology, such as computers, laptops and tablets, negatively affects work-life balance due to work and non-work conflicts an individual experiences. This directly affects an individual’s well-being and quality of life, as they experience conflicts between roles within work and non-work domains and challenges in setting boundaries. This study aims to investigate whether the frequency of technology use of computers, laptops and tablets in work is associated with work-life balance. This study explores work-life balance and technology use further by using the Ideal Worker Norm, Role Conflict Theory and Boundary Theory and investigates whether there are differences in the association between workers of different ages, occupations and educational backgrounds. 
Methods: A quantitative analysis of secondary cross-sectional data was conducted. The data came from the OECD 2020 Risks that Matter Survey and was collected from over 25.000 respondents across 25 countries. The study focused on working Dutch respondents (N=951) and was analyzed using Pearson’s Partial Correlation and Hierarchical Regression Analyses via IBM SPSS Statistics v28. 
Results: The results were threefold. First, they revealed a positive association between work-life balance and frequency of technology use r(949)=.090,p<.05. Second, they revealed a positive correlation for moderator age for workers under the age of 45 and work-life balance (b=.319,p<.001). Third, the results showed no statistically significant correlation for moderator's occupation (b=.218,p=.520) and education (b= -.008,p=.945).
Conclusion: This study confirms that work-life balance is associated with frequency of technology use of computers, laptops and tablets and that this is moderated by age. Future research is recommended to deepen the understanding of this relationship and assert causality."

Unraveling the mysteries of the growth plate; An approach in modeling and mapping the process of endochondral ossification without the need for animal sacrifice,"['Otter, kyra']","['Teunissen, Michelle']",2023-11-09T00:01:03Z,EN,['Growth plate; epiphyseal growth plate; development; in vitro; three-dimensional; model; 3D; endochondral ossification; bone formation; ATDC5; progenitor; stem cells; chondrocytes; culture; surface markers;'],Regenerative Medicine and Technology,"The musculoskeletal system, fundamental to mobility, is reliant on the intricate organisation of the musculoskeletal tissues including bones, cartilage, tendons, and muscles. The foundation of these tissues is laid during embryonic development through two distinct mechanisms, endochondral and intramembranous ossification. The former entails the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into chondrocytes, forming a cartilaginous template that matures into bone. The epiphyseal growth plate, a structure at the end of long bones, regulates longitudinal bone growth through chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and ultimately, apoptosis or trans differentiation into osteoblasts. This process separates the growth plate in distinct zones: resting, proliferative, and hypertrophic, each with unique cellular characteristics and matrix composition.

Trauma induced large bone defects that the body itself is unable to repair highlight the need for new treatment strategies. Current strategies to treat large bone defects include grafts. However this approach encounters limitations, which shows the need to explore novel bone regeneration strategies. Studying endochondral ossification, particularly intriguing due to its hypoxia-tolerant nature, presents such a promising strategy. However, this requires a comprehensive understanding of endochondral ossification, a gap that studying the epiphyseal growth plate can help fill.

Animal models are indispensable tools used for growth plate research, even though challenges arise in direct translation of the findings in these models to humans. In vitro models provide controllability, allowing manipulation and large-scale analysis to study endochondral ossification more extensively. Additionally, they have the potential to replace animal models according to 3Rs principle. The ATDC5 cell line is an excellent candidate to model endochondral ossification due to its chondrogenic differentiation potential and easy accessibility and maintenance. Nonetheless, a cell line is limited. The use of primary growth plate cells from larger and more representative animals can enhance the modelling for a better translation to the human process of endochondral ossification.
This thesis outlines a comprehensive approach to investigate growth plate biology and endochondral ossification. A 3D in vitro growth plate model is developed using chondrogenic ATDC5 cells to simulate chondrogenic maturation. Subsequently, primary growth plate cells from dogs and pigs are isolated to elevate the model and explore surface markers for identifying resting zone progenitors. Promising markers are identified, which lays a foundation for future research in progenitor cell isolation.

Results demonstrate successful induction of chondrogenic maturation and differentiation in ATDC5 cells and establishment of a 3D model utilizing primary dog growth plate cells. Potential markers, CD146, CD105, CD90, CD44, CD73, and CD271, for identifying progenitor cells are validated for presence and expression in the resting zone. This work provides the foundation for advanced in vitro models, offering insights into endochondral ossification and potential applications in growth disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, and regenerative therapies. As the journey continues, these findings promise to enhance our comprehension of bone formation and contribute to improving global health and well-being."
Quantifying fluoroquinolone resistance-inducing point mutations from metagenomics data,"['Cernat, Simona']","['Zomer, Aldert']",2023-11-09T00:01:09Z,EN,['tool; bioinformatics; resistance; fluoroquinolone;'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones primary arises from chromosomal point mutations in the gyrA and parC genes. Currently, bioinformatics tools designed for measuring resistance from metagenomics data are not able to detect resistance arising from point mutations. To address this gap, two methods for quantifying fluoroquinolone resistance-inducing SNPs from metagenomic reads were created.GyrAPointCounter is a software which can analyze the presence and abundance of point mutations present on gyrA that cause resistance and infer the relative proportion of reads carrying potential resistance causing sequences vs wildtype sequences. Additionally, we developed a classification tree machine learning model, which was trained using the physicochemical proprieties of amino acids. Both methods form their decision rules by using the available sequences and the mutational patterns of fluoroquinolone-resistant GyrAs present in the CARD database.
The two methods were validated using an Escherichia coli (E. coli) WGS dataset (n = 201) and an external dataset comprised of gyrA sequences (n = 40) belonging to species distinct from those present in the training data. The results of the analyses show that both methods display excellent concordance with the phenotypic data for E. coli sequences. The classification performance for novel species for GyrAPointCounter and the supervised learning model showed a True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.87 and 1 and True Negative Rate (TNR) of 0.75 and 0.68 respectively. An in-house shotgun time series metagenomomics datatset containing Illumina short-reads from farm animals treated with enrofloxacin was submitted for the analysis with our two methods. The enrofloxacin-treated samples displayed higher average resistance levels compared to the control groups for both methods. Conclusions: This research introduced the first version of GyrAPointCounter, which is a promising
tool for monitoring the resistance levels from metagenomics data. However, stricter validation is needed before confidently evaluating the tool’s performance. For the current version, we propose using the tool as a relative quantification method, rather than absolute."
COVID-19 Infection and Psychosocial Symptoms in First Year Post-Stroke Patients,"['Langeweg, Jaël']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-11-09T00:00:54Z,EN,['stroke; COVID-19; depression; anxiety; fatigue; rehabilitation'],Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Annually 12.2 million adults worldwide suffer a stroke, this can result in physical and psychosocial issues like depression, anxiety, and fatigue. These symptoms are very similar to those in individuals from the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychosocial symptoms are known to have a negative impact on the recovery of stroke survivors. However, little is known about the impact of a COVID infection post-stroke on psychosocial outcomes. 

Aim: This study aimed to investigate a relationship between COVID-19 infection and depression, anxiety, and fatigue symptoms in first year stroke survivors with and without a COVID-19 infection post-stroke.

Method: Retrospective study using cross-sectional data from the UPACT study. Patients with a stroke in the last year in one of five Dutch hospitals participated. The primary outcomes of the current study consisted of depression, anxiety, and fatigue. This information was analyzed for secondary analysis using Quantile regression for two study groups: the COVID group and non-COVID group. 

Results: 572 stroke survivors were included, 126 experienced a COVID infection. There was significant influence of COVID infection on anxiety, not on depression or fatigue. Daily functioning capability and time since stroke were associated with improved psychosocial symptoms. Previous depression or anxiety, cerebral infarction, sex, or age were associated with an increase in (some of the) psychosocial symptoms. 

Conclusion: COVID infection had a significant influence on anxiety. Influential factors on psychosocial scores varied greatly between study groups, leading to cautionary interpretation of the current findings. Further research is necessary to consider if tailored rehabilitation programs could benefit stroke survivors. 

Practical implications: Even though the COVID pandemic is no longer present, post-stroke COVID-infections can still occur. If COVID infections rise or a pandemic occurs again in the future, stroke rehabilitation may need adjustment, particularly around anxiety."
Unsupervised drift detection in accounting data,"['Ilic, Linda']","['Dirksen, S']",2023-11-09T00:01:11Z,EN,[],Applied Data Science,"As machine learning becomes more popular and available to all sectors

it. As a result, the performance of an ML model might decrease substan-
tially. This change in data is difficult to monitor in the absence of labels. As
this project is in collaboration with the Auditdienst Rijk and labels are not
readily available in their data environment this paper proposes the use of
the STUDD method to detect drift in an unsupervised way. The main hypothesis
is that drift should be detected in new unseen accounting data around
early 2020 when new COVID-19-related policies were implemented and
affected the budget and spending patterns of the Dutch government. Here
we show that the STUDD method successfully detected drift in the new
unseen data early on in the pandemic year. However, this change can not
be attributed to the spread of COVID-19 as policies were implemented a
substantial time after the first drift was detected. This might indicate other
reasons for the changes in the data such as time or some external events
that occurred in the previous year and already induced drift."

Shared Decision-Making in Choosing an Antipsychotic Agent","['Joosten, Loes']","['Bovenschen, Niels']",2023-11-09T00:01:05Z,EN,[],Geneeskunde,"Introduction: In 2016, an online decision aid was developed to involve patients with a psychotic disorder in shared decision-making regarding the choice for antipsychotic medication. The tool combines the needs of the patient, indicated by the patient on a 5 -point Likert scale, with evidence-based ranking of risks or probabilities on a set of criteria. Criteria, based on patient panels, were: effectiveness concerning psychotic, depressive and cognitive symptoms, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, sedation, hypersomnia, extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic adverse effects, hypersalivation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue and blunted affect/less need for companionship. The tool produces a personalised ranking of antipsychotic agents that matches the patients’ preferences. The aim of this paper is to update the tool by adding caripiprazine and brexpiprazol and refining the ranking of amisulpride.
Method: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane. Effect sizes from meta-analyses, receptor affinities and summaries of product characteristics were used to rank the antipsychotics per criterion. Updates were applied to the originally included agents where necessary. The rankings were tested in an expert panel of clinicians to translate the evidence-based data into clinical use.
Results: High-level evidence was available for ranking weight gain, sedation, sexual dysfunction, menstrual disorders, extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic side effects and effectiveness for psychotic and depressive symptoms for all antipsychotic agents, including the newer ones. There was lower-level evidence ranking the remaining criteria.
Discussion & conclusion: A comprehensive update was devised in a systematic approach, resulting in an applicable tool for shared-decision making for current prescription tendencies."
Of Triumphs and Taboos: Assessing Accountability for Perpetrators of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence Against Men in International Criminal Law,"['Ernandes, Judson']","['Brink, M. van den']",2023-11-09T00:00:58Z,EN,[],Public International Law,"These are a few reasons why the topic of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) and conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) towards men is a crucial one to be held, especially within the context of international criminal law. Criminal prosecution is one of the avenues in which justice for victims around the world is achieved and should be effective to provide for all victims without discrimination. As international criminal law is a continuously developing area of international law, understanding SGBV in this context, from its inception until present day, is imperative for its future and ensuring that such impunity is quashed. The establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court gave hope that accountability and justice for grave humanitarian and human rights violations would finally be realised. This thesis analyses the topic of SGBV against men and male victims of CRSV within the framework of international criminal law. This analysis illustrates whether international criminal law satisfies historical and current objectives in achieving justice for international crimes, specifically SGBV in armed conflict. The subsequent subsections investigate the main problem of the thesis through a combination of research methods through the lens of feminist legal methodology. It is important to understand that this methodology is dynamic and stratified. The purpose of applying the feminist legal approach is not to weigh the rights of men against the rights of women; rather, it is to apply the same reasoning which has brought the disbalance of women’s rights under international law to the surface and scrutinised it towards male victims of SGBV."

Een vergunning wordt verstrekt aan personen die ten minste 21 jaar oud zijn, zelfredzaam zijn en een geldige woon- en verblijfsstatus hebben. De zelfredzaamheid van een sekswerker wordt beoordeeld door een gemeenteambtenaar. Klanten van sekswerkers zonder vergunning worden strafbaar, evenals de personen die uit winstbejag betrokken zijn bij onvergunde prostitutie (het 'pooierverbod'). Het wetsvoorstel is ingediend om misstanden in de seksbranche tegen te gaan, zoals mensenhandel en gedwongen prostitutie. 

Lidstaten hebben op grond van artikel 4 EVRM de positieve verplichting om voldoende praktische en effectieve bescherming te bieden tegen gedwongen prostitutie en mensenhandel. Onderdeel van die verplichting is dat lidstaten een adequaat juridisch en administratief raamwerk moeten hebben om mensenhandel en gedwongen prostitutie tegen te gaan. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat Nederland deels al voldoet aan die verplichting (ook zonder invoering van de Wrs): in artikel 273f Sr is namelijk een strafbaarstelling van mensenhandel en gedwongen prostitutie opgenomen. Uit de zaak Rantsev tegen Cyprus en Rusland blijkt echter dat er in zo'n geval toch een schending van artikel 4 EVRM kan zijn, namelijk als de aanpak van een lidstaat in praktijk contraproductief is. Dit onderzoek concludeert dat de Wrs in Nederland kan leiden tot een contraproductieve aanpak. De belangrijkste reden daarvoor is dat een deel van sekswerkers geen vergunning zal willen of kunnen krijgen, maar toch doorgaan met hun werk. Zij belanden daardoor in de illegale seksbranche, waar ze extra kwetsbaar zijn voor seksuele uitbuiting. Ook juridische experts, wetenschappers en belangenorganisaties waarschuwen daarom voor de effecten van het wetsvoorstel. Als de Wrs toch wordt doorgevoerd en onvergunde sekswerkers inderdaad slachtoffer worden van seksuele uitbuiting, levert dat een sterke indicatie op dat Nederland niet voldoet aan de plicht om praktische en effectieve bescherming tegen mensenhandel en gedwongen prostitutie te bieden."

Parental involvement (PI) is an important aspect of quality of education. Academic evidence shows that PI has a positive effect on children ánd schools (Menheere & Hooge, 2010; Dumont et al., 2012). Therefore, potentially working elements of approaches to improve parental involvement (PI) were explored. A synthesized list of such potentially working elements was the output of a systematic literature search and six interviews held at three Dutch primary schools in disadvantaged areas, who actively conduct activities and policies to improve PI. These potentially working elements were contextualized towards the context of primary education in the Ugandan Kamuli district and the Ethiopian Shabee Sombo district, by interviewing experts involved in the Cordaid programs that support the primary schools in these districts. Based on these interviews, implications were formulated to define which indicators could be added to the Cordaid projects to improve quality of education in these primary schools. In both districts, it is suggested that parents could feasibly get involved by organizing informative (thematic) meetings for all parents, e.g. to communicate mutual expectations. Also, informal meetings for parents could be organized to practically contribute to the children’s learning environment, or to enhance low-threshold contact between teachers and parents. These and other elements can be further explored and translated into indicators for Cordaid’s programs. Future research is needed to explore the relation between working elements and conditions related to PI."

Sediment transport processes at the mouth of the Western Scheldt estuary,"['Stobbelaar, Sieuwe']","['Vegt, Maarten van der']",2023-10-12T23:01:10Z,EN,['Sediment transport; Western Scheldt; Measurements'],Earth Surface and Water,"Understanding the sediment transport between the sea and the estuary is crucial for sustainable estuarine management. Sediment fluxes in estuarine environments are controlled by multiple interactive forces like tides, waves, wind, density differences, bathymetry, and trends in sea level rise. Tidal sediment transport is relatively constant while high wave events occur episodically and can transport large amounts of sediment. The sediment transport processes at the mouth of the Scheldt estuary will be studied and the following research questions will be answered: does the sediment transport depend on a) the location in the mouth, b) the position in the vertical and c) the tide, waves and wind?
Measurement frames are used to measure flow velocities and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) at two locations at the mouth of the Western Scheldt estuary, southeast of the Vlakte van de Raan. One measurement site is in a flood channel (F1) and the other in an ebb channel (F3). The measuring frames contained: two Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) & (AQD), two Acoustic Doppler Velocity meters (ADV) and four Optical Backscatter Sensors (OBS). 
With these measurements, flow velocity profiles and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) profiles were created over the vertical, to calculate the sediment transported at the two locations. The influence of the waves and tidal currents were studied by calculating the wave and current induced bed shear stresses. To further analyse the influence of the tides, a Godin filter was used to remove the tidal signal from the flow velocities and the SSC, leaving the influences of the tidal asymmetry and the residual currents. 
The net sediment transport is landward directed in the flood channel and seaward directed in the ebb channel. The near bed sediment transport is larger in the flood channel than the ebb channel (29032 kg/m vs 18507 kg/m). Most sediment transport occurs during spring tides. The direction and magnitude of the net sediment transport is mainly determined by the tidal component of the sediment transport, being four (F1) and tree (F3) times larger than the residual components. The cause of the direction of tidal sediment transport was the difference in SSC between ebb and flood, caused by peak flow velocity and sediment type differences. The asymmetry of the tides is flood dominant in both locations, and the residual currents are seaward, with larger residual currents at F3. The main driving mechanism of the residual currents is the tidally induced residual flow due to differences in bathymetry.
During the measurement period there were no large wave events, therefore, it is difficult to draw conclusion about the role of large wave events on the net sediment transport. Higher waves did cause higher SSCs, but the resulting increase in sediment transport was only slightly visible in the cumulative sediment transport.
This study presents the main sediment transport processes in ebb and flood channels located in a estuary mouth. Because of the highly dynamic nature of the estuary mouth, projecting these findings to other regions is difficult. Thereby, only part of the sediment transport between the sea and the estuary is solved. But with a better understanding of the sediment transport processes, sediment transport models covering larger areas can be improved."

While conducting this research I have taken a closer look at the level of inclusivity in contemporary social impact assessment, looking for possible improvements. I recommend allocating substantial resources to identify all vulnerable groups in the project area and gather sufficient data through appropriate channels. Also, equal attention should be given to both social and environmental aspects during the ESIA process. The inclusion of Gender Impact Assessment should be paramount to addressing vulnerabilities faced by women and recognizing their socio-economic positions in these kinds of big scale development projects. A comprehensive perspective, incorporating both local customs and international guidelines, can lead to and inclusive development initiatives that could yield bigger support of populations and governments."

Its roots can be traced back to the reform of medical education and practice in the United States in the beginning of the twentieth century. Case-based teaching and improvement of practice required structured medical records with templates for patient complaints and history, findings, diagnostic tests, diagnosis, treatments, outcomes, and a standardized medical nomenclature. By the eve of the Second World Ware structured records were the norm in American hospitals. Dutch physicians were fully aware of these developments, but rejected them because of the perceived infringement of professional autonomy. Only after the war the position of Dutch physicians gradually changed. In the 1970s medical specialists agreed on a structured approach for medical record keeping. For general practitioners it started already in 1956 with the founding of their scientific society. The structured medical record was seen as necessity to enhance the scientific basis of primary care practice. By the time that affordable computing became available, general practitioners were ready to adopt the electronic medical record. In medical specialist care paper-based records were only relegated to the bin of history by 2015. Computing in hospitals was for a long time focused on financial and resource planning. Since 1990 a number of incentives moved medical specialists gradually to medical computing. The incentives included regulation, increased communication between physicians, quality of care initiatives and not the least the improvement of the position of the patient. Therefore, different histories of the electronic medical record in the Netherlands can be told. The thesis is guided by the arguments of the historian of science Michael S. Mahoney that computing finds it roots much earlier that the firsts in technology and the work of pioneers."
Korreltje Zout: A Literature Review of Saline Irrigation,"['Ciaglo, Max']","['Appelman, Jaco']",2023-10-17T00:00:37Z,EN,['saline irrigation; urban green space; agriculture'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"Globally, soil salinity and the salinization of water resources is increasing. For plants in 
particular, this trend could be troubling as saline water and soil can cause ion toxicity, osmotic 
stress, and nutrient imbalances. However, responses to salinity vary greatly across the Plantae 
kingdom. In general, three strategies—adaptation, mitigation, and desalinization—can be
applied to address these issues. Mediamatic is an arts, science, and cultural organization that is 
exploring the use of saline water for myriad irrigation projects in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
Their goal is to stop using any tap water to irrigate outdoor gardens and supply an aquaponics 
greenhouse. Within this context I review the current literature discussing the first two strategies 
of adaptation and mitigation and make recommendations for adapting Mediamatic to a
sustainable and salty future. Overall, while some species of plants, and halophytes in particular,
show remarkable resilience to saline conditions, others are very sensitive to salt stress and 
require special attention. Therefore, plant selection is vitally important to adapting to a saline 
irrigation system. However, current literature also describes many potential strategies to 
mitigate these responses to salt stress, allowing a broader range of plants to tolerate high levels 
of salinity. Most literature focuses on using different soil treatments, such as potassium, 
gypsum, and bio-organic amendments to alter ion imbalances in the soil and promote uptake of 
vital nutrients. Further research suggests different irrigation strategies, such as mulched drip 
irrigation and freshwater flushing of the soil to control the salt levels in the soil. Taken together, 
I recommend that Mediamatic employ a mulched drip irrigation system that is supplemented 
with bio-organic soil amendments, while also choosing plants that can tolerate the moderate 
salinity level of the brackish water in the Dijksgracht with an EC of ~2-5 dS m-1. I also 
recommend that they increase their rainwater storage capacity for use in the aquaponics system 
and for flushing outdoor irrigated areas. Finally, I outline the design of a potential integrated 
system of all irrigated areas within Mediamatic, where I propose to implement a stage-based 
halophyte filter."
The Effects of a Socially Assistive Robot on Engagement and Self-Disclosure to improve Emotion Regulation during One-on-One Child-Youth Coach Conversations: A Case Study,"['Reuver, Stan de']","['Graaf, M.M.A. de']",2023-10-16T23:01:00Z,EN,"['emotion regulation, engagement, self-disclosure, socially assistive robot, social robot, youth care']",Business Informatics,"Numerous children have difficulties in regulating their emotions and suffer consequences such as the development of mental health issues, or deal with societal challenges like criminal behavior, low personal well-being, and academic struggles. This research investigates the potential for improving children’s emotional regulation by increasing their engagement and self-disclosure during one-on-one conversations with youth coaches in the youth care sector, while using a personalized SAR.

A case-study was done where participants talked to a SAR called ’Buddy’. Buddy did not replace the youth coach during the one-on-one conversations, but served as an ’ice-breaker’ in a Wizard-of-Oz set-up that intended to increase engagement and disclosure about emotion-related experiences of the child to the youth coach. Engagement coding and thematic coding, as well as statistical analyses, evaluations and interviews, and questionnaires were conducted to investigate SAR effectiveness.

Deploying the SAR only led to a slight increase in engagement, and there were mixed results in terms of self-disclosure among participants. The correlations between engagement, self-disclosure, and emotion-related themes were generally weakly positive or moderately negative. Contrary to these results, youth coaches held a very positive view of Buddy’s deployment, foreseeing its future potential. Additionally, participants enjoyed conversing with the SAR, and there was evidence of improved emotional regulation over time based on questionnaire responses.

In the end, we cannot conclude that introducing a SAR in one-on-one conversations between a child and youth coach improves emotional regulation. The limited number of participants in this study limits the applicability and reliability of the findings. Although we cannot draw any conclusions, research does describe positive effects of SAR deployment for ER improvement, and we also found some minor positive results that support the effect. Nevertheless, this research sheds light on the reasons behind resistance to participating in experiments where SARs are deployed, and offers suggestions for future prevention of this resistance. Future studies could investigate the impact of SARs with different approaches in various settings, and further explore engagement, self-disclosure, and ER enhancement."

aspects, which deviates from the conventional three-stage accountability process encompassing 
informing, debating, and consequences. Transparency, rooted in government discourse, is 
selective. The AR adopts open-source practices and platforms but centers on efficient governance. 
By centralizing algorithms, it aims for efficient supervision and increased transparency. However, 
there are gaps: the AR promotes transparency but isn't wholly transparent, and it prioritizes 
feedback over enforcing consequences. The AR leans towards technical issues over societal 
concerns, and AR development discourses may validate governmental algorithmic development 
biases, equating accountability through transparency with responsibility"

field has been left largely unexplored by both historians and climatologists.
In this project, we aim at providing a contribution to fill this gap.
Our focus is on the late Roman Empire, from the onset of the third century
crisis (235 AD) to the fall of the Western Roman Empire (476 AD). This period
coincided with climatic change in Europe, as it represented the transition
between the Roman Warm Period and the Dark Ages Cold Period.
We are interested in exploring the relation between climate change and the
Empire’s crisis, through the use of a computational simulation of the Empire’s
agricultural productivity and food staples economy. The project was
divided in two phases. First we constructed a simulation that reproduced
the known historical trade patterns around 200 AD to a reasonable level of
accuracy. In a second phase, we tested this simulation through a different
reconstructed climate forcing and evaluated the anomaly between them.
We found that the climate transition caused a significant rise in grain import
costs in several cities of the Roman East, which could justify some of
the Empire’s socio-economic issues starting around the 3rd century AD."

Directionality in mission-oriented innovation: an assessment of the directionality challenges in the mission towards a carbon-free electricity system in the Netherlands,"['Teems, Jeroen van der']","['Frenken, Koen']",2023-11-02T01:01:37Z,EN,['Mission-oriented innovation policy; MIP; directionality; innovation policy; electricity system; energy transition; societal challenges'],Innovation Sciences,"Background. Mission-oriented and transformative innovation policy are increasingly gaining attention from policymakers, particularly in the light of grand societal challenges. Societies are faced with major challenges such as climate change and ambitious goals are set to address those challenges. This also implies a larger responsibility for policy makers to set directions in which socio-technical transitions need to move to address the societal challenges. 

Theory. Providing such directions is coined directionality. Apart from that the interpretation of what directionality entails differs between literature streams, there is currently also little empirical evidence on how directionality manifests itself in practice or how practitioners can achieve directionality in practice. In order to provide more guidance and aid in the understanding of what challenges may emerge during the process of translating societal goals into actionable policy, a conceptual framework was created to identify directionality challenges.

Aim. The aim of this study was to apply the framework to a new case study, namely the mission towards a carbon-free electricity system in 2050 in the Netherlands.  This mission contributes to the overarching Dutch climate goals to become climate by 2050. This mission is exceptionally well suited for assessing directionality, considering that the energy transition has an impact on entire societies and thus arguably requires the right directions at the right times. In addition, this study also contributes to literature by applying the framework to a novel case, and it contributes to the understanding of practitioners what directionality challenges they may face.

Method. A combination of desk research (policy briefs, reports, official documents) and 18 interviews with relevant stakeholders were utilised to assess the directionality challenges that are experienced in the context of the mission.

Results. A total of ten directionality challenges were identified: handling goal conflicts, defining system boundaries, identifying realistic pathways, formulating strategies, realising destabilisation, nurturing public engagement, mobilising relevant policy domains, identifying target groups, accessing intervention points, and governance. The new ‘mission governance’ that built upon the existing Top Sector governance was found to be unclear.

Discussion/Conclusion. Goals are clear to an extent, though there is demand for more directionality to be provided by the government. As many activities are currently undertaken in a sectoral perspective, there is a need for a more integrated approach that goes beyond sectoral or policy domain boundaries. The Netherlands is making efforts to facilitate this through national plans."

This research set out to map the potential of Dutch community supported agriculture (CSA) in bringing about such structural transformation, additionally exploring how this potential could be further harnessed in the future. An extensive literature review and semi-structured interviews with CSA farmers, members, and experts were conducted for this purpose. The findings uncovered that CSA has the potential to challenge and address underlying philosophies and patterns on which the conventional Dutch food system rests, and that cause the interrelated ecological and socio-economic issues stemming from this system. Dutch CSA does this by empowering conscious actors to translate their sustainable worldviews into locally adapted practices that reconnect society and nature in harmony, fostering social and supportive communities that enhance awareness creation, leading to further emergence of CSA. The research furthermore identified enablers and barriers for CSA’s transformative potential on three embedded and interrelated layers, including a practical, political and a deeper layer that encompasses values, beliefs, and worldviews. CSA’s transformative potential could be enhanced through holistic schooling that fosters sustainable value, worldview, and awareness creation, and governance and incentive systems could be redirected to create a facilitating environment for CSA and for diverse societal groups to engage in CSA. The synthesis of this study’s results adds to previous literature that explored transformative aspects of CSA, instead of CSA’s potential to bring about transformative change, and that predominantly focused on general barriers and enablers for CSA on practical and political levels, overlooking deeper level worldviews, values, and beliefs that are instrumental to transformative change. Further emergence of Dutch CSA can start a transformative spiral towards a sustainable and just food system that allocates the benefits of the Dutch agri-food landscape back to society."
Fashioning a Just Future: Analysing the Role of Sustainability Due Diligence Reporting in Enabling a Just Transition in the Fashion Industry,"['Bandell, Gemma']","['Kalfagianni, Agni']",2023-11-02T01:01:44Z,EN,['Just Transition; Sustainability Due Diligence; Fashion Industry; Fashion Justice; Responsible Business Conduct; CSRD'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Research problem and aim: The need for a just transition (JT) in the fashion industry is undisputed due to its adverse impacts on the environment and people. Meanwhile, sustainability due diligence (SDD) is considered a viable approach to conduct responsible business. However, academic understanding of how SDD could enable a JT is still underexplored and these fields have rarely been combined before. Therefore, this research examines the dimensions of justice that are being pursued in the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) to enable a JT in the fashion industry. As such, this research aims to define what a JT entails in the fashion industry to provide insights into the role of SDD in JTs.

Theory: This research combined the equity framework from McDermott et al. (2013) and literature on SDD to operationalise four parameters of what a JT entails in relation to SDD.

Methodology: A qualitative embedded research design utilising multiple research methods and units of analysis has been employed. The parameters of a JT have been determined based on interviews with Dutch fashion industry stakeholders, which were supplemented with desk research. An open axial coding strategy was used to analyse the data. The CSRD and ESRS documents were analysed based on a thematic coding strategy.

Results: Findings suggest that meaningful SDD evolves around stakeholder dialogue to identify and manage adverse impacts and therefore largely reflects procedural and recognition justice. This is pursued in the CSRD and ESRS as the core of their SDD. However, the dimensions of contextual and restorative justice are not pursued because the CSRD and ESRS lack reflection on roles, power relationships, and causes of existing disparities. Regarding distributive justice, the results of this research endorse that the integration of social adverse impacts into ambitions on lowering environmental impacts and the discussion regarding trade-offs between impacts are needed to make ESRS a meaningful way to enable a JT in the fashion industry.

Discussion and conclusion: This research contributes a novel perspective to literature on JT, fashion justice, and SDD by taking an interdisciplinary approach and turning attention to the social justice implications of transition strategies that rely on SDD. It provides critical examinations of power relations amongst stakeholders and shines new light on the dimension of distributive justice. Overall, this research recommends that the EU should pin down its meaning of justice because it currently remains too broad and non-explicit to enable a JT through the CSRD and ESRS."
"Assessing the End-User Affordability of Electricity from Solar Mini-grids in Refugee Settlements in
Sub-Saharan Africa","['Verwoerd, Anne-Kirsten']","['Fumagalli, Elena']",2023-11-02T01:01:47Z,EN,['Solar mini-grids; refugee camps; affordability; levelised cost of electricity'],Sustainable Development,"Renewable mini-grids offer a solution to extend electricity access in displacement camps. In these camps, electricity access is extremely limited; 94% of forcibly displaced people living in these camps do not have access to electricity (Grafham, 2022). The role of the private sector to supply these mini-grids is increasingly recognised. To mobilise the private sector, it must be demonstrated that mini-grids are financially viable, which requires that they can recoup their lifetime costs (both the initial investment and operational costs) from the expected revenue. This requires charging a tariff rate that is cost-reflective but is also affordable for the refugee population. This research generates cost-reflective tariffs for mini-grids in 12 refugee camps in Sub-Saharan Africa (i.e., Malawi, Zambia, and Uganda) and investigates whether these tariffs are affordable for households and businesses within these camps. The first part of this research involves reviewing and amending the financial module of the KALO-model. This model is used to size the mini-grids for the 12 camps and compute the corresponding levelised cost of electricity (LCOE), which gives the cost-reflective tariff. The cost-reflective tariffs are assessed against willingness to pay data collected from the field (Casati et al., 2023), i.e., the monetary amount that households and businesses expressed that they are willing to pay for electricity per month. The proportion of households and of businesses who can afford the cost-reflective tariff is determined for the 12 camps, which is referred to as the ‘affordability rate’ in this paper. The LCOE obtained are 43 USD kWh-1 for the camps Meheba, Zambia; Dzaleka, Malawi; and five camps in the Adjumani district in Uganda. The LCOE is 37 USD kWh-1 for five other camps in the Adjumani district. The results of this research show that 84% of households in Meheba, 53% in Dzaleka, 51% in five camps in the Adjumani district, and 32% in another five camps in the Adjumani district can afford the cost-reflective tariff. For businesses in Meheba, Dzaleka, and the Adjumani district, affordability rates are 37%, 96%, and 18-19%, respectively. The affordability rates of both end-user groups increase substantially when considering subsidies of the initial investment cost. Lastly, the cost-reflective tariffs are not cost-competitive against the tariffs of the national grid."

This study investigates ammonia’s value chain from import to end-use applications, addressing crucial transitional challenges. Key obstacles in the adoption of renewable ammonia include cost competitiveness, safety concerns, lack of governmental cooperation and policy support, and the absence of off-take agreements. Main conclusions underscore the need for a stronger value proposition for ammonia, gradual integration into existing markets, exploration of ammonia’s role in power generation, and thorough market research. Furthermore, the study suggests leveraging barge and rail infrastructure as demand is too unclear to justify the construction of an ammonia pipeline. In summary, this research highlights the significance of ammonia in decarbonization while outlining critical steps and challenges for its successful integration into sustainable energy systems."

Location specific factors that shape the future rollout of advanced biofuel production in the European Union,"['Rothenburger, Kai']","['Hoefnagels, Ric']",2023-11-16T00:00:56Z,EN,['Advanced Biofuels; Industrial location; Agglomeration; Location specific factors; EU'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The EU aims to become climate neutral by 2050. Based and on the importance of the transport sector for decarbonization strategies, European policies and regulations foster the development and establishment of advanced biofuels. Considering the current slack in development of advanced biofuels, acceleration of development, and a pan-European rollout of such fuels, are urgently needed. The importance of locational conditions and location specific factors for sustainable energy production, as well as their relevance for a potential large-scale deployment has been pointed out. Yet the predominant lack of information about which location specific factors will shape this required deployment in the EU is ubiquitous and constitutes the research question’s objective. To approach this blind spot, the industrial location theory serves as an analytical framework in this thesis and supports realizing the research purpose. Based on the theory’s assumptions of transport cost, agglomeration, infrastructure, and policy conditions being vital for industrial location decisions, dynamics, interrelationships, and interdependencies in the field were investigated. Three different approaches were utilized to answer the research question, starting with a location analysis of plants currently producing intermediates or final fuels using lignocellulosic feedstock. Moreover, a review of supply chain modelling studies allowed for deductions relating to optimization viewpoints. Simultaneously, semi-structured interviews with 17 experts from relevant industries contributed to necessary in-field insights and perspectives. The study identified distinct location specific factors. Those factors center around case specific opportunities for transport- and production cost reduction and point at feedstock availability and feedstock proximity as fundamental prerequisites. Subsequently, making use of existing (transportation-) infrastructure and industrial areas was found to be vital. Strategies including Retrofitting, Co-location, Co-processing were identified to be elementary for reducing advanced biofuel production cost. Centralized- and distributed supply chains designs emerged as most likely options for the future rollout. Centralized and simple supply chains for smaller scale production plants and distributed supply chains for larger plant capacities and more complex supply chains. The thesis concludes that using existing infrastructure, suitable industries and feedstock abundant areas constitute important and foundational location specific factors. Facilitating the rollout requires for scenario and case specific policy instruments. Yet, the results indicate that the rollout will not take place in the needed time."
"A Chance at Doing the Right Thing. Discursive Strategies of Dutch Business and the Construction of 'CSR', 1971-2004","['Palamar, Jasmin']","['Grift, Liesbeth van de']",2023-11-16T00:00:59Z,EN,"['corporate social responsibility, business, discursive strategies, story-lines, Hajer']",History,"Why could a pro-CSR global environment suddenly arise in the 1990s? Scholars have recently argued that companies took an active lead in spreading ideas and practices associated with ‘corporate social responsibility’, in order to defend their business interests against political threats, or to legitimize neoliberal reforms. However, current research lacks a rigorous contextualized analysis of the arguments with which business actors sought to convince the rest of society of the plausibility of CSR, i.e., of their voluntary socialization. This thesis researches the ideational role of business firms in legitimizing CSR as a means of social regulation in the Netherlands between 1971 and 2004. It approaches arguments found in the publications of Stichting Maatschappij en Onderneming – an inter-firm organization – as contextualized ‘discursive strategies’ which communicated specific ‘story-lines’. This thesis argues that Dutch business contributed significantly to legitimizing CSR in two distinct phases. Business firstly contributed to laying the argumentative foundations for the concept by justifying it as a ‘probational’ measure to give business a ‘chance at doing the right thing’ (1971-1983). After this more argumentative period, business focused on the subjectivation of government officials and business actors in accordance with the social-neoliberal regulatory ‘package’ it had started promoting (1983-2004). To this end, it also aimed at developing useful management concepts to facilitate the voluntary socialization of firms. Tensions between free enterprise and socialization nevertheless persisted in the ‘balancing of interests’ which CSR demanded of business managers."
Sustainable Aviation Fuel Implementation Strategies for European Airports,"['Rodriguez, Helena']","['Hoefnagels, Ric']",2023-11-16T08:34:32Z,EN,['SAF; ReFuelEU; role of airports; SAF implementation in airports; SAF uptake'],Sustainable Development,"As the ambitious ReFuelEU mandate comes into force, with the goal of increasing the
production and usage of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), the aviation sector has still to face 
uncertainties and questions about how this mandate will develop. The main obligations 
currently fall upon fuel suppliers and aircraft operators to meet certain SAF volumes;
nevertheless, airports as the physical connecting point between them can still have a relevant 
role to play in the successful deployment and usage of SAF.
The mandate has not laid out clear strategies or guidelines for airports on what their role might 
be within the rollout of the mandate, aside from ensuring the fuel infrastructure is ready for the 
safe deployment of SAF. Airports and other stakeholders in the industry are left wondering and 
questioning the role of airports and which strategies should they implement to support the 
mandate. Incorporating background information, literature reviews, expert interviews, and 
stakeholder consultation notes, the research provides a guide to help airports understand their
role and the steps needed to implement strategies in line with the ReFuelEU mandate. 
This research investigates the role of airports within the fuel supply chain and their relationship 
not only to the mandate but to the deployment of SAF as an innovation; and what strategies 
airports can implement to support the SAF uptake by the industry. The research argues that 
airports can take on facilitator, enabler, lobbyist, and advocating roles, to support SAF 
deployment and the mandate. 
There is a significant amount of information on strategies and best practices airports could 
implement to boost SAF uptake, nevertheless, many have not acted upon this, as the mandate 
and their context are not understood properly. Therefore, the guide provides five steps to help 
airports understand their own context and use it to their advantage to create strategic roadmaps
that include SAF uptake strategies. 
While the guide lays out the first steps to helping airports find their spot within the mandate,
multi-stakeholder collaboration between airports and relevant players is necessary to meet the 
mandate's goals. Additionally, collaboration between other sectors/industries, and 
countries/regions is required to avoid conflicting competition for feedstock and fuel."

Background: The number of elderly people in the population is increasing, therefore additional healthcare professionals are needed. ‘Working differently in healthcare’ is a collaborative program that selects promising innovations which they test and implement within healthcare organizations. One of these promising innovations is the Medido medication dispenser. It will remind clients to take medication at an accurate set time. Goal is to relieve pressure on healthcare professionals and to contribute to the client's self-management. In the Netherlands, Medido is in use in extramural care settings with promising results. The current study focuses on validating the results within the outpatient care setting and obtaining novel results in an inpatient care setting.
Aim: To gain insight in the experiences of clients living in inpatient care with regard to the use of the Medido medication dispenser 
Methods: The study has a qualitative descriptive study design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve clients and three healthcare professionals. In addition, a survey was conducted among four healthcare professionals. A thematic analysis was performed to identify patterns and themes in the interviews. 
Results: Four themes that described the clients' experiences emerged: implementation, usability, client support and acceptance. The guidance and support went smoothly. Clients found Medido easy to use. They saw it as support to be able to take their medication independently and found it useful to use. 
Conclusion: Medido, supports patients living within inpatient care with complex care needs. The implementation of Medido went smoothly. In addition, clients found Medido easy and pleasant to use and see it as a support to be able to take their medication independently. Furthermore, the clients found Medido useful to use and were open to using this technology. 
Recommendations: The use of Medido contributes to the self-management of the clients. It is recommended to apply Medido as a form of reablement more widely within inpatient care to enable more clients to take their medication independently. The results of this study reinforces the need to involve clients more in the Medido project through co-creation sessions."

However, research shows that optimal pharmacotherapy often is not achieved, because of drug-related problems (DRPs) patients experience with their medication use. Objective To assess DRPs orthopaedic patients experience within six weeks post discharge, so that patients’ pharmaceutical support needs can be mapped Setting Orthopaedic department of the Sint Maartenskliniek (SMK) in the Netherlands. Methods Adult orthopaedic patients participated in this qualitative study. In May and June 2021 individual interviews were held. Patients were interviewed two times, one week and six weeks post discharge, to map the DRPs patients experience within six weeks post discharge. A semi-structured interview guide is compiled from the TRIAGE and is based on ten domains: knowledge barriers, concerns, necessity, practical intake problems, adverse reactions, complexity of the medication, social support, costs, being able to understand or apply information and problems with incorporating intake in daily routine. Primary outcome measure Drugrelated problems. Analysis Interviews were analysed and coded independently by two different researchers (AL, EM) in EXCEL version 2105 Results In total 15 patients were interviewed and 29 interviews were conducted. Five main themes derived from the qualitative data: (I) Insufficient knowledge; many patients were not aware of which medication they take and what adverse reactions their medicines could cause (II) Negative cognition; a lot of patients had a negative view when it comes to medication use. Patients worry about what potential side effects their medication could give (III) Practical barriers; mainly arise with the use of antibiotics and thrombosis prophylaxis (IV) Inadequate drug use; could lead to insufficient effect or drug misuse (V) Negative experience; insufficient effect, prescribed medication caused trouble with comorbidity and adverse reactions. Most DRPs are present with the use of oxycodone and antibiotics. Conclusion Orthopaedic patients experience DRPs post discharge. This qualitative study provides insight in which DRPs orthopaedic patients experience post discharge. Patients have difficulty taking their medication adequately due to insufficient knowledge, negative cognition, practical barriers. This may lead to negative experiences with their medication use. Good education about the benefits and risks of medicines is necessary."
Parenting Perception of Young Malawian Parents,"['Hondelink, Riëlle']","['Groot, Tjitske de']",2023-11-16T08:34:35Z,EN,['parenting; parenting intervention; positive parenting; young parents; Malawi'],"Youth, Education and Society","In Malawi, the number of young parents has significantly increased over the past decade. This is due to many factors, such as poverty and a lack of economic and social opportunities for young people. Being a young parent in a low-income environment can have negative consequences for both the parent and the child. As the lives of young parents in Malawi can be challenging, having additional support can offer a way for these parents to better fulfil their family’s needs. This support can be provided by a parenting intervention, such as ‘The Parenting Challenge’ (TPC). This intervention aims to improve children’s lives through enhancing parents’ parenting skills. The present study conducted research into the self-reported influence of TPC on young Malawian parents’ perception of parenting. This was done through interviews with ten parents who have previously participated in TPC. Findings revealed that TPC has influenced the perception of parenting of young parents in rural Malawi. The results showed that the parenting intervention helped improve the young parents’ parenting skills, in relation to both basic needs as well as additional parenting skills. These additional parenting skills provide the parents with the tools to give their children the adequate and relevant support. The findings offer insight into the influence of TPC on young Malawian parents’ perception of parenting and contribute to scientific research on the effects of positive parenting on children’s and parents’ development and well-being."

Here, the benefits and risks of using a down-gradient abstraction well in an aquifer storage transfer and recovery (ASTR) system were studied. A one-layered model was constructed using MODFLOW 6, to evaluate the effect of ambient flow, dispersion, injection volume and uncertainties in magnitude and angle of the flow velocity on the RE and optimized down-gradient well position. Numerical modelling showed that the numerical optimized well distance closely relates to the analytical calculated displacement distance for longitudinal dispersivities ≤ 0.5 m. At these dispersivities, ASTR systems at optimized well distances, with ambient flow > 0 m/y result in higher RE’s compared to ASR systems up to 60% of the total injected water volume. Smaller injection volumes with smaller resulting hydraulic radii showed high sensitivity to edge effects decreasing both the optimized well distance and corresponding optimized RE. Uncertainties in angle and magnitude of the groundwater flow decrease the effectivity of the optimized well positioning and with that also the RE drops. ASTR systems are potentially powerful systems to increase RE in regions with ambient flow. Their success is, however, highly dependent on the accurate determination of subsurface parameters, such as direction and magnitude of ambient flow."

This study examines whether and how the Heroines! Project, a role-model intervention developed for primary schools, has an effect on the gender stereotypes of children between 6 and 10 years old. The study uses two methods: qualitative interviews with eight teachers about their classroom observations after completion of the project, and a quantitative analysis of 17 sets of children's drawings, in which students drew themselves as hero(in)es, before and after the project. The interviews revealed that a number of teachers reported changes in areas of future aspirations among the children, improved class dynamics between boys and girls, and in both boys and girls, a change in behavior - in the former in gender-stereotypical beliefs about the project and in the latter in increased self-confidence. Identification with the role models plays a key role in this. The drawing analysis showed that in all categories there were no to minor changes. Despite the mixed-method approach, the small sample of drawings may be the reason for the ambiguous results. Moreover, in future research it is recommended that the drawing analysis be approached in more inclusive manner. Nevertheless, it can be stated that the Heroines! Project is a source of inspiration and new insights for many children, regardless of their gender identity. To diversify the composition of people based on gender on a larger scale in professional fields, similar interventions in middle childhood can play a great role."
Collaborative Governance for Adaptation to Multi-Risk in the Dutch North Sea,"['Dochiu, Corina']","['Triyanti, Annisa']",2023-10-14T23:00:54Z,EN,[],Sustainable Development,"The Dutch North Sea is a space of tremendous economic potential in which efficient organisation of space is key for enduring climate adaptation. Climate change exacerbates natural hazards that pose dangers to the infrastructure set out to be installed at sea. The Dutch Government elaborated a medium-term plan that steers the system towards key transitions in energy production, food systems and ecosystem conservation. The user groups are currently participating in the governance efforts but there are still trade-offs to be made. Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways for Multi Risk (DAPP-MR) represents a methodology in development that MYRIAD-EU aims to tailor for use in transboundary sea settings. This research analyses the collaborative governance regime of the Dutch North Sea to understand where potential lock-ins might occur when attempting to implement DAPP-MR in this system. Taking advantage of being part of the MYRIAD-EU project and the collaboration with Deltares, this research uses primary data from the first North Sea pilot stakeholder workshop and internal sessions. Concurrently, interviews with experts in the field were conducted and an extensive literature review and document analysis were also used. The results showed a governance system that has already started to implement collaborative processes, but the system also has a preference for some activities over others. The user groups that fell within the spectrum of the research have displayed siloed thinking when it comes to climate adaptation. Both compatibilities and incompatibilities between activities would impact how multi-use of space can occur. There are knowledge gaps regarding systems impacts, and those are being taken into decision-making due to the urgency with which the government treats climate action. Furthermore, there were also gaps in single hazards to multi-hazard to multi-risk thinking in this system. DAPP-MR could be used to navigate the uncertainties of this system in theory, but more research and potential changes to the method are required.  The conceptualisation of space as the resource of a socio-ecological system represents a starting point in both developing collaborative governance and DAPP-MR for use in maritime areas. Further research is required in both fields, as well as in multi-hazard and multi-risk thinking that should develop in this area."
How Object-Centric is Object-Centric Predictive Process Monitoring? Introducing Objects into Object-Centric Predictive Process Monitoring,"['Smit, Tim']","['Lu, X.']",2023-10-13T01:01:16Z,EN,['Object-Centric Process Mining; Graph Machine Learning; Predictive Process Monitoring; Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks; Feature Encoding'],Business Informatics,"The field of process mining is challenged by the complexity of true processes when extracting accurate process behavior and statistics from information systems. Traditional process mining algorithms assume a single case notion, whereas actual processes contain many possible ones, represented by objects. 
    Object-centric process mining has been introduced as a case-agnostic solution, which mitigates the problem of misleading process behavior and statistics via the object-centric event log (OCEL). It allows multiple case notions which are called object types. Objects have many-to-many relationships with events.
    However, when performing predictive process monitoring on OCELs, issues arise when including object information as features due to these many-to-many relationships. This has not been addressed by existing literature.
    We propose a heterogeneous object event graph encoding (HOEG), that incorporates events and objects into a graph with different node types.
    We evaluate our novel encoding against an extant graph-based encoding and several baselines on the task of remaining time prediction. On our HOEG we employ a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) architecture that is converted from a homogeneous one. The HOEG-based GNN learns an optimal way to include object information when forming predictions. 
    The experiments are executed on three OCELs, one of which is extracted from an operational process at a large Dutch financial institution.
    Our results indicate that HOEG outperforms its competition for well-structured OCELs. Furthermore, we argue that HOEG mainly excels when OCELs host informative object attributes and abundant object interactions. 
    Considering this, we propose HOEG as a promising general technique to leverage the multi-dimensional data structure given in OCELs for tasks like predicting process remaining time."

The Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA) is a validated screening instrument to assess cognitive performance. Recent literature introduced an age-, education- and sex-adjusted interpretation method to enhance clinical accuracy of the MoCA. However, its clinical applicability in brain injury patients is currently unknown.
Objective: To evaluate the clinical relevance of the demographic-adjusted MoCA (DA-MoCA)
interpretation to detect cognitive impairment among acquired brain injuries patients.
Methods: We studied two brain injury cohorts. Firstly, a data analysis of the Restore4stroke Cohort (n=347) at 2 months post-stroke was performed. Secondly, a prospective cohort including 51 brain injury patients admitted at the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU) was studied. We compared cognitive impairment rates between the original- and DA-MoCA interpretation. Differences in patient characteristics in patients with opposite outcome were explored.
Results: We compared cognitive impairment rates between the original- and DA-MoCA interpretation. According to the DA-MoCA cognitive impairment rates dropped by 19.8% (Restore4Stroke) and 7.8%  (UMCU), and no participants were newly diagnosed as cognitively impaired. Participants reclassified  as not cognitively impaired according to the DA-MoCA were characterized by significantly lower levels  of education in the Restore4Stroke cohort and by older age in the clinical brain injury cohort (UMCU).
Conclusion: The DA-MoCA interpretation reduces the number of participants diagnosed with 
cognitive impairment, primary by correcting for the influence of age and education on cognitive  functioning. The DA-MoCA interpretation could particularly be relevant for populations characterized by extremes in age and education."

countries contributed to the increase or decrease in the bilateral trade flows. Using a political
index which places all ruling coalitions from 1991 to 2022 on a spectrum from fully left-wing
to fully right-wing, the study uses a panel data approach, with the dependent variables being
total trade volume, imports, and exports. The study finds that the political leanings of the
governments impacted imports – the countries imported more from each other under a rightwing rule. The results are further proven when conducting a placebo test between Bulgaria and
Greece as a dyad with amicable political relations where no impact was found on trade by
ideology."

school clubs, and after applying exclusion criteria, a final sample of 618 participants was included.
The adolescents completed the Parental Bonding Inventory, while their respective teachers provided
ratings using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire to assess the children's behaviour. Contrary
to our hypothesis, we did not find support for the proposed relationship, possibly due to a limited
range of variability in the data. In addition to examining the overall score of the Strengths and
Difficulties Questionnaire, which also did not support our hypothesis, we conducted a further
exploratory analysis to investigate the potential buffering effect of father warmth on current stress.
We found support for this relationship and propose that father warmth may serve as a protective factor

These fluctuations carry through into the Hubble parameter, affecting cosmological observables. We show that time delays of strong gravitational lenses are dressed by this effect, and correlators of said time delays acquire an angular dependence. To investigate this angular dependence, we construct the angular power spectrum of time delay correlators. Subsequently, we hone in on a specific realization of a fluctuating dark energy density, considering quantum fluctuations of a light scalar field in the early universe and their subsequent imprinted spatial correlations today. We then perform a forecast using a mock dataset for the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), comparing the effect to correlations of weak gravitational lenses in regular Lambda CDM."
"Onzichtbaar? - Het personeel van de Nederlandse adel, 1890-1940","['Storm, B.K.']","['Vulto, Renée']",2023-08-31T00:01:37Z,NL,"['adel, adellijke, personeel, huispersoneel, kasteel, kastelen, zuylen, verwolde, amerongen, middachten, koetsier, huisknecht, butler, nederland, keukenmeid, werkmeid, linnenmeid, upstairs, downstairs,']",Cultuurgeschiedenis van modern Europa,"In dit onderzoek staat de vraag centraal hoe het personeel van adellijke families samenleefde met hun adellijke werkgevers in de periode 1890-1940 in Nederland. Om deze vraag te beantwoorden is archiefmateriaal uit de adellijke huisarchieven geanalyseerd en zijn een aantal oral history-bronnen bestudeerd. Hierbij is er onder andere gebruikgemaakt van de reading against the grain-methode. 
Uit de analyse volgen een aantal conclusies over de omgang tussen het personeel en de adellijke familie. Allereerst moet er een onderscheid gemaakt worden in het personeel. Zo was er een vaste kern, functies die uitgeoefend werden door mensen die langer in dienst bleven, en een flexibele schil, functies waarin het personeel elkaar juist snel opvolgde. De vaste kern had meer persoonlijk contact met adellijke familie. Ten tweede blijkt, door met het kunsthistorische kader van Mark Girouard naar de huizen te kijken, dat de vaak als rigide gescheiden geziene werelden van upstairs en downstairs in de praktijk op een complexe manier juist verweven waren. Zo kregen ook de personeelsruimtes elektriciteit en sanitair bij moderniseringen van het huis en kwamen familieleden ook in personeelsvertrekken. Ten derde kan geconcludeerd worden dat het contact tussen het personeel en de adellijke familie vaak paradoxaal in elkaar zat. Met behulp van een dramaturgisch perspectief en de terminologie van Erving Goffman blijkt hoe de omgang in het bijzijn van anderen vooral bestond uit vaststaande sociale scripts waaraan de familie, maar ook soms het personeel, status kon ontlenen. Bovendien blijkt dat er enerzijds sprake was van wederzijdse afhankelijkheid en diepgaande betrokkenheid van het personeel bij het persoonlijke leven van de familie. Anderzijds was er altijd het sociale klassenverschil en de machtsrelatie. Dit resulteerde in een balanceeract waarbij het personeel soms heel dichtbij het privéleven van de familie stond en op andere momenten weer afstand moest nemen.
De resultaten van dit onderzoek hebben een bijdrage geleverd aan de bestaande historiografie. Zo heeft het onderzoek een history from below-perspectief aan de adelsgeschiedenis toegevoegd door specifiek naar het personeel te kijken. Daarnaast heeft het onderzoek getoond dat het van belang is om het personeel en de adellijke families niet te veel als rigide gescheiden of als tegenstelling te zien, omdat juist de relatie tussen beide groepen veel verteld over het leven op adellijke huizen."
A Game of Perspectives: An MRI-Based Analysis of Implicit Mind-Brain Models in Schizophrenia,"['Álvarez Durán, Pedro']","['Os, Jim van']",2023-10-18T23:01:08Z,EN,[],Medical Imaging,"Our exploration of schizophrenia encompassed a multi-dimensional analysis from three distinct perspectives: research, philosophy, and fieldwork. A central focus of our investigation delved into the intricate relationship between the brain and the mind, with particular attention to the enigmatic explanatory gap that has long challenged our comprehension. Within the realm of research, a prevailing paradigm often implies a model in which the mind emerges as a product of the brain. This prevailing model, alongside the disjointed
nature of these three perspectives—research, philosophy, and fieldwork—operating in relative isolation, underscores a critical issue. To transcend these constraints and to advance our understanding of schizophrenia, the brain-mind interaction, and the well-being of patients, we advocate resolutely for a holistic approach. Such an approach harmonizes the biological, social, and psychological dimensions of this complex condition, fostering personalized care strategies tailored to individual clinical profiles while addressing the broader needs of patients, including facets of identity, meaning, and resilience. In essence, our analysis underscores the imperative of unifying these distinct realms of inquiry, emphasizing that a holistic perspective holds the key to not only bridging the persistent gap between the brain and the mind but also to vastly improving the quality of care and support for individuals grappling with schizophrenia, thereby revolutionizing the landscape of mental healthcare."
Automatic Cerebral Perfusion Imaging using Deep Learning for Digital Subtraction Angiography,"['Marc, Flavius']","['Pluim, Josien']",2023-10-18T23:01:12Z,EN,['deep learning; computer vision; internal carotid artery segmentation; deconvolution; X-ray; DSA; perfusion'],Medical Imaging,"Visualization of blood flow in brain vessels is crucial for neurovascular disease patients, including the evaluation of ischemic stroke treatments. X-ray Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) is the standard imaging modality used for this purpose. So far, visual inspection is the primary way to assess DSA series. Due to the high temporal resolution of DSA, it holds great potential in facilitating quantitative assessment of cerebral hemodynamics. Various parametric perfusion images have been generated from DSA based on temporal blood flow characteristics. This technique is commonly referred to as perfusion DSA. Such parameters include cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), time to maximum (Tmax), and mean transit time (MTT) and can be generated using deconvolution techniques. To obtain these deconvolution-based images, an arterial input function (AIF) is extracted from the internal carotid artery (ICA) region of interest. However, current perfusion DSA methods require manual annotation of the ICA. In this work, a supervised deep-learning model for semantic ICA segmentation was trained. Subsequently, an automated application was developed to generate perfusion DSA images. The results of quantitative statistics indicate that there is no significant difference between using the automated application that utilizes the AI segmentation model and the manual annotation method. These findings suggest that this application framework may offer important benefits in clinical practice and future research."
Maintaining parallelism in reverse-mode automatic differentiation on functional parallel array languages,"['Hus, Simon van']","['Keller, G.K.']",2023-10-18T23:01:01Z,EN,['automatic differentiation; tracing; parallelism; array languages; haskell'],Artificial Intelligence,"n this paper we set out to make a simple reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) algorithm, that uses tracing for the forward pass, and preserves data parallelism in the reverse pass. To do this, we first try to formalize the notion of tracing somewhat. We find that while some flexibility in the definition of is needed for it to work well, we can also boil it down to picking a subset of data types to keep in the trace. We also define a couple of logical assertions that further help us in showing whether a trace does really contain the information that we need. Having defined tracing, in theory, but also over a Haskell DSL, we continue to automatic differentiation. Here we expand the tracing function into a forward-pass function by adding reference counting and intermediate values. Using this forward-pass trace as a map, we then show how we can do the reverse-pass. We also show that we can keep data-parallelism intact for the map and fold (reduce) operations. Finally, we also highlight how task parallelism can be used in the reverse-pass to possibly unlock even more efficiency."
Youth Participation and its Integration Within Child-Focused NGOs that Target Low- and Middle-Income Countries,"['Buttigieg, Thomas']","['Groot, Tjitske de']",2023-10-18T23:01:14Z,EN,['Child Participation; Child Focused NGOs; LMICs; Implementation Measures'],"Youth, Education and Society","This study aims to examine the integration of youth participation within child-focused non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To answer this question, the study used a qualitative research design that included semi-structured interviews with 14 NGO employees (From 11 different NGOs). The data was analysed using thematic analysis. 
The findings show that interviewed NGOs all recognize the importance of youth participation. Most NGOs discussed the importance of pre-implementation measures such as training and sensitization before a project’s commencement. While all respondents mentioned forms of participation within their work, levels of participation varied from passive forms of participation such as informing children to child led projects such as children’s councils. Participation also varied according to the age and ability of the child. 
The study finds that a number of NGOs consult with children yet make the final decision themselves, thus it is recommended to further involve children by making them official stakeholders in the decision-making process. Furthermore, the prioritisation of sensitization which seems to be effective in LMICs can be recommended as a pre-implementation measure to also be used in western contexts where child discrimination is still prevalent. Lastly, specific guidelines need to be put forward to aid NGOs and practitioners in the proper implementation of participation for children with disabilities."
THE TRANSFORMATION OF A LOCAL FOODSCAPE DUE TO THE TRANSITION TO SHRIMP FARMING IN RURAL BANGLADESH,"['Berk, Daan van']","['Bayrak, Mucahid']",2023-10-17T01:01:42Z,EN,['Foodscape; shrimp farming; inequality'],International Development Studies,"A blue revolution has taken place in most of the developing countries in Asia. This can also be seen back in Bangladesh with the rise of shrimp farming. The rise of shrimp farming had effects on the farming practices in Bangladesh, there was a transition from rice farming to rice-shrimp farming or monocultural shrimp farming. This research focuses on how the transition to shrimp farm transformed the foodscape of a local rural community in Bangladesh. There is a lot of literature on shrimp farming and the consequences of it, but there is none that focuses on food.
The data for this research is gathered by doing fieldwork in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh qualitative research methods such as interviews, observations and pictures were used to discover how the foodscape was changed.
The interviews gave a clear image on the transformation in the foodscape. Salt water is a requirement for shrimp farming, this salt water was let in the area via a switch gate. As a result the area became salinized. Because of this, other crops could not grow anymore or grow in less amounts and with less quality than before. A landscape that was green before shrimp farming, became a ‘desert in the delta’. The local population got most food via self-consumption, but are now more dependent on the local markets. However this transformation in foodscape only happened for people who did not profit of shrimp farming. The profiters of shrimp farming had bigger lands for shrimp farming and also land outside the shrimp area. The area therefore has a two-sided foodscape. On the one hand, the people who lost their crops and became more dependent on the market and on the other hand, the people who made more profits than before and still could grow the crops that they grew before shrimp farming.  The main driver of change for this transformation in foodscape is the salinization. The most important indirect driver of this change are political and economic factors."

The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate that there is a connection between weather and emotions in Old English poetry that appears most strongly in five types of narratives. These narratives are exile, punishing floods, Judgment Day, sea storms, and paradise, and in each one the connection presents itself differently. This thesis also considers works from the Anglo-Saxon tradition in order to establish a stronger sense of the connection by comparing the Latin and vernacular traditions. The connection appears in four forms, with weather either causing emotions or emphasising the emotional tone of a scene, and emotions either instigating weather events or describing weather phenomena. A secondary objective of this thesis is to look at God’s emotional role in the narratives and how he controls or affects the weather."
"Social media, wat doe je met me? - De relatie tussen social media gebruik en depressieve gevoelens bij adolescenten met de mate van eigenwaarde als mediator","['Bakx, Lotte']","['Henricks, L.A.']",2023-10-18T23:01:06Z,NL,[],"Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Abstract
Adolescence is a vulnerable period for developing depressive feelings and low self-esteem. Previous research has shown that social media may play a role in the development of these aspects. Almost all adolescents today use social media. However, few studies have reported specific findings on social media use and depressive feelings in adolescents mediated by self-esteem levels. The current study examined this relationship with a research group consisting of 37 adolescents between the ages of 16-18. They completed an online survey via Qualtrics with questionnaires about social media use, perceived depressive feelings and self-esteem levels. The mediation analysis was done by using the PROCESS analysis technique. First, the results showed that there was no relationship between the frequency of social media use and depressive feelings. In addition, it appears that self-esteem did not mediate the relationship between the frequency of social media use and depressive feelings. Both were contrary to the literature and predetermined expectation. There are several limitations of the study. For example, one-time measurements would not accurately predict social media use, measuring total social media use did not give an impression of how adolescents use social media, the study group was small, and adolescent self-reporting was not found to be completely reliable. For future research, it is important to consider longitudinal re-examination with more participants in which a smaller aspect of social media use is measured more specifically."
Intelligence profiles of children with atopic dermatitis. Measured by the WISC-III.,"['Wagenaar, Lynn']","['Schappin, R.']",2023-10-18T23:01:04Z,EN,['Atopic dermatitis'],"Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as constitutional eczema, is a common inflammatory skin condition that causes itchy, red, and irritated skin. These symptoms associated with AD, such as itching, skin pain, sleep disturbances, and fatigue, can interfere with the mechanism behind executive functioning and the intelligence in children. Understanding the relationship between AD and intelligence is important for developing effective interventions and support for children with AD. This study explores the potential effects of AD on the intelligent profiles of children. To measure these relationships the WISC-III was administered to 55 children to measure their intelligence and analyze their intelligence profile. They were compared to a norm group based on the literature of the WISC-III. It was hypothesized that there will be peculiarities within the intelligence profile. The results show that no significant differences have been found in the total intelligence score and the processing speed. The results, however, did show a significant difference in score withing the verbal IQ and performal IQ. A significant higher verbal IQ score was obtained by the children with AD. Also 48.2% of the participants had a disharmonic intelligence profile. Preliminary findings suggest potential strengths and weaknesses withing the intelligence among children with AD, but further research is needed to establish more insight in executive functioning. Identifying cognitive peculiarities in children with AD can inform tailored treatments and interventions to optimize their treatment."
Phase slips in space-time crystals,"['Schokking, Jillis']","['Straten, Peter van der']",2023-11-02T00:00:46Z,EN,['time; crystal; BEC; Bose; Einstein; Condensate; phase'],Experimental Physics,"In this work, we attempt to find a suitable approach to study phaseslip switching between time crystal modes. These time crystal are density oscillations in Bose Einstein condensates. Our goal is to determine the parameter space in which dynamics between crystal modes arise, characterise this behaviour, and provide a basis for experimental work. Numerical evaluation of the Fokker-Planck equation requires a long evaluation time. Combined with the large parameter space of our system, faster running approximations are desirable. We focus on two models. The first method is the line model, an one-dimensional approximation to the Fokker Planck equation. The second is a quantum trajectory method, based on the the equations of motion of our system. We compare these to the (two dimensional) Fokker-Planck equation, evaluated using the MacCormack method.
The line model reproduces the correct equilibrium distribution at high number of quanta in the crystal, but fails close to the origin in the phase space of the crystal. We observe that flux current terms in the Fokker-Planck equation become dominant in this region, preventing probability flow between modes. This is further verified
by the dynamics observed using the other methods, the origin is always avoided. We conclude this model to be unsuitable. The quantum trajectory method becomes nonphysical in the limit of no damping, otherwise it reproduces the same qualitative behaviour as the 2d Fokker-Planck method. At higher noise levels we find both over and under-damped oscillations between crystal modes. Based on the 2d Fokker-Planck method, the type of oscillation depends largely on the detuning of the crystal with respect to the breathing mode. Both the frequency and damping parameters of the oscillations scale with the noise parameter. Additional simulations are required to verify if the quantum trajectory method produces the same scaling of the oscillation parameters. Even if this is not the case, the quantum trajectory method does provide a useful way to rapidly search
the parameter space. Experimental observation of a mode switch constitutes a π shift in the phase of
the time crystal, after the system is allowed to go unmeasured for some time. Apart from sufficient isolation, observation of mode switching requires control to some extend over the detuning and noise term. The first could be realized by changing the breathing mode frequency temporarily. The noise term needs to be two orders of magnitude stronger than experimental realisations so far. To this end, the influence of the thermal cloud on the noise term needs to be investigated. The parameter space of the driving parameters in which mode switching occurs, match that of current experimental realisations."
Applying the COM-B model to understand the (non) use of wellbeing indicators in policy development: what can we learn from civil servants?

In the Netherlands, efforts to move Beyond-GDP are largely synonymous with the adoption of brede welvaarts-denken (BWD), broad prosperity thinking. Evidence of BWD uptake, however, is limited and while efforts to move Beyond-GDP are growing internationally, the factors that influence the adoption of wider wellbeing measures in policymaking remain largely unknown. Applying the COM-B model of behaviour which highlights that Capability, Opportunity and Motivation are prerequisites to the performance of any given Behaviour, 23 semi-structured interviews with 29 civil servants, specialists and/or researchers were conducted in this study to: firstly, ascertain the (non) use of BWD in Dutch policymaking and secondly, understand the factors that facilitate or hinder uptake. Using inductive thematic analysis, 13 themes emerged as influencing BWD uptake, revealing a gap between a positive rhetoric surrounding BWD and its application in practice. Deductive coding of these themes to the COM-B model led to three main findings: 1) Most themes fell under the Opportunity stream, implying that widespread social and environmental change to governmental and policymaking structures is required for uptake to increase. 2) While many of the identified barriers and facilitators to BWD uptake were the same, some disconnect emerged across the profiles of participants. Therefore, greater communication between the relevant stakeholders involved in BWD is recommended. 3) The complexity of BWD means greater conceptual clarity is needed, and the barriers and facilitators from all COM streams require joint attention if added value is to be evidenced and application is to become institutionalised across all levels and types of policymaking."

It centred around the following research question: How did the events of the Tet Offensive shape and transform American exceptionalism within popular culture in the period of 1968-1972? The relation between the Vietnam War and cultural expressions is a source of historiographical debate and research about the subject often focusses on singular explanations. As a result, this thesis attempted to clarify this intricate interconnection by studying the effects on the Tet Offensive on different types of cultural sources, while also keeping social-political developments in mind. 
In order to answer the central question of this research, the concept of exceptionalism was divided into three distinct features in patriotism, individualism and perceived cultural hegemony. The evolution of these elements was studied in American films, music and literature. These methods provided ample means to reveal the effects of the Tet Offensive on popular culture.
The application of this research has shown that the efficacy’s of these elements developed in a dissimilar manner in the chosen time period. It depended highly on social-political context and the type of industry that was explored. One overarching statement that could be made however, is that the Tet Offensive had a profound impact on the evolution of all these elements within popular culture. It prompted musicians, film makers and authors to question the traditional notions of exceptionalism and consider the changing public opinion with regards to anti-war sentiment. Furthermore, it highlighted the need to examine ramifications of American foreign policy by exploring the narratives of communities that were affected by it. 
	As this thesis focussed on a specific time period, its limitations were found in its ability to study the development of exceptionalism in the post-Vietnam period. Further research about the enduring effects of the Tet Offensive on popular culture could strengthen the findings of this inquiry.""""]"

Equilibria densities are derived using a compartmentalised model. The short-term immunity coexistence regime is also studied through compartmental models, with analysis being conducted to: (i) influence of cross-immunity on strain density, and (ii) the densities of total infecteds and susceptibles, in addition to the chance of invasion of a new strain into an existing equilibrium. For the long-term immunity non-coexistence parameter regime, we obtain explicit approximations for the expected time between outbreaks."

"Human behaviours, emotions, and perceptions in human-wildlife interactions: a mobile app-based approach","['Felstead, Wiggy']","['Dorresteijn, Ine']",2023-09-01T00:03:20Z,EN,['Human-Wildlife Interactions : Citizen Science : Mobile Application : Emotion : Behaviour'],Sustainable Development,"Human-wildlife interactions (HWIs) are a fundamental aspect of human existence. The Netherlands is currently experiencing a resurgence of wildlife amidst the combined pressures of increased urbanisation, climate change and habitat conversion. The progressively limited space for humans and wildlife to coexist means encounters between them are becoming increasingly prevalent. While some welcome the successful conservation and rewilding efforts, others fear a rise in human-wildlife conflict. Current HWI literature suffers conflict bias, lacks multiple species insights, and overstates the influence of rational decision-making. HWIs encompass the behaviour of humans and animals in response to each other. Consequently, insight into the drivers of human behaviour is vital for mitigating conflict and promoting coexistence. While emotions and perceptions are thought to be influential, there are significant gaps in the current literature as to their influence. This study utilised citizen scientists while testing a mobile application prototype to record HWIs, a novel approach that enabled human behaviours, emotions, and perceptions to be recorded in near real-time.
This case study focused on two natural areas in the Netherlands used by recreationists and home to diverse wildlife species. The influence of animal species on human behaviour, emotions and perceptions, and the relationships between these variables was explored as well as the participant experience using a mobile application to record HWIs. Data on HWIs were collected by citizen scientists using the mobile app over six weeks. Pearson’s chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests were employed to test the effect of animal species on human behaviours, emotions, and perceptions. Heat maps were created to identify the frequency of specific emotions and perceptions for each human behaviour. Correlation analysis and multiple ordinal regression were used to test for association between human behaviours, emotions, and perceptions.
Key findings suggest that HWIs between recreationists and wildlife are overwhelmingly positive. Furthermore, animal species had a significant effect on human behaviour and perceptions, while human emotions were universally positive. Contrary to expectations, no significant relationship was identified between human emotions, perceptions, and behaviours indicating that the complexity and nuance of these variables were insufficiently captured with the chosen methodology. Qualitative analysis however provides a promising future avenue. The main implications for wildlife management involve communicating the positive nature of interactions to alter the current conflict-biased discourse. Lastly, this research provides a template for an innovative approach to further research into HWIs using a citizen science mobile app."
Risk factors for Tetracycline resistance gene tet(W) & Class 1 integron abundance in Dutch pig farms,"['Kim, June']","['Mughini Gras, Lapo']",2023-11-28T00:00:54Z,EN,['Antimicrobial resistance; mixed-effects regression model; swine farm; antibiotic-resistant gene; risk factor'],Health and Environment,"Antibiotic resistance is an undeniable public health threat. Humans, animals, and the environment are closely interlinked reservoirs for the transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and genes. Contacting domesticated animals is an exposure to human acquisitions of ARGs and mobile genetic elements, which can transfer via the food chain, indirect & direct contact routes. Farmers in swine farms are in a particular situation where they can acquire ARGs from their pigs. The study aimed to identify risk factors for tetracycline gene tet(W) and class 1 integron abundance in Dutch pig farmers. Data from 33 multiplier Dutch pig farms from 2011-2012 were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects regression modeling technique. This method was appropriate for exploring the association between farm risk factors based on the human questionnaire answered by farmers and the relative abundance of tet(W) and intl1 gene copies calculated and normalized from the qPCR on fecal samples of farmers and pooled samples from pigs. Tet(W) and intl1 data were analyzed separately. Descriptive analyses including t-tests on the relative abundance of tet(W) and intl1 depicted a decreasing trend in humans. The result of the two models indicated that the second sampling time (12 months) was associated with the decreased relative abundance of tet(W) and intl1 in humans. In the tet(W) model, self-administering antibiotics to pigs and living on the pig farm were positively and significantly associated with the relative abundance of tet(W) in humans. 
In the intl1 model, hours spent per week on washing sows and removing manure of weaner piglets were identified as significant farm risk factors. In conclusion, risk factors in the study indicated that there has been a combination of direct and indirect transfer of resistant genes from pigs to farmers. Longer exposure in hours to pigs is associated with a higher relative abundance of tet(W) in humans."

Research on CSA is critical as CSA endangers the well-being of children due to immediate emotional and physical trauma and high rates of physical and psychological health issues that can be traced back to assault. However, research on CSA in Africa, including Kenya, is considered problematic. UNICEF urges the development of a properly researched information base for African countries to gain a deeper understanding of the context, mechanisms, and dynamics of CSA. Sexuality education has proved to be a powerful tool sexual violence prevention. An approach that has gained popularity among human rights advocating organisations is the concept of comprehensive sexuality education (CSE). CSE can promote gender equality, foster critical thinking, strengthen capacities for citizenship, address vulnerabilities to fight exclusion, recognise the complexities of young people's lives, and be gender inclusive. However, abstinence-only education (AOE) is predominant in sub-Saharan Africa, which does not promote informed decision making. 

Therefore, this research addresses the question: What are the effects of sexuality education on children in Kenya? This question is answered through the lens of a case study intervention examining a niche intervention established by a Dutch NGO in Malindi District. By applying the theory of planned behaviour, it is analysed how community and students’ perspectives on gender equality, consent, and sexual abuse and harassment influence student display of protective behaviours against sexual violence. Qualitative data was gathered through participant observations and interviews. 

Findings show a strong focus on abstinence and other patriarchal influences in the programme. While the programme does affect the understanding of gender equality, consent, and sexual abuse and harassment, the messages conveyed are not in line with the critical values of CSE. Data revealed that even though AY SEP promotes gender equality, the reality is a culture ingrained with GBD and violence, which also influences the content of lessons. Consent is taught and understood in the context of abstinence, ignoring the reality of sexually active students in the community. This harms students' bodily and individual integrity and discriminates against abuse victims by devaluing them based on their chastity. With a limited understanding of gender equality and consent and no stimulation of critical thinking, students are not taught to challenge harmful traditions and beliefs or question stigma. In return, the programme does not address vulnerabilities to fight exclusion by not actively dismissing stigma but stimulating the latter. Even though the programme is gender inclusive, stakeholders tend to have an unbalanced approach to gender equality by overvaluing female academic achievement over male achievements. The programme does empower children to engage in protective behaviours but does not teach them how to exercise agency."
"UNDERSTANDING PROTEST DYNAMICS: SOCIAL IDENTIFICATION, PERCEIVED INJUSTICE, ANGER AND DISOBEDIENT PROTEST IN THE CONTEXT OF THE AMELISWEERD MOVEMENT","['Haan, Manoah de']","['Jansma, Amarins']",2023-11-28T00:00:51Z,EN,['Social identification; perceived injustice; anger; disobedient protest; \nAmelisweerd movement; collective action'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","This study examines the influence of social identification, feelings of injustice, and anger on 
the willingness of individuals to engage in disobedient protest acts within the Amelisweerd 
movement. This research aims to replicate a pathway of the SIMCA model proposed by Van 
Zomeren et al. (2008), specifically focusing on the perceived injustice pathway and 
incorporating anger as an additional factor. This is done by using a survey study approach 
with a sample size of N=50, consisting of individuals aged 19 to 74 years. The results 
indicated a significant association between perceived injustice and willingness to participate 
in disobedient protest, supporting previous research on the link between perceived injustice 
and collective action. The study did not find significant associations between social 
identification and disobedient protest intentions, contrary to the SIMCA model's predictions. 
Furthermore, the study revealed that social identification indirectly predicted legal protest 
intentions through perceptions of unfair police treatment. Consequently, individuals who 
strongly identify with the movement may be motivated to engage in legal forms of collective 
action, considering the perceived past unfairness regarding the police. While this study has 
limitations, including a small sample size and low statistical power, it contributes to our 
understanding of the perceived injustice pathway in collective action and highlights the 
importance of addressing subgroup differences within the Amelisweerd movement. The 
findings suggest that appealing to perceptions of injustice can be a valuable strategy for 
motivating collective action, and future research should further investigate subgroup 
dynamics within the movement."
Migration as a ‘European Problem’: The Discourse of ‘Europeanness’ in Migration Policy and News Articles in the European Union,"['Hierholzer, Rachel']","['Jeursen, Thijs']",2023-11-28T10:39:16Z,EN,[],Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"This research examines how the representation of migrants entering the European Union (EU) through the Mediterranean in European news articles reflects and relates to EU migration policy and the imaginary of a collective European identity. A critical discourse analysis of 18 European-based news articles from Euronews and Deutsche Welle between January and May 2023 was conducted. This analysis falsifies and problematizes the dominant discourses in these news articles and migration policies pertaining to Fortress Europe, crisis narratives, and what it means to be ‘European’ to highlight how discourse surrounding migration as a European problem purposefully racializes migrants and enables violence against them. The racialization of migrants highlights the role of biopolitics and examines how in the era of externalization and securitization of borders, the border has become more than physical and rather a practice reproduced through discourse. The framing of migration from a European perspective highlights the power of discourse to influence policy and public opinion, and showcases how the actions of the EU can trickle-down to exclusionary nation-state policy, highlighted by the example of Italian migration policy under its newly elected right-wing government. This framing and relationship produces a perpetual cycle of exclusion that is normalized and allows violence to continue unquestioned or be considered acceptable by the general public and within policy. The Europeanization of borders highlights a major juxtaposition between the image of the EU as a leading governmental body committed to democracy and protecting human rights and freedom, and their actions that enable violence against migrants."
Unraveling Grey Matter with Diffusion MRI: Challenges and Possibilities,"['Meinders, Stan']","['Luca, Alberto de']",2023-11-28T00:00:47Z,EN,['biophysical models; cerebral cortex; diffusion MRI; grey matter; tractography'],Medical Imaging,"The cerebral cortex is a grey matter (GM) structure in the brain that contains the vast majority of neurons. As such, it  plays an important role in the functioning of the brain. GM changes are also associated with several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite the importance of GM, there is currently a lack of methods able to provide non-invasive insights into its structure. Two emerging approaches might bridge this gap of knowledge by providing a complementary structural characterization of the cortex: biophysical modelling might allow to capture the microstructure of the cortex, whereas fiber tractography could reconstruct the spatial organization of fibers in cortical circuits. This literature review investigates the possibilities and challenges of using biophysical modeling and tractography to study the GM. 
Biophysical models try to resemble a non-invasive in vivo microscope. They describe the GM as a sum of microscopic compartments, and try to fit model parameters to the diffusion signal to obtain microstructural information. Preclinical results have been promising, but the development of clinically feasible acquisition protocols is challenging. Furthermore, current models are specific to healthy tissue, which makes the extension to pathologies challenging. 
The application of tractography to GM suffers from multiple unresolved challenges, e.g., limited spatial resolution, the gyral bias and the reconstruction of reliable fiber orientations. Multiple promising methods have been developed to overcome these challenges and are discussed in this review, but it will remain a challenge to combine these different methods to simultaneously overcome the different challenges. 
Due to a lack of a ground truth except histology, validation is often complicated for these two methods."

"Mirror, Mirror in the Brain, What’s the Interdisciplinary Interaction for my Domain: A description of the emergence of mirror neuron empathy as a case of neuroscience imperialism facilitated by disciplinary bridging","['Bouillon, Juliette']","['Wied, Minet de']",2023-12-08T00:00:49Z,EN,"['interdisciplinarity, empathy, mirror neuron empathy, social neuroscience, mirror neuron(s), scientific imperialism, neuroscience imperialism, history of social neuroscience, integration, philosophy of interdisciplinarity, social psychology']",History and Philosophy of Science,"My aim in this thesis is to describe the emergence of mirror neuron empathy as an important research program within social neuroscience through a suitable description of the interdisciplinary interactions that were constitutive of its history.  

As a discipline that defines itself in terms of interdisciplinarity between social psychology and neuroscience, social neuroscience follows a classical theoretical framework for interdisciplinarity, which I have termed CIPI (/Classic Integrative Picture of Interdisciplinarity). Because mirror neuron empathy is considered one of the foundational research programs of social neuroscience, the CIPI framework seemed to be an obvious candidate for its description in terms of interdisciplinarity. However, a closer inspection of the history of early mirror neuron empathy reveals that the scientific practice of the development of mirror neuron empathy is not consistent with the CIPI-ideal set out by its parent discipline. Firstly, contrary to social neuroscience’s self-concept, the early history of mirror neuron empathy was not characterized by a CIPI-style interaction between social psychology and neuroscience. Instead, the first theory of mirror neuron empathy was constructed by a transitory interaction with philosophy. Furthermore, early successors of this theory did not display interaction with any other non-neuroscientific discipline. Secondly, I established that this history is not only incommensurable with social neuroscience’s self-concept, but that it cannot accurately be described as a CIPI interaction at all. Briefly put, what happened in the practice of the development of mirror neuron empathy does not line up with the theoretical expectations about its interdisciplinarity. 

This inadequacy of CIPI for my descriptive purpose leads me to introduce an alternative, empirically based framework for interdisciplinarity, mainly based on Uskali Mäki’s work. This new framework attempts to close the chasm between theoretical notions of interdisciplinarity, and its manifestation within actual scientific practice. Using this framework, I introduce a new notion of ‘interdisciplinarity’ defined as a spectrum that contains a range of different subtypes of interdisciplinary interaction. One of the subtypes, namely scientific imperialism, I considered to be especially relevant for my case study. After distilling some descriptive tools from Mäki’s framework for scientific imperialism, I recount the early history of mirror neuron empathy through this new practical framework for interdisciplinarity while making use of the vocabulary of scientific imperialism. I described the emergence of mirror neuron empathy in two stages:

First by its transitory interaction with philosophy, which I term ‘disciplinary bridging’. Through this first step, neuroscience could bypass the discipline of social psychology in its first formulation of a mirror neuron theory of empathy, while still entering the social domain. Secondly, I claim that this bridging mechanism facilitated (neuro)scientific imperialism of social psychology within the domain of social neuroscience. I describe some of the details of early mirror neuron empathy using Mäki’s framework while connecting these observations to the bridging mechanism. This final description will lead me to claim that the emergence of mirror neuron empathy is best described using a practical framework for interdisciplinarity, which allows for its description as a case of neuroscience imperialism facilitated by disciplinary bridging through philosophy."
Predicting HLA ligands through a ubiquitination-aware random forest,"['Ligtenberg, Wessel']","['Kesmir, Can']",2023-12-08T00:00:45Z,EN,[],Science and Business Management,"In the realm of immunotherapy, identification of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands has an essential role. In the research described in this paper, we present a novel approach to predict HLA ligands by integrating the post-translational modification ubiquitination. The methodology involves the development of a random forest algorithm leveraging a combined input of ubiquitination data and results from existing prediction method netMHCpan. Ubiquitination-aware random forest performance was evaluated by benchmarking against existing prediction methods. Marginal performance enhancement of the method is observed in two distinct datasets; illustrating how ubiquitination might play a small role in modulating HLA ligand presentation, thereby influencing immune recognition. Therefore, the results hint that including ubiquitination in predictive methods may slightly improve identification of HLA ligands, but further validation is required. More surprisingly, our method performed well at HLA ligand prediction on the validation cell line, despite differing HLA subtype expression, indicating an unexpected wide applicability."

Design: Retrospective cohort study
Setting: Nationwide population-based study in the Netherlands 
Population: Women with FIGO stage I, low-grade EEC who received total laparoscopic hysterectomy between 2010 and 2020.
Methods: Patient data were identified from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Data regarding hospital manipulator preferences were retrieved through an online survey. Patients were categorized based on hospital manipulator preference. Survival analyses were performed using univariable and multivariable cox regression analysis.
Main outcome measures: Recurrence of cancer, disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), site of recurrence, and manipulator preference according to type of hospital. 
Results Of the total study population (N = 5,205), 1524 (29.3%) patients underwent surgery in hospitals that used non-IU manipulators and 3681 (70.7%) in hospitals that used IU manipulators. Recurrence of cancer was experienced by 195 patients, 49 (3.2%) in the non-IU group and 146 (4.0%) in the IU group. No significant difference in site of recurrence was observed (p=0.778). After adjusting for potential confounders, type of uterus manipulator did not affect DFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78–1.11) and OS (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75–1.09). 
Conclusion: IU manipulators are not inferior to non-IU manipulators with respect to oncological outcome in early-stage, low-grade EEC."
Chemical indicators for human exposure and risk assessment in wastewater,"['Tielemans, Onno']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-12-07T00:01:16Z,EN,"['Wastewater, chemical pollution, exposure assessment, risk assessment']",Health and Environment,"A concern arising from chemical pollution is that the environment, society, and large segments of the population may be at risk when chemicals enter the water and wastewater network as a result of anthropogenetic activities. This study investigates wastewater quality and its relevance for human exposures to chemicals, to use in risk assessment The research presented here answers the question: What information can sewage treatment plant (STP) wastewater provide on exposure and hazards of chemicals for human health and the environment? 

This study provides an overview of chemical micropollutants in the context of wastewater. In addition, a framework is proposed to identify potentially harmful chemicals in the wastewater system based on observed concentrations, hazard assessment, and exposure assessment. 

Chemical micropollutants in wastewater are studied to evaluate if they may pose a risk when reusing wastewater for purposes such as drinking water, agricultural production, and industrial production. Chemical micro pollution in wastewater flowing out of STP can result in direct and indirect human exposure. Direct chemical exposure from wastewater can occur during incidents or contact during effluent disposal. Indirect exposure is linked to the inhalation of substances when working or living near a STP; other indirect exposure may occur by the ingestion of food or drinking water irrigated by or produced from water that is impacted by effluent, respectively. 

Prioritizing the chemical composition of wastewater resulted in chemicals that could be harmful to humans when exposed to wastewater Chemicals such as per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, fungicides, surfactants, and antimicrobial agents are linked to possible adverse health effects from wastewater exposure. Exposure assessment is performed on PFOA, because of the current relevance. PFOA could be a high risk when exposure occurs through swimming in waterbodies connected to effluent or through consuming drinking water or food products. When consuming PFOA, the potential adverse health effect of PFOA from the tolerable daily intake (TDI) is linked to a reduced vaccine immune response.

Because of the potential increase of harmful chemical concentrations in freshwater sources (e.g., drinking water production and agricultural water) due to the increase in reusing wastewater. More strategies to identify areas where further research on increasing chemical concentrations and monitoring is needed to better understand the possible impacts of chemical exposure on human health."

This has the advantage that it describes multiplicative structures on spectral sequences in a categorical way. We apply these results to the Leray-Serre-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence. Given a fibration, this spectral sequence calculates the generalized cohomology of the total space from the cohomology of the base space with coefficients in the generalized cohomology of the fiber. Using this new approach we can show that the spectral sequence admits a multiplicative structure."

In our project we wanted to investigate if this assumption on how to implement the effect of clustering on the effectiveness of contact tracing is justified. Two models were created to simulate clustering in contact networks. The first model is a simplified version of the model used in the CoronaMelder study. In the second model epidemics spread on a clustered contact network to represent the process closer to reality. With these models contact tracing was simulated and compared."

The Role of Force Feedback and Vibrotactile Feedback in Learning and Retaining Procedural and Factual Knowledge in an Immersive Virtual Training Simulation,"['Vassallo, Monica']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-11-09T00:01:32Z,EN,[],Human-Computer Interaction,"Immersive Virtual reality (IVR) has been adopted for training systems across different domains.
However, its impact and effectiveness on learning are inconclusive and contradictory.
Based on the existing literature, implementing haptic feedback is one way to improve the learning
process in virtual environments for training (VTEs). To date, there needs to be more literature
on combining virtual reality and haptic feedback, aiming at increasing procedural and
factual knowledge retention. This study investigates whether vibrotactile and force feedback
can positively influence procedural and factual knowledge in VTEs and, if so, whether this
learned knowledge is retained over time. Guided by the ""Cognitive Affective Model of Immersive
Learning"" (CAMIL), this study examines the relationships among the interaction between
haptic feedback and VR, presence, and learning outcomes. According to CAMIL, increasing
presence and four key factors—interest, motivation, embodiment, and self-efficacy—through
haptic feedback will lead to procedural and factual knowledge retention. A between-subject
design employed the SenseGlove Nova and Oculus Meta Quest Pro in a virtual fire safety
training simulation to empirically test these hypotheses. Participants were divided into experimental
(HF) and control groups (NHF), with haptic feedback activation changing between
the two conditions. Both groups completed pre-training questionnaires assessing their prior
VR and haptics experience, knowledge of fire safety training, and existing procedural and factual
knowledge. Following the training session, participants completed a second questionnaire
about presence, interest, motivation, embodiment, and self-efficacy using the 5-point Likert
scale; questions that measured procedural and factual knowledge retention post-training were
also provided. Next, a follow-up survey was conducted one week later to evaluate knowledge
retention. In total, 70 participants were recruited, but only 68 (M = 24.6 years, SD = 27.5 years)
were considered due to the lack of two participants' responses after one week. Although no
significant differences were found between the experimental and control groups, the current
research shows increased retention of procedural knowledge through haptic feedback after the
first training session; likewise, participants could retain procedural information one week after
the training session. In the same way, there was no significant difference between the two
groups regarding the sense of presence and the three factors, except for embodiment, where a
significant difference was found. Finally, a positive correlation was found in the experimental
group between the sense of presence and motivation; presence was also negatively correlated
with the decrease of procedural knowledge after one week: increasing presence decreased the
decay of the said knowledge. In addition to these findings, motivation had a negative and significant
correlation with the same decrease in procedural knowledge retained after one week.
This finding has practical consequences and only partially answers the present study's main
research question. Several reasons can explain the lack of significant results. These include participants'
different learning techniques to memorise the information, the single try-out training
session, a sub-optimal training simulation, and problems during the experiments."

The research aims to determine veterinary opinions on this proposed legislation and explore alternative or supplementary strategies for addressing the challenges associated with stray cats. We used an online questionnaire to assess these opinions and a total of 260 veterinarians responded to 14 statements and we calculated distributions of responses and tested for significance with Pearson Chi-square tests. Most respondents expressed support for the proposed legislation on mandatory cat identification (75%; P<0.001), emphasizing its potential benefits for responsible cat ownership and the mitigation of stray cat problems. Furthermore, a significant majority of respondents (84%; P<0.001) opinioned that the benefits of this mandatory identification and registration outweighed the associated costs and that the veterinarian profession has a role to play in informing (potential) cat owners about the proposed legislation (81%; P<0.001). However, governmental support of the veterinary profession when informing these cat owners seems warranted as nearly all respondents (97%; P<0.001) indicated to opinion this is needed. Government may also consider making the veterinary profession leading in the registering of identification microchips, as our respondents indicated to a high degree (84%; P<0.001) the importance of their profession’s involvement in microchip registering, which may come with expertise and trustworthiness for cat owners as well as the government. Although our respondents seem to opinion generally uniformly regarding aspects of microchipping, their opinions on alternative and supplementary strategies for stray cat prevention seem more varied. An example is in the diverse opinions that emerged regarding the welfare risks of keeping cats indoors. Also, alternative measures’ support was more variedly distributed than the support for the proposed legislation on mandatory cat identification, with capturing and rehoming stray cats receiving the highest support among alternative measures (45%). This suggests that alongside the proposed legislation, the veterinary profession will support a multifaceted approach for addressing stray cat issues and can play an important role in increasing responsible cat ownership. The need for a multifaceted approach is underlined by only 1% of respondents opinioning that mandatory cat identification alone is sufficient to combat stray cat issues. Thus, a multifaceted approach and the role of stakeholders in such an approach warrants further investigations. How the veterinary profession’s involvement and governmental support can be effectively structured, with regard to for instance the provision of information to cat owners on the proposed legislation and potential future measures to combat stray cat issues, are interesting points to address in future studies."

collaboration, thus fostering trust within the human robot relationship is crucial. However, just as humans,
robots are bound to make mistakes and fail, with these failures leading to a violation of trust. Therefore,
research has focused on investigating how to repair this broken trust however results have been mixed.
Thus, in this work we investigate the effects of five communicative trust repair strategies (apology, denial,
explanation, compensation, silence) on participants' trust in the robot, following trust violations of two
different kin ds ( integrity based , competence based ). Additionally, the effect of the trust violations and repair
attempts on the perceived humanlikeness of the robot are measured. This is done by conducting an online
between subjects experiment, wherein participants are engaging in a collaborative task with the robot,
during which the robot repeatedly commits trust violating acts and responds with a repair me ssage. The
findings indicate the higher severity of integrity violations on moral trust and willingness to collaborate in the
future. Surprisingly, no differential effect between the two violation types on performance trust is found.
Moreover, the results suggest that a compensation leads to higher willingness to collaborate and higher trust
levels, whilst also resulting in lower discomfort ratings. This work contribute s to the ongoing effort of
understanding trust relationships in collaborative HRI contexts."

cell. The accessible parts of the DNA are called open chromatin. The closed chromatin is the part of
the DNA that is inaccessible. The closed parts of the DNA are bound to nucleosomes, the spool-like
proteins that keep DNA organized and compact. These parts are difficult to be accessed by any
proteins, and so they can not be reached by the proteins that transcribe DNA and make the cell
function as it does. The parts that are not bound to anything, the open parts, play an important role
in how the cell behaves. When smaller proteins than nucleosomes are bound to the DNA, this is
visible in the ATAC-seq results. These small proteins play a huge part in the behaviour of a cell. A way
of analyzing these small bound proteins in the ATAC-seq data is by doing a footprinting analysis. A
footprinting analysis could give a lot of information about the behaviour of a cell. When this analysis
is done on a diseased cell, information could be obtained about which parts of the DNA and which
bound proteins cause a cell to be diseased. This is valuable information for attempts to cure many

Fairness issues for users arise when the bias is responsible for varying levels of content quality for different user groups. Niche users, for example, might find popular recommendations less satisfying, although such recommendations are well-suited for mainstream-oriented users. Therefore, their satisfaction is directly linked to the popularity bias.
To investigate possibilities to mitigate the adverse effects of popularity bias, we develop a recommendation algorithm (RankALS) and employ popularity bias mitigation techniques. One aims at artist fairness (FA*IR), while the second focuses on user fairness (Calibrated Popularity). Through an algorithmic evaluation of the algorithms on the state-of-the-art music dataset (LFM-2b), we observe that the user-centric algorithm performs comparably to the base algorithm based on performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, NDCG) and recommends songs aligned with users' historical listening preferences in terms of popularity. This highlights its high user fairness. However, it retains an over-representation of popular items. Conversely, the artist-focused algorithm increases exposure for underrepresented songs, achieving item fairness, albeit at the expense of matching users' popularity-based listening histories and performances.
Particularly in exploration scenarios, lesser-known, unfamiliar songs might facilitate users' discovery of new content, improving their experience. To further investigate this phenomenon, we conducted a user study. Leveraging users' Spotify profiles, we generated personalized recommendations and applied mitigation algorithms. By means of questionnaires, we assess users' perceptions and satisfaction. 
The results show no significant differences in satisfaction between the algorithms. While user-centred fairness goals seem not to influence the users' perception, reduced popularity achieved by an item-fairness-focused algorithm was perceived by the users, and the accompanying reduced Familiarity with the recommendations can enable Discovery, the feeling that the recommendations enrich the user's musical taste. Discovery is highly positively associated with satisfaction metrics and behavioural intentions. While no direct impact of the mitigation methods on behavioural intentions could be made, we show that high satisfaction predicts behavioural intentions.
This research advocates for mitigating biases in music recommender systems for the benefit of item providers (artists) and users, avoiding unfair treatment of distinct user groups. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of mitigation algorithms at an unprecedented scale and investigate real users' perceptions of the outcomes. Lastly, we explore users' behavioural motivations toward engaging with more equitable content. We posit that generating fairer recommendations can achieve a lasting influence on users' consumption behaviours, promoting an overall healthier music consumption pattern."
Exploring the interaction between MemBright-488 stained human milk extracellular vesicles and gingival epithelial cells (Ca992),"['Verheul, Kai']","['Herwijnen, Martijn van']",2023-11-10T00:01:02Z,EN,['Extracellular vesicle; EV; microvesicle; exosome; human milk; hmEV; oral cavity; gingival epithelial cells; Ca922; low density lipoprotein; LDL; fetal calf serum; FCS; albumin; BSA; bovine serum albumin; flow cytometry; FACS; confocal microscopy; CLSM; QuPath; uptake; inhibition; milk; matrix'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"Breastfeeding supports the developing infant. In the oral cavity, extracellular vesicles in human milk (hmEVs) have been shown to interact with gingival epithelial cells. EVs are nanosized highly heterogeneous spherical particles with a bilipid membrane that facilitate intercellular communication through incorporated proteins, (small) RNA, and lipids. This report is a gathering of findings and learning points concerning the interaction between hmEVs and gingival epithelial cells. hmEVs of three donors were isolated using a combination of differential centrifugation, density gradient ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Isolated hmEVs were stained with MemBright-488 to make them detectable. Next to hmEVs, a negative control hmEV-depleted sample was made. This hmEV-depleted sample was made from the supernatant after the density gradient ultracentrifugation step. The supernatant was loaded on a new density gradient, ultracentrifuged, and further processed the same as was done with the hmEV samples. Gingival epithelial cells (Ca922) were cultured in MEM with Penicillin-Streptomycin, Ultra-glutamine, and Fetal Calf Serum (FCS). For experiments, a part of this cell culture was transferred to a 48-wells plate. These cells attached themselves to the bottom of the 48-wells plate overnight. After attachment, the cells were starved for 2 hours in plain DMEM. Then the medium was replaced and MemBright-488 stained hmEVs/hmEV-depleted were added and incubated with the cells for consecutively 30-, 60-, and 150 minutes. After incubation, the cells were washed and resuspended with trypsin from the wells bottom for flow cytometry measurements using the FACSCanto II. Confocal microscopy with the Olympus /Evident Spin IXplore SoRa was done to test the flow cytometry findings and obtain more specific information about the kind of interaction occurring between hmEVs and gingival epithelial cells. Initial experiments were performed in the absence of FCS in the incubation medium to replicate previously published experiments. Results of these experiments show a significant increase in MemBright-488 signal of the gingival epithelial cells during the first 3 hours of incubation with hmEVs (p < 0.0001). After those 3 hours, the signal stabilises. This suggests that the MemBright-488 stained hmEVs either attached themselves to- or were taken up by gingival epithelial cells. The latter was also confirmed with confocal microscopy. Additionally, incubation conditions including FCS were tested which showed a remarkable difference. When FCS was present in the incubation medium, significantly less increase in MemBright-488 signal was observed in gingival epithelial cells after incubation with hmEVs (p < 0.0001). While trying to identify the mechanistic difference of incubation with- or without FCS, the effect of BSA and LDL were tested. Incubation conditions including BSA showed equivalent results to those in absence of FCS for each of the three donors (p = 0.6322, p = 0.9813, p = 0.9316). Incubation conditions including LDL, on the other hand, showed results like with incubation conditions including FCS (p = 0.9947). From these findings it can be concluded that stained purified hmEVs increasingly interact with gingival epithelial cells during the first three hours of incubation, which includes uptake. The use of FCS in the incubation medium had a profound effect on this stained hmEV interaction. We measured the interaction of hmEVs on gingival epithelial cells in the presence of BSA and/or LDL and observed that especially LDL significantly reduces this interaction. This indicates that components of the milk matrix and FCS strongly affect hmEV interactions in vitro. Therefore, the use of FCS or other components in the incubation medium of hmEV interaction essays should be carefully considered."
Risk factors associated with the abundance of antimicrobial resistance gene tet(W) and class 1 integron (intl1) in pigs in the Netherlands,"['Jalencu, Emma']","['Mughini Gras, Lapo']",2023-11-10T00:01:21Z,EN,[],Health and Environment,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a substantial threat to public health in the 21st century. This research investigates the relationship between the abundance of antimicrobial resistance gene( tet(W) and class 1 integron (intl1)) and various risk factors related to tetracycline use, farm characteristics, hygiene, biosecurity, animal care, cleaning, planning, feeding and water supply, on Dutch pig farms. A longitudinal study was conducted on 36 pig farms, with samples collected at two time points, with a 12-month interval between them. On each farm, swab samples were taken from 60 pigs, who were then pooled by 6 pigs within the same age category. At the same time questionnaires were filled by veterinarians and farmers. qPCR was performed to quantify the abundance of tet(W) and intl1 along with the 16S rRNA gene used for the normalization of ARG copies. Associations between the abundance of antimicrobial resistant genes and different risk factors were assessed using a mixed-effects model. The results highlight the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing antimicrobial use in livestock. In the model covering all farms, it was determined that the use of early-life antibiotics, switching the piglets after the third day, and providing water via a nipple were significantly associated with the abundance of tet(W). These resistance genes were linked to the annual loss of sows, as well as cleaning and feeding procedures, in farrow-to-finish farms. According to our research, the annual number of piglets per sow and the existence of quarantine procedures were associated to the abundance of class 1 integron genes. While this study provides valuable insights into AMR in pig farming, cautious interpretation is advised due to its data-driven nature."

The human immune system has developed innate antiviral responses, including the cGAS-STING pathway, which recognizes cytosolic double-stranded DNA and leads to the expression of type I interferons. While STING expression appeared to inhibit the replication of a variety of viruses, it was shown to promote HRV replication. The mechanism contributing to the pro-viral role of STING in HRV infection remains unknown. Here we further elucidated the role of STING in HRV replication. We found that STING promoted HRV-A16 replication, but had no role in HRV-A2 and HRV-B14 replication. Furthermore, treatment with the STING antagonist H-151 did not affect HRV-A16 replication, whereas a STING autophagy mutant lowered its replication. We also isolated HRV-A16 strains that evolved to replicate independently of STING. Within these strains, missense mutations were found in the genes encoding the 2A and 2C proteins. Lastly, we aimed to establish fluorescently labelled human STING alongside a split fluorescent system for HRV-A16, to enable live cell imaging of their localization. Altogether, this report identified a crucial role for STING during HRV-A16 replication and a potential therapeutic target during HRV infections."

To investigate the above relationship, a cross-sectional analysis was executed. The data were collected with the use of questionnaires that were digitally distributed to 177 participants, 77 from Greece and 100 from the Netherlands. This thesis statistically evaluated the data by using linear regression with a moderator. The contribution to the scientific scene was by reaching to the conclusion that BNS has a mediating effect on hybrid meetings, however hybrid meetings have no direct effect on stress and engagement of employees, both in Greece and the Netherlands. The moderating role of digitalization was not as significant as expected, as it did not influence to a certain degree the relation of hybrid meetings with employee well-being, however the finding potrayed a strong direct relation of digitaliazation to stress and engagement. The findings of this research aid in creating a positive work environment for all organizations in Europe that nurtures employees’ holistic well-being"
The association between neighborhood walkability and cardiovascular diseases in older adults: a systematic review,"['Hoonte, Femke te']","['Vaartjes, Ilonca']",2023-11-10T00:01:25Z,EN,[],Epidemiology,"ABSTRACT
AIM: This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the studies  investigating the association between neighborhood walkability and cardiovascular diseases  (CVDs) in older adults. 
METHODS: PubMed was searched until 28 September 2023 for studies that met the  following inclusion criteria: (1) observational or experimental original studies, (2) reporting  some kind of composite walkability exposure measure, (3) reporting outcome data on CVD 
events or mortality due to CVD, (4) conducted in older adults (mean age above 65 years old and no adults younger than 50 years old included in the study). Only studies written in  English were included. Screening, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias was done by one reviewer. 
RESULTS: Five studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. Four out of five studies were assigned to
have a good quality, and one a fair quality. In three of the five studies, a higher walkability score was associated with a significant lower risk for CVD events, varying from a 22% lower risk for cardiometabolic mortality in older women (65-85 years old; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-0.97]) and a 6% lower risk for CVD mortality in older adults (65-74 years old; HR = 0.94 [95% CI 0.89-0.98]). Two studies did not find a statistically significant association. 
DISCUSSION: Although these results indicate a possible interaction between neighborhood walkability and CVDs in older adults, more research is needed to strengthen this evidence."

This gives rise to the famous diauxic growth curves. Since Monod's experiments which brought this process to light 80 years ago, the field has developed significantly. Today, CCR is understood as strategy which avoids unnecessarily protein production needed for the metabolizing secondary carbon sources when a more favorable source is present but other theories start to emerge. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of CCR differs significantly between different bacterial groups and so do the preferred carbon sources. This review describes CCR in four bacterial groups and highlights the yet lingering questions remaining in the field."
Antibodies formed during primary immune responses suppress germinal center quality upon boosting,"[""Wout, Marije van 't""]","['Heesters, B.A.']",2023-11-11T00:00:50Z,EN,['germinal center; humoral immunity; antibody-mediated feedback; influenza'],Infection and Immunity,"Upon exposure to foreign antigens, germinal center (GC) responses result in the generation of high-affinity plasma cells and memory B cells, providing long-term protection against infection. Re-exposure to previously encountered antigens typically results in faster and higher affinity antibody responses due to rapid differentiation of memory B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells. However, to generate antibodies against new epitopes, the generation of high-quality secondary, or ‘recall’, GCs is desired. Previous studies have shown that antigen-specific antibodies can suppress recall GC quality by blocking antigenic epitopes for naive B cells or promoting Fc-dependent antigen clearance. However, there is still a lot unknown about the effect of prior antigen exposure on recall GC quality and in particular the influence of pre-existing antibodies. By using prime-boost models for the influenza hemagglutinin protein, we show that B cells in recall GCs poorly bind to the immunogen. Recall GC quality could be improved by inhibiting the generation of antibody-producing plasma cells during primary immune responses, supporting the notion that antibody-mediated suppression is an important mechanism by which recall GC quality is reduced. Boosting with variant antigen partially overcomes antibody-mediated suppression, as seen by increased antigen-binding of GC B cells. Interestingly, when mice were immunized with SARS-CoV-2 Spike or hemagglutinin mRNA, recall GC B cells showed similar antigen-binding to primary GC B cells, indicating that mRNA vaccination induces recall GCs of higher quality than protein immunization. Lastly, we studied the contribution of recall GC B cells to serum antibody levels by using a novel ‘molecular fate-mapping’ approach, in which fate-mapping of immunoglobulin molecules in GC B cells allows us to differentiate between antibodies formed in primary and recall responses. We show that there is little contribution of recall GC B cells to antigen-specific antibody levels, even upon mRNA vaccination, while memory B cells from the primary response are potently engaged. In the future, these insights into the mechanisms governing recall GC quality can be used to improve booster vaccination strategies."
Deregulated splicing induces DNA damage and interferes with DNA repair in the hematopoietic system,"['Dreumel, Suzanne van']","['Boxtel, Ruben van']",2023-11-11T00:00:55Z,EN,['pAML; splicing; HSPCs; R-loops'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Leukemia is the most prevalent form of pediatric cancer, among which acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the second most common form of pediatric leukemia. Even though the overall survival rate increased over the past decades, still 1 out of 4 children with AML does not reach the 5-year survival after diagnosis. Even if the children survive, they often encounter severe therapy-related side effects. Recently, it was found that splicing is often disturbed in pediatric AML (pAML). This finding led to the question whether splicing deregulation is involved in the development of pAML, since splicing factor hotspot mutations are also frequently found in adult AML. In this study, we mimicked splicing deregulation by treating human hematopoietic stem- and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with the splicing inhibitor pladienolide B. In addition, we generated a DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) knock-out, since DNMT3A is one of the most prevalent mutated genes in adult AML and recently it was found that DNMT3A is also involved in splicing regulation. We observed an increase in double-stranded breaks and a major decrease in R-loops in splicing deregulated HSPCs. Interestingly, this decrease in R-loops is contradictory to the increase that was often observed in comparable studies with different cell lines. Future studies about splicing deregulation in the hematopoietic system can eventually contribute to prevent the development of pAML and stimulate the development of new targeted therapies."

Methods and Materials: The analysed data included 60 adults who participated in an online survey in Cyprus. In addition to demographic, data including terms related to music routines during lockdown, psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and quality of life were measured by using the Feelings of Threat and Uncertainty scale (FTUS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder-7 item (GAD-7), and generic Quality of Life Scale developed through the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-BREF). Results: No significant difference were found on the mental health between musicians and non-musicians. Correlation analysis revealed no substantial association between feelings of threat and uncertainty for COVID-19 and any mental health variable. This may suggest that the impact the pandemic had on the population mental health since the first lockdown (March 2020), may be moderate. For the second hypothesis, findings revealed that the musicians who stopped any practice during lockdown restrictions, significantly affected scores of depression. No significant comparisons were observed with other variables. Conclusions: Findings from the current study raise the importance of further investigating the impact COVID-19 had on population mental health. It becomes apparent that greater focus should be placed on artists who were forced to change their routines due to the restrictions."
The methionine cycle and folate cycle explored in mature erythrocytes,"['Veen, Lisa van']","['Jans, Judith']",2023-11-14T00:00:45Z,EN,['One-carbon metabolism; erythrocyte; methionine; folate; homocysteine;'],Biology of Disease,"The glycolytic pathway, the Rapoport-Luebering Shunt, and the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) are important metabolic pathways in erythrocytes. The glycolytic pathway is the main provider for energy metabolites and the PPP for the antioxidant metabolite, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Through these pathways the erythrocyte is provided with most of the energy and antioxidant metabolites needed for a 120-day survival. However, the erythrocytes metabolism goes beyond glycolysis and the PPP. Metabolomic studies showed that the one-carbon metabolism plays a role in erythrocytes. Here, a literature review is given about the one-carbon metabolism in mature erythrocytes to show the current understanding, to give insights into knowledge gaps, and to discuss future research implications. This overview shows that the transmethylation, transsulfuration, and the folate cycle play important roles in the mature erythrocyte. The main purposes of these three metabolic pathways are to methylate metabolites, and to generate antioxidants for balancing the redox level. Blood disorders often have a defect which involves or affects a part of the one-carbon metabolism, including haemoglobinopathies, enzyme deficiencies, and dietary metabolite deficiencies. These disorders point out the relevance of a solid antioxidant system through the methionine cycle and the folate cycle to maintain the redox balance and promote erythrocyte survival. In addition, regulation of the one-carbon metabolism in blood storage is of crucial importance for an optimal blood transfusion. Altogether, the provided overview of one-carbon metabolism in mature erythrocytes aims to aid in the further understanding of the erythrocytes one-carbon metabolism and its role in blood disorders, and blood storage and transfusion."

Background: There are several ideas on the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation (AF). One of the most common hypotheses is that inflammation may exist in the atrial walls of patients suffering from AF. Due to this 
hypothesized theory, we aimed to investigate the cardiac 18F-FDG uptake in patients with AF compared to patients without cardiac diseases. 

Methods: 82 adult patients were retrospectively enrolled. The cases (N=47) had a history of AF prior to the PET/CT scan. The controls (N=35) had no history of AF or other cardiac diseases. Both cases and controls used 
oral anticoagulants. Standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of the liver, heart, spleen and the psoas muscle were determined. The target to background ratios (TBR) of the liver, heart and spleen were obtained by dividing the 
targets by the background uptake (SUVmax of the psoas major muscle). 

Results: There was no significant difference in 18F-FDG uptake in the heart between the AF and control group (4.64 IQR: 3.06-6.59 against 3.71 IQR: 2.99-5.65, respectively; p=0,494). There was also no significant difference in 18FFDG uptake in the liver between the two groups (3.23 IQR: 2.72-3.91 against 3.40 IQR: 2.75-3.89; p=0.497). In contrast to the liver and heart, we found a significant difference in 18FFDG uptake in the spleen with a P value of 0.014.

Conclusion: This case-control study showed no significant differences in the cardiac- and hepatic 18F-FDG uptake between patients with AF and patients without cardiac diseases. A statistically significant difference in the splenic 18F-FDG uptake has been observed."

Reconstructed models represent a snapshot in time of an outcrop. Digital Orthophotos, 3D models, Surface Maps, 2D Vector files, and 3D Polygon maps are created by the geometrical alignment and reconstruction of thousands of high-resolution aerial and ground photographs. In this research, a Photogrammetry-based workflow is evaluated in multiple case studies on Shear Zones, Pegmatites, Aplite Dykes, and Diorite Enclaves within the Cap de Creus Peninsula in NE, Spain. The scope of this research is to assess the potential of these techniques to further our understanding of the deformation history of the study area and, in the process, develop valuable strategies and workflows to extract quantitative strain measurements. While the structural deformation history of the Cap de Creus area has been studied in detail, deformation on a mesoscale until today has not been possible due to technological constraints. Deformation markers and finite strain are extracted from the reconstructed models (XYZ) and orthophotos (XY) by applying specialized software that compiles the obtained data into a readable format, rose diagrams, stereonets, heat maps, and polar plots. These calculated datasets are calibrated and compared to field measurements to constrain the deformation conditions. Quantitative datasets are combined with high-resolution UAS surface maps to reconstruct and model the progressive deformation phases present at Cap de Creus. The resulting 2D maps and 3D numerical models represent a Geologist's best interpretation of the subsurface evolution of the late Variscan mountain-building phase in NE Iberia. This thesis demonstrates how UAS-SFM workflows can deliver high-quality results that compare and, more importantly, enhance traditional methods, enabling (i) the acquisition of larger datasets faster and more efficiently over a much larger area, (ii) Post-fieldwork quality control on field measurements, (iii) remove random human and equipment error, (iv) save valuable time during fieldwork by enabling base maps acquired in the field to be enhanced with digital measurements, enabling the Geologist to work more efficiently. The different case studies explored in Cap de Creus exemplify how powerful reconstructed field outcrops scaled to accurate world dimensions are and how they enable enhanced data acquisition in a digital environment and the ability to make and test new observations indefinitely. Digital maps of the Late Variscan Roses Granodiorite are compiled into 2D and 3D models with a Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) of 3.31mm/pix, enabling the acquisition of 1017 diorite enclaves and hundreds of intruded aplite dykes in just a few hours for quantitative strain analysis. This thesis also demonstrates the importance of using a concise and targeted approach to UAS-based mapping. Albeit mapping vast areas is possible, the resources required for reconstruction, the amount of data generated, and the negative impact on resolution constrain its usefulness in Geologic quantitative analysis. It is preferable instead to focus UAS mapping on a specific outcrop where visual markers are easily identifiable and can be used to quantify deformation. Quantitative analysis of the Late Variscan Roses Granodiorite provides new strain estimates for the mafic enclave deformation using the Rf - Φ method, 40% shortening under a close to three-dimensional homogeneous flattening and 50% shear strain of the retrograde greenschists shear zones which are in accordance with traditional and manual techniques for measuring strain. The ability to digitally measure a large population of stain markers furthers the precision and constraints on deformation."

Moreover, a distinction is made between emerging and developed countries. By challenging the natural resource-based view theory and neoclassical theory, this research aims to provide insights into the impact of environmental performance on financial performance. The hypotheses are tested on 458 corporations operating in sensitive industries from 2014 to 2022. Our analysis yields several notable findings. First, the results indicate that, in the overall sample, there is no significant relationship between environmental performance and financial performance. However, when considering the differentiation between emerging and developed countries, a positive EP-FP relationship is observed for developed countries, while a negative relationship is found for emerging countries. Furthermore, when incorporating clean technology as a moderating variable, a positive and significant association between EP and ROA is detected for the overall sample. Nevertheless, the presence of clean technology weakens the positive impact of EP on ROA. Interestingly, in the case of emerging countries, clean technology exhibits a positive moderating effect on the negative EP-FP relationship. Thus, clean technology presents a promising avenue for establishing a positive relationship between EP and FP in emerging countries. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of recognizing the distinct dynamics between developed and emerging countries in understanding the EP-FP relationship."

Therefore, this study aims to answer the question: To what extent does employee personality influence outcome, behavior, and people controls in their effects on job performance? An online questionnaire was sent out, where 114 respondents answered questions on their personality traits, on the use of  organizational controls of their manager, and on their job performance. Results suggested that none of the hypothesized relations were statistically significant. However, the results did suggest that the positive effects of people control are 
attenuated by a person’s level of conscientiousness. Furthermore, direct positive relations were found between 1) conscientiousness and job performance, 2) outcome control and job performance, and 3) intrinsic motivation and job performance. Based on this study, it is recommended that managers carefully consider interpersonal differences among its personnel when applying organizational controls to increase job performance."

MODFLOW 6, to evaluate the effect of ambient flow, dispersion, injection volume and uncertainties in
magnitude and angle of the flow velocity on the RE and optimized down-gradient well position.
Numerical modelling showed that the numerical optimized well distance closely relates to the analytical
calculated displacement distance for longitudinal dispersivities ≤ 0.5 m. At these dispersivities, ASTR
systems at optimized well distances, with ambient flow > 0 m/y result in higher RE’s compared to ASR
systems up to 60% of the total injected water volume. Smaller injection volumes with smaller resulting
hydraulic radii showed high sensitivity to edge effects decreasing both the optimized well distance and
corresponding optimized RE. Uncertainties in angle and magnitude of the groundwater flow decrease
the effectivity of the optimized well positioning and with that also the RE drops. ASTR systems are
potentially powerful systems to increase RE in regions with ambient flow. Their success is, however,
highly dependent on the accurate determination of subsurface parameters, such as direction and
magnitude of ambient flow"
Digital storytelling as a framework for a new narrative in museums,"['Santen, Marieke van']","['Lange, Michiel de']",2023-11-20T00:00:45Z,EN,['museums;diversity;inclusion;digital storytelling;online collectio'],New Media and Digital Culture,"In their mission to shed their past as institutions aimed at reform and educating the public on art, museums want to be more accessible, more diverse, and more inclusive. A mission they incorporated in their, in 2022 updated, definition of the museum. Critically exploring their role as the authority in the field, they aim at creating a new narrative in participation with multi-variegated communities. Building on the notion that this role is still embedded in the stories these museums tell, often displaying a linear art-history, this thesis looks at how a tool such as digital storytelling contributes to building these new narratives. By exploring two multimedia museum apps on their capacity for telling non-linear and more diverse and inclusive stories, the thesis explored how the apps contribute to the museums’ diversity and inclusion objectives. Two Dutch museums known for their digital innovation: the traditional national Rijksmuseum with a rich collection of Dutch art and the recently opened first publicly accessible Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen were selected. Both museums launched their multimedia app as tools which give the visitor a sense of being part of the collection and being more in control of the narrative.  Systematically analysing both apps by using the walkthrough method and a textual analysis, this thesis focuses on how some content and technical elements comply with the ideology but at the same time other content and technical elements in the app, as well as the infrastructure behind the apps (the collection database), cause the app to still display a rather linear art-history. This thesis claims that although the museums use their apps to present the user and work with the user towards a more diverse and inclusive storytelling, technical limitations in the apps and gaps in the digital infrastructure still display a mostly linear art-history with stories lacking in diversity and inclusion."

Cognitive support tries to alter the emotional interpretation of the experience through reappraisal. However, it could potentially invalidate the emotions of the sharer and strain the relationship. This study aimed to examine the impact of cognitive support on feelings of closeness after disclosing a negative experience, and whether this varied between the emotions anger and worry. It was hypothesized that cognitive support was related to decreased feelings of closeness, with a stronger effect for anger compared to worry. A total of 208 participants took part in this study, which involved real-life interactions and observed assessments of support provision. The results indicated that there was no significant relationship between cognitive support and reduced feelings of closeness. Furthermore, the type of emotion did not moderate this relationship.

Recognizing the potential negative impact of cognitive support on closeness can serve as a foundation for preventing relationship deterioration and fostering harmonious interactions."
The Enabling Power of Culture: The Effects of Myths of Creation on Cultural Practices and Green Energy Choices in Ecuador,"['Hattem, Yannick van']","['Namaganda, Emilinah']",2023-12-09T00:01:11Z,EN,"['Myths of creation, Culture of sustainability, Renewable energy, International Development Studies, Indigenous Communities, Ecuador']",International Development Studies,"ABSTRACT

Kimmerer (2015) exposed an intricate relationship between the Native Americans of the Great Lakes of North America and their natural environment. The author unveils a distinct difference between the culture of the Western world and that of the native inhabitants of North America by researching the myths of creation that are dominant in Native American communities. For instance, by establishing that sweetgrass, or wiingaashk, is honoured as one of the four sacred plants of the indigenous people. Among others, this plant is protected and preserved within their lands while simultaneously proven to be of importance in the studied myth of creation. In essence, she hints at an existing ‘Culture of Sustainability’ that can be linked to their myths of creation. A recent emphasis on indigenous literature and alternate forms of knowledge showcases the need for novel approaches to attain true reform within the sustainability realm. The concept of ‘inner worlds’ already proposes a convincing approach within this new movement, but additionally, other forms of knowledge are increasingly used to research climate change.

However, the opportunities that renewable energy provides are less extensively researched within this context. This thesis aims to embrace this recent shift in knowledge generation by studying indigenous creation stories in the Andean region of Ecuador. It examines whether and how such stories are told and subsequently examines how they link to sustainability concerns. These insights are used to explore the varying cultural practices affecting the relationship between the indigenous people and their environment. The possible presence of a ‘culture of sustainability’ is used to study the importance of an indigenous worldview towards sustainable concerns, and in particular to renewable energy.

Finally, this thesis reveals that myths of creation and the practice of telling them are becoming increasingly rare in indigenous communities in modern-day Ecuador. The continuous encroachment of indigenous people and their land sees traditional cultural practices fade. As a consequence, the sharing of traditional myths of creation seems to occupy a less prominent place in their traditions. However, the cultural practices that are said to be influenced by creation myths do hint at a distinct ‘Culture of Sustainability.’ Together with factors such as monitoring indigenous lands, viability, and long-term cost-effectiveness, a Culture of Sustainability can be regarded as influential in facilitating approaches regarding renewable energy."
Navigating Barriers to Adequate Vaccination Coverage: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and Post-Pandemic Strategies,"['Molendijk, Ian']","['Heesterbeek, Hans']",2023-12-09T00:01:35Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global vaccination programs through various non-pharmacological interventions and posed significant challenges to the administration of childhood vaccinations. This literature review examines the impact of the pandemic on vaccination coverage, emphasizing the decline in coverage ratios and the emergence of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles. It accentuates the importance of addressing barriers to vaccination, including cultural, social, and socioeconomic factors. For example, while higher education and income levels correlate with greater vaccination acceptance, lower educational and income groups only show more vaccine hesitancy but not a higher rate of refusal. Targeted education campaigns are essential to mitigate vaccine hesitancy and improve coverage and should not be limited to specific income or educational groups. This review also highlights the unequal recovery in vaccination coverage across regions and income groups, emphasizing the need for comprehensive strategies to ensure equity in immunization. Most regions returned to (almost) pre-COVID-19 levels of vaccination coverage ratio in 2022, however, when countries were grouped on gross national income, the vaccination coverage ratio of low-income countries was still declining in 2022. People-centred, locally tailored approaches, such as those employed by the GAVI vaccine alliance, offer potential solutions by identifying and addressing low-coverage areas. In the post-pandemic years, efforts to restore and strengthen vaccination programs are crucial, especially with the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases. The year 2023, which is deemed ""Big Catch-Up"", is aligned with the Immunization Agenda 2030 and aims to mitigate the pandemic's consequences and accelerate universal vaccination coverage. The experiences of past outbreaks, such as the Ebola outbreak, underscore the urgency of these efforts. To achieve the Immunization Agenda 2030's ambitious goals and to ensure ""no one is left behind"", collaborative efforts should be made to increase vaccination coverage and address barriers to immunization uptake. These important steps are necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of adequately protecting the health of children worldwide against vaccine preventable diseases."

thermodynamic and kinetic descriptions of the reaction. The model workflow
gains validity by being able to rediscover intermediates that were assigned

The findings indicate that a previously ‘unexpected’ lactone intermediate results
directly from a 1,3-substitution pattern on the reactant. This lactone is
instrumental in determining the product composition and selectivity towards a

beantwoorden van de onderzoeksvragen komen uit een enquête die is afgenomen onder 
inwoners van de landelijke gemeenten Kaag en Braasem en Oldebroek en de stedelijke

De resultaten tonen aan dat de basisgedachten over de Nederlandse identiteit niet sterk

echter een rol bij de mate van identificering met de Nederlandse identiteit, waarbij hoger 
opgeleiden zich hiermee minder sterk identificeren. Laagopgeleiden in stedelijke gemeenten 
identificeren zich minder met de Nederlandse identiteit dan laagopgeleiden in landelijke

werden omgekeerde vlaggen meer geaccepteerd als vorm van maatschappelijk protest, maar 
ook sterke tegenstanders van de omgekeerde vlag zijn woonachtig in deze gemeenten. Aan de 
hand van het lokale debat over de omgekeerde vlag kan geconcludeerd worden dat de 
omgekeerde vlaggen gezien worden als een vorm van heet nationalisme in landelijke

Farming and Flooding,"['Aalst, Nini van']","['Noorloos, Femke van']",2023-12-09T00:01:08Z,EN,"['citizen participation, flood mitigation, hydrosocial cycle, Dutch Delta, Vietnamese Mekong\nDelta, farmer adaptation, soft approaches, ecological turn']",International Development Studies,"This thesis explores citizen participation in flood mitigation projects within the Dutch Delta and the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. The main objective is to understand how farmers have adapted to and influenced flood mitigation initiatives in these regions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with local farmers and experts to gather data and insights. As climate change intensifies flood risks, finding alternative solutions is crucial. In flood management, there has been a paradigm shift from ‘the fight against floods’ towards ‘letting water in sometimes’. This research uses the hydrosocial cycle as a theoretical lens and analyses society and water as interconnective. The results of this research suggest that differences in context explain the different ways of dealing with floods, flood mitigation projects and participation. 

In the Vietnamese context, farmers do not implement the 3-3-2 cycle, a flood mitigation project, in large numbers. The 3-3-2 cycle fails to understand the little benefits that rainwater provides soil for the farmers. Farmers in this delta also receive little to no financial compensation in case of damage. Farmers in this area thus have to create and use their own flood protection measures, such as low dykes, floating rice cultivation and stilt houses. The solutions used in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta are characterised by being low-cost, quick and flexible. 

In the Dutch context, farmers have been part of a participatory program that left them with little choice but to work together. Farmers have created their own solution for flood mitigation, the so-called terp plan. This solution was long-stretched and high-cost. The polder is estimated to flood once every 25 years. Therefore, the effect on the ecology is minimal. This research underscores the importance of citizen participation and need for local knowledge in order to create better and more inclusive policies, which might ultimately lead to greater resilience in the future of flooding challenges."

However, many transgender people use hormones informally at some point during their transition. This practice is believed to be the result of the long waiting times for trans healthcare, but little is known about how self-medication is organized in the trans community.
 
In this thesis, I record self-medication practices among trans people in the Netherlands from the perspective of people who engage in them. Using seven semi-structured interviews, I show some of the organizational structures shaping self-medication, as well as people’s motivations for making use of it. 

In Chapter 1, I follow one person’s transition path, to show that they have often relied on the trans community for care that was unavailable through the conventional healthcare system. In Chapter 2, I give a more general outline of what types of information and care are exchanged within the trans community: from online forums where people share experiences to organized groups who give practical transition help. I also show how trust is formed in these different contexts. In Chapter 3, I describe the ideal trans healthcare system as envisioned by my interviewees. I argue that they are mainly looking for care as defined by Annemarie Mol, which the current healthcare system is ill-suited to provide. A strong informed consent model could be an alternative worth exploring."

This process is reconstructed using local newspaper articles written at the time, as well NGO reports, analyzed through a synthesis of rational choice theory and structurationism. The Cambodian state overcame the barriers to negotiated settlement using a three-pronged approach to commitment issues: first, it addressed state weakness, mainly through military integration, to resolve the security dilemma faced by potential KR defectors; building on this foundation of security, the RG then moved to incentivize long-term adherence to the conditions of integration by offering KR power brokers a political-economic stake in Cambodia’s post-conflict development; finally, discourse and the establishment of mutual understanding between former combatants contributed to the institutionalization of “national unity”."

medicine for antimicrobial stewardship implementation in companion animal
practices in the Netherlands","['Wessel, Mariken van']","['Broens, Els']",2023-12-19T00:00:44Z,EN,[],Health and Environment,"Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is currently among the biggest threats to healthcare. To reduce AMR, it is necessary to limit the selective pressure of antimicrobial usage (AMU) leading to AMR. To achieve this, there is an emerging interest in Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs). Research in human medicine has yielded positive results in the design and implementation of ASPs. To help implement, improve and evaluate the effectiveness of ASPs, Quality Indicators (QIs) that measure the quality of AMU are used in human medicine. Companion animal medicine also contributes to the development of AMR and therefore there is an emerging interest in ASPs for this sector. Currently, ASPs are not routinely implemented and QIs are not developed for companion animal practices. Therefore, this literature review investigates which QIs for antimicrobial stewardship, derived from human medicine,
can contribute to the implementation of ASPs in companion animal practices in the Netherlands.

To address this research gap, literature research was conducted using the PubMed and Web of Science databases. This has led to an overview of QIs and associated themes for ASPs used in hospitals and general practices (GPs) in human medicine. In addition, core elements for ASPs with associated challenges in companion animal practices have been identified.

Subsequently, QIs were identified that can contribute to the implementation of ASPs in companion animal practices. There are currently no QIs that are directly applicable to companion animal practices in the Netherlands. However, QIs that have the most potential to be applied first in companion animal practices, are drug- and disease-specific QIs that are used in GP. Other QIs are too advanced or complex or not applicable in companion animal practices. Future research should focus on ways to take the hurdles that currently hinder the adaptation and implementation of the drug- and disease-specific QIs into ASPs for companion animal practices."

The development of SG research is dominated by a homogenous community of Western actors and the proliferation of uneven research raises concerns for critical climate justice given the exclusion of a plurality of interests, values, and norms in the formulation of the research landscape and the construction of SG as a socio-technological imaginary. While commitments to critically investigate the positionalities and subjectivities shaping the knowledge grow more numerous, less explicit investigations exist that expose the ways in which the current discourse normalizes climate imaginaries that belong to a singularly Western tradition of thought. This research seeks to expose the ways in which the current epistemic climate engineering community totalizes a Western imaginary and thus entrenches discursive and material forms of ‘climate coloniality’. Using a decolonial analytical frame to construct and interpret a critical discourse analysis, I examine the most prominent (powerful) scientific literature on SG and its governance for the presence of narratives that institute climate coloniality. The findings reveal those dominant discourses within the field that totalize Western conceptions of climate change, earth, the role of science, the future, and humanity. By naming the genealogy of these discourses in Western modernity, the research challenges their universality that currently obscures colonial histories, reduces complexities, enables certain justifications, and reifies power imbalances. The research emphasizes the limitations of this investigation as situated and partial in its subjective and limited application of decolonial theoretical praxis, emphasizing the need for further research on climate
coloniality that is critical of this research and its intended contributions."
"The conditions a circular business model should meet to contribute to lowering environmental impacts in the IT sector, in comparison to a linear business model","['Houten, Laurien van']","['Tunn, Vivian']",2023-12-15T00:00:45Z,EN,['Circular business model; circular economy; LCA; Life Cycle Assessment'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Globally, 54 million tonnes of e-waste are produced each year. This amount is rapidly growing, as global access to digital technology is expanding. The disposal of e-waste contributes to a range of environmental impacts, such as globally increasing amounts of greenhouse gases, extraction of rare metals and minerals and leaching of toxic substances.
Transitioning towards a Circular Economy (CE) has been put forward as a solution to these increasing global pressures. A shift towards the CE can be operationalized through Circular Business Models (CBMs). CBMs that involve refurbishment and leasing are commonly employed within the IT sector. However, the effective sustainability advantages that occur as a result of the  CE and CBMs remain ambiguous in academic literature. Therefore, this research explores the conditions that allow CBMs offering a laptop to have a lower environmental impact than a Linear Business Model(LBM). 
This was evaluated based on case studies of three different CBM implementations and one LBM Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) were performed to determine the environmental impact of each case study.
The results showed that a CBM can have a lower environmental impact than a LBM under the right conditions. Furthermore, the production phase of a laptop was determined to be an environmental impact hot spot within its life cycle. The production phase was also the sole lifecycle phase that showed results, in terms of changes in environmental impacts, that were different in practice to the expected outcome based on CBM Theory. 
This research established that to ensure that a refurbishing and leasing CBM has a lower environmental impact than a LBM, the decrease in environmental impacts that result from the CBMs’ production phase should offset the additional environmental impacts that occur due to extra services and transport that are integral to the CBM. This can be achieved through the implementation of measures that facilitate lifetime extension, such as an increased lease contract duration or refurbishment rate. Additionally, interventions to keep environmental impacts of the service and transport phases to a minimum were formulated."

Nevertheless, a large number of individuals do not respond or have a long-lasting response. Tumor infiltrating T cells indeed can exhibit a wide range of dysfunctional states, referred to as exhaustion. This exhausted state is thought to be an important contributor in non-response to immune checkpoint inhibition. On top of chronic antigen stimulation, many suppressive elements present in the tumor microenvironment influence T cell progression to exhausted states. Studies in murine systems and on human tumor samples have thus far brought insight into the mechanisms inducing- and influencing progression of exhaustion in the T cells. In this study, we present a provisional human model for in vitro T cell exhaustion. In this model, we show upon activation with T cell receptor stimulating beads that CD8+ T cells express hallmark surface receptor PD-1 and key transcription factor TOX. Additionally, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells express other inhibitory receptors. Furthermore, expression of Eomes is revoked upon stimulation, indicating that the T cells display intermediate substages of exhaustion. Taken together, T cell receptor stimulation with beads can partially mimic T cell exhaustion in a model which can be used and optimized to further investigate effects of the tumor microenvironment on T cell activation and exhaustion, and how this may be contributing to immunotherapy response."

Finding relevant biomarkers is difficult because molecules secreted by the cell types involved in neurodegenerative diseases are often diluted and unstable in body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid and blood. For this purpose, extracellular vesicles (EVs) may be of use. EVs are small particles that are comprised of a membrane which envelops cell-derived biomolecules. EVs are secreted by all cell types, and cargo found in EVs varies according to their origin. EV cargo may reflect the pathological state of central nervous system (CNS) specific cell types in neurodegenerative diseases. EVs from CNS specific cell types can be isolated from body fluids, making EVs a promising tool to detect pathological changes in 
neurodegenerative diseases.
This review explores the present evidence for the use of extracellular vesicle cargo as potential biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. Evidence is revised on several disease-associated proteins and RNAs that may be used to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases and monitor disease progression during clinical trials. Further validation and standardization are needed."

Good medication adherence is necessary to lower disease activity and elongate periods of remission. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of the smartphone application MedicijnWijs on adherence to azathioprine therapy in IBD patients aged 12 up to and including 17 years old. The effect on knowledge about IBD and the ease of use of MedicijnWijs were studied as well.

Methods: A multicenter before-and-after study was conducted in three top clinical hospitals in the Netherlands. The participants used MedicijnWijs for six weeks. At the beginning and the end of the study, participants filled in two validated questionnaires: the Medication Adherence Report Scale-5 (MARS-5), which tested the participants’ adherence to azathioprine therapy, and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Knowledge Inventory Device 2 (IBD-KID2), which tested the participants’ knowledge about IBD. Potential changes in the scores compared to baseline were assessed. The ease of use of MedicijnWijs was assessed separately at the end of the six-week period.

Results: An interim analysis of the data of the Máxima Medical Center (MMC) cohort was conducted, since the total dataset was not yet available at the time of analysis due to delays in the other two hospitals. Seven participants were included between March 2022 and April 2022. The geometric mean age was 15.6 years old (IQR = 15.0-17.0), four participants (57.0%) were female, two (28.6%) had Ulcerative Colitis (UC), three (42.8%) Crohn’s Disease (CD), and two (28.6%) IBD unclassified (IBD-U). Two participants were lost to follow-up. The required sample size for generating a power of 80% was not achieved (only 7 out of 21 participants; 33.3%). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a non-significant difference in the MARS-5 score before (geometric mean = 23.0, IQR = 22.5-23.5) and after the use of MedicijnWijs (geometric mean = 23.2, IQR = 22.5-24.0); Z = -0.272, P = 0.785. Time since diagnosis was significantly positively correlated with the MARS-5 score at baseline (r = 0.894, P = 0.041). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a non-significant difference in the IBD-KID2 score before (geometric mean = 7.9, IQR = 6.0-11.0) and after the use of MedicijnWijs (geometric mean = 9.2, IQR = 6.5-12.5); Z = -0.730, P = 0.465. No other independent variable was significantly associated with the MARS-5 or IBD-KID2 scores of the participants. Overall, the ease of use of MedicijnWijs was rated high.

Conclusions: No hard conclusions can be drawn from the study since most results were not statistically significant. Overall, positive trends were observed in improving adherence to azathioprine therapy and knowledge about IBD. In the remainder of the study, the potential of MedicijnWijs will be further investigated in a multicenter setting."
What is Welfare?

Despite numerous academic courses and equestrian bodies offering equine education, a knowledge gap persists, often attributed to the absence of comprehensive welfare education for non-academic horse enthusiasts. To address this, the Stichting Rijvaardigheidsbewijzen Ruiter en menner (SRR) has commissioned an equine welfare certificate, the PaardenWelzijnsBewijs (PWB), aiming to impart fundamental knowledge for safeguarding equine welfare. While existing literature broadly captures equine welfare concerns, research focused on Dutch horse enthusiasts is sparse. This thesis employs qualitative methods to identify what horse enthusiasts in the Netherlands consider essential for equine welfare. 
Methods: A digital survey comprising open questions on equine husbandry, riding, and handling was disseminated via social media and the SRR network. Survey data were analysed qualitatively using thematic coding and quantitatively using Chi-squared tests.
Results/discussion: The survey received 875 complete responses, resulting in a 74.0% completion rate (875/1181). The majority of respondents were female (85.9%) and fell within the age groups of 35-44 (23.4%) or 45-54 (28.7%). Thematic analysis led to the identification of three major themes: Equine Husbandry, Human-Horse Interaction, and Equitation. Equine Husbandry was more frequently mentioned, suggesting its importance over training or interaction aspects to horse enthusiasts. Within this broad theme, subthemes like the ability to perform natural behaviour and feeding were most prominent. On the theme of Human-Horse Interaction, respondents highlighted the importance of understanding horse behaviour and human-horse communication to ensure their welfare, as well as ethical considerations for treating horses as sentient beings deserving respect. On the theme of Equitation, training of the rider and of the horse were mentioned most frequently, as well as knowledge of tack and equipment. Respondents emphasised the importance of qualified instruction on subjects of horse care and welfare. Quantitative analysis revealed significant differences across the variables of gender, age, and type of involvement with various subthemes related to horse husbandry, interaction, and training. Women and younger age groups were more likely to discuss the subthemes natural behaviour, feeding, and training of the horse. 
Conclusion and implications: This study revealed three main areas of interest to Dutch horse enthusiasts regarding equine welfare: Equine Husbandry, Human-Horse Interaction, and Equitation, with the greatest emphasis on husbandry practices. Despite evident awareness of a wide variety of welfare aspects among equestrians, a gap between knowledge and practice persists, pointing to the need for research to facilitate better application of welfare principles. The insights in this study can be used to further research into horse enthusiasts’ behaviour concerning equine welfare."
Het lot van de onherroepelijke volmacht na overlijden,"['Heijnen, Rud']","['Biemans, Jan']",2023-11-30T00:01:14Z,NL,['onherroepelijke volmacht; volmacht bij overlijden; oneigenlijke uiterste wilsbeschikking; gesloten stelsel uiterste wilsbeschikkingen'],Notarieel recht,"In deze scriptie is door bestudering van de parlementaire geschiedenis, rechtspraak en rechtsliteratuur onderzoek gedaan naar de doorwerking van een onherroepelijke volmacht in het erfrecht na het overlijden van de volmachtgever. Hierbij is ook aandacht besteed aan het gelsoten stelsel van uiterste wilsbeschikkingen.

Na de inleiding werd in het tweede hoofdstuk de totstandkoming en de achtergrond van de onherroepelijke volmacht behandeld. Daarbij kwam naar voren dat eend belangrijke reden voor het invoeren van de onherroepelijke volmacht de behoefte vanuit de praktijk was. Verder is gebleken dat de wetgever vond dat de onherroepelijke volmacht niet onbeperkt mogelijk moest zijn. Vandaar dat het beperkende belang- criterium is ingevoerd. Vervolgens kwam de wetgever tot de conclusie dat het terrein van de onherroepelijke volmacht aanzienlijk ruim werd in het nieuwe recht en heeft daarom aan de rechter een wijzigingsbevoegdheid toegekend. Het antwoord op de vraag wat is een onherroepelijke volmacht luidde in paragraaf 2.5 als volgt: de onherroepelijke volmacht is een zekerheidsrecht ten behoeve van de gevolmachtigde en/of een derde verpakt in een vertegenwoordigingsbevoegdheid. Het eerste hoofdstuk is afgesloten met een korte behandeling van de beëindigingsgronden van de onherroepelijke volmacht, waarbij alvast vooruitgewezen werd naar paragraaf 4.4.
In het derde hoofdstuk kwam de juridische techniek achter de vertegenwoordiging door de onherroepelijk gevolmachtigde na het overlijden van de volmachtgever aan bod. Hierbij is ook weer gekeken naar de totstandkomingsgeschiedenis van de wettelijke regeling inzake de onherroepelijke volmacht. Daarbij kwam naar boven dat de gebondenheid van de erfgenamen verklaard wordt door de onherroepelijke volmacht als zekerheidsrecht. Toen volgde een analyse van de juridische technieken achter de vertegenwoordigingsbevoegdheid van de executeur, de testamentair bewindvoerder en de vereffenaar en is geconcludeerd dat deze erfrechtelijke vertegenwoordigers de erfgenamen rechtstreeks vertegenwoordigen. Tenslotte is geconcludeerd dat de kunstmatige vertegenwoordigingsbevoegdheid van de onherroepelijk gevolmachtigde (art. 3:77 BW) ervoor zorgt dat de onherroepelijk gevolmachtigde bij zijn handelen binnen de grenzen van de volmacht de overleden erflater vertegenwoordigt.
De conclusies die getrokken zijn in hoofdstuk 3 waren ook de uitgangspunten voor hetgeen besproken is in het vierde hoofdstuk. In dat hoofdstuk kwam naar voren dat het beheer van een eventuele executeur, eventuele testamentair bewindvoerder of de erfgenamen zelf niets afdoet aan de bevoegdheden van de onherroepelijk gevolmachtigde. Daar kwam bij dat het beheer van de erfrechtelijke vertegenwoordigers en de erfgenamen niet op oneigenlijke wijze doorkruist kan worden door het handelen van de onherroepelijk gevolmachtigde. De achtergrond hiervan is dat de erflater bij leven zelf de onherroepelijke volmacht verleend heeft. Het is dan niet meer dan logisch dat zijn erfgenamen (en/of de erfrechtelijke vertegenwoordiger die hen vertegenwoordigt) ook gebonden zijn aan de onherroepelijke volmacht. Het zekerheidsrecht van de onherroepelijk gevolmachtigde of de derde in wiens belang de volmacht verleend is, dient gerespecteerd te worden. Echter, er is ook geconcludeerd dat het individuele belang van de gevolmachtigde of de derde soms dient te wijken voor het belang van de gezamenlijke schuldeisers. Dit heeft de wetgever al geconcludeerd bij het invoeren van de (onherroepelijke) volmacht. In het geval van een faillissement kan een volmacht namelijk niet doorwerken. De openbare orde en het belang van een ordentelijke afwikkeling van een insolvent vermogen vragen dan om centralisatie van bevoegdheden bij één persoon en dat is de curator. Sinds de invoering van het nieuwe erfrecht kunnen nalatenschap niet meer failliet gaan.

Improved Noise Reduction with NORDIC PCA for Submillimetre BOLD fMRI via Non-Local Patch Formation using Voxel Similarity Matching ‘Voxel-Matching (VM) NORDIC’,"['Nigi, Alessandro']","['Siero, Jeroen']",2023-12-01T00:01:35Z,EN,"['image processing, fMRI, submillimeter, mesoscale, thermal noise, noise, tSNR, smoothness']",Medical Imaging,"Submillimeter functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal enables the study of brain function at the submillimeter level, uncovering insights into fine-scale organizations like cortical layers and columns. However, its inherently low contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) often limit its reliability and applicability. Noise Reduction with Distribution Corrected Principal Components Analysis (NORDIC PCA) is a locally low-rank denoising algorithm that reduces thermal noise levels in BOLD fMRI in a local patch manner. However, local patches often contain a mixture of signals from multiple tissues that negatively affect the low-rank structure of the patches, which limits the denoising capabilities of the algorithm. We propose an alternative approach for patching formation by gathering similar non-local voxels, dubbed voxel-matching (VM) NORDIC. The results on submillimeter resolution BOLD fMRI data indicate that VM-NORDIC effectively promotes the low rankness of the patches by boosting signal redundancy, allowing for more efficient noise attenuation. Moreover, the method barely affects spatial smoothness due to the non-local voxel selection. In particular, VM-NORDIC outperforms NORDIC with default local patching (Standard-NORDIC) in terms of temporal SNR (tSNR) (~9-90% larger than Standard-NORDIC; ~23-250% than the original) and spatial smoothness estimates (~20% of the smoothness induced by Standard-NORDIC). These improvements are fundamental to improving the validity and precision of fMRI studies at submillimeter resolutions."
Exploring the effects of the grow factor BMP-9 on articular cartilage-derived progenitor cells to enhance articular cartilage regeneration,"['Bach González, Ona']","['Levato, Riccardo']",2023-12-01T00:01:31Z,EN,[],Science and Business Management,"Articular cartilage lacks intrinsic repairing potential, thus, osteochondral lesions might develop
degenerative and lasting defects. These defects lead to pain and disability in young adults, and
when these are left untreated, they can develop into early Osteoarthritis (OA). To overcome this
problem, cell therapies offer healing and functional replacement of the damaged tissue. In the
regenerative medicine field, chondrocytes and Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have previously
been studied to regenerate the articular cartilage. Recently however, Articular Cartilage
Progenitor Cells (ACPCs), a sub-population of chondrocytes, have emerged as an alternative to
use in these therapies. Choosing the medium conditions and the correct growth factors, in order
to enhance the chondrogenic potential of these cells, has been a major challenge within this field.
In contrast with previous studies which used growth factors such as Transforming Growth Factor
Beta-1 (TGFβ1) and different Bone Morphogenic Proteins (BMPs), this project focused on
exploring the chondrogenic potential effects of BMP9 on ACPCs. Because other factors, such as
cell environment and scaffold, are also crucial to improve the cell differentiation and integration
in the cartilage native tissue, different three-dimensional (3D) structures were also studied under
BMP9 conditions. Norbornene Acid Hyaluronic modified hydrogels (NorHa) were used to
improve the chondrogenic differentiation of ACPCs, and polycaprolactone (PCL) 3D printed
meshes were assessed as possible articular cartilage implants to guide and reinforce the
chondrogenic differentiation."
The Effect of Sea Level Rise on Estuarine Morphology Of Natural and Dredged Estuaries in Experimental Setup,"['Lingbeek, Josephien']","['Kleinhans, Maarten']",2023-12-01T00:01:14Z,EN,['Estuary; Morphology; Sea Level Rise; Dredging; Scale-Experiments; Tidal Zonation; Bank Stability'],Earth Surface and Water,"Many estuaries are of great economic importance as they are home to large harbours and provide passage to large container ships when extensively dredged. Estuaries are also typically rich in mudflats and marshes that provide flood protection and are home to biodiverse ecosystems. The impact of Sea Level Rise (SLR) on these estuaries and the functions they provide may be large. Therefore, it is important to understand how all the different morphological features of estuaries (e.g., channels, tidal zonation) form and interact in natural and dredged systems and how they will respond to future SLR in order to develop sustainable management strategies. To research the effect of future SLR, two experiments were conducted in the Metronome tidal flume, one with a natural estuary and SLR and one with a dredged estuary and SLR. The results show that the natural system is better able to keep up with SLR than the dredged system. In the upstream regions of the natural system, channel mobility decreased and bank stability increased relative to natural estuaries without SLR, and thus SLR stabilises upstream estuarine morphology. In the upstream regions of the dredged system, the channel mobility significantly increased due to a strongly meandering channel that eroded the banks in the outer bends. As a result, the bank stability decreased in the dredged system with SLR relative to natural and dredged systems without SLR. While dredging on its own stabilises estuarine morphology, it destabilises estuarine morphology in combination with SLR. In the downstream regions of the estuary, bank stability decreases under influence of SLR for both the natural and dredged system. In dredged systems like the Western Scheldt, the results show that current dredging strategy is not sustainable with SLR, because total dredging volumes will increase as SLR and dredging continue and the most heavily dredged areas move upstream due to transgression."
Between Perpetrator and Victim: Apartheid’s Askaris and the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission,"['Savage, Hannah']","['Vukusic, I.']",2023-12-01T00:01:19Z,EN,['South Africa; apartheid; TRC; conflict resolution; restorative justice; victims; perpetrators; human rights violations'],History,"In 1994, South Africa entered a new era of peace and democracy with the election of Nelson Mandela, who became the country’s first democratically elected president. With this, South Africa was closing the chapter on its violent past, which was marked by white supremacy, systematic racism and social engineering. However, Mandela’s election alone was not enough to unite the deeply divided country, whose past was cruel and enormously violent. Some form of transitional justice was needed. Through various negotiations, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was born. Based on the foundations of restorative justice, the TRC sought to investigate the events of the past and establish as accurate a picture as possible regarding the nature of gross human rights violations that took place during apartheid. This thesis examines the case of the askaris; black people, generally former liberation fighters, turned operatives for the apartheid Security Police, working primarily for the death squad known as Vlakplaas, who came forward and applied for amnesty at the TRC. Through questioning how the askaris were configured by the TRC, as figures who committed egregious acts against their fellow black South Africans, while at the same time being victims of apartheid themselves, this thesis demonstrates the complicated position of the askaris and perpetrator-victims in general. This thesis reveals the general lack of nuance afforded to the askaris by the TRC. By utilising Baines’ theory of complex political perpetrators, it makes an argument for a more nuanced approach to perpetrator-victims in future post-conflict settlements like truth commissions."
"A Longitudinal Study on the Effects of Aducanumab on Alzheimer’s Disease-Induced
Brain Regional Atrophy and White Matter Hyperintensities","['Nigi, Alessandro']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2023-12-01T00:01:37Z,EN,[],Medical Imaging,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia among elderly individuals. Despite extensive research, the exact 
underlying causes of the syndrome remain unknown, hindering the development of effective medications to prevent or alleviate 
its progression. In 2021, Biogen introduced aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody that targets and clears neuritic plaques 
(NP) consisting of abnormal protein aggregates formed by amyloid β (Aβ). NP are well-established biomarkers specific to AD 
that consistently correlate with synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss in affected areas. However, clinical 
trials demonstrated that aducanumab does not lead to significant cognitive benefits. Despite the ineffectiveness of aducanumab 
on cognitive performance, no studies have investigated whether the treatment positively affects other frequently studied AD 
biomarkers, such as brain atrophy and the development of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) associated with white matter 
(WM) damage. Examining the impact of the treatment on these structural AD features could provide insight into the role of 
NP and shed light on the extent of the effects resulting from their removal. In this study, we conducted a longitudinal 
investigation to explore the influence of aducanumab on AD-related atrophy in critical brain regions and the development of 
lobar WMHs. We compared the results from a group of aducanumab-treated AD (TAD) patients with those of normal AD 
(NAD) patients and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Overall, our findings indicate that aducanumab does 
not mitigate regional atrophy. However, it effectively slows down the growth and spread of WMH volumes over a two-year 
treatment period. These results suggest that aducanumab may help limit WM damage, thereby mitigating the disrupted 
connectivity commonly observed in AD brains. This effect could potentially prevent the decline of cognitive abilities that 
heavily rely on intact WM, such as working memory. Our study concludes that combination therapy targeting multiple aspects 
of AD may be the most effective treatment."

For more than 10 years, it has been continuously emphasised that the Dutch government sees Israeli settlements as illegal and against international law.  However, the governments didn’t take measures or implement sanctions to force the Israeli government to stop building and expanding settlements. Meanwhile, the Dutch government does keep portraying itself as an important friend of Israel and ally to Palestine. The governments tried to position themselves as neutral partner, to be able to contribute to the peace process. The reality is that Israel keeps expanding its settlements in Palestine and that the Dutch government hasn't been able, or hasn't been trying, to stop this."
"Developing a Conceptual Framework For
The Comprehensiveness of Social Life Cycle Assessment - A Case Study on Oiconomy Pricing","['Liao, Weiying']","['Kalfagianni, Agni']",2023-12-01T00:01:46Z,EN,['Social Life Cycle Assessment; SLCA; S-LCA; Oiconomy'],Sustainable Development,"Achieving sustainability in global value chains is a complex challenge for businesses pursuing the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The intricacies stem from diverse organizations across tiers and regions, resulting in inefficiencies in addressing cross-border environmental and societal impacts, often considered external costs. Lifecycle-based assessment approach helps practitioners identify environmental and societal risks in product life cycles and develop policies for sustainable practices. However, compared to environmental life cycle assessment (E-LCA), social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) is still in early development. The lack of a universal S-LCA methodology has led to discrepancies and difficulties in sharing and comparing assessment findings. To address this, there is an urgent need to develop comprehensive S-LCA impact categories and indicators for improved standardization and practical use. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on internalizing environmental and social externalities for sustainability, with methods such as Oiconomy Pricing, a lifecycle-based methodology designed for monetizing sustainability impacts.

This research seeks to improve our understanding of S-LCA methodology comprehensiveness by creating a framework based on scientific discussions and applying it to a case study on Oiconomy Pricing. The study examines whether Oiconomy Pricing's design and social impact categories can universally evaluate social life cycle impacts. The main research question and two sub-research questions are formulated accordingly.

RQ: How comprehensive is the Oiconomy System as an S-LCA instrument?
Sub-RQ 1) What are the characteristics of a comprehensive S-LCA methodology?
Sub-RQ 2) How well does Oiconomy Pricing align with comprehensive S-LCA criteria?

This research assesses the comprehensiveness of Oiconomy through a multifaceted approach, including literature, international standards, interviews with and materiality analysis on the Oiconomy Pricing pilot company, expert consultations, and the author's experience as the tool user. Furthermore, a conceptual framework for understanding the comprehensiveness of S-LCA was proposed for systematic analysis. The framework consists of five criteria- Lifecycle thinking, Stakeholder inclusiveness, Impact pathway, Context-specific adaptation, and a set of consensus-based social topics. The combined result indicates that Oiconomy Pricing is a comprehensive methodology by design but neglected to include diverse stakeholder interests associated with social capital, especially value chain governance, and engagement. Three recommendations are given for its future development. This thesis contributes to the literature on knowledge building of S-LCA and helps business practitioners integrate S-LCA with a plethora of corporate sustainability management tools. Future studies can look at the integration of social justice, 5Ps, and intertwined sustainability topics in LCSA."
Review of genetic analyses for sex differences in intracranial aneurysms,"['Boonstra, Liese']","['Bakker, Mark']",2023-12-01T01:01:15Z,EN,[],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"An intracranial aneurysm (IA) is a dilation of an artery in the brain that fills with blood. They have a chance to rupture from the pressure and cause blood to spill into the surrounding tissue causing a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). IAs are also relatively common among the general population with an occurrence of 3 to 5%. SAH causes severe health issues in a large portion of patients such as permanent disability and has a high mortality rate. This means that although the amount of IAs that rupture is low, it affects the patient's health severely when it does. However, current treatment still has many limitations and IAs go unnoticed until it ruptures in most cases. That’s why it is important to further improve the assessment and treatment of IA.

To better understand IAs, two topics are especially important: heritable factors (genetic background) and differences between males and females. People with first or second-degree family members who already have suffered from an SAH are more likely to develop IAs and the occurrence of IAs in this subgroup is 7%. Factors of IAs such as risk of development, age at which the IA develops and location in the brain at which the IAs occur, are all found to be influenced by genetics. Some of the genetic factors that cause IAs also influence other health issues which are also influenced by genetics, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Overall, these findings mean that IAs are influenced by genetics. Regarding sex differences, females are more likely to develop an IA or an SAH. Besides that, factors of IAs such
as the location of the IA or the number of IAs that have developed are also found to be different between males and females. Although information is known about the genetic background and sex differences separately, the combination is currently severely understudied. It is as of yet unknown how and to what extent the genetic background influences and causes the sex differences.

However, multiple options to study the genetic background of sex differences are available and since these options could be very useful in better understanding IAs, this review aims to provide an overview of current available methods. Three categories are described in this review. The first category is finding new genetic association studies which look for new genes that cause IAs. The second category is shared biology, meaning to look if there are any similarities in genetic background when comparing two diseases with each other. The third category is risk prediction, meaning looking at a person’s DNA and predicting the risk of developing an IA. By doing these different methods for a male group and female group separately, differences between the two groups might be found.

The methods that are described in the paper and summarized in the paragraph above, have the potential to provide insights that are beneficial to better understanding IAs but could also aid the development of the prevention, assessment and treatment of IAs. Thereby lowering the number of patients and severe health issues that IAs can cause. Despite the methods being promising, it is vital to develop genetic studies carefully and keep in mind limitations. It is important to choose the right method and to understand the results well. Besides that, the methods and tools that can be used for genetic studies are being improved very quickly. This means new methods are being developed constantly and staying on top of those developments should be a priority."
"Barriers and enablers for the implementation of large-scale Nature-based Solutions for flood mitigation in the Po Valley, Italy","['Zenaro, Chiara']","['Duden, Anna']",2023-12-01T00:01:49Z,EN,[],Sustainable Development,"Nature-based Solutions (NBS) represent holistic, cost-effective approaches that address complex challenges while yielding multiple co-benefits, thereby being an alternative to or complementing traditional ""grey"" solutions. Large-scale NBS have proven effective in mitigating floods, particularly in flood-prone countries like the Netherlands (NL). Moreover, these measures not only provide long-term flood mitigation but also enhance habitat, ecosystems, and human well-being. However, in the Po Valley (PV), a crucial socio-economic area in Northern Italy susceptible to catastrophic floods, large-scale implementation and research on NBS for flood mitigation are still lacking. The PV relies on an extensive embankment system to manage floods, but this method is considered insufficient to meet the future challenges posed by climate change, land use, and urbanization, which are projected to increase the frequency of catastrophic floods. Given the similarities between the NL and the PV in terms of landscape, socio-economic development, and flood-related challenges, a comparative analysis of the ex-ante and ex-post barriers and enablers to large-scale NBS uptake between these regions could provide lessons for the PV to promote NBS implementation to enhance flood protection. A mixed-method approach based on both qualitative and quantitative research was adopted, including literature reviews, spatial modelling, and interviews with experts. First, the impacts and causes of floods in the PV were examined to provide background information on the magnitude of the issue. Second, ex-ante and ex-post barriers and enablers to NBS adoption in the PV and the NL respectively were investigated. Then, the comparison between barriers and enablers allowed for the identification of lessons for the PV to take up from the NL experience. Lastly, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis was conducted to highlight potential opportunities and threats associated with NBS implementation or non-implementation in the PV. In general, findings reveal that the PV faces more and greater barriers than the NL, while enablers are often hindered by short-term and small-scale actions. Lessons from the NL thus highlight the importance of long-term, integrated, and participative strategies for policymakers and stakeholders to foster large-scale NBS implementation for flood mitigation in the PV. By doing so, the PV can address future flood-related challenges by providing large-scale and long-term flood protection and achieving co-benefits deriving from NBS implementation."
Repoliticizing Women and their Pasts: A Reconsideration of the Position of Women in the History of the Netherlands (1795 – 1950),"['Smit, Noor de']","['Dijn, Annelien de']",2023-12-01T01:01:01Z,EN,['Feminism; the Netherlands; Political History'],History,"In this thesis I reconstruct a section of the history of women’s emancipatory activities in the Netherlands from 1795 until the 1930s. This reconstruction serves a dual purpose: firstly, to affirm that the current ‘wave-analogy,’ which has been widely used and criticized in feminist history, is indeed inadequate. This is the case because, as my thesis shows, a tide-like increase and decrease of emancipatory activity by women is demonstrably false — rather the socio-political climate largely determines whether this activity becomes situated at the forefront of the public sphere/stage. On top of that, the identification of any sort of starting point in history for feminism —or ‘First Wave’— is a teleological fallacy. I demonstrate this through a content analysis and socio-political contextualization of a wide variety of primary sources which range from anywhere between public speeches, anonymous pamphlets and novels. I find that women have been structurally excluded from political history both as subjects and authors and have been forced into an isolationist position in the historical discipline. This connects to the second goal of this thesis, which is to propose a revaluation of the current narrative of feminist history and the wealth of existing historical material surrounding it to integrate it into a general narrative of Dutch political history. As opposed to the isolationist and discredited position wherein political activity by women has been pushed solely based on gender instead of an individual’s political actions."
Analysis of Childhood Trauma and Epigenetic Age Acceleration Showed No Apparent Link or Sex Specific Effects in Adolescents,"['Groot, Michelle de']","['Boks, Marco']",2023-12-01T01:01:12Z,EN,['Childhood trauma; Epigenetic age; DNA methylation; Sex differences'],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"Research indicates that adverse childhood events are associated with accelerated biological aging, which is linked to negative effects on mortality and an increased susceptibility to psychiatric diseases. Additionally, differences in pace of biological aging between men and women have been reported.  A widely used measure for biological age is epigenetic age, for which so-called epigenetic clocks are developed.  We analyzed a dataset of 500 young participants and assessed childhood trauma using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Epigenetic age acceleration was calculated using five different commonly used epigenetic clocks. Our results revealed no significant associations between childhood trauma and epigenetic age acceleration, and no sex specific effect. Moreover, we examined the role of genetic risk for childhood trauma on epigenetic age acceleration. Similarly, this analysis yielded no significant results or detect any notable sex specific effects. These findings suggest that there may not be a significant correlation between childhood trauma and epigenetic age acceleration in adolescents that experienced moderate childhood trauma exposure. This paper also highlights the need to incorporate larger sample sizes and consider potential sex-specific effects to comprehend these interactions and their implications for overall health and mortality."

Perceived friends’ support has a positive effect on the relation between mental health and well-being in adolescence. Additionally, family’s socioeconomic status (SES) plays a role in shaping adolescent experiences that profoundly impact the relation between mental health and well-being. Therefore, including friends’ support and SES offers an opportunity to test whether familial factor and/or social factor can influence the relation between loneliness and life satisfaction. Participants of the present study were 409 Dutch adolescents, 16-25 years of age (Mage = 17.76, SD = 1.67). They filled in questionnaires in two waves (May/June 2020 and October 2020/January 2021) as a part of the longitudinal data set collection Youth Got Talent.  Results revealed that adolescents who felt lonely were significantly less satisfied with their lives 7 months later and this negative relation was stronger for adolescents from higher SES background. The effect of friends’ support was not significant. Future studies should consider the limitations of this study and use its findings for future interventions to decrease loneliness and improve life satisfaction among adolescents."
Toward A Normative Account of Machine Learning Explanation Via Levels of Abstraction,"['Schoneveld, Kuil']","['De, Michael']",2023-12-01T01:01:05Z,EN,"[""Levels of Abstraction; Machine Learning; Understanding; Explanation; Epistemology; Normativity; Marr's Levels""]",Artificial Intelligence,"The aim of this thesis will be to bridge between the domains of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and the normative criteria required for the responsible deployment of such models. The innate difficulty in understanding complex information processing systems such as those constituting the field of artificial intelligence motivates the need for methods to untangle their inner workings. Toward this end, I argue for the use of a fundamental epistemological method - that of Levels of Abstraction (LoAs) - for clarifying the workings of such systems.
I begin by articulating a predominant account of scientific understanding from Kareem Khalifa to argue that opacity, as the main obstacle to understanding, is a phenomenon relative to those seeking an explanation (Section 2). After describing the Method of LoAs, I motivate a transition from using Marr’s levels of analysis to LoAs in the domain of AI to ground normative criteria for comparing explanations (Section 3). I then provide further examples of the usefulness of LoAs in the domain of AI for the sake of conceptualizing the responsibility gap and understanding advanced properties in AI models (Section 4)."

Stakeholder Frames of Carbon Farming in the German Agricultural Sector: Analysing Cooperative and Conflictual Dynamics,"['Dirks, Nora']","['Runhaar, Hens']",2023-12-02T00:00:46Z,EN,['carbon farming; frame analysis; stakeholder dynamics; Germany'],Sustainable Development,"Soil carbon sequestration is claimed to offer a potential solution to climate change and unsustainable agricultural practices by transferring CO2 from the atmosphere into the soil. This process, in recent years referred to as “carbon farming”, has the capacity to enhance resilience, improve soil health, increase productivity, and reduce the need for fertilisers and pesticides. Yet, its effectiveness in mitigating climate change remains a subject of debate.
This study delves into the complex world of carbon farming and its adoption in the German agricultural sector, using frame theory to explore the diverse perspectives of stakeholders. While previous research has focused on barriers and business models, the role of shared stakeholder understanding in shaping the development and adoption of carbon farming practices has received limited attention.
This research identifies three main frames that influence stakeholder positions. The technoeconomic frame centres on economic, innovative, and technical aspects, sparking a longstanding scientific debate and emphasising outcome-based financing schemes. The social and political acceptability frame gains prominence with the introduction of the European Commission’s proposal for a harmonised certification framework, highlighting social and governance considerations. It also addresses the widely debated concern of potential mitigation deterrence. The responsible development frame underscores environmental, equity, and justice aspects while steering private sector business models towards promoting ecosystem services over sequestered carbon.
Implications are drawn from the prevalence of conflicting frames and unresolved issues in stakeholder dynamics. The ongoing yet nascent nature of the debate, coupled with the perception of carbon farming as a niche topic, results in limited stakeholder contention. However, this research emphasises the importance of shared understanding and collaboration between stakeholders in addressing the challenges and opportunities of carbon farming.
This mixed methods study integrates stakeholder analysis, content analysis, and semi-structured interviews, offering valuable insights into the multifaceted landscape of carbon farming in the German agricultural sector. The findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand and pave the way for more informed and effective decision-making."

The Relationship between Autistic Traits and Social Attention in Typically Developing Individuals,"['Huang, Yeling']","['Brink, Teuni ten']",2023-12-01T01:01:41Z,EN,['autism spectrum disorder; autistic traits; attention orienting; social attention'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a neuro-developmental disorder characterized by deficits in reciprocal social behavior and communication, as well as by repetitive behaviors and restrictive interests. One of the most salient and specific features of ASD is the deficit in social attention, including deficiency in gaze orienting and atypical social attention allocation. In the past decades, researchers have argued that ASD represents the upper extreme of a continuum of autistic traits which are distributed in the general population. According to this view, the present study aimed to further investigate the relationship between autistic traits and social attention in the typically developing population. Participants (N = 39) were categorized as having lower or higher autistic traits based upon the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire. We first assessed social attention using a gaze-cueing task, for which no group differences were found. Next, participants viewed a video clip with high social content twice, after which their fixations were classified as being on the face, the body or the background region. Participants with higher autistic traits exhibited atypical social attention allocation compared to individuals with lower autistic traits, with less time viewing the face region, specifically the happy face. Altogether, the current results did not support the relationship between autistic traits and the gaze-cueing effect, which could be due to the overall low level of autistic traits in the sample. Nevertheless, the present study provided insight into how the level of autistic traits in the typical developing population could be associated with the allocation of social attention and provided further evidence for the relationship between autistic traits and social attention."
Shortness of breath as diagnostic factor for acute coronary syndrome in callers to out-of-hours primary care,"['Spek, Michelle']","['Venekamp, Roderick']",2023-12-01T01:01:45Z,EN,['Primary care; Triage; Chest discomfort; Acute coronary syndrome; Shortness of breath'],Epidemiology Postgraduate,"Inleiding: 
Pijn op de borst en kortademigheid zijn belangrijke symptomen bij patiënten met acuut coronair syndroom (ACS). Het is echter onbekend of kortademigheid gebruikt kan worden als diagnostische factor voor het herkennen van ACS tijdens telefonische triage bij bellers met pijn op de borst op de huisartsenpost (HAP). 
Methode: 
Een cross-sectionele studie uitgevoerd met data van vijf huisartsenposten in de regio Utrecht 2014 en 2017. Deze data werden gekoppeld aan follow-up gegevens van de eigen huisarts van de patiënt, inclusief specialistenbrieven. Telefonische triagegesprekken werden geanalyseerd van bellers met klachten verdacht voor een ACS, waarbij patiënten met kortademigheid werden vergeleken met degenen die geen kortademigheid rapporteerden. We bepalen de relatie tussen kortademigheid en (i) toewijzing met hoge urgentie, (ii) ACS en (iii) ACS of andere levensbedreigende aandoeningen. 
Resultaten:
Van de 2.195 bellers verdacht voor een ACS meldden 1.096 (49,9%) kortademigheid (43,7% van de mannen, 56,3% van de vrouwen). In totaal bleek 15,3% van de mannen (13,2% van de mannen met SOB) en 8,4% van de vrouwen (9,2% van de vrouwen met SOB) ACS te hebben. Kortademigheid was geassocieerd met hoge urgentie toewijzing (75,9% vs. 60,8%, OR: 2,03; 95% CI 1,69-2,44, mOR: 2,03; 95% CI 1,69-2,44), maar niet met ACS (10,9% vs. 12. 0%; OR: 0,90; 95% CI 0,69-1,17, mOR: 0,91; 95% CI 0,70-1,19) of ACS of andere levensbedreigende ziekten (15,0% vs. 14,1%; OR: 1,07; 95% CI 0,85-1,36, mOR: 1,09; 95% CI 0,86-1,38). Voor vrouwen was de relatie met ACS 9,2% vs. 7,5%, OR: 1,25; 95% CI 0,83-1,88, en voor mannen 13,2% vs. 17,4%, OR: 0,72; 95% CI 0,51-1,02. Voor ACS of andere levensbedreigende aandoeningen was dit voor vrouwen 13,0% vs. 8,5%, OR: 1,60; 95% CI 1,10-2,32, en voor mannen 17,5% vs. 20,8%, OR: 0,81; 95% CI 0,59-1,12.
Conclusie:
Mannen en vrouwen verdacht voor een ACS en klachten van kortademigheid die contact opnemen met de HAP krijgen vaker een hoge urgentie dan degenen zonder kortademigheid. Dit lijkt adequaat te zijn bij vrouwen maar niet bij mannen wanneer het risico op ACS of andere levensbedreigende aandoeningen in overweging wordt genomen."
Paradoxes of the sharing economy - the case of peer-to-peer clothes sharing,"['Dorstewitz, Melina']","['Tunn, Vivian']",2023-12-02T00:00:50Z,EN,['sharing economy; peer-to-peer asset sharing; clothes sharing; consumer behavior; behavioral paradoxes'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Introduction – Peer-to-peer asset sharing platforms are a sharing economy business model emphasizing access rather than ownership. Research on consumer motivations, barriers, and dilemmas is growing, revealing various influential intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Moreover, research on SE paradoxes is increasing. However, there is a lack of research on the impact on consumer behavior and niche platforms such as peer-to-peer clothes sharing platforms. It is uncertain whether this model promotes social and environmental goals or leads to ambiguous behavior. This study, therefore, examines What behavioral paradoxes occur in peer-to-peer clothes sharing? Theory – As there are many definitions of SE and business models, the definitional basis is established with the main characteristics, such as peer-to-peer, online asset sharing, temporary access, or monetary exchange, thus providing the framework for this study. In addition, the paradoxical perspective of this study is presented, which is important for further data analysis. Methods – This study uses a qualitative, exploratory method with a grounded theory orientation and inductive, iterative data analysis. The literature review (LR) explored motivations, barriers, implicit and explicit paradoxes, and participant perspectives, while the purposive sampling of interviewees for the semi-structured interviews enabled deeper insights into consumer behavior in clothes sharing. Thus, new insights were embedded into existing knowledge, and behavioral paradoxes were uncovered. Results – The results show that motivations on the user side are influenced by personal motivations, feelings, sustainability, social, economic, and trust. While the peer provider has economic, social, and trust as motivations. It is also evident that the platform provider plays a greater role with additional offers (events, responsibility) and influences peer behavior. Overall, the existence of behavioral paradoxes on these platforms could be confirmed. A total of 11 behavioral paradoxes were identified, divided into interpersonal (between peers) and intrapersonal (within a person) paradoxes, which influence the effectiveness of these platforms. Discussion/Conclusion – This study fills the gap with motivations, barriers, and behavioral paradoxes among peers on peer-to-peer clothes sharing platforms, providing insights into the complex interplay between surrounding factors, individual preferences, and platform conditions. The new findings on the different levels of behavioral paradoxes reveal the deep-rooted complexity between peers and within an individual. Therefore, it is not only about sustainable or economic factors but also about psychological and social dynamics influencing peers. This leads to a better understanding to develop strategies that account for these paradoxes and better predict, influence, accept, or adopt peer behavior."
The ZEro Trust DECision Making (ZEDEC) Method: Selecting Relevant Zero Trust Concepts to Mitigate High-Priority Risks,"['Dijen, Bjorn van']","['Labunets, Kate']",2023-12-01T01:01:17Z,EN,['Zero trust architecture; risk management; decision making; zero trust migration; ZEDEC method; MITRE ATT&CK framework'],Business Informatics,"Zero trust is a security principle that allows organisations to be more resilient to cyber threats than the traditional perimeter-based security solutions, by ensuring that users and devices are not trusted by default. In order to minimize security risks, 72 \% of the companies were planning to implement zero trust capabilities into their security solutions in 2020. However, zero trust architectures have not yet succeeded in replacing traditional security solutions, because organisations have trouble overseeing how they should handle the migration process --- the design of a zero trust architecture differs per organisation, depending on their needs. Therefore, this research proposes a ZEro trust DECision making (ZEDEC) method that helps these organisations decide which zero trust concepts they should integrate into their zero trust architecture. We follow the design science method to construct ZEDEC. In the first part of the research, we conduct a structured literature review and expert interviews to identify relevant method fragments. We identify multiple zero trust concepts that organisations should consider to integrate into their zero trust architecture and discover how organisations are currently migrating towards a zero trust architecture. We also discover that in the migration process towards a zero trust architecture, organisations mainly consider zero trust mitigations that address cyber security risks as factors to decide which zero trust concepts they want to include in their zero trust architecture. Therefore, we introduce a decision matrix that includes a mapping between the zero trust mitigations and their related zero trust concepts. Ultimately, we propose the ZEDEC method with the main activities: (1) create a vision on needed changes, (2) identify context, (3) perform risk assessment and (4) identify zero trust concepts. Through an evaluation with a security expert of a theoretical scenario, we confirm that the method is correct and useful."
CREATING CRISPR-CAS9 KO OF ADAM10 AND TSPAN14 TO ENABLE THEIR STUDY IN EV UPTAKE AND CARGO TRANSFER MECHANISMS,"['Guerreiro Cabana, Mafalda']","['Vader, Pieter']",2023-12-01T01:01:43Z,EN,['CRISPR; ADAM10; TSPAN14; Extracellular Vesicles; EV cargo transfer'],Biology of Disease,"Extracellular Vesicles (EVs ) are lipidic membrane particles with the ability of carrying nucleic acids and proteins between two cells with great specificity. Because they happen in physiological conditions to enable intracellular communication, EVs are not immunogenic, making them attractive RNA therapeutic carriers. However, little is known about the steps of EV uptake/cargo release in target cells. Preliminary data suggested a role for ADAM10 and TSPAN14, two EV surface proteins, in mediating EV cargo transfer to recipient cells. Therefore here we aim to establish a research tool to help us understand the exact role of these proteins in the processes of EV uptake and intracellular cargo release . To do so, we have designed sgRNAs to integrate into a preexisting Cas9 plasmid (#199), which was expanded in TOP10 competent bacteria and isolated. We thoroughly tested the efficiency of the KO at the DNA (Alt-R), mRNA (RT-qPCR) and protein (western blotting) levels in cells transfected with the designed sgRNAs. We also identified  western blotting as an inefficient technique to assess ADAM10 expression in cell lysates. In addition, we have identified two sgRNA candidates per protein to create the KO cell line: A1 and A2 for ADAM10 and T1 and T2 for TSPAN14 , which can be used to establish two stable KO cell lines for both proteins to proceed with EV uptake/cargo release studies. Lastly, our data also suggests TSPAN14 to have a low turn-over as the protein expression upon KO does not decrease 3 weeks post-transfection."
Towards a Universal Recommender System: a Linked Open Data Approach,"['Hubert, Gustav']","['Chekol, Mel']",2023-12-01T01:01:34Z,EN,"['Recommender systems;Linked Open Data, general-purpose;domain-independent;inductive learning']",Computing Science,"Recommender systems (RSs) play a crucial role in helping users make informed decisions in the face of an ever-increasing array of choices. Most RSs are domain-specific, but domain-independent (or general purpose) RSs can be applied to a wide range of application areas, leveraging data and insights from different domains and handling large user populations. Current RS research is dominated by ""improve the state-of-the-art"", in terms of accuracy, speed and scale. Truly domain-independent recommender systems currently represent a gap in research, as is shown in this work. 

This thesis explores the development of a general-purpose RS and the use of LOD to integrate data from different domains in an unsupervised way. Building a system that can effectively generate recommendations for any domain without prior knowledge of the data is challenging. Linked Open Data (LOD) offers a solution to this problem by enabling the integration of data from multiple domains. We explore and evaluate various unsupervised methods for acquiring and sorting through data, and using it to generate accurate recommendations. The resulting product is a truly domain-independent recommendation framework that can, in theory, be applied to a large variety of use-cases without requiring modification. Finally, this thesis suggests future research directions for building more effective general-purpose RSs."
Exploring the Neural Network-Quantum Field Theory Correspondence,"['Markus, Julian']","['Jefferson, R.']",2023-12-01T01:01:29Z,EN,['Neural Networks'],Computing Science,"Signal propagation is an important factor impacting the trainability of neural networks where better signal propagation leads to better training performance. 
Signal propagation can be ordered, where signals decay, chaotic, where signals decorrelate or critical, where a signal neither decays nor decorrelates.
Mean Field Theory (MFT) based formulations exist to predict signal propagation in neural networks, which have shown empirical success in achieving better training performance.
MFT formulations, however, operate under the assumption of infinitely wide network layers, which do not exist in practice.
Quantum field theory-based formulations aim to correct this assumption by formulating a new signal propagation prediction called the NN-QFT correspondence. 
In this thesis, the accuracy of predictions from the NN-QFT correspondence have been empirically explored.
The NN-QFT correspondence appears to be data-invariant for feedforward neural networks and accurate in predictions for networks sufficiently distanced from the critical point.
For linear networks, the theory appears to predict the critical point correctly. 
The theoretical critical point for nonlinear networks does not match the empirically found critical point.
Critical behaviour observed for these networks appears to agree with theory.
Additionally, observations appear to correlate the periodic behaviour of individual neurons and the critical to chaotic transition."
Trehalase as novel antifungal target in Aspergillus fumigatus,"['Dieleman, Chendo']","['Cock, Hans de']",2023-12-05T00:00:48Z,EN,['CRISPR/Cas9; Fungal Infections; Aspergillus; Aspergillus fumigatus; trehalase; ku80; PCR; Protein purification; His-tag; EUCAST'],Environmental Biology,"Aspergillus fumigatus is a filamentous ascomycetous fungus that leads a saprotrophic lifestyle. Due to its airborne spores, this fungus can spread easily and colonize different environments such as plants, soil, and animals. In humans, these spores can end up in the respiratory track, where it is usually cleared by the host’s immune system. However, this is not always the case for patients suffering from either immunological problems, for example due to chemotherapy, or genetic make up and/or pulmonary diseases like  cystic fibrosis. In these patients, Aspergillus fumigatus thrives and causes health complications in the lungs, such as the deadly manifestation of aspergillosis: invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. As the available antifungals for aspergillosis treatment and management are limited, and antifungal resistant Aspergilli are emerging, there is an urgent need for novel antifungals. Previously, trehalase has been coined as a novel antifungal target due to its role in germination of conidiospores. Hence, this study focusses on multiple aspects related to trehalase inhibition to advance potential drug development. One of the goals was to express TreB in E. coli BL21 and purify it for selection of a novel peptide inhibitor via the  RaPID Bioaffinity assay. In addition, chemical inhibition of TreB was performed using validamycin A in a EUCAST-like protocol, and the germination kinetics were followed and compared to other (clinically relevant) Aspergilli. The last goal of this research was to create a ΔtreB mutant through a protoplast mediated CRISPR/Cas9 protocol to simulate complete inhibition of the enzyme. Using the E. coli BL21 system, trehalase initially seemed to be produced sufficiently. Unfortunately, protein extraction and purification remained unfruitful. This could be due to the low expression or stability of the TreB protein since it lacked 4 amino acids, as was revealed after DNA sequencing. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of conidiospores illustrate the versatility of the spores, as the lack of intracellular trehalose digestion does not seem to limit the germination process when other carbon sources than trehalose are available. Interestingly, Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus niger were affected by validamycin when grown in AMM containing trehalose, but Aspergillus fumigatus was not. Although not proven in this study, this might be due to either a different three-dimensional configuration of the trehalose-specific binding site in A. fumigatus trehalase, or an alternative system that does rescue the germination of A. fumigatus, regardless of validamycin A induced TreB inhibition. This does highlight the importance of creating a ΔtreB mutant strain, as these hypothesises could then be tested. Finally, a knock-out strain of the treB gene has not been created successfully. However, it was demonstrated that the spores exposed to the CRISPR/Cas9 procedure did inherit change in micromorphology, as hyphae were found to be thinner in AMM containing trehalose and germlings were less developed in AMM containing proline. These results highlight the necessary caution upon these kind of experiments as the used CEA10Δku80 strain has an overall higher mutation rate, thus increasing the odds of observing finding unexpected changes in phenotype."

Er is weinig kwalitatief onderzoek gedaan naar deze etnische discriminatiegronden. Ook is er geringe maatschappelijke belangstelling voor deze gemeenschappen wanneer het aankomt op etnische discriminatie.
In de beleidsdocumentanalyse zijn negen documenten aangaande het huidige antidiscriminatiebeleid geanalyseerd. Hierbij is gelet op de kwalitatieve en kwantitatieve inhoud van de documenten. Uit de empirische resultaten van deze documentanalyse is gebleken dat er geringe beleidsaandacht is voor Indische en Molukse Nederlanders in het huidige antidiscriminatiebeleid. Indische Nederlanders worden niet benoemd en Molukse Nederlanders eenmalig maar niet in direct verband met discriminatie. Vervolgens is deze beperkte beleidsaandacht verklaard aan de hand van het stromenmodel van Kingdon.
Vervolgens zijn er zeventien semigestructureerde interviews gehouden met respondenten van Indisch-Nederlandse en Moluks-Nederlandse families en bestuursleden van Indische en Molukse organisaties. Uit de bevindingen is gebleken dat de eerste, tweede en derde generatie van beide gemeenschappen op basis van fenotype of naam te maken hebben met negatieve bejegening of ongelijke behandeling, ondanks dat dit niet in alle gevallen als discriminatie werd geïnterpreteerd. Het overgrote merendeel van de Molukse respondenten gaf aan discriminatie te ervaren, terwijl een minderheid van de Indische respondenten rapporteerde discriminatie te ervaren. Ten aanzien van beleidsopvattingen is gebleken dat er vanuit de Molukse respondenten behoefte is aan meer beleidsaandacht voor anti-Molukse discriminatie. Daarentegen betwijfelden de meeste Indische respondenten of er meer beleidsaandacht nodig is voor anti-Indische discriminatie, mede vanwege het gebrek aan eigen discriminatie- ervaringen. Tenslotte gaven alle Indische bestuurders en nagenoeg alle Molukse bestuurders aan dat er sprake is van koloniale doorwerking in hedendaagse ervaren discriminatie onder de gemeenschappen.
Met inachtneming van de bevindingen uit de documentanalyse en de interviews kan worden afgeleid dat het huidige antidiscriminatiebeleid in zekere mate ontoereikend is voor de bestrijding van ervaren discriminatie onder Indische en Molukse Nederlanders. Voordat beleid wordt aangepast dient echter wel met beleidsbehoeften van beide gemeenschappen rekening te worden gehouden."

Het doel van deze voorlichting is het opwekken van empathie voor en het bevorderen van acceptatie van lhbti+’ers. Alleen bestaan er veel verschillende termen om het over seksuele en genderdiversiteit te hebben en sommige termen hebben mogelijk een negatieve invloed op de bevordering van de acceptatie omdat ze negatieve associaties oproepen. Hierbij is het belangrijk om te beseffen dat de termen die gebruikt worden door verschillende groepen anders kunnen worden ervaren. Als een term bij cisgender en heteroseksuele jongeren negatieve associaties oproept, hoeft dit niet te betekenen dat dit ook geldt voor lhbti+-jongeren, en andersom. Het doel van dit onderzoek is daarom om te achterhalen welke termen aansluiten op cisgender en heteroseksuele jongeren enerzijds en lhbti+-jongeren anderzijds. Om deze reden is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: Welke termen sluiten in voorlichting over seksuele en genderdiversiteit aan bij heteroseksuele en cisgender jongeren enerzijds en lhbti+-jongeren anderzijds?
Om antwoord te geven op de onderzoeksvraag is er een enquête verspreid onder cisgender en heteroseksuele jongeren enerzijds, en lhbti+-jongeren anderzijds. In de enquête zijn 12 lhbti+-gerelateerde termen bevraagd, waarvan elke respondent er steeds twee voorgelegd heeft gekregen. Er is gevraagd naar kennis over, gebruik van en meningen en gevoelens bij die termen. Daarnaast zijn vier lhbti+-jongeren in een focusgroep ondervraagd. Er is gevraagd naar welke termen zij gebruiken (binnen en buiten de lhbti+-gemeenschap) en wat hun meningen en gevoelens bij die termen zijn.
Uit de antwoorden van de enquête en de focusgroep blijkt dat de bevraagde termen over het algemeen goed aansluiten op zowel cisgender en heteroseksuele jongeren als lhbti+-jongeren. Wel moet er in het bijzonder zorgvuldig om worden gegaan met de termen ‘homo’, ‘gay’, ‘homoseksueel’, ‘lesbie’, ‘lesbisch’, ‘panseksueel’ en ‘transgender’ omdat deze termen negatieve associaties op kunnen roepen bij cisgender en heteroseksuele jongeren, wat de bevordering van empathie en acceptatie bemoeilijkt. Bovendien blijkt dat op lhbti+-jongeren Engelse termen (zoals ‘androgynous’) en afkortingen van termen (zoals ‘bi’ in plaats van ‘biseksueel’) het beste aansluiten in de voorlichting.
Eventueel vervolgonderzoek kan dieper ingaan op de redenen achter het wel of niet gebruiken van bepaalde termen en waarom er bepaalde meningen en gevoelens bij de termen bestaan."

equestrian sports. Dutch equine entrepreneurs do not seem very open to making their businesses more sustainable. The current study researched if the behavioural intention of
Dutch equine entrepreneurs in the decision-making to become more sustainable in terms of
animal welfare can be explained through an extended Theory of planned behaviour, focussing
on attitudes, self-efficacy, social norms, and traditional values. In total, 50 participants were
included. The participants in the sample showed great interest in becoming more sustainable
in the next 5 years. In contrast to my expectations, the scores of the participants in the sample were all moderately average on the questionnaires of attitudes, self-efficacy, social norms, and traditional values. According to the results of this study, there was a direct effect of social norms, but not for attitude and self-efficacy. Traditional values did not have a moderating effect on social norms. In conclusion, the results suggest that the behavioural intentions of the equine entrepreneurs could be more centred around values and norms than previously thought. There are several limitations of the current study that have to be taken into consideration, such as self-selection bias and a small sample size. Further research is necessary because the results of further research could add in the knowledge needed to prevent the Dutch horse industry and equestrian sport from disappearing in the future."
Linking action and imagination: How climate court cases open up the public imagination and fuel inspiration.,"['Breedveld, Nina']","['Vervoort, Joost']",2023-12-02T00:00:54Z,EN,"['Imagination, imaginaries, emotional energy, climate action, strategic climate court cases.']",Sustainable Development,"The 2015 Paris Agreement has given rise to a new trend of climate litigation: strategic climate court cases. Distinct from traditional environmental litigation, these cases – often started by activists – aim to bring about broader societal shifts, such as advancing effective climate policies, raising public awareness, and changing the behaviour of governments and industry actors. While the legal and economic impacts have been widely studied, the more symbolic and societal impact of these cases received limited to no attention. This research studies climate court cases as a source of inspiration. A media analysis and 25 in-depth interviews with Dutch and Swiss climate activists revealed that strategic climate court cases expand the horizons of what people can imagine, thereby opening up the possibility space for new ways of thinking, believing and doing. Building on the theory of imagination and imaginaries, this study underscores the central role of imagination in transformations. Imagination of how things may become motivates action towards change, and in turn, societal change further expands the imagination. Imagination can be studied at individual and collective levels; this multi-level research explores both. At the individual level, it introduces a novel operationalisation of inspiration, considering the role of emotions in bridging imagination and action. Here, inspiration is understood as a combination of (1) expanded imagination, and (2) increased emotional energy, which resonates to feelings of enthusiasm, empowerment, a sense of social connectedness, hope, and motivation. Interviews with Dutch and Swiss climate activists reveal that climate court cases instil new realisations and beliefs about citizens’ political agency, climate accountability, and potential (future) systemic changes, while also increasing individuals’ emotional energy. The latter is found to serve as the emotional engine that propels imagination and motivation for action. At the collective level, conducting a media analysis, this research explores whether climate court cases can be considered an imaginary: an idea or vision that has garnered widespread recognition and is institutionally stabilised, publicly performed and collectively held. Lastly, confirming this premise, this research studies the dynamics between a shared imaginary and individual imagination and inspiration, underscoring the relevance of imaginaries as they provide individuals with validation and a sense of support for their ideas, values, desires, and emotions."

There has however not been much research on causality in (multi-)agent systems. In this work I introduce a way to integrate a structural causal model in multi-agent system models, specifically in a concurrent game structure (CGS). In such a causal CGS, every transition corresponds to an intervention on agent variables of the causal model. The Halpern and Pearl framework of causality is used to determine the effects of a certain value for an agent variable on other variables. This causal CGS allows us to analyse and reason about causal effects of agents’ actions on each other and their shared environment in multi-agent settings. In this work I study and analyse the relation between the derived-multi-agent system model, this causal CGS, and the original structural causal model and I analyse the causal CGS to show a relation between strategic responsibility and causality. This work first gives an overview of the literature on causality, labelled transition systems and concurrent game structures, several temporal logics and several notions of responsibility. After that it defines the notion of a causal CGS, and I show how agent strategies in this CGS relate to causality in the original causal model and show a relation between strategic responsibility and causality in the HP framework. This work can in the future be used for (multi-)agent systems where causal relations play an important role. It can be used to plan strategies or to determine causation and responsibility when things go wrong."

This method is more effective if the latent representation is randomly permuted. This permutation is not easily reversed by a clustering algorithm. A latent representation preserves its data utility well for classification algorithms, even when permuted. Our experiments indicate that a dataset can be represented by multiple, well-performing latent representations, making it difficult for an adversary to discern which dataset was originally encoded. Autoencoders are quick to train, making it a quick method to pseudonymise data whilst retaining data utility for classification algorithms. As a pseudonymisation method, it is possible for the data holder to obtain a reconstruction of the data. However, latent representations would likely not be considered anonymised data by GDPR. Furthermore, regression algorithms perform worse than classification algorithms on latent representations. Finally, despite the popularity of mean squared error, we find that this loss function does not maximise data utility in latent representations."

Peter Pan en 'interactive fandom'. Een onderzoek naar Orgerons concept van 'interactive fandom' met betrekking tot het personage Peter Pan in Photoplay tussen 1924 en 1926.,"['Mans, L.H.']","['Lotze, K.']",2018-03-05T18:01:00Z,nl,"['Peter Pan, interactive fandom, Orgeron, Photoplay']",Film- en Televisiewetenschap,"Dit is een onderzoek naar de vraag in hoeverre Orgerons concept van 'interactive fandom' kan worden toegepast op het personage Peter Pan in Photoplay tussen 1924 en 1926. Oregron omschrijft dit concept met betrekking tot filmsterren. Dit onderzoek zet het concept op een innovatieve wijze in door het te koppelen aan een personage. Er is gebruikt gemaakt van wetenschappelijke literatuur en er is een historische bronnenanalyse uitgevoerd om de onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden. Filmsterren worden volgens Orgeron ingezet wegens hun aantrekkingskracht. Om deze reden is onderzocht wat de aantrekkingskracht van Peter Pan is waardoor filmtijdschriften het personage inzetten om 'interacitve fandom' te bereiken. Er spelen twee factoren een rol: eeuwige jeugd en het feit dat Peter Pan onderdeel is van het collectief geheugen. De eerste factor zien we terug in de geanalyseerde historische bronnen. Er blijkt een spanning te bestaan tussen jeugd en volwassen zijn. De factor betreffende het collectief geheugen is mogelijk slechts impliciet aanwezig in deze bronnen. 
Met betrekking tot de hoofdvraag wordt er tot de conclusie gekomen dat het concept van 'interactive fandom' toepasbaar is op Peter Pan omdat twee van de drie vormen  die Orgeron formuleert, betreffende critici en zelfverbetering, bruikbaar zijn voor de analyse in dit onderzoek. De derde vorm betreffende wedstrijden kan daarentegen niet gekoppeld worden aan het personage Peter Pan. Deze vorm komt om deze reden te vervallen in dit onderzoek. Daarnaast kan het concept van Orgeron worden aangevuld omdat is gebleken dat het niet alleen toepasbaar is op filmsterren maar op het personage Peter Pan. Tevens schrijft Oregron slechts over interactiviteit tussen lezers en filmtijdschriften naar aanleiding van 'interactive fandom'. In dit onderzoek is gebleken dat er ook interactiviteit bestaat tussen lezers onderling. Daarnaast wordt Peter Pan niet alleen ingezet in artikelen en advertenties voor uiterlijke zelfverbetering, waarover Oregron schrijft, maar in artikelen en advertenties verbetering van de leefomgeving. Ten slotte kan er een nieuwe vorm van 'interactive fandom' worden toegevoegd als het gaat om het personage Peter Pan. Bij deze vorm gaat het erom dat artikelen en advertenties uit Photoplay de lezer het gevoel geeft dat deze zelf ook beroemd kan worden door naar de filmstudio's te gaan en auditie te doen."
The Lateralization of Spatial and Temporal Components of Navigation in Humans,"['Hoven, J. van den']","['Ham, Ineke van der', 'Postma, Albert']",2018-07-04T17:01:11Z,en,[],Neuropsychologie,"Episodic memory plays a major role in the navigational abilities of humans. The key concepts of episodic memory are spatial- and temporal memory. These cognitive functions allow people use spatial and temporal cues to explore new places and find their way without the use of navigational aids. Previous research focused mainly on finding the neural correlates of these two concepts. Many of these results also suggested that the right hemisphere was most important for the processing of spatial cues, while the left hemisphere was suggested to be most important for the processing of temporal cues. The current study tried to provide more evidence for this suggested lateralization. It was hypothesized that the right hemisphere  is dominant for spatial navigation while the left hemisphere is hypothesized to be dominant for temporal navigation. A video of a ‘walk’ through a maze was developed along with two visual half field tasks to determine possible lateralization. Both tasks measured reaction times and accuracy for stimuli presented in the left visual field and stimuli presented in the right visual field. The results are contradicting. It was expected that participants would be faster and more accurate on left visual field performance (LVFP) on the spatial task and on right visual field performance  (RVFP) on the temporal tasks. On both tasks,  participants were equally fast on LVFP and RVFP. However, they were significantly more accurate for LVFP on the spatial task and for RVFP on the temporal task. Based on the results, it impossible to provide a clear answer to the question whether the spatial component and temporal component of navigation are lateralized to a certain point. Based on accuracy results, it seems they might be. Future research should attempt to provide a more definite answer to the question if spatial and temporal component are in fact lateralized."

In recent years the development of particular kinds of institutions, the creation of ethno linguistic fragmentation as a result of colonialism and geography / factor endowments have all been identified as being key to explaining poor growth in Sub Saharan Africa. This study argues that such an approach is flawed, as at a micro level no overarching explanation is sufficient. In addition what most of this research neglects is the crucial importance of African agency on individual countries’ paths of development. This is not to say that such studies are not useful as they do provide avenues of research and theories to test. However this study will ague that contextually specific micro studies, which take local African agency into account are the best approach to understanding long term development. This study focuses on colonial era Nigeria from 1905 to 1932, examining education, health and resistance to British rule and examining long term trends in the post colonial era. It is concluded that in different areas of the country, education and health developed at different speeds and that to explain such differences a variety of factors are needed. In all areas resistance to colonial rule and African agency played a key role in determining the course of development."

cursussen. Gamification, het toepassen van game-elementen op iets wat geen game is, lijkt een goede 
oplossing te zijn voor dit probleem. Door het toevoegen van game-elementen aan een e-learning 
cursus zouden lerenden net zo gemotiveerd en geëngageerd moeten worden als de spelers van de 
games waaruit deze game-elementen zijn geleend. Maar is dit echt zo eenvoudig? Veroorzaken deze
game-elementen daadwerkelijk de motivatie en het engagement van de spelers? Resulteert deze 
motivatie en dit engagement in een educatieve omgeving dan ook in een groter leereffect? 

Uit dit literatuuronderzoek naar het leereffect, de motivatie en het engagement dat game-elementen teweeg zouden kunnen brengen, blijkt dat er bewijs kan worden gevonden dat bepaalde 
game-elementen een mogelijke verhoging in het engagement en de motivatie kunnen veroorzaken. 
Doordat deze resultaten veelal gevonden zijn in de context van een serious game, is het belangrijk dat 
er meer onderzoek gedaan wordt naar het mogelijke effect van bepaalde game -elementen op de

Er is een algemene consensus in de literatuur dat er een positief verband bestaat tussen MUS en NA. Alexithymie, onveilige hechting en trauma worden frequent gerapporteerd door patiënten met psychosomatische klachten. Daarnaast is het gesuggereerd dat alexithymie, onveilige hechting en trauma invloed kunnen hebben op MUS en NA. Voor dit onderzoek zijn de volgende hypothesen opgesteld: (1) MUS en NA zijn positief gecorreleerd, (2) alexithymie en onveilige hechting hebben een negatieve invloed op de relatie van MUS en NA en (3) 
trauma zal de relatie tussen MUS en NA versterken. Methoden: 338 derdelijns psychosomatische patiënten hebben zelfrapportagevragenlijsten ingevuld voor somatische klachten, symptomen van angst en depressie, alexithymie, onveilige hechting en trauma. Vervolgens werden ze onderverdeeld in subgroepen voor hoge en lage scores. Daarnaast werden er twee subgroepen gemaakt voor patiënten die voldeden aan de criteria van type I of type II alexithymie. Resultaten: Correlatieanalyses toonden aan dat MUS en NA positief zijn gecorreleerd, dat deze relatie voor hoge scores op onveilige hechting zwakker is en voor hoge scores op trauma en bij patiënten met type II alexithymie zelfs non-significant bleek. Daarnaast bleken de interactie effecten van type II alexithymie en hoge scores op onveilige hechting en trauma met NA significante negatieve voorspellers van MUS. Conclusie: MUS en NA zijn positief gecorreleerd voor de meest zware patiëntgroep. Daarnaast beïnvloeden type II alexithymie, onveilige hechting en trauma deze relatie.

De verklaringen voor deze etnische verschillen in ouderbetrokkenheid verschillen per dimensie van ouderbetrokkenheid.

Methode: Gesprekken tussen 57 leerkrachten en 214 leerlingen op de nameting van eerder gedaan onderzoek naar de effectiviteit van een taaltraining, zijn gecodeerd met het programma CLAN. Met een frequentie analyse is het aantal voorspellingen, verklaringen en het gebruik van domeinspecifieke woorden bepaald. Met statistische analyses zijn deze gegevens vervolgens tussen de experimentele- en controlegroep vergeleken. Resultaten: De leerlingen van de leerkrachten die de taaltraining hebben gevolgd doen meer juiste voorspellingen en geven meer juiste verklaringen dan de leerlingen van de leerkrachten die deze training niet hebben gevolgd. Binnen deze voorspellingen en verklaringen gebruiken ze meer domeinspecifieke woorden. Er zijn daarnaast verschillende relaties gevonden tussen het gebruik van domeinspecifieke woorden en de voorspellingen en verklaringen. Conclusie: Naarmate het niveau van de gesprekken over luchtdruk omhoog gaat verkrijgen de leerlingen ook meer inzicht in de werking van luchtdruk. Leerkrachten moeten niet bang zijn om met kleuters over wetenschap en techniek te praten."

Het was onduidelijk welke redenen bijdroegen aan niet-regulier vertrek en in hoeverre de hulpverleningsactiviteiten van Nieuw Veldzicht een protectief effect hadden op niet-regulier vertrek. Om hier zicht op te krijgen zijn interviews afgenomen bij twintig medewerkers van Nieuw Veldzicht. In de interviews werden twintig residentiële hulpverleningstrajecten van niet-regulier vertrokken cliënten besproken. De redenen die volgens medewerkers bijdroegen aan niet-regulier vertrek waren onder andere: 1) het ontbreken van motivatie bij de jongere (negatieve attitude); 2) geen ondersteuning of betrokkenheid van ouders, jongeren die zich onder druk van leeftijdsgenoten binnen en buiten Nieuw Veldzicht bezighielden met seks, middelengebruik en/of criminaliteit (negatieve invloed sociale omgeving); 3) een laag zelfbeeld van jongeren (negatief beeld eigen vermogen). Van de zestien hulpverleningsactiviteiten verwachtten de medewerkers een protectief effect van ‘begeleiding door groepsleiding’, ‘mentorgesprekken’, ‘fasering’, ‘muziektherapie’ en ‘beeldende therapie’ op niet-regulier vertrek. Door de vijf hulpverleningsactiviteiten kregen jongeren een positieve houding en/of een positief beeld over hun eigen vermogen ten aanzien van het voortzetten van het hulpverleningstraject. Er waren geen hulpverleningsactiviteiten die ervoor zorgden dat de jongere door zijn/haar sociale omgeving werd ondersteund in het voortzetten van het hulpverleningstraject. Er wordt verwacht dat de organisatie niet-regulier vertrek kan verlagen door het aanbieden van hulpverleningsactiviteiten met een protectief effect op de negatieve invloed vanuit de sociale omgeving van de jongere."

In dit onderzoek is in beeld gebracht welke factoren als randvoorwaarde dienen voor succesvolle samenwerking tussen samenwerkingsverbanden en gemeenten ten aanzien van de verbinding tussen Passend Onderwijs en Zorg voor Jeugd. De mogelijke factoren die invloed hebben op interorganisationele samenwerking zijn in het theoretisch kader in beeld gebracht.

Besef van wederzijdse afhankelijkheid, domeinconsensus en bereidheid zijn de belangrijkste factoren van succesvolle samenwerking ten aanzien van Passend Onderwijs. De statistische analyses wezen uit dat het hebben van een gemeenschappelijke visie en doelstelling en het tonen van betrokkenheid bij Passend Onderwijs voorspellende factoren zijn van meer draagvlak voor duurzame samenwerking tussen het samenwerkingsverband en gemeenten.

Van medewerkers was bekend of zij kennissen of familieleden van cliënten kenden buiten de organisatie. Deze relaties zijn indirecte relaties met cliënten genoemd. Door het percentage medewerkers op de afdeling te berekenen met deze indirecte relaties werden verschillen zichtbaar tussen de afdelingen. Vervolgens is geprobeerd deze verschillen te verklaren met zowel individuele kenmerken van medewerkers als kenmerken van afdelingen en gemeenten waar afdelingen zijn gevestigd. Daarnaast zijn er interviews gehouden met medewerkers van zorgorganisaties om meer inzicht te krijgen in sociale inbedding en de gevolgen ervan voor het behoud van personeel. 
De resultaten laten zien dat op afdelingen waar medewerkers dichtbij de organisatie wonen meer indirecte relaties zijn tussen medewerkers en cliënten. Hetzelfde geldt voor gemeenschappen waarin weinig verhuisd wordt. Ook waren er verschillen tussen afdelingen uit verschillende regio’s en met verschillende typen zorg. 
Verder is uit de interviews gebleken dat voorzieningen een belangrijke rol spelen in sociale inbedding in de buurt en dat medewerkers zowel voor- als nadelen van inbedding kunnen ondervinden. Medewerkers die cliënten indirect kennen kunnen beter inspelen op behoeften van cliënt, maar kunnen bang zijn hun professionele houding te verliezen. Tot slot zijn er aanwijzingen dat inbedding in de buurt kan bijdragen aan de werktevredenheid van medewerkers en op die manier aan het behoud van personeel."

Attitudes van jongeren jegens de politiek zouden zodanig veranderd kunnen zijn dat ze zorgen voor een verschuiving van klassieke politieke participatie naar alternatieve vormen van participatie. Wantrouwen wordt daarbij gebruikt als verklarende factor. Voor de statistische analyse wordt data uit de European Social Survey gebruikt. Het effect van wantrouwen op klassieke participatievormen zoals stemmen, lid zijn van een politieke partij en contact opnemen met politici is negatief. Het wantrouwen onder jongeren is tussen 2002 en 2010 echter niet toegenomen. De hypothese is dat jongeren wel degelijk politiek geïnteresseerd zijn maar dat uitten door op alternatieve manieren te participeren. Voor deze hypothese kon bevestiging worden gevonden. Echter was wantrouwen hier geen verklarende factor. Het is dus waarschijnlijk dat een andere attitude een bepalende factor is in het verklaren van het generatie-effect. Er wordt aanbevolen om in vervolgonderzoek naar de invloed van internet op politieke participatie te kijken."

Through salsa dancing I gained an entrance to the broader research field on the question of what it means to be human. Drawing largely from literature in existential philosophy, -psychology and –anthropology, I explore this question in relation to the notion of the self and to the learning of techniques. This exploration builds upon the transformation of the CATERPILLAR (Cultural Actions Trigger Experientially Responsive Physical Intelligence; Learnt Lived and Recognized) into the CHRYSALIS (Consciousness Has Rejected Your Self As Limited, Isolated, Separated) and the BUTTERFLY (that has escaped the Boxes Used To Trap Ego’s Relations For Lamentable Yearnings). The research insights show that a notion of the self as a bounded entity is hard to sustain. The self is connected to the wider universe. Self-realization builds upon a recognition that human beings are movement and that the self is not skin-encapsulated but connected to the wider universe. At the maximum of self-realization, however, the human being becomes completely immersed in context and thus loses its sense of self."

However, recent studies indicate that parental knowledge is mainly determined by adolescent disclosure. In the current study we explore whether there is a relation between three different forms of parental monitoring (parental solicitation, parental control and snooping) and adolescent disclosure or adolescent secrecy and lying. Furthermore, we examine whether privacy invasion is a mediator in this link. Data was collected using questionnaires which were filled in by 84 Dutch adolescents (Mage =15.06). Our results revealed that there is a link between parental monitoring and feelings of privacy invasion, but that privacy invasion is not a mediator in this link. Parental solicitation as a form of parental monitoring is associated with more willingness of the adolescent to disclose and to report less secrecy. These findings suggest that the most effective way for parents to gain information about the lives of their adolescent children is to ask them questions."

When children learn words, they use two kinds of cues: social cues (looking, pointing) and verbal cues (labeling). Grassmann and Tomasello (2010) examined which kind of cues were mostly used by putting these into conflict: children were shown two objects, while the researcher pointed to one object, and, at the same time, labelled the other object. Children follow pointing over labelling, especially when an unknown label (‘modi’) was used instead of a known label (‘car’). The current study is a replication of the aforementioned experiment and aims to investigate if gender and age affect how toddlers deal with conflicts between pointing and naming. The results show a stronger effect on condition for girls than for boys (i.e. more point following in unknown label condition than in known label condition). They also show that, in the known label condition, the older children followed pointing more often than the younger children. Implications of these results will be discussed."

The project was divided into two separate studies. The first study aimed to investigate the cerebellum’s role in language functioning by comparing patients to healthy controls on a number of language tests (NADL, NWRT, TAK Verteltaak, Verbal Fluency, RAN, EMT, Klepel and six PALPA subtests). A better performance of healthy controls was expected on all tasks in comparison to cerebellar stroke patients. Also, it was expected that patients with left cerebellar damage (n=6) would perform better than patients with right cerebellar damage (n=5). In the second study, the correlation between an implicit grammar learning task (NADL) and an implicit learning serial reaction time task (ILSRT) was measured in order to investigate the relationship between implicit motor learning and implicit grammar learning. A positive correlation was expected, in which better discrimination ability between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences would correlate significantly with greater differences in reaction time between learnt motor sequences and novel motor sequences. None of the hypotheses were confirmed, although a relationship was found between fine motor skills and phonological memory and processing. Language disorders do not seem to be prominent after cerebellar stroke, which suggests either a good functional outcome after cerebellar stroke due to cerebellar plasticity, or a minor involvement of the cerebellum in language functioning."

A within-route method of testing, and a between-route method of testing. The involvement of different working memory components on performance was examined. This was done using a dual-task method, in which participants learn routes from videos while performing a visual, spatial, or lexical interference tasks or without any interference. Participants were also divided between a good and poor sense of direction group, by their score on a sense of direction questionnaire. This allowed for differences in the involvement of working memory components to be examined for good and poor sense of direction participants.  Results showed that performance on the between-route method correlated strongly with other allocentric survey knowledge-type tasks, while the within-route method of testing did not. The between-route method also showed a significant difference between good and poor sense of direction participants, while the within-route method of testing failed to do so. Finally, the different aspects of working memory involved between good and poor sense of direction participants more closely resembled that of earlier research on allocentric survey knowledge on the between-route method. No differences in aspects of working memory conditions compared to their respective control conditions were found on within-route performance. These results provide support for the notion that a between-route method of testing allocentric survey knowledge could be superior compared to a within-route method of testing."

These were include as mediators in the Job Demands-Resources model. Questionnaire data were collected among 104 management trainees (22-34 years, M = 27.8) of a Dutch bank. As hypothesized, person-environment fit partially mediated the relationship between job resources and engagement, but unexpectedly not the relationship between personal resources and engagement. Psychological meaningfulness and –availability also partially mediated the relationship between job resources and engagement, while psychological safety did not. Additionally, person-environment fit, psychological meaning and –availability together fully mediated the relationship between job resources and engagement. Moreover, we found an underlying factor representing these three scales which showed the same mediation effect. These results suggest that job resources may alter trainees’ perception of fit with the work environment, represented by person-environment fit, psychological meaningfulness and –availability, which in turn fosters work engagement. More specifically, especially job resources that foster learning and development (i.e., task variety, feedback, social support and learning opportunities) are important for trainees in this process, whereas other job resources (i.e., job control) seem to be less important."

The study of touch may be especially important in certain mental illnesses such as somatoform disorder, where tactile thresholds are indicated to be deviant from normal. The present study examined the influence of extraversion and neuroticism on the pleasantness rating of affective and non-affective touch. Extraversion and neuroticism have been suggested to modulate emotional experience and emotion processing and might therefore also influence affective touch perception. Extraversion is known to correlate with the experience of positive emotions and was therefore hypothesized to have a positive influence on affective touch perception. On the other hand, neuroticism, which is associated with sensitivity to negative emotions, was hypothesized to have a negative influence on non-affective touch. Pleasantness ratings were obtained during low - affective touch - and high - non-affective touch - velocity stroking to the hands and forearms. Sixty-four participants were assessed using the Big Five Inventory. Subsequently, they were affectively and non-affectively stimulated whereupon they scored this experience. Affect appraisals were correlated with extraversion and neuroticism levels. The present data led to rejection of the hypotheses, showing no influence of extraversion and neuroticism on the pleasantness rating of touch. Perhaps affective and non-affective touch are so crucial in normal development that individual differences in personality hardly affect touch perception in healthy participants. Future research should examine the possible influence of extraversion and neuroticism on more positive and more negative touch stimuli, and in psychiatric populations. Keeping in mind that findings cannot be generalized to other experimental situations or other groups, the present study indicates that the appraisal of affective and non-affective touch is not related to personality characteristics."

When pollution of water is perceived as a problem this could be reduced by investing in sustainability initiatives at the source, e.g. rice farmers. This research therefore also studies the preparedness to contribute to initiatives towards sustainability. This awareness and preparedness is studies by interviewing stakeholders to the Thai water sector and validated by interviews with a control group existing out of international organizations, universities and independent researchers who are professionals in the field of agro-commodity supply chains, sustainability or Thai development. 
The extent of awareness among the Thai water sector and the extent of preparedness to contribute to sustainability lead up to the likability of successful implementation of an incentive mechanism. The incentive mechanism discussed in this study is one based on the concept of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES). PES is a market-based approach to increase sustainability in (Thai) waters, by improving agricultural practices in (rice) cultivation. Thai farmers, through such scheme, are incentivized for the implementation of better agricultural practices, such as reduced agro-chemicals application.  The success of the suggested incentive mechanism, the Book & Claim model, one with low-cost and high flexibility, will be studied through analyzing the characteristics of the model (low traceability and transparency) in combination with the research results about the water sector’s awareness and preparedness and the political and social circumstances affecting the rice supply chain. It will conclude the government to be a valuable partner for further collaboration while other political objectives are resolved and general awareness and preparedness to contribute grows. The Book & Claim incentive mechanism will hold potential, while other factors such as lack of knowledge about the magnitude and causality between rice and water have to be overcome first. 
Further research is needed in the extent of water pollution through rice cultivation and the potential of other (external) stakeholder to the rice supply chain to invest in the Book & Claim incentive mechanism to improve sustainability in the Thai rice-water nexus."

The Rifian Corridor was one of the main marine connections between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean before the Messinian Salinity Crisis (5.97 – 5.33). Previous studies indicated that the Mediterranean became partially isolated from the Atlantic already at 6.64 – 6.44 Ma because of the restriction of this marine connection. The gradual closure of the Rifian Corridor however has been hardly captured stratigraphically since the latest marine deposits are often eroded. In order to specify the processes leading to the closure of the Rifian Corridor a field study was conducted in the Saïss Basin and in the western end of the Gharb basin, located in the mid-western part of the Rifian Corridor. Magnetostratigraphic, biostratigraphic and grain-size results are presented in combination with a sedimentary log of the Neogene deposits at two study-locations near Meknes. Grain-size results are used to correlate and interpret both study-locations. Correlation of the biostratigraphy and polarity sequence of the marl intervals allows an accurate dating of the composite section. The composite section shows an increase in depth related to basin subsidence and is dated at 6.37 – 6.29 Ma. The turbiditic dominated successions show periodic variances in tectonic activity of the source area while subsidence further affected the type of active sedimentary processes. This study furthermore shows increasing influences of bottom current controlled deposits higher up the stratigraphy, indicating changes in the exchange of Atlantic-Mediterranean bottom sea-water. Both sections show different bottom current regimes, the northern section indicates bi-directional flow (E–W & W-E) whereas the southern section indicates dominantly Mediterranean inflow (W–E). The differences in flow regime observed, can be explained by the effect of Coriolis force acting on the water masses in the Rifian Corridor. This theory however enables two scenarios contrasting to present assumptions: 1) another corridor was open and the corridor comprising the study areas was the shallower of the two connections or 2) at the time of deposition, the Rifian Corridor was wider than the assumed width."

Het dringt namelijk steeds meer tot hen door dat de gebouwde omgeving en de voedselverkooppunten van invloed kunnen zijn op de voedselconsumptie van degenen die hier langs reizen en daarmee ook op hun gezondheid. Deze voedselverkooppunten worden in de Engelstalige literatuur ook wel foodscapes genoemd en zijn onderdeel van de voedselomgeving van een persoon. Dit onderzoek richt zich op de studenten die een studie volgen op De Uithof (aan de Hogeschool Utrecht of aan de Universiteit Utrecht) en de reis tussen huis en deze studieplek maken. Hierbij wordt met name onderzocht of er verschillen bestaan in de foodscapes die studenten tegenkomen die gebruik maken van de fiets of van het openbaar vervoer.
De centrale vraag van dit onderzoek luidt als volgt: In hoeverre zijn foodscapes van invloed op de voedselconsumptie tijdens de reis van studenten die tussen huis en De Uithof reizen?
In dit onderzoek is voor het begrip ‘foodscapes’ de definitie gebruikt die beperkt is tot de fysieke aanwezigheid van winkels en restaurants en andere speficieke locaties waar voedingswaren kunnen worden gekocht (zoals cafés en bakkers). Om te kunnen meten wat de invloed van deze foodscapes is op de voedselconsumptie tijdens de reis, hebben de respondenten op twee dagen een voedingsdagboek bij moeten houden tijdens de reis die zij tussen huis en De Uithof hebben gemaakt. Hierin hebben zij onder meer aan moeten geven welke foodscapelocaties zij tegen zijn gekomen en wat zij tijdens de reis hebben geconsumeerd. Hiervoor zijn de gegevens van 74 studenten gebruikt die aan het onderzoek hebben meegewerkt. Naast de invloed van foodscapes is er in de voedingsdagboeken ook gevraagd naar andere kenmerken van de studenten en van de reizen die zij hebben afgelegd. Hiermee is gecontroleerd in hoeverre de voedselconsumptie tijdens de reis kan worden toegeschreven aan het tegenkomen van verschillende foodscapes.
Uit analyse van de resultaten blijkt dat het al dan niet kopen van voedingsmiddelen tijdens de reis niet per definitie lijkt te kunnen worden toegeschreven aan de foodscapes die de student passeert tussen huis en De Uithof. Keuze van het vervoermiddel, geslacht en de mate waarin een student aangeeft te worden verleid, blijken invloedrijkere variabelen te zijn die het eetgedrag van studenten tijdens de reis kunnen voorspellen. Met name de keuze van het vervoermiddel (fiets of openbaar vervoer) heeft hier een aanzienlijk aandeel in."
Effect of overlapping double layers and pH on electrokinetics in a microchannel,"['Mansour Pour, A.']","['Joekar-Niasar, Dr. Vahid', 'Schotting, Prof. Ruud']",2018-07-19T17:03:44Z,en,[],Hydrology,"Electroosmosis in porous media has a very wide range of applications such as soil remediation, oil recovery, subsurface exploration, drug delivery in tissues. In this research, we focus on solving Poisson-Boltzmann equation in a rectangular channel with different boundary, geometrical and pH conditions in order to capture the effective factors in electroosmotic flow (EOF) in a microchannel. 
Based on the results, the electroosmotic flow varies significantly with overlapping condition of double layers, represented by a scaling factor, which is the ratio of half of the height of a channel to Debye length, referred to asK ̅. The other factor is the aspect ratio of the channel, which is the ratio of width to the height of the channel. Results show that the effect of thickness of the electric double layer on EOF is crucial, while the aspect ratio was found to have less effect on EOF.
The pH effects were also taken into account as the changes in pH in known to have significant effect on the state of EOF and electroosmotic permeability can change by orders of magnitude. The results show a decline in EO permeability as the pH increases, if the K ̅ effect on electroosmotic permeability is still important. 
As known, the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation cannot be used for larger zeta potential values as well as constant charge boundary condition. Thus, we showed the effect of ignorance of this nonlinearity for a large zeta potential 60mV. Results show that if a linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation for a large zeta potential condition is used, the electroosmotic permeability will be underestimated and the average electric potential will be overestimated. Moreover, results showed that solving the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation for constant charge condition would not provide realistic results.
The results of this study not only can be used to understand the fundamentals of electroosmosis in porous media but also will be used for upscaling this phenomenon to Darcy scale using a pore network modeling approach."

Synthetics and Green's functions for PREM could be used in the future to perform the first iteration in the optimization procedure of finding a realistic heterogeneous Earth model. To effectively solve the inverse problem of finding a realistic laterally heterogeneous Earth model, more iterations of the optimization procedure are needed, for which synthetic seismograms and Green's functions for laterally heterogeneous Earth models will be required."

Geschiedenis van de scheikunde: Machines en Energie,"['Bijkerk, N.']","['Genseberger, R.J.', 'Pilot, A.']",2018-07-19T17:04:24Z,nl,[],Communicatie en Educatie van de Natuurwetenschappen,"Energie is een begrip dat zowel in het dagelijkse leven als bij natuurwetenschappelijke vakken wordt gebruikt. Het dagelijkse begrip energie heeft echter (een) andere betekenis(sen) dan het wetenschappelijke begrip energie. In het dagelijkse leven wordt het vaak situationeel gebruikt. Wie kent niet uitspraken als: “Ik heb even geen energie meer.” En “Mars geeft je energie!”? Het probleem hierbij is dat de dagelijkse betekenis de wetenschappelijke betekenis van energie in de weg kan gaan staan. Dit probleem wordt tijdens het volgen van het voortgezet onderwijs niet weggenomen. Er is geconstateerd dat er in het huidige voortgezet onderwijs geen goede basis van het energiebegrip wordt gelegd bij de leerlingen (Doménech e.a., 2007; Zegers e.a., 2003). Dit impliceert dat de aansluiting op het wetenschappelijk onderwijs niet naar wens is. 
De cursus Machines en Energie probeert de aansluiting te verbeteren door actief in te spelen op de voorkennis. De cursus kiest voor een vernieuwende aanpak. De eerstejaars scheikunde student wordt aan de hand van een historische context ge(her)ïntroduceerd in het wetenschappelijk begrip energie. Door het volgen van een historische lijn ervaren de studenten welke empirische en theoretische stappen hebben geleid tot de wet dat energie behouden blijft (i.e. Eerste Hoofdwet). De rollen die maatschappelijke en economische vraagstukken destijds gespeeld hebben, zijn hierbij belangrijk. Praktische vragen als:  “Hoe pompen we het water uit de steenkoolmijnen?” hebben geleid tot ontwikkeling van de stoommachine en de ontwikkeling van theoretisch denken over begrippen als warmte, arbeid en energie.
Het onderzoek heeft twee focuspunten. Het eerste focuspunt is achterhalen of tijdens de cursusonderdelen vaardigheden zijn verworven en begripsvorming heeft plaatsgevonden. Het tweede focuspunt is de motivatie van de studenten tijdens de cursus.
Om deze focuspunten te kunnen onderzoeken, zijn verschillende methodes gebruikt. Allereerst heeft de onderzoeker (met behulp van enkele studentassistenten) de colleges geobserveerd en gedocumenteerd. Er zijn aantekeningen gemaakt over de (non)verbale motivatie van de studenten. Ook is er nagegaan of de studenten de kernbegrippen begrijpen door te analyseren hoe ze tijdens de cursus over de begrippen praten. Naast het verbale werk, is ook het schriftelijke werk van de studenten geanalyseerd. De studenten hebben tijdens de cursus twee schrijfopdrachten gemaakt. De beoordeling van deze schrijfopdrachten op gebied van schrijfvaardigheid en begripsvorming kon door de onderzoeker direct gebruikt worden. Verder zijn de studenten aan het einde van de cursus geïnterviewd. Tijdens dit interview zijn de studenten gevraagd hoe gemotiveerd ze waren voor de verschillende onderdelen van de cursus. Ook werd in dit in interview gevraagd hoe hun begrip van energie na de cursus is. Tenslotte is er na de cursus nog een online enquête afgenomen onder de studenten, die de onderzoeker extra informatie over de motivatie kon geven.
De voorkennis van de studenten was niet op het verwachte niveau. De studenten hadden voor aanvang van de cursus Machines en Energie de cursus Fysische Chemie gevolgd, waarin de Eerste en Tweede Hoofdwet uitgebreid behandeld worden. Begripsvorming op het gebied van energie en exergie is daarbij vereist. De interactieve werkwijze in de cursus Machines en Energie zorgde er voor dat de hiaten in de voorkennis zichtbaar werden. Door het stellen van vragen aan de studenten kon de voorkennis geactiveerd en in op niveau geschat worden. Andere scheikundecursussen kunnen daarom ook baat hebben bij meer interactie tijdens de colleges, vooral om na te gaan of de veronderstelde voorkennis in voldoende mate aanwezig is.
In dit onderzoek is ook duidelijk geworden dat de studenten na het volgen de cursus nog niet alle kernbegrippen goed beheersen. Begripsvorming op het gebied van energie heeft maar deels plaatsgevonden, terwijl dit toch het hoofdbegrip van de cursus was. Begripsvorming op het gebied van exergie heeft nog niet/onvoldoende plaatsgevonden. Exergie bleek een begrip te zijn dat te ingewikkeld is om in korte tijd over te brengen op de studenten.
Verder is er uit dit onderzoek gebleken dat studenten veel moeite hebben met het schrijven van wetenschappelijke teksten. De formulering en argumentatie moet eenduidiger worden. Dit zou bewerkstelligd kunnen worden door studenten plenair te laten oefenen met geschreven stukken van voorgaande jaren. Andere scheikunde cursussen kunnen baat hebben bij het oefenen van wetenschappelijk schrijven. Het is vaardigheid die alleen verworven kan worden door veel oefenen en de studenten vooral ook feedback te geven op hun schrijven.
De studenten waren tijdens de cursus Machines en Energie niet altijd even gemotiveerd. Veel studenten gaven aan dat ze de aanpak van de cursus te schools vonden en de gevoerde discussies te gemaakt. De studenten gaven aan dat ze het niveau van enkele onderdelen van de cursus te laag vonden. Maar tegelijk is duidelijk geworden dat er op deze onderdelen onvoldoende begripsvorming heeft plaatsgevonden. De studenten waren zich dus niet bewust van hun eigen niveau."

This to better understand, regulate and grow agricultural crops. Recently, plant defence has been extensively studied; revealing two very important transcription factors involved; MYC2 and MYB72. Both seem to have significant importance in induced systemic resistance (ISR). MYC2 has been previously shown to be important in the regulation of transcription of genes against wounding and herbivory, so the question arises how this gene is also important in ISR and might there be a molecular link between the resistance against pathogens, herbivory and ISR. 
The balance between transcription of genes against wounding and against pathogens is regulated through the balance of MYC2 and ERF1. The expression patterns of multiple homolog of ERF1 and of MYC2 were studied, as well as another related MYB transcription factor. Also the target promoter sequences were studied. Transcription of ERF1 is regulated by EIN3, a close homolog of EIL3. EIL3 is known to interact with MYB72. Here we investigated the predicted expression patterns to establish whether it is plausible that MYB72 regulates the action of MYC2 through action of ERF1. 
Based on the analysis of existing data sets, it seems very plausible the interaction between MYB72, EIL3 and possibly MYB10 regulates the transcription of ERF1 to influence the balance of transcription of genes against pathogens or wounding. However, extensive further research is necessary."

In this paper we apply algorithmic techniques (related to the Directed Feedback Vertex Set and Feedback Arc Set) to determine the minimum size set of breakers necessary to break every loop. Our approach requires significantly fewer loop breakers."

learning can be a good solution. If the data in question has the monotonicity
property, we can classify much more data using fewer queries. The data is said
to be monotone if the class label is known to be increasing or decreasing in the
attributes. The goal of active learning with monotonicity constraints is to use
queried and monotonically inferred data to build a classi?er. A central problem in
active learning is ?nding the best query points. It has been suggested to use the
concept of lower sets to search in the partially ordered sets (posets) that represent
the dataset [3], [2], [8]. We show that this concept can also be used to select good
query points in active learning with monotonicity constraints. Because counting
lower sets becomes very costly quickly, it's hard to test this hypothesis on general
posets. We provide a dynamic programming algorithm that counts all lower sets
in linear time for the special case of a matrix order. We then show that this query
strategy is at most a logarithmic factor worse than the optimal query strategy at
classifying the whole dataset.
We contrast this strategy with a simple but good known greedy heuristic [1].
Testing shows that the lower-set-count strategy outperforms the greedy heuristic in
classifying the whole dataset, but is worse when an a priori set maximum number
of queries is made. Tests are performed on arti?cial and real datasets and the
heuristics are judged based on both the quantity of inferred class labels and their
quality, by means of building a classi?er. These tests lead us to conclude that
the greedy heuristic is very good and that the lower-set-count strategy is not a
promising one for general posets. The latter conclusion is reached by reasoning that
approximating lower set counts, which would be needed, will nullify the marginal
edge over the greedy strategy it might have at best.
The most challenging part of creating arti?cial data is generating random
monotone classi?cation functions. We show how to do this without generating
all of them using the Propp-Wilson algorithm. Furthermore, concerning datasets
with more than two class labels, we show that when building a classi?er after a
restricted number of queries, the classi?er can be improved substantially by using
partially classi?ed data entries in addition to the fully classi?ed data."
wxHaskell for the web: substituting C++ with Haskell and JavaScript,"['Gooijer, R.A. de']","['Dijkstra, A.', 'Swierstra, S.D.']",2018-07-19T17:04:31Z,en_US,"['OOP, Haskell, JavaScript, Language Design, Functional Programming, wxHaskell']",Software Technology,"Traditionally applications were built to run on top of a desktop platform, but this is

a feature-light version of the wxAsteroids game from the original wxHaskell paper
to the browser leaving the source code almost untouched. We have developed
several tools that have helped us realizing the implementation. First, we improved
the existing JavaScript FFI, its surrounding infrastructure, and created interfaces
to the necessary platform interfaces. Second, we have developed a library for
Object-Oriented programming in Haskell, inspired by OOHaskell, that contrary to
OOHaskell does not dependent on functional dependencies. This library has en-
abled us to maintain the wxHaskell interfaces while substituting the wxWidgets C++

Local Implied Volatility: A Market Model Approach,"['Jong, T.V. de']","['Pistorius, M.R.']",2018-07-19T17:04:32Z,en,['Arbitrage-free call price smoothing; Exotic option valuation; Stochastic differential equations; Local implied volatility; Market model; Monte Carlo'],Stochastics and Financial Mathematics,"Option valuation models specifying the dynamics of the stock price directly always face the problem of calibration to the volatility surface, which shows to be a troublesome procedure. Market models take the option price surface as an input of the model and are hence perfectly calibrated to the market. Market models try to specify the dynamics of the option prices, rather than the stock price itself. Due to no-arbitrage constraints, specifying the dynamics of the option prices becomes unworkable quickly. Therefore, the idea is to find a one-to-one parameterization of the option price surface. We then specify dynamics for this parameterization to equivalently have the evolution of the option prices. The dynamics of the parameterization are subject to no-arbitrage conditions, which are either complicated or restricted to a single strike or maturity. Johannes Wissel recently came with a model that works for option prices on a fixed grid of strikes and maturities, without invoking complicated restraints. Based on this option valuation model, we analyze the way such a model works in practice. We find ways to calibrate the dynamics of the parameterization and apply the model to the valuation of exotic derivatives that potentially benefit from this approach, such as forward start options, forward start variance swaps and structured products."
"A Type-Changing, Semantics-Preserving Program Transformation System","['Schuur, B.']","['Jeuring, Johan', 'Leather, Sean']",2018-07-19T17:04:34Z,en,"['Program Transformation, Type Theory, Logical Relations, Dependently Typed Programming, Agda, Haskell, Lambda Calculus']",Software Technology,"Program transformations play a central role in the construction of compilers. Before a source program comes out as machine readable instructions, it has gone through a lot of optimization and simplification steps, preferably without changing the behaviour of the original program.

Traditionally, these transformations work by manipulating the syntactic constructs of a language, and do not alter the types of a program, or are applied to untyped sources. However, in recent years there has been an increasing interest in transformations in type-changing program transformations on typed sources: transformations in which it is possible to change the types together with the terms.

This work introduces an extensible transformation system based on the simply typed lambda calculus, which allows type-changing transformations between terms. The system ensures that a transformation preserves the semantics of the source term, independent of the concrete datatypes and evaluation strategy of the underlying lambda calculus. This statement is formally proven using logical relations and mechanically verified in the dependently typed programming language Agda. Central to the transformation system is the concept of typing functors, a construction which types the source and result of a transformation simultaneously, while allowing changes in types to occur."
Event Execution Reproduction by Log Analysis,"['Gasiewska, J.']","['Prasetya, dr.

Apart from that, an event may also cause a change in the state of the application. This may influence the way subsequent user events are executed. In case an error appears in one of them, it can be a result of a particular context in which the user event is executed and that context is the result of execution of previous user events. We assume the events are logged and our goal is to reproduce the error. First, we need to reduce logged sequence of events by eliminating the events that were not relevant towards the occurred error.  In order not to spoil the production data, the reproduction is executed in a special test environment whose persistent state has the same structure as that of the production version, but is populated with different data.  In our research we target these two issues by defining two terms: event commutativity and data similarity. We have implemented an algorithm that determines if events commute and an algorithm that finds similar data. We have also conducted an experiment that validates our approach."

These findings resulted in a change in the curriculum of the first year biotechnology course of the bachelor’s study of biology at Utrecht University, the Netherlands, where an assignment was created by the course’s coordinator based on the findings of the previous study. In the current study it was evaluated whether this new assignment has led to students acquiring the metacognitive procedural- and conditional knowledge essential for experiment design. A small group of seven first-year biology students who were enrolled in the course participated in the evaluation. In the evaluation the students were tested on their knowledge on cognition by completing an assignment similar to that of the biotechnology course. Results showed that students acquired the necessary metacognitive procedural knowledge regarding experiment design. However, due to a lack of metacognitive conditional knowledge students were not able to apply their knowledge in new situations, rendering students unable to proficiently design experiments for the field of biotechnology. Therefore, it is recommended that changes are made in the current curricula that focus on teaching metacognitive conditional knowledge to students in order to reach the goals of science education that students acquire the knowledge, skills and attitude to perform scientific research."
T-cell education towards self and non-self HLA: an overview of HLA-DP.,"['Jong, M.R.W. de']","['Spierings, E.']",2018-07-19T17:04:37Z,en,"['HLA-DP, T-cell education, HLA']",Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"An overview is presented of the role of the various Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) in the immune response with special emphasis on HLA-DP. In recent years, almost all HLA genes have been studied regarding their molecular and biochemical properties, with the exception of HLA-DP. HLA-DP is a HLA class II molecule that has long be regarded as fairly unimportant, and minimal research has gone into illuminating its molecular and biochemical properties. However, recent results have shown that HLA-DP might be more important than previously anticipated. This overview  summarizes the current knowledge on HLA-DP, and its role in T-cell selection in the thymus. In addition, suggestions for future research are presented. 

The genes coding for the HLA-DP molecule, HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1, were already discovered in 1987, yet there are no  details on HLA-DP expression, except for a commonly sheared mechanism amongst HLA class II genes. It has been shown that HLA-DP cannot be simply compared to other HLA class II molecules when it comes to localization, assembly, trafficking or peptide presentation. HLA-DP has been found to be involved in many different immune related disease, such sarcoidosis, juvenile arthritis, Graves’ disease, graft versus host disease, hard metal lung disease and chronic beryllium disease. Various studies show that HLA-DP plays an important role in either the initiation or progression of these diseases. Within HLA-DP a special role seems to be present for the DPB1*0201 allele, which has been associated with multiple immune diseases. The consequences of this knowledge  will likely influence how we treat these immune diseases. In addition, HLA-DP may also play a role in transplantation disease. As of today, HLA-DP matching is not standard before performing an organ transplantation. However, the new insights in the role of HLA-DP might well change that for the future. In conclusion, although HLA-DP has long been largely ignored, it is now becoming clear that HLA-DP may well be a very important factor for both for (auto) immune and transplantation diseases."

However, the content available there is the same as that what is already in their patient handbook. This means that the treatment is provided digitally in a basic manner. Providing mental health treatments via the internet presents opportunities to improve aspects of the therapy. This research presents several adaptations to the existing online treatment.
Objective: Improve the adherence and motivation of patients in an existing online anxiety treatment protocol by utilizing traits of internet-based health interventions.
Methods: This research constitutes two parts: for the first part therapists have been interviewed; the second part resulted in the development of several adaptations to the online treatment which have been evaluated by means of a pre-condition and a post-condition questionnaire.
Results: 21 participants took part in the questionnaires. The traits of internet-based health interventions have increased (interactivity Δ=3.43, P&lt;.001; multimedia Δ=3.48, P&lt;.001; personalization Δ=2.14, P&lt;.001). The motivation to use the online treatment has increased. The addition of multimedia formats and interactivity in the form of a game had the greatest influence on motivation (score=.592 on a 0-1 scale).
Conclusions: The different adaptations that have been implemented in this research have proven to enhance the pleasure of activities in the online treatment. However, this research has been done on a small scale and without real patients suffering from an anxiety disorder."
Object Sensitive Type Analysis for PHP,"['Hoek, H.E.K. van der']","['Hage, J.', 'Koot, R.']",2018-07-19T17:04:39Z,en,"['Data Flow Analysis, Object Sensitive, Type Sensitivity, Type Analysis, Points-To Analysis, Dynamic Call Graph, Coercion']",Applied Computing Science,"In dynamically typed languages type checking is performed at run-time. Statically typed languages on the other hand perform type checking at compile time, allowing type errors to be caught at the earliest possible stage. In this thesis we describe an object sensitive type analysis for PHP, allowing types to be inferred at compile time. 

The presence of dynamic method dispatching in PHP implies that control flow and data flow information are mutually dependent: propagation of points-to information may make additional methods reachable, which may in turn increase the propagated points-to information. To this end we extended the notion of a Monotone Framework [1]. Our Extended Monotone Framework intuitively captures the notion of a dynamically discovered call graph and enables us to add control flow edges on the fly. In addition, we presented a novel method to capture the coercion rules of PHP by means of the coerce and reject functions. The transfer functions rely on work by Smaragdakis et al.[2] by employing the context manipulation functions record and merge to capture the essence of object sensitivity. Multiple variations of an object sensitive analysis are obtained by choosing different implementations for these context manipulation functions. Finally, our experimental evaluation compare these analysis variations.

When monitoring the quality of a software system the analysis results of multiple versions of a software system have to be interpreted. Stable Voronoi treemaps help with interpreting the analysis results by creating stable and deterministic pictorial representations. This means that insight gained in one pictorial representation can easily be carried over to another.

As part of our implementation of stable Voronoi treemaps we introduce a sweep line algorithm for additively weighted power Voronoi diagrams. The algorithm extends Fortune's algorithm for Voronoi diagrams by adding weights to the Voronoi sites and using the power distance function that takes those weights into account.

To provide stability to Voronoi treemaps we introduce an algorithm based on scaled Hilbert curves that places Voronoi sites in a deterministic manner. By also enforcing a strict order on the data being visualized we can ensure that the pictorial representations remain visually close to each other while clearly showing the difference. 

Using an empirical study we validate our result and conclude that stable Voronoi treemaps are useful for software quality monitoring and software quality assessment in general."

It’s doubly degenerate ground state is responsible for non-Abelian exchange statistics among the Majorana fermions hosted. The non-Abelian exchange statistics nature of Majoranas and their zero-energy “cost” existence make them an ideal candidate for qubits. As qubits they may build a topological quantum memory that is protected from decoherence. The current thesis consists of two main parts.

In SafeTrans a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) can be performed in which a specific transport is simulated in multiple runs subjected to randomly selected historical weather forecast scenarios applicable to the sailing area. Some routes advised by the actual implemented Dijkstra re-route algorithm do not reflect realistic decisions. Experience with Safetrans re-routing has shown several problems and limitations of this algorithm design, such as land-crossings, route generation at fixed speed, optimization for sailing time only and lack of route decision memory.

In this study Anya 3D is proposed, an improved re-route algorithm for SafeTrans MCS that aims at finding the optimal sailing route for a given weather forecast while meeting user-defined weather criteria and admissible ship engine settings. This route is based on a cost function that includes user-defined weights for fuel consumption, sailing time and late arrival penalty.

The basis for this algorithm is Anya, a recently published sketch for an optimal any-angle pathfinding algorithm for 2D environments with grid-based obstacles. This sketched algorithm has been extended for path finding problems in a 3D space and time environment with sea grid cells either blocked or traversable in time depending on the weather conditions. In addition an algorithm is proposed to make a path taut in 3D based on the multi-objective cost function and economical speed.

In simulations, the proposed algorithm is tested and compared to the actual re-route algorithm for route distance, sailing time, fuel consumption and runtime. In addition an implementation is made of the sample-based RRT* pathfinding algorithm in order to compare both Dijkstra and Anya 3D. Experiments have been performed for eight problem instants that contain severe weather conditions, distributed over four shipping routes. The experiments show better route generation with respect to the research objectives for Anya 3D in comparison to Dijkstra when the amount of obstacles is limited. In addition, runtimes of search queries with limited obstacles is shorter than the actual implemented algorithm. For more complex environments the performance of Anya 3D drops as the search space grows exponentially with the number of obstacles. Methods to prune branches of the search tree should be further investigated to avoid exponential growth."

Drama in het Literatuuronderwijs. Onderzoek naar dramateksten in het (literatuur)onderwijs,"['Velde, G. van der']","['van der Knaap, Dr. E.W.', 'van den Bergh, Dr. H.']",2018-07-19T17:05:05Z,nl,"['dramatekst, theater, literatuuronderwijs, ckv']",Nederlandse taal en literatuur,"Dramatiek, lyriek en epiek. Het zijn de drie hoofdgenres die worden onderscheiden in de literatuur en in literatuurmethodes voor het voortgezet onderwijs. Toch wordt aan het eerst genoemde hoofdgenre nauwelijks aandacht besteed. Waar is eigenlijk het drama in het (literatuur)onderwijs gebleven?

Na analyse van diverse onderwijsmethodes (CKV- en literatuurmethodes) werd duidelijk dat er vrijwel geen aandacht wordt besteed aan dramatiek, een abel spel daargelaten. Ook bleken er op vakspecifieke websites, zoals lezenvoordelijst.nl, nauwelijks (hedendaagse Nederlandse) dramateksten opgenomen, op een middeleeuws stuk na. Daarbij kwam uit een enquête naar voren dat docenten eigenlijk geen dramateksten behandelen. Tegelijkertijd bleek dat dramateksten van meerwaarde zijn in het onderwijs en bijdragen aan het bewerkstelligen van de doelstellingen van het literatuur- en cultuuronderwijs en van onderwijs in de algemene zin (Van der Velde, 2012). Waarom wordt er nauwelijks aandacht besteed aan dramateksten in het onderwijs? Welke dramateksten komen er eigenlijk wel aan de orde? Op welke manier worden dramateksten in het onderwijs geïncorporeerd? En welke (on)mogelijkheden zijn er voor dramateksten in het onderwijs? Al deze vragen worden in deze scriptie beantwoord en uiteindelijk worden er suggesties gedaan voor een betere integratie van dramateksten tussen andere teksten als poëzie en proza.

Er lijkt namelijk wel degelijk een wil te zijn om dramateksten beter in het onderwijs te incorporeren. Ook zijn er in de onderwijsdoelstellingen aanknopingspunten om deze daadwerkelijk te incorporeren. Ten slotte zijn er reden (stimuleren creativiteit, afwisselend literatuuronderwijs) om ook daadwerkelijk dramateksten op te nemen in het onderwijs om zo de doelstellingen van het onderwijs beter te behalen. Echter, de kennis van dramateksten onder docenten blijkt minimaal: de werken die zij kennen blijken canoniek, uit literatuurmethodes afkomstig en betreft met name teksten van voor 1880. Om te stimuleren dat dramateksten beter worden gekend en een grotere kans krijgen om ook te worden behandeld, zijn uit het onderzoek enkele aanbevelingen gekomen, zowel voor docenten, beleidsmakers als uitgeverijen en andere betrokken. Een van de aanbevelingen is het aanpassen van de eindtermen van het vwo, door het opnemen van dramateksten in de leeslijst. Op dit moment staat in de eindtermen dat leerlingen met betrekking tot de ´literaire ontwikkeling´ beargumenteerd verslag kunnen uitbrengen van de leeservaringen van de zelf geselecteerde Nederlandse literaire werken (havo: acht, vwo: twaalf, waarvan minimaal drie van vóór 1880). Voor het vwo, zou dit bijvoorbeeld kunnen worden: twaalf, waarvan minimaal drie van vóór 1880 en waarvan minimaal één dramatekst. In Vlaanderen is bijvoorbeeld op deze manier meer aandacht voor theater en dramateksten in het literatuuronderwijs. Een tweede is het opnemen van tekstfragmenten en opdrachten die horen bij dramateksten in de literatuurmethoden. In de literatuurmethodes krijgen proza en poëzie ruimte, door bijvoorbeeld als fragment of voorbeeld te dienen. Kleine aanpassingen in literatuurmethodes zouden dramateksten onder de aandacht kunnen brengen. Het gebruiken van voorbeelden uit dramateksten in plaats van uit proza, zou al een aanzet kunnen zijn. Op deze manier maken leerlingen ook kennis, hoewel summier, met dramateksten."
City of God & Something in the Air: representatie van de favela in Braziliaanse cinema,"['Apperloo, S.']","['Jordão, P.']",2018-07-19T17:05:01Z,nl,"['cinema, favela, Brazilië, representatie, Something in the Air, City of God, film, filmonderzoek, geweld, drugsgeweld, sociale uitsluiting, agency']",Portugese taal en cultuur,"Deze scriptie bevat een analyse van de representatie van sociale problematieken in Fernando Meirelles’ film City of God, en Helvecio Ratton’s film Something in the Air. De analyses maken een verschil zichtbaar mbt. de representatie van (drugsgerelateerd) geweld, sociale uitsluiting en de portrettering van de favelabewoner in beide films. De aanwezigheid van drugsgerelateerd geweld staat centraal in City of God, terwijl dit in de verhaallijn Something in the Air slechts op de achtergrond zichtbaar is. Het getoonde geweld City of God  biedt het publiek weinig diepgang  mbt. de achtergrond van de problematieken, en door het extreem gewelddadige karakter van drugsbendeleider Lil’ Zé (Zé Pequeno), laat het geweld regelmatig een irrealistische indruk achter. De analyse maakt ook een positieve weergave van agency zichtbaar vanuit de hoofdpersoon, Rocket (Buscapé), die ondanks dat zijn omgeving en sociale positie een obstakel vormt in het behalen van zijn doelen, over de capaciteiten bezit om zijn droom waar te maken. Dit, terwijl Lil' Zé uiteindelijk een slachtoffer wordt van geweld. 
De analyse van Something in the Air toont de dat film een aantal belangrijke stereotyperingen, zoals de dominantie van geweld en de slachtofferrol van de bewoners, heeft vermeden. Er wordt de kijker meer diepgang geboden in sociale problematieken als rassendiscriminatie en sociale uitsluiting. Een belangrijk krachtpunt van de film is dat Ratton er in slaagt een beeld schetsen waarin favelabewoners over potentie, kracht en agency bezitten en bovendien door middel van mobilisering in staat zijn om sociale vooruitgang te bewerkstelligen. 
Tot slot erkent deze scriptie dat beide films aspecten bevatten die bijdragen aan een positieve beeldvorming van de favelas, en wordt er gesteld dat er altijd positieve en negatieve kenmerken te onderscheiden zijn in filmprodukties. Dit wordt aangehaald om het belang van filmonderzoek te benadrukken. Globalisering en de voortdurende ontwikkeling van de media hebben als resultaat dat ook in de toekomst het publiek steeds veeleisender zal zijn mbt. de presentatie en kwaliteit van media. Toenemende wetenschappelijke kennis over de ethische waarde van cinema dient beschikbaar te zijn voor filmkenners, filmmakers en het allerbelangrijkste: voor het publiek."

The concept has had many different meanings, and been used in a variety of ways. As part of this discussion cosmopolitan education came about, as a means to educate the young people to be cosmopolitan citizens in a global world. By educating the young minds about the other places of this world, about the politics, culture and other aspects, they will be more associated with other world citizens. However, whether it is desirable and realistic to implement cosmopolitan education is a whole other question. Nowadays the world is very diverse and integrated; this situation is mirrored in the classroom where many different cultures are taught together. This thesis looks at to what extent cosmopolitan education is implemented in the current secondary state-schools in England in order to deal with this diversity. Through a comparative literature analysis, and one interview to clarify and support the main argument, the desirability and implementation of cosmopolitan education will be researched. This showed that it is not desirable that all children should turn out to be cosmopolitans. However, they should be granted the option. Therefore, it is important to take into consideration the cosmopolitan perspective. Governments and educational institutions should strive for a better balance between national and global issues taught at school."

Er is een verandering van het repertoire zichtbaar, waarbij er meer verschillende liederen in de kerken worden gezongen. Deze liederen komen deels voort uit de evangelische stroming. Muzikaal gezien passen de nieuwe liederen meer bij de populaire muziek van deze tijd. De instrumentatie is hierdoor ook veranderd en hierdoor worden de liederen niet langer alleen door het orgel begeleid, maar steeds vaker door bands.

Chatten is vandaag de dag een belangrijk communicatiemiddel. Chatgesprekken met meerdere deelnemers, zogenaamde groepchats, zijn erg in trek. Mensen nemen actief deel aan groepchats in chatrooms, op internetfora en op weblogs. Ook op social media als Facebook zijn groepchats mogelijk. Groepchats hebben niet altijd structuur en de samenhang tussen de interacties (berichten) van de gespreksdeelnemers (in dit artikel discourse coherentie genoemd) is vaak niet of onvoldoende duidelijk. In groepchats hanteren gespreksdeelnemers verschillende manieren om aan de behoefte aan samenhang tegemoet te komen, onder andere door aan te geven op welk bericht ze reageren. Eén van die manieren is addressivity, waarbij de naam of nickname van degene op wiens bericht wordt gereageerd, wordt vermeld in de reactie. Chatrooms en internetfora bieden vaak ook de (standaard) mogelijkheid om de weergave van de chat log op de threaded mode te zetten, waarbij alle reacties op een bericht gegroepeerd bij en onder elkaar komen te staan met als doel om de discourse coherentie te verhogen. De threaded mode is ontstaan uit de time mode. Bij de time mode worden berichten weergegeven in chronologische volgorde en is het daardoor mogelijk dat er tussen een bericht en reacties daarop, vele andere berichten staan, waardoor de samenhang tussen de verschillende berichten minder duidelijk kan zijn. In dit onderzoek is er gepoogd antwoord te krijgen op de vraag of addressivity en de threaded mode bijdragen aan het bereiken van discourse coherentie en tekstbegrip. Vooraf werd verwacht dat dit zo is. 

Uit het uitgevoerde onderzoek komt naar voren dat addressivity invloed heeft op tekstbegrip. Dit komt deels overeen met de verwachting, omdat het onderzoek niet heeft aangetoond dat addressivity ook invloed heeft op discourse coherentie. Verder is, in tegenstelling tot de verwachting, niet aangetoond dat toepassing van de threaded mode tot een betere discourse coherentie en tekstbegrip leidt."

Veel onderzoek is er al gedaan naar de toonhoogteperceptie van kinderen met dyslexie, dit omdat toonhoogte een onderdeel is van klemtoon. Dyslectici blijken een andere klankperceptie te hebben en het vermoeden bestaat dat zij ook een andere klemtoonperceptie hebben ten opzichte van niet-dyslectici. Klemtoon wordt in het Nederlands bepaald door toonhoogte en de duur van een syllabe. In eerdere onderzoeken werden geen gebruik gemaakt van natuurlijke taal. In dit eindwerkstuk werd onderzocht of er een verschil is tussen de toonhoogteperceptie van kinderen met dyslexie en kinderen zonder dyslexie om  vast te stellen of dyslectici een andere spraakperceptie hebben ten opzichte van niet dyslectici. Dit is gedaan door kinderen van 13 jaar oud een same-different experiment te laten uitvoeren. In dit experiment werd gebruik gemaakt van pseudowoorden van twee syllaben die gemanipuleerd werden door het aantal Herz van de eerste syllabe te verhogen, zodat er uiteindelijk elf condities ontstonden van 20 Hz – 120 Hz. Er bleek geen significant verschil in toonhoogteperceptie te zijn tussen de twee groepen en er kan niet geconcludeerd worden dat dyslectici een slechtere klemtoonperceptie hebben dan niet-dyslectici.   
In this thesis I have researched speech perception of children with dyslexia, specifically focusing on their stress perception. Since pitch is a vital part of stress, many studies have researched pitch perception of children with dyslexia. These studies have shown that children with dyslexia perceive pitch differently. They are also believed to perceive stress differently from non-dyslexics. Syllable stress in Dutch is determined by its pitch and duration. As opposed to previous studies, in my thesis I have used natural language to research whether there is a difference in the perception of pitch between dyslexics and non-dyslexics and whether a difference in speech perception between the two groups exists. A same-different task was developed which was carried out by thirteen-year-old children. In this experiment two syllable nonwords were used which were manipulated by increasing the amount of Herz of the first syllable of these words. This resulted in eleven conditions ranging from 20 Hz to 120 Hz. No significant results in pitch perception have been found and therefore I cannot conclude that there is a difference in pitch perception between dyslexics and the non- dyslexics."

Hemmerechts werd er namelijk veelvuldig van beschuldigd middels deze roman de daden van de bestaande Michelle Martin, de ex-vrouw van Marc Dutroux – een ontvoerder, verkrachter en moordenaar van jonge meisjes uit België – te verexcuseren. De uitwerking van het ik-narratief van Odette – de fictieve representatie van Martin – geeft aan dat dit beeld genuanceerd dient te worden: zij is namelijk als verteller onbetrouwbaar en als lezer hoeven we niet altijd mee te gaan in haar verhaal. Hoewel zij wel degelijk over haar schuld nadenkt, vermijdt ze confrontaties met de meest pijnlijke gebeurtenissen uit haar verleden en is zij inconsequent in haar vertelling. Bijzonder is hier het gegeven dat Odette slechts tegen zichzelf ‘vertelt’, waardoor zij niet als intentioneel onbetrouwbaar gezien kan worden. Haar onbetrouwbaarheid is van een meer psychologische aard."

Aim: To describe the morphosyntactic development in VP children diagnosed with SSD and to explore the relation between the phonological and morphosyntactic development. 
Methods: An observational, prospective study of twenty VP children diagnosed with SSD. Morphosyntactic development was analysed using ‘Grammaticale Analyse van Taalontwikkelingsstoornissen’ (GRAMAT). GRAMAT provides an overview of the most frequently used morphosyntactic structures of typically developing children between the ages of one and four years old. In this study the morphosyntactic structures of VP children at 2;0-2;6 years of corrected age were described. The relationship between linguistic outcome measures was studied.
Results: GRAMAT-analyses showed many inadequacies and a morphosyntactic delay of at least half a year in VP children with a SSD for the particular age-group of 2;0 – 2;6 year. Statistical analyses showed that phonological proficiency is related to morphological complexity. 
Conclusion: The nature of the speech and language problems of VP children of this particular age-group can be compared to the speech and language problems of FT children. To obtain an overview of the morphosyntactic structures for the remaining GRAMAT age-groups and the relation with phonological development, a longitudinal design is needed to ensure an effective intervention is provided which may improve long-term outcomes."
Therapeutic potential of targeting cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles in cancer.,"['Donkerbroek, L.A.']","['Slijpers, Monique']",2018-07-19T17:06:01Z,en,"['Cancer, cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles, phospatidylserine, Rab27a, ceramide']","Cancer, Stem Cells and Development Biology","For many years, cancer has been viewed as a disease resulting from an accumulation of mutations and subsequent transformation of healthy cells into malignant cells 1. Only recently, this view dramatically changed when cells were  found to be able to communicate through the release of extracellular vesicles (EV) and that cancer cells release increased amounts of EVs 2,3. Multiple studies subsequently revealed that these cancer cell-derived EVs (CCEVs) play various roles in cancer progression. CCEVs were found to promote cancer progression by stimulating malignant transformation, angiogenesis, metastasis, modulation of the immune system and chemotherapeutic resistance 1. The fact that CCEVs seem to play multiple roles in cancer progression, makes CCEVs interesting targets for anticancer therapy. So far, no studies have been conducted that were specifically designed to evaluate the anticancer potential of targeting CCEVs, because the EV field of research is in its earliest phases and too much about CCEVs is currently unknown 2,4. Nevertheless, multiple studies actually designed for other purposes did some CCEV-inhibiting experiments and found that inhibition of CCEVs’ actions resulted in profound anticancer responses. Of these, were studies targeting phospatidylserine, Rab27a, ceramide and studies investigating the effects of pretreatment with proton pump inhibitors 5–8. These studies together, prove that inhibition of CCEVs results in anticancer responses and should led to more studies in the future that fill the gaps of knowledge to facilitate further developments in this promising field."

Background Staff, working at the High Intensive Care (HIC) in mental health care, needs to be sensitive to the possibility that their inpatients feel unsafe. It is unknown if staff-members are aware of the feelings of unsafety of psychiatric inpatients. 
Aim and research questions The aim of this study is to gain understanding of the perceptions of staff, regarding inpatients’ perceived feelings of safety and the way staff encourages these feelings in their work in order to advance feelings of safety of psychiatric inpatients. Research questions are: (1) “What are the perceptions of staff, working at the HIC in mental health care, about patient's perceived safety?”; and (2) “In which way do staff encourage patient's perceived safety in their work?”
Method A qualitative descriptive design was chosen, using convenience sampling. Interviews with ten staff-members working at the HIC were conducted. The Grounded Theory approach was used for data analysis.
Results Two main themes arose from data-analysis: 1) awareness of staff about perceived unsafety of psychiatric inpatients; and 2) interventions and attitude of staff to advance feelings of safety. 
Conclusion Differences were found in the degree of knowledge about the terminology and the perceptions of staff about inpatients’ perceived feelings of unsafety. This variety in interpretation of, and dealing with, perceived unsafety implies that the staff-members of the HIC act on basis of their individual knowledge and experience.  Greater awareness of staff about perceived feelings of unsafety of psychiatric inpatients is required to improve patient safety in mental health care. A consistent policy in treatment and interventions at the HIC is recommended to advance perceived feelings of safety of inpatients.

Samenvatting

Het perspectief van verpleegkundigen, werkzaam op de High Intensive Care in de psychiatrie, ten aanzien van gevoelens van onveiligheid van psychiatrische patiënten. 

Achtergrond Verpleegkundigen, werkzaam op de High Intensive Care in de psychiatrie, moeten rekening houden met gevoelens van onveiligheid van psychiatrische patiënten. Het is onduidelijk of verpleegkundigen zich bewust zijn van ervaren gevoelens van onveiligheid van patiënten. 
Doel en onderzoeksvragen Deze studie beoogd inzicht te krijgen in het perspectief van verpleegkundigen ten aanzien van de gevoelens van onveiligheid van psychiatrische patiënten en de manier waarop verpleegkundigen deze gevoelens waarborgen in hun werk. Onderzoeksvragen zijn: (1) “Wat is het perspectief van verpleegkundigen, werkzaam op een HIC in de psychiatrie, ten aanzien van gevoelens van onveiligheid van psychiatrische patiënten?”; en (2) “Hoe waarborgen verpleegkundigen gevoelens van onveiligheid van psychiatrische patiënten in hun werkzaamheden?” 
Methode Deze kwalitatieve studie hanteert een generiek beschrijvend design. Data werd verzameld door interviews met tien verpleegkundigen. Om tot een beschrijving van thema’s te komen, werd gebruik gemaakt van de Grounded Theory benadering. 
Resultaten Het perspectief van verpleegkundigen ten aanzien van gevoelens van onveiligheid, werd onderverdeeld in twee thema’s: (1) bewustzijn van gevoelens van onveiligheid van psychiatrische patiënten; en (2) interventies en houding van verpleegkundigen om gevoelens van onveiligheid te voorkomen. 
Conclusie Verpleegkundigen hebben geen eenduidig beeld van gevoelens van onveiligheid van patiënten en zijn tijdens hun werk niet bewust bezig met het creëren van gevoelens van veiligheid van patiënten. Gevoelens van onveiligheid worden bespreekbaar gemaakt als verpleegkundigen een verandering in gedrag waarnemen. Verpleegkundigen moeten zich bewust zijn van gevoelens van onveiligheid van psychiatrische patiënten om er voor te zorgen dat de ervaren onveiligheid minder wordt. Het is aanbevolen om een consistent beleid te ontwikkelen waarin verpleegkundigen aandacht hebben voor ervaren gevoelens van onveiligheid van psychiatrische patiënten."

Formele uitgangspunten bij dit onderzoek zijn de scholingsvisie en de disciplines zelf, persoonlijke uitgangspunten zijn de visie op vorming en het centraal staan van de leerling.Na een verkennend literatuur onderzoek zijn op basis van een vijftal voorgeconstrueerde vragen pracktische gegevens verzameld. Deze vragen bestrijken globaal vier gebieden: de eigenheid van het vak, lesmethoden, raakvlakken en samenwerken. Daarnaast zijn 4 lesmethodes onderzocht met de vraag in hoeverre de vakken in deze methodes met elkaar verbonden worden. Uitkomsten van dit onderzoek wijzen erop dat de leerlingen in hoofdlijnen geen verschil ervaren tussen beide vakken. Docenten willen in hoofdlijnen samenwerken en de uniciteit van het vak behouden en methodes zetten vooral in op[ raakvlakken."

In dit artikel wordt beschreven of educatieve gezelschapsspellen ingezet kunnen worden bij het leren van nieuwe woorden. Uit een onderzoek en een enquête onder een 80-tal jongeren blijkt dat educatieve gezelschapsspellen (om woorden te leren) inderdaad goed kunnen worden ingezet bij het leerproces van nieuwe woorden.

Montessori Onderwijs - Uitgaan van Eigen kracht,"['Huisman, G.']","['Koster, Bob']",2018-07-19T17:01:55Z,nl,['Montessori Onderwijsresultaten Waarden IDU Visie'],Leraar Voorbereidend Hoger Onderwijs in Algemene Economie,"Het is niet eenvoudig om zo even te vertellen wat de kracht van het gekozen onderwijsmodel op je school is. Op het Haags Montessori Lyceum (HML) worstelen we met het gegeven dat de opbrengsten onder druk staan. 
Dat is een hevige tegenvaller. Je gelooft in iets, je gaat uit van je eigen kracht en je blijkt te struikelen. Een eerste reactie op een crisis is …crisis management: snel ingrijpen op de processen. Leerlingen beter binnen houden, orde in de klas, laten  inschrijven voor keuze-uren, duidelijker structuur in de les met kop-romp-staart. En als dat geïmplementeerd is en de resultaten vallen nog steeds tegen en je Montessori karakter blijkt te verminderen, dan heb je een urgent probleem. 

Waarom hadden we nog maar weer gekozen voor Montessori-onderwijs? Waarom dachten we dat we daarmee leerlingen konden stimuleren in hun persoonlijke groei inclusief de mooie examenresultaten?
Dat is de centrale vraag die gesteld wordt. Het verbeteren van de resultaten MET behoud van Montessori-onderwijs is als strategisch beleid bestempeld. In een mail van 2 december 2011 vraagt de nieuw benoemde rector om het meedenken in het vinden van “patronen” die een aanzet geven tot bewustwording en plan d’attaque. 

Dit document geeft niet op alle vragen tegelijk antwoord. Waar alle docenten worden uitgenodigd “patronen” helpen op te sporen, zou je vermoeden dat in de meer exacte secties de vaardigheden en inzichten bestaan om dit te kunnen doen. De handschoen is opgepakt om uit de gangbare praktijk van het natuurkunde en economie-onderwijs data te verzamelen. Sommige zaken zijn niet direct te begrijpen. Je leert ze te begrijpen door er mee bezig te zijn. 

Er zijn tools ontwikkeld om de patronen in kaart te brengen. Cijferanalyses, opzet van proefwerken, dynamische ontwikkeling van cijferbeelden na bespreking met een klas over een aantal jaren, gekoppeld aan leerlingenenquête, examenresultaten en IDU-cijfers.
Binnen de natuurkunde en economiesectie is het lesmateriaal zodanig aangepast dat het de leercurve van de leerling ondersteund door de onderbouw en vervolgens in de bovenbouw. De zelfstandigheid gekoppeld aan het vertrouwen dat iedere leerling geleerd kan worden het zelf te doen, zijn de uitgangspunten geweest van deze ontwikkeling. Er zijn in dit document beschouwingen opgenomen over de effecten ervan teneinde voorzichtig de patronen ervan neer te kunnen zetten.

Uiteraard is er veel meer onderzoek nodig en dat zal zeker gebeuren met nieuwe bezems die schoon vegen. Het is de docent die in zijn lessen heel wat kan doen. Het is de samenwerking binnen secties die de uitgangspunten verder brengt en het is het overleg tussen secties dat de eenduidigheid en kracht nog verder kan versterken. Sommige zaken kun je niet of nauwelijks verbeteren. Kinderen zijn kinderen met hun eigen competenties. Wanneer een bepaald niveau niet gehaald kan worden of wanneer een leerling elders beter op zijn plek is, dan moet je ook daarop kunnen sturen. Dit zijn zaken die in samenhang met de uitgangspunten van dit document gezien moeten worden en voorlopig buiten de bevindingen liggen."
"Moderne Pelgrims in de vallei van de reizende entrepreneurs, Een onderzoek naar culturele veranderingen ten gevolge van etnisch toerisme in Otavalo, Ecuador.","['Veldscholten, I.G.']","['Jara Gomez, Fabiola']",2018-07-19T17:02:06Z,nl,['Culturele Antropologie; Ecuador; etnotourisme; mondialisering'],Culturele antropologie en ontwikkelingssociologie,"The World we live in is getting smaller and smaller. Processes of globalization have spread images, peoples and cultures all over the world. Because of this different cultures more and more get into first hand contact and influence each other. One of the ways this happens is true tourism. This sector has taken an import place in many peoples lives in the last half a century since it spreads many people and their money over different areas of the earth.  
The Otavalos who live in the northern Andes of Ecuador are known for their handicrafts, music and indigenous culture. Every Saturday the market is visited by thousands of tourists, who are the main economic resource for many Otavalos. Besides the masses who disappear again after the market is over, there’s always some tourists that stay for a couple of days to get to know more about the local culture. These ethno tourists are usually looking for traditional – exotic -  culture, but to receive them a community already changes. Their income and daily practices focus on the tourists and the are confronted with their culture because they have to think about the aspects they want to share with the tourists. This again can influence the way the see themselves and certain aspects of their culture. This thesis describes the way in which Otavalos have commercialized different aspects of their culture to be able to sell them to tourists. The considerations that they make in this process are an indication for the way they try to keep their ethnicity while searching for their place in a globalizing world.

There’s different ways anthropologists can look at the interaction between local and global. Many theories that were written down some years ago are based on the concept of acculturation; the idea that the weaker culture will adapt to the stronger one. But situation in Otavalo shows that many developments can’t be cought in one-way schedules. Tourism in this region comprises a complex whole of interactions between tourists and inhabitants which exist on totally different levels. These levels are shaped bij expactations of the other, which are usually based on images and ideas produced by a third party – for example a travel guide.
History partly explains why the Otavalos managed to keep control over the development of tourism in their region. They were always artisans who travelled around to sell their goods. When they regained their freedom after some centuries of colonial rule, they spread all over the world to market their handicrafts and music. From these travels they brought back ideas for the development of tourism in the region, which shows that they adapted to this new market from within. This enabled them to react at changes in the global market while consciously staying in touch with their traditional culture. Thereby they make a difference between products that don’t mean to much to them anyway because they were always produced for the market and cultural aspects that are meaningful for the community. The former are changed and manipulated as much as possible to make money, while people are supposed to be more subtle in sharing the latter with outsiders.
This shows that the model of creolisation fits better to describe reactions of the Otavalos to processes of globalization. Theories that are based on acculturation – like the invention of tradition and reconstructed ethnicity – describe processes that do happen in Otavalo, but they happen in a more complex way then described in the initial theory. While searching a way to keep their ethnicity, while partaking in the globalizing world, Otavalos constantly reconstruct aspect of their culture to stay in touch with their roots. At the same time new traditions come into being because of the connection with other cultures.  

We can’t stop things from changing, and this happened in Otavalo even before the arrival of the first bus with tourists. The Otavalos show that it is important for people to be conscious about the changing world around them so they can decide what part of their live and culture they are willing to share with others. Cultural aspect will change no matter what, whether they are sold to tourists or just fit to the ever changing world. The way they change and the thoughts behind it determine the new value for both the community and their visitors."

Verder hebben zij tijd nodig om hun ervaringen in het buitenland te verwerken en af te sluiten, voordat zij zich weer volledig op hun leven in Nederland kunnen richten. Hier komen zij gedurende hun verblijf in het buitenland nog niet aan toe, omdat zij nog te veel verweven zitten in het leven in het gastland. Het re-acculturatieproces blijkt bovendien samen te vallen met een bewustwordingspro¬ces van wat er veranderd is (of juist niet) voor de retur¬nee op per¬soonlijk, sociaal en situationeel vlak en in hoe h/zij naar de wereld om zich heen kijkt. Met name door de jonge leeftijd waarop de respondenten in het buiten¬land hebben gewoond, blijkt de uitwisselingservaring veel invloed te hebben op hun leven bij terugkomst.

children with an emotional story about a boy or girl of their age and asking them how the story made them feel. Furthermore, a computer ball game task measured the behavioral expression of empathy by simulating a ball game in which the child had to choose between
self-gain or empathy and act accordingly. ADHD children received lower empathy ratings from both their parents and their teachers, with the exception of parental affective empathy ratings. Self-reports on the story task did not differ between the two groups. In the ball game
task, children with ADHD were equally sensitive to the distress of the child but let him become maximally sad more often than healthy developing children. Finally, the amount ofsymptoms of inattention and impulsivity/ hyperactivity could not predict empathy levels in
children with ADHD in any of the measures. Overall, our results show that cognitive empathy
and the behavioural, but not verbal, expression of affective empathy were affected in children
with ADHD. Implications are discussed."

Three measures were used for determining the severity of AVH; the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) total score, the Hallucinations Change Scale (HCS) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) item three. The AHRS total score and the HCS showed improvement in both groups after rTMS treatment. The HCS showed a trend towards significance indicating greater improvement after 20 Hz rTMS treatment compared to 1 Hz rTMS treatment. At last, the patients in the 20 Hz treatment condition had lower scores in general on the AHRS total score, and there was a trend towards significance for the same effect for the scores on the HCS.

However, it is still unknown if these biases are related to an oversensitive threat detection system that high trait anxious individuals are thought to possess. To test this hypothesis, this study examined the relationship between attentional biases to threat, fear- potentiated startle and skin conductance responses. An unselected sample of participants (n=30) completed an emotional cuing task and a startle- and skin conductance procedure in which they were presented with neutral face stimuli. One of the faces (threat cue) was followed by an aversive noise while the other was not (neutral cue). Startle- and skin conductance responses were then measured. Participants reacted faster to valid trials than to invalid trials on the emotional cuing task. However, they did not differ in the speed of their responses on either neutral or threatening trials. Contrary to expectation, skin conductance responses were not related to any of the measures, while fear potentiated startle only showed a negative relation with engagement scores. Implications are discussed."

Sensory Processing Sensitivity and Parenting predicting Behavioral Activation System activation","['Berg, I.']","['Szabo, N.']",2018-07-19T17:02:26Z,en,"['Differential susceptibility theory, Sensory Processing Sensitivity, Behavioral Inhibition System, Behavioral Activation System, Consistency in parenting, Responsiveness in parenting']",Development and Socialization in Childhood and Adolescence,"The 'differential susceptibility theory' states that some children are more susceptible to parenting, in a 'for- better-and-for-worse' manner (Belsky & Pluess, 2009). The current study aimed to examine if Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS) influences the effect of parenting on child adjustment and if this influence is conform the 'differential susceptibility theory'. I examined the relation between SPS, consistency and responsiveness in parenting, Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) activation and Behavioral Activation System (BAS) activation in order to answer these questions. Two hundred six mothers and twelve fathers completed web based questionnaires about their children (116 boys and 104 girls). Children with low SPS seem more susceptible to parenting and they have, depending on the parenting style, either the  highest or lowest BAS activation, conform the differential susceptibility theory. BIS activation seems an aspect of SPS as a system which pauses behavior in order to process the environment more thorough. Consistency in parenting seems to have a negative effect on BAS activation, perhaps because of discouraging punishment for attractive but inappropriate behavior. Responsiveness seems not related to BIS/BAS activation. Co-occurrence of BIS and BAS activation may indicate co activation of the BIS and BAS in order to orchestrate complex behavior."
The influence of manic episodes on grey matter volumes and general intellectual functioning in bipolar I patients.,"['Schöls, C.P.']","['Abramovic, L.']",2018-07-19T17:02:27Z,en,"['Bipolarity, bipolar I, manic episodes, grey matter volume']",Klinische en Gezondheidspsychologie,"Objective: This study focused on the effects of manic episodes on total brain and grey matter
volumes and general intelligence (IQ) in patients with a bipolar type I disorder (BPI). Volumetric
reductions of the total brain and grey matter have been observed in patients with BPI. In
addition, cognitive impairments are found to persevere in a euthymic state, which implicates
enduring poorer cognitive functioning after mood episodes. The severity of the illness, including
the number of mood episodes, has been related to these structural and cognitive impairments.
The precise relation of manic episodes on neuroanatomical changes and change in cognitive
functioning remains inconclusive, and will therefore be examined in this study. Methods: A total
of 64 euthymic patients diagnosed with BPI and 45 healthy control subjects participated in this
study. The BPI diagnosis and the euthymic state were verified using the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IV disorders (SCID-I). Participants completed a number of questionnaires, a
structured interview, and five neuropsychological tasks. Of the participants, 62 patients and 16
control subjects participated in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up appointment,
which included a number of structural scans. Results: Patients had smaller total brain volumes
than control participants, but similar grey matter volumes. No relation between grey matter
volumes and general IQ was found. However, patients had a lower general IQ compared to
controls participants, whilst the groups did not differ in premorbid IQ. Furthermore, patients
who experienced multiple manic episodes showed a larger decrease in general IQ compared to
patients who experienced a single manic episode. Conclusions: This study indicates that manic
episodes have a specific negative effect on total brain volumes and general IQ. Since the level of
general IQ has been related to the functional outcome of the disorder, a higher number of manic
episodes can have a negative effect on the psychosocial level of functioning and the quality of life
of patients. Future research should therefore continue to investigate the effects of manic
episodes on a structural as well as a functional level."

A cross-sectional survey was completed by 384 young adults (M age = 22.56 years, SD = 1.76) to measure components of the TPB and use of ecstasy by friends and the young adults themselves. Regression analyses showed that only attitudes towards ecstasy use (of the TPB) were significantly related to ecstasy use, and this relation was fully mediated by intentions to use ecstasy. There was a significant interaction between intentions and the ecstasy use of friends: the relation between intentions and ecstasy use was significantly stronger for young adults with more friends who use ecstasy. This interaction was not significant when the ecstasy use of friends was dichotomized to having or not having friends who use ecstasy. Having friends who use ecstasy does not directly affect the relation between intentions and ecstasy use by young adults. The findings provide some support that the ecstasy use of friends is an important determinant to explain why intention leads to actual ecstasy use of the young adult."

In dit onderzoek wordt gekeken naar de visies van organisaties op de overgang van onderwijs naar werk in de gemeente Raalte. Methode: Weinig is er bekend over visies van organisaties op de overgang van school naar werk bij jongeren, daarom is gekozen voor explorerend onderzoek gedaan door middel van halfgestructureerde interviews. In dit onderzoek zijn in totaal vier medewerkers geïnterviewd, van Humanitas, Vluchtelingenwerk en Workfast. Deze organisaties hebben in meer of mindere te maken met de doelgroep in de overgang van onderwijs naar werk. Resultaten: De onderzochte organisaties delen zelfredzaamheid als doel bij de begeleiding bij jongeren, maar geven hier alle drie een andere invulling aan. Humanitas en Vluchtelingenwerk ervaren daarnaast belemmeringen voor deze jongeren, zoals de taalbarrière, cultuurverschillen, het moeilijk zoeken van hulp en een beperkt sociaal netwerk. Workfast komt deze belemmeringen (vrijwel) niet tegen. Conclusie: Tussen de betrokken organisaties is discrepantie te zien bij de ervaringen met migranten- en vluchtelingenjongeren binnen de gemeente Raalte. Bovendien is de groep hulpbehoevenden volgens Humanitas en Vluchtelingenwerk groot, maar komt Workfast deze jongeren zelden tegen. De gemeente Raalte wil met haar beleid omtrent de transitie samenwerking tussen organisaties verbeteren. Hierbij lijkt het belangrijk visies op de hulpbehoefte van migranten- en vluchtelingenjongeren in de overgang van onderwijs naar werk, meer op een lijn te krijgen. Zo kan een meer eenduidige hulp geboden worden aan deze kwetsbare groep jongeren."
Persian Movements: Congruence between script directionality and movement direction & its impact on time perception,"['Hofman, T.']","['Li, X', 'ter Kuile, H']",2018-07-19T17:02:32Z,en,"['ervaren inzetbaarheid, PsyCap, job crafting, psychosociale leeftijd']",Methodology and Statistics of Behavioral and Social Sciences,Li (2014) has shown that congruence between the spatial grounding of time and movement direction leads to faster perception of time passage in Dutch participants. This study was designed to assess whether this effect can be attributed to script directionality. By tasking Iranian bilingual participants to read and write in Persian (from right to left) it was excepted that after this priming task a movement from right to left would be perceived as faster as opposed to faster time passage of a movement from left to right (as is the case in Dutch participants). No clear results were found for the reversal of the effect in Iranian participants nor was the same effect found as in Dutch participants. Thus the results provide no backing for the hypothesis that script directionality is the main influencer in faster time perception of a left to right movement. A possible limitation of the study was that some  participants had too much experience in western script directionality which distorted the results. Analysis of a subsequently sent questionnaire suggested that a significant portion of the tested participants represented  the past on the left and showed the same time perception effects as Dutch participants. Future research should test participants that are only fluent in Persian to assess whether the effect does reverse in Iranian monolingual participants.

The view-conditions were: Large lecturer/small Power-Point, Small lecturer/large PowerPoint and No lecturer/large PowerPoint. No difference was found between the conditions on enjoyment for the lecture. It is believed that other aspects of a lecture, such as lecturer appeal and story, have more influence on enjoyment than just the visibility of the lecturer. For attention a significant difference was found for the second weblectures the participants saw. Participants report more attention in the view-condition with a large lecturer and small PowerPoint, than in the other two view-conditions, while controlling for lecturer appeal, story appeal, subject relevance, radio listening and attention in a lecture-hall. There is no significant trend of visibility and attention, and lecturer appeal does not moderate the relationship between visibility and attention.

Here, we report the two following studies. Study 1 concerned constructing of a valid measure for reality substitution (the RSQ-18). The results indicated that all three scales of the intensity dimensions (immersion, empathy and satisfaction) had good internal reliabilities (>.7; though immersion was at .616), factor loadings (except for immersion: 47.472%), test-retest reliability (>.7) and convergent validity (GEQ, Gamer Experience Questionnaire) as well as divergent validity (SCL-90-R, Symptom Checklist 90 Revised). The results almost fully supported the internal validity of reality substitution according to the RSM, though various additional interaction effects were found. Study 2 concerned the testing of the predictive validity of this measure (and by extension part of the Reality Substitution Model). The results indicated that playing intensely and frequently and for long periods of time (as predicted by the RSM and measured by the RSQ-18), does not increase dysfunctional outcomes. The primary (and often sole) predictor of outcomes (PTM, Prosocial Tendencies Measure; UBOS, Utrecht Burn-out Scale; BPAQ Short Form, Buss and Perry Aggression Questionnaire Short Form) was the intensity dimension. The UWES (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale) was unrelated to the RSQ-18 and its scales. The RSQ-18 is not yet able to predict the nature of video game outcomes, though its intensity dimension lends itself well for future study. In closing, we discuss several suggestions for development of the RSM and the RSQ-18."

Methods: This study included 43 sexually abused pre-adolescents from age 8 to 12, a total of 17 non-traumatized pre-adolescents and 31 pre-adolescents who experienced other traumatic events. Self-esteem was measured with the Self-Perception Profile for children (SPPC) and the self-views were measured with the Statement Test. The Traumatic Event Screening was used to examine if the pre-adolescents were sexually abused. Finally, a semi-structured interview was held to examine the self-esteem of the pre-adolescents more in-depth. Results: The findings revealed that sexually abused pre-adolescents have a significant lower self-esteem in comparison with non- traumatized pre-adolescents, however not in comparison with children who experienced other traumatic events.. In the interview sexually abused pre-adolescents indicated that they had feelings of sadness, angriness, feelings of wanting to be alone, loneliness, self-blaming and suicidal feelings relating to their low self-esteem. Secondly, pre-adolescents who were sexually abused used more negative words in their self-descriptions in comparison with non- traumatized pre-adolescents. However, there was no difference in the use of  negative self-descriptions between sexually abused pre-adolescents and pre-adolescents who experienced other traumatic events. Conclusion: The present research shows that it is important to examine the possibilities of trying to intervene with children’s self-esteem and self-views in interventions, since it appears that sexually abused pre-adolescents in South Africa have a low self-esteem and tend to see themselves mainly in a negative way."

De invloed van transparantie op de werking en acceptatie van nudging,"['Rijk, M.A.']","['Gillebaart, M.']",2018-07-19T17:02:54Z,nl,[],Kinder- en jeugdpsychologie,"Onderwerp:In huidige studie stond de vraag centraal of transparantie de werking van nudging beïnvloedt. Daarnaast werd onderzocht wat de mening van de doelgroep is ten opzichte van nudging. Vanuit eerder onderzoek werd verwacht dat transparantie geen effect heeft op de werking van de nudge. Daarnaast werd verwacht dat deelnemers een positieve mening hebben betreft nudging en gezond eten daarbij wenselijk vinden.
Methode: Het onderzoek werd afgenomen in zes supermarkten. Er werd gekeken naar de afzet van gezonde producten. Bij de helft van de supemarkten werd een bordje geplaatst (transparantie) om deelnemers te wijzen op de nudge. Bij de andere helft van de supermarkten werd dit niet gedaan. Hiernaast is informatie over acceptatie van nudging verzameld door afname van een vragenlijst. De participanten bestonden uit 180 personen waarvan er 90 geworven werden in de nudge-plus-transparantie supermarkten en 90 in de nudge supermarkten. 
Resultaten: Uit de resultaten van deze studie blijkt geen significant verschil tussen de groei van afzet gezonde producten van supermarkten in de transparantie-plus-nudge conditie en supermakten in de nudge conditie tijdens de nameting in vergelijking met de voormeting. Daarnaast bleek de acceptatie en dus mening van de deelnemers ten opzichte van nudging zeer positief. De acceptatie verschilde niet tussen de deelnemers van de twee condities. 
Conclusies: Transparantie kan worden ingezet om het vermeende manipulatieve karakter van nudging te reduceren zonder dat dit ten koste gaat van de werking van nudging. Daarnaast kan op basis van de resultaten gesteld worden dat mensen over het algemeen positief tegenover nudging staan ongeacht of er transparantie wordt toegepast of niet.

Crowdfunding: An innovation for innovation? - An exploratory study of the role of crowdfunding in entrepreneurial organisations.,"['Gernaat, D.E.H.J.']","['Faber, J.']",2018-07-19T17:03:42Z,en,"['crowdfunding, investment, financing, finance, entrepreneurial, business, firm, SME, adoption, innovation']",Science and Innovation Management,"Availability of investment capital is one the most daunting problems for firms. The OECD has indicated that a significant number of firms could use funds productively if these were available. A problem especially pressing for (innovative) small and medium sized companies (SME’s). A financial innovation is on the rise that allows entrepreneurial organizations to collect investment capital through social networks on the internet, otherwise known as crowdfunding. This study focuses on the investment type of crowdfunding where investors financially benefit from participating. The current perception of the adoption of this innovation by firms will be investigated, leading to the following main research question: 

Do firms perceive crowdfunding as a viable alternative for financing investments?

The theory of adoption and diffusion theory has been used as a theoretical framework, leading to a conceptual model of the willingness to adopt crowdfunding as a way to collect investments by the entrepreneurial firm. Empirical data was collected by means of a survey among a representative sample of 2000 firms in the Netherlands with a response rate of 10 %. Using Pavitt’s taxonomy of main economic activities to compare the original sample with the sample of respondents, no systematic biases were found. The empirical model shows a significant 44% explained variance and may prove itself useful for future research in order to measure the expected adoption rate of innovations. 

The entrepreneurial firm perceives a relative advantage of crowdfunding on two dimensions as compared to existing financial services, namely the perceived chance of successfully acquiring investment capital via crowdfunding and market exposure through crowdfunding. Both dimensions are positively related with the willingness to use crowdfunding as a way to acquire investment capital. A third dimension, business network extension through crowdfunding, shows a strong positive correlation with market exposure (r = 0.8) and may therefore be regarded as an additional explanatory dimension of  the concept of relative advantage of crowdfunding. Current degree of involvement in crowdfunding or company circumstances are not related with the willingness to use crowdfunding as a way to acquire investment capital. Apparently the perception of crowdfunding is more important than particular firm circumstances. The degree of involvement is, however, considered low. Over 80% has never or only vaguely heard of the concept of crowdfunding."

Excursions of the geomagnetic field show deviating directions and a strong decrease in intensity and they are thought to be caused by the same geodynamo processes as reversals. In this study we attempt to assess the properties of the paleofield during the Laschamp and Blake excursions by investigating 15 lava flows (28.6 - 154.9 ka) from Mount Etna on Sicily. Directions of the magnetization are obtained and the paleointensity is acquired by three different absolute methods (Thellier-Thellier, the original multispecimen protocol, and the domain state corrected multispecimen protocol) and one relative method (pseudo-Thellier).

Five sites were selected based on the preliminary measurements and yielded technically good results with all paleointensity methods. The Thellier-Thellier method yielded the highest paleointensity for these sites, which are taken as an upper bound. The MSP-DB method produced lower values that are taken as a lower bound for the paleointensity. Results of the MSP-DSC method were not reliable as they were clearly affected by alteration during subsequent heating steps. The calibration formula of the pseudo-Thellier method seemed not applicable to these specimens. A new calibration based on one of the absolute methods, however, could not be made. Resulting paleointensities range from 30.9 μT to 122.3 μT and could not be correlated to either the Laschamp or the Blake excursion. Two other sites might be related to the Laschamp excursion based on the age and direction, but a paleointensity could not be obtained."

It is therefore important to investigate the uncertainties in tomographic models produced by inverse problems with multiple solutions. Conventional methods to analyze model quality all have shortcomings, which we discuss in this report. As an alternative, we use the the null space shuttle technique (Deal and Nolet, 1996). This method has been designed to exploit components of the model null space, along with a priori information or a physical model, in order to improve or enhance the original solution. We generalize the null space shuttle technique to analyze the robustness of a global P wave speed perturbation mantle model PMIT08 produced by a classical study of travel time tomography (Li et al., 2008) and examine a range of models that is consistent with the travel time data. We find that the RMS amplitude of velocity perturbations within this set of solutions ranges from 0.2 to 0.6 % in the lowermost mantle and 0.3 to 1.3 % in the upper mantle and deduce that the travel time data provide little constraint on the amplitudes of the solution. Furthermore, solutions exist that contain structures different in geometry than those imaged in PMIT08. Upper mantle portions of slab-like anomalies are altered or removed from the tomogram in some regions, while the vertical extent of low-velocity anomalies in PMIT08 appears to be poorly constrained. On the contrary, most slab-like anomalies in the lower mantle seem to be robust. We strongly advise against physical interpretations of a single solution of an underdetermined tomographic problem. The null space shuttle technique is straightforward to implement and can be utilized in an efficient way to analyze the solution robustness. We suggest that this technique should be routinely applied before physical interpretation of tomographic images are made."

This study builds upon recent work by Sadeghi (2012), which studied the effect of hydrochemical conditions on virus fate and transport. Through experimental column studies using bacteriophage PRD1, Sadeghi (2012) found that virus attachment processes could be quantitatively described by changes to IS, pH and calcium. However, no correlation between chemical conditions and the coefficient for kinetic detachment were found. In this study, the effect of calcium on attachment processes was explored at pH 6, thus expanding on the work of Sadeghi et al. (2012), which was conducted at pH 7. A 3-D sigmoidal relationship was found to relate pH, calcium concentration, and sticking efficiency at a constant IS of 10. Additionally, the effect of hydrochemical step-changes in calcium and IS were included, with the purpose of quantifying instantaneous step-changes to virus transport processes. Through modeling of the remobilization processes, it was shown that the coefficient for kinetic detachment could be modeled as a function of changing IS and calcium conditions with respect to time."
Let if flow! Capacity development in Bunda's water system,"['Lok, J.']","['Broekhuis, Dr. Annelet']",2018-07-19T17:03:41Z,en,"['capacity development, systemic perspective, systemic thinking, water and sanitation']",Stadsgeografie (Urban Geography),"Capacity development is, as a development tool and approach, used by many organizations working in development coop-eration. It aims at improving capacities of actors, organizations and institutions in developing countries. However, effective capacity development is dependent on many different variables. It seems to be difficult to design a capacity development process that has sustainable impact. The LVWATSAN Programme of UN-HABITAT also offers capacity development to the stakeholders in the towns that receive assistance. This is emphasized because investments in hardware are the first side of the coin. The necessary flipside to sustain the hardware investments is capacity development. The specific town under research is Bunda. This is a secondary town, part of the LVWATSAN Programme. This thesis seeks to identify the capacity of Bunda’s water system and the contribution that capacity development can make to contribute to an improvement of this capacity. It turned out that there is space for improving the capacity of Bunda’s water system. However, there are serious questions whether the capacity development process within LVWATSAN is able to contribute to improving the capacity of Bunda’s water system."
"Safe Streets, Nice Neighbourhood?: Analyzing the relationships and differences in the determinants of the perceived safety and reputation of a neighbourhood","['Valentijn, S.L.']","['Bolt, G']",2018-07-19T17:03:42Z,en,"['Safety, reputation, subjective neighbourhood characteritics, Utrecht']",Economische geografie,"Perceptions of a neighbourhoods' safety and reputation are formed through multiple determinants. Research has investigated these determinants, but mostly focused on the effects of objective neighbourhood characteristics. This present research attempts to comprehend how subjective neighbourhood characteristics influence perceptions of neighbourhood safety and reputation. Furthermore, it also investigates the relationship between the perceived safety and reputation of a neighbourhood. The results indicate a strong influence of subjective neighbourhood characteristics on both perceptions, with especially perceptions of disorder being significant. Finally, the results clearly revealed a relationship between the perceived reputation and safety of a neighbourhood and vice versa."

More specifically, we developed a methodology that takes a set of activity sequences from a Hospital Information System to analyze patient careflow.

We developed a data-based methodology able that provides insight into patient careflow, based on a standardized data structure from the Dutch DBC Information System and other external resources. This approach provides a set of techniques able to analyze any type of care profile, for any specialism, within any hospital and combinations of either. After an initial data collection, an event log is prepared containing high-level activities describing the logistic carepath of patients. Secondly, different types of care profiles are identified by clustering using a Partitioning Around Medoids algorithm based on the Tanimoto distance between paths. The third step is to apply classification in order to identify the main characteristics of each type of profile. As a fourth and final step, each cluster is analyzed using the Trace Alignment plugin in ProM, which allows the identification of both a cluster’s main process pattern and specific deviations from this process for individual carepaths.
A variety of insightful visualization techniques allows medical specialist to interpret the results of this methodology without specific knowledge on the Data and Process Mining techniques. The insights gained from this methodology support the improvement of patient careflow in three different ways: by treating patients according to the cheapest path with the highest quality of care, by improving standardization of carepaths and by developing a robust, optimal operating schedule using predictive modeling based on the patient types defined by this analysis."
Identifying and Characterizing Communities in Social Networks,"['Pool, S.H.']","['van Leeuwen, Matthijs', 'Siebes, Arno', 'Bonchi, Francesco']",2018-07-19T17:04:30Z,en_US,"['community detection, description, behavioral and demographic\ninformation.']",Applied Computing Science,"Methods for detecting community structures in graphs already exist for many years. This subject is studied by physicists, sociologists and also computer scientists. Traditional methods consider only the vertices and edges, we call this graph data. In social networks much more information, in addition to the graph data is available. This can be demographical information, hobbies or any other interest people put online; we refer to this kind of data as description data. Traditional methods try to partition the vertices in groups according to a quality measure like modularity. These methods do not allow overlap; all vertices are member of exactly one group.
In real social networks, communities have overlap, for example your friends and your family. Thus, a good method for finding communities in social networks should allow communities to overlap. Other interesting information can be obtained by exploiting the description data. A very useful application is identifying which elements of the description data characterize a community.
In this thesis we study this problem, with the goal of finding the top-$k$ communities in a certain data set. We introduce an algorithm which alternates between two steps. The first is finding closely linked vertices on the graph side with a fast and effective hill climbing algorithm. The other is reducing the description complexity of this community. The algorithm starts with a candidate set, and the algorithm is applied on each community one by one. This allows communities to overlap with the communities found before.
To evaluate our methodology, we performed experiments on real world data obtained from a number of online social networks, i.e. LastFM, Delicious, and Flickr. The results show that the proposed method identifies interesting and overlapping communities, characterized by detailed descriptions. Visualizations of both the subgraphs and the descriptions contribute to an easier interpretation and thus better understanding of the communities.
At the end we are able to find cohesive communities with concise descriptions, in large data sets, within a relatively short amount of time."
Boundary crossing in a clinical chemistry program with conjoined periods of learning and working,"['Mekes, I.E.']","['Bakker, A.']",2018-07-19T17:04:29Z,en,"['boundary crossing, transitions, action, interaction, continuity, discontinuity, good practice, conjoined periods']",Science Education and Communication,"The purpose of this article is to provide insight into boundary-crossing processes in conjoined periods of learning and working. By means of a multiple case study a clinical chemistry program in post-secondary vocational education (MBO) with conjoined periods of working and learning is analyzed. This analysis is leaded by the central question: How is boundary crossing between school and work fostered in a clinical chemistry program that we consider a good practice of conjoined periods of learning and working and what can still be improved? The idea behind conjoined periods of learning and working is that there is continuity in actions and interactions between school and work, but in many cases it is known that students experience boundaries. Semi-structured interviews were held among students, supervisors, teachers and the manager of the study program to gain information about the actions and interactions in students’ transitions between school and work, and points for improvement according to all stakeholders. Observations were made at school and in the workplace for triangulation and to find specific examples. The results of the analysis suggest that factors like a good organization at school and in the workplace, project implementation and a joint meeting of teachers and supervisors on a regular basis stimulate a successful process of boundary crossing. These and the other results are an important contribution for a better understanding of fostering boundary crossing in situations with conjoined periods of learning and working."
Reducing the overhead of data transfer in data-parallel programs,"['Visschers, P.A.']","['Swierstra, S. Doaitse', 'Kastelijn, Maurice']",2018-07-19T17:04:28Z,en,"['GPU, data transfer, tiling, GPGPU, pipelining']",Software Technology,"Graphics processing units (GPUs) have evolved to allow for general purpose many-core programming. Most GPUs have their own separate memory, requiring that input data be transferred to the GPU before running the program and transferring the results back to the CPU upon completion. This transfer of data imposes significant overhead that we would like to reduce. A possible solution is to split up a program into many smaller pieces, called tiles, and then setting up a pipeline that overlaps data transfers with program execution (on the GPU). This can reduce the overhead of data transfers significantly. 

We examine the effectiveness of several variations of this tiling/pipelining transformation for a common class of programs. We introduce a model that predicts the run time performance of these transformations ahead of time, as well as a recipe that guides users in transforming their code. We show that one of these transformations provides a good speed-up, which for some problems is over 2 times faster than versions that do not overlap data transfer and program execution. Finally we show that our model accurately predicts the run time of programs using this transformation."

The Stepmother tries to reach an overflow by adding one liter of water to the graph every turn, after which Cinderella tries to prevent an overflow by emptying an independent set.
The bucket number is the minimal bucket size needed for Cinderella to prevent an overflow and with that win the game.
We looked at small graphs, holes, anti-holes and perfect graphs and determined the bucket numbers for all holes, perfect graphs, graphs with at most 6 vertices and some small anti-holes.
We also investigated a greedy strategy where every turn Cinderella tries to remove as much water from the graph as possible and determined the greedy bucket numbers of most graphs that we had the regular bucket numbers of.
We also prove that determining the bucket number in an offline version of the game in NP-complete."
